8f432db4f9cb0b215209bdeac7a08e7f29db730c	a practical approach to lighting design course in an electrical engineering programme	lighting design;illumination;problem based learning;electrical engineering;virtual learning environment	Technology has allowed new insights and creativity into the learning and teaching process and also enables to try out in a much more flexible, dynamic way other learning experiences. This constitutes in itself a more engaging role for teachers as well as students helping them to explore and create new areas, opening up, at the same time, new perspectives into the process and maximizing the availability and use of the current tools which the same technology provides. The facilitation in the investigation work development of projects renders the learning and teaching activities really appealing, allowing at the same time levels of effectiveness in this extremely modern and global era. This study integrates technology in the learning process and evaluation of its various outcomes. This case study describes the experience of two teachers with their class along a semester using computer aided technology for instruction and assessment. The task involved the lighting design of monuments with the purpose of attracting the on lookers’ attention, enhancing the beauty and attributes of the façade of monuments or buildings considered relevant or of public interest. An approach of reinforcement learning applied to the historical monuments light configurations will be described.	electrical engineering;experience;reinforcement learning;rendering (computer graphics)	Manuel Travassos Valdez;C.

We wanted to create an information system that was more intelligent than previous BOTs working on the level of ELIZA, i.e. on the basis of a simple pattern-matching algorithm. Our paper describes the use and implementation of technologies for these steps and discusses pros and cons of our implementation in comparison to alternative solutions, including the vector-space-model, the cosine similarity and web search with n-grams.	interactivity;user interface	Emmanuel Günther;Bettina Harriehausen-Mühlbauer	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39476-8_8	user interface design;knowledge management;data mining;natural user interface;user interface;information retrieval	HCI	-65.24387278772588	-27.183683529908773	58522

We consider the potential of ‘IDN for change’, before we describe the project, the underlying design approach and the educational approaches. A particular focus of this paper is on pedagogical considerations. We describe the educational challenges we have encountered during the project as well as the pedagogical interventions we have implemented to counter these difficulties. On this basis, we discuss a more general perspective on the state and issues in IDN-focused pedagogy.	internationalized domain name	Teun Dubbelman;Christian Roth;Hartmut Koenitz	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-04028-4_69	multimedia;computer science;the arts;psychological intervention;narrative	HCI	-73.56750216324939	-36.7858168022411	58561

This study sought to explore this by applying two DCog frameworks, DiCoT and the Resources Model, to the analysis of infusion pump use in an Intensive Care Unit. Data was gathered through observations and interviews, and then analysed using DiCoT and the Resources Model to construct models representing the social structures, information flows, physical layouts and artefact use involved in infusion administration in the ICU. The findings of the study confirm that DCog can be a methodology of choice for studying healthcare work: nurses collaborated significantly, artefacts played a major role in coordinating activity, and the physical environment influenced activity – properties which DCog effectively supports reasoning about.	distributed cognition;international components for unicode;social structure	Atish Rajkomar;Ann Blandford	2011			library science;simulation;engineering;knowledge management	HCI	-72.25182162082056	-26.39575458879846	58689

Themain focus of these efforts is to explore the possibility of fully integrating computers into the classroom, and not juston a single computer-per-classroom basis. Another reason for the interest in this research is the growing number ofuniversities, which have built fully computerized campuses. For example, Acadia University, see [MacDougall et al.1998, and Tomek et al. 1999] has been involved in building such a campus; it provides fast network connections forall students living on the campus as well as electronic classrooms (a setting in which every student and the teacherhave access to a personal computer, and all the computers are networked see [Shneiderman et al 1995]), allowing forvarious types of computer-supported interaction. Computerization of a campus is a very expensive operation and ithas to be proven to be cost effective. While hardware for th e above initiative is readily available, there seems to be alack of software that takes advantage of these hardware facilities and at the same time is known to be useful inlearning and teaching. Groupware or computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) refers to computer-basedsystems that provide an interface to a shared environment in order to support groups of people working towards acommon goal, see [Grudin 1994, Norman 1996]. A related area, Collaborative Virtual Environments, CVEs is alsogetting a lot of interest, see for example [West et al 1998].

This material is collected and systematically described by services like the Learning Resource Server Medicine (LRSMed) at http://mmedia.medizin.uni-essen.de/portal/. With the LRSMed E-learning modules are made available for medical students by means of a metadata description that can be used for a catalogue search. The number of resources included has risen enormously from 100 in 1999 up to 805 today. Especially in 2004 there was an exponential increase in the LRSMed's content. Anatomy is still the field with the highest amount of available material, but general medicine has improved its position over the years and is now the second one. Technically and didactically simple material as scripts, textbooks, and link lists (called info services) is still dominating. Similar to 1999, there is not one module which could be truly referred to as tutorial dialogue. Simple material can not replace face-to-face-teaching. But it could be combined with conventional courses to establish some kind of blending learning. The scene of free E-learning modules on the WWW is ready to meet current challenges for efficient training of students and continuing education in medicine.	alpha compositing;anatomic structures;education, continuing;learning disorders;server (computer);textbooks;www;world wide web;exponential;general practice (field)	Jürgen Stausberg;Martin Geueke;Kevin Bludßat	2005	Studies in health technology and informatics		world wide web;blended learning;metadata;scripting language;computer science	Web+IR	-70.85986076513164	-28.97024210165677	59389

This paper investigates how the Higher Education (HE) sector can use its growing expertise in learning technology implementation to develop effective SME management development solutions. It is found that there is potential for the development of new learning technologies by business schools for use in SMEs, but the process is complicated by the need to ensure materials are adapted to the SME learning context. This is explored through the development of the Learning Technology Practice Framework (LTPF), leading to five key recommendations for HE educators, learning technology developers, SME trainers and public funding bodies to consider.

5bd47c03d9683f6b47d0271702fc41fd18c34866	blended learning: the view is different from student, teacher, or institution perspective		There have been many attempts to define blended learning or hybrid learning. The purpose of this article is to present the views of the authors on defining the concepts of blended learning based on the perspectives of instructors, students, and administrators. Depending on the perspective model used, there can be implications on budgetary and support issues to institutions. Developing successful blended learning programs requires a sound institutional strategic plan. Best practices will be presented as reference for instructors to plan and implement a successful blended learning program.		Gordon Lee;Wilfred W.

The material has been updated in August 2001 and, at the suggestion of the students, some explanatory diagrams which were at the time drawn on the whiteboard have been included in more polished form. The scale of electronic document collections has grown dramatically in recent decades. Test collections of the 1960s and 70s (such as Cranfield [9]) contained thousands of documents; the initial TREC collection of 1991 [21] reached almost a million; and the collections indexed by current Web search engines contain approximately a billion. Information Retrieval (IR) has been associated from its beginning with the analogy of “looking for a needle in a haystack.” Extending this metaphor to very large scale, we see that the haystack is now big enough to cover Australia! Furthermore, enthusiastic farmers have filled it with every possible type of item, including many which are very similar to needles but which are not what the searcher wanted. Most items include instructions on how to go directly to other items, but often the instructions are misleading or out of date. Now there are not only needles but sewing machines, business cards for tailors, needle exchange services, needle-sharpening services, a sewing technology futures exchange, catalogues of needles available for sale or hire and directories of where to find needles within the haystack. Unfortunately, cunning businesspeople have inserted items which look identical to needles but which turn out to be pictures of naked women or advertisements for getrich-quick schemes. Millions of searchers arrive each day to search and they do so with the expectation that they will find what they want within less than two seconds. Some of them are very demanding; they are looking for a particular individual needle and they will not be satisfied unless they find it first. Others want to find as many different needles as they can. Some just want to get an overview of the types of needles which are “out there”. A few start looking for needles but when they find one, realise that what they really wanted was a can-opener or an air-ticket to Hawaii! This chapter attempts to cover the changes which occur when document collections and searcher populations become very large. It addresses the major engineering challenges imposed by very large scale search (particularly on the World Wide Web), outlines parallel and distributed models and canvasses the problem of how to evaluate the effectiveness of very large scale retrieval.

Additionally, many teachers entering the workforce are far more likely to use computers for personal purposes rather than in the classroom (Keengwe, 2007; Keengwe & Onchwari, 2009). Consequently, there is need to motivate, train, and equip teachers with the skills, knowledge, and pedagogical framework to effectively teach with technology tools. This article reviews the constructivist pedagogical framework and the critical issues related to technology integration in schools. This article advocates the need for teachers to embrace constructivist teaching strategies to enhance meaningful teaching and learning in modern technology-rich classrooms.	computer;internet;pedagogical agent	Jared Keengwe;Grace Onchwari	2011	IJICTE	10.4018/jicte.2011100101	psychology;mathematics education;constructivist teaching methods;computer science;knowledge management;teaching method;pedagogy;constructivism	AI	-75.76319013454295	-35.12589483158558	59795

Because of the introduction of ubiquitous computing and the internet of things a new approach to education is required. The educational vision is redesigned from three sources: first, the traditional approach of competences and requirements, secondly, an example course which addresses the ongoing developments in the research area, and, thirdly, a World Café session to generate ideas about the characteristics of Media Technology people and their work in a relatively distant future. As such, the future vision is redesigned by treating it as a media product and applying the creative methods and tools from its own professional practise.	internet of things;requirement;ubiquitous computing	Geert de Haan	2014		10.1145/2637248.2637273	simulation;computer science;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-69.6725095303115	-36.80558304966173	60103

After giving an overview of the training program as a whole, the aspect of database training is emphasized. One form of intensive database training is the database workshop, presented by the database supplier staff (often in conjunction with search service staff). A second form is the database seminar, where searchers investigate topics on diverse databases and systems, and then report to each other in an informal setting. This proved to be a popular and cost-effective training technique, especially for search strategy. The two kinds of database training seem to complement each other. 4 figures, 1 table.	e-services	Jo Robinson	1980	JASIS	10.1002/asi.4630310206	library science;feasibility study;computer science;knowledge management;data mining;database;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval;information system	NLP	-70.13420738901374	-25.467850322499768	60309

We argue that it is viable to extend the applicability of current mobile technology to research support systems by analyzing research activities and mobile support systems. The objective of this research is to integrate and introduce the mobile technology in building effective research support systems.

Participants were 630 science teachers of Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics from both public and private senior secondary schools in 12 Local Government Areas in Kwara State. The data collected through questionnaires tagged Science Teachers Information and Communication Technology Perception Questionnaire (STICOTEPQ) were analysed using frequency count, mean, chi-square and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) statistics. Findings revealed that (i) the science teachers’ perception of ICT was generally positively low and (ii) there was significant difference in the secondary school science teachers’ perception of ICT for instruction based on their area of specialization{F(3,252) = 50.323, p<0.05}with the Biology teachers having the highest level of perception while the Mathematics teachers had the lowest perception. The implication of this study was that should the secondary school science teachers remain at this level of perception of ICT for instruction, the probability that ICT will be used for classroom instruction in Kwara State is very low. It was therefore recommended that ICT should be fully integrated into science teacher education at the Colleges of Education and the Universities and that Kwara State Government should formulate a programme of ICT training and retraining of teachers currently in service as a way of improving their perception of the use of ICT for instruction.

Surprisingly little is known about this """"blogging by the rest of us"""", especially from the blogger's point of view. This paper presents the preliminary results of an ethnographic study of blogging as a form of personal expression and communication. We characterize a number of blogging practices, and then consider blogging as personal journaling. We find blogging to be a surprisingly versatile medium, with uses similar to an online diary, personal chronicle or newsletter, and much more.

It is obviously boosted by a range of new technologies, which enable new modes of learning that, are independent of time and place through Web-based delivery and computer-mediated communication. However, innovators in education often encounter intrinsic conservatism or even deliberate obstructions. For innovators it is important to be aware of and to understand the basic premises underlying the idea of innovation. This paper explains the origins of technological optimism and the associated faith in progress. Also, techno-pessimism as rooted in the negative side effects of the industrial revolution is reviewed. To solve the conflict between techno-optimism and techno-pessimism we elaborate Borgmann’s “devices paradigm“: in order to avoid apathetic and indifferent consumption of technology-based commodities, users of technological devices should be given the opportunity to develop substantial involvement with the technological devices. While extending this idea to educational technologies, we present an explanatory model for the mediating role of technological artefacts. In conclusion, we explain how to approach technology-based innovations in education by arguing for transparent and interactive devices, for products as carriers of meaning, for values that harmonise with the characteristics of man and for a mixed mode of developing new ideas and preserving former	computer-mediated communication;intrinsic dimension;programming paradigm	Wim Westera	2005	Educational Technology & Society		psychology;information and communications technology;educational technology;social science;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;electrical engineering;management science;sociology;management;pedagogy	HCI	-72.03446094712706	-31.56358124771913	61264

Researchers concluded this was due, at least in part, to a variety of external barriers that prevented teachers from using technology in ways that aligned more closely with their beliefs. However, many of these barriers (access, support, etc.) have since been eliminated in the majority of schools. This multiple case-study research was designed to revisit the question, â€œHow do the pedagogical beliefs and classroom technology practices of teachers, recognized for their technology uses, align?â€​ Twelve K-12 classroom teachers were purposefully selected based on their awardwinning technology practices, supported by evidence from personal and/or classroom websites. Follow-up interviews were conducted to examine the correspondence between teachersâ€TM classroom practices and their pedagogical beliefs. Results a c Purchase Export	align (company)	Peggy A.

5e4ebd3c132e5e027cdae51051d9888476f91446	the e-book learning system with problem-based learning in a public health nursing practice course		Following the advance of technological innovations and the ensuing popularity of technological equipment, technology has become a crucial part of modern existence. Learning devices with technological advantages, like the PDA Tablet, E-book, etc., have become components of mainstream instruction. These devices have been applied to aid instruction in Medicine, Nursing and other fields. Problem-based learning (PBL) is a learner-centered instructional method which has its origins in medical education. Therefore, this study attempted to integrate the PBL strategy into the E-book learning system for a Public Health Nursing Practice Course. In their learning process, learners need to organize and prepare health education data before home visits, as well as related home visit data which was collected and arranged through case study and PBL question/answer sessions. Based on this data, the present study not only provided learning achievements in the public health nursing practicum, but also spread related public health knowledge (e.g. information on colorectal cancer, etc.) to each participant before their home visits.

We had a PC system that consisted of 598 Windows PCs, printers, and servers. The number of terminals was not enough for 18,000 students. We introduced a new system of 712 iMacs and servers without printers this March 2009. The reasons are as follows: 1) to provide students and teachers with a better educational ICT environment, 2) to increase the number of terminals for students, 3) to decrease the undesirable cost for print service, and 4) to make it possible for users to reset their login password by themselves for their convenience.  We were worried that students and teachers would be confused by the sudden change of operating system from Windows to Mac OS. Since our university has a Campus Agreement with Microsoft, we can provide the students and teachers with Windows and its applications on Mac OS X. This agreement made it possible to change the educational ICT environment from Windows to Mac base to easily improve the user interface. It would have been very difficult to introduce only the Mac base system without the Windows software.  We also stopped the free printing service for students and teachers. Our university has, by policy, committed to reducing paper use. By doing this we could also promote the Web learning system in our environment. However, it was very difficult to abolish all printers. We investigated the number of pages which students used in a year, and estimated the cost to students to make this a pay service. As a result, we set-up several fee-charging printers in our campuses instead of free printing services. This attempt succeeded in sup-pressing the use of papers.  The new system began operation in March 2009. We had a serious problem with file server performance. We also experienced problems with the difference of file usages between Windows and Mac OS. We report the details of our experiences with the installation, operation, and effects of the new system in this paper.	computer terminal;file server;login;microsoft windows;operating system;password;printing;server (computing);system 7;user interface;world wide web	Naomi Fujimura;Hitoshi Inoue;Satoshi Hashikura	2009		10.1145/1629501.1629532	simulation;engineering;multimedia;computer security	HCI	-67.85186888729673	-25.985475844042018	61765

The process involves programming knitting machines using CAD systems, which are designed for and used by the technicians. The designers get much less training and access to the CAD systems than they want. This paper examines why this is, and what would be involved in creating a situation where the designers are empowered over the technology of knitwear design. It concludes that the limitations of the technology cause this situation, which is reinforced by economic and attitudinal factors.

c7122c345d57d65f892f00156743f81e2339fb6c	mapping curricular ecologies		The impact of socio-economic changes and technological advancements is prompting many educational institutions to re-think the processes of planning, designing and delivering courses in Higher Education. The effect is a re-emergence of the importance of curriculum design. The aim of this research is to investigate the efficacies and potential applications of graphically ‘mapping’ the interrelated educational needs, aspirations, concerns, and other vital interests of students, their families, teachers, administrators, employers, and policymakers, toward increasing the relevance, flexibility, and effectiveness of curricular in all domains of Higher Education. Benefits of increased efficiency, effectiveness, and agility for course planners and managers in all academic domains is anticipated. The paper summarizes the development of a mobile App to motivate such engagement in a collaborative curricular.	ecology;emergence;mobile app;relevance	Michael Vallance;Yasunori Sannomiya;Mark Evan Nelson	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-62743-4_14	curriculum;curriculum mapping;higher education;pedagogy;political science	HCI	-74.99179169418612	-36.5550135535711	61809

A massive open online course (MOOC) is a new model for education that delivers videotaped lectures and other course materials over the Internet for all interested persons around the globe to learn for free. Here we present our MOOC ‘‘Bioinformatics: Introduction and Methods,’’ which is the second bioinformatics MOOC in the world and one of the first batch of seven MOOCs from China. In the first two runs of this bilingual MOOC, more than 30,000 students with diverse backgrounds registered from 110 countries and regions. In this manuscript, we present the content design of the MOOC, the demographic profiles and learning patterns of the students, the requirement for English support, and feedback from on-campus students. We offer a few suggestions to other scientists who may be interested in creating a MOOC. We also remember the S* course, a successful open online bioinformatics course that ran from 2001 to 2007, long before the current wave of MOOCs. We believe that MOOC education has great potential to enhance global bioinformatics education.	bioinformatics;lectures;manuscripts;massive open online course;registration	Yang Ding;Meng Wang;Yao He;Adam Yongxin Ye;Xiaoxu Yang;Fenglin Liu;Yuqi Meng;Ge Gao;Liping Wei	2014		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003955	biology;computer science;bioinformatics;data science;multimedia;language;china	Web+IR	-73.15578933586904	-28.631637139706797	61889

As authors, editors and compilers create electronic documents, they must identify necessary features and components, consider what past projects in computer science and publishing suggest, select publishing and development platforms, and add functionality to these platforms. Conference proceedings-collections of papers and related materials prepared as a record-provide an interesting domain for studying electronic publishing, particularly interaction and the interplay of nontextual and textual materials. Conferences include many materials, such as color graphics, animations and presentations, frequently left out of printed proceedings for reasons of space, cost or inability to present dynamic media. At the same time, too few multimedia systems acknowledge the significant role of text. In developing proceedings for the summer institutes of the Dartmouth Institute for Advanced Graduate Studies, the Dartmouth Experimental Visualization Laboratory addressed the challenges and possibilities of electronic proceedings design. >		Samuel A.

Community participation by way of helping set the station agenda, airing of people's voices, and providing them with a local communication medium, is the defining feature of CR. But this philosophy has been hard to execute in practice because of logistical difficulties, with station staff not being able to reach out to a listenership-base spread across several hundreds of square kilometers. In today's context though, the high penetration of mobile phones has made it easier for listeners to participate in the running of radio stations, but the potential of telephony and radio integration has been exploited only minimally.  In this paper, we explore the use of PhonePeti, an automated answering machine system in a community radio station based in Gurgaon, India. Answering machines are one of several ways to bring together the radio and telephony mediums. We show that this alone has the potential to considerably improve community engagement, but it also opens up many interesting issues on usability. Through quantitative and content analysis of 758 calls from 411 callers over two iterations of PhonePeti, combined with telephonic interviews of several callers, we show that significant challenges arise in being able to explain the concept of an answering machine to people who have not been exposed to a similar system in the past. We then show, through call statistics, that PhonePeti has increased community engagement by enabling more listeners to reach the station. Finally, we show that an answering machine system can be used to collect useful information from the callers.	interactive voice response;iteration;logistics;mobile phone;radio broadcasting;usability	Zahir Koradia;Aaditeshwar Seth	2012		10.1145/2160673.2160708	simulation;content analysis;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-66.02736768745558	-27.248017475422504	62440

Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative research methodology using a case study approach was adopted. Documentary sources, a semi-structured questionnaire for the focus group, and interviews were the instruments used to collect data. While a homogeneous sampling of five staff in the digitisation/digital preservation unit was adopted for the focus group interview, only one top management staff member from the rank of Assistant Director of each of the selected three National Information Centres was interviewed. Findings – The National Bureau of Statistics and the National Library of Nigeria have digital preservation policies. However, the area of coverage of the available policies is not adequate enough to ensure the long-term preservation of digital information. Similarly, the study revealed that the lack of institutional support from the National Information Centres studied is one of the challenges in the implementation of the digital preservation policy. Practical implications – For any National Information Centre to ensure the accessibility and reuse of its digital information, it must have a digital preservation policy, without which the active management of digital information will be very challenging and can result in the loss of vital digital information of significant importance. Originality/value – There is currently no research work addressing issues on digital preservation policy with a particular focus on Nigeria. This paper therefore highlights shortcomings of the available digital preservation policy and proposes a national digital preservation policy that will chart a road map for effective digital preservation activities in any National Information Centre.	accessibility;case preservation;digital data;focus group;sampling (signal processing);semiconductor industry	Ezra Shiloba Gbaje;Zakari Mohammed	2013	The Electronic Library	10.1108/EL-01-2012-0011	digital library;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-73.59559746339363	-24.855588921384058	62449

This term however is more encompassing than that, as it relates to the divide between those who have access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) and those who don't. Due to the small screen size, and resulting small font size and low contrast supported by most mobile phones, the visually impaired community fall into this category of having little access to this popular ICT. This paper presents iCanSee, a SIM based application built on a Smart Card Web Server (SCWS), developed particularly for the visually impaired community. It provides a web-based front end to the four most frequently used text-based communication tools on a mobile phone: the phone book; SMS; MMS; and email. iCanSee allows users to create their own CSS profiles, supporting changes to: background and font colour (for contrast); and font size. As the CSS file is stored on the SIM rather than the handset itself, when the user upgrades to a new mobile handset, all their settings are transferred along with other personal information such as their address book.	cascading style sheets;display size;email;freedom of information laws by country;html;mobile phone;personally identifiable information;smart card;subscriber identity module;television;text-based (computing);web application;web server	Hannah Thinyane;Mamello Thinyane	2009	2009 ITU-T Kaleidoscope: Innovations for Digital Inclusions		engineering;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-67.74674576016044	-29.686262344362895	62523

A series of interviews were carried out on six History subject teachers which provide a detailed and succinct information on their understanding of digital libraries, their knowledge and use of the Internet and digital resources, their perception of the possible impact of digital resources on teaching and learning, the benefits teachers seen in digital resources and the problems they have in using them. It also offers important insights on History subject teachers’ perceptions of the initiative to develop a collaborative digital library for History projects, perception of its potential use, pointing out the conditions that facilitate its use in the classrooms. The paper also points out the relevance of digital libraries to the History curriculum which will make readers understand that using the technology is relevant to the teaching of all subjects.	digital library;internet;library (computing);relevance	Abdullah Abrizah;A.

This research investigates whether some previously identified capabilities, (intuitive cognitive style, problem solving, visualisation, and future vision) differ between IT architects of different skill levels. We found that while all IT architects reported as very skilled problem solvers, the more highly skilled IT architects approached problems in a different manner than the others. We also found that the higher skilled IT architects had a significantly longer view of their actions. These results are important for the education of aspiring IT architects and also the selection and development of existing ones.	problem solving;scientific visualization	Keith Frampton;James A.

Supporting data will be the links to the web sites I used to gather the information. These include, in most cases, the type of questions asked as well as the summary data common among many of the surveys.The major topics addressed will be:Where is the faculty now on the learning curve of information technology (IT) applications?

2a84ce3b887fffed5a27a8eaac435e943ddd36f7	possibilities and challenges of multimodal literacy practices in teaching and learning english as an additional language		Abstract#R##N##R##N#I review a decade of empirical research specifically addressing possibilities and challenges of multimodal literacy practices in learning and teaching English as an additional language, particularly for adolescent multilingual English language learners (ELLs). Given the lack of empirical research and discussions about multimodal literacy practices of ELLs, this review focuses on the issues of multimodal literacy practices of ELLs and their teachers. Thus, I look mainly at the promise and potential of engaging ELLs in multimodal literacy practices and potential tensions of implementing multimodal literacies into classroom practices. Findings of this review suggest more empirical research related to how ELLs consume, interpret, and produce multimodal texts as well as some implications for pedagogy.	multimodal interaction	Youngjoo Yi	2014	Language and Linguistics Compass	10.1111/lnc3.12076	computer science;multimedia;communication;pedagogy	NLP	-74.5489922042922	-36.7907027047146	63779

The aim was assess the benefits of game-based learning with respect to teachers’ main challenges: facilitating the discussion of curricular subjects and enabling learning through conceptual thinking and social interaction. An existing digital and tangible installation called MicroCulture, originally created by the authors to bridge history learning across museums and schools was re-contextualised and placed at the school’s disposal, in a three weeks study involving 15 pupils. Data was gathered unobtrusively, with qualitative methods. Through mediated play and teacher’s facilitation, children occasionally engaged in interactions leading to conceptual thinking, cooperation, and forms of role play. The authors present both problems and positive experiences the pupils and teachers had in playing at MicroCulture; the findings allowed us to outline guidelines for developing similar installations. KeyWORDS Autism, Digital Games Based Learning, Facilitation, History, Role Play INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION An increasing number of studies has been dedicated to the design and evaluation of digital technologies targeted at supporting children affected by autism spectrum disorders (ASD for short) (Aresti-Bartolome and Garcia-Zapirain 2014). Differently from previous studies, which focus on supporting children in developing their skills in literacy and social interaction (Ploog et al 2013), this paper discusses how technology can help teachers covering specific subjects, e.g. history. This particular study emerged from the interest expressed by a primary school teacher from Aadal school		Emanuela Marchetti;Andrea Valente	2016	IJGBL	10.4018/IJGBL.2016040103	psychology;simulation;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-73.97249474330907	-36.503940934150926	63826

These youngsters constitute a considerable social problem in Europe and the aim of the project is to find ways to recover the intrinsic motivation to learn and thereby improve the opportunities for participation. Key in this innovative strategy is selforganized learning, the learner in control of the learning process. The paper starts with an introduction on the challenge these dropouts pose to the society at large and the learning strategy developed to cope with this matter. The usage of media in the methodology is crucial and links to the concept of a user-configurable Personal Learning Environment (PLE). The main research issues are: can reAct change the attitude, what are the benefits and drawbacks of this self-organized learning approach and do the ICT tools support these processes. This paper covers the first half of the project and reflects on the first rather positive experiences.	social media	Pieter de Vries	2013	iJAC		cooperative learning;educational technology;error-driven learning;social learning;simulation;social media;computer science;knowledge management;experiential learning;learning sciences;active learning;action learning;management;world wide web;open learning;synchronous learning;pedagogy	HCI	-74.65145331448471	-37.03842797438474	63856

The College has a long tradition of innovative education in the arts, natural and social sciences, computer science, and mathematics. Thi E approach will support the development of versatile professionals for the evolving workplace. To develop this program, a team of STEAM faculty members examined existing literature on the development of creativity as well as multidisciplinary models in industry, business, and education. Through academic restructuring of traditional educational models, this curriculum will be at the forefront of engaging learners in team-based multidisciplinary problem solving through mentoring, learning communities, research projects, and partnerships with outside agencies. The program is a model for the education of scientists who will be able to create innovations in modern science and technology necessary to address the complex problems facing human society.	computer science;microsoft forefront;problem solving	Margaret E.

Computer users today are able to manage files and move from application to application without directly invoking a DOS command. Application packages such as word processors, spread sheets, and data bases provide for file management. Special software programs are available that allow the user to backup an entire hard disk without any knowledge of DOS. Menu programs can be placed on a hard disk which allow the user to choose applications without knowing DOS commands. Perhaps the most creative programs to help the user avoid DOS, are the DOS management systems available on the market today which allow the user to speak English while the program speaks DOS to the system. On some campuses personnel are available to install and set up computers with hard disks using menu programs, applications, and DOS management programs. The user is trained in using the application and shown how to work with the menu system. As long as the system does not have a hardware or software problem, the user is able to be productive without extensive training in DOS commands. This process saves a great deal of time and money in training the computer user. Emphasis can be placed on training programs in areas where there is direct return for the time and money spent. Certainly a case could be developed to support DOS training for all computer users. Knowledge of the operating system, file management, backup procedures, etc. could be a tremendous advantage for the user. However, management must weigh the expenditure of time and cost against the advantages of training a staff in MS-DOS. Furthermore, not all computer users will find DOS friendly and their attempt to use the DOS commands could become frustrating and time consuming.	backup;central processing unit;computer;dos;database;hard disk drive;ms-dos;user (computing)	William B.

It is intended for participants who recognize that conventional classroom design methodologies may not always work for online learning, especially when an instructor is not available to facilitate more independent learning. What changes do we need to make when we shift the responsibility for learning from the classroom instructor to the online learner? What are our new considerations and what changes do we need to make when we expect learners to become more-self motivated and self-directed online learners?	online and offline;online machine learning	Maggie Martinez	2002	Educational Technology & Society		educational technology;computer science;knowledge management;experiential learning;learning sciences;teaching and learning center;multimedia;synchronous learning;pedagogy	HCI	-75.22303040544921	-37.73096759829596	64368

These new learning approaches are very difficult to manage by using traditional management methods. This is one of the challenges in order to improve the new massive open online courses. In this paper, we propose a big data modelling approach, considering information from a big data analysis perspective, finding out which are the most relevant indicators in order to guarantee the success of the course. This novel approach is described along the paper using the case study of an open online course offered at our university. We describe the lessons learned in this work with the objective of providing general tools and indicators for other online courses. This will enhance the analysis and management of this kind of courses, contributing to their success.	data mining;massive open online course	Alejandro Maté;Elisa de Gregorio;José Cámara;Juan Trujillo;Sergio Luján-Mora	2016	Expert Systems	10.1111/exsy.12119	analytics;text mining;computer science;data science;data mining;business analytics;business intelligence;world wide web;semantic analytics	ML	-71.85695451695345	-32.34447955064944	64506

Thus for HLI to remain competitive globally, innovation is essential. Innovation is required not only in the business process to aid in more efficient ways of conducting the business, but also in the teaching and learning method. Due to the recent technology of Web 2.0 and 3.0, learners are exposed to vast amount of information in which it is made accessible online. In addition to the Internet capabilities in providing vast amount of information, learners are also exposed to the global communication in which platforms such as social networking software like Facebook, Twitter, MySpace had allowed learners to communicate with others across the globe in the quest of finding information and getting related knowledge. This provisions had posed a challenge to the academics in the HLI to innovate their way of teaching and ensure what is delivered to the learners are not repetitive to what they have known before through online information. As such teaching and learning must be co-created between the instructors and learners and be viewed from the participative and service oriented approach. The participative approach emphasizes on the learners participation in real life exercise while the service-oriented approach promotes values that are co-created between the learners and instructors to create win-win perspectives for both parties. Therefore this particular work is geared towards innovating the teaching and learning method across two countries, to provide an experience to the learners in terms of life exposure working with various community from the other countries and bring to light the experience in interacting with others, difference in work culture between two communities, sharing of ideas, working in different time zones and using technology in communicating and delivering results. The outcomes of the research is the participative model using a service oriented approach which can be used as a platform to innovate in current teaching learning process.	business process;interaction;real life;service-orientation;service-oriented device architecture;web 2.0	Yazrina Yahya;Doreen Nielsen;Muriati Mukhtar	2011	Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021663	engineering;knowledge management;multimedia;social network	ML	-76.26388819296884	-37.11796955883446	64665

Computer based solutions provide the technological support necessary for the whole teaching and learning process. The greatest advantage is the possible combination of all usable instruments, their flexibility and configurability. With new technologies and new media types it will be possible to support all kinds of training, self-study and continuing education in local or global networks over the web. It is clear that these new methods and technologies require new methods and solutions for the tasks content creation, delivery and archiving in education. Especially the use of new media sets high requirements on these tasks. This article describes how content management systems, a technology already used in other kinds of business, can support these tasks in web based education. After an introduction a definition of content management is given and refined for the area of web based education. Next the main building blocks and features of content management systems are described and the improvements for web based education are highlighted. Finally content management is embedded in the learning workflow.	archive;content management system;embedded system;global network;internet;new media;requirement	Thomas Kleinberger;Paul Müller	2000			web development;content inventory;web standards;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;internet presence management;computer engineering	Web+IR	-76.8091920991794	-36.43226467399689	64827

Developing a unique market niche to attract students and keep alumni affiliated is a constant struggle. As we build new electronic universities and add electronic courses and dimensions of existing colleges and universities, these same questions of uniqueness, attraction and affiliation will begin to crop up. This issue also has ramifications for basic education schools both public and state supported who are attempting to widen their image electronically. In this article, which is an exegetical and hermeneutical piece, the author hopes to pose some questions about culture and mission and make suggestions for extending these to the electronic environment.	cyberculture;niche blogging;online machine learning;population;reputation;web design	Michael W.

SRL of adult and lifelong learners is a well-researched area, though its application within distance education is a new area of investigation. Open and distance learning lean heavily on self-learning and self-learning resources, though interaction at designated learning centers and online learning platforms is occasionally offered. In China, there is still persistence of the age-old teacher-centric model of teaching-learning; and, within distance education offered largely by the radio and television universities, there is insistence for regular tuition classes at designated branch schools. At the backdrop of understanding and enhancing SRL of Chinese distance learners, the authors took up this research to find out the elements and levels of SRL ability among Chinese distance learners. Based on factor analysis (on 357 students for item analysis and on 600 distance learners for structural validity of the initial 117-item scale), a standardized 54-item Self-regulated Learning Ability Scale was finalized and administered on a random sample of 2738 undergraduate learners (1630 males and 1108 females) from the Open Distance Education Centre of Beijing Normal University, P.R. China, doing an online course during 2009–10. The sample came from either senior high school (grade 12) or junior college (grade 14). Data on four dimensions of SRL—planning, control, regulating and evaluation—were analyzed using ‘t’ test for variables of gender, level of education and age. Results indicated that all the participants had above-average levels of SRL in all the four dimensions of planning, control, regulating and evaluation. In so far as gender was concerned, male distance learners were better in SRL than female distance learners, especially in control (ie, content and resources) and all the evaluation dimensions. Though no age difference was found, students from junior colleges had better planning, regulating and evaluating abilities than those who came from senior high schools. These results have been discussed in the context of current changes in Chinese distance/online education and also in relation to the age-old Chinese culture of learning. The results will also have implications for designing distance and online learning generally.

The concept is defined, and six qualities of online communities are identified: members (user roles are clearly defined); mission (generally accepted goal-statement, ideas, beliefs, etc.); commitment (members give their loyalty to the mission); social interaction (frequent interaction between the members); mutually beneficial (participation is useful for individuals and other members); and location (an online meeting place). A table provides an overview of these qualities as they apply to study, social, knowledge, and e-commerce communities. Online knowledge communities are divided into corporate communities, communities of practice (i.e., work or profession-related communities), and social knowledge communities. In addition, four guidelines for the design of line knowledge communities are presented (i.e., the online knowledge community has to be functional, usable, sociable, and valuable). Two projects are described in which online knowledge communities are designed and implemented based on these guidelines: E-study Europe, a project focusing on an online knowledge community called E-study in an international university context; and StudyCom, an online knowledge community for secondary education in the Netherlands.

f5ead2e20c7f0b62e3b4a906d90798973073e9ab	learning about the past through situatedness, embodied exploration and digital augmentation of cultural heritage sites		Abstract The design of interactive experiences for archaeological sites entails the consideration of the particular characteristics and constraints of the exhibition space. Our aim is to address these challenges by exploring the potential of a recently emerging interaction paradigm called World-as-Support , which is based on projective Augmented Reality (AR). In this study, we present the design process of a virtual heritage experience for a bomb shelter built during the Spanish Civil War that currently belongs to the Barcelona History Museum. The goal of this study was twofold. First, we aimed to define the requirements for the design of a first prototype based on the World-as-Support interaction paradigm. Second, we carried out a study with a local school to evaluate the benefits of an educational experience based on this paradigm. Our results indicate benefits to complement the guided visit: (1) by using projective AR to explore different layers of the learning experience; and (2) by including collaborative activities based on embodied enactments to foster the understanding of historical contents that require emotional engagement and critical thinking.

57b201396b3d0f3ae04a180489f4ac79fdfaf49c	delivering labeled teaching images over the web		The Web provides educators with the best opportunity to date for distributing teaching images across the educational enterprise and within the clinical environment. Experience in the pre-Web era showed that labels and information linked to parts of the image are crucial to student learning. Standard Web technology does not enable the delivery of labeled images. We have developed an environment called OverLayer that succeeds in the authoring and delivering of such images in a variety of formats. OverLayer has a number of functional specifications, based on the literature and on our experience, among them, the following: Users should be able to find components by name or by image; to receive feedback about their choice to test themselves. The image should be of arbitrary size; should be reusable; should be linked to further information; should be stand-alone files. The labels should not obscure the image; should be linked to further information. Images should be stand-alone files that can be transferred among faculty members. Implemented in Java, OverLayer (http:/(/)omie.med.jhmi.edu/overlayer) has at its heart a set of object classes that have been reused in a number of applets for different teaching purposes and a file format for creating OverLayer images. We have created a 350-image histology library and a 500-image pathology library, and are working on a 400-image GI endoscopy library. We hope that the OverLayer suite of classes and implementations will help to further the gains made by previous image-based hyperlinked technologies.	applet;class;functional specification;hyperlink;java programming language;mdf attribute type - name;tracer;world wide web;format	Harold P.

Two independent studies on curricula integration indicated that parents' and teachers' preferred models as well as teachers' applied models vary widely. These models range from the technocentric (applying ICT as a discrete subject) to the humanistic curriculum (using ICT as a cross-curricular tool). The findings indicate that the challenge is on the policy makers to decide which model to adopt so as to specify the role of ICT in the National Curriculum and to create an appropriate infrastructure to support the model adopted.	centralisation	Yiasemina Karagiorgi;Kyriacos Charalambous	2004	Education and Information Technologies	10.1023/B:EAIT.0000024259.91951.44	mathematics education;information and communications technology;knowledge management;primary education;mathematics;law;pedagogy	HCI	-75.91389998335674	-33.91744117624374	66732

Yet many of these initiatives, such as out-of-school activities or innovative new computer science courses for secondary school students, may disproportionately attract students who already have prior interest and experience in computing. How, then, do we engage the silent majority of students who do not self-select computer science? This paper examines this question in the context of ENGAGE, an in-school outreach initiative for middle school students. ENGAGE's learning activities center on a game-based learning environment for computer science. Results reveal that the initiative improved the computer science attitudes of students who were not already predisposed to study computer science, in a way that a corresponding after-school program could not. The results illustrate how an in-school initiative can empower young students who might not otherwise consider studying computer science.	closing (morphology);computer science	Philip Sheridan Buffum;Megan Hardy Frankosky;Kristy Elizabeth Boyer;Eric N.

f59d3cf69db677e909d1a7da6b0c31cf9e9339da	learning to manage nextgen environments: do student controllers prefer to use datalink or voice?		The Next Generation Air Transportation (NextGen) system will introduce new automation tools to help air traffic controllers manage the projected increase in air traffic. As automation tools are gradually implemented, there will be a period of time where some air traffic will be managed with traditional voice-based tools and others will be managed with automation tools. The present study examined whether ATCo students prefer to use voice or Datalink more often to solve conflicts, and determine if there were any situations where Datalink was particularly beneficial to students. The present study is an archival analysis of data collected from 50 student ATCos who took part in one of four semesters of an ATCo training internship offered by the Center for Human Factors in Advanced Aeronautics Technologies (CHAAT). We found that students were more likely to use Datalink to resolve conflicts during the midterm than at the final, suggesting early reliance on tools during learning. However, at the final exam, students used voice and Datalink equally often, and indicated that they preferred voice over Datalink. The preference for voice is likely due to it being a more efficient method of controller-pilot communication than Datalink.

Several companies now sell tools such as “recommender systems,” which take input about users and products and generate recommendations about which products the users will like best. At their best, recommenders can be wonderful tools for users, helping them sort through myriad items they could read, buy, or watch to select those few that are most valuable to them. The algorithms that power these systems have evolved dramatically, and the best can produce rapid recommendations over data sets of millions of users and hundreds of thousands of products. The other edge of the sword is that recommender systems provide perfect tools for marketers and others to invade users’ privacy. After all, recommenders seek to learn everything about our preferences, including what we like to read, what we like to buy, how much money we spend, and what influences us to spend it. How a recommender deals with privacy decides whether its users view it as a boon or a bane. If the recommender only uses this information to help us find items to purchase on a Web site, we will probably value the feature — it might even bring us back to shop there again. On the other hand, if the Web site sells our information to other companies so they can more effectively bother us with phone calls at dinner time, we’ll probably feel our privacy has been invaded. Privacy is a critical issue for recommender systems. In the end, personalization is an important factor in developing effective Web sites because it creates a user experience that is both compelling and sticky. The experience is compelling because it helps users find exactly the information, products, and services they need. It is sticky because a personalized Web site trains itself over time to serve its users better, which makes those users less likely to go to a new site that they would have to train all over again.	algorithm;goto;list of minor characters in the matrix series;money;personalization;privacy;recommender system;sticky bit;user experience;world wide web	John Riedl	2001	IEEE Internet Computing	10.1109/4236.968828	computer science;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;recommender system	Web+IR	-63.96451030404736	-27.132703590886006	67067

Of particular interest is how refugees access, use and share information to support information needs which emerge during the resettlement process. Method. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in the language selected by the participant. Photo-voice technique was also employed and culminated in a focus group in which participants discussed the photos. The first phase of the qualitative analysis is reported in this paper. Analysis. Data from interviews, focus groups and images captured by photo-voice technique were coded thematically, focusing on the similarities and differences in perspective. Results.In the resettlement process refugees strive to regain a sense of place. Information is a critical resource for resettlement, but access to information and trust in that information pose challenges in moving from the liminal zone of marginality towards social integration. The digital environment threads through refugees’ information experiences and represents a significant social ground. Conclusions. Findings from the first phase of this study have provided us with new concepts and ways of describing the impacts of resettlement from an information perspective. It also affords an opportunity to consider how information resilience is shaped and emerges.		Annemaree Lloyd;Ola Pilerot;Frances Hultgren	2017	Inf. Res.

This article, using issues of censorship as particular examples, questions whether a focus on rights leads to a narrow idea of the library profession and its clients. It suggests that stressing the role of library professionals as teachers, as experts who instruct others on how to better achieve the projects that they have in mind, will lead to a richer and more realistic ethical conversation. INTRODUCTION People of a certain age remember when it was expected that a librarian might very well tell one that certain material was inappropriate for children of a certain age. One hoped, of course, that what was inappropriate about it was that it was naughty, and one therefore wanted more than ever to read what one was told was inappropriate. The librarian was seen as “one who exercises official or officious supervision over morals and conduct,” which isjust the Oxford English dictionary’s definition of a censor. There was information there that was wanted, and someone was making it difficult to attain. In reality, the librarian was probably more concerned with the fact that one was so ignorant that one could not possibly understand the material being requested. The librarian recognized that exposing someone to data might not provide that person with information. Modern technology Robert G. Wengert, Philosophy Department, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 105 Gregory Hall, 810 S. Wright Street, Urbana, IL 61801 LIBRARY TRENDS, Vol. 49, No. 3, Winter 2001, pp. 486-509 02001 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois WENGERT/SOME ETHICAL ASPECTS 487 has merely accentuated this contrast between data and information, providing a perfect arena for professionals with a librarian’s skills. It has also made their role in forming, disseminating and, sometimes, restricting that information more central than ever. The Internet drives home the need for someone knowledgeable who can locate, review, and organize all the material that is constantly engulfing users in ever accelerating waves. There is so much material, much of it garbage, and few have either the competence or the time to carefully review the accuracy or quality of what can be found by clicking a few times in a browser or typing in a few related words prefaced by mystical “t”signs in one’s favorite search engine. It is always a relief to find a coherently organized page that enables one to quickly focus on just the answer to the question that one had. That sort of organization turns the swirl of data into something useable-i.e., into information. On reflection, one realizes that libraries and librarians have always done this for their patrons. They brought together the reference books, the texts, the journals that they thought would most effectively provide answers to the questions that were likely to be asked. They also gathered items that they thought patrons would enjoy. The difference was that most users never saw them making those decisions, never saw the maelstrom of wildly inaccurate reference books, idiotic texts, or simple trash that the librarians decided would waste space that could be put to better use. At present, all users face, on their desktops, this welter of information; people are brutally familiar with the riot of data available to them. This awareness makes them more appreciative of the need to turn these data into useable information. A PROPOSED OF INFORMATION EFINITION Barwise and Seligman (1997) investigate the very possibility of one thing carrylng information about another. They stress that there is nothing particularly modern or new about information: Once one reflects on the idea of information flowing, it can be seen to flow everywhere-notjust in computers and along telephone wires but in every human gesture and fluctuation of the natural world. Information flow is necessary for life. It guides every action, molds every thought, and sustains the many complex interactions that make up any natural system or social organization. Clouds carry information about forthcoming storms; a scent on the breeze carries information to the predator about the location of prey; the rings of a tree carry information about its age; a line outside the gas station carries information about measures in the national budget; images on a television screen in Taiwan can carry information about simultaneous events in Britain; the light from a star carries information about the chemical composition of gases on the other side of the universe; and the resigned shrug of a loved one may carry information about a mental state that could not be conveyed in words. 488 LIBRARY TRENDS/WINTER 2001 With this perspective, the current revolution appears to be primarily technological, with people discovering new and more efficient ways to transform and transmit information. Information is and always was all around us, saturating the universe; now there are new ways of mining the raw material, generating new products, and shipping them to increasingly hungry markets. (p. 4) Their investigation notes critical features of information that are sometimes overlooked: There are no completely safe ways of talking about information. The metaphor of information flowing is often misleading when applied to specific items of information even if the general picture is usefully evocative of movement in space and time. The metaphor of information content is even worse, suggesting as it does that the information is somehow intrinsically contained in the source and so is equally informative to everyone and in every context. (p. 12) In recognition of the last point, that information is not like light, which equally illuminates everything it touches, but depends integrally on the receiver, one of their preliminary definitions becomes: To a person with prior knowledge k, r being Fcarries the information that s is G if in every state compatible with kin which ris F, s is G (and there is at least one state compatible with k in which s is not G).

80a022ffb851c38531f38b822699bca7f4743726	supporting community inquiry with digital resources		Today there are a number of fields that address the need to develop better means of employing information and communication technologies (ICTs) to help communities achieve their goals. Digital infrastructure and repositories are widely created to support the activities of educational, workplace, and scientific communities, as well as virtual communities of interest that may center on topics as diverse as entertainment, crisis management, and health. However, the research and development of ICTs faces numerous challenges. Community inquiry theory can help address some of these challenges. The Inquiry Page project supports a set of ICTs that have been developed by a community of inquiry in order to support communities of inquiry. The paper presents the theory of community inquiry and illustrates how inquiry theory can influence the research and development of ICTs and their adoption and use within real communities.

Contrary to many people’s assumptions, the Socratic dialogues show no evidence of discoverybased learning, nor are they even examples of good questioning technique. Those who work with hypertext need to give deep thought to what it means to discover while being told. It was a joy to read Jacobs’ (1992) account of the wisdom from the past. It raises the age-old question: why no change? The educational revolutions of this century, so often jump-started by each ‘new’ technology, have had no visible enduring success in changing schooling procedures. We need to ask why: is it ( a ) because the basic concepts in the wisdom of the ancients are so ill-defined? Or (b) is the ideal unattainable because of human incompetence or intransigence? Or are (a) and (b) both true? I can remember when programmed instruction was compared favourably with Socratic dialogue in the early 1960s. Skinner, a professor with many years of lecture-giving experience, was concurrently a master shaper of nonverbal animals; he could, without a word of ‘instruction’ persuade a pigeon to turn a figure 8 or play a tune on a piano. Shaping, I suggest, is quintessentially a guided discovery procedure-the animal must figure out the contingencies without professorial lectures, given only the opportunity to behave, to try, to receive feedback. The ‘shapee’ in the laboratory does not choose what will succeed any more than the 2year-old can command nature to cause a lopsided tower of blocks to stand. Both must discover the way the environment works by interacting with it. This was the behaviourist model, what they said they were trying to do. However, in spite of their animal training experience, early Skinnerian programmers (including Skinner) reverted to the lecture podium and told everything, leaving nothing to discovery. How differently would Socrates ‘teach’ in defence of discovery? He may ‘extol1 the Unchaining the slaves 223 advantages of discovery-based learning’ but could he do it? I see no evidence. Socrates, as an instructor of the slave boy, was the archetypal professor. Like all good teachers, he talked a lot, but he also believed in asking ‘questions’ of the learner to check comprehension (or was it to show that the child already knew it?). We still ask ‘Do you understand?’ and ‘Is that clear?’. Infrequently, learners have the gall to say no, as did the slave boy once (according to the translation of Meno referred to below). More often, learners have trouble knowing whether and what they understand. Lost to the recognition it deserves is an intriguing little experiment by Ira Cohen in 1962. Cohen translated the Socratic dialogue ‘step by step’ into 16 ‘frames’ accompanied by the diagram Socrates was assumed to have drawn in the sand, omitting only a question that the slave boy balked at. Here are the first steps.	deep thought (chess computer);diagram;emoticon;hypertext;interaction;noise shaping;podium;programmer;turned a	Susan M.

0d865cec28f31e20769741cf5cec8017d179e8ab	"""creating streaming video """"learning objects"""" for an online course"""		For a graduate-level online course, we created a series of CIO (Chief Information Officer) roundtables, discussing current issues with three senior IT executives. Starting with a vague vision of videotaping a conversation with the subjects, our project evolved into a full-blown enterprise with broadcast-level production values. We learned valuable lessons about justifying and designing such a project, the technical and mechanical aspects of taping and post-production work, and plans for deploying and using the learning objects. The amount of work required was far more than we anticipated, but positive student response indicated that it was a worthwhile endeavor. While it may be difficult to justify this level of effort in all cases, we believe that the project generated a number of ideas to consider when planning a project of this type.		Alan D.

However, children’s librarians plan, deliver, and reflect on storytimes in implicit ways that seem to align with design principles. Drawing on empirical data from the VIEWS2 study, this poster explores the premise that design principles implicitly inform the creation of these library programs for young children. Comparing models of storytime production and models of design reveals that key design principles—especially iteration and reflection—are present throughout storytime production. The reciprocal and influential nature of these design concepts combined with the model of storytime production lead to a new model of storytime design, with implications for library research, practice, and pedagogy as well as models of design.	align (company);iteration;librarian;natural language understanding	J.

It is rather a way of teaching that tries to support the learning and memory process in all phases from lesson design over input and practice up to the transfer of knowledge and competencies in real situations. The proposals for brain-based teaching come from neurodidactics or educational neuroscience that combines findings of brain and memory research, didactics, pedagogy and psychology. This paper aims at presenting concepts and methods that can facilitate learning and proposals for designing computer science lessons by considering the functioning of the brain and the memory.	computer science	Barbara Sabitzer;Stefan Pasterk;Sabrina M.

0141fa9dd25f5a5d219807efa3440f52e349eeeb	investigating knowledge structures in computer science education		To be knowledgeable in a subject matter is a prerequisite of being competent. Experts typically possess densely connected structural knowledge of the concepts in their field of expertise. Therefore, investigating the knowledge structures of learners remains a central aspect of educational research in computer science as well as in other subjects, despite the ongoing trend towards outcome and competence oriented assessment. This thesis presents concept landscapes a novel way of investigating the state and development of knowledge structures using concept maps. Instead of focusing on the assessment and evaluation of single maps, the data of many persons is aggregated and data mining approaches are used in analysis. New insights into the “shared” knowledge of groups of learners are possible in this way. The educational theories underlying the approach, the definition of concept landscapes, and the accompanying analysis methods are presented. Since both data mining techniques and concept map collection are well suited for computer-based approaches, three software projects have been realized in the course of this thesis. They allow computer-based drawing and assessing concept maps, the subsequent analysis of concept maps and concept landscapes, and the extraction of salient concepts and propositions from texts. The methods and tools have been applied in three research projects that investigate structural knowledge in computer science education. Among others, the structural knowledge of CS students entering university has been analyzed. It has been found, that attending the compulsory school subject “Informatics” in Bavaria has visible effects on the knowledge structures of beginning students. The results of these studies can be taken in order to better understand the possibilities, limits, and effects of teaching methods, curricula, or learning materials in computer science education and other subjects.	computer science;concept map;data mining;informatics;subject matter expert turing test;teaching method;theory	Andreas Michael Mühling	2014			concept map;data science;informatics;mathematics education;computer science	AI	-75.20451265086305	-35.126008378475944	69841

These changes require a clear vision and plan to support educators through the transition. In this session, we will present findings from the first year evaluation of a one-to-one student laptop initiative in a large urban district in the United States that illustrates the impact of vision and planning on efforts to support changes in teacher practice, classroom culture, and student engagement. We will share how the evaluation has informed practice within the district to help move towards a more personalized professional learning approach designed to leverage the power of technology. We will share strategies and recommendations for how to better support district and school leaders using technology to enhance teaching and learning.	laptop;one-to-one (data model);personalization	Kathryn Martin;David Miyashiro;Tim Baird	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-25684-9_2	mathematics education;knowledge management;political science;pedagogy	HCI	-75.32553345795537	-34.92860638178222	70280

However, the concept of narrative is still fuzzy and open to interpretations, due to its use and meaning in different disciplines and approaches. In order to deepen the knowledge of narrative use in design, this paper presents three categorizations that survey the what, where and why of narratives in design, respectively. First, it discusses five definitions of narratives based on narrative theory. Secondly, it proposes a typology that classifies the occurrences of narratives in design. Thirdly, it analyses the roles and functions of narratives in designed products and the design process. Finally, using the proposed categorizations, it shows strategies for a narrative approach to design richer experiences for products and discusses techniques for the design process. To conclude, future developments of the project are described, including a call for design projects that involve narratives to be included in a database.	biological anthropology;categorization;database;experience	Silvia Grimaldi;Steven Fokkinga;Ioana Ocnarescu	2013		10.1145/2513506.2513528	narrative inquiry;narratology;narrative criticism;design process;experience design;engineering;knowledge management;management science;narrative;communication	HCI	-64.0158511081504	-36.93161739092376	70370

He redefined the IT user experience , creating products and services loved by millions around the world. He reshaped not only the IT industr y but others as well—the music industry with the iPod; the cell phone industry with the iPhone; the movie industry with his Pixar Animation Studios films; and the computing industry with the original Mac, the Mac OS X, and the iPad. He had also started to transform the publishing industry with his iBooks and media subscription services and the software industry with his App Store. His legacy will be felt for years to come. Jobs persuaded millions of people to try technology they'd never before considered. He went against mainstream thinking and followed his intuition and instinct. He could not only see what the future of technology could—and should—be, he could also bring that vision to fruition. As Georges van Hoegaerden wrote: """" He reinvented the business of technology innovation with a passion and an authentic desire to bring it to everyday people everywhere. He did it with the vigor required to keep his many young and cocky technologists in line and focused, and to achieve meaningful innovation that improved all of our lives. """" 1 He was """" brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it, """" said US President Barrack Obama in his tribute.

He caused """" creative destruction """" of old norms and business models through his blended understanding of technology and society, business and economics, and markets and corporate power. 2 He created a new ecosystem that integrates the devices that his company sells with applications and services, driving other companies to follow suit. Is it possible to emulate Jobs's success? W hat sort of values and practices would IT professionals and executives have to encompass? According to Jobs, """" Technology alone is not enough.

This paper presents results of a survey regarding information literacy, carried out on undergraduate students of the Department of Information and Communication Sciences at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb. Previous surveys had asserted the need to include information literacy or information competencies, differentiated from already present tool literacy or technological competencies, in students' curricula on the University. The aim of this survey was to analyse the students' information competencies as well as examine the students' attitude towards introducing an undergraduate course, during which they would learn how to efficiently search for information in the electronic environment while preparing seminar papers and exams. Furthermore, to gain an insight into the students' information retrieval accuracy in course-related research, the authors of this paper shall evaluate their information behaviour, i.e. investigate whether the students develop an overall research plan or search in relevant information sources, e.g. peer-reviewed databases etc. The research results can be helpful to determine the importance of information awareness at this level of education.	database;information literacy;information retrieval	M.

We spent six months creating a pilot version of an interactive digital platform that would allow learners to share their experiences with the disease. The platform, called Sura ya UKIMWI (The Face of AIDS), was designed by a team consisting of secondary school children, university counseling students, HIV counseling experts and experts in ICT. We took the case study approach and report on observations and experiences with the participatory design (PD) process and its outcomes, in this specific context. The results of the project indicate that the technology created under the PD paradigm helps students to easily compose their own stories thereby supporting their understanding and reflection on how these stories relate to their own life experiences. Interacting with the stories was entertaining to the students and they could identify the lessons to be learned. The approach can be an alternative to past attempts that mostly imported technology for HIV and AIDS education. Our experience can be used as a guide in establishing similar digital projects in other parts of the HIV and AIDS affected world.	experience;interaction;programming paradigm;yet another	Marcus Duveskog;Kati Kemppainen;Roman Bednarik;Erkki Sutinen	2009		10.1145/1551788.1551794	simulation;engineering;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-73.11976281237739	-35.86553405076847	70685

Resulting from this change, the effective management of how to keep contact with customers throughout different channels is one of the key success factors in today’s business world. Company Web sites have evolved in many industries into an extremely important channel through which customers can be attracted and retained. To analyze and optimize this channel, accurate models of how customers browse through the Web site and what information within the site they repeatedly view are crucial. Typically, data mining techniques are used for this purpose. However, there already exist numerous models developed in marketing research for traditional channels which could also prove valuable to understanding this new channel. In this paper we propose the application of an extension of the Logarithmic Series Distribution (LSD) model repeat-usage of Web-based information and thus to analyze and optimize a Web Site’s capability to support one goal of CRM, to retain customers. As an example, we use the university’s blended learning web portal with over a thousand learning resources to demonstrate how the model can be used to evaluate and improve the Web site’s effectiveness.	browsing;customer relationship management;data mining;optimizing compiler;world wide web	Michael Hahsler	2005	CoRR		market research;web analytics;blended learning;computer science;knowledge management;web intelligence;customer retention;world wide web	ML	-64.23467656953267	-27.284868919343413	70813
6f5c31bad9512f8cf8e95d7854925fc15bdd6205	institutional integration of an ict in education solution in a brazilian university		The present work shows the changes that have been happening in the learning process, where the relation professor/student stops being hierarchized vertically as it used to be in the past, where the professor spoke ex cathedra; focusing on the aptitudes that the students should be capable of acquiring, so that the professor becomes a guide in charge of conducting the student through the appropriate ways amid the big entanglement of asystematic information supplied by the so-called Information Society. Thus, the appropriate use of the new technologies has capital importance in the learning process. It is in this context that PUCPR developed the system called EUREKA, which has been improved each day, with the intention of providing its professors and students, among which the law course is included, an instrument capable to decisively contribute to the attainment of that new teaching paradigm. In order to achieve that, the mere adhesion of the learning process participants to the system is not enough, as this phase has already been achieved by PUCPR; above all it is important to have an appropriate and efficient use, what demands training and continuous formation of professors, being that the current challenge of the institution, especially in the case of the Law School, where the professors have predominantly been using the traditional methods of teaching, underutilizing the technological instruments that are already available.	programming paradigm;quantum entanglement;virtual community	José Renato Gaziero Cella;Claude René Tarrit	2011	European Journal of Law and Technology		mathematics education;engineering;management;pedagogy	HCI	-75.11445348837766	-31.188073490778798	70820
90690c434c2531ab2e5134ad594b92763d784292	the importance of a proactive approach to education at an educational/academic computer center	curriculum development;user needs;personal computer;conceptual framework;computer literacy;accounting education;social science;teaching methods	A growing responsibility of academic computer centers is to provide seminars on computer-related topics to the faculty, staff and students they serve. The curricular aim is to instruct users on the effective use of the computer as a tool which is specific to users' needs. To successfully achieve this aim, I recommend that computer centers adopt a proactive instructional approach. Adopting a proactive instructional approach requires that computer centers acknowledge their educational responsibility and take action for managing instructional time. It used to be that computer users were almost exclusively math, science or computer majors. At that time computer centers were called upon only occasionally to give a seminar, with the advent of new hardware or software. The user population of the eighties, however has dramatically changed; computer users are increasingly from business, the social sciences, and humanities. These so-called “end users” are more naive about computers and depend heavily on the computer center staff for basic and applied computer information and operations. Initially, the educational response from computer centers was to provide 1) “user-English” documentation and 2) “user-English” consultants in order to more quickly orient students to computers and to their specific applications. As the number of users rapidly increased, the interaction time between students and consultants became more constrained and pressured, and the priority soon became how quickly users could be moved in and out of the consultant's office. Certain dilemmas became endemic. For example, a student's offhand query, “I have a quick question…,” often required a more extensive answer than the student expected. The consultant was then faced with providing the apparently “immediate” answer to the question, if that was possible, or whether and to what extent, to provide a more in-depth answer, if time allowed. Also, as students' needs diversified, consultants had to be proficient in more applications. It became clear that a more efficient way to handle user needs was to work with groups, rather than, individuals. Thus, instructional computer seminars were a practical response to the growing demands made on computer center staff. While seminars were in fact accommodating, their curriculum development tended to be somewhat frenzied; and quickly assembled to respond to more urgent needs. Rather than providing structured curricula in computer skills, seminars were designed to deflect “quick questions.” Part of the problem was that the seminars were put together by individuals who were unable to take into account educational factors necessary in building a sound curriculum accompanied by appropriate teaching methods. Addressing problems as they arise is a direct response, but a reactive educational approach. A proactive approach tries to address problems in the context of providing users with 1) a conceptual framework and 2) training in specific applications. The conceptual and functional aspects are complementary components and can be weighted according to the educational objectives of the computer center. For example, seminars teaching computer literacy take, by definition, a more functional approach. However, making a person computer literate does not mean that the person is computer knowledgeable. Developing an overall approach for a computer center is difficult. Computer centers exist in tandem with academic and service departments and may need to be careful not to step on toes. Therefore, taking a proactive approach requires computer centers to make decision regarding responsibilities in stating and realizing educational goals. It is my view that user services must accept those responsibilities.	computer science;documentation;functional approach;proactive parallel suite;structured programming;teaching method;user (computing)	Sheri L.

These ideas were, at that time, novel and revolutionary. Some people regarded these ideas as dangerous; for example, the Swedish Data Inspection Board (Datainspektionen) forbade people from storing email messages for longer than one month as well as from discussing political and religious issues using computerized forum systems. Although people tried hard to implement systems and had some limited success, the ideas became successful with the public usage of the internet in the 1990s. Many had hoped to realize this much earlier.	best, worst and average case;catastrophe theory;computer;computer-mediated communication;email;geographical distance;humans;information exchange;internet;nonlinear gameplay;usability	Jacob Palme	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-23315-9_30	human–computer interaction;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-66.68972542929754	-27.414405939281757	70949

As the role of educational multimedia increases, it is increasingly important to have an idea of the potential it affords for teaching and learning. This Briefing reports on the PEDACTICE project which considers teachers' experience and assessments of multimedia, its impact on their teaching and on pupils' learning and how the use of multimedia in education can be effectively supported. ä Government policy on the National Grid for Learning is driving the uptake and use of multimedia and internet in schools. The use of CD-ROM and the internet is becoming an integral part of the curriculum in all areas. ä The introduction of multimedia into the classroom has a profound impact on teachers' role and on students' learning and motivation. ä The current management and resourcing of ICTs does not allow teachers using multimedia to exploit the full potential of the technology in their teaching. ä Research suggests that teachers are keen to integrate ICTs into teaching and learning but find it difficult to know what to select from the array of available products. There is a perception that multimedia products sometimes do not function as described by manufacturers. ä Teachers need information on the capabilities of multimedia packages and their suitability for classes. PEDACTICE is developing a database for this purpose in partnership with teachers. ä Support by other teachers with an expertise in ICT is vital to the uptake of multimedia in schools but being used as an ICT expert adds another task onto already overworked teachers.	cd-rom;floor and ceiling functions;internet	Katja van den Brink;Reinhold S.

Through an experimental design, this research examines the role that empathy and related psychological constructs may play in the experiences of designers working at a distance. Findings show that in fact empathy does matter, and may affect both the enjoyment of the experience and the efficiency with which the designers work. This study shows a link between empathy and empathic constructs, and the outcomes of computer mediated distance design collaborations.	computer-supported cooperative work;design of experiments;experience	Amanda Rotondo	2010		10.1145/1880071.1880126	design;simulation;knowledge management;simulation theory of empathy;management;social psychology;collaboration	HCI	-63.49812012544581	-34.69009493414944	71277

Aiming at a higher level of internationalization and having in mind that students could gain from an intensive and multicultural experience ISEP organized its first Engineering for Sustainable Development (E4SD) Summer Course, in July 2014. With a set of modules taught by experienced teachers in different topics of sustainability, the course had a problem based learning (PBL) approach and was organized in a very informal model. A total of 8 Korean and 8 Portuguese students from different areas of scientific knowledge attended this course and could interact and develop ties with each other and the teachers involved in the course, while learning and applying the fundamental skills on sustainability. In what concerns the approach used by students from different countries to solve the sustainability problem that was launched for discussion (The Rehabilitation of Historic Cities - The Case of Porto UNESCO World Heritage Site: A Sustainable Development Challenge) it was noticed a clear difference between the two cultures. Whereas the young Korean students did not seem to care with the heritage behind a building or an historic city, the Portuguese students, used to live in a historic city, proposed a much more conservative approach. However, both the students could interact and understand the other side of the problem, reaching a consensual proposal. Finally the Korean students came to the conclusion that it was of interest to preserve Porto history. The fact that Korea is a very different country and that Korean culture is significantly different from the European one, could have triggered cultural issues. Nevertheless, the young generations are prone to change and adaptation to new situations, what allows for the resolution of any possible conflict. The PBL approach allowed for a more dynamic and informal learning environment. This revealed attractive for the young Korean students who were gaining different skills in this Summer Course as a prize for their good results in their formal learning courses. On the other hand, for the Portuguese teachers the E4SD Summer Course represented an opportunity to interact with a larger group of students with the same different culture, which is different from interacting with only one or two students coming from Europe under Erasmus mobility, in a very short and intensive contact period.	interaction;internationalization and localization	Nídia Caetano;João Rocha;José Carlos Quadrado;José Cardoso;Manuel C.

But is the design studio approach feasible in distance education? In most face-to-face teaching, studios are small (in terms of student numbers), reliant on a shared physical space, and intensive. For distance education the questions are: can we create an effective shared space online, and does it scale? Peter Lloyd and colleagues at the Open University (OU) in the U.K. have demonstrated that we can achieve both, with their Open Design Studio, which has been used by some 500 students per presentation of the course ‘Design thinking: creativity for the 21st century (U101)’ [3].

The DFFS offers a tablet-based digital learning environment for farmers and extension agents for knowledge sharing and knowledge co-creation. It provides an alternative to conventional agricultural extension training and monitoring. The prototype DFFS applies Farmer Field School (FFS) learning principles and is designed and developed following user experience (UX) design principles and user interface (UI) design principles from a responsible innovation perspective, using existing FFS material and tailored films which support and enrich the content. The prototype DFFS has been tested in Sierra Leone to assess its success in providing a substitute for face-to-face voluntary sustainability standard certification training for cocoa farmers. Results show that the DFFS as an off-line, telephonically connected and regular on-line updated learning platform offers an appropriate environment in which collective and individual learning is stimulated and facilitated. The DFFS prototype was socio-culturally and technologically appropriate and fitted the operational and strategic communication skills of cocoa farmers and other value chain stakeholders. Films capturing the testing are available as additional learning media.	cocoa (digital humanities)	Loes Witteveen;Rico Lie;Margriet Goris;Verina Ingram	2017	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.013	marketing;farmer field school;computer science;digital learning;principles of learning;user experience design;certification;agricultural extension;knowledge sharing;virtual learning environment;knowledge management	HCI	-76.03763407399008	-37.38229112047018	71768

A number of researchers have studied the effectiveness of college websites, however, most of these studies focused on the needs of students. There is a research gap in understanding the information needs of multiple audiences of college websites.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#This paper presents the preliminary findings of the study on information needs of multiple user groups of a community college website: traditional students, non-traditional students, employees, parents, and prospective students. The preliminary analysis of data shows that in general, community college website users need course-related information, information about the college, financial information, contact information, admission and career-related information pertaining to the college. On the other hand, each group of users has distinct information needs that should be taken into account in the architecture, design, and content of community college websites to make them more effective.	ecology;information needs	Borchuluun Yadamsuren;Anindita Paul;Jiazhen Wang;Xin Wang;Sanda Erdelez	2008		10.1002/meet.2008.14504503112	information needs;computer science;multimedia;world wide web;information architecture	HCI	-74.12092119751404	-26.83207196966865	71770

A meta-ethnography approach was utilized to locate, critically appraise, and synthesize the results of these studies. Based on an extensive search in the Web of Science, 19 articles were included in this synthesis. The results were divided into two parts: (1) key themes explicitly related to the preparation of pre-service teachers (e.g., using teacher educators as role models, learning technology by design, scaffolding authentic technology experiences), and (2) conditions necessary at the institutional level (e.g., technology planning and leadership, co-operation within and between institutions, training staff). To present how these key themes related to each other, an overarching model was developed. By interpreting the results of the review, recommendations were discussed for pre-service teacher technology training and future research.

2f969eb30e216356a245e3ad426a00b46e7e8696	improving the quality of technical and vocational education in slovakia for european labour market needs		Technical and vocational education and training (TVET) makes a significant contribution to economic competitiveness and welfare in a global knowledge-based economy. The main challenge for vocational education and training is to meet the changing skills needs of individuals and the world of work in accordance with the principle of lifelong learning. Since the demand for new skilled workers is increasing, and the TVET customer base is constantly diversifying, it is necessary to increase awareness of the key role played by education and training in economic competitiveness and social inclusion. As in other EU countries, quality assurance in Slovakia plays a decisive role in modernising education and training systems and in improving their performance and attractiveness. These objectives are widely shared by the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic. Education and training systems are being modernised and transformed in terms of more effective management systems and quality assurance. The paper responds to current situation and deficiencies in the educational system of technical and vocational secondary schools in Slovakia in training of qualified workforce for the local and global labour markets. Authors introduces the project Model for improving the quality of graduates and job applicants in the European labour market elaborated and submitted by the two Slovak institutions of higher education - Dubnica Institute of Technology in Dubnica nad Vahom and the University of SS. Cyril and Methodius in Trnava, Slovakia. Both institutions are characterized by an experienced staff in the field of educational research. The project aims to the development of a model for improving the quality of graduates and job applicants in European labour market. It focuses on graduates of secondary vocational schools in Slovakia and the acquisition and improvement of their key competences. The pilot stage of the Project deals with theoretical background of quality assurance and specifics of its application in the area of technical and vocational education. In further stage, the project deals with a model for improving the quality of graduates and job applicants, in particular by the application of the elements of the foreign language communication skills improvement, increasing the computer literacy and enhancing the quality of teaching technical and vocational subjects of the target group. The importance of clear concise communication is often overlooked by the typical engineer and scientist. Based on the research findings, the paper emphasises the importance of communication skills in training students for technical and engineering professions. The author provides research findings in analysis of the most common mistakes in preparing PowerPoint slides, and in giving oral presentations. He shows practical outcomes and methodology for proper communication training. The published findings would help teachers of engineering and science subjects to find the way to implement communication and presentation skills into technical subjects, as well as to increase efficiency of their technical presentations in educational process.

46c0d201cd191bb69a894b75e00d4c3e6b96ed54	the role of the user services representative in an academic computing environment	distribution center;communication channels	Many frustrations confront users in an academic computing environment. One of the strongest is felt when users try to communicate effectively with the computing center's staff. At the Kansas University Academic Computer Center, we have created the position of User Services Representative (USR) to ameliorate this problem. Among other responsibilities, this person functions as an ombudsman, and provides users with an “open door” to the services and facilities of the Computing Center. Although this person is not actually classified as a consultant, s/he coordinates this activity, and tries to match up special consulting needs with the most appropriate staff member. Additionally, the User Services Representative handles telephone consulting and acts as a distribution center for questions and problems of great diversity. This helps facilitate greater intra-staff communication too, which can be a real problem with a staff of 50-75 people. In the 15 months since this position was initiated many improvements have been noticed in user assistance services, including shorter waiting lines for consulting and more effective dedicated consulting sessions. This paper will detail the activities of the User Services Representative and show how the position helps to improve communication channels in an academic computing environment.	chemical database;documentation	John E.

Based on a general discussion of the concept interdisciplinarity and a summary of the discussion in the field two empirical methods from scientometrics are introduced and applied. Science overlay maps and the Rao-Stirling-Diversity index are used to analyze the TEL field with a scientometric analysis. The science overlay maps show that a wide variety of disciplines contribute to research in the field. The analysis reveals that the field has been operating on a relatively high level of crossdisciplinarity in the last 10 years compared to 6 other fields of reference. Only in 2004 a decrease in the level of crossdisciplinarity could be identified. Introduction Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) has always been recognized as an interdisciplinary research field rooted in several academic disciplines like educational science, psychology/cognitive science and computer science. While the topic of interdisciplinarity has been recently discussed more intensively in the field (Sutherland, Eagle, & Joubert, 2012; Carmichael, 2011; Conole, Scanlon, & Mundin, 2010) there is very little work about how the interdisciplinarity of Technology-Enhanced Learning can be empirically assessed and compared to other fields of reference. In this paper we discuss the theoretical foundations of interdisciplinarity and summarize the discussion within the TEL community. To operationalize the concept of interdisciplinarity we present methods by which interdisciplinarity can be empirically measured. We apply science-overlay maps and the Rao-Stirling diversity measurement to provide an empirical basis for the future discussion about interdisciplinary of Technology-Enhanced Learning and compare the interdisciplinarity to other exemplary fields. The paper is structured as follows. In the next section we summarize the discussion about interdisciplinarity in general and then specifically for the field of TEL and we summarize different approaches to measure interdisciplinarity. In section 3 we provide an overview about the approach we have followed. Section 4 presents our results and in the final section we discuss our findings and limitations of the approach. Theoretical Background Modes of Interdisciplinarity The ongoing debate about the contribution of science to the grand challenges of our time constantly leads to a criticism about the disciplinarity structure of science. We define a scientific discipline with Aram (2004) as “thought domains – quasi-stable, partially integrated, semi-autonomous intellectual conveniences – consisting of problems, theories, and methods of investigation”. Gibbons et al. (1997) have published a prominent contribution to the discussion about disciplines and interdisciplinarity. The authors describe two different modes of knowledge production by the sciences. Mode 1 depicts the classical way of knowledge production in scientific disciplines. Knowledge is produced without taking into account its application context and the value of the knowledge is only assessed in an academic context. This context mostly consists of a specific academic discipline. In contrast mode 2 stands for the opening of science and has the following distinct features: Context of application, transdisciplinarity, heterogeneity, reflexivity/social accountability and novel quality control (Hessels & van Lente, 2008). Knowledge in Mode 2 is always produced within the context of application: “Such knowledge is intended to be useful to someone whether in industry or government, or society more generally and this imperative is present from the beginning” (Gibbons et al., 1997). For this paper the most important feature of Mode 2 is the aspect of transdisciplinarity. In this paper we build on earlier definitions of interdisciplinarity, crossdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity as defined by Wagner et al. (2011). Table 1: Working definition of transdisciplinarity, crossdisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity as defined by Wagner at al. (2011) Transdisciplinarity Cooperation between scientists and practitioners Crossdisciplinarity Any form of scientific cooperation between scientific disciplines without any further explication of shared methods, goals and mutual interest Interdisciplinarity Collaboration where various disciplines, keeping their own autonomy (i.e. without becoming a serving discipline), solve a given problem, which cannot be solved by one discipline alone, in a joint way Besides this analytical perspective on interdisciplinarity there is also a sociocultural perspective that analyses interdisciplinarity as a learning process itself. Lattuca (2002) argues that the concept of apprenticeship is a core concept to understand how individuals from different academic disciplines learn from each other. She presents a study that analyses interdisciplinary scholarship from a learning and apprenticeship perspective and she qualitatively reports examples of the relational, mediated, transformative and situated nature of interdisciplinarity. Wagner et al. (2011) discuss a social perspective and a cognitive perspective to interdisciplinarity. While the social perspective takes interaction in teams of researchers from different disciplines as the anchor point, the cognitive perspective understands interdisciplinarity as cognitive process of individuals integrating concepts, methods and findings from different disciplines into own concepts and publications. Aboelela et al. (2007) present a literature review about interdisciplinary research. The authors discuss several approaches that can be taken for the study of interdisciplinary research: • In an interaction-oriented approach interdisciplinarity is analysed in terms of the ongoing cooperation between members of different scientific communities. • In a communication-oriented approach interdisciplinarity is analysed on the basis of communication happening between members of different scientific fields. • In a conceptual approach interdisciplinarity is seen as how concepts, ideas and models are integrated in the inquiry phase for solving a joint problem. • In an outcome-oriented approach the results of the cooperation are analysed. The outcome can be a joint product, prototype but also joint scientific publications. In the next section we summarize the discussion about interdisciplinarity in the field of Technology-Enhanced Learning. Interdisciplinarity in the field of Technology-Enhanced Learning and the Learning Sciences TEL is defined as an interdisciplinary field of research to which a number of disciplines contribute, namely: cognitive science, educational psychology, computer science, anthropology, sociology, information sciences, neurosciences, education, design studies, instructional design and others. While in most definitions TEL is more focused around the design of new technologies and their effect on learning and educational processes, the field of Learning Sciences is more concerned with forming theories about learning in relation to the technologies and tools used. Kolodner (2004) defines the Learning Sciences as a field dealing with the harvesting of “theories of active, constructivist, and participatory learning to design software and learning environments and ways of educating that promote deep and lasting learning”. Sawyer (2008) formulates the goal of the Learning Sciences as follows: “The goal of the learning sciences is to better understand the cognitive and social processes that result in the most effective learning, and to use this knowledge to redesign classrooms and other learning environments so that people learn more deeply and more effectively”. According to the author the field was established in the late 1980s based on the recognition that new scientific methods are needed that go beyond their own research field. We define technology-enhanced learning in a broad sense as any learning activity supported by digital technologies. Kirby, Hoadley, & Carr-Chellman (2005) have studied the relationship of the Instructional System Design (ISD) field and the Learning Sciences with a citation analysis. As a result of the analysis the authors state that the two fields are rather disconnected although they both focus on the use and development of technologies for learning. Hence, the dataset used for this analysis was rather small and it is questionable if we can identify the relation between two scientific disciplines or their level of interdisciplinarity based on such limited data. Plowman, Misailidou, & Laurillard (2007) have analysed 119 proposals submitted to the ESRC’s Teaching and Learning Research Programme (TLRP) in 2006. One of the core questions to be answered was the existence of “authentic interdisciplinary integration and innovation through applications from interdisciplinary teams that would bring together understandings of both learning and technology and draw upon perspectives from many disciplines”. In this study the profiles of applicants for grants in Technology-Enhanced Learning have been analyzed according to their departmental affiliation and disciplinary area. A multitude of disciplines could be identified in this study, but it is stated in the report that some proposals were not able to make the important step from multidisciplinary to truly integrated interdisciplinarity. Bransford et al. (2005) approach the topic of interdisciplinarity from the position that the learning sciences are in a decade of synergy between communities focusing on three research topics, namely cognitive neuroscience, technology-enhanced learning and nonformal learning support. They argue that these research fields have operated to date relatively independently from each other without further specifying on which empirical basis this finding about the current state of interdisciplinarity of the field is based.

This is done in an attempt to conceptually explore some of the political and practical challenges to participatory design today. Which things, and which participants? The perspective is strategic and conceptual. Two approaches are in focus, participatory design (designing for use before use) and meta-design (designing for design after design). With this framing the challenge for professional design to participate in public controversial things is considered.	framing (world wide web);metadesign	Pelle Ehn	2008		10.1145/1795234.1795248	public relations;design;design research;computer science;knowledge management;object;interaction design;public;management science;law	HCI	-63.06612559903564	-33.20835782984898	73445
9b512d585de3d683e9c7befaef9e94c6fb9bf994	deconstructing arguments via digital mining of online comments		I highlight and illustrate a recent practical strategy for critical argument analysis that I have devised. I refer to it as ‘digital argument deconstruction’. This strategy helps to establish critical purchase on arguments intended for consumption in the public sphere, particularly when readers might not be so knowledgeable about the standpoint being criticized in the argument. Digital argument deconstruction utilizes a recent technological facility—the appending of discussion forums to online arguments, e.g. in online newspapers. This facility allows readers to post responses to an argument and to debate issues raised in it. Taken as a whole, the online comments in the discussion forums can be regarded as supplements to these arguments. I highlight the convenient utility value of this digital supplementation for critical reading of arguments. Integral to this approach to critical reading is corpus linguistic method—the software-based analysis of collections of electronic texts. I show how corpus linguistic analysis of a discussion forum appended to an argument can help illuminate whether or not the argument distorts the standpoint it criticizes. I also show how there can be a penalty for such distortion—the cohesive structure of the argument can be shown to be unstable. Because an argument’s credibility and capacity to persuade are, amongst a number of things, dependent on effective cohesion, showing where an argument’s cohesion falls apart or ‘deconstructs’ diminishes its credibility. A theoretical stimulus for this approach comes from the work of the philosopher, Jacques Derrida. .................................................................................................................................................................................	algorithm;cohesion (computer science);control theory;distortion	Kieran O'Halloran	2015	DSH	10.1093/llc/fqu034	argument;argument map;epistemology;artificial intelligence;mathematics;social psychology	NLP	-65.86008025565295	-26.70409749179069	73493
af50ae537a08c6e7800f2c524c0b58fae0fd8949	die attraktivität der informatik und soziale aspekte der modernen softwareentwicklung im schulkontext		Computer science (CS) understands itself as being attractive and centered on social interaction. In contrast, society in particular adolescents recognize CS to be a soloist discipline. Hence, they hold a negative image of CS. Yet, focusing on social aspects in CS education can help to improve the image of CS. In middle school, CS education is mainly organized in group work rarely influenced by professional software development. However, aspects of software development (namely agile methods) would allow highlighting social processes in educational contexts. These approaches can only be found in higher education. In addition, the research community on child computer interaction shows little interest in social aspects. Thus, adolescents cannot be reached to cultivate a positive image of CS. Consequently, this retains future talent shortage in the discipline. Eight projects were conducted together with a total of 75 pupils (age 10–17). In these projects the tools scratch and Greenfoot were applied supported by agile methods. Working with the groups revealed several communicating issues and helped to compile requirements for computer supported learning. These can be summarized in three categories: Enable exchange, foster awareness, and support external presentation of outcomes. To address these requirements, this thesis proposes a prototype which extends scratch with three modules: a group platform, a group chat, and a wiki. Hence, users can follow group activities and interact with each other. To provide applicability of the prototype in class, a list of essential adaptions to agile methods is suggested. A focus on social aspects of the presented work is proved by meeting all requirements. Furthermore, cognitive walkthroughs and a weighted matrix from the perspectives of personas show positive results: Pupils who are interested in CS but who feel discouraged by falsely presumed underlying practices would strongly benefit from using the presented solutions. In conclusion, applying the proposed emphasis on social aspects to both tools and organization in class would help CS to become more attractive among adolescents.	agile software development;chat room;compiler;computer science;greenfoot;prototype;requirement;wiki	Timo Göttel	2012				HCI	-71.82811797461655	-37.008772131278846	73528

The Dublin Core was chosen because it provided a systematic, yet minimal way for students to describe these resources at the item level and relate them to collection-level metadata prepared for digitized primary sources by archivists using Encoded Archival Description (EAD). Researchers found that while students were able to supply simple elements such as title and subject with relative ease, they had difficulty moving between general and progressively more granular or refined descriptive elements. Students performed poorly in distinguishing between and completing related, but distinct metadata elements, such as title, subject, and description. Researchers also found that there are still significant issues that need to be addressed if young users in a variety of learning contexts, especially those who are only recently literate, are to be able to make sense of richer metadata such as EAD that is used to describe collections of primary source material.	archive;core data;dublin core;ead socket;ibm notes;information retrieval;information visualization;jargon;metaphysical naturalism;primary source;vocabulary	Anne J.

An analysis of the data revealed that the students found it useful and/or challenging to find and evaluate information on the Internet and to design digital products and that their digital skills improved in different ways. The teachers cited various approaches and purposes for using technology during the project and held varying assumptions about their students’ digital literacy skills.		Vera J.

I will present experimental evidence that machine learning techniques can be effectively used to improve personal information management tools in two ways. First, machine learning can be used to improve performance on certain types of difficult searches, notably searches that require some awareness of context. Second, machine learning can be used to reduce the chance of certain high-cost errors. One type of high-cost error we consider is the “dropped ball”—i.e., losing track of a task that has been delegated, in part or whole, to others. The second type of high-cost error is an “email leak”—i.e., mistakenly sending a sensitive email message to the wrong recipient.	computer;email;machine learning;personal information management;personally identifiable information;workstation	Eric P.

Therefore, there is need for school districts to focus on appropriate technology development activities that could help teachers and students to overcome the barriers in technology integration. Further, school leaders must make sure that the technology integration practices translate to proactive laptop implementation to enhance effective student-centered learning in the digital age.

There is a strong need for the incorporation problem solving and emerging neuroscience technologies into mainstream classrooms, and for students and teachers to experience what it means at a very personal level, to engage in and struggle with solving difficult science problems. An innovating and engaging way of doing this is by making the problem solving process visible through the use of realtime electroencephalography cognitive metrics. There are educational, task, and measurement challenges that must be addressed to accomplish this goal. In this paper we detail some of these challenges, and possible solutions, to develop a framework for a new set of Interactive Neuro-Educational Technologies (I-Net).	cognitive science;electroencephalography;problem solving	Ronald H.

CAT augments the expressive power of Web pages for publishing passive multimedia information with a full-fledged interactive algorithm animation system. It improves on previous Web-based algorithm animations by providing a framework that makes it easy to construct new animations, including those that involve multiple views. Because views of the same running algorithm may reside on different machines, CAT is particularly well-suited for electronic classrooms and remote learning environments. This strategy is an improvement over the electronic classroom systems we are aware of, which simply display the same X window on multiple machines and are only viable in local-area networks. We believe our framework generalizes to electronic textbooks in arbitrary domains.		Marc H. Brown;Marc Najork	1997	J. Vis. Lang.

The methodology integrates measures from ‘the pace of technological innovativeness’ and the ‘technology acceptance model’ to understand the rationale for further ICT investment in compulsory education. A quantitative study was carried out amongst 241 educators in Malta. It has investigated the costs and benefits of using digital learning resources in schools from the educators’ perspective. A principal component analysis has indicated that the educators were committed to using digital technologies. In addition, a stepwise regression analysis has shown that the younger teachers were increasingly engaging in digital learning resources. Following this study’s empirical findings educational stakeholders are better informed about how innovative technologies can support our students. In conclusion, this contribution puts forward key implications and recommendations for regulatory authorities and policy makers for better curricula and educational outcomes.

Two of these papers specifically consider how the objective complexity of the domain being studied changes the nature of the solution—with domains consisting of many interacting elements and changing criteria for success tending to produce highly rugged fitness landscapes that violate the normal assumptions of decomposability that we make in our research and incorporate into our theories. A third paper considers how the concept of utility impacts informing and is impacted by complexity. Another pair of papers examines, first, how the structure of a client’s mental models—referred to as structural complexity—changes with repetitive task performance and, then, how various cognitive filters work in concert with this structure during the informing process. The final paper specifically considers client-to-client informing processes, using the diffusion literature to argue that they are indispensible to complex informing and further mapping different models to different levels of informing complexity. Collectively, it is hoped that these papers will spur further research into the processes that enable complex informing.	interaction;mental model;rugged computer;structural complexity (applied mathematics);theory	T.

The student will have an opportunity to learn about the social aspect of IR with a focus on collaborative information seeking (CIS) situations, systems, and evaluation techniques. Traditionally, IR is considered an individual pursuit, and not surprisingly, the majority of tools, techniques, and models developed for addressing information need, retrieval, and usage have focused on single users. The assumption of information seekers being independent and IR problem being individual has been challenged often in the recent past. This course will introduce such works to the students, with an emphasis on understanding models and systems that support collaborative search or browsing. In addition, the course will provide samples of data collected through several experiments to demonstrate various mining and analysis techniques.   Specifically, the course will (1) outline the research and latest developments in the field of collaborative IR, (2) list the challenges for designing and evaluating collaborative IR systems, and (3) show how traditional single user IR models and systems could be mapped to those for CIS. This will be achieved through introduction to appropriate literature, algorithms and interfaces that facilitate CIS, and methodologies for studying and evaluating them. Thus, the course will offer a balance between theoretical and practical elements of CIS.	algorithm;collaborative information seeking;experiment;information needs;information retrieval;multi-user;theory	Chirag Shah	2012		10.1145/2124295.2124392	information needs;computer science;knowledge management;data mining;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval;statistics;data collection	Web+IR	-67.40388641934213	-37.48101959406705	74292

Findings indicated increase in students’ disposition towards open-mindedness, especially related to gender equity. Findings also indicated positive views related to operative, cognitive, and affective aspects of the platform’s usability.

We discuss our own writing relationships and find that our metaphors to describe them are different due, for example, to cultural differences. There are no necessarily ‘good’ or ‘bad’ ways of working (or metaphors that represent these), as whatever works is appropriate. On the other hand working relationships need to develop and change over time as our writing skills improve and our co-writing relationship matures. Using metaphors can help us understand new ways of working. In writing this paper we used metaphors to help us both guide the process and understand what is most appropriate for us in different circumstances and reflect on how this has changed over time.	reflection (computer graphics)	David E.

There is a need for Business schools to integrate academic activities with all other relevant processes such that at the end of their tenure, the students are ready to tackle issues related to society, business and technology. However, for this to happen, the Business schools need to redesign their approach for framing the curriculum. Instead of designing a standalone curriculum, the Business schools need to understand the requirements of all stakeholders such as recruiters, business, students and faculty. The Business schools can achieve this by gaining knowledge through research, consulting and delivering through improved pedagogy using technology. For this research, data was collected by conducting primary survey of 5 Business schools taken as case study and using secondary source to get details of their processes. The findings can be used by any other Business school aspiring to produce effective managers.	bridging (networking);business requirements;framing (world wide web);holism;requirement;scheduling (computing);seamless3d;secondary source;system integration	Sanjay Mohapatra	2013	Education and Information Technologies	10.1007/s10639-013-9287-3	psychology;business model;business analysis;educational technology;business education;business requirements;business process reengineering;knowledge management;business case;electronic business;process management;business relationship management;management;new business development;pedagogy;business architecture;technology	HCI	-76.49115224226918	-31.923726304830584	74639

The traditional method of teaching makes a presumption that the student has little to contn'bute to the learning process. Instructions become directives as information is delivered in a continual stream of facts and figures; ¢ommaniccation is tmidh'ectionaJ with limited interactive learning. This poster presentation is a report of a prel/m/nary study on how puzzles (problem solving and lateral thinlcin~ problems) can be used as interactive learnin~ agents for subjects requiring problem solving. Puzzles were viewed as a natural extension of knowledge based systems and were inlroduced into the lecture format. The puzzles were seen as having two initial benefits. The first benefit is an increase in the participation and interaction of the students. Three to four puzzles are employed at various intervals throughout the lecture. The I ~ l e s are of three to five minmes in duration. According to Bligh [1] the imroduction of a period of change during the lecture (a period where either a short break or a change in the teaching method occurs) can have a positive affect on the level of performance of the students The second benefit is as a tool to create an environment of problem awareness. The puzzles used are a natural extension of the learning process in knowledge based systems rather than an intrusion into it. The p-~les require admini~Uation of a level of problem solving ability, lateral-th/nlcin~ ~'lcillg and ~ p ~ l e s complexity is consistent with the aimg and objectives of the subject. This poster presentation reviews the preliminary survey, and cm'r~t findings, together with a ~rr~le of puzzles, com~e material used during the lecture series.

By working through assessable complex problem-solving tasks learners can be encouraged to actively engage in investigation and inquiry and to use high level cognitive thought processes to solve real-life problems in professional contexts. A critical element of a successful PBL design is the inclusion of instructional support, such as scaffolding, to guide and assist the learner through the reasoning process that is crucial to successful problem-solving. The e-learning tool ‘Challenge FRAP’ (Form for the Recording of the Analysis of Problems) is client-based public domain authoring software which facilitates the use of scaffolding, the provision of progressive feedback and can promote student reflection at key decision-making points. This paper illustrates the benefits of such an e-learning scaffolding tool through two PBL case studies; one group-based PBL task in science and technology and one selfdirected PBL task in plant pathology.	critical graph;fraps;high-level programming language;problem solving;real life	Terry M.

These forces have moved much of life sciences research almost completely into the computational domain. Importantly, educational training in biomedical informatics has been limited to students enrolled in the life sciences curricula, yet much of the skills needed to succeed in biomedical informatics involve or augment training in information technology curricula. This manuscript describes the methods and rationale for training students enrolled in information technology curricula in the field of biomedical informatics, which augments the existing information technology curriculum and provides training on specific subjects in Biomedical Informatics not emphasized in bioinformatics courses offered in life science programs, and does not require prerequisite courses in the life sciences.	bioinformatics;computational biology;design rationale;informatics	Michael D.

It is designed to show if a particular cognitive theory is complete and coherent at multiple levels of discourse, and commensurable with and relevant to a wider domain of cognition. WikiSilo is also a minimalist theory and methodology about effectively doing science, and is therefore a form of epistemizing. WikiSilo theory provides for a disciplined exploration of explanatory space via an axiomatic hierarchy of epistemizing and ontologizing postulates. The WikiSilo tool, via a software version control system, supports the long term goal of working toward coherent and unified theories. More generally, WikiSilo facilitates self-organization leading to academic silos with well-defined conceptual frameworks that are vertically related as compared to poorly related ad-hoc academic fiefdoms.	cognition;cognitive science;coherence (physics);control system;crowdsourcing;hoc (programming language);organizing (structure);self-organization;software versioning;theory;version control;vocabulary	David Pierre Leibovitz;Robert L.

While each RSG is encouraged to act independently and address the local needs of its regional student membership, a significant amount of effort is also invested in coordinating affiliation of these groups with the international student body, which provides long-term direction and facilitates communication between groups. Participating in a global student network provides students with an opportunity to network and connect with others around the globe. By sharing experiences within the network, students gain cultural insights and awareness of regional differences in scientific research and industry. In this article, we provide an overview of the tasks involved in setting-up and managing this global student network for bioinformatics. We also highlight the benefits a global student network offers, in the hope that other fields can use this to create their own global student network.	achievement;bioinformatics;computation;computational biology;experience;global network;greater;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;benefit	Avinash Kumar Shanmugam;Geoff Macintyre	2014		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003920	computational biology;biology;bioinformatics;social network	HPC	-76.51328118860017	-24.501007233747906	75434
35516bff68f2fdcba9199bffa3f9a673801095ec	a template for a media commons typology	technology enhanced learning;classroom and laboratory integration;learning environments design	This paper proposes an adaptable media commons concept as a foundational element for the design of learning spaces. The concept is based on the possibility to create flexible and resourceful spatial situations that can structure pedagogical and creative environments. The essential core elements, spaces, and artifacts of the media commons project are equipped with technology that enable various multi-media venues and practices of information transfer. This auditorium-classroom-laboratory integrated scenario would basically act as a dynamic environment that would link pedagogy, creativity, and knowledge formation as a product of social interaction in a specific set of spaces. This position paper about two manifestations of the media commons project at the Rio Piedras campus of the University of Puerto Rico, is basically a research and development study proposal on typological variations of an ensemble for in-person and remote collaborative space -such as or similar to that of design studios, innovation hubs, and online forums and platformsand their effect on creativity, participation and authority in a pedagogical setting. 1 GENERATION OF THE TEMPLATE The proposal for a media commons project presented in the following paper is part of the research conducted by sTAND (Studies in Architectural Narratives and Digital Design), an initiative primarily interested in knowledge transfer through new technologies in the field of architectural design. The development of a media commons concept is an applied research design exercise based on the idea of creating a system of spaces that aims to stimulate the senses, encourage exchange of information and offer opportunities for rehearsal, feedback, application and transfer. A combination of laboratory spaces, public forum, and community center, the Media Commons variations here presented are part of an effort that seeks to establish a network of active learning environments and foster the development of a strong community of users. 1.1 The Media Commons Concept	biological anthropology;rico;winsock	Javier Isado	2015		10.5220/0005476804330437	psychology;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;software engineering;multimedia;management;world wide web;pedagogy	HCI	-72.14809751905973	-37.28425578558268	75485

2587df6a25ac91947f61402cf491b23a980e02e3	online instructors: andragogical or pedagogical teaching?		"""This study investigates the andragogical and pedagogical teaching philosophies of online instructors at the California State University, Long Beach in the Spring Semester of 2010. Drawing from reflective adult education theory, this article proposes a new model for this reflective adult education theory. It is either the helping relationship (andragogical philosophy) or the directing relationship (pedagogical philosophy) plus the learning environment (the Internet) that leads to adult learners’ critical reflection in Mezirow’s (1991) terms. A researcher-designed survey instrument called Online Philosophy of Adult Education Scale (OPAES) was used to measure instructional preferences of these instructors in the electronic classroom to determine their andragogical or pedagogical teaching philosophies. Data were collected from 37 online instructors regarding their instructional preferences. Nine qualitative questions were designed to parallel the Likert scale OPAES to determine why these online adult education instructors chose their pedagogical or andragogical teaching philosophies. The results of the study demonstrate that these online adult education instructors support both the teacher-centered approach and the student-centered approach to teaching online. is in how to maximize their learning without the benefit of having a face-to-face discussion with their instructors. Adult learners may hold full time jobs and have family responsibilities, which may make physical travel to a campus for class difficult or even impossible, thus online courses are appealing. To some extent, andragogy was designed to maximize adult learning especially adults’ online transformation where the individual adult learner is a “free-agent” in his or her own learning. To some scholars, andragogy is more a technological application of psychological and sociological knowledge. However, to Knowles, it became a continuum from teacher-directed to DOI: 10.4018/javet.2011070102 International Journal of Adult Vocational Education and Technology, 2(3), 12-29, July-September 2011 13 Copyright © 2011, IGI Global.

This student-centered learning is a democratic approach to teaching and learning. Influential scholars have delved into the principles of andragogy such as selfconcept of adult learners (Tough, 1967, 1971; Knowles, 1975; Mezirow, 1985; Brookfield, 1986; Pratt, 1988, 1993; Brockett & Hiemstra, 1991; Candy, 1991; Merriam & Caffarella, 1999; Merriam, 2001). Because adult learners are capable of self-direction in learning, some scholars doubt whether a teacher-learner relationship is really needed given the asynchronous nature of cyberspace learning. Rhode (2009) investigated adult learners’ preferences in a self-paced online environment, rather than the traditional course calendar many higher education institutions utilize. However, to say this teacher-learner relationship is not needed is to overemphasize the power of self-direction. Even when adult learners are highly self-directed, an andragogical type of teacher-learner relationship may facilitate adult learning. When adult learners are highly self-directed, they may also require the traditional pedagogical teacher-learner relationship because of speed, convenience, previous experience in courses, or learning styles. Not only is this relationship necessary, but also the kinds of andragogical and pedagogical teaching philosophies online instructors may hold strongly affecting this relationship, hence adult online transformation. “Most students have a tendency for sensing, visual, and active styles of learning. However, most college courses follow the lecture teaching style” (Wirz, 2004, p. 2). The instructors’ teaching philosophies lead to the methods and art of teaching. Ultimately, students’ critical reflection is affected by these methods and art of teaching. However, no empirical study has been conducted to determine online instructors’ teaching philosophies. Most literature has focused on the learners’ preferences (Rhodes, 2009) rather than the instructor’s. The present study is an investigation to determine and describe online instructors’ andragogical and /or pedagogical teaching philosophies. The humanistic principles of andragogy support a helping relationship (andragogical philosophy) between teachers and learners whereas principles of pedagogy indicate a directing relationship (pedagogical philosophy) between teachers and learners. This exploratory study is only a first step to examining this concept. “Although a learner-centered approach is strongly supported in the literature, a teachercentered approach is widely practiced in community college and university settings” wrote Kraska and Harris (2007, p. 19) in their study of cognitive style and teaching style. They found no relationship between the two in a sample of 65 students enrolled in Air Force Reserve Officer Training. Their study emphasized the importance of innovating in teaching, rather than recruiting those with the same style. However, this study did not specifically examine online learning, although the sample did consist of adult educators. For self-directed adult learners, online learning requires an andragogical relationship with their instructors. As a consultant or delegator, instructors link their students to learning resources. In contrast, the pedagogical information transmitter will only disappoint self-directed adult learners who are experienced with a subject matter and are capable of teaching themselves. However, the information transmitter is highly helpful when adult learners are inexperienced with a subject matter and do not have independent learning skills. The andragogical instructor should provide topics-driven courses with open-ended questions. Such online activities leave much room for adult learners’ prior experience, which serves as the best resource for learning. “Online learners desire an instructor who addresses them as individuals and offers supportive comments” (Dennen et al., 2007, p. 68). When online topicsdriven courses with open-ended questions are designed to accept their viewpoints (Wang, 2003), adult learners feel they are treated with dignity and respect. In this context, online adult education becomes andragogical education. For this to occur, students must interact with the instructor, with each other, and with the content (Dennen et al., 2007; Rhode, 2009).

Self-tracking technologies are increasingly used to understand, track and predict these fluxes and physiological processes. This paper outlines ongoing research that investigates the mediating qualities of self-tracking technologies. As physiological fluxes and processes are more commonly experienced by women, and have been historically used as a tool for subjugation, a feminist perspective and methodology is applied within this research. Methods including research-through-design and speculative and critical design are used to test the hypothesis that through speculating on the design of self-tracking technologies, valuable knowledge can be contributed to the fields of HCI and interaction design in relation to subjects such as the societal taboos and prejudices surrounding the notion of the changing body, privacy of biodata and how identity and sense of self is shaped through the act of self-tracking.	human–computer interaction;interaction design;self-censorship;speculative execution	Sarah Homewood	2018		10.1145/3170427.3173031	biodata;knowledge management;critical design;human–computer interaction;prejudice;interaction design;psychology of self;computer science	HCI	-63.211471485691256	-34.74489005535056	76656

Private servers allow players to return to previous versions of a game before changes that modified it. Research indicates that changes to the current version of WoW discourage sociality and are upsetting for many players. Through a year-long ethnography, we found that the stories, memories, struggles, and concerns that players shared on Nostalrius Begins allowed them to rebuild the social community that they missed from earlier versions of the game. Over time, however, the neoliberal ideology of offline culture influenced players’ behaviors and affected social experience in a different way. Our research provides an analysis of the tension between community and neoliberal values in online games.	experience;online and offline;private server;server (computing);world of warcraft	Nicole Crenshaw;Jaclyn LaMorte;Bonnie A.

Thus, it is important to ensure that all students engage with self-paced learning tools effectively in order to learn the content deeply, develop good problem-solving skills, and transfer their learning from one context to another. Here we first provide an overview of a holistic framework for engaging students with self-paced learning tools so that they can transfer their learning to solve novel problems. The framework not only takes into account the features of the self-paced learning tools but also how those tools are implemented, the extent to which the tools take into account student characteristics, and whether factors related to students’ social environments are accounted for appropriately in the implementation of those tools. We then describe an investigation in which we interpret the findings using the framework. In this study, a research-validated self-paced physics tutorial was implemented in both controlled one-on-one interviews and in large enrollment, introductory calculus-based physics courses as a self-paced learning tool. We find that students who used the tutorial in a controlled one-on-one interview situation performed significantly better on transfer problems than those who used it as a self-paced learning tool in the large-scale implementation. The findings suggest that critically examining and taking into account how the self-paced tools are implemented and incentivized, student characteristics including their self-regulation and time-management skills, and social and environmental factors can greatly impact the extent and manner in which students engage with these learning tools. Motivating and getting buy-in from students of the value of these tools and providing appropriate support while implementing them is critical for ensuring that students, who otherwise may be constrained by motivational, social, and environmental factors, engage effectively with the tools in order to learn deeply and transfer their learning.	digital electronics;holism;norm (social);problem solving	Emily Megan Marshman;Seth DeVore;Chandralekha Singh	2018	Front.

Lippincott and Peter Hirtle for their review and advice, and to our colleagues at the Illinois Digital Archives Project, the Don Hunter Archive Project and the New Jersey Digital Highway Project for sharing their experiences through case studies. A note on the sponsorship of this Framework: The first edition of this document was funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). IMLS supported the development of the Framework to encourage institutions to plan their digitization practices strategically in order to develop collections that will be accessible and useful for the long-term, and that can integrate with other digital collections to support a growing network of broadly accessible digital information resources. IMLS encourages use of this Framework to assist collection developers in planning and implementing good digital practices. However, use of the Framework is not linked to IMLS funding, which is determined by separate proposal, evaluation, and selection procedures that are documented in depth on the IMLS website. This second edition is now supported by the National Information Standards Organization (NISO), an organization that supports the development and maintenance of information standards and guidelines for the support of good practices in digital information development and sharing.	archive;digital data	Timothy W.

a6de97a9e0eb1ea78ba2b7c5857200282b8ab565	five aspirations for educational data mining		In this talk we present our disciplinary, methodological, and social aspirations for Educational Data Mining. These aspirations are based on broad conceptualizations of the nature of education and data analysis as social endeavors. These aspirations fall into five categories which begin with the statement that “We hope that Educational Data Mining will...” 1) Consider the broad range of the social and organizational aspects of education and its administration, including informal and ubiquitous learning; 2) Consider the broad range of inputs of digital artifacts that feed into the design of learning systems (not just the outcomes of system interactions); 3) Consider data mining as a human endeavor which is itself a proper topic of psychological, sociological and other academic disciplines; 4) Remember the fundamentals of quality data analysis regardless of computational techniques (with special fondness for John Tukey’s insights); 5) Provide information that celebrates the diversity of effective pedagogies and supports learning by the outliers, hidden clusters, and otherwise missed special groups of people that are lost in the averages or other insensitive aggregations. We have high expectations for the field of Educational Data Mining to evolve broadly and contribute broadly to education and society.	digital artifact;educational data mining;interaction	Bob Dolan;John Behrens	2012			data science;computer science;digital artifact;discipline;social group;ubiquitous learning;educational data mining	ML	-73.51342869100384	-29.93245211616149	77213
bb9f59ca743f3292b7aba32cbd03c66285d4f5a0	rapid development of public health education systems in low-literacy multilingual environments: combating ebola through voice messaging		One of the main challenges in combating the spread of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a lack of effective public health education among affected populations in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Difficulties include resistance to official sources of information, mistrust of government, cultural norms, linguistic barriers, and illiteracy. In this paper we describe the development and initial deployment of a voice-based, multilingual mobile phone application to spread reliable public health information about Ebola via peer-to-peer sharing. Our hypothesis is that we can overcome mistrust and disseminate important health information via the power of social learning and suggestion from friends, family, and local communities. In collaboration with partners on the ground in Conakry, Guinea, we have launched two parallel mobile phone services known as Polly Game and Polly Health to enable message sharing in several Guinean languages. We discuss a variety of strategies we have tried to encourage the spread of the application and data on uptake to date.	distrust;mobile app;mobile phone;norm (social);peer-to-peer;polly (robot);population;software deployment	Nikolas Wolfe;Juneki Hong;Agha Ali Raza;Bhiksha Raj;Ronald Rosenfeld	2015			speech recognition;computer science;public health;literacy;multimedia	HCI	-67.83728598247319	-29.862159508124254	77220

In response to the sense that these pedagogical approaches may no longer be working, newer student-centric approaches such as using serious games as a pedagogical tool have been gaining prominence. However, there is no clear definition as yet on what construes an effective game-based learning pedagogical methodology and no definitive method to capture learning outcomes.This paper contributes a learning framework that uses evidence-centered design in epistemic games to model learning outcomes for management students and practitioners. The authors also report on a pilot study involving a new simulation game – STRAT UP – based on the above framework, to explore how such games can help in capturing evidence to measure learning outcomes for the Human Resource function.	simulation;teaching method	Sandeep Rambhatla;Deepak Gupta	2016	2016 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Technology for Education (T4E)	10.1109/T4E.2016.031	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;management science	Robotics	-75.30867196187518	-36.998857544898	77225

This field is peculiar, as it is characterized by the urgency to preserve and disseminate some of the most peculiar intangible artistic expressions, especially those at risk of disappearing; so far these cultural expressions have been passed down mainly through imitation and oral tradition, so now technologies can play a role in fostering their preservation and documentation. Drawing on the discussion held in recent years in the field of Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL), the paper describes a web-based tool aimed to support the collaborative design and planning of innovative ICT-based learning/teaching activities in ICH education. While providing an overview of the main functionalities of such a tool, the paper solicits some reflections on how TEL approaches, techniques and tools can fruitfully be employed to sustain ICH education.	amiga reflections;automated planning and scheduling;documentation;pp (complexity);the european library;web application	Michela Ott;Francesca Maria Dagnino;Francesca Pozzi	2015	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2014.11.039	psychology;social science;knowledge management;multimedia;sociology;management;social psychology;world wide web;collaboration	HCI	-64.67899406961024	-34.77912817598295	77347

This study used two innovative tools, Google Trends and Web analytics, to explore interest in and usage of the PhET website, one of the most well-known online science simulation resources. This study found that search interest in the PhET science simulations has been growing continuously since 2005. However, search interest in PhET was positively correlated with academic performance and income, and negatively correlated with the achievement gap between highand lowperforming students. Moreover, Internet users in states with more White students were more interested in the PhET science simulations. Yet Internet users in states with more Black students were less interested in these science simulations. These findings suggest that the way online STEM resources are being used is likely to widen, rather than narrow, the achievement gap. This is the first study to utilize Internet search trend data and Web analytics tools for monitoring Internet use for educational purposes. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigate how students respond to substantive changes that accompany a comprehensive integration of technology with the teaching and learning of secondary science and physics. Specifically, we ask: (1) Do female students view, participate, and achieve differently than male students in technology enhanced science classrooms? and, (2) If not, why not? Empirical evidence collected over seven years includes: classroom observations, student interviews and questionaires, classroom achievement records, and journal entries; Findings from the study illustrate that sound pedagogical practices and social organization in technology enhanced secondary science classrooms can promote a gender inclusive experience, where women and men participate and perform equally well. Methodologically, the study also illustrates how a consideration of the complexity of classroom environments contributes to rich contextual understanding of the interplay of technology, teaching, and learning.	closing (morphology)	Jolie A.

Quality assurance (QA) has become a prominent issue, not only for educational institutions and accreditors, but also for students and employers alike. This paper describes some of the rather unique QA processes used at Universitas 21 Global (U21G), one of the new breed of online academic institutions, and its relation to U21pedagogica, the independent agency that approves U21G’s programmes. These distinctive QA processes relate to five main areas, namely, content authoring, courseware development, adjunct faculty recruitment, pedagogy and delivery. The authors believe that these QA processes have contributed significantly to student satisfaction and student retention at U21G. Furthermore, these QA processes can also be adapted to suit more traditional ‘brick-and-mortar’ universities offering online programmes. Introduction Over the past decade, online education has become increasingly more commonplace at institutions of higher education (Schrum & Hong, 2002). In 2001, 1979 out of the 5655 higher education institutions accredited by accreditors recognised by the US Department of Education or Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) offered some form of distance learning, some of which leads to degree acquisition (CHEA, 2002). Even as online programmes proliferate, many stakeholders remain apprehensive over the quality of online education in comparison with more traditional face-to-face forms of education (Barbera, 2004; Twigg, 2001). For instance, students are concerned about the richness of the learning experience and whether qualifications earned via online 134 British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 38 No 1 2007 © 2006 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2006 British Educational Communications and Technology Agency. programmes enjoy comparable recognition vis-à-vis those earned through face-to-face programmes. Employers are concerned about the effectiveness of learning and whether an online programme can truly prepare students for roles in the workplace. Academics are concerned about academic rigour and level of intellectual stimulation and challenge. Similarly, governments and accreditation agencies are concerned about quality standards and the integrity of the institution delivering online education. Quality assurance (QA) therefore plays a critical role in allaying stakeholder concerns regarding the quality of online education, and is becoming an increasingly important aspect that educators, administrators and policy makers are finding hard to ignore. This paper examines the QA processes used at Universitas 21 Global (U21G), a newly established academic institution that delivers its academic programmes entirely online. Consistent with the practices in reputable academic institutions, U21G uses a variety of QA processes to ensure the quality of its programmes in areas such as curriculum review. More significantly, U21G has developed QA processes in a number of other academic areas germane to online education. The focus of this paper lies in the QA processes of five key areas, namely, content authoring, courseware development, adjunct faculty recruitment, pedagogy and delivery.	compiler;potentially visible set;software quality assurance	Alton Yeow-Kuan Chua;Wing Lam	2007	BJET	10.1111/j.1467-8535.2006.00652.x	psychology;quality assurance;quality control;teaching method;multimedia;higher education;management;pedagogy	Web+IR	-76.51370545870677	-31.214299514559592	78735

We first characterize a work setting in which we expected an e-book to be a useful interface for reading and otherwise using a mix of physical and digital library materials, and explore what kinds of reading-related functionality would bring value to this setting. We do this by describing important aspects of legal research in a heterogeneous information environment, including mobility, reading, annotation, link following and writing practices, and their general implications for design. We then discuss how our work with a user community and an evolving e-book prototype allowed us to examine tandem issues of usability and utility, and to redesign an existing e-book user interface to suit the needs of law students.

This mission is entirely understandable when viewed through the tradition of ongoing cultural exhibition in wellpopulated urban locations, yet sits less comfortably within the wide geographic distribution of the Australian population. Although a growing desire to reach wider audiences via an expanded online presence is evident, such initiatives are tempered by the prohibitive cost of digitising existing collections optimised for physical exhibition. Significant amounts if not the majority of compelling cultural content remain inaccessible to communities and the general public. Multi-Platform Communication Design is a design method which repurposes existing content across multiple communication channels in order to extend an audience experience across multiple target segments. Applied to the cultural institution sector, MPCD takes existing platformor site-specific artefacts to new, distributed audiences in a cost-effective manner. In so doing, MPCD can extend and increase the audience experience beyond current curatorial and audience expectations. The rationale behind MPCD lies neither in a technological orientation nor blue skies research. Rather, it is firmly focused in providing a tool whereby cultural institutions can reach a wider audience cost-effectively, and communities can not only access content more readily, they may also contribute to the creation of digital collections. This paper acknowledges the exciting potential of synchronous iTV/web broadcast and contributes to the developing multi-platform debate by defining outcomes for both consumers and producers and links this debate to the emerging concept of a “cultural consumer” within this sector.	design rationale;the australian	Jerry Watkins;Angelina Russo	2005			public relations;engineering;multimedia;advertising	HCI	-67.25122301811813	-30.023069630171378	79515

ac303f5fbe2aa6cb40464ebea5fcce5841fbdb79	electronic markets on the media industry		It is a truism that information technology (IT) is transforming the media industry. In fact, a brief Google search on the words Bmedia industry^ AND Btransformation^ AND Binformation technology^ at the end of 2016 yielded a total of about 294,000 results. This link between the media and the IT industry has not always been obvious as the case of the well-known example of Apple Music and Apple Computer illustrates. In 1991, Apple Computer reached an agreement with the music label Apple Corps Bnot to get in the music business^ (Anonymous 2006). Since the latter company was founded by the Beatles, songs from this band were not available on iTunes for years and both companies only settled the case after long legal disputes. The story highlights that Bdigitization of music means that today a song is just another computer file [...and] to say that a company is Bin the record business^ just because it sells a certain type of file is mindset out of the eight-track age.^ (Anonymous 2006). Although the music and the computing industry have been separate for a long time, both industries have converged not only sweeping away renowned publishers (e.g. Encyclopedia Britannica) or book retailers (e.g. Borders), but also pressurizing existing companies (e.g. Elsevier, Sony, Springer, Wiley) and giving way to numerous new players, such as Amazon, Ebsco, Facebook, Netflix, Proquest, Researchgate, Spotify or Twitter.

e4df5071a84cd5dd439089be2aadce4e6e40276c	in memory of gary marsden	gary marsden	Gary Marsden, professor of computer science at the University of Cape Town, pioneer and passionate advocate of HCI for development and community builder, died suddenly of a heart attack on December 27, 2013, at the age of 43. Disciplinary divisions, bureaucratic firewalls, pomp, and pretension—all were anathema to his playful mind. He cared passionately about his work; impact truly was at the heart of what he did and stood for, whether it was teaching programming to undergraduates, tinkering and DIY projects with rural communities, or walking the talk with top brass in industry. Gary began his academic career at Stirling University, Scotland. During his final year as an undergraduate, Harold Thimbleby piqued his interest in the seemingly strange—to a selfconfessed geeky computer scientist— field of HCI. While being a convert to human-centered computing, Gary had a natural gift for understanding what made a good user experience and the value of participatory design. One of his vacation jobs was as a character actor at a U.S. theme park, where he deftly made paper-boat hats with visitors. He once explained why this summer job made him so happy: It was fun but serious, hands-on, helped people learn, and, importantly, made them laugh. This was Gary’s leitmotif throughout his academic life—as anyone who attended his lecture courses, keynotes, and workshops around the world will know. Gary was awarded a Ph.D. for his thesis on interface tools for end users and took up a lectureship in HCI at Middlesex University, London, in the mid-1990s, where he helped to establish the Interaction Design Centre. He was a research entrepreneur from those early days; it was clear to those around him that he was full of joyful energy and enthusiasm, making connections and seeking out opportunities to make the world a better place. In London he did some of the earliest work on mobile information access, which led to his popular book co-authored with Matt Jones, Mobile Interaction Design. During his time at Middlesex, Gary was seconded to teach HCI in Cairo for several weeks each year. One night, on returning from class, he joined a table of older academics from around the world, all strangers but brought together through this assignment. One of the guys, cigar and whiskey in hand, looked across the table and said, “Boys, enjoy this, it is as good as it gets!” Gary would later regale others with this story, and with a wry smile and while imitating the guy, one-up him by saying, “The best is yet to come.” After four years of spending his working life inside a metal box with limited windows on the North Circular Road in London, Gary escaped to the open skies and sunshine of South Africa, where he took up a lectureship post in 1999 at the University of Cape Town. While many were going in the opposite direction because of the political events happening at that time, Gary strode forth where others dared not. In just a few years, he had managed to put HCI in South Africa and South Africa in HCI. Gary became internationally known for his work in mobile interface design, design, and ICT for development (ICT4D)—for which he was a recipient of ACM SIGCHI’s Social Impact Award in 2007. He went to great lengths to show how mobile technologies were revolutionizing how developing countries were advancing apace. In doing so, he raised the profile of what developing world actually meant. Most important, he stressed throughout his research, his many hands-on activities, and his writings that those who were privileged like himself should not try to help others who were worse off, but instead should find ways of working alongside them. His approach was to promote empowerment through technology, enabling other people to become better equipped to the In Memory of Gary Marsden GUE s T c OLUMn	bricolage;computer science;computer scientist;firewall (computing);geek;hands-on computing;harold thimbleby;human-centered computing;human–computer interaction;information access;interaction design;jones calculus;microsoft windows;mobile interaction;sigchi;theme park;user experience;cairo	Matt Jones;Yvonne Rogers	2014	Interactions	10.1145/2574859	multimedia;human–computer interaction;engineering	HCI	-63.49832953437031	-24.797722970281242	80277

We may differ in many ways, yet we have important commonalities. Aside from the amazing people I met at UMLW, I came away recognizing a huge opportunity for the computing education community. First: if you are looking for excellent examples of the application of computing to real and pressing social issues, there is a treasure trove of complex pedagogically ripe material within the development community. Second: the development community and the computing education community can benefit equally from developing a dialog. For example, the development community is wrestling with issues we have studied extensively concerning what works and doesn’t work when mobile phones and tablets are put in the hands of students—especially when it comes to the realm of classroom management and content learning. Conversely, the development community has extensive knowledge and understanding about what works and what doesn’t work with targeted empowerment efforts and workforce development. I could go on about how my MOOC experience not only taught me something about the power of high quality, free, online learning but prepared me in completely unanticipated ways for new and exciting avenues within computing education. I could point out that for those of us who care deeply about using computing to make a positive difference in the world here are opportunities to do so and be on the cutting edge of technological development.

Schools of business are now more engaged in assessment activities than a few years ago. Assessment activities are costly and the emphasis seems to be placed on assessing critical thinking, communication skills, technology/computer usage, professional knowledge, and problem solving. Colleges of business are relying heavily on course-embedded measures, followed by indirect measures of assessment. Curriculum and instructional changes were the top-ranked uses of assessment results.		Nitham M. Hindi;Mohammad K.

Unfortunately, educators are still influenced by the clinical view of deafness as a deficiency to be removed, and that view influences their pedagogical praxis that lack proper pedagogical tools. Additionally, there has been a political setback: special schools for the deaf in Brazil are being closed. Mainstream schools are not able to cope with the demands and the deaf are thus further marginalized. This research presents a pedagogical framework that educators have used successfully to prepare classroom-teaching materials. The framework was implemented into a system that guides educators in the design of Learning Objects.	altran praxis;angular defect;pedagogical agent;piaget's theory of cognitive development	Cayley Guimaraes;Moises H.

This study also identifies the enabling factors, the traffic-jam and, forecasts the future growth of E-learning in Nigeria. Survey research method was adopted for the study, and questionnaire was the only instrument used for the data collection. The findings of the study show that out of the 18 universities selected from different specialization areas, i.e three universities from each Geopolitical zone, only 12 responded with usable answers. The response rate was 67%, which is an expected rate for such surveys. Awareness of e-learning among the Universities is very high but investment and commitment to develop an e-learning application is very poor and below expectation according to the study. Most of the staff and students in the universities only use Internet related elearning site just for the sake of finding related information for their researches, since their libraries cannot afford to provide them with adequate and current materials but not for the sake of real online learning. The study also found out that some of the universities have web page and others are in the trend of creating a web page, which is usually for advertisement of the universities but not for the e-leaning activities. Furthermore, the findings also reveal that staff and the students have also been using e-mail and Internet in addition to developing web pages for transaction of students. The Universities are planning to invest number of funds in future in the selected areas of the e-learning application. The Statistical analysis result shows that there are significant differences across both forms of e-learning activities and type of universities in Nigeria.	consciousness;email;internet;internet access;jam;library (computing);library and information science;partial template specialization;web page	Manir Abdullahi Kamba	2009	iJET	10.3991/ijet.v4i1.653	the internet;social science;knowledge management;empirical research;management;law;world wide web;pedagogy	HCI	-74.90152073386409	-26.520957498228324	80714

However, psychologists and computer scientists pursued their investigations independently from each other in the past. This project has as its main goal the support and fostering of cooperation between psychologists and computer scientists in several visualization research projects. The paper sketches the overall project. It then discusses in more detail the authors’ subproject which deals with a peer review process for animations developed by students.

This can be greatly supported by using advanced methods that are discussed in the academic literature. In order to help researchers and practitioners to select new relevant articles, we classify the recent OR planning and scheduling literature into tables using patient type, used performance measures, decisions made, OR supporting units, uncertainty, research methodology and testing phase. Additionally, we identify promising practices and trends and recognize common pitfalls when researching OR scheduling. Our findings indicate, among others, that it is often unclear whether an article mainly targets researchers and thus contributes advanced methods or targets practitioners and consequently provides managerial insights. Moreover, many performance measures (e.g., overtime) are not always used in the correct context. Furthermore, we see that important information that would allow readers to determine whether the reported research results are relevant to them is often missing. In order to avoid these pitfalls, we conclude that researchers need to state whether they target researchers or practitioners, motivate the choice of the used performance measures and mention both setting and method specific assumptions.

22fc56d62551aed0c056fcd41db20ded292e0f9c	promoting and researching adaptive regulation: new frontiers for cscl research		The last two decades have witnessed significant advances in collaborative learning, and in the range of collaborative tools and technologies available for collaborative work. Recent research has shown that succeeding in collaborative contexts requires the development and refinement of a range of regulatory skills and strategies for generating shared problem spaces, planning, monitoring, evaluating and adapting group processes. In other words, group members must develop skills for regulating themselves (self-regulation), each other (co-regulation), and together (socially shared regulation). Computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments afford opportunities to guide, support, and research regulation. This special issue presents a new generation of CSCL tools and emerging empirical research focused on supporting and examining the role/s of regulation in collaboration. Collectively papers in this special issue: (a) identify specific targets of regulation, (b) introduce tools and technologies for supporting and researching regulation, (c) present empirical findings to show how regulation emerges or influences collaboration, and (d) identify and discuss conditions under which regulation emerges (or does not emerge).

However, most of these resources either have not been digitized or are not easy to access online [1]. Consequently, scholars frequently need to spend unnecessary time and effort to find and manage different versions of materials (physical or digital) from different sources. To solve this problem, we propose an online platform called CORPUS – a Collaborative Online Research Platform for Users of Scholarly edition – to support scholarly research online in an efficient manner. CORPUS aims to integrate different types of research materials in the humanities (manuscripts, scholarly editions, online publications, and personal notes) and aggregate different versions of the same texts. In addition, it enhances collaboration among scholars while also providing them with a peer-review-based incentive to share and publish their research work.	aggregate data;human–computer interaction	Jon M.

The study examined the costs and social impacts of distributing a large body of digital images and metadata from a set of different museums to universities. Among the findings are that the digital distribution environment, as a whole, appears to be good for individual image usage, but is problematic for group viewing situations such as classrooms. Impediments to widespread adoption include: lack of comprehensive content, absence of necessary tools to facilitate use, and inadequate recognition and support for faculty who adopt new technology in their teaching. Other key issues that still need to be addressed include: integration of consortia-provided images and metadata with images acquired elsewhere; allowing instructors to change descriptive information or annotate images; encouraging the creation of added-value tools; and providing particular user interfaces or new integrated tools. The study also compared the cost of digital distribution to the costs of running an analog slide library.	site license	Howard Besser;Rosalie Lack	1999		10.1007/3-540-48155-9_3	simulation;computer science;operating system;image;higher education;user interface;metadata;world wide web;distributed computing environment	ECom	-72.8811156053339	-24.568044191835654	81832

KPE was used by engineering students in a practically oriented undergraduate engineering course. The study concentrated on students' usage and selfreported experiences of the tool, and student-adopted strategies for spatially arranging items in KPE's main knowledge space. According to the results, students used KPE mainly to share and organize project documentation. KPE appears to offer an advantage over traditional folder-based learning environments by providing a structured visual overview of the process and materials in the content view, thus facilitating pragmatic and epistemic dimensions of knowledge creation at the same time.

In our work, we’ve demonstrated that there may be learning benefits when technologies use the same non-standard dialects as students, but that educators are likely to be initially resistant to technologies that bring non-standard dialect practices into the classroom. Based on what we have uncovered about teachers’ needs and expectations regarding this type of classroom technology, our future work will investigate how systems designed to align with these needs may be able to support both students and teachers in this complex educational problem and promote a positive classroom culture.

Hence case studies are needed to inform us on the complex relationship between educational aims, technological tools and contextual features in fostering digital literacy. This contribution describes a project ran in a class of an Italian lower secondary school during a course on digital literacy. The project, realized in collaboration with the local children’s library, consisted in the digitization of a text written in late XIX century. The results highlight various educational outcome of the activity. These include both technological progresses, such as improvement of students’ digital competences and refinement of their skills in the use of a word processor, but also cultural and civic benefits, related to opportunities for reflection on the evolution of language and culture, and the sharing of the final product with a large community. The roots of this success are analyzed, in order to suggest general criteria for using digitization activities as an effective method in digital literacy education. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

There is now an increasingly accepted and used body of knowledge on the processes of design research and the components of design theories. Explicit guidance is still sparse, however, as to how to extract design theories during design science research. In this paper, we focus on reflection and abstraction in design science research as distinct activities leading to design theory. We suggest an abstraction framework that recognizes different modes of causal analysis related to the discrete decisions made by designers and developers as well as to the artifact in use: creative (mental) causes, active causes, and passive causes. The first recognizes the creativity of the human mind, the second deliberate interventions and their consequences, and the third is built upon the notion of affordances that describe the potential uses of an artifact depending on its use context. We argue that these modes of causal analysis can be used to abstract from specific design processes in order to identify key components of design theory.	causal filter;information system;mind;reflection (computer programming);sparse matrix;theory	Shirley Gregor;Oliver Müller;Stefan Seidel	2013			social science;reflection;human–computer interaction;computer science;abstraction;affordance;designtheory	HCI	-63.819865950745154	-35.36204594422047	83306

As a result, people and systems routinely make inferences about people's personal information based on their disclosed personal information. Despite the significance of this phenomenon the opportunity to make social inferences about users and how this process can be managed is poorly understood. In this paper we 1) outline why social inferences are important to study in the context of social computing applications, 2) how we can model, understand and predict social inference opportunities 3) highlight the need for social inference management systems, and 4) discuss the design space and associated research challenges. Collectively, this paper provides the first systematic overview for social inference research in the area of social computing.	personally identifiable information;social computing	Julia M.

We argue that such an analysis must focus on the product detail pages, i.e. the “deep links” to individual items, rather than the pure number of shop sites, for assessing the potential. Based on (1) a systematic analysis of the popularity of 56 software packages for e-commerce sites among the Alexa list of the one million most popular Web sites, we (2) estimate the number of product detail pages for the respective shops and then (3) project the potential lever of each ecommerce package for the adoption of structured markup, assumed that adding support for structured data can be made a readily available feature of a respective software. Our results indicate that by adding a structured markup component to as little as seven popular e-commerce systems, we could instantly deploy structured data markup on nearly 90 % of the product detail pages among the one million most popular Web sites.	data model;deep linking;e-commerce;google sites;markup language;semantic web;web search query;world wide web	Kurt Uwe Stoll;Mouzhi Ge;Martin Hepp	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-38366-3_9	knowledge management;database;world wide web	Web+IR	-70.63646529769095	-24.76139148102536	83602

We discuss how the educational practices in India differ from those that are required by MIS postgraduate programmes in the UK. Drawing on empirical work that has been conducted in India between November 2005 and January 2006, we highlight some of the key features of the Indian undergraduate education experience before suggesting that these are in contrast to those that Indian students encounter while studying at the postgraduate level in the UK. We argue that MIS programmes also pose significant challenges due to the diverse subject matter that is typically taught and assessed. Drawing on the work of Michel Foucault, we argue that education processes in both India and the UK are inextricably interlinked to claims about what constitutes legitimate knowledge and the practices that produce and reproduce such claims. Suggestions for change to MIS programmes derive from our analysis.	field research;focus group;information systems;management information system;michel hénon;subject matter expert turing test	Niall Hayes;Edgar A.

Research embraces different perspectives on how the use of Internet and Communication Technologies potentiate innovation and disruptiveness of more traditional forms of education, as well as promotion of changes in the way teachers and students work and in the roles they adopt. The present review suggests that web 2.0 technologies has promoted new forms of communication, interaction and sharing between users and content in formal education settings. Furthermore, the realization of how vast and disperse the body of literature is, revealed as significant the main goals of the project “Portuguese Public Higher Education Use of Communication Technologies”, that aims to characterize Portuguese higher education institutions according to their use and best practices, disseminating the information obtained through an online information visualization tool. The ultimate goal of the project is to contribute towards making valuable and up-to-date information available to Higher Education Institutions and users, facilitating and potentiating research in the area.	best practice;information visualization;internet;web 2.0	Marta Pinto;Francislê Neri de Souza;Fernanda Nogueira;Ana Balula;Luís Pedro;Lúcia Pombo;Fernando Ramos;António Moreira	2012			multimedia;knowledge management;computer science;higher education;tracing	HCI	-75.67626844034645	-36.72248073313919	84023

Serious Games are digital games and equipment with an agenda of educational design. The paper makes a theoretical argument for a Serious Games product based on theories of educational design and learning in relation to games. Furthermore technology based perspectives on language teaching and learning are described and in addition to this, the paper draws on data from two recent research projects that have studied the role of game based activity in children’s digitally based practices in off school contexts. This theoretical construction will be employed in the developing of the prototype of the digitally based educational platform ”Mingoville”.

Its primary aim is to facilitate the transfer of research ideas into the various product groups of the laboratory. Although we are still learning how to make CAS operate more effectively, and it is too early to assess its long-term success, the model for CAS has proved to be workable. The primary partners, namely the IBM Toronto Software Solutions Laboratory, the IBM research community, universities in North America, and government agencies that support collaborative research, have found it a viable approach. As an overview, this essay provides some background to the formation of the centre, describes some of the challenges deemed important in defining the role of the centre, identifies a number of principles that are used to guide its formation and current operation, and reports on its progress. We conclude with a discussion of some lessons learned in the operation of the centre to date and identify future activities and directions for the centre.

Although small scale rural Indian farmers possess deep knowledge about traditional agricultural practices, they oftentimes lack immediate, contextual and real time access to vital information such as the current state of the agro-market, making the right choice of pesticides and fungicides for pest management, weather conditions, and knowledge about newly introduced agricultural tools, techniques and practices. In this paper, I report the preliminary findings of an ongoing contextual user research study conducted in three different Indian villages in Maharashtra State. This research is targeted to uncover a deeper understanding of the information needs of Indian rural farmers through field observations and interviews, as well as to guide the human-centered design of potential Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions to cater to the information needs of small scale rural farmers in India.	information access;information needs;user research;user-centered design	Rajasee Rege	2009		10.1145/1520340.1520486	information needs;information and communications technology;user-centered design;human–computer interaction;computer science;interaction design;integrated pest management;rural management;sustainability;rural area	HCI	-72.83848814178734	-31.640255462907106	84356

In the case of privacy, it is especially important to develop pedagogical material that can be used by all domains of higher education -- even those who traditionally do not cover topics related to technology or privacy. Given its multidimensional aspects and broad coverage, privacy is a complex subject to study, and especially difficult for students to master using the standard pedagogical techniques. In this paper, we propose the use of an interactive approach to teaching privacy. The primary tools used are that of case studies and gaming scenarios. We propose the development of a suite of case studies and scenarios that teach foundational privacy topics to students. The case studies should be designed to present privacy concepts in a manner that makes them accessible to a variety of disciplines of study while still lecturing on the core privacy topics. We believe this method will achieve a high level of success in raising awareness of these important issues and promoting safe and secure use of technology in society.	high-level programming language;internet;privacy	Jaideep Vaidya;David Lorenzi;Basit Shafiq;Soon Ae Chun;Nazia Badar	2014		10.1145/2670739.2670751	privacy software;simulation;privacy by design;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;privacy;computer security	HCI	-68.5775969661829	-32.563043421516575	84931

Starting from a socio-constructivist and situated learning perspective, we acknowledge the crucial role of context in accessing knowledge. Then we point out the potential of narrative in education and discuss the positive role it can play in the creation of meaningful learning contexts. To this end, we focus on different examples of narrative contexts within technology-enhanced learning environments, drawn from the literature. We analyze what kind of contexts raise from different ways to set up narrative activities. Our study points out that narrative can be a powerful tool for the creation of a variety of contexts suitable for different learning situations, by stimulating learners’ direct involvement and offering a concrete starting point	situated	Giuliana Dettori;Francesca Morselli	2008		10.1007/978-0-387-09729-9_39	situated learning;natural language processing;professional learning community;cooperative learning;educational technology;social learning;team learning;blended learning;computer science;knowledge management;experiential learning;learning theory;learning sciences;multimedia;active learning;synchronous learning	HCI	-74.01763975792106	-37.62581689500326	85084

The impact of the IT industry and the relationship with other professions will be taken into account in defining the professional model for IT.#R##N# The main beneficiaries of the research will be those organisation and institutions interested in growing and cultivating the IT profession. The beneficiaries of the research will be:#R##N#•#TAB#Computer Societies#R##N#There are many IT organisations working to represent the interest of IT professionals in each country. This research will help identify the differences between them and the elements of a professional body. It may well be that these organisations are the vehicle through which improvements can be made towards creating an IT profession.  #R##N#•#TAB#IT Industry#R##N#Companies (e.g. IBM) which have a vested interest in attracting, recruiting, motivating and retaining IT staff.  It is also of key interest to them that their staff are well qualified, professional and works in an ethical manner. The increased attractiveness of IT as a career will benefit them while the improved standing of the profession within the society will help grow their business#R##N#•#TAB#Academic Institutions#R##N#Academic Institutions play a key role in the development of the next generation of IT professionals and hence will benefit from any recommendations from this project that will improve the level of professionalism. These recommendations may be applicable to the designers of future IT educational material, structure and content.#R##N#•#TAB#The State and Regulatory Bodies#R##N#All professionals operate within the boundaries conferred on them by the state and regulatory bodies.  Throughout this research recommendations may be identified that suggest changes to the relationship between the State and IT Professional organisations.#R##N#•#TAB#IT Professionals#R##N#Many of the changes required to improve the IT Profession come from the IT Professionals themselves. Its members must want to make the changes and be willing to take action to make the changes happen.  How individual professionals act will have a big impact on the image of the profession as a whole.#R##N#While developing the research proposal, I have had informal conversations with a number of stakeholders:#R##N#•#TAB#Colleagues and members of the IT profession.  The general consensus was that the IT profession had grown very fast over the last 20 years and is probably now entering a maturing phase.  There was a feeling that the timing is right now in defining the future shape of the profession.#R##N#•#TAB#IT recruitment. The sharp decline in the number of IT students selecting IT as university courses is a concern for most societies. The apparent contradiction of skills shortages and lack of interest in IT needs to be addressed.  It was felt that the unstructured nature of the profession coupled with poor image problems contributes to the decline of interest in IT.   A strong professional body for IT would help address this.#R##N#•#TAB#IBM Management#R##N#Like the rest of the IT industry, IBM is facing the same challenges of recruiting, retaining and motivating IT staff.   This project is in support of IBM’s interest and other initiatives in this area.#R##N#•#TAB#Council of European Professional Informatics Societies (CEPIS)#R##N#CEPIS is an umbrella organisation representing Computer Societies in the majority of European counties.  Following discussions with senior officers of this organisation they confirmed that they had identified the area of professionalism within the IT industry as one of their top focus areas. They were excited about my area of research and offered their endorsement when contacting the various Computer Societies.#R##N#In general, there was consensus regarding the aims of the project and its timing from the main interested stakeholders of this research.

In order to grasp a vivid portrait of the so-called “Hakka Mother”, a series of courses that allow every student to revisit the life stories of mothers are proposed. This investigation explores the life stories in two different scopes: the food habit and dressing style. Throughout the dialogues among children and mothers, the life stories embedded in those two scopes have been discovered and the parent-child relationship of each family has been revealed. The results are archived on a social network platform called Ning which enables the Web 2.0 interactions and sharing processes among different users at different platforms such as Facebook and Youtube. This feature enhances the understanding of the cultural aspect of Hakka mothers and invites more people to care about the life story and to contribute their own stories in a similar manner on the social networks.	archive;embedded system;interaction;social network;web 2.0;world wide web	Hung-Cheng Chen;Eric Zhi-Feng Liu;Sheng-Yi Wu;Chin-Yu Lin	2011	IJOPCD	10.4018/ijopcd.2011040106	humanities;engineering;multimedia;communication	HCI	-67.19652112068462	-33.88356348212867	86131

Research suggests that job seekers with limited access to Internet technologies are being left behind, while those with limited social resources are expected to rely on the Internet even more. In this work, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 11 low-resourced job seekers in a metropolitan area in the Midwestern USA to understand how social and digital resources support their efforts to find work. We find that online resources support job seekers in finding relevant jobs via search, but do not help them identify opportunities to improve their job search process or increase their chances of securing employment. We recommend that systems aiming to support low-resourced job seekers design for deeper engagement with their users across the job search process, to help users recognize ways to improve on their existing practices.	freedom of information laws by country;internet;job stream;semiconductor industry	Earnest Wheeler;Tawanna Dillahunt	2018		10.1145/3173574.3173622	multimedia;leverage (finance);digital divide;seekers;the internet;marketing;computer science;information seeking	HCI	-73.62153977631804	-27.622169136793218	86267

Starting from the basic assumption that an e-learning course is really inclusive when accessibility is addressed both technically and pedagogically, this research has the purpose to examine methods, tools and practices to propose a reference model for designing accessible e-learning courses in the higher education context.	accessibility;reference model;technical standard	Eleonora Guglielman	2010			knowledge management;business;higher education;reference model;technical standard	HCI	-76.72927314741979	-36.25622563290857	86535
491f0387ac5f47fe2dc2628b104340376bcd12aa	computational collective intelligence		Although many powerful applications are able to locate vast amounts of digital information, effective tools for selecting, structuring, personalizing, and making sense of the digital resources available to us are lacking. As a result, the opportunities to connect and empower knowledge workers are severely limited. In recognizing these constraints, predictions of the ‘Next Knowledge Management (KM) Generation’ focus on nurturing personal and social settings and on utilizing existing and creating new knowledge. Levy even envisages a decentralizing KM revolution that gives more power and autonomy to individuals and self-organized groups. But, such promising scenarios have not materialized yet. It might be time to follow Pollard’s suggestion of going back to the original premise and promise of KM and start again but this time from the bottom up by developing processes, programs, and tools to improve knowledge workers’ effec‐ tiveness and sense-making. As part of an ongoing design science research (DSR) project, this paper contributes to prior publications by synthesizing renowned computer-based methods of collective intelligence to provide a visual metaperspective of a novel personal knowledge management (PKM) concept and prototype application. In focusing on time, space, and causality, the bottom-up approach taken, pictures the relevant personal and organizational knowledge spaces as a substitute for the intangible KM territory and provides a guiding map for knowledge workers and KM education.	ansi escape code;causality;collective intelligence;computation;digital data;knowledge space;personal knowledge management;prototype;self-organization;sensemaking;top-down and bottom-up design	Ngoc Thanh Nguyen;Bogdan Trawinski;Gottfried Vossen	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67074-4		AI	-71.76047460641702	-25.819788822530796	86552
361994b310d314cf29608ea3414e1117c54ee532	introduction to computing with social trust		The Web is deep into its second decade of life, and since 1991 it has dramatically changed the way the connected world operates. As the Web has shifted to an interactive environment where much content is created by users, the question of whom to trust and what information to trust has become both more important and more difficult to answer. One promising solution is using social trust relationships. In this book, we examine challenging research problems on computing with social trust, including the computation of trust relationships and the use of these relationships in applications.	computation;information;world wide web	Jennifer Golbeck	2009		10.1007/978-1-84800-356-9_1	public relations;knowledge management;computational trust	Web+IR	-63.59876855508644	-27.328939782027888	86604
a6f378c1c58535466c5269559a8f335a0cdf36df	awareness is not enough: pitfalls of learning analytics dashboards in the educational practice		It has been long argued that learning analytics has the potential to act as a “middle space” between the learning sciences and data analytics, creating technical possibilities for exploring the vast amount of data generated in online learning environments. One common learning analytics intervention is the learning dashboard, a support tool for teachers and learners alike that allows them to gain insight into the learning process. Although several related works have scrutinised the state-of-the-art in the field of learning dashboards, none have addressed the theoretical foundation that should inform the design of such interventions. In this systematic literature review, we analyse the extent to which theories and models from learning sciences have been integrated into the development of learning dashboards aimed at learners. Our critical examination reveals the most common educational concepts and the context in which they have been applied. We find evidence that current designs foster competition between learners rather than knowledge mastery, offering misguided frames of reference for comparison.

This article describes an exploratory study of the massively multiplayer online game (MMO) World of Warcraft (WoW), with specific attention to its qualities as a setting for second language (L2) use and development. This empirical study seeks to answer the following question: What is the nature of the linguistic ecology that WoW players are exposed to? Many studies have described the developmental opportunities presented by commercially available gaming environments (e.g., Gee, 2003, 2007), their value as sites of literacy development (e.g., Squire, 2008a; Steinkuehler, 2008), and their potential as venues for second language (L2) use and learning (e.g., Peterson, 2010; Thorne, Black, & Sykes, 2009; Thorne & Fischer, 2012; Zheng, Young, Wagner & Brewer, 2009). There are, however, numerous outstanding questions regarding the quality and complexity of the linguistic environments associated with online commercially available games. This primarily descriptive research addresses this issue and aims to finely characterize the linguistic complexity of game-presented texts (or ‘quest texts’) as well as player generated game-external informational and strategy websites that form the expansive semiotic ecology of WoW game play. Questionnaires and interviews with Dutch and American gamers helped to identify a variety of widely used game-external websites. This information then informed the selection of texts that were analyzed for their linguistic complexity. By analysing the linguistic complexity of the texts that players regularly engage with, this study aims to empirically assess the resources and limitations of a representative and widely played MMO as an environment for L2 development.	adaptive system;bottom-up parsing;bruce ellis;causality;complexity;dynamical systems theory;ecology;event-driven programming;existential quantification;fractional quantum hall effect;lawrence a. hyland;list comprehension;massively multiplayer online role-playing game;michael j. fischer;natural language processing;peterson's algorithm;problem solving;recall;real-time transcription;schmitt trigger;semiotics;situated;socialization;virtual world;vocabulary;world of warcraft	Steven L.

aa93d568549a3b4f9f27aebff76e4869b4072cd9	empowering students in the process of social inquiry learning through flipping the classroom		The flipped classroom is an educational strategy about inverting the traditional use of in-class time for conducting lower-level learning activities and out-of-class time for conducting higher-level learning activities. Guided social inquiry learning (GSIL), which is a scaffolded constructivist pedagogic approach, has been conventionally adopted in learning and teaching of Liberal Studies (a “young” core senior secondary subject of social and humanities education in Hong Kong). In this research, we aimed to integrate the idea of the flipped classroom into the process of GSIL for promoting students’ learning achievement and self-efficacy in studying Liberal Studies. Apart from delineating the pedagogic design of the proposed “flipped” social inquiry learning (FSIL) approach, this paper also reports our quasiexperimental study on investigating the pedagogic effectiveness of FSIL in comparison with GSIL. There was a total of 215 Grade-11 students from top, middle, and bottom academic-banding schools participating in this study. Results indicated that, compared to the conventional approach, FSIL had different degrees of positive effects on the high, moderate, and low academic-achieving participants. The findings provide grounds for further studying a wider adoption of the flipped classroom in social and humanities education, as well as in constructivist learning and teaching activities.	colour banding;computer;entity–relationship model;experiment;google classroom;hoc (programming language);mobile device;niche blogging;non-convexity (economics);programming paradigm;video clip;wallace tree;word lists by frequency	Morris Siu Yung Jong	2017	Educational Technology & Society		psychology;mathematics education;social science;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;sociology;active learning;management;pedagogy	HCI	-73.9491703068894	-34.83942633173332	87115

Constructivist learning theories advertise active involvement of learners as a key requirement for successful teaching. Analogously, we argue that active involvement of readers can facilitate the process of conveying scientific research to other scholars. Today’s web technologies provide plenty of opportunities to generate interactive content. However, almost no attempts to explore these opportunities have been undertaken so far. Step by step, we discuss learning theory to demonstrate the importance of actively involving the reader. Then, we show how interactive web technology and visual media can be used to realize this involvement. By subsequently showcasing an original research result from the area of business process mining in an interactive fashion, we invite the reader to experience himself what an interactive research papers can look like. Furthermore, brief sketches of technical realization are included to encourage readers to engage in their own online publication projects.	algorithm;applet;business process;content management system;experiment;formal proof;graphical user interface;hoc (programming language);information systems;interactivity;microsoft outlook for mac;norm (social);scientific literature;statistical learning theory;web content;web development	Jörg Becker;Philipp Bergener;Dominic Breuker;Tobias Heide	2012			computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;marketing;database;multimedia;management;world wide web	HCI	-67.3973552776855	-37.14108636388801	87583

Increasingly there is a need to collect, retrieve and use health record information in an electronic format to provide greater flexibility, as this enables retrieval and display of data in multiple locations and formats irrespective of where the data were collected. Electronically maintained records require greater structure and consistency to achieve this. The use of data held in records generated in real time in clinical systems also has the potential to reduce the time it takes to gain knowledge, as there is less need to collect research specific information, this is only possible if data governance principles are applied. Connected devices and information systems are now generating huge amounts of data, as never before seen. An ability to analyse and mine very large amounts of data, """"Big Data"""", provides policy and decision makers with new insights into varied aspects of work and information flow and operational business patterns and trends, and drives greater efficiencies, and safer and more effective health care. This enables decision makers to apply rules and guidance that have been developed based upon knowledge from many individual patient records through recognition of triggers based upon that knowledge. In clinical decision support systems information about the individual is compared to rules based upon knowledge gained from accumulated information of many to provide guidance at appropriate times in the clinical process. To achieve this the data in the individual system, and the knowledge rules must be represented in a compatible and consistent manner. This chapter describes data attributes; explains the difference between data and information; outlines the requirements for quality data; shows the relevance of health data standards; and describes how data governance impacts representation of content in systems and the use of that information."""	big data;clinical decision support system;data governance;database trigger;decision support systems, clinical;etoposide/ifosfamide/mesna/mitoxantrone;funding;gain;information systems;information retrieval;information system;intrinsic drive;outlines (document);patients;precipitating factors;relevance;requirement;rule (guideline);format;health records;standards characteristics	Evelyn J.

Literature has analysed in depth the role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in education [Angehern, Thierry, 1996; Jonassen, 1993, Leidner, Jarvenpaa, 1995], mainly emphasising their positive or negative effects [Bowers, 1988, Van Baalen, 1999]. However few has been written about multimedia case studies and still few cases are on the market, because of both the development costs (in financial and time terms) and the immaturity of the demand. Sponsored by the European Commission, the consortium Busines-Linc has the development of 18 multimedia case studies as main objective. Pre-requisite for the case design and development was the analysis of literature about teaching and ICT in order to define a theoretical framework for multimedia case development. One key assumption leading the project is consistentwith the so called interpretive -hermeutic approach (Lee, 1994;Van Baalen, 1999) of ICT in education: technology per se is neither good nor bad in education; its use might produce positive or negative effects depending on the consistency with the learning and teaching objectives and on the interaction with the environment. After a short overview of contributions about learning processes in management education, the paper affords the relations between ICT and teaching approaches and it describes in more detail the role of case studies. Using the Sogema case experience, the authors will discuss similarities and differences in the deve lopment process of traditional and multimedia case studies and will present some first results from its use in MBA classes. Obviously generalisations are not possible given the limited research sample but some warnings and suggestions might be useful for all researchers working in this rapidly evolving field.	experience;linc	Paola Bielli;Stefano Basaglia	2000			information and communications technology;educational technology;knowledge management;teaching and learning center;open learning	HCI	-76.08739072958984	-33.83194553600217	87949

However, it appears beneficial to address underlying roles, align design processes on school activities or give considerations to the voluntary nature of such projects. We conducted eight projects with 75 pupils using initial learning environments. We found that starting design processes with pupils as users helps to identify further design steps that can be consequently tackled with the former users as informants and design partners. Thus, we suggest the Avalanche Design Cycle to engage children as fresh users at several stages asking them to become informants and design partners consecutively. The Avalanche Design Cycle is an iterative design process complying with school life allowing pupils to join/leave design teams. Thereby, it is aiming at sustained team sizes and more representative groups.	align (company);interaction design;iteration;iterative design	Timo Göttel	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40477-1_45	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;interaction design	HCI	-64.982979610428	-37.529398737643035	88526

Using ethnography-based approach, we studied five continuous professional development pilot trainings where learning largely took place at workplace through wikis, blogs, forums, chats and voice conferencing. Learners valued interactivity, peer support and abundant, instant feedback offered by synchronous features. Simultaneously, however, asynchronous features were often treated as chores and overall interactive learning culture failed to emerge. Instructors, while explicitly encouraging social learning approach, implicitly reinforced teacher-centered learning, leading learners to stick to conventional learning culture. Also, training designs often failed to engender interaction. Moreover, at general level, group sizes were too big, moderation was not used efficiently, and differing skill sets of learners were not evened out. The lessons learned from these trainings offer us insight into how to design e-learning enhanced with social media and how to avoid potential pitfalls. Particularly, we discuss designing interactivity into the e-learning process.	blog;capacitor plague;collaborative product development;interactivity;relevance;social media;synergetics (haken);wiki	Juha Leino;Erika Tanhua-Piiroinen;Johanna Sommers-Piiroinen	2012	iJAC		social learning;simulation;social media;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;management;world wide web;pedagogy	HCI	-74.55545953687125	-37.55888713640959	88584
6f292fa034eb7ae1a85464c552cdca6c3e310a85	the appointment scheduling game	advance patient scheduling;teaching healthcare operations;classroom games	This paper describes the appointment scheduling game ASG, an easy to use teaching tool that reveals the challenges in managing advance patient scheduling systems, and also provides an introduction to simulation and decision analysis. In addition to describing the game, the paper provides recommendations on how to play it, student questions and suggested answers, and a Markov decision process MDP formulation. The ASG simulates a system in which daily patient appointment requests, which are characterized by their urgency level, arrive randomly. Daily service capacity is limited. Students playing the game assume the role of a scheduling clerk who must assign appointment dates to these requests without knowing future demand. They are left to discover the need for performance metrics, data collection, and strategy formulation. An attractive feature of the game is that it requires only a printed one-month calendar, multicolored poker chips, and a standard six-sided die. Although the game is primarily aimed at undergraduate and graduate operations students, it also can be used to introduce a range of MDP concepts to advanced operations research students. The game has been used successfully in several courses at the University of British Columbia including “Managing Health Care System Operations” MBA, “Managing Patient Flow” executive MBA in healthcare and “Logistics and Operations Management” undergraduate. It has also been used by colleagues at the University of Ottawa, McGill University, and the University of Michigan.	schedule (project management);simulation	Antoine Sauré;Martin L.

37323d850e3b1ecd865d5b14656f2aaf6dd3942c	an analysis of internet services in portuguese public libraries		This paper aims at describing the today’s reality of 20 school libraries (SL) belonging to Portuguese public basic integrated schools (Escolas Básicas Integradas, EBIs), which were in the school libraries network (Rede de Bibliotecas Escolares, RBE) till 2005, in terms of their human resources, clients, physical space, books and other materials’ collection and some ongoing activities. This paper is based on the field notes analysis and non-participant direct observation that took place at 20 SL during November and December 2006 and January 2007. This was the 2 phase, out of four, of a PhD program research for which was adopted a qualitative methodology both for data gathering and analysis techniques. In this sense, the majority of data were obtained through semi-structured interviews and field notes taken during about 4 hours of non participant direct observation to selected respondents. By the end of this research phase it was found that the most significant element in bring about improvements was the commitment and support of the school’s management board. Nevertheless, school libraries with more students coming in, more activities, larger and catalogued/classified book stock, more equipment and with better physical space, have team members with adequate training for the development of their tasks and roles. Recommendations/suggestions are given both to school management boards and the ones responsible for the development of school libraries in schools, the RBE and the regional education authorities, aiming at placing school libraries on the top educational priorities, therefore recognizing them as an important point of access to information for everyone. Introduction The Portuguese school libraries network (RBE) has commemorated its 10 anniversary in 2006. Started back in 1996/1997 academic year, this network was essential for Portuguese school libraries (SL) existence, organization and development. The RBE program was able to equip till November 2007, 1880 school libraries with technological infra-structures aiming at satisfying information needs of its educational community and turning them into spaces where students learn how to learn and inform themselves continuously through out their lives. This program’s other objective was the training of human resources allocated to SL. However, this objective has not yet been fully accomplished, as there is still a limited number of teachers with specific training to perform their duties in the SL and a third of the teams responsible for these libraries’ do not have a single teacher with specific training (Novo, 2006). Are Portuguese School Libraries Providing Access to Information for Everyone? 31 BOBCATSSS 2008 Methodology This research work, belonging to a PhD program, is focused on SL of Portuguese basic integrated schools (EBIs), which were till 2005 already in the RBE. This research makes use of qualitative methodology either for data gathering and analysis techniques. Qualitative methodologies have been frequently referred (Bogdan & Biklen, 1994) as being particularly suitable for library and information studies research. Therefore, the majority of data was obtained through semi-structured interviews and field notes resulting from non-participant direct observation to selected respondents. Field notes have, most of the times, descriptive parts and reflection parts. Descriptive parts are as much specific as possible and include subjects’ pictures, dialogue’s reconstruction, space’s descriptions, particular facts’ reports, description of activities and observer’s behaviour. On the other hand, reflection parts are, in their majority, speculations and include reflections about the analysis, conflicts and dilemmas, the observer’s point of view and facts needing some clarification. Map 1 Portugal regional educational authorities. This research work is divided into several phases. In the first one (concluded), questionnaires were sent, by mail, to the teachers responsible for the 57 SL of EBIs, belonging to the RBE till 2005. This questionnaire was asking for factual information on human resources and equipment. The analysis of the 41 returned completed questionnaires (72 %), allowed, in a second phase (also concluded), the selection of 20 SL following the maximum diversity criteria: teacher / team specific training, SL characteristics, EBI’s characteristics and geographical location.

And to help these governmental bodies in managing this kind of situation, we used the concept of collaborative computing, to introduce an approach for mobiles to collaborate in order to act as helper agents for other ones with limited resources. Our approach is called the Disaster Pool. And in this paper we highlighted the importance of collaborative computing, have a quick look on previous work, and discuss our approach and the implemented code.	computation;computer science;management system;privacy	Hamid Mcheick;Raef Mousheimish;Ali Masri;Youssef Dergham	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07788-8_41	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;operations research	PL	-63.87673246825301	-29.106807450726855	88932

The concepts originated from architecture and urban design, where they are used both to distinguish static spaces from inhabited places, and more importantly, as design objectives. The transformation from space to place is supported and enabled by social interactions between the (learning) community members. We argue that this distinction between the concepts explains some of the problems with current e-learning systems and propose issues to consider when designing new systems. By acknowledging the importance and characteristics of a place, designers and researchers can justify the need and support for social interactions in learning space, consequently enabling social community building in e-learning environments, and most importantly, supporting the development of a user-friendly and motivating e-learning place. Introduction Until today, the evolution of virtual learning environments, ie, virtual spaces for learning, can be seen to consist of two phases (Bower & Hardy, 2004). First, they were descendants of correspondence schools where the distribution of learning materials (eg, letters) was managed by teachers, institutions or companies. This enabled wider interaction as the learners over the distances were more reachable. In the second phase, approximately in the 1960s, the idea of online virtual space emerged following the rapid development of computer technology. This space was designed to support interaction and learning, and to include all the necessary materials for a course or a topic. The e-learning environment was perceived as an artificial artefact between learners and instructors, developed to frame and support interaction. Today, e-learning environments are exploited to promote personal and organisational development and learning. Examples include military training and higher education, among many others (eg, Fisher & Peratino, 2001; Leinonen & Järvelä, 2006; Pöysä, Lowyck & Häkkinen, 2005). British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 39 No 6 2008 1020–1030 doi:10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00821_1.x © 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation © Becta 2008. Published by Blackwell Publishing, 9600 Garsington Road, Oxford OX4 2DQ, UK and 350 Main Street, Malden, MA 02148, USA. In particular, e-learning environments provide platforms that facilitate learning through communication that does not require face-to-face contacts or physical presence in the same space or at the same moment of time. Currently, despite multiple definitions and approaches to e-learning environments (eg, Tsai & Machado, 2002), they are often conceived as common information spaces, accessible through an interface constructed on a technological system. In this context, the concept of space is emphasised (eg, Peters, 1999a, b). In our belief, this focus on spaces explains some of the following challenges associated with e-learning, such as the poverty of pedagogies and the unattractive and non-compelling learning materials; impersonal teaching; lack of tools to measure or to evaluate the learning outcomes; restricted or limited interactions; lack of consistency between materials; preparation time; heavy investment for institutions and organisations; and usability issues (eg, Ardito et al, 2004). Kendall (2002) argued that members of online communities and virtual environments have ‘intact social systems, and highly charged social relations’. She concluded that the online community members feel that when connecting to an online forum, they enter a social place, not a physical space. In other words, the focus on a physical construction, a space, does not correspond with the users’ mental models (Wilson, 1996). The distinction between physical space and social place is brought into relief. These contradictions also have their consequences on learning environments, as learning results are dependent on both places and spaces. Traditional learning spaces (eg, the classroom) provide tools and structures for learning periods (eg, books and teaching), but they also enable the learner to become receptive and mentally ‘tune his/her brain’ for learning. Hence, in the e-learning context, an implicit perception of the learning place should support the learner in achieving understanding of the settings and the context by providing means to observe appropriate behaviour and interaction. The focus on static spaces is not adequate as learning is usually an interactive and dynamic process. As a result, the design of learning environments should not be towards spaces for learning, but towards interactive, social places where learning takes place through social interaction (Mäkitalo, 2006). We argue that the third phase of the e-learning environments’ evolution is currently emerging. This paper’s focus is on the e-learning environments supporting the sense of place and the transition from space to place. We argue that currently e-learning environments are more like ‘buildings’, ie, learning spaces, rather than ‘schools’, ie, learning places where people optimistically enjoy spending time to learn. Current e-learning environments are more like windows, where one can peek into a shared information space, or which, in the worst cases, may alienate possible inhabitants (O’Neill, 2005). We will discuss different prerequisites, preconditions and methods to support the transformation from space to place. Although we acknowledge the importance and influence of social–political interactions within the design process, we do not focus on them. Instead, our aim is to shed light on the change of design focus when designing From e-learning space to e-learning place 1021 © 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation © Becta 2008. e-learning environments. We argue that by creating an e-learning environment as a place for learning, there is a need to design support for different kinds of social interactions within the environment, in a similar manner to architects inhibiting physical spaces. By shifting the design focus to social interaction, e-learning environments adopt environmental and social characteristics and become more like places of learning—but still without physical restrictions. Space–place relationship The concept of place originates from architecture and urban design, where it gives meanings to three-dimensional structures, referred to as spaces. The relationship between space and place is social: spaces are converted to places by people, their interpretation of a space and their social interactions (Harrison & Dourish, 1996). Place is consequently a space with meaning, and that meaning can be private or socially shared. Placeness is constructed through experiences, interaction with the place and social interaction with other people. The distinction is similar to that between a ‘house’ and a ‘home’: a house keeps out the wind and rain, but a home is where we live. Harrison and Dourish (1996) introduced the distinction between space and place to the computerised environment (their original words in italics): Physically, a place is a space which is invested with understandings of behavioural appropriateness, cultural expectations, and so forth. We are located in ‘space’, but we act in ‘place’. Furthermore, ‘places’ are spaces that are valued (Harrison and Dourish 1996, p. 69). A physical location, a space, starts to function differently when interpretations and expectations concerning that space evolve in the minds of its users. Conversely, two spaces may share similar spatial features but are still perceived as very different places as the users’ (people’s) behaviour is adjusted accordingly. For example, a conference hall and a theatre share similar spatial features (such as lighting and orientation), but we understand their different functions as places. It is place, not space, that frames appropriate behaviour (Harrison & Dourish, 1996). Alexander (1979) comments that ‘those of us who are concerned with building tend to forget too easily that all the life and soul of a place, all of our experiences there, depend not simply on the physical environment, but on the pattern of events which we experience there’. This is acknowledged especially in city planning. For example, when (re-)designing the grid plan for Jyväskylä city, certain areas (eg, town squares) were intended for public use while the others were private spaces (Jäppinen, 2005). These objectives were deliberately considered in the design: public spaces to attract people and to provide a feeling that it is socially acceptable to be there, and private spaces to provide certain privacy and a feeling of intimacy. The issue of ‘acting in the place’ was brought into the context of group work applications by Harrison and Dourish (1996). They discussed spaces and places in media spaces, experimental audio–video systems, and came to the conclusion that as placeness is created and maintained by the acts of use, it is something that cannot be 1022 British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 39 No 6 2008 © 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation © Becta 2008. designed in. However, similarly to architects and urban designers, there is something that needs to be supported. Thus, understanding the differences between space and place helps not only the designers of buildings and milieus, but also the designers of computer applications, eg, e-learning environments. The relationship between space and place is social, not technological (Harrison & Dourish, 1996). Different technologies construct new social places according to the ascriptions of social meanings of new technological features. For instance, similarly to conference halls and theatres, different Usenet news groups have dissimilar social protocols. Correspondingly, each newsgroup is also a place. The difference in a conference hall is the notion of space. A conference hall is a physical space, while th	blackwell (series);book;compiler;computer architecture;emoticon;eurographics;experience;geforce 9 series;hall effect sensor;interaction;media space;mental model;microsoft windows;norm (social);online community;precondition;privacy;social system;usability;usenet;virtual reality;word lists by frequency	Ari Wahlstedt;Samuli Pekkola;Marketta Niemelä	2008	BJET	10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00821_1.x	psychology;distance education;social environment;design;interpersonal relationship;educational technology;social learning;knowledge management;instructional simulation;learning sciences;instructional design;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-73.10153255366042	-31.077002692370666	89057

In a bigger system, part of the things that will be represented in the life course is the Model, like the research process, through a chain of sequentially interconnected stages or phases in which information is manipulated or produced. This paper presents and discusses methods and ways in which the life cycle approach offers insight into the relationships among the stages and activities in research, especially in the field of technology evolution, like e-Science. And this paper will also present an idea and concept how this research life cycle in e-Science will affect the Philippine community. An understanding of this viewpoint may contribute further insight into the function of e-science in the larger picture of methodical and scientific research.

The language classroom is evolving to integrate computer-mediated learning and communication with traditional schooling; digitization and the Internet mean the textbook is evolving from inert hard copy that is consumed, to dynamic e-texts that students participate in. The emergence of English as a Global Language, with the primary role of English on the Internet, means that the transition from fixed hard copy to fluid online digital environment is particularly evident in EFL/ESL. I review research, trace ways in which this transition occurs, and speculate on how, under the impact of ICTs and their convergence, the EFL/ESL textbook will reform, and may even disappear as a stand-alone entity.	digital environment;emergence;english in computing;enlightenment foundation libraries;internet	Robert C.

The author draws on interview data collected from video game developers, content analysis of several long-running video game series, as well as the projectâ€™s advisory board and researcher reports. This paper exposes two fundamental challenges in creating metrics and specifications for the preservation of virtual worlds; namely, that there is no one type of user or designated video game stakeholder community, and that significant properties of games cannot always be located in code or platform. The PVWII data serve to explain why existing ideas about preservation of video games are inadequate when games are treated as digital cultural heritage. Preservation specialists need to bind nebulous and dynamic digital objects, a process that is necessary while inherently artificial.

In this paper, we seek to contribute to an understanding of how digital systems might support valuable unpredictability in innovation processes by examining how innovators who obtain value from accidents integrate unpredictability into their work. We describe an inductive, grounded theory project, based on 20 case studies, that looks into the conditions under which people who make things keep their work open to accident, the degree to which they rely on accidents in their work, and how they incorporate accidents into their deliberate processes and arranged surroundings. By comparing makers working in varied conditions, we identify specific factors (e.g., technologies, characteristics of technologies) that appear to support accidental innovation. We show that makers in certain specified conditions not only remain open to accident but also intentionally design their processes and surroundings to invite and exploit valuable accidents. Based on these findings, we offer advice for the design of digital systems to support innovation processes that can access valuable unpredictability.	accident (philosophy)	Robert D.

A work analysis framework has been established which gets around some of the difficulties found in using cognitive work analysis, and allows structured investigation at the environment, domain, activity, scenario and expertise levels. Within this major research programme a video ethnography study was carried out to explore the work and work systems of the rail controllers in more detail, with specific reference to social interactions. Discussion centres around the strategies, communications, social relationships, learning and development and inter-team differences that were identified in the video ethnography.	cognitive work analysis;colocation centre;control engineering;interaction;job design;organizational behavior;situated;user story;work systems	Trudi Farrington-Darby;John R.

A qualitative methodology explored stakeholder opinions on the remit, marketing, resourcing and measurement of the service. A questionnaire and interviews gathered experiences of personalised provision across the government sector. Potential users were similarly surveyed to discuss how the service could meet their needs. Data were analysed using coding techniques to identify emerging theory. Lessons learned from government librarians centred on clarifying requirements, balancing workloads and selective marketing. The user survey showed low usage and awareness of existing specialist services, but high levels of need and interest in services repackaged as a tailored offering. Fieldwork confirmed findings from the literature on the scope for adding value through information management advice, information skills training and substantive research assistance and the need to understand business processes and develop effective partnerships. Concluding recommendations focus on service definition, strategic marketing, resource utilisation and performance measurement.	business process;computer programming;data compression;experience;field research;information management;librarian;requirement	Katherine Taylor;Sheila Corrall	2007	J.

a92ab24b06c6588222eae2ca27a54a9cc11ba3a4	mood: massive open online deliberation platform - a practical application		Nowadays, public debates often take place on social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter and can be characterized as asynchronous, protracted and ill-structured. The Massive Open Online Deliberation (MOOD) platform aims to structure these debates. Essential is that the platform can differentiate between the moral acceptability and the social acceptance of a debate outcome. We briefly describe the e-deliberation process and look at two existing debate platforms, Liquidfeedback and Debatehub. We design and build a prototype that mainly focuses on: (1) a method to differentiate and validate facts and opinions, and (2) a mechanism that maps both the social acceptance and the moral acceptability of debate outcomes. We research these ethical concepts more in depth and implement several techniques, such as a voting mechanism, in a working prototype that supports a four stage deliberation process. In future applications, machine learning techniques can be integrated in the platform to perform sentiment analysis on a debate.	machine learning;map;moral hazard;prototype;sentiment analysis;social media	Ilse Verdiesen;Martijn Cligge;Jan Timmermans;Lennard Segers;Virginia Dignum;Jeroen van den Hoven	2016			sentiment analysis;mood;world wide web;voting;asynchronous communication;social media;online deliberation;engineering;deliberation	Web+IR	-64.99279968001677	-31.044968236998134	90420

This paper focuses on recent work at LBS concerning a Masters module that has had its VLE support progressively developed since 1998. Module delivery is flexible in that it is variably credit rated and can be studied in full-time, part-time and distance modes. The approach used in the delivery of the module has facilitated the examination of module/programme support development possibilities on the web from academic, quality and commercial perspectives as well as the cybernetic and evolutionary nature of learning. In 2001 a commercial VLE, Blackboard, replaced the previous VLE (designed by academics). A feedback model is developed here to inform the evolved development of student support web-sites. An exploration of student attitudes and perceptions to the evolved new technology and factors related to the learning strategies adopted by students and student learning styles have been used to inform an over-pinning LBS and university strategy of a web supported teaching and learning environments.	cybernetics;http public key pinning;liverpool;location-based service	Robert J.

Although a variety of standardization and Learning Management System (LMS) were produced to develop and effectively manage web contents in response to active diffusion of internet application, practical changes to assist online learners are not yet to be found. In this paper, I would like to introduce a LMS that can support self-leading education by providing various types of learners at Virtual University with delicately organized educational contents for maximum efficiency. The system allows a learner to select a lecture or a chapter which has been presorted to meet his educational needs and intellectual ability. In general, most LMSs cannot meet every individual's educational needs because they structure their programs by letting learners simply choose from a list of available lectures at prescribed level or difficulty. However the Self-Leading LMS eliminates such boundaries by allowing learners to choose contents and difficulty within the limit set by their own educational competence.

The expansion of computer use in modem societies led to the appew ante and rapid expansion of CS departments in many educational iustitutiona to meet the growing demand for computer professionals. The need for guidelines to govern the creation of the new CS progmma was Wwnt. %verd attempts to design models for CS graduate and undergraduate curricula were undertaken by computer professional societies and inte~ ested individuals [3,S,6,7,8,10,11,1$,1440,24. These models were meant to be general and to offer a reasonabledegree&freedom for the institutions choosing to adopt them. The mere existence of these models works to limit the common mistakea in CS curricula development snch as overplaying the role of programming courses, the bias towards topics relating to the expertiss of program designers, and the imbalance between the various components of a program. Many (n pro r worMwide are baaed on the suggestedmodels 1,22,4. However, it is our belief that these models were directed mainly to industrial, English-speaking countries and very little discussion is given to the moditkationa these models must undergo before adoption in developing and/or non-English speaking nations. This is especially regrettable since it is this group d departments that need more guidance in tailoring their programs to achkve the intended goals.

The wide utilization of technology, the abundance of information and knowledge, and the use of multimedia applications, create real challenges to present an efficient and attractive E-learning model that encompasses all these elements. Another dimension of these challenges is realizing the fact that a successful e-learning system must orchestrate different technological, pedagogical, cultural and social components. Examples of these components are an efficient infrastructure, smart classroom technologies, providing and efficient Learning Management System (LMS), designing and developing on-line digital content, training and society awareness. In addition, Any e-learning adoption must match learners' expectations in order to keep them motivated and attracted to the system. learners and instructors also must have efficient tools for knowledge presentations, searching for information, retaining information. This paper presents a new blended e-learning model and framework for an efficient implementation in K12 and higher education. The proposed model and framework successfully incorporates all the above elements.	categorization;david g. kirkpatrick;digital recording;internet;management system;online and offline;smart tv	Salah Al-Sharhan;Ahmed Al-Hunaiyyan;Hanaa Al-sharah	2010	2010 Fifth International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM)	10.1109/ICDIM.2010.5664642	knowledge representation and reasoning;the internet;further education;simulation;logic gate;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;database;multimedia;higher education;law;least squares;world wide web	EDA	-76.30347080067702	-36.58985672708523	91259

The curriculum is based on two widely used documents “Computing Curricula 1991” and “IS’97”. At the same time the curriculum is strongly influenced by the local conditions of Latvian higher education system and requirements of the labour market. Some international experience in a model curriculum development has been acquired, too. New trends have emerged and new requirements have been fixed. Now, after ten years of experience there is a strong necessity to weight the pros and cons and to start revising of the curriculum.	computer science;information system;race condition;requirement;teaching method	Janis Grundspenkis	2002			emergent curriculum;social science;knowledge management;curriculum mapping;higher education;management;information system;curriculum theory	Logic	-75.9305135098628	-32.09810170125367	91613

With the advances in technology, a need for access to all Web resources is becoming more and more recurrent due to the several advantages that the Web brings to those with some sort of disability, allowing them accessing and integrating in society. With this document we aim to present indicators regarding the lower accessibility levels of the Portuguese teaching institutions websites. A set of background and theoretical considerations is made alongside the article, as well as the results of an accessibility evaluation made to the Portuguese secondary schools websites using a specialized software tool and according to WCAG 2.0. The present document also contains a proposal for a model that aims on improving Web accessibility Levels in Portugal by fostering the creation of relations and group activities between the actors that, in our opinion, are those with the most relevance in the Web content accessibility issue.	conformance testing;extrapolation;internet;programming tool;recurrent neural network;relevance;shading;web content accessibility guidelines;web accessibility;web resource;world wide web	Ramiro Gonçalves;José Martins;Jorge Pereira;Vítor Santos;Manuel Pérez Cota	2013	J.

CSP in formal education is anticipatory of learning processes found in industry and research, in which the roles and responsibilities of 'teacher' and 'student' are fluid. Preparing students for this shift is one motivation for use of CSP. Further, CSP approaches are linked to constructivist and community theories of learning, and provide opportunities to engage students more deeply in subject material.  In this paper we advance the concept of CSP and relate it to the particular needs of computer science. We present a number of characteristics of this approach, and use case studies from the available literature to illustrate these characteristics in practice. We discuss enabling technologies, provide guidance to instructors who would like to incorporate this approach in their teaching, and suggest some future directions for the study and evaluation of this technique. We conclude with an extensive bibliography of related research and case studies which exhibit elements of CSP.	computer science;constructivist epistemology;theory	John Hamer;Quintin I.

Paper submissions are due November 1 and workshop/tutorial proposals are due December 15. For conference information, see http://ISLS.org/CSCL2009. The conference focuses on issues related to formal and informal learning through collaboration, promoting productive collaborative interactions with the help of the computer and other communication technologies. The conference theme “CSCL Practices” emphasizes practices relating to technology-based collaborative learning in schools, workplaces, and daily life. The CSCL community is not only concerned with studying and designing effective tools to support CSCL practices, but also with identifying specific educational and professional practices that are associated with their appropriate usages. In order to study practices in a reflective way, powerful theories and analytical approaches are required. The aim is to understand how learning emerges: on an individual level, on a groupcognition level, and at the community level. The CSCL conference and the CSCL journal work together to advance the collective understanding of the community of researchers and practitioners. The journal organizes a symposium at each conference and publishes expanded versions of important conference presentations. We look forward to seeing you on the historic island of Rhodes.	interaction;theory	Gerry Stahl;Friedrich W. Hesse	2008	I. J.

The construction of a new resume in this classroom calls on students to reexamine their previous work history in order to make connections between their past, their present, and their future. This reexamination also calls upon the student to critically reflect on the meaning and structure of their work history and, in the process, examine habits of mind and meaning perspectives which have previously defined them. When students successfully negotiate this process, they find a revised sense of identity, re-seeing themselves in their internal mirror. Their images of themselves take on new dimensions, and they feel more capable of completing their education and succeeding in their new career path.

Can knowledge management be of use in organisations as schools, where profit is of no interest? This article discusses the need for knowledge management from the perspectives of students, teachers and parents. In a case study master students in computer science developed knowledge-based systems for schools. These systems can be classified as support for (1) students' learning, (2) students and teachers regarding well being, (3) teachers' decision making. The conclusion is that intelligent systems, such as knowledge-based systems, could be used in schools, facilitating the knowledge management within the organisation.	knowledge management;knowledge-based systems	Anneli Edman	2005		10.1007/11552451_53	knowledge survey;organizational learning;knowledge integration;knowledge management;political science;knowledge engineering;management science;personal knowledge management;knowledge value chain;domain knowledge;pedagogy	AI	-76.05073825132898	-34.08738160886608	93405

Whereas gender is not an issue in the competency of employees in today's technical facilities, the so-called genderless workplace still does not exist. The genderless workplace is one in which employees are hired on the basis of qualifications and those features that make each person an individual but are not pluses or minuses on the job are ignored. Several areas, ranging from the day-to-day work environment to the responsibilities of employees who are parents, are considered with regard to achieving the goal of the genderless workplace. The efforts that can be made in a company to fully integrate the technical women on the staff into the team, from changes in the day-to-day decorum of the work environment to the equality of working parents, are discussed.<<ETX>>		Rebecca A.

The policy was implemented to ensure that all students, not just the engineers or the computer science majors, would be competent in using a computer to complete their academic work immediately and their professional work in the future. Drexel was one of the first universities to make such a strong commitment to the integration of computing throughout the entire academic course of study and established many support systems to improve the students' likelihood of success in utilizing technology. A group of programmers was established to develop academic course-ware to be used in classes. Faculty became the designers, the programmers , the developers. Drexel also established a user support center providing personal consulting, workshops and training, publications , and special programs to help students, faculty, and staff to maximize the use of their computers. Another program established to support this technological integration plan was the standardization on common software and hardware to be used campus-wide. Certainly with everyone using the same hardware platform, providing support was more efficient and effective , and a deep technical expertise could be developed among computer support staff. The university standardized on the Apple Macin-tosh because of its ease of use, portability, and strong interest in and commitment to higher education. Common software enabled the negotiation of favorable site license pricing based on volume and removed the notion of piracy on campus for supported products. The last, but not least, component of this overall plan to implement the new microcomputer access policy was the creation of a hardware purchase, distribution, and repair center on campus. Each year a Microcomputer Policy Committee, composed of one voting member from each college and advisory members from the Office of Computing Services, agreed to recommend between one and three different Macintosh models to incoming freshmen. Recommendations were made to ensure that students would acquire machines with adequate memory, hard disk capacity, and processing speed to complete their course work, and machines that would last them for the five years they expected to be at Drexel. Students received a letter in June giving them information about the recommended computer platforms and answering frequently asked questions about the recommended hardware. They then chose a machine and submitted their choice by mail, receiving a bill for the computer attached to their tuition bill.

4d6571c71f111d560db98b2aeba35a6429969a01	open-ended projects opened up — aspects of openness		One of the most important areas of competence for professional engineers is the ability to function well in project work, in particular they need to be able to efficiently solve open-ended problems in different collaborative settings. The development of this ability is however not prominent in engineering education despite numerous authors suggesting open-ended problems as a pedagogical tool to promote development of collaborative problem solving competence by including elements of group or project work in courses. In our own long experience of using open-ended problems in collaborative student projects, we have identified a lack of systematic progression in learning outcomes and skill development. We see this as a major obstacle for fully exploiting the potentials of using open-ended problems as an educational tool. We present a framework that provides a structured view of challenges related to openness that students can encounter in educational projects and that has an impact on the overall complexity of the project. We argue that there are different categories of openness to consider when designing educational settings based on open-ended projects. The categories addressed in this paper are: Character of the problems addressed. Character of the teams. Time constraints. Faculty involvement. External factors. Aspects of openness in the different categories are presented and related to professional engineering competencies. Furthermore, it is discussed how variations in project complexity can be accomplished by variations within the aspects and combinations of aspects. In particular, the framework addresses development and progression of professional competencies.

By and large, these expectations have not been realised. It has become evident that innovative technology alone does not necessarily guarantee progress nor perhaps even significant change in educational practice. This has led educational researchers to place greater emphasis on cultural issues that could account for the unexpectedly limited influence of technology-enhanced learning. This perception of the relationship between technology and learning is elaborated in the first section of the paper. It is complemented by a review of an alternative conception of computing, rooted in a methodology for modelling with dependency directed at the development of construals rather than programs, that is far better aligned to the demands of developing environments for learning. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential implications of this approach.

One of the biggest challenges was to professionalize the process of learning in order to prepare students for labour market needs. It should have involved a profound rethinking of the teaching process of professors. Given the importance of teaching methodologies in the new higher education framework, we have researched by analysing the official documents -the teaching guides- of all the technical degrees and master degrees of all Universities in Galicia -Spain- that contain any subject related to Technical Drawing in order to find out which teaching methods are used. The results indicate that the variety of methodological strategies used is low, and the traditional lecture teaching methodology is the most used. It shows that professors have not adapted their methodologies to the demands of EHEA; therefore, it is concluded that a profound renewal of the teaching strategies of Technical Drawing professors of the Galician Universities is necessary and urgent.	teaching method;technical drawing	Vicente López-Pena;Vicente A.

The CI with the support of technology progresses through platforms and computer systems including ontology, clusters, agents, Web intelligence among others. This research consists of a content analysis of recent studies 2012-2015 on CI. After an extensive search of publications on electronic databases, two hundred and fifteen papers were selected and exposed in a document's analysis following the approach of Zott. In this research we identified three categories to consider: Learning, technology and decision-making. The analysis revealed that CI is strongly related with technology, supporting the processes of training people and promoting collaborative learning as a new form of literacy.	collective intelligence;computer cluster;database;intelligent agent;ontology (information science);web intelligence	Francisca Grimón;Jaime Meza;Mónica Vaca-Cardenas;Josep Maria Monguet	2017	ICST Trans. e-Education e-Learning	10.4108/eai.26-7-2017.152905	social science;sociological intelligence;political science;management science	Web+IR	-68.96306776187292	-28.01252486005434	94408

5d84ef67872c721af16c14bdae773ce49e16faaa	towards integrating conversational agents and learning analytics in moocs		Higher Education Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) introduce a way of transcending formal higher education by realizing technology-enhanced formats of learning and instruction and by granting access to an audience way beyond students enrolled in any one Higher Education Institution. However, although MOOCs have been reported as an efficient and important educational tool, there is a number of issues and problems related to their educational impact. More specifically, there is an important number of drop outs during a course, little participation, and lack of students’ motivation and engagement overall. This may be due to one-size-fits-all instructional approaches and very limited commitment to student-student and teacher-student collaboration. This paper introduces the development agenda of a newly started European project called “colMOOC” that aims to enhance the MOOCs experience by integrating collaborative settings based on Conversational Agents and screening methods based on Learning Analytics, to support both students and teachers during a MOOC course. Conversational pedagogical agents guide and support student dialogue using natural language both in individual and collaborative settings. Integrating this type of conversational agents into MOOCs to trigger peer interaction in discussion groups can considerably increase the engagement and the commitment of online students and, consequently, reduce MOOCs dropout rate. Moreover, Learning Analytics techniques can support teachers’ orchestration and students’ learning during MOOCs by evaluating students’ interaction and participation. The research reported in this paper is currently undertaken within the research project colMOOC funded by the European Commission.	dialog system;massive open online course	Stavros N.

Using a novel approach to identifying edits to the same part of a Wikipedia article, we show that a majority of edits to two example articles are not associated with discussion on the article Talk page, suggesting the possibility of stigmergic coordination. However, discussion does seem to be related to article quality, suggesting the limits to this approach to coordination.	stigmergy;wikipedia	Amira Rezgui;Kevin Crowston	2018		10.1145/3233391.3233543	knowledge management;stigmergy;computer science	NLP	-65.4444665040661	-33.35747436161115	94743

But, this transformation must occur taking our society, culture and economy into consideration. Blended learning approach can be the pathway of success towards that direction. Sloan has aptly stated, “Blended learning is the sleeping giant that will transform higher education pedagogically, culturally and institutionally.” Blended learning means the comprehensive instructional approach for providing socialized, constructivist and sustainable learning experiences through the meaningful integration of face-to-face interactions and e-learning techniques. This approach will be able to make learning process more efficient, easy, socialized, well-organized and Professional. Through this approach, we can bring the dream of time relevant, quality assured and student centered higher education for the new Millennium in reality. This will be the first step of education towards making India a superpower.	experience;gene regulatory network;interaction;socialization	Sandeep Patil;Ganesh Shinde	2010	2010 International Conference on Technology for Education	10.1109/T4E.2010.5550043	simulation;blended learning;engineering;multimedia;pedagogy	SE	-73.52757116825049	-35.127927969616046	94868

Our findings demonstrate that it was not enough that the team maintained a persistent record of their communication. It was also critical that this record was archived and accessible in an appropriate media for rapid and effortless re-use, and that it be dynamically re-configurable to adapt to the team members’ changing communication and informational requirements over the project lifecycle.

The rationale behind these decisions is that the overqualified staff member in a low level position will continue to look for a better position more aligned with their skills, experience, and education; and when they find another job they will leave and their positions will have to be filled again. This essay argues that this reasoning is flawed and, regardless of the perceived inconvenience, library managers and administrators should want the best and the brightest working in all levels of their library.	public library	Eddie Woodward	2016	Public Library Quarterly	10.1080/01616846.2016.1198638	professional development;knowledge management;management;pedagogy	Theory	-75.85964700783538	-29.84557275765765	95265

This paper analyses three designs for tagclouds that are integrated in the ReScope framework for reflection support. ReScope provides a widget for visualising personal tag-clouds of the tags that were used with social bookmarking services. The presented designs focus on processing and representing attention meta-data on the levels of recency, of collaboration, and of social connectedness from the perspective of situated learning.

Evolution, especially the later human-artificial stage, shows essential functions tending to continue but intense competition to determine which structures (self-regulatory adaptive systems) will carry on those functions. The library community is a system that appears insufficiently equipped to compete adaptively over the long term. To be competitively invulnerable would require, in addition to carrying on its present essential functions, assumption of two new ones: (1) support of basic information science, including research leadership in the field, and (2) constant self-renewal through some drastic form of continuing education, e.g., joint commitment by school and student to lifelong cyclic return to the school, following the first degree. (An example of such a competitively invulnerable community is the medical community.) Assumption of both new functions would be necessary and sufficient. More are not needed, but anything short of both would probably lead to absorption of functions and personnel of the library community by other, more competitively adaptive informational communities.

This paper explores the extent that librarianship influenced museum information practices in a predigital era. Instead of divergence, I find examples where museums adapted library methods to fit their needs instead of developing their own set of professional practices. Because museum professionalization placed an emphasis on discipline-based university training, information work in museums has been incorporated into nonuniversity technical education and on-the-job training programs. That this divergence of information work from academic preparation has fallen along gender lines requires additional attention.	active appearance model;alistair sinclair;archive;coherence (physics);dewey decimal classification;information needs;information retrieval;information system;knowledge organization;librarian;library (computing);library science;museum informatics;partial template specialization;requirement;subtext;system requirements;vergence	Richard J.

Traditional mathematical analysis begins with undefined elements and axioms. It then derives theorems from them, in the hope the results will correspond to something useful, so that the system is a model for physical behavior ofinterest. In contrast, legal analysis seizes on a paradigm, explores its implications, and applies them as a tool for resolving conflicting legal interests that the paradigm is supposed to represent. Thus the law has tried to resolve conflicts between factory owners and surrounding property owners objecting to toxic wastes emanating from the factories by vacillating between two conflicting paradigms. The most recent paradigm battle in Micro Law's territory is over defamation on the Internet.

Not only that, but in a participatory paradigm, it seems useful for the user to learn certain journalistic skills. This is called news literacy. Some scholars have been researching the use of digital media to teach news literacy to teenagers and college students, in particular interactive storytelling and gaming. However, less is known about platforms for younger children. And yet a few of those platforms exist. This paper summarizes an ongoing doctoral research and presents preliminary results about the analysis of eight platforms aimed at teaching news literacy to children. We examined the lessons delivered and how interactive storytelling elements were incorporated. We make recommendations for the design of future interactive platforms to teach news literacy. Ultimately our work extends knowledge of how news literacy is being approached in interactive digital platforms and of how interactive storytelling can better be used to foster news literacy.	interactive storytelling	Ioli Campos	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-71027-3_40	literacy;multimedia;digital media;computer science;disinformation;misinformation;storytelling;fake news;citizen journalism;interactive storytelling	ML	-68.97366860746045	-33.635216946491454	96943

Tangible, technologically enriched objects enable children, aged six/seven, to learn by serious gaming. By addressing creative, collaborative and spatial skills a playful approach to language learning is developed that connects to an existing educational format used in Dutch primary schools.

We illustrate this with examples from the Virtual Observatory framework, and the NCI EDRN project. An effective sharing and reuse of tools, methods, and experiences from different fields can save a lot of effort, time, and expense. HCI can thus benefit from the proven solutions to big data challenges from other domains.	big data;edrn;human–computer interaction;informatics;nc (complexity);virtual observatory	S.

77b4b3c8ed129c97bac07fc02f00aff340016341	exploring the technical history of games through software and visualization		The history of computer game implementation, driven by source code and development practice, remains largely hidden from view, with only the most dedicated and technically savvy game historians and scholars able to take part in its study. My research hopes to reveal and encourage access to technical history through the analysis of the scholarly practices used in exploring legacy game systems. I will turn to two primary case studies, MUD1 and DOOM, both of which have creator supported archival collections. In proceeding with a historical study of spatial representation in both games, I hope to embed a meta-analysis into my study that involves both defining specifications and toy systems to support scholarly research, and developing visualizations for scholarly presentation. The result is to, a) make a compelling argument about the technical systems behind historical games, b) create systems for better scholarly research of and communication about technical implementation, and c) promote the preservation and storage of historical game development documentation.	archive;documentation;doom;emoticon;history of computing hardware;pc game;video game development	Eric Kaltman	2015			multimedia;simulation;computer science;human–computer interaction;visualization;software	HCI	-63.014249617323586	-33.28950995416904	97423

The integrative device is the bibliogram, a linguistic object consisting of a seed term and the terms that co-occur with it, ranked by their co-occurrence counts with the seed – a standard “core and scatter” distribution. While the counts and the measures derived from them are indeed central to bibliometrics, the associated terms are also important, and they exhibit distinctive features that lead to psycholinguistic insights into their distributions. This verbal side of bibliometrics is seldom highlighted when the field is introduced, yet it may be of particular interest to persons with backgrounds in the humanities. A list of words that students associate with the word “information” is presented as a reference point from psycholinguistics. Then term associations in bibliograms are illustrated with the journals that cite an author, the books assigned to a Library of Congress class, the journals that yield varying numbers of articles to three literatures defined by seed terms, the bylines that an author cites in a reading list, and the authors that are co-cited with Plato in a map of the Plato literature.	attachments;bibliogram;bibliometrics;book;complement (complexity);google scholar;information school;information scientist;librarian;mathematical model;scopus;sorting;text corpus;web of science;web page;web search engine;world wide web;worldcat;dialog;eric	Howard D.

According to the International Usability Standard, usability is related to: “The effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with which specified users achieve specified goals in particular environments”. In other words: information is useful if it is delivered to the right person in the right location at the right time in the right amount and the right form (and so on). The same principle can add value also in other areas of our social life meaning in our existence as members of a society, in legislation for example.	information science;usability	Katrin Nyman-Metcalf;Ermo Täks	2013	I.

The course achieved its objectives but also sparked the development of current UK e-learning because the course developed people who were skilled at adaptability and flexibility with ever changing technology coupled with a thorough understanding of how people learn, and these were highly motivated to use their skills. The effectiveness of the course can be seen by the number of people from Project Author who are still in the sector and in highly influential positions. Introduction Project Author was an intensive UK Government funded Training Opportunities Scheme (TOPS) course run during the 1980s by the Manpower Services Commission (MSC) which was part of the Department for Employment. The course was to boost the number of people with appropriate skills capable of meeting the growing demand for Technology Based Training (TBT) within industry and commerce. This paper attempts to show why this was a course created with vision, with an immediate impact on industry and long term effects on the use of technology in training in the UK and elsewhere. It serves as a model that could be adapted to address the current shortage of instructional designers in the UK. Background During the 1960s and 70s computer technology and its application towards learning had been developing steadily. By the late 1970s mainframe computers were being used both for applications within business and also for training people to use those applications. The screens tended to be small and use green and black as the only colour scheme, British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 39 No 2 2008 401–408 doi:10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00836.x © 2008 The Author. Journal compilation © 2008 British Educational Communications and Technology Agency. Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 9600 Garsington Road, Oxford OX4 2DQ, UK and the contents were mostly text based. Nevertheless learners could be set questions and tasks to do which they could complete at their own pace, and have some flexibility when deciding to carry out their learning. The early 1980s brought the Personal Computer, the BBC ‘B’, the Apple II and a multitude of other computers which had colour, graphic capabilities and interactions with the learners. Although these features would not be considered significant when compared to current capabilities, they opened opportunities and prompted creativity within the training field. Mike Bower, the key player in the development of Project Author at Datasolve Education explained the situation at the time (1982): Computer Based Training has been around for some 20 years but it is only comparatively recently that advances in technology have given us the essential tools to make the techniques available to a much wider audience ... . At one time the major break on full scale use of CBT was equipment cost. Now that equipment costs are dropping, we have another problem, a shortage of experienced CBT authors. In this context, Mike Bower approached the Manpower Services Commission (MSC) with a course design that addressed these missing skills identified by industry and that was demand led with a curriculum built from a work perspective. Others involved in the course included Mike Dowsey of IBM, Quentin Whitlock of Dean Associates and Dr Mike Vinegrad of Goldsmiths College. There were two pilot courses. The first of these pilots ran for 6 months but for the second, the timescale was compressed to 18 weeks. It was important to note that the course was developed by practitioners from the industry that needed it and that the people delivering the course were from a variety of backgrounds. The credibility and status of the course creators and the way in which it was delivered were fundamental to the success of the course. The candidates selected for Project Author tended to be ex-teachers or trainers. However the course was ‘open entry’ with rigorous interviews to identify people who were likely to make the best of the course and use it productively afterwards. The Training Opportunities Scheme (TOPS) which funded the course was a government initiative to mitigate the high unemployment of the time and candidates had to be in receipt of unemployment benefit. Some candidates became deliberately unemployed in order to take the course! Project Author exceeded expectations in many respects. For the first (and subsequent courses) advertisements were placed in The Times and The Guardian. Over 800 requested an application form for the first course, 364 sent in their forms and 61 candidates were interviewed. Twelve carefully balanced candidates were selected: six trainers and six teachers, six men and six women. The majority were graduates. Funding, time commitment and outcome for trainees For the candidates acceptance on the course meant a slight rise in income from unemployment benefit as TOPS courses came with an allowance and travel subsidy. However 402 British Journal of Education Technology Vol 39 No 2 2008 © 2008 The Author. Journal compilation © 2008 British Educational Communications and Technology Agency. the course was very demanding and proceeded at fast pace from the first week so it was clearly not an ‘easy option’ to take. The course was planned round an eight hour day for 13 weeks. During the first few years the course ran (1983–88) there was the benefit of a 5-week placement in industry, working on a real project that directly utilised the skills learned on the course. Unfortunately this placement was later removed and the course was poorer as a result. The intensive commitment demanded by the course contrasted sharply with the reputation of courses based in many educational establishments. The focus, relevance, pace and urgency of the course contrasted to the slower, more abstract and constructivist approach of academics. The clear connections to industry and commerce made by examples, visiting speakers and placements boosted motivation. They built confidence because it was clear there were good opportunities for employment afterwards. The appointments sections of newspapers were studied weekly. The posts advertised required the very skills that the trainees were rapidly acquiring, again reinforcing the relevance of the course to a better future. And most of the graduates did achieve employment with good prospects after the course. As with most business based courses, the trainees were judged on the quality of their outputs, rather than on time spent in classroom or on the results of an examination. There was talk of an accredited certificate being awarded but this was never achieved— although several recognised qualifications have since been created. The sponsoring organisations who gave placements to the trainees could also gain from Project Author. Some of these had already tried computer based training (CBT) and could see its potential, and some had provided input to the course content. Others were organisations that were just beginning to use CBT and interactive video. By providing a placement—or two—they could start a project and test the outcomes in their organisation, and then keep the training produced. Sponsors were from many types of organisation and from many different sectors. The number of sponsors requiring trainees outnumbered the trainees on each course because it was very popular with sponsors!

The first brought everyone to a common starting level, given the variation of training and educational backgrounds within each cohort, with experiences of different training methods such as classroom, and distance learning. The introduction also included looking at many examples of TBT. The second unit was a refresher on learning theory and its application in educational technology. The course had an approach loosely based on the ADDIE model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation) and the next unit covered analysis. This included task analysis, target population analysis, and writing objectives, particularly concentrating on SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time based) objectives and avoidance of fuzzy ones. Working with subject matter experts (SMEs) was also included as an essential to successful analysis. Course design followed the analysis with skills such as specifying course pre-entry requirements, course structure and delivery, flowcharting, storyboarding, media selection, screen design, and question techniques, culminating in the production of a Design Specification. The trainees were required to produce a short piece of CBT to be demonstrated at an ‘Open Day’ about 6 weeks into the course where sponsors were invited to come and see the work and select trainees for their secondment. At this point the design specification took on particular relevance and clarified minds on the topic for the demonstration. The course was produced on BBC ‘B’ computers using Microtext.* Sponsors could work through the ‘course’ with the trainee and see the standard of preparatory work. A great deal of effort went into making sure the demonstration was well structured and did not fall over!

It is necessary to cultivate children's interest in books to achieve this goal. In this paper, we propose a user-generated agent (UGA) that introduces books. Elementary school children can program the behavior of the UGA themselves. The UGA not only cultivates the children's interest in the book introduced by the agent, but also their motivation for the presentation by allowing them to design the contents of the agent. We promote the habit of reading by allowing the children to modify the agent's design and giving them the opportunity to refine their ability to promote books.	book;graphics display resolution;library (computing);robot;user-generated content	Yusuke Kudo;Wataru Kayano;Takuya Sato;Hirotaka Osawa	2016		10.1145/2974804.2980489	engineering;artificial intelligence;multimedia;communication	ECom	-68.25731544624685	-36.35728557599165	98274

CSCL is a problem-driven field with a history of incorporating different paradigms, and has the advantage of using a design stance to understand phenomena like collaboration and learning that are difficult to study. Roles are understood differently by different disciplines, but the concept of roles serves as a boundary object between the different disciplines within CSCL and highlights potential areas for research. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A number of experiments have been carried out to assess the impact of group cohesiveness on productivity in various settings since the 1930's. No such study, however, has been carried out in the DP industry. Group cohesiveness is defined as the group property that emerges from the set of cohesions (bonds) that exist in a group. It is the bond between participants, between participants and the leader, and between participant and his conception of the group as a whole.	experiment;group cohesiveness;human factors and ergonomics	Raghava G.

The purpose of this paper is to assess what aspects of CCPM are appropriate in operations courses, whether dedicated project management classes or broader introductory operations management. To answer this, we survey academic literature on traditional project management problems that gave rise to CCPM to understand if these issues are real. We also examine if the CCPM methodology should, according to scholars, correct these problems, and survey project success stories attributed to CCPM. We conclude that CCPM is an appropriate project management methodology for student consideration on the basis of motivating critical thinking—especially about behavioral issues— rather than formal scientific proof of its merit. In so doing, we survey teaching resources as well as articles in the trade press on the subject. We then present a sequence of numerical practice problems that are designed to motivate further critical reflection about CCPM. Throughout are a number of open questions about CCPM that the academic community has not yet answered that instructors should keep in mind.	numerical analysis;scheduling (computing)	William P.

835f495b8dc39055c3fa05c0adc033f5b89b7802	the explanatory visualization framework: an active learning framework for teaching creative computing using explanatory visualizations		Visualizations are nowadays appearing in popular media and are used everyday in the workplace. This democratisation of visualization challenges educators to develop effective learning strategies, in order to train the next generation of creative visualization specialists. There is high demand for skilled individuals who can analyse a problem, consider alternative designs, develop new visualizations, and be creative and innovative. Our three-stage framework, leads the learner through a series of tasks, each designed to develop different skills necessary for coming up with creative, innovative, effective, and purposeful visualizations. For that, we get the learners to create an explanatory visualization of an algorithm of their choice. By making an algorithm choice, and by following an active-learning and project-based strategy, the learners take ownership of a particular visualization challenge. They become enthusiastic to develop good results and learn different creative skills on their learning journey.	imagery;next-generation network;algorithm;explanation	Jonathan C. Roberts;Panagiotis D.

Rather, the Web allows for a myriad of search strategies. Although there are numerous studies of Web search techniques, these studies often limit their focus to just one part of the search process and are not based on the behavior of the general user population, nor do they include information about the users. To remedy these shortcomings, this project looks at how people find information online in the context of their other media use, their general Internet use patterns, in addition to using information about their demographic background and social support networks. This article describes the methodology in detail, and suggests that a mix of survey instruments and in-person observations can yield the type of rich data set that is necessary to understand in depth the differences in people’s information retrieval behavior online.	freedom of information laws by country;information retrieval;internet;search algorithm;social support;web content;web search engine;world wide web	Eszter Hargittai	2002	JASIST	10.1002/asi.10166	cognitive models of information retrieval;computer science;methodology;data mining;multimedia;law;world wide web;human–computer information retrieval	Web+IR	-74.14696613243284	-25.255545513529388	98912

With a population of 180 million people, information is the key to better distribute resources and provide better healthcare. Taking advantage of the concepts and infrastructure of the Brazilian National Health Card, in 2003 a huge project was started aiming to build an integrated web based application for the City of São Paulo to collect patient encounter information, to regulate complex procedures authorizations and to build an integrated patient scheduling system that would allow to schedule consultations and medical procedures in any health provider. This would reduce the waiting time, organize the flow of patients, and greatly improves the quality of care. The challenge was to build a quality application in a short time frame for one of the biggest cities in the world with impressive numbers: 22 million inhabitants, 386 primary care units, 158 Polyclinics, 105 hospitals, 40.000 first consultations per day, 75.000 healthcare professionals and 7.000 computers that would access the information system. The information system had to be operated mostly by users with no computer training at all and, as such, should provide an user interface that was intuitive and easy to learn. This presentation will share the experience of building such a system, showing how it was designed, the challenges, the problems, what changed in the health system once it was deployed and how it was possible to build the system on the proposed time frame. From the time the first use case was specified to the time the information system was deployed, only four months had elapsed and 2.5 million lines of code were produced. After 3 years of production, the information system improved the public system efficiency by about 35%. INVITED SPEAKER'S CV Fabiane Bizinella Nardon has an MSc and a PhD in Computer Sciences.

Although these life events differ across the human lifespan, considering them as a group of 'sensitive life experiences', and exploring the similarities and differences in how we approach those experiences as researchers could be invaluable in generating a better understanding of them. In this workshop, we aim to identify current opportunities for, and barriers to, the design of social computing systems that support people during sensitive life events and transitions. Participants will take part in activities centred around exploring the similarities and differences between their own and others' research methods and results, drawing on their own experiences in discussions around carrying out research in these sensitive contexts.	experience;human–computer interaction;social computing	Daniel Herron;Nazanin Andalibi;Oliver L.

The complexities of the many concepts and models around information literacy are considered, and some personal views given as to how they may best be clarified, both theoretically and practically. A slightly adapted idea of the concept of information fluency can serve as a main general purpose for the promotion of information literacy, expressed as a more specific meta-model for the prevailing technological environment, and as still more specific components for a particular context. The focus of this relatively stable general formulation is on understanding, rather than skills or competences. It can incorporate the need for education, advice and counseling, as well as information provision, and with domain-specific literacies, as well as supporting personal information literacy.	domain-specific language;information literacy;library and information science;metamodeling;personally identifiable information	David Bawden	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-14136-7_2	computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;pedagogy	NLP	-73.49865119167048	-31.41586588810946	99847

Specifically, we suggest reading independence and elderliness as shaped by both the discursive and the material. Our starting point is the notion of intra-action as introduced in Feminist Technoscience. Thinking through use and design of digital technology from a standpoint of Feminism prompts us to widen the perspective on living with such technologies and, thusly, to raise questions about the process of coming of age as an independent person with such care technologies.

This is especially true when the design includes innovative technologies. It is difficult to design a networked learning environment that closely fits the requirements of the educational practice. Often the technology seems leading in the design process because it is the most tangible aspect of the e-learning environment. This brings along the risk that the technology becomes detached from its context of use. Design patterns are a means to overcome this problem of detachment between design and practice. Design patterns make the tight relationship between the two more explicit. In this paper we further elaborate on the relationship between design and practice. We will stress the importance of theory in the development of design patterns. Theory development is an essential aspect of our approach to the development of design patterns. The approach is oriented towards a systematic analysis of problems and the development of conceptual models that guide the definition and evaluation of design patterns. In this paper we present a case study of how the approach was used to develop design patterns for networked learning in the classroom.

At present we need empower people to solve problems we do not even know yet. This requires a substantial change of education, away from teaching knowledge towards teaching meta-skills such as problem solving, non-linear thinking, creativity, or communication skills -- the so-called 21st century skills. This is not trivial, since such meta-abilities cannot simply be tackled by conventional tutorial methods. IN this paper we briefly introduce an approach to systematize 21st century skills and to develop intelligent tutorial systems for this distinct domain.	domain model;nonlinear system;problem solving;virtual world	Michael D.

We have found it useful to organize the teaching materials for these workshops by standardizing the overhead transparencies that are used by our instructors. We have found that as a direct benefit of this team approach, we can maintain consistent organization in teaching our workshops; our instructors are certain to cover the important aspects of each topic; they are better able to assess the time that will be required to cover each topic and they are less likely to be side-tracked from their subject matter. It has become much easier to prepare and rotate the teaching assignments among our instructors by this method, and the instructors find that they can prepare for a workshop on shorter notice (should an emergency arise) if they've taught this workshop in the past.  Three years ago, while each instructor prepared his or her own temporary overhead transparencies on clear acetate sheets with water soluble pens, we began the process of learning to pool our ideas, determine what concepts were consistent and relevant—and prepare permanent, standardized sets of overhead transparencies for many of our workshops. We have developed a filing system for maintaining our overhead transparency sets, and make periodic modifications to these sets. Our transparency supplies consist of such simple materials as transparency film, water-based and permanent transparency pens, chartpak and zip-a-tone—all the way to the more sophisticated Kroy lettering machine, the electrostatic Versatec plotter and the newest addition—SAS/GRAPH.  As the computer literacy rate has risen among our user community, the need for more technical and specialized instruction has also risen. By standardizing our workshop teaching materials, we have been able to free up more of the instructors' time and allow them to apply their research efforts toward new areas of computer literacy, while keeping pace with the needs and special interests of our user community.  The paper that I propose will discuss the basic considerations that are necessary to produce clear, visible, and attractive overhead transparencies. Basic topics will include: simple DOs and DON'Ts of transparency making, examples of good and poor transparency style; suggestions for redesigning overhead transparencies for better comprehension and visibility, and current visual media preparation at The Ohio State University.	database;general-purpose modeling;overhead (computing);plotter;sas;subject matter expert turing test;transparency (projection);virtual community	Gail S.

While this method appears, at times, unconventional by academic standards, there are significant pedagogical advantages. As technology develops, online education will become not only easier to deliver but essential for learners in the 21st century. The concepts presented in this paper represent the knowledge and experience collected horn one and a half years of pioneering in online education.

Though often described as """"raw,"""" this data is produced by techniques of measurement that are imbued with judgments and values that dictate what is counted and what is not, what is considered the best unit of measurement, and how different things are grouped together and """"made"""" into a measureable entity. In this paper, we analyze these politics of measurement and how they relate to action through two case studies involving high stake public health measurements where experts intentionally leverage measurement to change definitions of harm and health. That is, they use measurement for activism. The case studies offer a framework for thinking about of how the politics of measurement are present in user interfaces. It is usually assumed that the human element has been scrubbed from the database and that significant political and subjective interventions come from the analysis or use of data after the fact. Instead, we argue that human-computer interactions start before the data reaches the computer because various measurement interfaces are the invisible premise of data and databases, and these measurements are political."""	algorithm;big data;comefrom;database;human–computer interaction;population;user interface	Kathleen H.

It is also one of the most frustrating. In fact, the situation has become a notorious symbol of the Web's growing size and lack of structure, as well as the inadequacy of Web search technologies. However, a number of Web companies and research organizations are taking a variety of approaches to try to solve this problem. Traditional search technology (see the sidebar """" Traditional Web Search Technology """") is based on users typing in keywords for the information they want to receive. Search services then scan Web pages for those keywords. This approach consistently causes a number of well-known problems. Users must try to come up with the correct keywords for their search. If the keywords are too general or have multiple meanings, users may receive too many results or too many irrelevant results to find the information they want. For example, a search for """" history of rock """" could yield results related to popular music, geology, or history classes at a university. Meanwhile, the wrong choice of keywords may lead to useless results or no results at all. """" In general, what's happening is the Boolean search techniques from the 60s and 70s are running out of gas, """" said Kevin Werbach, managing editor of Release 1.0, a newsletter on emerging communications and computing technologies. There are considerable commercial incentives for developing better search technologies. Various search services— including AltaVista, Excite, Lycos, and Yahoo—are turning their Web pages into portals. Portals are Web home bases from which users can access a variety of services, including searches, e-commerce, stock prices, weather forecasts , chat rooms, and driving directions. Companies want to attract more people to their portals because the more unique users they attract, the more money they can charge advertisers and partners on the sites. Figure 1 lists the five Web sites that attracted the most unique visitors as of May 1999. Search services are a key to attracting users because they are an important reason people use portals in the first place. Moreover, about 71 percent of Internet users utilize search services to find Web sites, according to Nielsen Media Research , a company that measures computer and Internet usage (as well as television audience levels).

One is how to describe embodied experience, and the other is how to encourage people to learn from someone else’s descriptions of experiences. In the domain of town-walking, we have devised a methodology for doing these, in which embodied experience is described as a combination of the physical things and setting that one’s body faces and the interpretations one generates for those. That is a kind of pattern language. We argue that a pattern language is a mere provision of distilled words to tell about experiences, and may not make sense to others. Our methodology provides not only pattern language but also the original stories of experiences from which pattern language has been distilled. Stories told are expected to set the grounds to understand words in the pattern language, and motivate others to use them to see and story-tell about towns. In the workshop on learning in town-walking, we found that metacognitive awareness to physical features and relations in towns is the key to learning.	embodied cognition;experience;pattern language;towns	Masaki Suwa;Fumitoshi Kato	2013			computer science;artificial intelligence;pattern language;multimedia	HCI	-65.11211066762978	-35.232480599357864	100771

The HTRC is the research arm of the HathiTrust, an online repository dedicated to the provision of access to a comprehensive body of published works for scholarship and education. The HathiTrust is a partnership of over 100 major research institutions and libraries working to ensure that the cultural record is preserved and accessible long into the future. Membership is open to institutions worldwide. Over 13.1 million volumes (4.7 billion pages) have been ingested into the HathiTrust digital archive from sources including Google Books, member university libraries, the Internet Archive, and numerous private collections. The HTRC is dedicated to facilitating scholarship by enabling analytic access to the corpus, developing research tools, fostering research projects and communities, and providing additional resources such as enhanced metadata and indices that will assist scholars to more easily exploit the HathiTrust materials.  This talk will outline the mission, goals and structure of the HTRC. It will also provide an overview of recent work being conducted on a range of projects, partnerships and initiatives. Projects include Workset Creation for Scholarly Analysis project (WCSA, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation) and the HathiTrust + Bookworm project (HT+BW, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities). HTRC's involvement with the NOVEL(TM) text mining project and the Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis (SIMSSA) project, both funded by the SSHRC Partnership Grant programme, will be introduced. The HTRC's new feature extraction and Data Capsule initiatives, part of its ongoing work its ongoing efforts to enable the non-consumptive analyses of the approximately 8 million volumes under copyright restrictions will also be discussed. The talk will conclude with some suggestions on how the non-consumptive research model might be improved upon and possibly extended beyond the HathiTrust context.	archive;digital library;feature extraction;hathitrust;library (computing);text mining	J.

In 2017, the ITiCSE IoT working group identified relevant content, tools for teaching, and four IoT course types. The resulting report provided an entry point for educators challenged with setting up a new IoT course, but did not consider the curricular content of a standalone specialization nor effective teaching approaches for this interdisciplinary field. In this report, the 2018 working group builds on its prior work through an updated review of literature and interviews with IoT instructors. The report addresses two research questions. First, what should a curriculum intended to produce IoT specialists include? We propose here a transdisciplinary curriculum that integrates threads from several disciplines on a single campus and we relate it to the ACM/IEEE 2013 Computing Curricula Knowledge Areas. Second, what pedagogical practices should be used to teach IoT?

Recent curricular guidelines (1994/1997) do not give special priority to IT and treat IT within normal administrative routines. Still priority is given to and understanding advocated of the potential and importance of IT in education. This paper comments on this situation in the educational field.

83fb1ecdce16206da80cf96bdd97b1e3eb185d3b	whole person integrated care (wpic): a healthcare transformation strategy supported by a novel spreadsheet-based software framework		This paper describes a humanitarian healthcare transformation strategy called Whole Person Integrated Care (WPIC). WPIC couples a Spreadsheet-based Software Framework (SSF) and a care delivery model that focus on increasing efficiency and effectiveness through evidence-based knowledge and action. This strategy: 1) integrates “sick care” (treatment of health problems) with “well care” (prevention and self-management) and 2) addresses both physical and psychological problems affecting a patient's health. The SSF currently utilizes Microsoft Excel to create simple, low-cost, and flexible software solutions that capture, import, export, transform, integrate, organize, store, analyze, render, and exchange data and information. Using a node-to-node (point-to-point) network architecture, clinicians, researchers, patients, and others can connect securely and resiliently, anywhere and anytime, across national and organizational boundaries. This allows collaborators to build, share, evaluate, and evolve evidence-based knowledge and analytic models. The shared knowledge and models are used to make projections, reveal existing problems, identify risks, and offer solutions that support decisions for clinical and business process improvement. The paper also describes an SSF application recently piloted in a Federal health information technology program, and proposes an open source community.	anytime algorithm;business process;network architecture;open-source software;point-to-point protocol;self-management (computer science);shortest seek first;software framework;spreadsheet	Stephen E.

c0d0163c0876fbc303bc5e74c7878d11b7712583	rhizomatic principles in mlearning: a synthesis of existing qualitative research		Educational technological innovation to enhance the learning experience of students requires a sound understanding of intended learning outcomes. Similarly, an understanding of the pedagogical affordances of technology is required in order to make appropriate choices regarding which technologies are most suitable to achieve intended outcomes. While mLearning is perceived as the future of learning (Arrigo et al. 2013), an understanding of its application in facilitating the achievement of specific learning objectives is limited. This may lead to negative quality perceptions and subsequently have a negative impact on the adoption of potentially rich technological resources. The challenge for educators is to create learning environments based on sound didactical principles (Brown 2003). The purpose of this study is to highlight rhizomatic principles in mLearning practice. This may contribute to creating an awareness of rhizomatic principles in mLearning practice and this in turn may improve their practice.	rhizome (philosophy)	Lydia Mbati	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-25684-9_4	knowledge management;affordance;political science;qualitative research	Logic	-74.01722157963843	-37.28367557158929	101495

Even if the academic course work of higher education can be replicated online, what cannot are the organized extracurricular activities which have been a crucial component of a traditional college education. These activities create social capital, prepare students for civic engagement and combat the self-absorbed individualism which undermines democratic society. We would do well to think about their loss, and the unintended social consequences which flow from adopting the Virtual University as a model for higher education in the twenty-first century.	unintended consequences	David Resnick	2000	First Monday		distance education;public relations;educational technology;social science;social capital;sociology;higher education;civic virtue;law	Crypto	-72.70466025900541	-31.02923142607099	101847

Most pupils use computers, smartphones and the Internet on a daily basis and develop their own understandings of them, but these conceptions are hardly integrated in their education. According to the idea of educational reconstruction, the pupils' processes of learning will be supported and made easier and their cognitive representations of the subject matter will get more interconnected and applicable, if their understandings are included in the educational processes. Therefore, we adopted an early study from biology education and investigated how 386 German pupils of different school types arranged, categorized and distinguished 23 terms related to the digital world (eg. """"computer"""", """"mobile phone"""", """"Facebook""""). We also asked, if any of the terms does not belong to the other terms in the opinion of each respondent, and found that robots and 3D were the most frequent terms not to belong to any of the others."""	categorization;computer science;digital artifact;internet;mobile phone;robot;smartphone;subject matter expert turing test	Ira Diethelm;Torsten Brinda;Nina Schneider	2017		10.1145/3137065.3137079	the internet;digital artifact;pedagogy;mobile phone;respondent;multimedia;perception;computer science;cognition	HCI	-72.85343121492382	-37.388337865031644	101885

Research demonstrates that learning management systems (LMSs) can increase student sense of community, support learning communities and enhance student engagement and success, and LMSs have therefore become core enterprise component in many universities. We were invited to undertake a current state analysis of enterprise LMS use in a large research-intensive university, to provide data to inform and guide an LMS review and strategic planning process. Using a new e-learning analytics platform, combined with data visualization and participant observation, we prepared a detailed snapshot of current LMS use patterns and trends and their relationship to student learning outcomes. This paper presents selected data from this “current state analysis” and comments on what it reveals about the comparative effectiveness of this institution’s LMS integration in the service of learning and teaching. More critically, it discusses the reality that the institutional planning process was nonetheless dominated by technical concerns, and made little use of the intelligence revealed by the analytics process. To explain this phenomenon we consider theories of change management and resistance to innovation, and argue that to have meaningful impact, learning analytics proponents must also delve into the socio-technical sphere to ensure that learning analytics data are presented to those involved in strategic institutional planning in ways that have the power to motivate organizational adoption and cultural change.	data visualization;snapshot (computer storage);sociotechnical system;theory	Leah Macfadyen;Shane Dawson	2012	Educational Technology & Society		analytics;e;organizational culture;social science;simulation;strategic planning;program evaluation;resource allocation;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;participant observation;management science;plan;data analysis;management;world wide web;pedagogy;data	AI	-74.71088698854776	-35.10769949068868	101954

48de6ab5702c32f49f05740532e9d3842394ca9f	rationing computing resources in a university environment	university environment;rationing computing resource	Back in the days of card punches, students punched their programs and data into computer cards and then vacated the card punch machine because there was nothing else the card punch could do. Occasionally a student might sit there long enough to multi-punch a design into a card or painstakingly punch a letter to their mother or friend. But outside of that there was little else they could do; little else to stimulate their curiousity and creativity. Thus, there was nothing to entice most students to spend hours utilizing the card punch. The advent of the on-line keyboard terminal and subsequent CRT’s and PC’s have changed all of that. While students still key in their programs and data, they now have at their fingertips a fascinating array of games, challenges and incentives to keep them occupied for hours, days, and even weeks. Recognizing the potential problems associated with a large number of students and a limited number of terminals, the staff of the Computation Center at Penn State University developed and implemented an innovative mechanism called RATION that dynamically monitors and controls the amount of connect time per day that a student may use to access the computer. This paper describes the RATION facility as it is implemented at Penn State University.	cathode ray tube;computation;online and offline;punched card input/output	John L.

""""Computational thinking"""" is the term often used to denote the conceptual core of computer science or """"the way a computer scientist thinks"""", as Wing put it. Such term - given also the lack of a widely accepted definition - has become a """"buzzword"""" meaning different things to different people. We investigated the Italian primary school teachers' conceptions about computational thinking by analyzing the results of a survey (N=972) conducted in the context of """"Programma il Futuro"""" project. Teachers have been asked to provide a definition of computational thinking and to answer three additional related closed-ended questions. The analysis shows that, while almost half of teachers (43.4%) have included in their definitions some fundamental elements of computational thinking, very few (10.8%) have been able to provide an acceptably complete definition.

At the same time, computer science educators are grappling with how to broaden participation. These two dilemmas are related, in that computer science can be used to teach many of the 21st century skills, and bringing computer science to all K-12 students can help broaden participation.  For computer scientists, key 21st century skills [4] include creativity & innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, communication & collaboration, information literacy, media literacy and information, communications and technology (ICT) literacy -- these skills go beyond traditional """"computational thinking"""" skills because they include reflections on how computation affects social processes (such as the role of computational media in society).  Since 2009, K-12 educators and computer science graduate students in the Engaging Computer Science in Traditional Education (ECSITE, pronounced """"excite"""") project have developed curricular units that are embedded into non-computing K-12 classes [3]. These units collectively address many 21st century skills, and have been introduced into arts, geography, government, health, music, and science classes. In this special session, we will interactively share some of our successful curricular units that address different 21st century skills, initiate a broader discussion on embedding computer science into K-12 curriculum and discuss methods we are exploring to enhance the sustainability of such efforts."""	amiga reflections;computation;computational thinking;computer science;embedded system;excite;information literacy;interactivity;problem solving	Debra Goldberg;Dirk Grunwald;Clayton Lewis;Jessica A.

The basic principles of mind mapping are described, including structural components of mind maps, and examples of practical use cases. Based on the identified lack of existing methodical frameworks for creating interactive mind maps for e-learning, we present a set of rules and metrics, which can help to identify points of ineffectiveness, and eliminate redundancies. This framework for creating effective mind maps and its implications are described in details with help of illustrative figures and textual description.

As these sites are social, they relate someone with others in a network. Thus there seems to emerge a new kind of self which exists in the online world. Accounting for the online self here also has implications on how the self in the outside world should be understood. It is argued that, as the use of online social media has become more widespread, the line between the two kinds of self is becoming fuzzier. Furthermore, there seems to be a fusion between the online and the offline selves, which reflects the view that reality itself is informational. Ultimately speaking, both kinds of selves do not have any essence, i.e., any characteristic inherent to them that serves to show that these selves are what they are and none other.

And in china, all china’s colleges and universities are trying their best to set up crossover education. Cause firstly they all think that it is vital important for the college students to broaden their horizon, secondly, more and more projects need diverse and professional genius to cooperate to be finished. They need to know the design thinking. But the problem is coming, differing from design-major background students, how to make design curriculum transforming a better and easier way to accept and assimilate by the other background students. How to cultivate the design thinking in crossover education, I think, which is the most things we as educator need to concentrate. This paper focuses on how to introduce inclusive design philosophy to non-design background undergraduates. This is one of the parts of a research project “Applied universities’ design education reform and practice based on the principle of inclusive design” supported by the Shanghai Education Science Research Program (Grant No. C17067) [1].

In brief, Science of Hadith is a study related to the knowledge about Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in Islamic believe. The main aim of the study is to verify the authentication of the story. Hadith contain not just the story, but also record the narrators (or transmitter) of it. One story can have several chains of narrators. This also means that one narrator can transmit several different stories about Prophet Muhammad. This paper describes preliminary results of our work on an Information Visualization approach to view the chain of Hadith narrators, which indirectly show the flow of story about the Prophet in interesting view. We developed a prototype of Chain of Hadith Narrators Visualizer (CHN) and tested it with 20 students of Islamic Education Programme. The findings of this study showedthat the information visualization approach is an appropriate tool to support the learning of Science of Hadith.

We have contributed with the global virtual anatomy course for teaching students in multiple locations with stereoscopic volume rendering, audio/video conferencing and additional materials. This year we focused on further simplifying the deployment of the classroom by using the new collaborative and web-based visualization system CoWebViz, to transfer stereoscopic visualization to the classrooms. Besides the necessary hardware installations for stereoscopy, only a web browser is necessary to view and to interact with the remote 3D stereo visualization. This system proved stable, gave higher quality images and increased ease of deployment. Its success within our classroom at the University of Chicago and Cardiff University has motivated us to continue CoWebViz development.	anatomic structures;audio media;deploy;imagery;internet;stereoscopy;volume rendering;web application	Mathias Kaspar;Fred Dech;Nigel M.

Technology adoption can be seen as consisting of both a social and technical system. This paper will provide a socio-technical analysis of an implementation of Second Life, an online virtual world, into an undergraduate English course at a large public university. The paper will 1) describe the pilot course, 2) analyze affinities from a socio-technical perspective, and finally 3) give recommendations based on lessons learned from implementing Second Life in an undergraduate English course. Introduction Members of organizations sometimes have differing goals in regards to instructional technology adoption. Different users have varying interests and it is especially true when looking at innovative technologies (Akerman, 2000). In a classroom adoption of a technology, students and teachers are not the sole users within a system. Users include instructional designers, technical managers, teaching assistants, technology trainers, and technology support personal. Each user is a node within the social system and each user may have a different interest in the adoption of a particular technology (Duggan, 2003). Instructional designers might have the goal of creating an open constructivist-teaching environment, while a technology manager may be more interested in creating a secure, private, tightly controlled environment in order to reduce risk. Instructional technology implementations consist of both technical and social networks, mutually constituted (Kling, 1991). This paper will provide a socio-technical analysis of an implementation of Second Life, an online virtual world, into an undergraduate English course at a large public university. The paper will 1) describe the pilot course, 2) analyze three affinities collected through a focus group (Sanchez, 2007) from a socio-technical perspective, and finally 3) give recommendations based on lessons learned from implementing Second Life in an undergraduate English course. Pilot course An undergraduate literature course consisting of eighteen students from various majors was selected to participate in a pilot implementation of Second Life, an online virtual world. The intent was to use Second Life as a tool to motivate students and to help them visualize the writing process. The main activity for the course was for students to build their ideal campus. Students participated in Second Life on a private island; only members of the course along with the instructor and two technical support staff could access the island. Because some students were not eighteen years old, all students were restricted from leaving the university’s private island. The course met for both the fall and spring semester, although the following data set is taken from work completed during the fall semester of 2006. Figure 1. Over view of UT Second Life Campus Lack of instructions Students received very little instruction during the course of their second life experience. Each student attended one training session where they were taught how to navigate through Second Life, alter the appearance of their avatar, and build simple shapes such as boxes and arches. Students were required to use the Second Life building tools known as “prims” to construct their buildings. They found the “prims”, which were shapes such as spheres, boxes, and cylinders, very difficult to use, a student noted, “it’s hard to create 3-D objects using such simple shapes. I had an idea for my buildings but I couldn’t make them using such simple shapes”. When the pilot was initially designed, an assumption was made that students would be able to quickly learn how to build structures in Second Life, and their status as “net generation” or “generation Y” (Weiler, 2005) learners would give them a natural ability to create in a 3D world. Because of the digital native assumption, the pilot study was designed in such a way as to let students learn by doing. If they encountered a problem it was anticipated that students would be able to collaborate in order to find solutions. Unfortunately, interview, survey, and focus group data indicated students never felt comfortable working in the 3D environment. The interface was very difficult for them to use and they were frustrated by the frequent downtime and weekly software upgrades required by Second Life. Lack of expert users The organization supporting Second Life did not have sufficient expertise in the software to provide appropriate instructional and technical consulting. This lack of expertise led to decision-making based on the possible use of Second Life rather than decision-making based on data stemming from actual use of Second Life. Additionally, support staff did not know how much time it would take or what kind of technical resources, bandwidth, processor speed, graphics cards, etc., would be necessary to complete an assignment. Lack of organizational expertise effected the implementation of Second Life in several ways. By the fourth week of class, students developed more sophisticated skills in Second Life than the assigned teaching assistant in the course. By the sixth week, students had already spent more time in Second Life than any staff members from the supporting organization. The supporting organization could no longer assist students with their work because the students knew more about the tool than they did. Students reported being frustrated on the Second Life campus because they couldn’t find anyone to help them when they needed it. One student said, “We didn’t really have any help and we were totally ignorant about the whole thing. We couldn’t go anywhere (to find it)”. Figure 2. Picture of University of Texas tower Lack of social interaction Second Life was thought of as a technical tool, not as a social tool. Because of this, support staff as well as the instructor spent most their time planning for the technical system within the 3D world. An example of this is how the students were first introduced to their virtual land. Students had access to sixteen virtual acres of land, all of which was empty except for a replica of the university’s clock tower. Other than that lone building, students were literally left on a deserted island with no trace of other people, places, or spaces. The island was created in such a way as to provide the most acreage of useable land for student building projects. This decision is an example of how organizations think of instructional technology as a mere technical system, the social component was ignored. The focus group revealed that students felt isolated on the island and they felt as if they were planted in a void (Sanchez, 2007). One student described how she tried to meet-up with other students on the island on a Sunday afternoon. The students met but they lacked a social space to gather at or an activity to participate in, so they decided to push each other off the top of buildings for fun. A student described the experience, “We would get together on Sundays and we couldn’t tell what to do so we would push each other around or off buildings”. The students were literally dying for social interaction! Students were disappointed with their lack of interaction with other Second Life residents, “It would have been more fun in the real SL rather than the UT island, the actual second Life game, there is more stuff to do, its not just a campus, it’s a whole world”. Students indicated feeling isolated when they entered Second Life. In one word a student described their first impression of Second Life, “Hell”, he elaborated further, “Eerie, nothing was there”. Lessons learned When implementing a virtual world such as Second Life it is important to consider both the social and technical systems. Based on information gathered from surveys, interviews, and focus groups, the following recommendations are provided. Supporting the technical system 1. Support staff should create documentation to assists users and publish the information both in the virtual space as well as on the web 2. Staff must be expert users in order to assist and provide guidance to students 3. Virtual spaces should have areas for users to be able to reach support staff 4. Support staff should routinely check-in with students to prevent the spread of misinformation Supporting the social system a. Interaction between students should be designed for instructional as well as social occasions. b. Social spaces should be created in the virtual environment to allow students to hold informal gatherings. Encourage the social use of the tool c. Staff should create a permanent residence in the virtual world so that students know where to find them. Virtual office hours and areas dedicated to demonstrating new products are two possible ways to encourage communication between users. d. Provide in-world activities for students such as building contest, obstacle courses, or scavenger hunts to help students get acclimated to the virtual environment. Many lessons were learned from the yearlong pilot study of Second Life. The most important however is that the implementation of 3D worlds in a university classroom must be thought of as a sociotechnical system. The technical system includes computers, networks, tutorials, hardware, and policy. The social system includes, creating social spaces, opportunities for in-word assistance, demonstrating the presence of others, continuous feedback loops from various users, and providing social as well as instructional activities.	avatar (computing);clock rate;computer;digital native;documentation;downtime;feedback;focus group;graphics;sl (complexity);second life;social network;social system;sociotechnical system;stemming;technical support;usability;video card;virtual reality;virtual world;web 2.0	Oliver Strohm;Eberhard Ulich	1997			organizational structure;procedure;project;performance;engineering;evaluation;sociotechnical system;methodology;organizational analysis;management;operations research;technology	HCI	-66.17691475193584	-24.285754315580604	105144

This process revolves around the steps through which the thoughtful productions of superior products are created. The ADDIE generic instructional design model emphasises five basic steps within the instructional design process: analyse, design, develop, implement and evaluate. The simplistic nature of the ADDIE model, including the ease of application and possibilities towards the cyclical features of the process, enable a more holistic overview of the instructional design process. The Eternal, Synergistic Design Model emphasises the nonlinear nature of the instructional design process. The continuous design and development focuses upon the core evaluation of the product, wherein the Pareto principle emphasises the feedback related to the 20% of difficulties while maintaining an eye upon the 80% neutral and positive aspects of the product. Introduction Instructional design can be defined through numerous viewpoints, yet the basic tenet of instructional design is the simplistic explanation revolving around the distinct systematic process through which evolves an instructional product. The history of instructional design evolved from inspiring beginnings: As a formal discipline, Instructional Systems Design has been a long time in the making. The early contributions of thinkers such as Aristotle, Socrates and Plato regarding the cognitive basis of learning and memory was later expanded by the 13th century philosopher St. Thomas Aquinas who discussed the perception of teaching in terms of free will. Four hundred years later, John Locke advanced Aristotle’s notion of human’s initial state of mental blankness by proposing that almost all reason and knowledge must be gained from experience. (Leigh, 2003, paragraph 1) 414 British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 35 No 4 2004 © British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, 2004. From these exhilarating initial stages, instructional design has developed into an artistic science. The exalted realm from which instructional design emerges develops easily towards the realm of details and processes, wherein the definition of instructional design can revolve around numerous perspectives: process, discipline, science and reality. Instructional design as a process may be defined as ‘systematic development of instructional specifications using learning and instructional theory to ensure the quality of instruction’ (Berger and Kam, 2003, paragraph 1). Instructional design as a discipline focuses more upon approaches and may be characterised as, ‘branch of knowledge concerned with research and theory about instructional strategies and the process for developing and implementing those strategies’ (Berger and Kam, 2003, paragraph 2), while instructional design as the science of ‘creating detailed specifications for the development, implementation, evaluation, and maintenance of situations that facilitate the learning of both large and small units of subject matter at all levels of complexity’ (Berger and Kam, 2003, paragraph 3). Lastly, instructional design as reality encompasses a more authentic view of the process, wherein instructional design can start at any point in the design process. Often a glimmer of an idea is developed to give the core of an instruction situation. By the time the entire process is done the designer looks back and she or he checks to see that all parts of the ‘science’ have been taken into account. Then the entire process is written up as if it occurred in a systematic fashion. (Berger and Kam, 2003, paragraph 4) As is suggested through the numerous perspectives quoted above, instructional design is viewed through many lenses; at the same time, there are several approaches through which to implement instructional design plans. Yet the focus of instructional design is the systematic process through which evolves a superior instructional product. By means of each of these definitions one primary role of instructional design is clear, which is the appropriate process through which an instructional product is developed, as delineated through an instructional design model. An instructional design model offers the developer an opportunity to create a sense of understanding, in the broadest sense of the word. Instructional design delineates a process to follow, through which a conception and understanding of the complex problem is derived. As instructional design models are prevalent, the focus is upon the model’s implementation. As there are numerous instructional design models to choose from, it is appropriate to offer an overview of instructional design models. As previously noted, instructional design models assist us in our endeavour towards making meaning of the world. Helping to construct meaning out of chaos, understanding out of the inexplicable and effortlessness out of the perplexing is the idyllic nature of the instructional design model. Instructional design models have been developed to fit into numerous theoretical models and philosophical expectations so as to most appropriately fit the needs, desires and expectations of the instructional designer. As such, several linear instructional design models have become standards within the Non-linear instructional design model: eternal, synergistic design and development 415 © British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, 2004. world of instructional design. Mager’s Criterion Referenced Instruction (Mager, 1984), Rapid Prototyping Design Model (Tripp and Bichelmayer, 1990), Dorsey, Goodrum and Schwen Model (Dorsey et al , 1997), Dick and Carey’s Systems Approach Model for Designing Instruction (Dick and Carey, 1996) and Gagné’s Instructional Design Theory (Gagné, 1977) each develop instructional design models that focus upon correlated philosophies and views of the world. The most recently introduced instructional design model is Hall, Watkins and Eller’s Model of Web-Based Design for Learning (Hall et al , 2003), as may have been inspired by the timeliness of electronic learning (e-learning) environments. This is neither appropriate nor inappropriate; it is merely noteworthy that instructional design principles have been a focus of attention for several hundred years, and instructional design models emerging only within the last 100 years, with each innovation introducing another model to the world of instructional design. A generic instructional design model known as ADDIE emphasises five basic steps within the instructional design process: analyse, design, develop, implement and evaluate. The simplistic nature of the ADDIE model, including the ease of application and possibilities towards the cyclical features of the process, enables a more holistic overview of the instructional design process. However, the mid-1990s began the reconceptualisation of instructional design models, as growing interest towards constructivism has introduced a less restrictive instructional design model (Willis, 1995) which emphasises the complex nature of the instructional design process within a real-world environment. Eternal, Synergistic Design and Development Model As an outgrowth of understanding the acknowledged instructional design models, I felt comfortable focusing my efforts and attention towards the design and development of my first e-learning course environment several years ago. I excitedly began my journey into the world of instructional design as it relates to e-learning course development. As I began designing and developing my first e-learning course, I realised that the realworld implementation of linear instructional design models was not within the realm of my nature. Willis’ (1995) constructivist-interpretivist instructional design model was much more appropriate towards a description of the ways in which I, and my course development team, were most creative and supported. As such, I began generating a model in the back of my mind that more appropriately met the needs of my own developmental needs and my philosophical conceptual framework of the instructional design process. Context The Eternal, Synergistic Design Model I present to the professional academic community within this manuscript addresses several needs to support my e-learning design and development requirements. This model is constructivist-interpretivist in nature, as is the Willis (1995) model, and offers a continual, synergistic growth process, with a central emphasis upon evaluation. The synergistic growth aspect of the instructional design model revolves around the birth, development and refinement of the product. Further, the model is somewhat symbolic in nature, as it includes the never-ending and 416 British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 35 No 4 2004 © British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, 2004. converging element of the eternity symbol that emphasises the continuous focus upon the design and development of the product. Following, the core focus is upon the end user or customer, as the design and development revolve around the evaluation and feedback so as to further enhance and refine the product. Design features The analysis stage of the traditional instructional design model focuses attention upon the learning objectives, an analysis of the customer, as well as several other imperative features of the analysis stage before focusing attention upon the design stage. Within the Eternal, Synergistic Design Model, I suggest that the analysis phase should be integrated into the design and development of the instructional design process so as to ensure that the analysis phase is continually addressed, considered and possibly revised. Secondly, within this instructional design model, the implementation of the product most appropriately occurs at numerous points throughout the instructional design process so as to ensure that formative evaluation and feedback is obtained throughout the design and development proce	consciousness;constructivist epistemology;continuous design;emergence;endeavour (supercomputer);feedback;glimmer;holism;imperative programming;nonlinear system;norm (social);pareto efficiency;rapid prototyping;refinement (computing);reflection (computer graphics);requirement;social constructivism;software design;subject matter expert turing test;synergy;systems design	Caroline Crawford	2004	BJET	10.1111/j.0007-1013.2004.00400.x	psychology;interaction;social science;simulation;developmental psychology;educational research;artificial intelligence;learning theory;methodology;instructional design;design education;pedagogy	HCI	-73.43688438857146	-36.91691188159617	105448

The present study explores the use of PBL in an online biotechnology course. In the PBL unit, student groups dealt with the ethical, legal, social, and human issues surrounding presymptomatic DNA testing for a genetic disease. Issues concerning implementation of PBL in the online environment are discussed, as are differences between online PBL and face-to-face PBL. This study provides evidence to suggest that PBL stimulates higher-order learning in students. However, student performance on a lower-level exam testing acquisition of factual knowledge was slightly lower for PBL students than for students who learned the same material through a traditional lecture-based approach. Possible reasons for this lower level of performance are explored. Student reactions and feedback to the PBL format yield more insight into issues surrounding the implementation of PBL in the online environment.	genetic algorithm;immersion (virtual reality);imperative programming;internet;scheduling (computing);seamless3d;streaming media;text-based (computing);word lists by frequency	Thomas S.

From the Chinese news stories, key terms (important words or phrases), known or new to existing lexicons, were first extracted by a simple, yet effective, rule-based algorithm. They were subjected to an association analysis based on their co-occurrence in sentences to reveal their term-to-term relationship. A given list of 3657 index terms from science textbooks were then matched against the term association network. The resulting term network (including 95 scientific terms) was visualized in a concept map to scaffold the instrument developers. When developing an item, the linked term pair not only suggests the topic for the item due to the clear context being mutually reinforced by each other, but also the content itself because of the rich background provided by the recurrent snippets in which they co-occur. In this way, the resulting instrument (comprised of 50 items) reflect the scientific knowledge revealed in the daily news stories, meeting the goal for measuring civic scientific literacy in media. In addition, the concept map mined from the texts served as a convenient tool for item classification, developer collaboration, and expert review and discussion.	concept map	Yuen-Hsien Tseng;Chun-Yen Chang;Shu-Nu Chang Rundgren;Carl-Johan Rundgren	2010	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2010.01.002	psychology;concept map;social science;content analysis;computer science;data science;computational linguistics;multimedia;sociology;communication;world wide web;pedagogy	NLP	-66.42421255733782	-35.99671740288113	106211

The study contends that the outward manifestation of PWU behaviors at the workplace is but one consequence of the actors' attitudes which in turn are determinants of their ingrained beliefs. This study explores user perceptions about PWU using a web-based Q-methodology. Q-methodology used in this study is suitable for exploratory research, to obtain a deeper and first-hand understanding about the underlying phenomena about an under-explored concept. Twenty-five participants were asked to sort 38 statements according to their relative importance. The results uncover three distinct factors PWU: (1) cyber-bureaucrat, (2) cyber-humanist, and (3) cyber-adventurer. This indicates that PWU maybe a multidimensional construct instead of a uni-dimensional one as previously thought. The findings of this study can help managers understand, and shape the perceptions of the users rather than the outwardly manifested behaviors.	attitude;humanist (electronic seminar);illness behavior;laryngeal web;oracle advanced queuing;q methodology;web application	Murugan Anandarajan;Narasimha Paravastu;Claire A.

Although the hugeness of the Web as well as its dynamic nature is a burden for the users, it will also bring them a chance for business and research if they can notice the trends or movement of the real world from the Web, which can not be found from a single document but from a sequence of document sets.	rare events	Yasufumi Takama	2003			social psychology	HCI	-62.87774117897615	-28.028161291487027	106308
ec6e38b94a6dee3050099d601b024aef7afd1eed	ebiomics - a website promoting good practices and specific methods for using bioinformatics resources		eBiomics (www.ebiomics.org) is an e-learning interactive platform in bioinformatics intended as a support to post-graduate students and scientists involved in -omics or systems biology projects. The heterogeneity and the multitude of bioinformatics resources (databases or tools) make their individual use and appreciation difficult though difficulties can be overcome through indexing examples of use in specific contexts. eBiomics is presented as a didactic guide for an extensive range of on-line databases and tools commonly referred to in -omics applications. In its self-training version, it was developed with a free content management system and contains light textual information complemented with numerous screenshots and visual information in a user-friendly environment. A collection of protocols and case studies is indexed for finding representative and practical usages of each of the resources described. Most references to on-line databases and tools are accessible in real time through cross-links. The content covers main -omics related topics. Such a flexible tool allows keeping up with the constant evolution imposed by frequent new releases of databases, upgrades of on-line software and regular changes of query interfaces, which usually precludes from publishing helpful tutorials in books and manuals (otherwise rapidly becoming obsolete). In addition, it offers access to a self-testing section. A complementing sister website focused on biomedical academic studies includes part of the self-training content in a different environment.	acm guide to computing literature;bioinformatics;book;content management system;database;omics;online and offline;screenshot;systems biology;usability	Frédérique Lisacek;Patrick Koks;Pascale Berthault;Grégoire Rossier;Guy Bottu;Jacques van Helden;Jean Sylvestre;Jean-Pierre Kraehenbuhl;Jack A.

df332a3db2e3d2794ca22d6cf50460837eedb8a3	toward inductive learning of energy-related concepts		Energy is an important topic in science and engineering. Yet, clear definitions of this concept are difficult to come by and, as a result, students often develop a limited understanding of energy and energy-related concepts. This is exacerbated by traditional, deductive means of teaching. In this paper, the authors report on an attempt at introducing an inductive approach to the teaching and learning of energy-related concepts, specifically conservation of energy. The approach was attempted among a select group of school students using inductive means, and was adapted from an article in the literature that addressed flight energy management training for pilots. The aim of the paper is to describe the intervention, which sought to foster a deeper understanding of energy flows within a system and place the school students in good stead for their subsequent design of an ultra-energy efficient hydrogen-powered vehicle. This is done in order to demonstrate how inductive learning can be enacted in an engineering curriculum. However, the intervention was implemented with a small sample of students and, as such, further attention needs to be given to how such an inductive learning approach can be incorporated into formal curricula at both school and university levels, with a diverse range of students, and with diverse topics.	hydrogen;inductive reasoning	Johan Meyer;Zach Simpson	2018	2018 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)	10.1109/EDUCON.2018.8363289	knowledge management;curriculum;engineering;engineering education;energy management	AI	-75.82846371589875	-35.126824017537984	106654

6592107c198aead6fac59535d47fd3c07bd5567a	pedagogical principle based e-learning exploration: a case of construction mediation training		E-learning increasingly serves institutes as a fundamental infrastructure that enables teachers to provide students with diverse knowledge and to strengthen interactions between teachers and students. In the implementation of e-Learning, one of the most essential prerequisites is the understanding of underlying pedagogy. Most e-learning providers perceive themselves as mere providers of technology. They seldom inform learners how to select learning materials to teach and learn. The learning path, as a routine to guide learner to select the appropriate learning material, is therefore a significant issue for considering any single learning path cannot adapt to all learners. Therefore, this paper proposes a new pedagogical principle-based e-learning framework for identifying customised learning paths. Based on the framework, a construction mediation training system is introduced. The system has pioneered such a learning path to guide learners to start at preferred position and make efficient bargaining exchange to achieve “win-win” settlement. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the e-learning system.

As a result, we propose a process scaffold that allows practitioners to switch between the two design approaches: rational design and creative and performative design.

Today, take a quick glance at the 3C stores; many electronic mobile devices are portable. Actually, a legendary manufacturing company, Corning, has developed a special glass product, named Gorilla Glass, which designed the glass for electronic lifestyles or 3C products[2]. Such products are: tablets, smartphones, MP3 players and other electronic wonders in the open market, which may suffer damage everyday by human neglects. Corning's Gorilla Glass (GG) stands up to abuse with scratch, and impact-resistant qualities. And Corning's approach allows the glass to be incredibly thin, and won't interfere with capacitance touch screens or add significant weight to a specific device. This research focus on preference of GG, and possible impacts for different groups of people. In our research, we collected more than 300 cases from the telephone survey during Jan., 2012 and March, 2012. Total of 200 cases complied with the conditions.

The goal is not to preserve a recording of the performance but to keep the work alive by providing the means to re-perform them. The purpose of this paper is to present the theoretical and practical outcomes of the documentation, dissemination and preservation of compositions with real-time electronics (DiP-CoRE) project. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology combines methods stemming from work psychology and ergonomics with conceptual frameworks constructed according to grounded theory. Data were collected during a six months’ creative process. Subsequent interviews were conducted during confrontations with documents, including observational recordings, sketches and technical specifications. Findings – This paper demonstrates the relevance of the proposed documentation methodology for the preservation of contemporary music with live electronics, focussing on the notion of intelligibility. It brings into light the multiple perspective of the documentation of the activity in a multi-agent creative process, which encompasses what was done but also what could have been done. Research limitations/implications – The DiP-CoRE project bring to light connections between the notion of intelligibility, the thickness of the activity and boundary objects. The paper proposes further directions of research in order to embed the designed framework within digital repositories. Practical implications – The documentation methodology, designed and tested in this paper, proposes a framework for practitioners, building on video-stimulated recall as well as documents produced during the creative process. This framework requires less expertise (but a more important technical setup) than a traditional interview-based documentation framework. It thus provides opportunities for various size organizations to build methodical documentation processes and to further build on distributed expertise with computer-supported collaborative work. Originality/value – This paper proposes a new interdisciplinary documentation methodology relevant in the artistic domain, which brings together transmission with objects and by practice. It specifically defines the relation between this proposal and a high-level model for digital curation, namely, the mixed methods digital curation model. It further creates a link between documentation best practice and the ongoing research in the tracking of creative processes.	best practice;case preservation;digital curation;digital library;documentalist;documentation;effective method;high- and low-level;human factors and ergonomics;industrial and organizational psychology;information science;information seeking behavior;intelligibility (philosophy);multi-agent system;nl (complexity);process (computing);real-time transcription;relevance;software development;stemming;technical standard;thickness (graph theory)	Guillaume Boutard	2016	Journal of Documentation	10.1108/JDOC-09-2015-0121	library science;social science;data curation;performance;computer science;linguistics;multimedia;world wide web;intelligibility;information retrieval	HCI	-63.626345168151296	-36.153480904137446	107679
1d5754d56dfbd2d85d3e859cff63e5844ca948ec	guest editorial informatics and electronics education: some remarks		This paper focuses on some vexed issues in the preparation of computer science (CS) curricula, including the systematization of the different areas of the technology, the definition of topics and subtopics to teach, their distribution across the various computing courses, and the relationships between them. It is a common opinion that such didactical difficulties are caused by the fast evolution of information technology. To show how this opinion has little ground, a comparison is made between the methods adopted by educators of informatics and of electronics; in fact, also the electronic technology advances at a similarly fast pace. This analysis brings evidence how the experts in electronics have a well-described theoretical basis that can be logically mapped and progressively taught to give a clear understanding of the field. The same cannot be said in CS. Educators in this field are not aided by underpinning theories in an effective manner. Experts have a mass of concepts at hand, but no network of logical connections to order them. This paper does not present a practical solution to these educational difficulties, but observes how the missing assistance of computer theorists may result in unnecessary expenditure of energy and considerable additional effort.	informatics	Paolo Rocchi	2016	IEEE Trans.

Research studies have demonstrated that early childhood educators face major challenges in selecting and updating developmental courseware that supports young children’s development. The primary purpose of this study was to assess children’s digital courseware employed in Jordanian kindergartens in accordance with developmentally appropriate courseware criteria. A random sample of 57 courseware programs employed in both public and private kindergartens was assessed using 10 criteria for developmentally appropriate courseware. The findings suggest that the courseware implemented in Jordanian kindergartens exhibited a moderate degree of appropriateness. The courseware was the most developmentally appropriate in the areas of “technical features” and “clear instruction,” while the real-work model and transformations were the least appropriate. Moreover, the findings revealed that children’s courseware implemented in public kindergartens was more developmentally appropriate than those in private kindergartens. These findings and their implications were discussed. Introduction In July 2003, the Jordanian Ministry of Education (MOE) launched an ambitious national initiative called Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy (ERfKE 1) to reform the educational system within the country, part of which concerned the provision and quality of early childhood education. The major government’s aim from ERfKE 1 includes improving teaching and learning through new curricula, expanding kindergartens and creating more facilities for them, and training teachers in new methods, computer literacy and education strategies using information and communication technology (Kaga, 2007; MOE, 2008). One of subcomponents of ERfKE 1 focused on the integration of technology into all educational stages, including kindergarten. The initial phase of ERfKE 1 ended in 2009, after 5.5 years of implementation. During that period, the MOE made great strides for applications of educational technology. The technology component was incorporated into the national kindergarten curriculum launched in 2004 (MOE & NCFA, 2004) and modified in 2006 (MOE, 2006). After expanding the number of public kindergartens across the country, the MOE introduced computer into the kindergartens’ environment as a fundamental corner alongside other educational corners (MOE & NCFA, 2004). In addition to the increase in the number of computers provided in British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 46 No 3 2015 649–663 doi:10.1111/bjet.12163 © 2014 British Educational Research Association	computer;moe;norm (social)	Fathi M.

It has a modern information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure that is maintained through a variety of ICT-based university committees. Notwithstanding this, the use of eLearning on campus is limited, and few mechanisms exist to promote or support its implementation. This is largely a result of the residential nature of the campus, traditionalism, and the volatile nature of current higher educational (HE) policies within South Africa. However, a core group of enthusiasts have spearheaded a number of initiatives over the past five years with limited institutional support. This paper presents the details of initiatives, university-wide and in the Department of Information Systems, to expose academic staff at the university to eLearning and describes the experience gained in the process.	information systems;volatile memory	Brenda Mallinson;David A.

Participants in this study agreed with some of the claims on a surface level but also described a deliberate and strategic approach to managing the distractions of technology in order to pursue their educational goals. This qualitative view of digital native students, as expressed in their own words, adds detail and additional nuance to the growing body of quantitative data that challenges the popular conception of the digital natives as a homogeneous generation with a common learning style.	digital native	Penny Thompson	2013	Education and Information Technologies	10.1007/s10639-013-9295-3	psychology;social science;interview;cognitive style;computer science;knowledge management;qualitative research;multimedia;sociology;management;social psychology;pedagogy;digital native	HCI	-72.40825361969011	-31.98293527629894	108098

Often seen as a discipline at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, business, and engineering, it has great interdisciplinary potential and practical appeal, allowing for recruitment of students who may not consider taking a CS0 or CS1 course. A special topics course in operations research was offered by the computer science department at Southwestern University as an upper-level elective, and it was also cross-listed as a business and mathematics elective. Not only did the course benefit computer science majors who appreciated the applications and different perspectives, but it provided a means for the department to serve a wider population, increased interdisciplinary education, and resulted in a filled-to-capacity upper-level course in computer science for the first time in recent memory. This course is now being considered as a permanent elective that will interest computer science majors and minors as well as draw in students from disciplines across campus. For departments with limited faculty resources for teaching non-major courses, offering an operations research course provides an alternative that simultaneously serves the department and the campus as a whole.	computer science;operations research	Barbara M.

bd91050cc765d9dc7bc4ffc8b730593301a50f84	functionalities provided by annotation systems for learners in educational context: an overview		During his activities, the learner usually uses comments, highlights and circles sections to tag consulted digital documents. Therefore, many systems have been developed to annotate different electronic resources, often adapted to specific users and for particular uses of documents. This great variety of annotation systems reveals a lack of a clear strategy of how to compare the developed annotation systems of the literature according to their functionalities. As a result, few works have tried to present comparative studies of these tools. The aim of this article is to provide a study of some annotation tools used by learners in educational practices. Therefore, we present a comparison of functionalities provided by forty annotation systems developed by industry and academia during the last decade. The study further reveals gaps in systems and opportunities for further research.

Drawing upon sociocultural perspectives on learning and critical ethnographic research methods, we examine students’ changing participation within middle school learning science. Our findings reveal the importance of """"place"""" in how and why these youth pursue science learning. We argue that one way in which place shapes their learning is in how the youth take up science as both a context and a tool for change. We look at two interrelated kinds of changes within the classroom: crafting new forms of participation and new points on entry into the science learning community, and redefining the purpose of science activity. We also argue these instantiations of place in learning serve to connect the worlds of youth with the worlds of school science."""	definition;domain of discourse;experience	Angela Calabrese Barton;Miyoun Lim;Edna Tan	2008			humanities;science education;knowledge management;experiential learning;political science;learning sciences;active learning;social science education;science, technology, society and environment education;outline of social science;pedagogy	HCI	-66.12005460098943	-33.28001085894214	108777

A qualitative method — a comparative analysis — was chosen for the study. The main research tool was a semi-structured interview, including specific and general questions regarding the participants' perceptions. Two mathematicians and five engineers participated in the study. Most of the lecturers perceive understanding as location — creation of a knowledge system with internal and external connections between its parts. The lecturers of the engineering disciplines emphasize the applicative trait of understanding — the ability to use this system. The participants described different activities and feelings, which might provide for their understanding, and their pedagogical approaches in teaching for understanding. Hence, they expressed doubts about the possibility to know be certain that their students understand.	applicative programming language;knowledge-based systems;qualitative comparative analysis;semiconductor industry	Elena Trotskovsky;Ira Raveh;Nissim Sabag	2018	2018 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)	10.1109/EDUCON.2018.8363291	knowledge management;trait;feeling;engineering	SE	-74.44271682776163	-32.311040723289366	109243

Such teams rely heavily on ICT to facilitate communication. There are many communication tools and technologies to choose from. This study investigates the effectiveness of a rich set of tools and considers if synergy exists between them. This paper reports and analyses the use of communication tools by students in a distributed Problem-based Learning (dPBL) environment. The PBL teams consisted of four students from Singapore and four from the UK. Teams had a rich set of synchronous and asynchronous communication tools available to them, including ISDN videoconference, WebCam video/audio, Microsoft NetMeeting® Chat, Asynchronous drop box and threaded discussion Forum. This ethnographic study showed that semantic discussion threads included the use of all tools and enabled students to effectively co-construct meaning (and understanding). Students were able to deploy the use of different tools effectively to achieve the learning outcomes intended for various stages in the PBL cycle, with both asynchronous and synchronous media being considered of high importance.	conversation threading;integrated services digital network;synergy;webcam	Chew Swee Cheng;Chris Beaumont	2004		10.1145/1007996.1008011	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;asynchronous communication;multimedia;synchronous learning	HCI	-77.36584602462592	-37.66957085387106	109714

We introduce the model of Deliberative Inquiry based on Habermas' Theory of Communicative Action as a way to create an additional form of positive inquiry. We argue that Deliberative Inquiry and Appreciative Inquiry naturally complement and support each other in providing a suitable approach to positive design. Whereas the flagship contribution of Appreciative Inquiry is a breakaway from deficit-oriented thinking and a focus on life-generating forces, Deliberative Inquiry's hallmark is the elimination of artificially imposed constraints through rational discourse. Appreciative Inquiry seeks strengths from positive emotions, while Deliberative Inquiry employs positive critique to unmask barriers to change and arrive at morally, ethically and pragmatically sound decisions by mutual and authentic agreement. We conclude by raising some guiding questions for the possibility of providing computer support for such inquiring systems.		Zaheeruddin Asif;Heinz K.

There is an emerging concern about major robot vulnerabilities and their adverse consequences. However, there is still a considerable gap between robotics and cybersecurity domains. For the purpose of filling that gap, the present technical report presents the Robotics CTF (RCTF), an online playground to challenge robot security from any browser. We describe the architecture of the RCTF and provide 9 scenarios where hackers can challenge the security of different robotic setups. Our work empowers security researchers to a) reproduce virtual robotic scenarios locally and b) change the networking setup to mimic real robot targets. We advocate for hacker powered security in robotics and contribute by open sourcing our scenarios. .	charge trap flash;computer security;emoticon;open-source software;robot;robotics	Gorka Olalde Mendia;Lander Usategui San Juan;Rowaida H Ali;Asier Bilbao Calvo;Alejandro Hernández Cordero;Irati Zamalloa Ugarte;Aday Muñiz Rosas;David Mayoral Vilches;D Michael;Laura Alzola Kirschgens;Victor Mayoral Vilches;Endika Gil-Uriarte	2018	CoRR		hacker;knowledge management;robot;human–computer interaction;architecture;robotics;technical report;artificial intelligence;computer science	Robotics	-68.19660668743973	-31.71340379029954	109916

These changes can be traced very differently, depending on whether the context is stable or dynamic. The purpose of this poster is to introduce a distinction between horizontal and vertical transitions that can be used to describe individual and institutional change in technology-rich environments. We argue that these two types of transitions trace different phenomena: Vertical transitions occur when individuals, technologies, or domains develop in stable and fixed conditions within set boundaries. In contrast, horizontal transitions occur when individuals, technologies, or domains mature in the synergy with other fields. We develop our argument by working through relevant studies in medicine, and close by outlining implications for future research on professional technology enhanced learning.

She was the driving force behind the publication of the 1945, 1960, and 1969 national standards for school libraries. Her imprint is evident in the research and philosophical foundations for the 1975, 1988, and 1998 national standards. Early Years and Education in Librarianship Born in Springfi eld, Illinois, on October 11, 1906, Henne received her bachelor of arts degree and master of arts degree in English at the University of Illinois in 1929 and 1934 respectively. After completing her undergraduate degree and while she was working on her master’s degree, she worked as a library assistant in circulation and reference at the Lincoln Public Library in her hometown of Springfi eld from 1930 to 1940. In 1935 Henne went to New York City to pursue a bachelor’s degree in librarianship at Columbia University. While engaged in her studies, Henne also briefl y worked as a circulation assistant at the New York Public Library in 1935 and then as a reference and circulation assistant at the New York State Teachers College at Albany from 1935 to 1938. She served as an instructor in school librarianship at Albany from 1937 to 1939, when Louis Round Wilson, dean of the Graduate Library School (GLS) at the University of Chicago, invited her to serve as an instructor there and to be responsible Diane D. Kester, Chair, Department of Librarianship, Educational Technology, and Distance Instruction, College of Education, East Carolina University, 102 Joyner East, Greenville, NC 27858, and Plummer Alston Jones, Jr., Associate Professor, Department of Librarianship, Educational Technology, and Distance Instruction, College of Education, East Carolina University, 102 Joyner East, Greenville, NC 27858 953 kester and jones/frances henne for the library in the University High School, a laboratory school for the University of Chicago. University of Chicago Beginning her career as the fi rst woman faculty member at University of Chicago’s GLS in 1939, she also began her doctoral studies that same year. She served as librarian from 1939 to 1942. She participated in, and contributed to the proceedings of, the 1940 Conference on Reading, one of several annual conferences sponsored by and held at the University of Chicago throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Her paper, “Function and Activities of Libraries in Promoting Growth in and through Reading” (1940) was the fi rst of approximately thirty articles, essays, chapters, and monographs written throughout her career on reading, school libraries, school library research, school library standards, and print and nonprint media for children and young adults (Henne, 1942, 1943, 1950, 1950/1970; Henne & Lowell, 1942). She was assistant professor at the GLS from 1946 to 1949, served as associate dean and dean of students from 1947 to 1950, and acting dean from 1951 to 1952. In 1949, while serving as associate dean and dean of students, Henne received her doctorate degree in library science at the University of Chicago. Her dissertation, “Preconditional Factors Affecting the Reading of Young People” (1949a) recommended that high school libraries should reappraise their programs to stress appropriate selection and accessibility of materials and participate in the developmental reading programs and systematic reading guidance programs (Cole, 1955; Sullivan, 1990; Hannigan, 1993). During her teaching career at the University of Chicago Graduate Library School, which lasted from 1939 to 1954, Henne allied herself with other school library practitioners and state supervisors of school libraries, notably Mary Peacock Douglas of North Carolina, Ruth Ersted of Minnesota, and Margaret Walraven of Texas. Henne established the Center for Children’s Books and its Bulletin, a reviewing medium that related books to curriculum and analyzed critically children’s and young adults’ materials for libraries and schools (Cole, 1955; Sullivan, 1990; Hannigan, 1993; Schlachter and Thomison, 1974, p. 43). At this time she was a member of an American Association of School Librarians (AASL) committee, chaired by Mary Peacock Douglas, which was hard at work producing standards for school libraries. Leaders like Douglas and Henne recognized that national guidelines were needed to establish best practice through demonstration programs and to encourage nationwide measures of effort and achievement. Since school libraries were part of the evaluation process of regional accrediting associations, it was especially important to have guidelines and standards and to get them adopted by the accrediting agencies (Henne, 1943; Sullivan, 1990). As of 1943, there 954 library trends/spring 2004 were two sets of national standards for school libraries, including the fi rst standards for school libraries written by the National Education Association (NEA) Committee on Library Organization and Equipment for senior and junior high schools in 1920, and the 1925 Elementary School Library Standards, published as a joint collaboration of the NEA and the American Library Association (ALA) (Certain, 1920, 1925). In her 1943 article on “The Evaluation of School Libraries,” Henne called for new standards for both elementary schools and high schools. 1945 School Library Standards In 1945 the AASL school library standards committee published the fi rst set of national K–12 school library standards, School Libraries for Today and Tomorrow (Douglas 1945). The 1945 standards established the precedent for modern school library media programs by differentiating between the duties of the school librarian and those of the public librarian as well as defi ning the scope of the different services that the school library and the public library provided to schools (Douglas, 1945). Henne advocated collaborating with classroom teachers to include library skills education in the context of subject-based learning. An example of how this collaboration worked was The Librarian and the Teacher of Home Economics, published in 1945 by the ALA. This presented the results of Henne’s collaboration with a home economics teacher, Margaret Pritchard, to provide activities and examples to show how planning with teachers could make the library experience more meaningful in the classroom situation (Henne & Pritchard, 1945). In August 1947 Henne directed the GLS conference, “Youth, Communication, and Libraries,” the papers for which were published by the ALA under the same title. Youth, Communication, and Libraries includes Henne’s essay, “The Frontiers of Library Service for Youth,” which addressed the issue of where best to locate library services to children and young adults (Henne, 1949b). Henne championed the idea that school libraries, not public libraries, should be the primary source for library service to elementary school children. She urged school librarians, teacher educators, and library educators to continue to evaluate programs in the schools and in the universities and to plan locally, regionally, and nationally to attain the best possible library media programs in schools (Henne, 1949b; Sullivan, 1990; Hannigan, 1993; Frontiers of library service, 1979). Peggy Sullivan, in her biographical sketch of Henne, speculates that Henne overstated her position in this essay on the centrality of the elementary school library in the provision of library service to children. Sullivan points out that in her zeal to improve school libraries Henne angered public librarians who had their own traditions of providing children’s services (Sullivan, 1990). It was indeed evident that Henne was ready for any turf 955 kester and jones/frances henne battles for library services to youth that lay ahead when she asserted that “We must provide . . . the ideals, the force, the zeal, the spirit, the hard work, and, yes, the toughness, that form the dynamics which turn visions and plans into workable realities” (Henne, 1949b, p. 209; Hannigan, 1993, p. 347). American Association of School Librarians (AASL) The period of the late 1940s and early 1950s was a diffi cult time organizationally for the American Library Association and the AASL’s relationship with it. Henne was an AASL board member from 1945 to 1947 and, in what was a critical period organizationally, vice-chair from 1947 to 1948 and chair from 1948 to 1949. In the early 1940s the AASL was part of the ALA’s Division of Libraries for Children and Young People. Henne was a strong proponent of the idea that AASL should have autonomous divisional status within ALA with its own executive secretary (Sullivan, 1990; Hannigan, 1993). Since the 1920s a number of committees had been appointed to determine what the best structure would be for the association. The Fourth Activities Committee was set up in 1945, and among the recommendations of its 1948 report was to keep the Division of Libraries for Children and Young People but to separate the AASL from it as its own separate division. Henne was very active politically in these developments and was a member of the ALA Council when the report of this committee was considered. The long process of review and debate about all of this ended in 1951 when AASL became a separate division of ALA (Woolls, 2003; Lowrie, 1986, p. 734). In order to help school libraries implement the 1945 school library standards, Henne, along with Ruth Ersted, who was then state supervisor of school libraries in Minnesota, and Alice Lohrer, assistant professor at the Library School of the University of Illinois, wrote A Planning Guide for the High School Library Program. Published by ALA in 1951, this was the fi rst evaluative guide for school library programs (Henne, Ersted, and Lohrer, 1951). The Planning Guide provided a pattern for developing school library evaluation materials, including those used for self-studies for regional accreditation of schools, that continued to be 	accessibility;autonomous robot;best practice;book;centrality;dalton pritchard;frances yao;generalized least squares;graph toughness;jones calculus;librarian;library (computing);library science;mary tsingou;precondition;primary source;public library;ruth teitelbaum;teacher-librarian;university of chicago graduate library school	Diane D.

Some research towards the identification and model of user’s Emotions have been done by Affective Computing researchers, however Personality Traits have been quite neglected. The World Wide Web is an enormous source of products and services available for people. There is a huge effort done by scientists towards the creation of effective strategies to personalize those products/services for each people interested in using them. By storing Personality Traits in User Profiles we intend to enable Recommender Systems in order to deduce more interesting recommendations for users acting proactively to offer them products/services as a consequence of a prediction of their future needs and behaviors. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose the interpretation, modeling, formalization, storing and application of Personality Traits in User Profile, followed by an experimentation developed in the context of Recommender Systems.

0635437547f2fec6778a815f48aedb10c8d1b07e	a middle-school module for introducing data-mining, big-data, ethics and privacy using rapidminer and a hollywood theme		Today's organizations, including online businesses, use the art of data-driven decision-making i.e. business-intelligence (BI) to benefit from all the data out in the open. Given the current market demand for BI skill-sets, including the knowledge of different sources and tools for data-collection plus processing, today's youth need a basic understanding of data-driven intelligence, and an awareness of big-data related ethics and privacy. However, there has been limited research and development work towards designing an effective educational module in this regard at the K-12 level. We intend to address this particular limitation by presenting a uniquely engaging middle-school learning module based upon a combination of useful topics, like data-mining, predictive-analytics, data-visualization, big-data, ethics and privacy, using the free RapidMiner software-tool. The novelty of our module lies in the use of a GUI-based visual hands-on platform (RapidMiner), a Hollywood movie-theme based educational activity, as well as an added focus on big-data ethics and privacy, and its conceptual mapping to the NSA-GenCyber security-first principles. We discuss and analyze the survey data obtained from over hundred participants through several offerings of our module as an educational workshop through our Google-IgniteCS and NSA-GenCyber programs. The collected learning-analytics data indicate that our module can become a simple yet effective means for introducing data-mining, big-data, ethical and privacy issues, and GenCyber security-first principles at the middle-school level. Our results show prospects of motivating middle-school participants towards further learning of topics in data-science, data-ethics and data-security, which is necessary today in a variety of professions.	big data;data mining;data science;data security;data visualization;graphical user interface;hands-on computing;hollywood;information privacy;rapidminer	Amber Dryer;Nicole Walia;Ankur Chattopadhyay	2018		10.1145/3159450.3159553	knowledge management;novelty;survey data collection;computer science;data mining;big data;hollywood	AI	-66.15598218958061	-30.445956587873912	110665

Specifically, the introduction of virtual technologies in museums runs up against the issue of the situated character of information use. Across a number of disciplines (anthropology, sociology, psychology, cognitive science) there is growing recognition of the ‘situatedness’ of knowledge and its importance for the design and use of technology. This awareness is fostered by the fact that technological developments are often associated with disappointing gains for users. The effective use of technology relies on the degree to which it can be embedded in or congruent with the ‘local’ practices of museum users. Drawing upon field research in two museums of science and technology, both of which are in the process of introducing virtual technologies and exploring the possibilities of on-line access, findings are presented which suggest that the success of such developments will depend on the extent to which they are informed by detailed understanding of practice-practices that are essentially socially constituted in the activities of museum visitors and the daily work of museum professionals.	cognitive science;embedded system;field research;online and offline;relevance;situated	Terry Hemmings;Dave Randall;Dave Francis;Liz Marr;Colin Divall;Gaby Porter	1997	Archives and Museum Informatics	10.1023/A:1009007316752	information and communications technology;organizational culture;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;archaeology;computer-supported cooperative work;multimedia;management;world wide web;science, technology and society	HCI	-65.4195348366522	-33.36092399991571	110998
214e6eb60b7469d84bcbaf2954006d21ee7b8289	personal expressive bibliography in the public space of cultural heritage institutions	information management system;universal access;cultural heritage;public space	Through their composition, arrangement and description, collections of objects and information resources, including those held by libraries, archives, and museums, tell a form of story; principles of selection, organization, and description produce an interpretive frame that shapes the meaning of each collection. Within cultural heritage institutions, however, such effects may run counter to longstanding goals and values. While interoperable information management systems, for example, facilitate universal access, the goal of interoperability constrains the generation of distinctively expressive descriptive systems. User-supplied collections of citations, however, are free to exploit a wider communicative potential of collecting and describing than those from the institutional perspective, and can provide an intriguing counterpoint to it. This article examines three means by which such personal, expressive bibliographies may communicate differently from institutional collections: through eclectic goals for collecting and describing, through a unique authorial voice, and through engagement with emotional experience. Expressive bibliographies that display such characteristics exhibit the combination of control and ambiguity that Umberto Eco (2009) calls the poetry of lists. Introduction Deep within its website, the Seattle Art Museum (SAM) makes available several organized sets of descriptive information about its holdings, as selected, arranged, and annotated by patrons. One showcases a group of items according to color; another characterizes particular objects as 589 feinberg/personal expressive bibliography instructive for a teenager’s homeschooling. A third set identifies works that the author was surprised to find at SAM. Similarly, the University of Pennsylvania library catalog’s PennTags system enables users to create themed collections, or “projects.” Subjects range from sociology research techniques and machinima as fan culture to resources selected for Penn courses (“Psychology 200”). As documents, these bibliographies—which seems their most precise name, as they select and arrange citations to other materials—enable the creation of a focused, distinctive attention that turns metadata into a form of creative communication and a supplementary access mechanism to what is provided by the sponsoring institution. Bibliography, in its sense as collecting, classifying, and arranging citations, seems an old-fashioned type of scholarly exercise, its utility perhaps obsolete in a world of search engines and automatic links to materials. But the Web’s surfeit of networked information has made filtering take on a new importance, especially filtering that exhibits discernment and flair. One reason for the popularity of social software systems such as LibraryThing and Flickr has, I think, been their ability to supply a human element to information management, to reinvigorate compilation with creativity. As they anticipate potential audiences, citation compilers become authors, transforming private lists into coherent public expression. A Facebook profile is not merely a list of contacts as one might maintain in a private desk drawer; with its public audience and associated communicative purpose, Facebook becomes a bibliography of friends, where selection and arrangement principles create meaning in the assembled group. I call these personal collections of citations, selected, organized, and described by users, “expressive bibliographies,” because, unlike traditional bibliography, these collections may be designed to express the unique perspective of their authors toward the material that they collect and arrange. While expressive bibliographies may incorporate user-supplied	archive;bibliographic index;coherence (physics);compiler;contact list;expressive power (computer science);flickr;information management;interoperability;library (computing);machinima;software system;web search engine;world wide web	Melanie Feinberg	2011	Library Trends	10.1353/lib.2011.0023	psychology;library science;universal design;computer science;engineering;cultural heritage;management information systems;multimedia;sociology;communication;management;world wide web	Web+IR	-67.02740033065452	-30.659488163276485	111061

The primary focus will be on the videogame. The premise is that suspending disbelief at narrative improbabilities is a skill required to construct narrative coherence. Constructing narrative coherence of stories that contain virtual elements entails supplementary suspension of disbelief at virtual improbabilities, suspension of virtual disbelief. Since increasing the degree of virtuality often increases the requisite traversal effort, virtuality can be said to set increased demands on story traversal as well. This results in the dilemma of virtual balance: while virtuality has the potential to strengthen diegesis, it on the other hand sets heightened demands on story traversal and narrative coherence. The concluding argument is that these heightened demands may be turned into rhetorical tools.	categorization;coherence (physics);lecture notes in computer science;narrative designer;springer (tank);tree traversal;virtuality (gaming)	Veli-Matti Karhulahti	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-34851-8_1	social science;simulation;artificial intelligence;sociology;management;social psychology;literature	HPC	-62.98770196353688	-30.655936776697864	111118

First, we choose paper tools for the prototype of our experiment, to find out the design thinking mode of high school students. Second, we used the keywords analysis system to extract keywords and to analyze the thinking process. The result showed that starting with storytelling and cooperating with technical needs is more suitable for students to develop their innovative thinking.	prototype	Zhiyong Fu;Jiaqiu He;Chiju Chao	2018		10.1145/3202667.3206097	thinking processes;storytelling;knowledge management;design elements and principles;popularity;engineering;design thinking	HCI	-68.11064267058192	-37.163197272985144	111191

The research sought to determine the differences in the perceived usefulness of CBIR technologies among image user groups from several domains and explicate the reasons given regarding the utility of CBIR systems for their professional tasks. Twenty participants archaeologists, architects, art historians, and artists, individuals who rely on images of cultural materials in the performance of their work, took part in the study. The findings of the study reveal that interest in CBIR methods varied among the different professional user communities. Individuals who showed an interest in these systems were primarily those concerned with the formal characteristics i.e., color, shape, composition, and texture of the images being sought. In contrast, those participants who expressed a strong interest in images of known items, images illustrating themes, and/or items from specific locations believe concept-based searches to be the most direct route. These image users did not see a practical application for CBIR systems in their current work routines.	content-based image retrieval	Joan E.

The two approaches are possibility combined in one educational context. From this sense, a case on Web 2.0 employed at Aalborg University, Denmark where has a long history of PBL model is discussed in this paper. This case indicates that ICT may offer students in PBL personal tools for knowledge construction, reflecting, sharing and collaboration in project work, while also connecting to communities, network and resources of their own interest. Relating this case to the challenges of sustainability of education development in developing countries, some practical issues will be discussed in the countries such as India, Thailand and China.	email;web 2.0	Chunfang Zhou;Aparna Purushothaman;Nikorn Rongbutsri	2013	iJET		information and communications technology;computer science;knowledge management;sustainability;pedagogy	HCI	-74.80904738095408	-34.8474005204016	111546

In this direction they make considerable investments for constructing and operating e-participation websites; however, the use of them has been in general limited and below expectations. For this reason governments, in order to widen e-participation, should investigate the exploitation of the numerous users-driven Web 2.0 social media as well, which seem to be quite successful in attracting huge numbers of users. This paper describes a methodology for the exploitation of the Web 2.0 social media by government organizations in the processes of public policies formulation, through a central platform-toolset providing interoperability with many different social media, and enabling posting and retrieving content from them in a systematic centrally managed and machinesupported automated manner (through their application programming interfaces (APIs)). The proposed methodology includes the use of ‘Policy Gadgets’ (Padgets), which are defined as micro web applications presenting policy messages in various popular Web 2.0 social media (e.g. social networks, blogs, forums, news sites, etc) and collecting users’ interactions with them (e.g. views, comments, ratings, votes, etc.). Interaction data can be used as input in policy simulation models estimating the impact of various policy options. Encouraging have been the conclusions from the analysis of the APIs of 10 highly popular social media, which provide extensive capabilities for publishing content on them (e.g. data, images, video, links, etc.) and also for retrieving relevant user activity and content (e.g. views, comments, ratings, votes, etc.), though their continuous evolution might pose significant difficulties and challenges.	application programming interface;blog;interaction;internet;interoperability;simulation;social media;social network;web 2.0;web application;world wide web	Yannis Charalabidis;George Gionis;Euripidis Loukis	2010			semantic interoperability;interoperability;computer science;database;internet privacy;ws-i basic profile;cross-domain interoperability;world wide web	Web+IR	-70.61503397622344	-24.740170189932616	111743

These inherited technologies include wireless connectivity, Internet access and ultraportability. The combination of these and other technologies is forming a new class of devices known as information appliances (IAs). IAs-a class of products that also includes Web-enabled TVs-are related to desktop computers, but unlike network computers, IAs aren't crippled PCs. IAs are a separate class of devices defining new sets of applications. In fact, they are defining several new categories of computing. Initially, these devices will add functionality to the two killer applications of consumer electronics: television and e-mail. Eventually, however, they will pull away from the more obvious extensions (like wireless handhelds and e-mail-enabled cellular phones) and find their way into cars, wristwatches, kitchen appliances, and just about anything else that can be made more useful by extending typical capabilities with new technology. Every appliance will eventually become an IA, but not as soon as some people think. The challenge for vendors is how to design and manufacture extremely easy-to-use yet sophisticated devices at prices that will attract the masses. The technical hurdles are great and the market risks are clear, but the rewards will be huge. This tension is perfect for fomenting the next revolution in computing.	information appliance	Ted G.

Often it is the local residents themselves who have the most current and accurate understanding of the uses and condition of any place. Including diverse voices is difficult in the planning process, as many local groups do not have access to the same technologies as larger institutional actors. To address their needs, we have developed Local Ground: a tool that allows local residents to document their personal knowledge of places using simple bar-coded paper maps, computer vision techniques and free, publicly available mapping and charting tools. Users annotate paper maps using simple pens, markers and stamps. These maps are scanned and aggregated online, where they can be analyzed and overlaid on information obtained from other knowledge sources, allowing local perspectives to influence planning decisions. We tested Local Ground with a group of high school youth involved in an urban revitalization project in a low-income neighborhood in Richmond, California. Students and teachers found our tools to be portable, fun, collaborative, and easy to learn. In this paper we describe the Local Ground toolkit, including its strengths as a geo-spatial data collection and dissemination tool, and some findings obtained from our initial field pilot in Richmond.	computer vision;dynamic energy budget;map;plausibility structure;schematic;software documentation	Sarah Van Wart;K.

Educating children in making activities has also become advocated. Studies have reported experiences on engaging children in making activities and the importance of nurturing a maker identity in children has been advocated. This study reveals findings from a case where, in the spirit of genuine participation of children, 10--12-year-old children gained initial experiences in design and making activities within an elective mathematics class as part of their primary school education. The study shows that children adopted multiple subject positions and relied on various discourses when describing their experiences. We argue that none of them developed a designer or a maker identity as such during the project, whereas many of the children reported of having developed some sort of meaningful relationship to design and making. We argue that this is a valuable outcome per se. Implications for HCI research and design are discussed.	experience;game-maker;human–computer interaction	Netta Iivari;Marianne Kinnula;Tonja Molin-Juustila	2018		10.1145/3202185.3202742	maker movement;multimedia;pedagogy;computer science	HCI	-62.902567336495785	-35.81967384863985	111889

In this sense, constant evolution of assistive technologies helps users with disabilities to have a complete set of choices to access digital content while working with Virtual Learning Environments (VLE), but an intense training for stakeholders involved in curriculum design should be prepared to achieve an integral inclusive solution. This article proposes an innovative practice to implement, validate and promote a working methodology to produce an inclusive curriculum design, where teachers and staff administrators have a relevant role while designing, preparing and imparting accessible and inclusive courses. Teachers need to be instructed on how to generate accessible documents and how to provide truly accessible curriculum developments. This work presents an initiative promoted by ESVI-AL project, looking to improve accessibility in virtual higher education through the definition of systematic and replicable methodological processes for the design and implementation of accessible virtual curriculum developments. A first training experience for teachers in Latin-America is presented.	accessibility;assistive technology;digital recording	Hector R.

3c3bc463c38d6bd11978bea309ed460911f28d0c	a culturally aware rescue model for natural disasters		Motivated by shortcomings witnessed in recent natural disasters responses; this paper reports on a computational approach that offers techniques for matching social demands of a disaster type with the strengths of human cultural traits among rescue teams. Salient cultural parameters are nominated and an approach for using them in a decision making environment that has the potential for best match between tasks that require certain human capacities with available resources. In our current prototype we used somewhat generic traits as well as general requirements for illustration purposes. The stable matching algorithm is adapted to obtain the allocation of tasks for rescue groups. Our methodology heralds a novel blue print for avoiding miscommunications that are commonplace due to inappropriate assignment of people to tasks. For each disaster, or at least for each category of disaster, specific traits and requirements need to be carefully identified. For successful matching, steps we outline may be followed. We are planning on further studies that validate our methodology reported in this paper with more refined details.	algorithm;blueprint;computation;embedded system;interaction;prototype;requirement;stable marriage problem	Henry Hexmoor;Deepti Shetty	2012	IJCSA		salient;data mining;computer science;natural disaster;big five personality traits and culture	ECom	-64.02055779585564	-36.404291019017684	112132

Many models of collaborative learning such as The Structural Approach to Cooperative Learning (Spencer Kagan), have been tested at universities. Collaborative learning (CL) is directly linked to information and communication technologies (ICT) that seem to be the best environment for this form of learning. This review article seeks to define the structures of the CL model in the higher education environment, the basic elements of it and the strengths and weaknesses and to give examples of good practice.

55c13c9ca27d4235c0ee12eceb2e907fb900505c	"""""""things my doctor never told me"""": bridging information gaps in an online community"""		In a medical climate where doctors are usually pressed for time, patients commonly leave their appointments feeling confused, unable to recall what was discussed, or simply missing information. These communication difficulties result in gaps in patients’ knowledge about their conditions and their potential treatments. One response to this problem has been that patients join online health communities as a way to access more information and obtain social support. Research shows that participating in these communities has important benefits, including decreased depression, better ability to cope, and increased social networks that can aid in accessing needed information. However, little research addresses the specific information gaps patients experience, how they fill these gaps through online communication, and how online health information behavior interacts with medical decisions and patient-provider communication. Drawing on data from 31 semi-structured, in-depth interviews, participant observation, and online archives analysis, this paper examines the health information interactions that participants in an online breast cancer community experienced as they progressed through breast cancer and survivorship. The findings reveal an extensive array of information that, from the patients’ perspectives, was either not communicated or was inadequately communicated during patient-provider interactions. This research highlights patients’ perceptions of information gaps, how patients navigated through their information gaps with the help of the community, and the significance of peer interaction in the comprehension of medical information and medical decision-making.	archive;bridging (networking);computer-mediated communication;information access;information behavior;interaction;online community;semiconductor industry;social network;social support	Ellen L.

An effective way to bring about change may be to identify instances of best practice and then study associated strategies that may be useful for teachers trying to use computers in new and meaningful ways. This study investigates strategies used by a teacher deemed to be exemplary at using computers and associated technology in her classroom. It involved observing and recording teaching sessions conducted by the teacher. This paper discusses the learning task, the children's progression through the task and the teaching strategies used. In particular, it looks for instances of teacher scaffolding as a strategy for supporting children working with computers.	best practice;color gradient;computer;scaffold (programming)	Jennifer Masters;Nicola Yelland	2001	Education and Information Technologies	10.1023/A:1020909404405	mathematics education;knowledge management;primary education;management;pedagogy;best practice	HCI	-74.44254424930608	-36.692576393563726	112571

Less often remarked, however, are the social and political debates that it will engender, if and when the technologies become widely accepted. As the SW is a technology for transferring information and knowledge efficiently and effectively, then many of these questions have an epistemological base. In this paper I want to focus especially on the epistemological underpinnings of these social issues, to think about the interaction between the epistemological and the political. How does technology affect the social networks in which it is embedded? How can technology be successfully transplanted into a new context? And, perhaps most importantly for us, how is technology affected by its context? In particular, I want to look at how our decisions about how we treat knowledge can impact quite dramatically on the technologies we produce.	embedded system;information;knowledge representation and reasoning;ontology (information science);semantic web;shattered world;social network	Kieron O'Hara	2004	SIGIR Forum	10.1145/1041394.1041397	knowledge representation and reasoning;computer science;knowledge management;social issues;semantic web;social semantic web;data mining;management science;world wide web;social network	AI	-63.313263193302795	-28.588756532259197	112782

This paper presents the main findings of the PhD thesis entitled “Technologies of Non Linear Storytelling for the Management of Cultural Heritage in the Digital City: The Case of Thessaloniki”. This thesis focuses on the dedicated digital storytelling strategies that promote active audience engagement in urban cultural heritage. A collaborative model is proposed and analyzed (in multiple perspectives), aiming at providing an integrated approach to cultural heritage documentation, management and dissemination. The model has been built for the Digital City of Thessaloniki (in Greece), a big city, rich in Cultural Heritage, but with rather poor heritage management mechanisms. The research focuses on practices that promote Cultural Heritage in the Digital City and the prospects for improvement, examining theoretical and practical aspects of engaging people for the collection and interpretation of digital Cultural Heritage (places, artifacts, etc.). The outcome of this research is the development of a new model that fuels audience engagement and collaboration of cultural organizations. A pilot implementation strategy has been employed taking into consideration different perspectives of four different target groups that included art lovers, artists, representatives of cultural institutions and art journalists. A related survey was carefully designed and executed, seeking for formative qualitative and quantitative evaluation prior and after the development of the model. The proposed model brings forward novel technological and methodological guidelines regarding audience engagement, which could be successfully deployed in cities with similar cultural, geographical, and technological features.	smart city	Ofilia I.

This creates a need not only for information technology professionals in general but specifically for those individuals who also possess an expertise in the industry for which they will work (i.e. manufacturing, Education, medicine, the arts). Such an individual will understand the intricacies of their unique industry and how to apply information technology to enhance their organizations' processes. Unfortunately university students today have few options to obtain both knowledge sets with any substance in their studies. This gap creates a need for a minor in information technology and/or a minor within another field for those students already majoring in a computing field. This paper will focus on the first of these options, the minor in information technology and the efforts thus far by the authors' university to create one for its students.

ac207df1c0e833e434bf5c3f25a9d768774bc0e1	increasing middle school students' awareness and interest in manufacturing through digital game-based learning (dgbl)		Funding information European Community, Grant number: 609147 Abstract The change of the societal appeal of manufacturing among younger generations is a key element in order to address the talent shortage that is currently affecting the sector. In order to pursue this objective, the use of interactive learning environments such as digital games (DGs) can play an important role. Therefore, this paper presents the results of an exploratory study aimed at understanding the impact of digital gamebased learning (DGBL) on the awareness and interest of middle school students in manufacturing. In particular, the students had to deal with the management of EcoFactory, a simplified industrial plant where they had to take care of the main decisions that are typical in the modern manufacturing industry. The study was based on a pre-test–post-test quasi-experimental design conducted in a publicmiddle school in Northern Italy. The research triangulated the results of different methodologies, namely drawings analysis and questionnaires. The results showed a significant impact of the DG both on the awareness and interest of participants, especially in the environmental, social, and economic dimensions. Thus, the outcomes revealed the high potential that DGs have in explaining the complex concepts that are typical of manufacturing and in enhancing students’ proactivemotivation toward them. Finally, implications and suggestions for further research derived from these findings are discussed.	care-of address;design of experiments;discontinuous galerkin method;physical plant	Stefano Perini;Maria Margoudi;Manuel Fradinho Oliveira;Marco Taisch	2017	Comp.

Yet, a survey of two-year college catalogs reveals that the proliferation of information technology in automation has apparently failed to fully trigger such a paradigm shift. This may well be due to the misconception of familiarity with the technology, yet an analysis of IT issues in such a department-legacy equipment, sustainability issues, network and system policies-reveals that this may be the most dangerous aspect of the deficiencies. As IT instruction is prevalent and available at the community college level, the expansion of its influence and reach into traditional automation curricula is an immediate answer. A more forward looking possibility is the integration of the technicians themselves at the factory level.	automation;programming paradigm	Johnny L.

Insights from the discussion are applied to a particular case.  A project titled ‘Cultivating memory: investigating the intersection of public history, museology and community informatics in the Women on Farms Gathering (WoFG) heritage collection’ concerns a collection of iconic objects, texts, oral history recordings, videos, photographs and memorabilia relating to the lives of women on farms. The project explores how best this collection can be placed and extended both physically and virtually, in terms both of content and use.  The digital collection contributes to the establishment of a ‘knowledge commons’; a virtual space dedicated to the sharing of understanding, memories, and knowledge within the community.  Using this concept of the commons, this paper demonstrates how the digital collection enables the reclaiming of understanding, the construction and representation of knowledge, and the cultivation of memories within a community.

Loughborough University is now involved in three eLib projects, each investigating a different aspect of the digital library course. Project ACORN (Access to Course Readings over Networks) is investigating a digital equivalent of a short-term loan collection. The items in the collection are typically photocopies of articles on a course reading list that students can borrow for 24 hours. Even with such a short loan period, students in a large class may have difficulty accessing articles, whereas an online electronic version can be made available to the whole class simultaneously.

This analytical work provides a new theoretical lens that will be potentially useful to identify the relationships between social communities and information behavior. Specifically, I suggest an integrated sociological view on human information behavior primarily influenced by cognitive sociology and practice theory, which emphasizes the roles of socially constructed cognition of individuals.	cognition;cognitive science;information seeking behavior;information system;interaction	Eun Youp Rha	2018		10.1145/3176349.3176882	data mining;computer science;knowledge management;social constructionism;conceptual blending;information behavior;information seeking behavior;practice theory;cognition;sociology	HCI	-64.64100454113392	-33.169276905780556	113930

The environment leverages technologies designed for enterprises, which are suitable in terms of scalability, but do not perfectly address the specifics of MEC environment. Therefore, in this paper we focus on the application of Internet of Things (IoT) approach that would both improve education and streamline organization. From the variety of educational activities implemented in MEC, our area of focus is multi-party audiovisual collaboration during online classes. The scale and geographic scattering of participants makes this particular activity technically challenging and, at the same time, promising when considering application of IoT approach. In our opinion, extension of existing MEC infrastructure with IoT-compatible appliances could result in better organization of the collaboration and improve involvement of students in the educational process	adobe streamline;cloud computing;countermeasure (computer);internet of things;scalability;serial digital video out;social media	Lukasz Czekierda;Slawomir Zielinski;Marcin Szreter	2017	2017 IEEE 26th International Conference on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises (WETICE)	10.1109/WETICE.2017.57	computer science;knowledge management;distributed computing;scalability;cloud computing;internet of things;social media;information and communications technology	Visualization	-70.33346608878195	-29.24220701591907	115050

As computer science, digital arts, and other areas of study that use computer graphics continue to evolve and gain new substance, educators have come to master new content and achieve deeper understandings of computers and imagery. As the core field becomes more mature, educators in all computer graphics disciplines have a greater need for high-quality curricular resources. Offering excellent educational materials is an important service to the community of educators. Such support will empower both young and seasoned educators alike to benefit from and contribute to the work of others. In this way, we can achieve a higher standard of teaching worldwide.The purpose of our work is to provide tools to foster such a community of computer graphics educators. We will present a system that will act as the means for their work to be appraised, assessed and made available to others through an online server for refereed educational content in computer graphics.In this paper we describe the basis for and highlight some of the starting requirements of CGEMS, the online Computer Graphics Educational Materials Server.

624bf014154a2c8f7b3d262c0b83815ff379084d	introduction to the special issue: teaching healthcare operations research, part 1		Health care is the largest sector of the economy of all developed nations, comprising anywhere from about 9% of GDP in Western Europe to more than 17% of GDP in the United States. As operations researchers, health care presents an important area of study and application. Health care is a public good; its provision is important to society as a whole and to all of us as consumers. The promise of health care is health: the attainment of a longer and fuller life. However, the link between health and health care is, at times, tenuous. Moreover, health care is an expensive business that annually consumes ever more of society’s finite output. A common question amongst governments is whether the provision of health care is sustainable. In the Province of Nova Scotia health care consumes more than 45% of the provincial budget; moreover, health care spending appears to have no natural upper limit. How big a share of societal output can health care consume before other public goods (roads, schools, libraries) are squeezed out, resulting in a lower quality of life even though that life might be longer? Clearly, the provision of health care is important for society and, as operations researchers, an area deserving of much respect and attention. I know that health care is important and expensive and challenging, because I was taught this. I recall attending a health care policy class as a young doctoral student and listening to my brilliant professor describe the business of health care. I came to the class with a good technical background – lots of queuing theory, lots of linear programming, and lots of simulation – but I had little real knowledge of how health care functioned. Health care, I was taught, was a business, but a business like no other. This came as a revelation. I’d worked in the field long enough to know that it was difficult to apply models in health care, but I didn’t know why. What I learned is that while it is easy to formulate the constraints in a health care model, coming up with the objective function was often the challenge. This special issue on teaching health care operations research sits at the junction between OR theory and OR practice and the intersection between modelling and care. Good technical skills are of little value if researchers don’t understand why health care functions the way it does; system change is impossible, even for those immersed in the business, if a conceptual model of how the system functions has not been formulated. Teaching healthcare to operations researchers and operations research to health care professional is an important duty with broad implications for society and its members. In this issue, we see three papers that explore the interface between operation research, education, and health care. Two papers are classical case studies in which health care concepts and operations research models are integrated through an illustrative problem that must be resolved by students. The third paper applies OR methods to determine the optimal allocation of time and channels to the delivery of concepts in an MBA program aimed at working health care professionals. All three papers are excellent; they are engaging, clear and they tell a compelling story. In short, they make good reading. Bordoloi presents an eminently readable paper on the use of linear programming to optimize the delivery of OR course content in an MBA program aimed at physicians, nurse managers, hospital administrators, pharmaceutical managers and other professionals. The program involves both online and classroom delivery channels. Students—who are working professionals— have limited time in which to absorb complex operations research concepts. In his paper Bordoloi uses linear programming models to determine the amount of time and the delivery mechanism (classroom presentation, face-to-face games, online lecture, blogs, online	operations research	John Blake	2016	INFORMS Trans.

The study takes into account what it is like to be a university student in the digital age, in order to investigate how they find, evaluate and use information for their course work. The study is located within the qualitative paradigm (using a semi-structured task to obtain direct data from the student body). A number of needs and weaknesses are identified within the student group as regards their information behaviour. It is hoped that this study will serve as a basis for the design and subsequent implementation of Information Literacy programmes specific to this interdisciplinary field.	information literacy;programming paradigm;semiconductor industry;usability testing	Dora Sales;Maria Pinto;Andrés Fernández-Ramos	2018	JOLIS	10.1177/0961000616666131	interdisciplinarity;empirical research;translation studies;computer science;information literacy;knowledge management	HCI	-75.64756155815974	-35.71736704958595	115900

The range of roles taken on by artifacts and the attitudes students have toward them provide a basis for our discussion about how technology might be more effectively introduced into the socially negotiated environment of the introductory foreign-language classroom. We identify the need to balance between collaborative and personal technology in a stressful, but social, context.

Hiring, training, and supervising large numbers of student employees require endless amounts of time and energy. Despite these issues, customer service expectations remain high. Transitioning to unstaffed computing sites may prove to be the perfect solution.Several alternatives have been proposed, including eliminating the Consultant position all together. Our preferred alternative is to staff only the four main computing sites plus two residence hall sites with Consultants.Staffing only the four main computing sites plus two residence hall sites with Consultants will allow a reduction in work force without cutting the Consultant position completely. Work force reduction results in cost savings. Work force reduction will also create a more manageable group of employees, improving the quality of hiring, training, and supervising.Retained employees will be provided with extensive training opportunities, raising their skill and knowledge level to be more consistent with the high expectations of customers. Customers will have the option to visit the remaining staffed sites for immediate hands-on assistance. Customers visiting unstaffed sites may phone the Computing Sites Support Center for immediate phone assistance, and a Support Specialist can be dispatched to the site to provide hands-on assistance.	google sites;hands-on computing;knowledge level	Kristina A.

The usual approaches to plan classwork in the high school are organized around concepts, principles, tools. However, each concept, principle, or tool can be seen under diverse perspectives, in particular those held by mathematicians, scientists and engineers, with quite different implica- tions from a conceptual, methodological and epistemological point of view. Accordingly, the learning issues and the pedagogical means to ad- dress them are also different. Hence, it may be worth considering a com- plementary approach in order to shift the focus from the notions to learn to the (cognitive, methodological, creative) processes required from the students, the latter being tightly connected to the aforementioned gen- eral perspectives. The framework outlined in this paper is the basis of a core module as part of the renewed program offered by the University of Udine for the education of prospective teachers of informatics. This mod- ule addresses in an integrated way the nature of our discipline and the teaching of programming as a key activity to appreciate the distinctive features of each perspective. It aims at deepening the teachers' awareness about the variety of coexisting views and their pedagogical implications.	informatics;prospective search	Claudio Mirolo	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-09958-3_13	mathematics education;simulation;engineering;pedagogy	HCI	-74.22793022474383	-35.78073972430082	116943

Collaborations are both local where a local university collaborates with a local post secondary school institution (PSSI) or in transnational educational form. The Lisbon Recognition Convention Committee (2002) Code of Good Practice in the Provision of Transnational Education states that transnational Education is: all types of higher education study Programmes, or sets of courses of study, or educational services in which the learners are located in a country different from the one where the awarding institution is based. Such Programmes may belong to the educational system of a state different from the state in which it operates, or may operate independently of any national system. Currently, in Kenya Transnational education is by: 1. Franchising: Defined as the process whereby a higher education institution (“franchiser”) from a certain country authorizes another institution or organization (“franchisee”) from the same or from another country, to provide it’s (i.e. the franchisers) education services (e.g. the whole or part of one or more of its approved study Programme/qualifications. 2. Virtual Universities: Whose only contact with the student is by remote means (electronic or hard copy). 3. Programme Articulations (Twinning): Where two or more institutions agree to define jointly a study Programme in terms of study credits and credittransfers, so that students pursuing their studies in one institution have their credits recognized by the other, and accepted for transfer in order to continue their studies. 4. Off-Shore Institution Serving as an Examination Body: An autonomous institution which belongs, in terms of its organization and contents, to one particular national educational system, and offering its syllabi and examinations at accredited teaching institutions in Kenya. 5. International Institutions: Offering “international” qualifications that are not part of any specific educational system. Successful operations in TNE in Kenya, begin with the legalization of collaborative partnerships. The job of the Commission for Higher Education (CHE), Kenya is to oversee the quality assurance and expansion of university education, ensuring sustainability, affordability and relevance. The Commission for Higher Education (CHE) is mandated by the Government of Kenya to “ensure the maintenance of standards, quality and relevance in all aspects of university education and training.” (The Higher Education Institutions Handbook, 2012, p.8). Part of its core function is to plan for establishment and development of higher education and training. Establishment of TNE in the country must be approved and validated through the CHE. This is done through the process of accreditation. “Accreditation is the flagship of the Commission for Higher Education. The Commission accredits institutions and validates academic Programmes.” (The Higher Education Institutions Handbook, 2012, p.11). Legitimacy and status of an institution and a Programme of study is achieved through accreditation and validation (The Higher Education Institutions Handbook, 2012). The Universities Rules of 1989 facilitate the Commission for Higher Education (CHE) in the establishment and accreditation of private universities and the Programmes offered therein. The 2004 Rules further enable the CHE to validate diploma Programmes offered by Post Secondary School Institutions (PSSIs) for purposes of advancing the graduands of the same to enter into University education. In addition to this, the PSSIs upon meeting set minimum standards are able to offer degree Programmes through grant of authority for collaboration with accredited universities. With 1.7 million secondary school students in 2011 there is already heavy demand for university level education.

Wearable Computing, Fashionable Technology, and Smart Textile are being developed at the intersection of media, art, design, computer science, and engineering. However, in Germany, little research has been undertaken into Smart Textile in education1. Those activities are not realized at school in the context of artistic processes in general MINT2 education in classroom settings. In order to research the interplay of electronic textiles and wearable technology, hard and software tools, such as Arduino LilyPad, a programmable board designed for stitching into clothing and flexible applications are scrutinized. In the project, contemporary media art projects in the field of Fashionable Technology are explored to inspire interdisciplinary technology education. The project described in this paper engages girls in technology and engineering by integrating artistic processes as well as a more playcentric approach to technology and engineering education. themselves can be key to trigger interest and motivation to deal with technology embedded in everyday life. Artistic processes, diverse materials and media aim to mediate technology as aesthetic experience, embedded in artistic processes of shaping, designing, constructing, programming and presenting interactive technology in individual project contexts. The paper is based on the research project “Artistic Approaches to Engage Girls and Young Women in Technology and Engineering in Education at School and University” held at the KIT’s DOI: 10.4018/ijacdt.2011010102 International Journal of Art, Culture and Design Technologies, 1(1), 12-21, January-June 2011 13 Copyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Institute of Vocational and General Education.4 The research approach looks at coupling arts, sciences, and technology in engineering education. It explores a new approach to technology and engineering education at both school and university level integrating the artistic processes to the engineering curriculum and teaching culture. It discusses examples of more playful approaches towards ludic textile and wearable interfaces for interdisciplinary media-art-science and technology education based on shapable low cost media such as Arduino. Secondly, the project aims to facilitate transdisciplinary education scenarios, in order to integrate artistic processes and aesthetic experiences as a key to support learning in any subject, that is, especially in the subjects of science, technology and engineering. The projects aims to answer the question, why the support of an in depth interaction between arts, science and technology is important for future curricula and the rethinking of education.	arduino;computer engineering;computer science;e-textiles;embedded system;experience;human–computer interaction;interactive media;interactivity;ludic interface;mobile media;noise shaping;wearable computer;wearable technology	Daniela Reimann	2011	IJACDT	10.4018/ijacdt.2011010102	simulation;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-67.03166933536518	-36.937264430802685	117573

They have defined organizational learning as occurring when members have a shared vision and work together to achieve common goals in order to produce results that are important to them. In today’s technologically complex world, organizational learning offers a means of adaptation, survival, and long-term growth.

Inspired by collaborative action research approaches, this analytical approach aims to create a space in which the student can learn and co-construct meaning relative to the activity of collaborative design. It plays a role in enabling the learner/designer/observer to take a step back from their activities, both when considering the activity in isolation and in confronting it to others’ points of view. This article explains the steps and tools (methodological, theoretical and analytical) involved; it also provides feedback on experiences from 7 different contexts. It shows how the system as a whole enables analysis, interpretation, questioning, and critical and collective reflection of the situation.

ccb10626cc8237b866fda7ae135b460e2e9e8ea9	addressing self-disclosure in social media: an instructional awareness approach		Nowadays the information flowing across the different Social Network Sites (SNSs) like Facebook is highly diverse and rich in its content. It is precisely the diversity of the users' contributions to SNSs that makes these platforms attractive and interesting to engage with. Nevertheless, there is a high amount of private and sensitive information being disclosed permanently by these users in order to take full advantage of the services offered by such sites. Current privacy-protection approaches (like the one provided by Facebook) allow users to restrict the audience of their contributions and hide particular pieces of information; however, they are still far from being widely adopted and put proactively into practice. For this reason, we propose to analyze and address different aspects of online self-disclosure in Social Media from a pedagogical and self-adaptive perspective. In this work we introduce the architecture of an Instructional Awareness System (IAS) based on the MAPE-K blueprint for autonomic systems, and provide a definition of its feedback mechanism using principles of Constraint-Based Modeling (CBM).	autonomic computing;blueprint;control system;feedback;holism;information sensitivity;internet authentication service;privacy policy;recommender system;self-censorship;social media;social network	Nicolas Emilio Diaz Ferreyra;Johanna Schäwel;Maritta Heisel;Christian Meske	2016	2016 IEEE/ACS 13th International Conference of Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)	10.1109/AICCSA.2016.7945815	computer science;architecture;knowledge representation and reasoning;information sensitivity;self-disclosure;social media;social network;cognition;knowledge management;restrict	DB	-65.91120014379372	-30.250432424173088	117911

However, importance has not been placed on preparing teachers to use ICT in their instruction. This paper reports on a study conducted to explore the feasibility of ICT use in mathematics teaching at senior high school levels in Ghana. Interviews and survey data were used for data collection. Preliminary results showed that mathematics teachers in Ghana do not integrate ICT in their mathematics instruction. Among the major perceived barriers identified were: Lack of knowledge about ways to integrate ICT in lesson and Lack of training opportunities for ICT integration knowledge acquisition. To overcome some of these barriers, opportunities of a professional development arrangement for pre-service mathematics teachers were explored. Findings from the study revealed specific features of a professional development scenario that matters for ICT integration in mathematics teaching in the context of Ghana.	interviews;knowledge acquisition	Douglas D.

This includes negotiations, which are an important part of most organizations. Researchers are beginning to realize that the increased use of computer mediated communication in negotiations can change an individuals’ behavior, including their negotiation style and ability to detect deception. However, there is limited research in this area, so many originations are likely not aware of the problems associated with deception in computer mediated negotiations. This chapter reviews past research, a current study, and future research directions related to computer mediated negotiations and deception.	computer-mediated communication	Gabriel A.

The use of a developmental process that aims to meet established acceptance criteria for a project, and one which incorporates robust evaluation methodologies to validate approach and expenses is generally a key criterion for successful grant and tender applications in this emerging field. This paper outlines a methodology for quality assurance being delivered at Access OnLine. This methodology is based on a structured framework built on sound design principles, and which incorporates project management, performance against milestones, usabilit y and learning effectiveness adopting a ‘whole of project li fecycle’ approach to formative evaluation. Introduction Numerous factors have been leading to a rapid expansion in the adoption of technology-based educational and learning applications. These have included: the increasing sophistication of, and access to, internet, multimedia and interactive technologies; increasing pressures on educational budgets; and the need for increased flexibilit y in access to education due to time pressures and changing work and study patterns (Laurill ard, 1993; Carrucan et. al., 1998). Ensuring the success of educational applications that incorporate new technologies is however inherently a diff icult process. We can nevertheless identify certain factors that contribute to this success including assuring the quality of the process and the artifacts produced during the development process. In this paper we discuss a methodology that incorporates relevant quality assurance (QA) services that can maximise the likelihood of project success. In particular, our approach is based on a framework that provides suitable methodological structure, and a set of underpinning principles that are grounded in pedagogical and instructional design research and provide guidance in selection and customisation of specific quality assurance services. In the next section we shall consider educational applications and how technology has been used to improve accessibilit y and flexibilit y whilst achieving desired learning outcomes. We will l ook at the development of these applications and factors that influence the success of the development including quality assurance. We then move on to propose a quality assurance framework that allows us to address QA issues in a consistent and organised fashion. We provide a theoretical underpinning to this framework including principles that guide the creation of QA services within the framework. We then describe specific services within the context of our framework that can be used to carry out quality assurance of specific development projects. These services have formed the core of the successful QA approach carried out by Access OnLine. We finish with some observations on the limitations of the approach and the areas that require ongoing development.

35633dccbee3f601f62e3ec6ba3aba16cd9cf623	frameworks for mass collaboration, adaptable scripts, complex systems theory, and collaborative writing		In computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) and in the learning sciences, many of the terms used to conceptualize learning activities and actions originated from the concept of communities of practice put forward by Lave and Wenger (1991). While social practices are used as key constructs in many of the social sciences, the CSCL community works with specific operationalizations of those concepts that are useful for representing and analyzing the processes through which learning occurs. Concepts like communities of learners, communities of interest, knowledge communities (Stahl 2015), and knowledge building (Chen et al. 2015) should be seen as metaphors that serve as broad stances to be further specified and used as analytical lenses. As part of this specification, the unit of analysis and level of description must also be carefully considered as part of fashioning an analytical lens for a particular study (Ludvigsen and Arnseth 2017; Suthers et al. 2013). In this issue, new contributions to stances and concepts are presented. Intern. J. Comput.-Support. Collab.

561cf9dc0cb6e5688a2cd6fd37c467a8154cce05	towards the design of a virtual heritage experience based on the world-as-support interaction paradigm		We present the initial design stage of a Virtual Heritage experience for a bomb shelter built during the Spanish Civil War, namely Refugi 307. The shelter currently belongs to the History Museum of Barcelona which provides guided tours through the cultural heritage site for schools and the general public. The aim of the study was to define the requirements for the design of a first prototype based on the World-as-Support interaction paradigm. We conducted an ethnographic study and Participatory Design workshop to analyze different aspects of the requirements and to include multiple needs and viewpoints of the involved stakeholders. Based on the outcomes, we outline the potential for activities to foster (1) contextual-awareness between the learning content and the cultural heritage site, (2) environment-awareness in relation to missing objects in the physical space and (3) social-awareness to embody feelings related to solidarity and empathy.	programming paradigm;prototype;requirement;virtual heritage	Marie-Monique Schaper;Maria Santos;Laura Malinverni;Narcís Parés	2017		10.1145/3027063.3053089	human–computer interaction	HCI	-64.04694787362635	-37.15243918559766	119924

In this paper, we will describe a project to develop flash drive casings. The project scenario was structured as a request by a client to design a themed set of flash drive casings and a presentation case suitable for use as a gift to outstanding employees and high value clients. Each student rapid prototyped one flash drive casing of his or her own design. The project was implemented as a series of team and individual assignments spread over the semester, with the product of those assignments returned to the instructors in memo format. This project was implemented in three phases, over several semesters, with the number of students increasing at each stage to ensure that its full scale adoption was successful. The initial test of the curricular elements was made in two, approximately 20 student summer classes. At that time, several challenges were identified. Reflection on this phase revealed a need for additional written documentation containing “project hints” to help students provide designs that meet the rapid prototyper's production constraints. It was also determined that a number of intermediate assignments were needed to motivate students to remain on schedule for project completion. The project is currently nearing the end of development phase 2 and most design issues have been resolved. However, curriculum changes are warranted in response to student conceptual difficulties. As in many graphics design projects, a major challenge has been the development of three-dimensional spatial skills. Students have had difficulty creating designs containing layered structures, particularly those needed to secure the electronics within the casing. As expected in a first semester, first year course, some students have shown an inability to follow detailed instructions. While this weakness is normally only a grading issue, the flash drive covers are prototyped directly from their CAD files, making type of error particularly problematic. One major success of the project has been student excitement in the project and the improvement of their graphics skills from re-creation of existing designs to the development of novel designs.	computer-aided design;documentation;engineering design process;engineering drawing;full scale;graphics;rapid prototyping;usb flash drive	Paul D.

However, the discussion has focused mostly on what these trust marks are not doing in terms of helping patients (or other lay end users) find reliable medical information on the web. In this paper, we discuss how this focus on patients and their actions with respect to trust marks, has overshadowed, if not rendered invisible, what trust marks are doing to educate medical site/information providers. We draw on data from ethnographic research conducted at the Health on the Net Foundation in 2002 and 2003 in order to explore an alternate definition of what it means to be a 'user' of a trust mark and the importance of the review process in educating site providers. We argue that understanding the work involved in the process of assigning a seal is crucial to understanding the role that the seal plays as part of the medical internet.	educational process of instructing;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;event (computing);hyperlink;patients;world wide web	Samantha A.

However, the broader context in which engineers work and make their ethical decisions is often overlooked. In teaching engineering students, institutional climates help define how educational programs, curricula, and pedagogical modules are designed with some values and beliefs prioritized over others. The purpose of this research was to investigate if and how institutional climate shapes the ways in which students prioritize ethical values when making ethical decisions. In doing so, we conducted a mixed-method study across four project-based engineering design programs at four different universities. Our quantitative and qualitative results revealed that institutional climate shaped the ways in which students defined, prioritized, and solved ethical problems. Students' differences in ethical reasoning across institutions may reflect the different orientations of each of the programs, such as a focus on entrepreneurialism, marketable products, or human-centered projects. This paper concludes with recommendations for effectively teaching ethical reasoning skills in the context of project-based design teams. By reflecting on institutional climate, engineering educators have to ask themselves what values are highlighted explicitly while others are overlooked in teaching ethics to students. Administrators could explore opportunities for reforming institutional climate to broaden their students' notions about ongoing ethical dilemmas beyond the priorities and valued embedded in their particular programs.	autonomous robot;embedded system;engineering design process;experience;imperative programming;pedagogical agent;value (ethics);web design	Megan Kenny Feister;Qin Zhu;Carla B.

In order to perform holistic assessments and to improve web systems, a variety of strategies have been proposed to deal with this so-called human uncertainty. In this contribution we discuss the most relevant strategies to handle uncertain feedback and demonstrate that these approaches are more or less ineective to full their objectives. In doing so, we consider human uncertainty within a purely probabilistic framework and utilise hypothesis testing as well as a generalisation of the magic barrier to compare the eects of recently proposed algorithms. On this basis we recommend a novel strategy of acceptance which turns away from mere ltering and discuss potential benets for the community of the WWW.	algorithm;holism;personalization;www	Kevin Jasberg;Sergej Sizov	2018	CoRR		personalization;computer science;human–computer interaction;management science;statistical hypothesis testing;probabilistic logic;ranking;generalization;offset (computer science)	Web+IR	-66.95377209749945	-34.59791492563412	121838

474d6c458a34098b7972db91bdab535e4a4b7979	community-legitimated e-testing - a basis for a novel, self-organized and sustainable (e)learning culture?	self organization	Based on the assumption that educational standards can be operationally defined by pools of specific testing items properties of such item pools are discussed. The main suggestion of the paper is that pools of testing items defining a standard should be free accessible in internet, that they provide immediate feedback in form of scores and that certified results should be equivalent to results of classroom work. For the development of the item pools, web-2.0-type methods can be much more effective than closed expert groups and item evaluation by statistic methods.. Finally the consequences of such transparent community-legitimated standards for the future role of teachers and future forms of learning environments are discussed. 1 e-LEARNING AND e-TESTING THE PRESENT SITUATION Present attention of both teaching professionals and the general public towards e-learning and e-testing seems somewhat unbalanced: On google, about 200 times more hits are found for e-learning than for etesting. This may lead to the conclusion that there is much more interest into tools to support learning than into ways to test the success of learning and the actual topics that should be learned. Norms and standards in education are even harshly criticized as “teaching to the test” while autonomous “learning to the test” may be one of the most important “soft skills” in the future. The established way of learning in secondary education is still the classical teacher-in-classroom paradigm in which both the presentation of knowledge and the control of learning progress are done as a more or less not standardized “batch process” with a groop of 10 to 50 learners. Even if there is a well-thought syllabus behind this learning model, both learning and testing items and the respective assessment often seem arbitrary and planless to the learners – and there’s quite a bit of empirical evidence that this impression is not even wrong (European Commission, 2008). In many countries such as Germany, sucess in this kind of arbitrary learning and learning control environment has a great impact on the learners’ future development such as admission to university studies. The school system’s monopoly on this is almost complete and unchallenged – hardly an egalitarian and democratic access to educational opportunities. Recently, the school system’s absolute power in Germany was even increased by introducing a number of required classroom hours in secondary school for university access (EQF, 2008; KMK, 2006) – instead of introducing a catalog of required qualifications for university access. In other countries such as Finland, the US or Brasil, a common standard of competences for university access is either secured by central tests for graduation from secondary schools or by University entrance exams that my be run nationally (such as the SAT in the US) or by the individual universities. In such exams, competences are tested instead of the way the candidate has had to learn these competences. If the testing criteria are transparent, this approach offers much better chances for equal opportunities than the school-based model as 460 Nestle F. and Nestle N. (2009). COMMUNITY-LEGITIMATED e-TESTING A Basis for a Novel, Self-Organized and Sustainable (e)Learning Culture?. In Proceedings of the First International Conference on Computer Supported Education, pages 460-465 DOI: 10.5220/0002157204600465 Copyright c © SciTePress preparation for the exams may also be done by selforganized learning and does not completely depend on the success in a school system with arbitrary learning and testing processes. (The existence of such external exams nevertheless may even lead to the establishment of special schools that aim at a good preparation for the exams. As such schools tend to be costly private schools the failure of the public school system to prepare for the entrance exam may again lead to seriously unequal opportunities; this is for example the case in Brazil.) 2 THE SUCCESS OF NORMS AND STANDARDS IN INDUSTRY In the first half of the last century, norms and standards have been developed in many fields of industrial goods (e.g. 1917 the DIN norms in Germany, international norms: ISA since 1926 and 1947 ISO norms supported by the United Nations). In addition to basic engineering norms for material properties or threads of screws also more abstract issues such as the classification of books and other printed products (ISO 2108 covering the International Standard Book Numbering ISBN), layout of documents (ISO 2145 Numbering of divisions and subdivisions in written documents) and a multitude of other even more complex testing and certification problems are internationally standardized. The procedures for the creation of ISO norms consist of many different steps involving experts and committees to ensure norms and test methods based on sound expertise and with broad acceptance in the communities affected. Norms and standards improve or even enable intersubjective comparability of industrial goods. Like that, they also provide a basis for exchange of manufactured goods over large distances as customers can expect well-defined product quality and properties. This holds true both for simple goods as shoes as well as complicated manufacturing equipment. In both cases, standardization doesn’t mean uniformity: rather, the customer has a wide choice between different products and is not forced to accept a dedicated one-off. In the educational sector, generally accepted norms are still an exception. Examples are tests like TOEFL or SAT which are offered by ETS in the United States and even frequently used by universities outside the US in order to assess e.g. a candidate’s proficiency in English. In the absence of transparent standards learning progress and even more so learning results cannot really be objectively judged. Therefore, the learner is left with very limited possibilities to assess his or her learning progress. This, in turn, makes selforganized learning almost impossible. Nevertheless, self-organized learning is often more effective than school-based learning which is also often not very sustainable. A strong focus on exams obtained by school-based learning is therefore especially difficult for mature students and other learners with unconventional educational biographies who might find themselves shut-out from educational opportunities despite better qualifications than the graduates of the conventional school system. In countries like Germany where a poorly standardized school graduation exam is the main requirement for access to university education, universities often organize pre-term courses to catch up with elementary deficits from school education – regardless whether the required skills were not taught at all or not taught sustainably. For school graduates who go for vocational training instead of college education the regional Chambers of Commerce and Industry (IHK) organize entry exams which are not standardized even on the state level and where the test items are usually not made publicly transparent. Like this, there is the paradox situation that the skill levels of new employees are much less standardized than more or less everything else in industrial production. The development of community-legitimated sets of subject-specific transparent tests may offer a way out of this paradox situation and encourage self organized (life long) learning (EQF, 2008). 2.1 Definition of Educational Standards by Subject-specific Test Modules Almost all cognitive qualifications which are taught and learned on the secondary school level can be tested by appropriate test items. It even may be much more appropriate to define educational standards by means of classes of test items than by abstract verbal descriptions such as those presently used in Germany’s so-called national educational standards (KMK, 2003). Classical test psychology is based on tests which consist of items which are chosen from an item pool according to a statistical test model (e.g. the Rasch model). The validity of tests and test items is assessed on the basis of the test model.

2d36e68fe748bb486c22a7ba3a44c4ebd1a3e7a2	the old people using intelligent mobile equipment influence extent		Aging is inevitable; faced with the global aging population, how to make good use of cross-disciplinary technological integration for enhancing the care of the elderly in the physical, psychological and social environments becomes a very important issue. This is called the Gerontechnology. For the general public, “aging” often refers to the physiologically aging body parts. However, aging actually has psychological and social dimensions. From the analysis of the age groups, the proportion of the young population (0–14 years old) is decreasing year by year due to the declining birth rate. Currently, the young population only accounts for 13.45% of the total population. In Taiwan, the population over 65 years old accounts for 12.83% of the total population, making Taiwan approach the Aged Society, in which the elderly account for 14% of the total population. What is the Gerontechnology? Gerontechnology is actually a compound word that has been created to meet the needs of social development and is formed by combining Gerontology with Technology. Herman Bouma, a pioneer scholar in the Gerontechnology field, proposed to “understand technology and aging, and ensure the best technological environment so that we can support the elderly”. By definition, this is an application of technology that integrates different disciplines. It requires not only the participation of biomedical scholars and engineering scholars but also the involvement of scholars in social sciences, humanities, planning and design in order to create gerontechnological products characterized by both practical and industrial benefits. Currently, there are a number of operating service modes and a variety of home care application products on the market, such as the concept design of intelligent medicine cans, fall detectors, psychological comfort mechanical seals, indoor and outdoor universal lightweight electric vehicles. We should integrate this concept of technology into our daily lives, not allow technology to cause distress or fear, and enable technology to create comfort and security, thus generating the feeling of mutual trust. In addition, it can reduce the social cost of care for the elderly and shorten the time and distance between the elderly and their children, relatives and friends to enhance their interaction and emotional exchanges.

This mandate calls for a shift in the established library instruction paradigm at many institutions. Responsibility shifts from librarians teaching students how to locate materials for particular assignments, to faculty and librarians working together to embed the teaching and learning of information literacy skills systematically into syllabi and curricula. The new paradigm requires librarians and faculty to adapt a broader sense of the role of information literacy skills in higher education and in the preparation for the professional workforce. It also demands the learning of new methods and concepts by both teaching faculty and librarians, as they develop a collaborative approach to the integration of information literacy into general education and disciplinary education.	information literacy;librarian;programming paradigm;resultant	Gary B.

In the MIS core course, the goals of bringing knowledge to non-MIS majors that they will find relevant yet grounding that knowledge in the core of the IS discipline, which to a significant degree is inescapably technical, have to be reconciled. Non-MIS majors typically want to know only about the business implications of IS, yet the business aspects of IS cannot be so neatly separated from the technology dimension of IS. This paper describes a pilot offering of the MIS core course where business majors had to work with software technology at a hands-on level. A survey was administered to the students and the data analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance and logistic regression techniques to assess learning outcomes in both the business and technology dimensions of IS.	bridging (networking);gestalt psychology;hands-on computing;holism;logistic regression;management information system;programmer;relevance;web application	Suvankar Ghosh	2012				HCI	-76.75803158751923	-29.136476427226352	123030

This paper reports on our experiences designing and running workshops with (and for) teachers. Collectively, the aims of the workshops were geared ultimately at encouraging teachers to work with technologies in more `designerly' ways in the classroom, i.e. looking at technology as a working material, rather than as an off-the-shelf tool for certain activities, educational content or as an isolated part of the curriculum. We present a case study of one of the workshops, the Community Garden, designed in the format of a hackathon. We report on how teachers adopted the workshop concept, appropriated the technologies and, more interestingly, how six months later they appropriated the design process as a pedagogy to engage students in their learning.	cg (programming language);experience;experiment;hackathon;human–computer interaction;plug and play;workspace	Arafeh Karimi;Peter Worthy;Paul McInnes;Marie Bodén;Ben Matthews;Stephen Viller	2017		10.1145/3152771.3152787	curriculum;computer science;professional development;multimedia;appropriation;citizen journalism;engineering design process;participatory design;pedagogy;primary education;computational thinking	HCI	-67.75963498078637	-37.62558638737133	123174
58942224889f64d408700db3bae22fcaf13d9685	understanding how github supports curation repositories		In recent years, software developers have started to appropriate GitHub repositories to curate resources, in order to systematically select, evaluate, and organize existing artifacts for preservation and future use. Curation behaviors in social media sites, such as users’ experiences to curate tweets from Twitter and pins on Pinterest, are well documented. However, GitHub, as a social coding platform, presents a new context for this activity, raising questions about the nature of curation on this task-driven online work site. To explore and understand curation on GitHub, we compared and contrasted curation repositories with software repositories using activity logs and analyzed the content of popular curation repositories. Our results show that: (1) curation repositories have become a favorite category of repositories in GitHub; (2) curation repositories leverage collaborative features and practices native to GitHub in new ways; (3) curation repositories collect and preserve high-quality resources for the software developers’ community. Our results suggest that curation is becoming increasingly important to the software developers’ community, and current practices can be better supported with tools designed specifically for curation.	centralisation;digital curation;emergence;social media;software developer;software repository	Yu Wu;Jessica Kropczynski;Raquel Prates;John M.

The majority of recent activities in contextualised and ubiquitous learning focus on mobile scenarios, with location as the primary contextual dimension. However, the meaning of context aware learner support is not limited to location based solutions, as it is highlighted by the educational paradigms of situated learning and communities of practice. This paper analyses learner participation as a contextual dimension of adapting graphical indicators of interaction data for engaging and motivating learners in participating and contributing to an open community. The analysis is based on interaction data and interviews with participants in a nine week lasting design study, during which we compared the effect of two indicators on the engagement of the participants in the group activities. The trend of study results supports the presumption that the learners' perception of their activity visualisations is context dependent. We found that more engaging visualisation polarised the participants in this group: while contributing participants were attracted to contribute more to the community, non-contributing participants were distracted by the same visualisation.	activity recognition;embedded system;experience;graphical user interface;information management;information visualization;integrated project support environment;online community;scientific visualization;situated;social affordance	Christian Glahn;Marcus Specht;Rob Koper	2009	Educational Technology & Society		psychology;educational technology;social science;human–computer interaction;content analysis;computer science;knowledge management;evaluation;instructional design;multimedia;electronic publishing;law;world wide web;pedagogy	HCI	-65.96092721336763	-36.07203372687217	123319
6dc00cfe1f773935e595643fac9b0649b0bfb765	information research, practice, and education continue to invite and benefit from philosophy		It has become easy to make a case for the relevance, richness, and importance of philosophical thinking for information research and practice. The information professions regularly encounter previously unknown and unimagined relations between people and information, and information research very often touches upon the outer boundaries of science and the humanities. Both cases solicit philosophical thinking: the former frequently requires deep, critical thinking about what our relationship to information is and can be, with considerable consequences for the future of human kind and the planet, and the latter invites the same kind of thinking when our assumptions and views are shown to be insufficiently clear to allow confident conclusions and the generation of further knowledge. These domains also support philosophical thinking by providing new examples of philosophical concepts in action, inviting scholars to amend our views and definitions so that they match the information community’s perceptions of the world and gain further practical utility. A similar relationship exists between philosophy and information education. Newly-enrolled students in information science (IS) programs have the benefit of casting fresh eyes on the state of knowledge in various subfields in IS, and so quickly identify the limits of our understanding along various important topics. This often manifests when they begin asking difficult questions in the lecture hall; though the courses in such programs are mainly focused on skill mastery, many unaddressed societal, ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical issues lurk in the background, and students ask about, for example, the nature of information and its relationship to facts, knowledge, and propaganda; the digital divide and the right to information access; the implications of data collection, Web tracking, and the right to be forgotten. These are just a few common examples, each of which has been debated in scholarly literature, and the ties of information to philosophy extend into every subdomain of IS [1]. Such questions are difficult to answer – whether posed in class or in scholarly journals – in part because the concepts are complex, requiring wide and careful reading if one hopes to attempt an informed response. One could easily become lost in or intimidated by the wealth of such literature; looking only to Martens’s introductory	freedom of information laws by country;information access;information science;relevance;right to be forgotten;societal collapse	Jesse David Dinneen	2017	Education for Information	10.3233/EFI-170985	engineering ethics;medicine;knowledge management;pedagogy	Web+IR	-73.37492291111602	-29.773550615337797	123435

Design/methodology/approach – The article presents an examination of various subject access tools intended for retrieval of both print and digital materials to determine whether they exhibit features of faceted systems. Some attention is paid to use of the faceted approach as a means of structuring information on commercial web sites. The secondary and research literature is also surveyed for commentary on and evaluation of facet analysis as a basis for the building of vocabulary and conceptual tools. Findings – The study finds that faceted systems are now very common, with a major increase in their use over the last 15 years. Most LIS subject indexing tools (classifications, subject heading lists and thesauri) now demonstrate features of facet analysis to a greater or lesser degree. A faceted approach is frequently taken to the presentation of product information on commercial web sites, and there is an independent strand of theory and documentation related to this application. There is some significant research on semi-automatic indexing and retrieval (query expansion and query formulation) using facet analytical techniques.

In this chapter, we propose virtual worlds, or computer simulated 3D environments, as potential platforms that can be used to facilitate communities of practice. We differentiate virtual worlds from other Web based communication technologies, and discuss four unique affordances, namely self-expression, co-creation, co-experience and crowd sourcing, as enablers of attributes of communities of practice.

E-books must be designed to facilitate students’ learning effects. We designed two versions (high/low interactive) of the electronic picture book titled “Color Monster’s Adventure,” which has a fantasy storyline and appealing art design, and embedded basic concepts of chromatology and color psychology. The low interactive e-book version contains only simple interactive buttons with narration, and the high interactive e-book version features the following three advanced functions: guidance, prompt and feedback. We conducted an experiment in a northern Taiwan elementary school with a total of 40 fourth-grade students. The results showed that the students in the high interaction group performed significantly better in reading motivation, story comprehension and chromatics concepts than their low interaction counterparts. We concluded by proposing a high interactive e-book model and providing suggestions regarding integrating proper scaffolding into designing the e-book content to improve students’ reading performance. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The study has qualitative nature which 26 headmasters become part of the research process voluntarily. The self-reports were employed during the process and thematic analysis was done. Research findings are revealed that headmasters still keep working within the frame of traditional management approach however they reflected that approaching learning organisations is crucial in fostering professional learning. Approaching open leadership and management can be crucial in being learning organisation. In further studies, perceptions and experience of parents, teachers can be examined and experimental studies can be done in detail.	learning organization	Fahriye Altinay Aksal;Lutfiye Fedai;Zehra Altinay Gazi;Gökmen Dagli	2017		10.5220/0006384807320735	professional learning community;educational technology;knowledge management;shared leadership;experiential learning;political science;learning sciences;active learning;management;open learning;pedagogy	HCI	-74.84856593796911	-37.15893739081456	123854

f32886fa124e9ff7f1ccd868ccef7f5359a6dd25	the use of a new visual language as a supporting resource for people with intellectual disabilities		Our society is radically changing at an astonishing rate essentially, due to the fact that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are becoming an ever greater part of our lives. The frenetic rhythm at which the technology has evolved in recent years, has caused a significant separation between individuals who use communication technologies and those who don’t. There is a technological gap, and most of the time it’s because of the inadequacy both of the hardware and the software currently present for people with different levels of disability. This article discusses the use of a new visual language, known as VILA (VIsual LAnguage), to resolve the accessibility problems that people with certain types of disabilities have when they use ICTs to access to information and knowledge society and to communicate with other people under equal terms. We also present a first evaluation of a software prototype performed by a group of trainers specialized in children with Down syndrome to demonstrate their utility and the application fields of the language, as well as its advantages.	visual language	Francisco J.

Lifelong learning is becoming a necessity in many countries. It is more than just education and training beyond formal schooling. A lifelong learning framework encompasses learning throughout the life cycle, from early childhood to retirement, and in different learning environments, formal, non formal and informal. Opportunities for learning throughout one's lifetime are becoming increasingly critical for countries to be able to compete in the global knowledge economy. Lifelong learning is education for the knowledge economy. Within this lifelong learning framework, one needs to talk less about formal education structures—primary, secondary, higher, vocational, and so on—and much more about learning and learners' needs. It is essential to achieve a better integration of learning programs and articulation of the different structures. Learners should be able to come in and go out of the system at different points in time. The learning system needs to bring in a multitude of players, including the individual learner, the family, the employer, the provider, and the state. Governance in the lifelong learning framework is therefore more than just the ministries of education and training. Consideration of lifelong learning extends the World Bank's traditional approach to education, in which subsectors are looked at in isolation. Three years ago, when he articulated the Comprehensive Development Framework, World Bank President James Wolfensohn referred explicitly to lifelong learning as a component of what education means for poverty alleviation In 1995 Priorities and Strategies for Education emphasized the need to look at the education system in a more holistic manner. The 1999 Education Sector Strategy discussed the role of new technologies. The World Bank has just completed important new policy work on higher education reforms as well as a vision paper on the role of science and technology. The current report is the Bank's first attempt to lay out an analytical framework for understanding the challenges of developing a lifelong learning system. While the World Bank's involvement in lifelong education is still at the conceptual stage, two new projects—in Romania and Chile—have already been prepared to address the need for continuing education and lifelong learning. In the years to come we expect …		Paul Budra;Adrienne Burk;Thomas P.

Successful application of ICT for agricultural development however depends on the agricultural workersâ€™ knowledge of the information-driven technologies applications. Assessment of the Nigerian agricultural researchers and extension agentsâ€™ knowledge of the ICT applications showed that 92.9% of the researchers and 51.6% of the extension agents had knowledge of the ICT applications. The chi-square analytical test showed that the agricultural researchersâ€™ knowledge of ICT applications was significantly related to their level of education (x 2 = 52.33, p = 0.017), work experience (x 2 = 26.37, p = 0.04), IT training (x 2 = 26.19, p = 0.036) at p < 0.05 level. The extension agentsâ€™ knowledge of ICT utilities was significantly related to their education (x 2 = 47.39, p = 0.047) at p < 0.05 levels. T-test of difference between the researchers and extension agentsâ€™ knowledge of ICT applications was found significant. It was concluded that the respondentsâ€™ knowledge of the ICT applications was influenced by their level of education; and was recommended that the agricultural researchers and extension agents should train anytime the organisational ICT devices are scaled up for new applications in agriculture.

While it is certainly difficult to define CS, it seems still possible to grasp its scope through comprehensive points of view, addressing for example its foundations, technologies, and uses. This paper proposes a retrospective analysis of a 21-hour course trial realized in a French engineering school for six consecutive years; its aim was to help recent K12 graded students to have a more objective vision of CS. We start by discussing freshmen's CS dominant conceptions, and the role they think it plays for their future career. We then give some statistical elements concerning student perception of such a course; in particular, we analyze the obtained feedbacks and the limits of intended learning outcomes. In the light of this analysis, it is possible to state that, although initially reluctant to CS due to misconceptions, some students can develop interest and expectancy for this discipline as applied to engineering. A clarified vision of CS seems moreover to contribute to better adjusting choices of minors and majors and facilitate reasoned career plans. We finally conclude on some possible future issues in this subject for our society.	angular defect;digital native;ecology;feedback;interdependence;objective vision;persistence (computer science);relevance;separable polynomial;theoretical computer science	Siegfried Rouvrais;Ioannis Kanellos	2011	2011 Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2011.6142901	mathematics education;engineering education;applied mathematics;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;management;pedagogy;mechanical engineering	AI	-75.10317344552666	-32.34476313679936	124360

Quite often this involves a park staff member who is tasked with developing a concept and writing the text for publications, waysides, site bulletins or exhibits. This process will be most effective if the interpreter works with a professional media designer from the beginning of the project. Here is a suggested meanings­based strategy in which the interpreter works with a media designer to develop the concept and text of a media product: Meet with the designer to discuss goals/objectives for the project and ideas for an overall theme that uses universal concepts to establish the """" so what """" – the meaningful thread that will be used to tie all the parts of the product together; this should be linked to the purpose/significance statements for park resources that are identified in the park's CIP/LRIP. Decide on a preliminary topical division of the subject matter (panels or sections of the exhibit or series of waysides or sections of the webpage). Develop a sub­theme for each section that says something meaningful about the topic/subject, and supports the product's overall theme.

60bb60277d1fc452bbc3ff3add23c319dd1c2ce4	building a ubiquitous artifact that integrates problem-solving and learning processes to support creativity		This ongoing Ph.D. research work started with observations of shortcomings in the innovation and knowledge management processes in two companies, one Finnish and the other American. An extensive creativity and innovation literature survey was conducted. Problems were identified in three areas: idea evaluation (Amabile 1998), systematic idea development to the innovation phase (Drucker 1985), and community participation in individual idea suggestions (Hargadon 2003). A specific model, the technology brokering model (Hargadon and Sutton 1997) was chosen. From this starting point, a mobile prototype was built, evaluated, and gradually improved using a design science research framework (Hevner et al. 2004; Jarvinen 2004) and action research methods. The utility of the prototype is evaluated in three case organizations. This paper focuses on describing the mobile and ubiquitous computing related challenges in this prototype building process. Earlier work relates to the research of mobility, mobile architectures, user interfaces, and mobile learning (Ahonen et al. 2004; Syvanen et al. 2003), most recently in the global MOBIleam project.^ Within this research work, a mobile artifact is built to support learning, problem-solving, and creativity processes. According to Goodyear (2000), such an artifact and related tools should support individual construction of meaning and personal learnplace creation. From the perspective of the current research, the notion of leamplaces points, first, to ubiquitous computing environments and, second, to the informal learning area.

New Finnish Curriculum includes programming mentioned especially in accordance with mathematics and crafts. Consequently, Finland needs to train teachers to teach programming at elementary school level. In this paper, we describe how elementary math teachers were educated online to teach programming using the Racket programming language. The aim of the course was to increase both content knowledge (CK) and technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK). By analyzing the course feedback, questionnaires and exercise data, we present the teachers’ views on the course and effects on their professional development (TPD).

c483a91760b59060cb20bfac170b29432fe6c169	a preliminary evaluation of a participation-centered gameplay experience design model		In this paper we report on evaluation experiments from a Participation-Centered Gameplay Experience Design and operationalising instrument following a Design Science Research approach. The proposed model aims to contribute to an informed game design process by giving center stage to the notion of participation - the way players take part in the gameplay activity - from which a gameplay experience emerges and is interpreted by players. In order to achieve such an outcome, the model proposes six lenses for participation: Playfulness, Challenge, Embodiment, Sociability, Sensemaking and Sensoriality, to be able to rationalize and reflect on different forms of playing. To operationalise the model we present a design instrument consisting of a set of guiding questions, designed to elicit the main gameplay experience features, which strengthen each form of participation. We report on the evaluation of the model and instrument based on their introduction and use by 15 teams of game design students during their conceptualization phases, on 8 different project themes. We further present an analysis of students classification of the instruments, on understandability, productiveness and relevance, crossed with an analysis of the notebooks produced during the concept creation, to discuss and decide different ways to improve the model.

Debates in this area have typically focused on issues such as how to create a child-friendly programming language; or whether children can learn particular topics (e.g., recursion) in programming; or indeed, whether it is worthwhile for children to encounter programming at all. For the most part, these debates have taken place against an implicit background of assumptions about what children's programming looks like--namely, an activity focused on creating effects on a desktop screen or, occasionally, robotic toy. This paper argues that the cultural and anthropological contexts of children's programming are now poised to change: that new programming materials, physical settings, and unorthodox display surfaces are likely to shift the nature of the children's-programming debate in profound ways, and to make programming a far more informal, approachable, and natural activity than heretofore. We illustrate this argument with projects underway in our own research.	desktop computer;programming language;recursion;robot	Michael Eisenberg;Nwanua Elumeze;Michael MacFerrin;Leah Buechley	2009		10.1145/1551788.1551790	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia	HCI	-72.15665378126062	-31.26206301507212	125147

The increasing presence of online education has increased the availability of secondary and post-secondary world language courses in online and blended formats, yet a challenge associated with online language coursework lies in addressing the sociocultural aspect of learning a language. In this type of learning format, it is critical to consider Sociocultural Theory (SCT) concepts such as self-regulation, zone of proximal development (ZPD), and scaffolding. For instance, Zhang (2013) explores teacher-student collaboration in online courses; and Cappellini (2016) has researched scaffolding and the role students assume in the learner community when learning via telecollaboration.

d1338d871b072479c860711a7cabe408aab29c25	arizona literature mapper: an integrated approach to monitor and analyze global bioterrorism research literature	terrorism;usability;evaluation	Biomedical research is critical to biodefense, which is drawing increasing attention from governments globally as well as from various research communities. The U.S. government has been closely monitoring and regulating biomedical research activities, particularly those studying or involving bioterrorism agents or diseases. Effective surveillance requires comprehensive understanding of extant biomedical research and timely detection of new developments or emerging trends. The rapid knowledge expansion, technical breakthroughs, and spiraling collaboration networks demand greater support for literature search and sharing, which cannot be effectively supported by conventional literature search mechanisms or systems. In this study, we propose an integrated approach that integrates advanced techniques for content analysis, network analysis, and information visualization. We design and implement Arizona Literature Mapper, a Web-based portal that allows users to gain timely, comprehensive understanding of bioterrorism research, including leading scientists, research groups, institutions as well as insights about current mainstream interests or emerging trends. We conduct two user studies to evaluate Arizona Literature Mapper and include a well-known system for benchmarking purposes. According to our results, Arizona Literature Mapper is significantly more effective for supporting users' search of bioterrorism publications than PubMed. Users consider Arizona Literature Mapper more useful and easier to use than PubMed. Users are also more satisfied with Arizona Literature Mapper and show stronger intentions to use it in the future. Assessments of Arizona Literature Mapper's analysis functions are also positive, as our subjects consider them useful, easy to use, and satisfactory. Our results have important implications that are also discussed in the paper.	information visualization;mapper;pubmed;scientific literature;social network analysis	Yan Dang;Yulei Zhang;Hsinchun Chen;Paul Jen-Hwa Hu;Susan A.

The article is based on two hypotheses: 1) a general as well as a work-related sense of coherence can mobilize resistance to stressors and 2) a sense of coherence can occur through self-reflective narratives which clarify patterns of action for oneself and for others. Focusing on hearing impaired people in the Danish work force as well as primary school teachers, the authors create a stress tracking method based on HRV-measurements coupled with mobile questionnaires and reflective dialogues. Findings in the user-test indicated that the method is a tool that creates a story-based foundation on which it is possible to start a process of talking about own experiences, stress and stressors, strategies, contexts etc. when dealing with organizational stress.

To demonstrate how under addressed this topic is by the academy an experiment was made, and its results are portrayed. The novel contribution that this paper offers is the relation between relevant accessibility documentation to its appropriate type of user interface, which is intended to encourage the introduction of the topic of software accessibility implementation. Also, a proposal for a first slide, regarding accessibility implementation in software meant to be shown to software engineering students, who should produce accessible software in their future, is presented. As a conclusion, some insights are given and new possible research avenues are depicted.	assistive technology	João de Sousa e Silva;Ramiro Gonçalves;José Martins;António Pereira	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-56538-5_16	simulation;human–computer interaction;knowledge management	HCI	-62.93030630862481	-35.10984630600181	125710

The curriculum of this department conforms to typical computer science curricula of US engineering schools with a noticeable omission of comparable electrical engineering courses. When developing the course, I did my best to pay attention to learning preferences of the department’s student body. I also hoped to contribute to a degree to meeting labor market demands for developers of electrical engineering CAD software. As for inspiration, I was enchanted with ideas of the Mead & Conway revolution, albeit indirectly related to my enterprise.	computer science;computer-aided design;conway's game of life;electrical engineering;mead & conway revolution	Vladimir Vasilich Tregub	2011	CoRR		engineering management;social science;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;sociology;management;information technology	DB	-75.25315568557377	-30.518175895080148	125726

Till present there aren’t any tests of students’ knowledge on a nation-wide level. Therefore nation-wide or international contests currently offer the only opportunities to compare the knowledge of the participating students on a large scale level. By evaluating the overall performance of the students of different federal states, we were able to compare the effectiveness of different approaches of teaching Informatics at secondary schools.	computer science;gesellschaft für informatik;informatics	Christoph Steer;Peter Hubwieser	2010	Informatics in Education		knowledge level;knowledge management;informatics;computer science;information and communications technology;pedagogy;information science	HCI	-73.77889083876497	-33.9823067926413	125853

New types of research outputs, modes of scientific communication and new circulation mechanisms, as well as enhanced opportunities for scientific re-use and measuring research impact, in combination with new approaches to research assessment and evaluation are all having profound effects on the social system of science. To be sure that these innovations will not break the social sustainability of the science community, it will be valuable to develop a model of science as a tool for computer simulation of social consequences from possible innovations within virtual research environment. Focusing on possible social problems related to these new virtual research environments this short paper provides a brief analysis of the current situation in science (challenges, problems, main actors), general views on model of science (landscape, main agents, important properties, etc.) and on areas where simulation can contribute to better understanding of possible futures for the scientific community.

As numbers of OER available freely keep on growing, many LORs struggle to find sustainable business models and get the users’ attention. Previous studies have shown that Quality assurance of the LORs is a significant factor when predicting the success of the repository. Within the study, we analysed technology enhanced learning literature systematically regarding LORs’ quality approaches and specific collaborative instruments. This paper’s theoretical contribution is a comprehensive framework of LOR quality approaches (LORQAF) that demonstrates the wide spectrum of possible approaches taken and classifies them. The purpose of this study is to assist LOR developers in designing sustainable quality assurance approaches utilizing full the potential of collaborative quality assurance tools.		Kati I.

959652d92d175a5eb3f9c8a9370ec437bf3c9e01	introduction to addressing grand challenges with information technology minitrack		The Addressing Grand Challenges with Information Technology minitrack provides a forum for the discussion of the world’s most important or challenging problems, and the roles that information systems and information technologies can play in resolving those problems. The minitrack debuted just one year ago at HICSS-49, and was founded in response to common perceptions that a great deal of contemporary IS/IT research focuses on relatively esoteric or obscure topics that are of little practical value to society. In contrast to papers that focus on a narrow problem domain, this minitrack is designed to encourage researchers to think about big, important issues, the resolution of which would be widely beneficial to mankind. Innovative, ambitious, or unusual solutions to humanity’s greatest problems are particularly welcome in the Addressing Grand Challenges with Information Technology minitrack. For HICSS-50, the Grand Challenges minitrack is pleased to host the presentation of two papers that conform to the minitrack’s foundational principles. First among these is a paper entitled “Forming a Dimension of Digital Human Rights: Research Agenda for the Right to be Forgotten”, which addresses many interesting facets relating to the right to be forgotten, including discussions of this right from the perspectives of information privacy, technology, society/culture, and law/policy. The second paper in the minitrack for HICSS-50 is entitled “Financial Decision Support System for Wind Energy – Analysis of Mexican Projects and a Support Scheme Concept”, which describes a useful application of methods and technology within the specific context of wind-based energy generation. Both of these papers provide valuable and incremental insights into interesting and important problems, and should yield a lively and engaging discussion at the conference.	decision support system;grand challenges;information privacy;information system;lively kernel;problem domain;right to be forgotten	Daniel Soper	2017			computer science;data science;software engineering	HPC	-71.23156923466634	-26.844837838242064	126464

We believe that in addition to producing useful recommendations, certain insights from media research such as simplification and opinion diversity in recommendations should form the foundations of such recommender systems, so that the behavior of the systems can be understood more closely, and modified if necessary. We propose and evaluate such a system based on a Bayesian user-model. We use the underlying social network of blog authors and readers to model the preference features for individual users.

The curricula and teaching at ALA-accredited library schools revolve around aspects of librarianship such as providing research assistance at a reference desk, collection development, and cataloging; but they do not address preparing the recipients of the MLS for the demands of faculty status at a college or university library. Thus, while academic librarians may be well prepared to assume professional duties in an academic setting, they may be less well prepared to perform activities such as research and publication that are required of faculty members seeking tenure and promotion.	librarian;ritz dakota digital	Paul Alan Wyss	2010	C&RL	10.5860/crl-53r1	curriculum;corporate governance;library science;social science;mathematics;management;statistics;pedagogy	Web+IR	-77.20075594234257	-31.657903816860294	126563

Recently, social media and networking sites have become increasingly popular as learning and teaching resources in higher education, providing students with increased opportunities for educational engagement. Whilst research has examined the effects of including social media in class and whether it assists students in academic engagement, it remains to be seen whether social media is understood to affect student attitudes towards their learning experiences. Subsequently, this research endeavours to understand student perspectives on the inclusion of social media in higher education and seeks to establish whether the inclusion of social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, can impact on student motivation and goal orientation. Whilst research in this area is increasing, this paper provides valuable insight into student perspectives on the inclusion of social media in higher education, whether they believe motivation and goals to have been affected by it, and the broader reaching consequences of its inclusions with regard to departmental interaction.	experience;social media;while	Samantha Cooke	2015	Education and Information Technologies	10.1007/s10639-015-9444-y	psychology;social science;multimedia;social psychology;pedagogy	HCI	-74.65480694583115	-36.252120127298795	126685

From existing literature, we know some of the barriers in promoting STEM careers among people in low SES groups include a lack of role models, understanding or misconceptions of STEM careers, and knowing about STEM career opportunities. The purpose of our research is to explore the potential influence of socializers on students as they make career choice decisions (primarily in science and engineering) from student's and educator's perspectives. We focused on students from Appalachia because they typically come from lower SES, are often first generation college (FGC) students, and are underrepresented in STEM fields, making their college and career choices particularly important to understand. We framed our research in Eccles' Expectancy Value Theory using data from an on-line informational questionnaire with educational stakeholders and in-person interviews with high school students from rural central Appalachia. Consistent with EVT, our findings reveal that students consider their parents and their educators as valuable socializers. Educators, however, value outreach activities provided by professionals to help students explore engineering career choices. This is consistent with a reported lack of confidence in ability to talk with students regarding engineering careers. By comparing the perspectives of students and educators, we begin to address the potential gaps of “who's doing what” with respect to assisting students as they navigate career choice decision making in high school.	accessible surface area;extreme value theory;online and offline;scsi enclosure services;socialization	Cheryl Carrico;Homero Murzi;Holly Matusovich	2016	2016 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2016.7757722	knowledge management;political science;nursing;pedagogy	HCI	-76.02269087839795	-33.466193419441694	126908

However, Bereiter is critical of the model because it does not address whether understanding is deepened in the process of socialization, externalization, combination and internalization. To address this issue of understanding, this paper proposed a framework that synthesizes the basic phases of problem-based learning with Nonaka’s model. This paper reports on a study investigating if a course designed based on this authentic framework can help to stimulate knowledge creation based on deepening understanding. Several types of data were collected in this design-based research, namely: reflections by the participants and instructor; group discussions; student-created artifacts; and documents, records and artifacts that reflect the overall design of the course. The findings suggest that the participants demonstrated advancing understanding amidst knowledge creating conditions and processes consistent with Nonaka’s model. Other key implications are also discussed.		Meng Yew Tee;Shuh Shing Lee	2013	I. J.

From a learning perspective, however, it is difficult to access meaningful on-site information within a given context. The Hypercontextualized Game (HCG) design model interweaves on-site resources, translated as content, and the digital game. As a local game design process, HCG builds on the resources available on-site (context) and transfers them beyond their origin (hyper). A successful example is the HCG stories in LieksaMyst, an application developed for the Pielinen Museum, in which the player is guided through a series of activities by a virtual host from the historic past. It took three years of extensive work and research for the LieksaMyst HCG stories to mature from brainstorming concepts to a fully-fledged museum service. Curators, educational technology experts and a total of 476 visitors (from 6 to 77 years old) contributed to the design process. The analysis of the context and feedback from the visitors enabled us to choose media, content and activities suitable to the Pielinen Museum. Our findings indicate that quality time, sincere reflection and communication between local experts and potential players, are indispensable when designing a HCG based game. The analysis benefits researchers and practitioners who are interested in the ways in which a game can bridge the gap between people and relevant on-site information.	feedback;online and offline;virtual hosting	Carolina Islas Sedano;Erkki Sutinen;Mikko Vinni;Teemu Henrikki Laine	2012	Educational Technology & Society		psychology;game design;educational technology;social science;simulation;context effect;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;instructional design;mobile device;game developer;multimedia;management;world wide web;pedagogy;outdoor education	HCI	-69.19990032778935	-37.49658469985871	127899

Through this interactive page, teachers can conduct supervised teaching, and students will have the tools necessary for guiding their learning process, according to their capacities and possibilities. However, the material is designed to serve as a complement to the traditional method of attended teaching.

They are often single unit focused, paying most attention to individual assessment items thus not developing a holistic view of their course. This paper presents a theoretical framework to support staff and students to recognise, scaffold and achieve learning outcomes and academic skills at unit level and to recognise how these contribute to course and graduate learning outcomes, within the boundaries of Australian university and professional accreditation requirements. A case study is described that demonstrates the manual implementation of the framework. The complex nature of the implementation suggests that a software solution is required to ease the process and ensure the resulting mapping will have some longevity by being maintainable.	holism;requirement	Robert Dew;Andrzej M.

e793c41a0d926b6828b076932c5e4d6fb6b7889f	analysis of active learning suitability of subjects in information and electronics for computing education		“Active Learning (AL),” the teaching method which puts more emphasis on students' active participation in class and their abilities to discover problems and solve them, has been coming under the spotlight worldwide. We are promoting AL in the field of information and electronics. Especially, we are practicing A3 Learning System specializing in utilizing computers. We have aggressively introduced AL in class and seen the good effects of them. However, some problems are emerging in a certain type of subjects, which may mean that there are subjects unsuitable for AL. In this paper we report large-scale analysis of introduction of AL in information and electronics field and suggest that successful introduction of AL in class depends on the type of subjects.	computer;dbpedia;one-way function;teaching method	Yoshikatsu Kubota;Akiko Takahashi;Yoshihiro Hayakawa;Yasuhiro Kashiwaba;Kuniaki Yajima	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment, and Learning for Engineering (TALE)		simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence	Robotics	-75.50011084497454	-35.68609685580537	129723

The types of assistive technology in this study included assistive devices and educational services. Data were collected from a questionnaire developed as a rating scale checklist that was completed by 140 undergraduate students with disabilities. Results of this study found that all types of educational services provided more to undergraduate students with disabilities than almost all kinds of assistive technology. Additionally, the students utilized assistive devices and accessed educational services for different reasons, and most students with visual disabilities were given either assistive devices or educational services. In terms of use, results found that students with hearing disabilities used assistive technology the most, whereas findings concerning needs showed that all of the students with disabilities demanded almost all types of assistive technology.	assistive technology;freedom of information laws by country;rating scale;terms of service	Theeratorn Lersilp	2016	Information	10.3390/info7040054	knowledge management;multimedia;higher education	HCI	-75.37839650220172	-32.78362824827374	129790

It is the human communicative ability to display understanding to resolve misunderstandings that plays an important part in the organization of the design inputs to a construction project. Ambiguity and uncertainty, as different forms of misunderstanding, are studied in this article, as they are manifest in the conversation at a design meeting. In this setting the coordination of both in situ design activities and the planning of design tasks takes place in real time, in conversation. Exhibited are several ways that design ambiguities and uncertainties can be seen in the interactional details of a multidisciplinary design team’s conversation, to then report on how different design expertise featured in the raising of, and attempts at resolving, the misunderstandings that arose. In the course of this meeting, ambiguity and uncertainty were observed not as neat, discrete phenomena but were interwoven in the conversation. This characteristic poses difficulties in the disambiguation of the problem-solving response to each form of misunderstanding and further develops our understanding of design as it is communicated and conducted in social interaction. Finally, some implications from this study are put forward to inform the design of support for collab-	problem solving;word-sense disambiguation	Rachael Luck	2013	AI EDAM	10.1017/S089006041300005X	uncertainty;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence	HCI	-63.88357364505177	-33.38544853636361	129957

The paper suggests a framework for the design of computer assisted learning activities — e-ducation. The framework captures three contemporary interrelated aspects of teaching and learning and is more pedagogical than it is analytical. The three aspects covered in the e-ducation framework are electronic, engaged and empowered. An implementation of the framework is used to illustrate how e-ducation can be applied in educational research and practice. The paper concludes that the e-ducation framework contributes to both educational research and educational practice. Keywords: Assessment; Change; Collaboration; Constructivist; Experiential; Problem solving; Research paradigm; Undergraduate Introduction The modern educational system was developed to teach the skills necessary and the facts applicable to survive in the industrial society; facts that would be true and skills that would be useful throughout life. The factory was the model of choice; all students learned the same way and should learn the same things; all should be at the same place at the same time; and facts were transmitted to the students and later measured through instruments like written exams. But things have changed: ‘Schools today are structured more for the industrial age . . . problem is, those factory jobs don’t exist anymore’ (Soloway, 1993, p. 28). While the most important objective of schools and education used to be the teaching of facts and skills, today there is an intention among many educators to put as much emphasis on the actual process of acquiring the knowledge as on the know-ledge itself. Education needs to help students develop conceptual tools to become self-directed learners capable of learning new things and adopt to an increasingly dynamic, and also complex, work situation. Education has changed from teaching to learning with a change of roles and responsibilities in the learning process. Additionally, there is another element which is changing education — computers. Computers or rather information technology (IT) have become a routine component of many aspects of education. But for the computer to bring about a real and substantial change, its introduction must be accompanied by improvements in the understanding of learning and teaching. Today the culture of the educational system is challenged. IT has the power of		Urban Nuldén	2001	J. Comp.

On the one hand, most of us work very hard just to do a good job at what we already know how to do. At a teaching institution such as mine, most faculty teach 4 classes every semester. We all have additional responsibilities in academic advising and administration. How much time is left to learn new techniques and languages? At research universities, the pressures are different but certainly no less. How many faculty will choose to take time away from publishable and fundable research to learn new techniques to bring into the undergraduate classroom? Faced with these pressures, it makes good sense to stand by the known, the essential, the tried and true.	computer science	A.

However, this process is often presented linearly: reading comes first, writing comes second. This neglects the creative capacities of the child until he is fully capable of reading. This paper presents RoyoBlocks, a project that explores literacy learning through a set of tangible wooden word blocks and a plush reading companion. By incorporating wireless technology with traditional childhood toys, RoyoBlocks provide pre-literate leaners an opportunity to practice and hone both their reading and writing skills. In this paper, we discuss the learning processes that informed our design and the subsequent design decisions we made while developing RoyoBlocks.	toys	Jonathan Kleiman;Michael Pope	2013		10.1145/2485760.2485861	engineering;multimedia;communication;pedagogy	HCI	-68.08102430540764	-37.10199660738703	130733

In this work, we report on our experience of teaching Ubiquitous Systems to ICT students. We argue that a course on Ubiquitous Systems provides an excellent learning context for introducing ICT students to this broader view of ICT innovation, allowing them to explore the valuable and systemic use of information technology in the real-world. Our study addresses 4 main themes that recurrently emerge as fundamental issues in the course design, more specifically: technical scope, selection of project topics, multidisciplinary work, and project organization. We gathered quantitative and qualitative data over 3 editions of this course to characterise the key design challenges associated with each of these challenges. The result is a structured set of insights that may inform others in the design of similar courses, providing a framework to reason about the key design decisions and their effect on the ability to promote advanced competences for ICT students.

In the first section, I will analyze why philosophy of technology and engineering ethics have taken separate paths so far. The following section will deal with the so-called macro-approach in engineering ethics. While appreciating the initiative, I will argue that there are still certain aspects in this approach that can be improved. In the third, fourth, and fifth sections, I will point out three shortcomings of engineering ethics in terms of its macro-level discourse and argue that a number of certain insights taken from the study of philosophy of technology could be employed in overcoming those problems. In the concluding section, a final recommendation is made that topics of philosophy of technology be included in the curriculum of engineering ethics.

However, the limitations of VLEs have led to the development of a new generation of VLE - the Personal Learning Environment (PLE). PLEs avoid these limitations and have new features that allow students to control and develop new applications, such as Web 2.0 applications and social networks. Whilst PLEs have resolved some of the drawbacks of VLEs, it is argued that PLEs also have greater potential to cover a wider range of aspects. This paper presents a proactive context-aware architecture for PLE supporting two major objectives: lifelong access and learner-centric study, covering both traditional formal (institution-based) and informal (private, non-institution-based) academic learning.	social network;web 2.0;while	Mafawez T.

Implications of these findings for the philosophy and design of instruction may be momentous. Here, we build on design-based research efforts centered on exploring the potential of embodied interaction (EI) for mathematics learning. We sketch two emerging, reciprocal contributions: (1) a sociocognitive view on the role of automated feedback in building the perceptuomotor schemes that undergird conceptual development; and (2) a heuristic EI design framework. We ground these ideas in vignettes of children engaging an EI design for proportion. Increasing ubiquity and access to mobile devices geared to avail of EI principles suggests the feasibility of mass-disseminating materials evolving from this line of research.	binary prefix;cognition;heuristic;interaction design;mobile device;problem solving;theory	Dor Abrahamson;Dragan Trninic	2011		10.1145/1999030.1999031	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence	HCI	-67.56464758125217	-37.03682668330064	131486

Through our analysis, we make several contributions. First, we provide a general overview of the structure and common framings within research on makers. We discuss how these statements reconfigure themes of empowerment and progress that have been central to HCI rhetoric since the field's inception. In the latter part of the article, we discuss the consequences of these shifts for contemporary research problems. In particular, we explore the problem of designed obsolescence, a core issue for Sustainable Interaction Design (SID) research. We show how the framing of the maker, as an empowered subject, presents certain opportunities and limitations for this research discourse. Finally, we offer alternative framings of empowerment that can expand maker discourse and its use in contemporary research problems such as SID.	framing (world wide web);human–computer interaction;interaction design	David Roedl;Shaowen Bardzell;Jeffrey Bardzell	2015	ACM Trans.

In studying the electronic mail exchanges of organizational members during one year, we found that they engaged in a range of threading activity to establish and maintain continuity, coherence, and coordination in their collaborative work over time. In particular, we found that organizational members relied on simple threads to focus their attention and action on a particular topic over a short period of time, concurrent threads to enable their participation in multiple topics at the same time, and compound threads to allow provisional settlement of key issues that were subsequently revisited over extended periods of time. We conclude by discussing the implications of conversational threads for research and practice of virtual organizing.	email;organizing (structure);scott continuity;thread (computing);virtual organization (grid computing)	JoAnne Yates;Wanda J.

The framework was designed based on the basic principles of Activity Theory, which however have been adapted and adjusted to the project's objectives. Hence, it includes a map of actors and other parameters functioning in a person surrounding """"ecosystem"""", and it allows us to understand and map roles, expectations, barriers, as well as to devise solutions to tackle digital divide. Taking as a starting and central point the person and his/her wish to self-determination and fulfilment (quality of life) and the related needs, it provides a map of how the various concepts and variables interact within the theoretical and methodological perspective of the collection, description and assessment of experiences in ICT-AT education and competences development of persons with disabilities (PwD) of all ages. The conceptual framework represents two interacting learning activity systems: (a) the internal system of the end-user, which includes the end-user and his/her needs, the setting where learning takes place and the other actors involved, and (b) the external system, which embraces the internal system but also wider issues of policy and practice and experiences and 'actors' that contribute to the development and use of ICT and ICT-AT skills in all areas of life.

However, when considering this development it becomes essential to take into account the potential characteristics that students must have to be successful in this kind of education. This study is based on this human aspect. Thus, the authors have focused on learners and the fundamental qualities that they must have to study English via a hypermedia modular model and get their goals. Based on the results of this research the authors can indicate that characteristics like reasonable computer skills, ability to work both individually and in groups, capability of being organized and tenacious in their learning, a high level of academic maturity and a reasonable competence in English that allows them to be autonomous in their learning are essential features to be successful in this type of education.

Knowledge in the circulation databases can be explored in-depth to relevantly reflect this need. In this paper, a data mining based model (DMBA) is designed and developed to help allocate the library material acquisition budget by opening up the utilization of library materials that users have made use. The developed model is based on the feature of ID3 algorithm to explore explanatory knowledge via information theory and statistics to derive appropriateness via utilization gain. The main output of the DMBA is the weights as the basis of library material acquisition budget allocation for departments via the combination of explored explanatory knowledge and appropriateness. The developed DMBA was supported by a practical application case. q 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Most applications are leaving batch operations for time sharing ease of use.In fact, all kinds of computer work could be performed through a console: development, maintenance, data base query and update and even batch control and submit.A second problem arises as end-user profil is no more computer oriented. Users only look at the time the system needs to answer their requests, and don't care about the computer game. So performance analysts and operations managers are supposed to achieve a certain level of servic which they are almost unable to measure.We try in this paper to discuss some major problems related to conversational computer operations.

9c3f9f245d7e4b71390b07662b9c4a4c32e60293	greetings from the guest editor	guest editor	Welcome to the inaugural issue of the Journal of Educational Resources in Computing (JERiC). I am pleased to be able to serve as guest editor of this the first electronic journal in the area of educational resources for computer science and computing studies. The journal’s editors will provide you with background on the development of this journal, so I would like to tell you a bit about the creation of this issue. Papers for this issue were submitted based on the work done at the June 2000 Dagstuhl conference on multimedia. This small, working conference provided an opportunity for educators and researchers to present, critique, and brainstorm about new methodologies, applications, and techniques, and to include multimedia structures to enhance the education of future computer scientists. At the end of the conference, attendees were invited to submit papers or demonstrations of their work for inclusion in JERIC. The papers were submitted electronically and then sent for review to at least three well-known referees in the fields of computers, education, and multimedia. An international set of reviewers and authors bring a wide perspective on research and classroom practice to the journal, and the papers span a wide range of topics, providing innovative and sharable applications for education in computer science. Metamodels, metadata, and frameworks are a theme for some of the articles. In a paper on an open learning environment, the authors describe a national joint project in Germany for vocational education in technology. The authors outline an approach to satisfy the requirements for metamodeling learning resources and services. Relying on metadata, one author describes the use of an application, Multibook, to create exercises and, by extension, to create course sequences in general. Another article provides a taxonomy for multimedia, and linkages from that taxonomy to both design and evaluation of multimedia activities appropriate to a course on interactive multimedia. The article includes an example of student work using the taxonomy. The tools necessary for sharing resources is another theme for some of the articles in the issue. In a general overview article, a three-tier model for sharing materials is outlined and the implementation described. The architecture is open and available.The tools that permit Java-applets to be shared in real time and enable an educator to manage a dynamic telelearning session are described in yet another article. The final general area is one where specific applications, applets, or tools can be used directly or with slight modifications. One such paper links to simulations and applets for understanding distributed systems. By modifying a specification and observing the results, students can design their own learning processes.	applet;brainstorm;computer science;computer scientist;distributed computing;java;metamodeling;multibook;multitier architecture;requirement;simulation;yet another	Rachelle S.

Details of over 120 kiosks and nearly 47,000 user sessions and 310,000 page views were used for the comparison. The kiosks are proving popular, although some use appears to be of a cursory and seemingly unproductive kind. Surprisingly significant differences between kiosk locations were found. This early research reported here is part of an ongoing study of how users obtain health information by interacting with different digital platforms: kiosks, the Internet, and digital television. Comparisons are made between the results of this study and a similar study conducted by the authors on commercial health kiosks, those of InTouch With Health.	touchscreen	David Nicholas;Paul Huntington;Peter Williams	2002	Aslib Proceedings	10.1108/00012530210452573	digital television;telecommunications;computer science;health;advertising;location;tactile sensor;technology	HCI	-74.07156196369105	-24.996189254650922	132756

On this basis, this paper built a new set of network database usability evaluation factors, and suggested that we should make an usability evaluation from the following aspects like database effectiveness, efficiency, system performance, 4 level indicators of users' satisfaction and 24 secondary indicators so that the evaluation can be well-targeted and highly practical. Finally, this paper took the case of WANGFA as an example to make an application exploration. Network database is mainly engaged in academic research for researchers. WANGFAN, CNKI, VIP and the National Library & Documentation Centre are top 4 datebases in China that continuously shared by people. Continues to digital and network resource sharing, improving the efficiency of users of digital resources is the main goal of excellent network database. However, in the construction of the database, if simply to pursue advanced automation technology, not care about the user's needs, convenience, efficiency and other point of usability view, it will not improve the customer satisfaction index and not reach the expect result of the system. Therefore, Usability evaluation for network databases is particularly important. In the perspective of usability, this article created a set of network database usability factors combined with a case.	usability	En-gao Zhou;Jian Zhou;Binbin Li	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21660-2_32	usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;web usability;component-based usability testing;cognitive walkthrough;intelligent database;usability;computer science;system usability scale;usability engineering;universal usability;data mining;database;heuristic evaluation;world wide web;usability lab;database testing;database design;usability inspection	DB	-70.18481071793177	-25.54002791874977	132916

0014267abf8e5adf5009bbc12b0cad633557fc81	doing and undoing genders and information and communication technologies	undoing gender;self inclusion;ict;women technologists;doing gender	With the emergence of Information and Communication technologies and third wave feminism, new opportunities for women involved in ICT have been emphasized with critical optimism.  Feminists of technology have approached gender and technology from diverse conceptions and feminisms. Nowadays feminist research is moving from the concern of numbers and the digital divide, to focus on inclusion and the presence of women in ICT and analyze their experiences in technological fields.  These current feminisms introduce the notions of doing and undoing gender in relation to technology, pointing to a mutually constitutive process of gender and technology that develops in a fluid and dynamic manner. Therefore, gender and ICT relationship is no longer understood in a deterministic manner or with no agency given to women, but in a way that gender and technology become coproduced in a mutable, fluid, dynamic, interactive and performative process where gender is not only being done and undone, but also the technologies and their relationship with gender. Thus, it is considered that both gender and technology may not be fixed concepts, but dynamic and changing over time and situations, making it possible to recognize and open new possibilities for change and transformation through feminist politics.  In this sense, we consider that gender is being done when the tendency is to emphasize femininity in contrast to the hegemonic masculinity, resulting in difference. Otherwise, we understand that gender is being undone in those situations that a break with binarisms and / or heteronormativity is produced, producing a different doing gender to that expected from a woman and / or challenging the dual gender binary, even when producing certain degendering. Similarly, we understand that ICT are being done when the discourses and practices on the design and use of ICT are associated with artifacts, occupations and sectors traditionally considered technological. Conversely ICT are being undone, for example, when they become hybridized with other ICT issues and areas less traditionally associated with technology or, somehow, emphasize communication and information.  Based on these theoretical positions we explore how gender is being done and undone and, in turn, how ICT is being done and undone in the processes of self-inclusion of women in ICT. We consider the process of self-inclusion to be dynamic and fluid, occurring over time and going beyond access. This is to say that self-inclusion implies accessing ICT, but also remaining, advancing, recognizing it, and being recognized, as well as transforming and contributing to ICT.  We depart from the experiences of a sample of women artists and computer technologists based in Barcelona. In order to select them we considered that both the concept of women as well as ICT could be fluid and mutable and therefore could be troubled. Understanding women and ICT in an inclusive and critical sense, we questioned the understanding of the categories imposed from outside, to understand them from the inside, in a way open to alternative interpretations of the same participants. Therefore, the sample included transgender experiences, and also other sexual orientations beyond being heterosexual. Similarly, we troubled ICT, understanding it beyond the studies and ICT occupations traditionally considered ICT and turned our attention to other areas than could capture their hybrid and transversal condition, such as technoart, where women seem to be better represented, at least in numbers. A qualitative analysis was carried out in a way that their experiences were collected through interviews and focus groups. Firstly, 22 episodic interviews, that combined the narrative and the semi-structured interview, were conducted in order to study their ICT trajectories in relation to gender. Secondly, 2 mini focus groups were performed in order to delve into key issues in a collective way. In total then, 28 women participated in our research; half of them were artistic technologists and the other half computer technologists. Those interviews and focus groups were transcribed and analyzed using Atlas.ti software in a bottom up process. In doing so we intended to answer the main question: how, and to what extent, the research participants were doing and undoing gender and ICT in their processes of self-inclusion in ICT?  Given the ICT context of the participants, they all shared the experience of being in a qualitatively masculinised environment (referring to culture, understood as masculine norms and values). In the case of computer technologists, quantitatively speaking as well, they all commented on the fact that they were a minority in their courses or working environments. This implies that environment and technology practices are gendered and therefore those women will often be doing and undoing gender in a masculinised context and under a heteronormative gender regime. In this sense the existence of a certain number of women technologists practicing advanced ICT could be considered a form of undoing gender, because their practices are immersed in activities traditionally considered masculine. At the same time, their ICT practice could be seen to be undoing ICT or, at least, the traditional conception of ICT linked to masculinity and certain characteristics and associated ways of doing ICT. Therefore with their advanced ICT practices these women might be undoing gender, but also undoing ICT. In any case, what we show in this article is that the processes of doing and undoing gender and ICT become more complex than this.  The analysis of the participants' discourses on their ICT practices show how gender and ICT are being done and undone generating a combined and performative multiplicity of actions of gender and ICT, situated, changing over time and situations and, on occasions, even contradictorily. In addition, we also argue that gender could be done and undone in parallel, at the same time, and even that gender could be done and undone in a changing manner during the course of life, and similarly with ICT in relation to gender. For example, one of the participants commented that when she does the sound check before an electronic music concert she is consciously playing masculine and feminine at the same time. Thus, she incorporates elements of self-promotion and shows herself competent using technical language and doing ICT, as well as very competitive through her attitudes, in a way of undoing gender. However, at the same time, she is doing gender by being open to a soft dialogue and emphasizing feminine communicative forms. Similarly, in relation to doing and undoing ICT when some of the participants were involved in the Caneluntu experience they were doing ICT by installing Ubuntu in their computers. However, they were consciously undoing ICT when relating it to cooking, as well as they were doing gender in a collective way, in a women only group.  One of the most interesting issues emerging from the analysis is that what used to be presented as inexplicable, paradoxical and impossible in a previous logic of gender identities, fixed, essential and binary, makes sense when it opens to question gender identities, and thus, to gender performativity and fluidity, and also in relation to ICT. In this regard, the participants were not performing according to the hegemonic masculinity or emphasized femininity, but, above all, they were doing and undoing gender on a continuum of gender and in relation and interacting with the context in a fluid manner. In this sense, they were strengthening the intermediate positions in a gender continuum instead of causing a pendulum motion. This allowed them to move smoothly through the different specific situations they encountered in their ICT trajectories. To understand gender as constructed and fluid implies that this can similarly occur among many men, as the discourses of the participants have shown. Therefore, this situating in the midst becomes reinforced. In the same way, this happens to ICT if the practice is understood as a dynamic and fluid continuum. ICT, a priori, neither impacts positively nor negatively on women, but they are being done and undone in relation to gender and this could also bring transformative changes. Change is possible if we discard essential, immutable and binary concepts of gender. Furthermore, it is feasible if we recognize the importance of the agency in relation and constant interaction within a dynamic environment. Finally, it is possible if the same is applied to ICT.  In the process of doing and undoing gender and ICT, especially when reflexive practices beyond binarisms are taking place, women could contribute to critically examining and transforming current gender relations, as well as ICT concepts and practices, breaking the domination of hegemonic masculinity associated with ICT. This process can result in accommodating women in ICT. As the word expresses, rather than integrating women in ICT, women might be accommodating (to) them. That is, women would be changing themselves and the way they are doing gender, but they would also be producing changes in their environments and in the definitions and ICT practices.  Therefore, it is necessary that both the research and the measures that are designed to improve gender and technology relations move beyond numbers towards a concern on qualitative issues. Thus, we must recognize the heterogeneity of gender and ICT, as well as its dynamic, fluid and situated practice. This would facilitate the process of self-inclusion of women in ICT and would express how gender and ICT are mutually produced, as well as opening the way to a transformative process of accommodation of women with ICT.	artifact (software development);computer;consciousness;dominating set;emergence;experience;focus group;gender hci;immutable object;interaction;jargon;semiconductor industry;situated;smoothing;top-down and bottom-up design;triune continuum paradigm;ubuntu;undo	Núria Vergés Bosch;Ana M.

The trans-classroom teacher who moves between the two environments, transferring ideas, strategies, and practices from one to the other, is a mental migrant. The transformations -- of the teacher and of the course -- that occur in these migrations and the two-way interactions between face-to-face and online teaching are the focus of this study. As teachers adapt their courses for the online environment, they are forced to re-examine the course design, reconsider curriculum strategies, and make many decisions about what to take out and what to keep, what to add and what to substitute. The implication for faculty who would like to implement mobile learning in their online or traditional courses is that they can begin by making content and information available to students in formats easily accessible by mobile phone or laptop computer. This would be a logical first step, since a majority of students and faculty already use these tools in many of their daily activities. Other tools, such as video iPods and MP3 players, can be phased in gradually. The following ideas could be implemented immediately with little to no additional cost. Most basic cell phones today can send and receive text messages, voice mail, and e-mail. E-mail is a convenient way to communicate information to the learning community, so the instructor can begin by sending class-wide """"broadcast"""" e-mails that students can access via a variety of mobile devices."""	atm turbo;application programming interface;email;information superhighway;interaction;laptop;mp3;mobile device;mobile phone;network switch;source-to-source compiler;terrain rendering	Konstantinos Kalemis	2011	2011 Third International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems	10.1109/INCoS.2011.163	learning community;distance education;simulation;mobile telephony;computer science;connectivity;operating system;mobile device;multimedia;mobile computing	HCI	-69.13556859770415	-31.07040716552543	133507

As digital textbooks become more common in formal learning environments, there is an opportunity to embed technology that represents our growing understanding of best pedagogical practices into the textbook itself. Integrating collaborative technologies into a textbook platform provides substantial opportunities for facilitating classroom discourse surrounding the textbook content. However, to be successful in a digital textbook, these technologies have to be perceived by students as useful, and must function well on the tablet platform. This paper proposes the integration of Q&A into a digital textbook platform as a way of facilitating productive collaboration, designing for the tablet, and engaging students with the technology. We describe our implementation of an integrated Q&A system and digital textbook, and outline the results of a pilot study that demonstrate how the Q&A system might be effectively used by groups of students.	digital textbook;prototype;tablet computer	Erin Walker;Rohit Chakravarthi;J.

Implementation is often so rapid that demonstration of intervention efficacy by investigators, and establishment of research and development priorities by funding bodies tend to be more reactive than proactive. An examination of the dynamic unfolding of the history of our young discipline may help us recognize the facilitators of current practice and identify the barriers that limit greater progress. This paper presents a first step towards the examination of the past and future growth of VR-based rehabilitation by presenting the use of concept maps to explore the publication history of application of VR to rehabilitation.

As stakeholders call for technological innovation to address the realities of the global migration crisis, HCI researchers in and outside of academia engage with the issues faced by humanitarian responders, refugees and communities. Our exploratory study at UNHCR Zau0027atari Syrian Refugee Camp in Jordan highlights the creative ways young people co-opt technology to perform information work. We collected data through a survey, diaries, and observations. Findings offer important insights. First, hacking at Zau0027atari is highly gendered, with only boys observed engaging in the activity. Second, the range of young hackersu0027 activities indicate the following: a) youth help their family and community through technology; b) benefits include getting paid and feeling empowered by their role of technology experts; and c) a connected learning environment emerges. Finally, the physical location where youth are co-opting technology is important in building capacity.	emoticon;human–computer interaction	Eiad Yafi;Katya Yefimova;Karen E.

All were oriented towards creating a shared environment supporting a small community of people: about two to around twenty members were expected to inhabit the media space. All provided others with a sense of presence through portrait images and/or snapshot-based video of its members, and all emphasised creation and sharing of real-time groupware artefacts. They differed in that each was designed around a different metaphor: multiple rooms for Teamrooms, a shared live bulletin board for the Notification Collage, and an expandable sidebar that contained multiple places for Community Bar. This chapter briefly reflects on how the systems and their metaphors served as a communal place. We saw that many factors – both large and small – profoundly affected how these media spaces were adopted by the community. We also saw that there was a tension between the explicit structures offered by media space design (rooms, places, bulletin boards and so on) vs. the very light weight and often implicit ways that people form and reform into groups and how they attend to information in the real world. _____________________ S.

Along the same lines, and propelled by the increased need for information technology (IT) professionals worldwide, we implemented a students' survey during the fall of 2015 in Norway's primary university for technological education. In this initiative we aim to identify reasons that may be contributing to high dropout rates, low rates of participation by females and aspects important for the efficient preparation of young people for careers in computer science and information technology. The results provide valuable insights and allow us to take appropriate measures for enhancing students' learning experience in the computer and information sciences.	dropout (neural networks);information and computer science;information science	Michail N.

80696412fd8bba85251a86ba38337e2bc8eddc75	curious minds wonder alike: studying multimodal behavioral dynamics to design social scaffolding of curiosity		Curiosity is the strong desire to learn or know more about something or someone. Since learning is often a social endeavor, social dynamics in collaborative learning may inevitably influence curiosity. There is a scarcity of research, however, focusing on how curiosity can be evoked in group learning contexts. Inspired by a recently proposed theoretical framework [30] that articulates an integrated socio-cognitive infrastructure of curiosity, in this work, we use data-driven approaches to identify fine-grained social scaffolding of curiosity in child-child interaction, and propose how they can be used to elicit and maintain curiosity in technology-enhanced learning environments. For example, we discovered sequential patterns of multimodal behaviors across group members and we describe those that maximize an individual’s utility, or likelihood, of demonstrating curiosity during open-ended problem-solving in group work. We also discovered, and describe here, behaviors that directly or in a mediated manner cause curiosity related conversational behaviors in the interaction, with twice as many interpersonal causal influences compared to intrapersonal ones. We explain how these findings form a solid foundation for developing curiosity-increasing learning technologies or even assisting a human coach to induce curiosity among learners.	causality;design rationale;multimodal interaction;nonlinear gameplay;problem solving;social dynamics;socio-cognitive;technical support	Tanmay Sinha;Zhen Bai;Justine Cassell	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-66610-5_20	knowledge management;curiosity;interest;computer science;group work;collaborative learning;intrapersonal communication;wonder;social dynamics;interpersonal communication	ML	-64.00942185887591	-37.8762359572545	134937

Indeed, in many instances, the digital divide has widened in the last year."""" From the Internet's earliest days, there has been concern about its possible pernicious social effects. Even as millions began Internet surfing, critics averred the Internet was also harming users by destroying social interaction and eroding community involvement. Yet we may ask, what have been the experiences of the bulk of Internet users? Have they experienced loss of friends and involvement in the world due to Internet use, as claimed? Has their social world become hollow? These questions need to be addressed with the best data available. We are trying to answer these questions as part of the Syntopia Project, which has tracked growth and influence in ordinary life of the Internet since the mid-1990s. The Project's basic conclusion in 2002 was that the online and off-line world are becoming blended, and that concerns about lack of community are overblown. This view has been further reinforced by results from our most recent survey.  In February and March, 2007, we conducted a nationally representative survey of 1404 Americans 18 years of age and older. This survey explored several dimensions of the way people are using the Internet, including how much they are involved in games and online simulations, their feelings of community, and the extent to which they are making online friendships, including friendships that migrate from the virtual world to the physical world. We found that 67% of respondents (N = 943) were Internet users (compared to the 71% reported by the Pew Internet in American Life Project, and the 70% reported by Internet World Stats, (both of which included people below the age of 18). Surprisingly, in light of all the concern about a gender gap in terms of Internet usage, there were almost identical levels of usage by men and women (a trend that we discerned as early as our 2000 survey).  Many respondents use the Internet intensively. About one out of three respondents say they spend three or more hours on the Internet in a typical day, while two thirds of users spend one or two hours a day (47% estimate one hour a day, and 20% estimate two hours per day). 28% estimate they use it between three to nine hours per day, and 5% are online more than nine hours a day. There were no significant differences between males and females across these levels of Internet usage.  Given its image as something that only teens do (and that we only surveyed those 18 or older), our results showed that multiplayer gaming is thriving with 9.7% of Internet users playing them. We asked """"Do you play online games that involve other players? Like Second Life, World of Warcraft or the SIMS""""? Males (5.4%) play them in slightly greater proportion than females (4.3%).  At the Internet's outset, there was much concern about the isolating and potentially depressing effects of the Internet. While our 2007 survey did not definitively address these questions, it did find that one-fifth of Internet users consider themselves to be """"a member of an online community."""" There was practically no difference between males and females in the answers to this question. Moreover, there was very little difference between the genders in terms of how many friends they made online -- a median of about five.  In fact, far from isolating people from social interaction, the Internet is a source of new face-to-face friendships, perhaps restoring some of the sociability that has been eroded due to television and suburbia (as argued persuasively by Putnam in Bowling Alone [2001]). As Table 1 shows, the Internet has spawned many new virtual friendships. About 16% of respondents have made a friend through the Internet. As was the case with Internet community, there is virtually no difference in male (17%) versus female (14%) responses to these questions.  In addition, just over half (54%) of these people who have made a new online friend have gone on to meet the new friend in person, with slightly more males (59%) than females (50%) doing so. A quick but very rough extrapolation can be made to estimate the number of new face-to-face friendships. In the United States there are approximately 225 million people over the age of 18; as approximately 70% of them are online, this means that there are approximately 157.5 million adults online. Assuming 16% of these made even just one friend on line, this results in an estimated 25.2 million new friendships. Continuing the assumption, if 54% of those went on to meet two new friends in person (based on our data, and assuming just one meeting with each), that would mean that there have been 27 million face-to-face meetings due to the Internet involvement. Of course, this is only crude estimate, yet nonetheless it clearly gives a sense that the Internet is a pro-social technology.  Our data also refute the notion that the Internet is still the domain of males, geeks, and young people. In 1999, the NTIA report there is still a significant digital divide. While these groups continue to have an impressive presence online, the face of the today's Internet is much more reflective of the overall population, at least with respect to gender. In particular, sharp assertions about the Internet being discriminatory against, irrelevant to, or unfriendly towards females finds very little support it in our current national survey (as in our 2000 survey). To the extent computer professionals dedicated to producing new Internet-based services may have labored under a cloud of fear that their work was exacerbating loneliness, gender divides, or the dissipation of social engagement, the findings of this recent survey represent good news."""	blended threat;extrapolation;geek;internet;online and offline;online community;relevance;second life;social reality;virtual world;web-based simulation;world of warcraft	James E.

In doing so, Heidegger highlights the purpose of technology as the bringing-forth of that which is concealed so that in its presencing, it is made available for ordering as standing-reserve. To define modern technology, Heidegger compares the handiwork of the artisan with the industrial processes obvious at the time of writing, which are largely those of the industrial complex of the twentieth century. We question whether this comparison holds true in the twenty-first century by applying Heidegger’s deliberations with modern technology as it is viewed now: service-oriented computing applications. We find that the essence of twenty-first century technology differs somewhat from Heidegger’s.	service-oriented infrastructure	Alan T.

However, much of today's Internet-based teaching is limited to student access of Web-based multimedia documents. In this paper we describe new dimensions in distributed education that are possible in synchronous sessions where the students interact with the teacher in real time. We review and elaborate on the nature of the MUVE, a spatially oriented, network-accessed software environment that uses persistent object technology to promote student creativity and allow continuity between online sessions. We describe our experiences in using a MUVE to enable distributed education at the college level in graduate and undergraduate courses, and its use with high school students in the DARPA Computer-Assisted Education and Training Initiative (CAETI).	c++;internet;scott continuity;virtual reality;virtual world	J.

The goal is to both discuss the power of these designs, but also the challenges of scaling such innovative learning experiences internationally. These four units (one focused on mathematics, science, language arts, and social studies) are situated in an online, multiplayer videogame called Quest Atlantis, supporting over 25,000 children worldwide. Each presented unit has gone through multiple iterations of implementation, analysis, and redesign, informed by empirical data and our evolving theoretical framework. In reviewing both results from comparison studies and differences in international engagement with the units, our accounts will illuminate the theory transformational play, how the theory has shaped design and interpretations of findings.

This type of economy argues for reconceptualizing cognitive skills acquisition as a lifelong process. Research has shown that worked-out examples are the key to initial cognitive skill acquisition and, therefore, critical to lifelong learning. The extent to which learners' pro®t from the study of examples, however, depends on how well they explain the solutions of the examples to themselves. This paper discusses our own research on different types of computer-based learning environments that indirectly foster self-explanations by (a) fostering anticipative reasoning, (b) supporting self-explanations during the transition from example study to problem solving, and (c) supporting self-explanation activities with instructional explanations. It also discusses ways of leveraging new computer and video technologies to enhance these environments by representing problem situations and their concepts dynamically. The paper concludes by suggesting that these learning environments, if employed successfully, can encourage systematic, lifelong learning.	chi;cognitive architecture;emoticon;heart rate variability;information;jones calculus;nl (complexity);problem solving;task manager;tom gruber;world wide web	Alexander Renkl;Robert K.

a5e948d0f4ed27f51730d914bd400062fc8c6391	harnessing information and communication technologies for effective knowledge creation: shaping the future of education		Purpose – Education is subject to the same pressures as a business, it has to spur innovation, improve customer service and achieve operational excellence. Education is expected to solve intricate problems that heralded the twenty-first century. Niche areas emerged in education that need further study and research. The authors postulate such demands may be met by information and communication technologies (ICTs) that opened up the avenue for innovation and experimentation in education. One such innovation is online learning and massive open online courses (MOOCs) that represent immense opportunities in education. With their advent, even the permanent relevance of physical classrooms has been questioned. The purpose of this paper is to answer to all these questions and attempts to fill gaps in the understanding of the future of education. Design/methodology/approach – The paper came into being after a review of literature pertaining to the changing ecosystem of education and an analysis of newer platforms like MOOCs. The paper surveyed books, scholarly articles, reports, conference proceedings and online databases in the area of education and related technological developments. Findings – The existence of MOOCs in the education landscape cannot be ignored. This is proven by the fact that MOOC enrollment surpassed 35 million users in 2015. MOOCs were considered a popular concept in the developed world to start with. But, today MOOCs are being offered by universities in developing nations too. As the number of participant countries increases, MOOCs in vernacular languages are being developed to overcome the language barrier. The paper found that the online model cannot replace the brick and mortar model completely. Rather, it will complement it by providing an enriching experience to various stakeholders, including the learner and the instructor. In the future, students will have the advantage of a blended classroom where the best of online and offline models converge into an optimal experience. Research limitations/implications – As the theme of the paper is new and the educational landscape continues to evolve, it is very difficult to determine the pace of transformation of education. However, the authors have tried to suggest a conceptual framework for the future in education, subject to empirical validation. Practical implications – This paper helps us understand that we are in a rapidly evolving scenario where innovations have the potential to disrupt the existing model. Such disruptions can have behavioral, economical and social ramifications. A better understanding of such alterations will help academicians equip themselves for evolving classrooms and the changing nature of their jobs. The new ICT enabled ecosystem will also try to overcome issues related to the quality of education and knowledge dissemination. Originality/value – The present paper is a comprehensive study of the opportunities and challenges posed by emerging classrooms.	book;converge;database;ecosystem;job stream;massive open online course;mortar methods;niche blogging;noise shaping;online and offline;online machine learning;relevance	Vikas Gupta;Namita Jain	2017	J.

The way Indian organisations have developed their learning platforms and learning delivery has been instrumental in equipping a global workforce with the required knowledge and skills. This has, in turn, reduced time-to-market and built up a repository of knowledge and a culture of learning through correct assessment of the socio-cultural nuances that are congenial to organisational learning in India. This paper is aimed at finding out how organisations in India have been able to do that and what kind of learning delivery methods and techniques provide a good learning experience for employees in Indian organisations, forming the basis for an Organisational Learning System.

87c213615f8af38ccd658f54d2037fd88a1979f2	a hierarchical tv system for different communication services		This paper examines the library system and its services in China’s Radio and TV Universities (RTVUs). The paper begins with an introduction about the profile of the library system in China’s RTVUs, focusing on its dispersed and multi-level structure and division of functions. Then the paper examines the library services in RTVUs, stressing on its characteristics in Chinese context. Finally, the paper discusses the current innovation towards electronic and/or virtual library services within China’s national RTVUs system, its problems and the future development. The Profile of Library System in China’s RTVUs Libraries, together with academics and laboratories are recognized as three essential elements of educational resources in China’s universities. China’s RTVUs, as a national distance teaching system, identify library together with course development center, computing center and laboratory center as the fundamental infrastructure and facilities for distance teaching and learning. China’s RTVUs have built up a dispersed library system with multi-level structure and division of functions. In the mainland of China, this national system of distance teaching constitutes 1 Central RTVU (CRTVU), 44 provincial-level RTVUs (PRTVUs), 831 city-level branch schools and more than 1,600 county-level working stations. Each of these RTVUs’ institutions has built up its own independent library. It is a dispersed and hierarchical system with different functions for various level libraries. The library in CRTVU mainly provides services to its full-time academic and other professional staff, but not to students directly. The libraries in 44 PRTVUs serve for both academics and students. The libraries in branch schools and work stations mainly serve for their students locally, and the academics as well. Such a dispersed and hierarchical system of libraries is suitable for China’s multi-level RTVUs and their teaching and learning nationwide. There were 21.1 million volume of total collections in whole library system of China’s RTVUs in 1996. Taking CRTVU into account only, there were over 110 thousand volume of Chinese and other language books and other kinds of publication, and nearly 20 thousand units of audio-visual materials including computer diskettes and various kinds of laser discs. The Library Services and Some Characteristics in China’s RTVUs The library system in China’s RTVUs provide various kinds of services for both academics and students. Except its dispersed and hierarchical structure and division of functions mentioned above, there are some other characteristics deserved to be discussed.	book;digital library;floppy disk;level structure;library (computing);library classification	Broder Wendland	1984			computer network;two-way communication;multimedia;computer science	PL	-70.07962235296455	-24.793866340442634	136701

Too much attention was given to the technological aspects. Teachers learned to work with hardand software. A typical example is the European Computer Driving License (ECDL). A lot of people attend courses on text processing, spreadsheets... but using a Virtual Learning Environment like e.g. Blackboard or Moodle demands more didactical than technical skills. Especially e-learning and blended learning is too demanding to let teachers learn to use these tools only by experimenting. More and more is generally accepted that the e-learning competencies for teachers require a longer course. Which competences and how these can be realized is the main focus of this paper?

15810831590bcbaf0c05acd79d45b5368fe0c82a	applied knowledge transfer to european smes by expertise networks using mixed reality		Our modern industrial and service society is shaped by innovations, which are creating new technologies, products and technical systems, on the one hand, and professional services, on the other hand, in order to develop new markets and create future-proof jobs. However, demographic development indicates that a large proportion of older and experienced employees will be retiring, while the number of high school graduates is diminishing. In the medium-term, this parallel development is going to cause a shortage of engineers and skilled labor. One particular challenge is to make technological options utilizable for learning and incorporate them in companies directly and in the inter-company vocational training. The paper describes on the basis of two industrial case studies the utilization of mixed reality technologies as well for education and training as for technical knowledge transfer. The required technological and the didactical basics will be explained. The paper concludes with a best practice approach for transfer of expertise from research organizations to the processing industry based on the “German-Baltic Expertise Network for Virtual and Augmented Reality” project.	mixed reality	Eberhard Blümel;Helge Fredrich;Andre Winge	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-29231-6_8	economic shortage;mixed reality;business;knowledge management;best practice;emerging technologies;augmented reality;knowledge transfer;vocational education	Vision	-75.85956366165486	-31.562935620372063	137173

This resulted in a substantial number of people with hands-on experience. However, to our knowledge, no research has been performed to harvest this source of information. By means of a survey with closed and open-ended questions, we explore the opinions of 50 serious game and CALL experts on serious games' potential for foreign language learning. The first part of the paper discusses attitudes on serious games and learning. In general, we discern a rather strong belief in the potential of learning games. The second part of the paper zooms in on foreign language learning through games whereby some remarkable results emerge on the possibilities and limitations of foreign language learning games. Next, we discuss respondents' opinions on issues regarding the integration of foreign language learning games in a classroom context and on their design. The final part of the paper elaborates on a SWOT analysis of foreign language learning games resulting in a nuanced view on the opportunities and limitations of foreign language learning games. As a consequence, this paper not only identifies topics which bear a broad consensus among experts, but also shows that strong differences in opinion exist.	blue waters;hands-on computing;information source;nonlinear gameplay	Frederik De Grove;Peter Mechant;Jan Van Looy	2010		10.1145/1823818.1823830	simulation;knowledge management;political science;management science	NLP	-67.17747242724383	-34.68574012794525	137186

We analyzed log-file data from the CPS item Climate Control encompassing N 1⁄4 16,219 students from 44 countries and economies. In Research Question 1, we related the application of an optimal exploration strategy (i.e., vary-one-thing-at-at-time, VOTAT) to performance on this specific problem and to overall level of CPS proficiency, both on an individual and on the country level. In Research Question 2, we identified several groups of students with different levels of nonmastery on a fine-grained level. Results indicated that (1) the VOTAT strategy was strongly related to performance on the Climate Control item as well as to overall problem solving proficiency, and (2) that there were different levels of non-mastery that ranged from applying no systematic strategic behavior to actually applying VOTAT but still failing to solve the item. On the backdrop of these results, we discuss implications and future potentials of log-file analyses in educational large-scale assessments for researchers, teachers, and policy makers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Human-computer interaction researchers have investigated how understanding the values of users can improve technology design, but until now few such investigations have involved systems for seniors. Similarly, although various aspects of networked communities have been researched, few studies have explored ones involving seniors. This interpretivist/constructivist study reveals what a particular community run by and expressly for seniors, value about their community. Of the six key social values identified, their single most important value was ‘belonging to a community of peers’. These values have implications for the design of online communities involving seniors.	online community	Oliver K. Burmeister	2012	J.

As a way to achieve this goal, an increasing number of studies have paid attention to the integration of CALL technology into the teacher education program and into the classroom. Nonetheless, there is little specific research into L2 teachers’ integration of technology into the classroom in relation to their prior technology education. As a means of better understanding the complexity of L2 teachers’ integration of technology into the classroom, this paper proposes a spherical model of such integration by reviewing and synthesizing the relevant literature. Drawing on this model, the paper emphasizes the importance of CALL teacher education with regard to L2 teachers’ integration of technology into the classroom. Next, it discusses how the model can contribute to future research on such integration.	cpu cache;spherical model	Kwang Hee Hong	2010	ReCALL	10.1017/S095834400999019X	psychology;mathematics education;educational technology;computer science;knowledge management;technology education;pedagogy	HCI	-75.01577759996827	-36.314059586597004	138833

It also aims to gather students’ opinions on the importance and helpfulness of various traditional and online information sources in their thesis-writing process. This study would help to develop a better understanding of the roles and impacts of these information sources in the current networked academic infrastructure. Inspired by the Information Search Process model, we divided the process into six stages and conducted three separate surveys that covered students’ feelings, thoughts and actions, as well as other important factors that might affect their behaviors in each of the stages. Our study shows that both the feelings and thoughts of students changed during the different stages of the process, and that they were generally consistent with the descriptions in the Information Search Process model. The study indicates that it is beneficial to use the Information Search Process model as the starting point for studying the student thesis-writing processes. As the outcome of the study, we ultimately proposed a multi-stage model for Chinese undergraduate students’ thesis-writing process.	database;information management;information processing;information retrieval;information search process;information seeking behavior;information source;librarian;list of information schools;process modeling;theory;user modeling;web search engine	Dan Wu;Wanyu Dang;Daqing He;Renmin Bi	2017	JOLIS	10.1177/0961000616654960	human–computer information retrieval;library science;information search process;helpfulness;feeling;cognitive models of information retrieval;computer science;knowledge management	HCI	-73.84652666129627	-26.27757815741985	139043

For example, the role of learning analytics in the current paradigm of student-centred and competence-based learning, information about successful learning analytics-based interventions, cross-validation of prior research, standards for learning analytics, or learning analytics and instructional design. In addition, the emergence and growth of new technologies in educational contexts (e.g. smartphones, virtual and augmented reality, social networks), and the ever changing nature of existing ones, bring new challenges and opportunities for research and practice in learning analytics."""	augmented reality;cross-validation (statistics);emergence;programming paradigm;smartphone;social network	Ángel Hernández-García;Miguel Ángel Conde González	2016		10.1145/3012430.3012533	analytics;cooperative learning;educational technology;computer science;knowledge management;data science;learning sciences;data mining;business analytics;active learning;business intelligence;cultural analytics;software analytics;open learning;synchronous learning	HCI	-74.12396883596693	-37.193337027150214	139675

Design/methodology/approach – Based on a set of identified typical academic tasks for undergraduate students, three research questions were designed around the students’ usage and views of information resources for completing these tasks. Web-accessible questionnaires were used to collect data from participants in two universities in the USA and China, and the data were analyzed using quantitative methods, which included several statistic methods. Findings – The results confirm that undergraduate students use different information resources for various academic tasks. In their tasks, online electronic resources including search engines are the most commonly used resources, particularly for complex academic tasks. Social networking sites are not used for the students’ individual academic tasks, and traditional resources still play equal or more important roles in certain specific academic tasks. Students in collaborative tasks look for resources that make it easy to share documents. Participants from the two countries also exhibit interesting and important differences in their usage of information resources. Originality/value – This study examines undergraduate students’ usages and views of different information resources in their various academic tasks, and pays special attention to the impacts of being from their different countries. The study also considers both students’ individual academic tasks and collaborative tasks. This study is an invaluable addition to the information seeking behaviour literature.	information seeking behavior;internet;web search engine	Daqing He;Dan Wu;Zhen Yue;Anna Fu;Kim Thien Vo	2012	Aslib Proceedings	10.1108/00012531211281715	the internet;computer science;knowledge management;data science;multimedia;law;information retrieval	HCI	-74.23596556127704	-26.39756633089893	139704

We detail our motivations for using SM tools in science learning and the design decisions we made over a 2year, designbased research project. Our designs grew from our experiences using SM tools in the field and codesigning these systems with children. Our longitudinal case study and design narrative contribute to our understanding of the design and use of SM tools to support children's scientific inquiry. Specifically, we detail (1) the affordances and constraints we gleaned from the design evolution of SINQ to ScienceKit, (2) the potential of SM to guide learning behaviors, and (3) the role of SM for children and the community of adults and peers who support them.	social media	Jason C.

90747966bfeb3cf957a006199fc151af85db8a80	electronic support for grade administration at the university of delaware	electronic support;grade administration	Assigning grades for college courses is a timeconsuming process. Faculty typically spend a substantial fraction of time with record keeping and submitting grades to the campus Registrar for recording. The Information Technologies unit at the University of Delaware engages in a continuing effort to reduce the administrative burden associated with grading, thereby freeing faculty time for teaching and research. Five aspects of grading are processed electronically at the University of Delaware. These are l Distribute current roster file from the Registrar to faculty l Machine score exams using optical scan forms l Keep grade records using a locally-written gradebook program run on the central UNIX machines l Submit grades electronically to the Registrar using a locally-written program for entering grades, verifying the submission, and sending the result to the Registrar l Verify grades submitted electronically to the Registrar using a secure Web form This paper summarizes the process with particular emphasis on the gradebook program, the electronic grade submission program, and the Web verification form. The gradebook program uses the roster received from the Registrar by electronic mail as a starting point. Machine-scored or hand-entered grades are matched to the correct students by comparing social security numbers. The gradebook calculates the average or, sum of individual evaluation items to produce a final score for the course and assigns letter grades. It can then be used to submit grades to the Registrar. We also have developed a stand-alone program for electronically submitting grades that does not depend on the gradebook program.

This study describes an experiment carried out with a group of pre-service teachers from a Spanish University in which Facebook was employed as a resource to develop the teaching and learning process. Specifically, it was applied as a strategy designed to improve relations among the students in the classroom. In-depth interviews were held with twenty students and their teacher to analyse the influence of this emerging technology on knowledge building and the establishing of closer links among students and between students and teachers. The results acknowledge the value of this resource, both for the teacher and the students themselves, in the following areas: classroom climate, teaching-learning process, virtual tutoring, foreign language practice and digital competence acquisition. In the final section of the article, we put forward questions and issues for future research.	social network	Inmaculada Gómez Hurtado;José Manuel Coronel Llamas	2014	IJOPCD	10.4018/ijopcd.2014070103	mathematics education;political science;teaching method;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-74.6462638943662	-36.03164571264227	139812

In this paper the goal is to discover whether there is a similar internal process going on in CA problem solving, regardless of the complexity of the problem. We are to monitor the “vital signs” of a cultural system during the problem solving process to determine whether it was on track or not and infer the complexity class of a social system based on its “vital signs”. We first demonstrate how the learning curve for a Cultural System is supported by the interaction of the knowledge sources. Next a circulatory system metaphor is used to describe how the exploratory knowledge sources generate new information that is distributed to the agents via the Social Fabric network. We then conclude that the Social Metrics are able to indicate the progress of the problem solving in terms of its ability to periodically lower the innovation cost for the performance of a knowledge source which allows the influenced population to expand and explore new solution possibilities as seen in the dispersion metric. Hence we present the possibility to assess the complexity of a system's environment by looking at the Social Metrics.	complexity class;cultural algorithm;cultural system;metrics (networking);problem solving;process modeling;social system	Xiangdong Che;Robert G.

95a317843963ffee6c9a75505157d96badeae89f	a systematic review of learning analytics intervention contributing to student success in online learning		Recent developments in Learning Analytics have attracted much attention from researchers and practitioners, as well as diverse stakeholders, in exploring the potential for Learning Analytics to enhance learning and teaching practices. Hence, this paper presents a literature review of the use of the Learning Analytics Intervention implemented in various educational institutions in order to improve students' success and engagement in their learning, particularly for at-risk students. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of how Learning Analytics Intervention has been utilised in the educational institution, the types of theory applied in the intervention and what tools are used in the intervention. Additionally, the application of Learning Analytics Intervention, its purpose, effects and examples are also discussed in this paper. The findings show that most of the Learning Analytics Interventions have an impact on students' success in their learning, although some of them have little impact or no significant effect, and various Learning Analytics tools and strategies are discovered. Lastly, it is suggested that further Learning Analytics Interventions should be developed in order to meet the needs of students.	systematic review	Kew Si Na;Zaidatun Tasir	2017	2017 International Conference on Learning and Teaching in Computing and Engineering (LaTICE)	10.1109/LaTiCE.2017.18	educational technology;active learning;educational institution;learning sciences;learning analytics;psychological intervention;computer science;knowledge management;analytics	HCI	-74.89474571963113	-37.841156856343844	140429

A theory about the process and practice of design might be important to establish design as a main subject at universities. We believe it is in the interest of many design communities -- not least the Participatory Design (PD) community -- to engage in theorizing design, on the basis of our understanding of design and design practices. This theory could be positioned as an alternative to other attempts to theorize design, for example the influential efforts of the Information Systems (IS) community. We urge the PD community to engage in collective theory building, and we present a framework intended to support our shared reflections on the design of human technologies.	information systems;reflection (computer graphics)	Jesper Simonsen;Morten Hertzum;Jørgen Lerche Nielsen;Søren Riis	2014		10.1145/2686612.2686682	design;design research;strategic design;experience design;computer science;knowledge management;environmental graphic design;management science;management;theory	HCI	-63.41827500879807	-34.23827178821986	140581

But, in fact, classic work by Piaget on how children and adults learn shows that when learners engage with peers in critical discussion of ideas concerning which they have different understandings, that contributes very effectively to learners developing deep understanding of the concepts involved. At the same time, getting students in undergraduate computing (or other technical/engineering) courses to engage with other students in thoughtful discussion of important concepts is very challenging. It can be especially difficult to get women students and students from other underrepresented groups to participate effectively in such discussions. In our work, we exploit the affordances of mobile and web technologies to address these challenges. Our approach not only helps address these challenges, it has a number of other important advantages over face-to-face discussions. We present the theoretical underpinnings of the approach, some details of our prototype implementation, preliminary results from the use of the prototype in a junior/senior level class on Software Engineering, and the design for the next version of our tool. We also discuss the possibilities and usefulness of applying this approach in a range of computing courses from traditional classrooms to MOOCs.	massive open online course;piaget's theory of cognitive development;prototype;software engineering	Swaroop Joshi;Neelam Soundarajan;Rajiv Ramnath	2015		10.1145/2676723.2691897	cooperative learning;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;pedagogy	HCI	-75.00447293767493	-37.3387660713597	141031

Knowledge remains passive, not easily transferred and applied to actual problems. Our project involving problem-based learning in computer science aims to improve this situation at Technische Universitat Mtinchen by supporting realistic case studies as part of students’ work. Our approach exploits recent trends in using computers and the Web for improving learning and teaching. We have developed an integrated environment—Munics (Munich Net-based learning in Computer Science), which supports students and teachers working on actual case studies in computer science. We want students to learn how to apply their factual knowledge in future workplace situations.	computer science	Pamela Tröndle;Heinz Mandl;Frank Fischer;Jürgen Hartmut Koch;Johann H.

What is new, however, is the wealth of telecommunications and telematics options available today that enable the provision of this high‐tech educational environment and the enlargement of the potential user base. Libraries have a central role in education, learning, and vocational training in support of increasing knowledge. The rapid evolution of information and communication technology in the learning field imposes, supports and stimulates the re‐engineering of the library. This paper provides a description of a new distance learning scenario in a library service.

As a matter of fact, MAGICAL ultimate aim is that of triggering and enhancing students' key/transversal skills among which reasoning abilities, creative attitudes and digital competence. The project investigates game creation as an innovative educational framework and addresses the development of the above mentioned abilities/attitudes by adopting a collaborative, """"learning by doing"""" approach to digital game construction (game building in groups), which is actually quite new in the field. The outcomes of the project, which is still on-going, will hopefully trace new avenues for engaging students in both highly motivating and effective game- based educational activities.

However, despite the potential for cross-cultural experiences to influence designers, American undergraduate liberal arts colleges do not typically include these topics as part of the standard computer science curriculum or as part of their general education requirements. We present a case study in exposing undergraduate students at an American liberal arts college to Japanese culture, technology and design through an immersive three-week course that includes two weeks of study in Japan. Through this cross-cultural course, students learn about Japanese culture, technology and design with an emphasis on the way these three areas are interrelated.	computer science;experience;human–computer interaction;requirement	Chin-Chuan Chen;Tien-Li Chen	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-40548-3		HCI	-68.99186939425775	-36.73937472862632	141832

Surfing the Internet has become part of our life. Based on a database recording the timing of the Internet accessing for an educational institution, we present the distributions of the time intervals in Internet surfing and single website visiting. The time interval distributions follow a power law with different exponents from user to user, which is different from the universality class with characteristic exponent 1. Actually, both the single website accessing by the grouped users and the web browsing by a single use have power-law time interval distributions with exponents ranging from 2 to 3. The results in this paper give rise to a question to the mainstream hypothesis of universality classes. Whether the time interval of access Internet exist the universality class, if it exits, what is the exponential on earth? We believe this work could provide some insights of the latent mechanism of human dynamics.	browsing;database;human dynamics;internet;time complexity;universal turing machine;universality probability	Gengsheng Zhao;Ning Zhang;Zhaoxing Liu;Jiming Li	2010	2010 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology	10.1109/WI-IAT.2010.55	power law;the internet;simulation;internet access;computer science;web page;data mining;multimedia;human dynamics;law;world wide web	Metrics	-64.21690763990418	-27.999922432810212	142066

In the centre of our interests are students and their search for reliable information sources. The paper presents results of an online survey of all the students of Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb (FHSS). Analysis will show how they search for information in electronic environment while preparing exams and writing theses. Students' usage of library catalogue, commercial databases, open access repositories, open access journals, e-learning system, social networks, social bookmarking services, scientific blogs and forums will be analysed. Nine variables will be tested by chi-square test to show whether there are statistically significant differences in information searching behaviour between students of the Department of Information and Communication Sciences (DICS) and students of other departments at the faculty. All the results will show how important is formal education for using, evaluating and retrieving reliable information sources. The results will also accent some guidelines that will help educators and librarians at the faculty in planning education of their students/users.	blog;database;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;librarian;social network	Ivana Hebrang Grgic;Petra Miocic	2012	2012 Proceedings of the 35th International Convention MIPRO		computer science;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-74.22121792286153	-26.88853833828831	142428

The concept of a Community of Practice (Wenger, 2000) is attractive in drawing together people whose work shares similar aspects, and consideration is given here to how technology can be used to develop and support such a community. In this paper, concepts from the Community of Practice literature are used to consider the development of a software environment for people working as a community in the area of lifelong learning. The intention was to design the system in an evolutionary way, using a minimal set of essential elements which would be elaborated according to user feedback. Three key design questions are considered: Who can contribute resources to such a system? What happens to existing practices? How is the community engaged? We conclude that, in lifelong learning, knowledge management supported by a software environment offers a good way to bring together communities, resources and experience, but to achieve these benefits, great care needs to be exerted in introducing the system, and maintaining existing work practices.	continuous design;knowledge management	Patrick McAndrew;Doug Clow;Josie Taylor;James Aczel	2004	BJET	10.1111/j.1467-8535.2004.00431.x	educational technology;social science;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;management science;knowledge;lifelong learning;information management;personal knowledge management;management;world wide web;pedagogy;technology	HCI	-73.91442904536808	-31.010574469145038	142798

Possible factors influencing student behaviors and attitudes toward plagiarism include ignorance, lack of personal investment in their education, situational ethics, and lack of consistent styles among and within various disciplines. Librarians are in a unique position to help prevent and detect plagiarism by forming partnerships with faculty to re-examine assignments and instructional sessions and by informing them of Internet paper mills and useful Internet search strategies. INTRODUCTION In a Seattle Timesarticle, Leon Geyer, the faculty advisor for the undergraduate honor system at Virginia Tech, was quoted as saying: “In the olden days, a student had to go to the library, dig up the information and retype it. Now you can sit in your dorm room andjust reach out, point and click (Benning, 1998, paragraph 8). Benning further stated: “Teachers and administrators agree cheating is on the rise-computers have made it so easy” (paragraph 4). HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE As Wilson Mizner said: “When you steal from one author, it’s plagiarism; ifyou steal from many, it’s research” (quoted in Bartlett, 1992, p. 631). NicoleJ. Auer, Library, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061-0434 Ellen M. Krupar, Library, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061 LIBRARY TRENDS, Vol. 49, No. 3, Winter 2001, pp. 415-432 02001 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois 416 LIBRARY TRENDS/WINTER 2001 Plagiarism was probably the second idea. Views on plagiarism have changed over time. Often, imitation in phrasing or style has been seen as complimentary or respecting the learned masters. In some art, using the same motifs or arrangements to reflect on a historical manner of creation is the proper thing to do. Students also learned how to do something by copying a finished piece. Even today, students of art paint imitations of great works in order to learn techniques such as brush strokes, use of color, or depiction of perspective. However, in such cases, the students are not passing off these imitations as an original expression of a creative impulse. Today, many students are stealing material from the Internet and turning it in as their own work, either directly from paper mills or by “cutting and pbting“ ; I 0111 p’hges;-ivi’dkbmk k h C h i a n ( ;%%? &sl-’.%&s%+?k% quotes teachers as saying that “cheating, especially in the form of plagiarized term papers, is on the rise because of the easy availability of material on the Internet” (paragraph 2). THEPROBLEM Cases from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) Undergraduate Honor System Web site illustrate what we, as a profession, must prepare ourselves and our faculties to confront. Figure 1 shows the honor court statistics at Virginia Tech for the last three years which clearly illustrate a marked increase in the total number of honor code violations in that short amount of time. Interestingly, half the cases for 1998/1999 were reported during exam week.	bartlett's bisection theorem;computer;emoticon;goto;internet;leon;librarian;machine ethics;point and click;web page;world wide web	Nicole Auer;Ellen Krupar	2001	Library Trends		psychology;library science;the internet;social science;ethics;engineering;information literacy;sociology;higher education;management;law;information technology;world wide web	ML	-66.04215874792848	-23.94978792404527	142965

This activity, organized by the Laboratory of Distance Education, Charles University in Prague within the framework of the State Information Policy (SIP) in Education Program, started in 2001, and it has become one of the top online learning activities in the country. The paper introduces the whole developed system of in-service teacher training on a “voluntary basis” and focuses on the TELMAE Science Teachers’ Online Supportive Environment, developed also at the Laboratory of Distance Education at Charles University. The TELMAE supportive environment incorporates several features and communication, information, monitoring and controlling tools used for management and coordination of distributed systems of online courses. The key factors of the project are discussed at the end of the paper. 1 The state information policy in education program outcomes The government of the Czech Republic has adopted formal public policies, in particular the State Information Policy (SIP) in Education, aimed at moving its society from a post-industrial model to an information and knowledge-based society. """"The basic objective of the state information policy is to foster and develop an information society and thereby to create the prerequisites for improving the quality of life of individual citizens...."""" [1]. The adaptation will come through expanded use of computers and their attendant technologies, such as the internet and networking, by all governmental sectors, including education. In short, the initiative is to serve as a modernizing influence for Czech society as well as serving its global interests by bringing the country in line with European Commission initiatives."""	computer;distributed computing;internet;the quality of life	Zdena Lustigova	2006		10.1007/978-0-387-34731-8_44	engineering;knowledge management;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-76.48095690473454	-32.01941897180757	143079

However, these processes do not always translate well into the professional and necessarily fluid context of engineering education scholars. This paper is a case study describing our experiences in realigning processes to provide access for one particular deaf scholar at one particular small institution, along with some reflection on how this case study might benefit others. The notion of a “turnkey solution” is a myth for disability accommodations in many professional positions, and that perpetuation of that myth can create barriers to full participation by disabled scholars in our field.	experience;turnkey	Mel Chua;Brittany Ray;Lynn Andrea Stein	2017	2017 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2017.8190512	sociology;knowledge management;turnkey;engineering education research;engineering education;interpreter	SE	-74.03803292021182	-31.355553320664896	143284

Four technologies are reviewed: Facebook, Wikipedia, Blacksburg Electronic Village, and World of Warcraft, to assess their “social affordances,” that is, how communication is supported and how the technologies provide facilities to promote social relationships, groups, and communities. The technology affordances are related to motivations for use and socio-psychological theories of group behaviour and social relationships. The review provides new insights into the nature of long-lasting conversations in social relationships, as well as how representations of individuals and social networks augment interaction.

The information system with the information technology support isn’t enough if just only on internet or implemented with internet technology. The growth of information technology as tools for helping and making people easy to use must be accompanied by wanting to make fun and happy when they make contact with the information technology itself. Basically human like to play, since childhood human have been playing, free and happy and when human grow up they can’t play as much as when human was in their childhood. We have to develop the information system which is not perform information system itself but can help human to explore their natural instinct for playing, making fun and happiness when they interact with the information system. Virtual information system is the way to present playing and having fun atmosphere on working area.	information system;internet protocol suite	Spits Warnars	2010	CoRR		information needs;information age;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;personal information management;multimedia;information technology;information system	HCI	-63.6775951621939	-25.968842261489478	143504

E-learning has now evolved from a marginal form of education to a commonly accepted alternative to traditional face-to-face education. The term can cover different delivery models ranging from courses that are delivered fully online to courses that provide some face-to-face interaction and some online provision. Within this continuum, interactive technologies can play a significant role in engaging the learner and providing a rich learning experience. This paper examines the e-phenomenon as it relates to e-learning and how different interactive technologies, such as visualisations and simulation games, can be used to enrich the learning experiences of students with different learning styles. The theory is related to the teaching of Information Systems (IS) in a postgraduate MSc Management of eBusiness course that uses a range of interactive technologies.	apache continuum;experience;information system;marginal model;simulation	Thomas M.

dd489499c52935116fcbd6bd428f165729f13412	professional learning in the midst of teaching computer science		The recent groundswell of interest in computer science education across many countries has created a pressing need for computing teachers at the secondary level. To satisfy this demand, some educational systems are drawing from their pool of in-service teachers trained in other disciplines. While these transitioning teachers can learn about computing pedagogy and subject matter at professional learning workshops, daily teaching experiences will also be a source of their learning. We studied a co-teaching program where instructional responsibilities were distributed between teachers and volunteers from the tech industry to explore how specific teaching practices supported teacher learning, with a focus on pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). Through qualitative analysis of questionnaire and interview data gathered from three teachers during one school year, we identified the practices they engaged in and how their learning related to the enactment of those practices. Our results highlight several factors that influenced the ways in which teaching practices provided participants with opportunities to learn PCK: (a) active participation of students and volunteers; (b) teacher's level of content knowledge; (c) interdependent practices; and (d) immediacy of the classroom environment.	computer science;emoticon;experience;groundswell: winning in a world transformed by social technologies;interdependence;subject matter expert turing test;technical support	Aleata Hubbard;Katie D'Silva	2018		10.1145/3230977.3230983	knowledge management;pedagogy;immediacy;interdependence;computer science;professional learning community	HCI	-77.20939312444521	-34.467311384316176	143628

25bce254c4db9dd3744a7b5f1c9e618070fba8eb	reimagining textbooks through the data lens		Textbooks are the primary vehicles for delivering subject knowledge to the students and are known to be the educational input most consistently associated with improvements in student learning. With the emergence of abundant online content, cloud computing, and electronic reading devices, textbooks are poised for transformative changes. Inspired by the emergence of the electronic medium for “printing” and “distributing” textbooks, we present our early explorations into developing a data mining based approach for enhancing the quality of electronic textbooks. Specifically, we first describe a diagnostic tool for authors and educators to algorithmically identify deficiencies in textbooks. We then discuss techniques for algorithmically augmenting different sections of a book with links to selective content mined from the Web. Our tool for diagnosing deficiencies consists of two components. Abstracting from the education literature, we identify the following properties of good textbooks: (1) Focus: Each section explains few concepts, (2) Unity: For every concept, there is a unique section that best explains the concept, and (3) Sequentiality: Concepts are discussed in a sequential fashion so that a concept is explained prior to occurrences of this concept or any related concept. Further, the tie for precedence in presentation between two mutually related concepts is broken in favor of the more significant of the two. The first component provides an assessment of the extent to which these properties are followed in a textbook and quantifies the comprehension load that a textbook imposes on the reader due to non-sequential presentation of concepts [1]. The second component identifies sections that are not written well and can benefit from further exposition. We propose a probabilistic decision model for this purpose, which is based on the syntactic complexity of writing and the notion of the dispersion of key concepts mentioned in the section [3]. For augmenting a section of a textbook, we first identify the set of key concept phrases contained in a section. Using these phrases, we find web articles that represent the central concepts presented in the section and endow the section with links to them [4]. We also describe techniques for finding images that are most relevant to a section of the textbook, while respecting the constraint that the same image is not repeated in different sections of the same chapter. We pose this problem of matching images to sections in a textbook chapter as an optimization problem and present an efficient algorithm for solving it [2]. We finally provide the results of applying the proposed techniques to a corpus of widely-used, high school textbooks published by the National Council of Educational Research and Training, India. We consider books from grades IX--XII, covering four broad subject areas, namely, Sciences, Social Sciences, Commerce, and Mathematics. The preliminary results are encouraging and indicate that developing technological approaches to embellishing textbooks could be a promising direction for research.	algorithm;book;cloud computing;data mining;emergence;existential quantification;focus;fuzzy concept;mathematical optimization;mined;optimization problem;printing;text corpus;web content;world wide web	Rakesh Agrawal	2012			computer science;artificial intelligence	AI	-72.67194578008107	-27.337743499048432	143749

This is especially true within computer systems, where heavy-tails seemingly pop up everywhere -- from degree distributions in the internet and social networks to file sizes and interarrival times of workloads. However, despite nearly a decade of work on heavy-tails they are still treated as mysterious, surprising, and even controversial.  The goal of this tutorial is to show that heavy-tailed distributions need not be mysterious and should not be surprising or controversial. In particular, we will demystify heavy-tailed distributions by showing how to reason formally about their counter-intuitive properties; we will highlight that their emergence should be expected (not surprising) by showing that a wide variety of general processes lead to heavy-tailed distributions; and we will highlight that most of the controversy surrounding heavy-tails is the result of bad statistics, and can be avoided by using the proper tools."""	computer;emergence;internet;social network;tails	Jayakrishnan Nair;Adam Wierman;Bert Zwart	2013		10.1145/2465529.2466587	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;statistics	Web+IR	-64.07266018100414	-27.913460659345525	143833

From this perspective, the learner's emotional state is interweaved with the structural elements of his/her learning functioning (both internal and external) when placed within an educational setting. The advent of new technological achievements in the accurate acquisition of the learner's affective state allows for the redesign of the ICT-based educational settings, taking into account a bilateral approach of the learner's system that involves both cognitive and emotional processes, as reflected in the Valence/Arousal space. Justification of the crucial role of learner's affective state in the design of an ICT-based educational setting is provided with the implications derived from an experimental case-study, referring to emotional responses to IADS-based sound stimuli presented to three age-dependent learner-groups. The proposed affective parameters define an enriched BT that could serve as a basis for structuring a new model, closer to the pragmatic nature of the learner's system.		Sofia J.

The system is motivated by a desire to expand the benefits of network connectivity deeply into rural areas, breaking down barriers within and between communities. Recognizing that large segments of the population in rural communities have low levels of literacy, CKS implements a multi-literate design in which the system can be customized based on the abilities and preferences of the user. Three research areas are explored. The primary research area is to understand whether multi-literate interfaces can expand access to technology. Second, the study explores concerns that users of the system have around security and trust. Third, the study identifies the types of information used and demanded by a sample user group. An evaluation of CKS has been conducted in Bohechio, an agricultural town in the Dominican Republic. Participants were drawn to cover a range of ages, educational backgrounds and literacy skill levels. With regards to multi-literacy and access, it is found that low literate users prefer iconic interfaces, speech synthesis is not effective, and literate users are willing to create text and audio content. On security and trust, the study finds that in the context of networked message systems rural people have different security requirements, and need to trust both the communications channel and content. Lastly, in discussions on information it is found that health, news, commercial and family information is in the greatest use and greatest demand in the community. CKS is a modest first step at developing an appropriate messaging environment for the developing world. Policy recommendations are drawn to inform future technology design and evaluation efforts. Developers of information technologies for use in the developing world should design iconic interfaces for low literate users, not rely on speech synthesis technologies, collaborate with communities, and balance cost, security and accessibility in their technology design. Evaluation of these technologies should take a longer-term approach in order to ensure that participants understand the application being tested.

In evaluating capabilities of the gifted students in computer, how students acquire skills on application software such as word processor and spreadsheet software has been considered an important factor. But, in order to evaluate the gifted students in computer accurately, various factors such as applicability, tenacity, initiativeness, curiosity must be considered. In this paper, we present a curriculum for the gifted elementary school students in computer. Our curriculum can be classified into three categories, Knowledge, Skill and Morality, respectively. Our proposed curriculum is designed by considering existing curricula for all elementary school students and various standards for computer contests.

The experience of facilitating virtual communities and teams (Eunice and Kimball in http://www.Tmn.com/~lisa/odn-teams.htm , 1997) suggests that groups go through the same stages either in face-to-face or in online mode. The paper brings together a theoretical framework based on the literature on virtual communities, Gestalt systems and online facilitation in order to address the issue of electronic togetherness, in particular from a group dynamics perspective. The empirical work on which the paper is based is an observation of a group of students in a training set playing a decision-making game. The model of Tuckman (Tuckman in Psychol Bull 63:384–399, 1965; Tuckman and Jensen in Group Organ Stud 2:419–427, 1977) is used as a framework within which to discuss the findings of the case.

27c0dafbaa4314420c27541c62a74ca515b24da2	building mathematics cellular phone learning communities		Researchers emphasize the importance of maintaining learning communities and environments. This article describes the building and nourishment of a learning community, one comprised of middle school students who learned mathematics out-of-class using the cellular phone. The building of the learning community was led by three third year pre-service teachers majoring in mathematics and computers. The pre-service teachers selected thirty 8th grade students to learn mathematics with the cellular phone and be part of a learning community experimenting with this learning. To analyze the building and development stages of the cellular phone learning community, two models of community building stages were used; first the team development model developed by Tuckman (1965), second the life cycle model of a virtual learning community developed by Garber (2004). The research findings indicate that a learning community which is centered on a new technology has five u0027lifeu0027 phases of development: Pre-birth, birth, formation, performing, and maturity. Further, the research finding indicate that the norms that were encouraged by the preservice teachers who initiated the cellular phone learning community resulted in a community which developed, nourished and matured to be similar to a community of experienced applied mathematicians who use mathematical formulae to study everyday phenomena.	mobile phone	Wajeeh M.

The author surveyed administrators at academic libraries serving baccalaureate, master’s, and research institutions and discovered that benefits available to academic librarians are not as generous as those available to faculty, and that tenured and tenure-track librarians fare better than counterparts who are not eligible for tenure.	email;fred (chatterbot);librarian;library (computing);sara (computer)	Ruth Sara Connell	2013	C&RL		library science;pedagogy	Metrics	-76.77146699016609	-26.760916973598377	145054

Despite the huge potential, there is no sufficient IT support for reflective learning in organizations. The aim of the paper is to identify crucial functionalities of applications to support reflective learning, as well as to closely align these functionalities with reflective learning theory. The existing functionalities of our prototype are mapped to the requirements derived from theory in four use cases. We observed that all the functionalities could be mapped to the theory and all requirements we derived from theory are addressed by the current implementation. This leads us to the conclusion that the identified functionalities are necessary in order to enable IT support of reflective learning in organizations. We present two evaluation streams from which we derived further improvement potentials.	align (company);experience;prototype;requirement	Thomas Kleinert;Tobias Dumont;Peter Fettke;Peter Loos	2014			computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;management science	HCI	-74.61958276589868	-37.41841811680479	145106

The field of studies is in constant and rapid development and because of that the characteristics of ‘the professional’ in the field of work are changing very fast. The School educates 60 students a year up to the level on which they can work, survive and keep up with the developments. 95 % of them develop a healthy career after graduation. The programme covers most of the field in various degrees and educate students up to MA and MPhil levels. The programme was developed over the last 17 years and is updated on a yearly basis. We have build in mechanisms to enforce regular updates of the programme and to develop the knowledge and skills of the teaching staff. This paper describes the programme, its design criteria and the updating procedures along with the vision on education on Music and Technology.

The Pisa surveys show disappointing results for Sweden, and the Swedish Committee for Digitisation has analyzed IT education in the school sector and developed concrete proposals to provide the Swedish government with a basis for future educational policy making. This development also has a great impact on how higher education will need to evolve. Technology, in many ways, changes the playing field for education and life long learning, and thus the pedagogy and leadership upon which our education is based also needs to change. This talk discusses the current view of education and life long learning and brings provocative ideas to the table concerning the future of ICT in Education.

The thoughts of 32 teachers and 36 students vis-à-vis a Course Management System from five undergraduate courses were analysed. A systematic content analysis was merged with a multivariate analysis. The results seem to reveal 4 profiles of teachers (i.e., activities-oriented, interaction-oriented, assessment-oriented, and collaboration-oriented) and 3 profiles of students (i.e., interactive learning environment-oriented, -oriented, training-oriented). A proficient LMS seems to require human resilience and versatile to the needs of all users. © 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The DynaLab t project in progress at Montana State University was presented as an example of of how a program animator can be used in labora tory experiments to teach t ime and space complexity. Work by John Stasko, Tom Naps, Marc Brown, and others on algori thm animat ion systems for i l luminating the inner workings of impor tan t algori thms in an interactive fashion was summarized. The concept animations (e.g., nondeterminist ic pushdown au toma ta ) of Susan Rodger were covered as well. A review of the CD version of the Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest Algorithms t ex tbook-comple te with interactive algori thm an ima t ions -was done. Most recently, the use of HTML, the World Wide Web, and Web browsers-such as Mosaic and Netscapc were promoted as combining to offer a very effective teaching and learning tool. In all of these discussions, some serious impediments to widespread use of these various systems was underscored: the program, algorithm, and concept animat ion systems only run on certain ha rdware /ope ra t ing system platforms, as do the programs behind the tex tbook versions of CDs tha t require special software to do the animations. Interactive, hyper text teaching aids developed in HTML for the Web, on the other hand, run on any computer with the proper Web-browsing software, but including animations currently requires tha t a process be run on the remote host computer; not only is this slow, but again, the animations can only be run if t h e local computer has compatible output facilities (e.g., X-windows). A melding of program, algorithm, and concept animations with the general accessibility offered by HTML and the World Wide Web would be ideal. So goes the reverie, anyway. The idea is tha t as a s tudent is s tudying a part icular topic in, say, algori thms by way of an HTML document , upon encountering a description of an open hashing algorithm, she could simply click on an animat ion link and watch an example of tha t hashing algori thm unfold as she directed various actions with clicks of the mouse. This would mean tha t the animat ion would need to run on her client computer in much the same way tha t an HTML document is downloaded and interpreted locally.	accessibility;algorithm;animat;client (computing);column (database);computer science;dspace;experiment;html;hash function;hash table;host (network);hypertext;java;linear algebra;microsoft windows;ncsa mosaic;os-tan;stack (abstract data type);tom;world wide web;x window system	Rocky Ross	1996	SIGACT News	10.1145/230514.571644	computer science;multimedia;world wide web	Theory	-68.95745341214496	-28.55748873217249	146069

The results from multiple experiments provided converging evidence for the conclusion that cardiopsychism is still very much alive in the minds of modern people. Aside from demonstrating the continued presence of cardiopsychism, we explored both the antecedent and consequence of holding this misconception. Through cross-cultural comparison, we found evidence suggesting that the conventionalized heart-expressions people speak might be responsible for perpetuating cardiopsychism. In addition, our hypothetical scenario study indicated that the perseverance of cardiopsychism might be more than just an innocuous glitch but could have real-world impacts.	experiment;glitch	Haotian Zhou;John T.

The study used a survey approach. The study was carried out in 2004. A total of 32 MLIS graduates (1996–2003) of the Department of Library and Information Studies in employment were surveyed. The sampling technique used to identify past graduates in employment was snowballing. The findings suggest that not all of the digital library skills are used and that the emergent information market, although still located in the traditional library or information unit, includes elements related to networks and distributed information systems. Most graduates feel that they have been adequately prepared for the market, although some feel that they would have been more prepared if the training had also been practical, as opposed to being theoretical.	digital library;emergence	Ayoku A.

Here we trace the development of the concept of “problem space” from its inception within the information-processing perspective as a characterization of individual problem-solving activity. We review reformulations and extensions made to the concept within the Learning Sciences, and explore them as attempts to better describe small-group interactions in complex knowledge-building contexts. Using a detailed analysis of sustained, online collaborative problem-solving activity, we propose that a new aspect of the problem space needs to be carefully considered in order to fully account for these kinds of experiences: temporal and sequential orientation to inter-subjective meaning making.	cognition;contingency (philosophy);embedded system;emergence;information processing;interaction;intersubjectivity;problem domain;problem solving	Johann W.

Two solutions using different strategies to address the critical area of support for technology implementers are examined, i.e., the online Stages of Concern about the Innovation Questionnaire (SoCQ) and TechConnect. The SoCQ tool assesses staff concerns about innovation use as a first step in identifying and developing appropriate assistance. Two applications of use of the SoCQ are described: preservice administrators using an online problem-based learning environment, and teachers implementing online curriculum. TechConnect, a World Wide Web site for sharing stories about technology use in educational environments, illustrates a mechanism for supporting change and technology use through creating a networked community of users. The development and use of these change tools at Planet Innovation is also described.

Without a shared base of knowledge (common ground), discourse itself is impossible, let alone collaborative interaction. Collaborators must share a means of communication (language), a joint focus (object-orientation), and a compatible orientation (perspective). In addition to being dependent upon the presence of existing shared knowledge, successful collaboration or collaborative learning involves the construction of new knowledge, created jointly and thereby shared by the participants. Knowledge can take many forms, not necessarily rational, propositional, explicit, factual knowledge. There is tacit and explicit knowledge, focal and background, propositional and procedural, personal and institutional, individual and group.	focal (programming language)	Gerry Stahl;Friedrich W.

In the field of business, academia or politics, the demand for supporting decision making based on data has been increased. Ohsawa et al. propose the concept of the market of data (MoDAT) for the demand, and provide Innovators Marketplace on Data Jackets (IMDJ) as a method for realizing MoDAT, which is a workshop method for encouraging particippants to utilize and exchange data. However, although participants of the workshop discuss the given theme each other, possible combinations of DJs for satisfying requirements are hardly generated. That is one of the problems of IMDJ. In this paper, in order to solve the problem, we propose the visualization method for representing the similarities between DJs using latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS) in order to aid users metacognition in IMDJ. The result shows that our proposed method improve the performance of participants to create feasible solutions by combining DJs. c © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Most studies have underlined that triggering productive collaborative learning in wikis may be challenging and that an effective learning design is an important prerequisite for their successful exploitation. Several related design guidelines have been proposed such as setting group goals, design a rich context and problem, motivating progress monitoring, establishing structured collaboration processes etc. By following these guidelines and taking advantage of community of learners principles, we have designed the instructional approach WEKI which aims to help students to familiarize with a new learning domain by co-developing an open educational book about the domain. Twenty-four 4th-year undergraduate students of an Electrical and Computer Engineering Department applied the WEKI approach and formed a learning community for 15 weeks. The undergraduates successfully managed to design and develop an e-book and relevant learning resources about Microsoft Kodu in the context of a Teaching IT course. Interviews about students’ perceptions of WEKI were conducted with all of the students before and after the project. In the beginning, students considered the proposed framework as a complicated and challenging process but in the end, the vast majority of students stated that their experience and the final products exceeded their best expectations. Our results indicate that well-structured instructional approaches focusing on communities of learners’ principles, may realize the potential of wikis.	wiki	George Palaigeorgiou;Ioannis Kazanidis	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-52836-6_49	knowledge management;learning community;affordance;blended learning;communication;mediation (marxist theory and media studies);computer science;collaborative learning	ML	-76.02057788466973	-37.980796351979585	148834

As many migrants have smartphones, they can be used for integration purposes. In this study, mobile applications (apps) for Swedish language training, information about host society and contacts with locals targeted at newly arrived Arabic migrants are analysed. With focus on language and cultural training we developed a model for evaluation that takes into account both Technological, Pedagogical, Linguistic and Cultural aspects. The TPLC-model for evaluation shows that language training as well as translation and vocabulary apps dominate the Swedish market, while societal information is largely absent. Most of the analysed apps are technically reliable, free of charge and available for Android or both Android and iOS. However, in regard to the pedagogical aspects, the apps demonstrate a focus on traditional pedagogical approaches with basic vocabulary training and similar, while more active learning and pronunciation and speaking activities are less common. The latter can, together with expansion of intercultural communication, be areas for further development in mobile learning for integration purposes.	android;mobile app;smartphone;vocabulary;ios	Sylvana Sofkova Hashemi;Nataliya Berbyuk Lindström;Lorna Bartram;Linda Bradley	2017		10.1145/3136907.3136930	active learning;intercultural communication;multimedia;android (operating system);mobile technology;pedagogy;acquiring language;pronunciation;vocabulary;on language;engineering	Web+IR	-69.5957656969186	-31.18252121592912	149172

Students need broader skills than the 3Rs (reading, writing and arithmetic) to operate in the 21st century. These broader skills known as the 4Cs include: creativity, communication, collaboration and critical thinking. The use of information and communication technologies is crucial in developing the 4Cs in conjunction with understanding how learning takes place. However, simply using technology does not guarantee that deep learning will occur. The use of technology needs to align and adapt with our knowledge of learning to be able to operate in a transformative space. This paper is designed to link the understandings of deep learning, 21st century skills and appropriate use of information and communication technologies to provide direction to educators who wish to lead in a technological environment of change.	align (company);deep learning	Therese Keane;William F.

9433abbe561f6aaa96a81d134fec2c3ea495745e	how the feup removal to the new premises was facilitated by the internal information system	artigo em livro de atas de conferencia internacional;information system	Since 1996 that FEUP possesses an information system (SiFEUP) that was developed mainly to record the information on the school’s activity concerning teaching and learning, research and development as well as for school management. The system has been built in-house and has nowadays more than 30 integrated modules that are enabling the modernization of many processes and services providing simultaneously decision support facilities. In this work we will show how this system was a key tool to organise the logistics of the Faculty removal to new premises, namely its importance for minimizing the impact on the users resulting from the change to completely new infrastructures. 1 Presentation of the Engineering Faculty and its environment Descending from the Polytechnic Academy, created in 1837, the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP) is presently a prestigious public institution concerning the teaching and research of Engineering. The Engineering Faculty is the biggest of all the faculties that belong to the Porto University. It has almost six thousand students, four hundred professors, more than a half with a PhD, and two hundred staff. The University of Porto, is itself the biggest in Portugal, with approximately 25 000 students. FEUP presents a departmental structure, composed of six areas, Civil Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computers, Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Management, Mining Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering and Materials. To support the activities of these departments and of the Faculty as a whole there are several central services, including the Computer Centre, the Library, the Academic and Staff, the Economic and Financial, the Continuous Education and Development, the Public Relations and Image and the Technical and Maintenance Support services. FEUP offers eight undergraduate courses, 23 MSc degree courses and 8 areas for PhD studies, as well as other specialized post-graduate courses. Besides teaching the FEUP is currently involved in more than a hundred research projects, many of these on an international basis and in co-operation with industry. Since the year 1937 until September 2000, the Engineering Faculty occupied a location in the centre of the Porto city, with around 30 000 m, where several adapted buildings housed the departments, services and R&D institutes. Figure 1. SiFEUP: information about the Faculty map On September 2000, the Faculty moved to a new location, in the city periphery. This new location almost triplicates the available area. The different departments and services occupy 12 main buildings, as shown in Figure 1. The covered area is now about 90.000 m, where lecture rooms and offices occupy each 17.000 m and laboratories 41.300 m. This was probably the biggest and most complex move that occurred in town for many years. One of the many aspects of the move that has been particularly demanding was the maintenance of the users connectivity to the network and computing services. Since 1988 the Engineering Faculty possesses a local data network. It has been built as a shared 10Mbps Ethernet network and upgraded to a switched 10Mbps Ethernet technology in 1995. Just before the removal to the new premises the number of nodes connected to this infrastructure was around 2 500. In the new location, the local area network is a completely different infrastructure incorporating ATM OC-12/OC-3 technology, respectively in the core and in the backbone, and offering switched 100BASE-TX to the users, at the access level. If necessary, it can also offer ATM to designated users. The number of active access points is this infrastructure is 6000 and about 3500 nodes are presently connected. These nodes comprise central clusters of UNIX/Linux and NT servers, plus several departmental NT and Linux servers, and more than 500 microcomputers in 30 general computer labs. The library has also about 100 desktop computers for the students and many others are available at the departmental laboratories. The ratio student/computer is better than 5. The FEUP LAN, that we call FEUPNet, is connected to the national scientific communication network (RCTS) by a 2Mbps link. The Faculty always promoted the use of the computing environment. All the students are allowed to use the network and computing resources since the first year of their undergraduate programmes. They also have full access to the Internet, as well as all the other elements of the academic community. Almost every professor, technician or administrative staffs has a personal computer connected to the FEUPNet. FEUP offers teleworking facilities and presently near 2000 students and staff use traditional analogue telephone lines and ISDN to connect to the FEUP Access Server and access the resources available to do remote work. As the network and its computing and information resources are used on a daily basis, it was necessary to guarantee the users connectivity to the main services during the removal period and no more than a 24h interruption was acceptable. Because the removal of the Faculty was scheduled to occur in less than two months, the connectivity to the network and access to the servers should be available to the users that were already at the new premises as well as to the users that were waiting to move, at the old buildings. We will show in this work that the internal Information System (SiFEUP) has been a key factor to make the removal of the whole Faculty feasible in an especially short interval. It helped on minimizing the impact on the users and permitted the new academic year to start normally, with just two weeks of delay. The initiative of creating an integrated campus wide information system belonged to the faculty direction board, in 1996 [1]. Its strong commitment with the project was essential to make it possible, as the different departments and R&D units within FEUP have large freedom in managing their resources and thus a high level influence is necessary to push towards the development of such a system. The main goal of the SiFEUP has been to enable faster access and dissemination of scholar, scientific, technical and other info-resources, stimulating a stronger collaboration among members of our academic community. A second, but equally important goal, has been the possibility to increase the connection and the interaction with other higher education institutions and with industries, especially in the northern region of Portugal. Before the removal, the information system already included about 30 modules covering aspects ranging from the school infrastructures and the academic and staff records, to the course plans, scientific productivity or the external assessment processes [2, 3]. 2 Planning the removal	atm turbo;academy;computer cluster;computer engineering;computer lab;decision support system;desktop computer;electrical engineering;general computer corporation;high-level programming language;information system;integrated services digital network;internet backbone;interrupt;linux;logistics;microcomputer;modular programming;network access server;personal computer;schedule;scheduling (computing);scientific communication;telecommunications network;telecommuting;telephone line;unix;windows nt 4.0;wireless access point	Lígia M.

However, little effort has been put on understanding cultural and contextual differences in pedagogy of programming. Pedagogical literature shows that educational design should account for differences in the ways of learning and teaching between industrialized and developing countries. However, the nature and implications of those differences are hitherto unclear. Using group interviews and quantitative surveys, we identified several crucial elements for contextualizing programming education.

The Visual Book study (Landoni, 1997) explored the importance of the visual component of the book metaphor for the production of more effective electronic books, while the WEB Book study (Wilson, 1999) took the findings of the Visual Book and applied them to the production of books for publication on the WWW. It was possible to extract from the two experiences a set of recommendations for producing electronic books. These are the starting point for a new project, EBONI (Electronic Books ON-screen Interface). EBONI focuses on the evaluation of electronic resources for teaching and learning in academia and it is going to expand our previous findings with the aim of producing a set of guidelines for publishing educational material on the Web.	book;e-book;www;world wide web	Monica Landoni;Ruth Wilson;Forbes Gibb	2001	Online Information Review	10.1108/14684520110395227	questionnaire;design;usability;computer science;database;publishing;multimedia;sociology;electronic publishing;higher education;law;world wide web	HCI	-72.8840367088758	-24.265743384332122	150548

The Department of Entertainment Technology, under the leadership of Zuanda Badenhorst, conducted a very exciting project with the Handspring Puppet Company while also making use of the newest learning technologies made available by the Department of Telematic Education, with Instructional Designer Mandi Axmann and Technical Manager Anette Sadie, at the Technikon Pretoria. This article reviews the educational use of videoconferencing as well as various considerations when implementing this medium Overview of the project The learners from Entertainment Technology as well as the Drama Department had the opportunity to follow the back-stage production work by the Handspring Puppet Company on a new piece entitled “Zeno at 4pm”. The aim of the project was twofold: to introduce learners to the planning and performance of a real-life production in puppetry, and to expose the learners to videoconferencing technology. The project started off with a videoconference during January 2001 hosted by the Department of Telematic Education with the puppeteers from the Handspring Puppet Company in Cape Town, South Africa during March 2001. During the videoconference the puppeteers illustrated the making of the puppets and their planning for their production. During the second stage of the project the learners had an opportunity to see a final dress rehearsal of the production in Johannesburg, South Africa, and were able to ask questions regarding the stage set-up, lighting techniques, production costs and planning for the opening night in Brussels. These responses were video taped and were made available to the learners. 05_Baden 31/5/2002 5:31 pm Page 291	real life;sockpuppet (internet);telematics	Zuanda Badenhorst;Mandi Axmann	2002	BJET	10.1111/1467-8535.00264	psychology;educational technology;social science;simulation;puppetry;computer science;evaluation;feedback;multimedia;sociology;videoconferencing;management;pedagogy	HCI	-77.30573761039163	-33.490008256754976	150936

E-Learning system has also gained a competitive edge over the prevailing traditional methodology. The prevailing pedagogy is being replaced by the E-Learning teaching system. E-Learning teaching-learning methodology provides more flexibility and allows freedom from time, place, physical presence, hectic, and stressful teaching-learning etc., thus plays a vital role in education system. However, there are many barriers in E-Learning methodology for successful teaching-learning. Study on such barriers will help to overcome the difficulties to the success of E-Learning. Present research paper attempts to study the various barriers that are affecting the successful implementation of E-Learning in Saudi Arabian Universities. This study reviews various barriers from literatures and identified most important E-Learning barriers which are described and grouped in four dimensions such as Student, Instructor, Infrastructure and Technology, and Institutional Management. Sixteen barriers falling under these relevant dimensions were validated their importance quantitatively through university Students, Instructors, and E-Learning staffs of some well know universities in Saudi Arabia. A survey instrument was developed and tested on a sample of 257 respondents of Saudi Arabian Universities. It was found that Infrastructure and Technology Dimension is the most significant as perceived by respondents. Results of the study also reveal that, all barrier factors are highly reliable, therefore should be taken care for successful implementation of E-Learning systems.

The roots of this exploration lie in my personal, functional, social and cultural experiences, and cross-cultural encounters. These encounters in many ways reflect the networking journey of AI & Society, promoting and stimulating the human-centred debate in cross-cultural settings. As a ‘cross-cultural holon’, AI & Society has been questioning the given orthodoxy of the ‘one best way’ and the culture of the ‘exact language’ since its inception 21 years ago. My observation is that even though we now live in a world of multimodal interactive media technologies, some how the interface design has not moved much beyond the functional (observed reality) worldview of our interactions. Even at the functional level, the design perspective remains bounded by the observed reality. It is thus no surprise that when it comes to designing interaction technologies for social and cultural domains such as health care, work, employment, life long learning, the design mainly hovers around the functional skill training, mechanical feedback and objectified evaluation. When we move beyond the functional worldview, and explore our interactions within social and cultural domains, we encounter both the reality (objectified world) and actuality (experienced world) of interactions. At this level, the challenge of the interface is not just coping with the interaction spaces of reality and actuality but also with the ‘in-between’ space of actuality–reality gaps. We explore how the concept of symbiosis enables the interaction in the gaps between actuality and reality, how the concept of the ‘culture of the artificial enables the sharing and pooling experiences, how the concept of valorisation’ enables to find a coherence (commonality) between interactions, and how the concept of cultural holon is used to conceptualise the network architecture of cross-cultural interactions. It is proposed that the way forward to designing cross-cultural interfaces is to first seek a conceptual framework for cross-cultural interaction spaces, and then use this framework to design interfacing systems and tools.	ai & society;experience;holon (philosophy);interactive media;multimodal interaction;network architecture	Karamjit S.

The notion of ubiquity will likely extend to more comprehensive ubiquitous service, as demand grows for the ability to access desired services at any time and at any place. However, these are hardly new notions, and are discussed in relation to visionary proposals put forward in the 1960s. The etymology of ubiquity derives from a metaphysical premise of the spatial and temporal omnipresence of the divine, and the notion extends through traditional religious thought far back into prehistoric belief. While ubiquity is clearly a highly desirable notion, it bears the danger of becoming an overly indulgent wish fulfillment, where all human needs and desires demand immediate satisfaction. Clearly, this represents an unhealthy extension of the idea. What is called for instead I term wisdom ubiquity: the wise provisioning of ubiquitous services, which within realistic parameters accommodate an appropriate level of human satisfaction.	provisioning;ubiquitous computing;wish list	Robert C.

A local educational partnership set up a student digital leader project late in 2011, which aimed to develop a range of skills and outcomes for both the digital leaders themselves and for a potentially wider variety of personnel within the schools. Five schools were involved in the project. The student digital leaders shared their digital technology expertise with others with less developed skills, including teachers and managers in these schools. The study reported in this paper explored ways that the digital leader initiative was implemented, identifying and analysing outcomes and issues arising. Evidence from informants and from the analysis of benefits arising indicates that the student digital leader initiative led to a variety of positive outcomes. A key finding and conclusion is that this form of initiative has involved some students who tend not to be involved in other leadership or school-wide activities. The initiative enables these students to contribute to the community, rather than just receiving from it; students become active contributors to, as well as receivers from, the educational system.	digital electronics	Don Passey	2014	Education and Information Technologies	10.1007/s10639-014-9322-z	simulation;program evaluation;knowledge management;mathematics;technology education;management;pedagogy	HCI	-76.45555912443075	-34.69977727644547	152285

Ethnographic fieldwork was carried out over a ten day period, consisting of observational studies and informal interviews. They are a small, inter-disciplinary group who are highly mobile and work in a hazardous, critical environment where mistakes can pose risk to health, safety and the environment as well as significant financial loss. Two main shift roles, field operator and central control room operator, are discussed and related to the wider workplace. Even in this technologically-advanced workplace, non-digital informational artifacts are important, often serving as bridges to support flowing activity between communities of practice and the physical and digital. Spending time in the physical plant was seen as an important way to develop an understanding of the process and to gain insight not available through a control system. The primary contribution of this paper is the detailing and discussion of an oil and gas workplace from a CSCW perspective, a context not well established in the literature, yet one that poses an interesting range of design challenges.	canonical quantization;computer-supported cooperative work;control system;field research;physical plant;virtual artifact	Clint Heyer	2009			simulation;human–computer interaction;communication;management	HCI	-64.72642282008445	-35.546330049351496	152371

A random sample of 1,200 books was taken from a Master's-degree awarding university library in the United States. In this study, 400 titles from the library's general collection were compared to 400 Spanish-language titles. Levels of accessibility for each title in the four MDLs were recorded, ranging from no record, record only, partial view, to full-view. Results showed little difference in accessibility between Spanish and English books in Google Books (7% Spanish fully accessible vs. 8% English). However, differences in accessibility were found in the Internet Archive (2% vs. 8%), HathiTrust (6% vs.11%), and Open Library (5% vs. 16%). Issues related to accessibility and non-English collections in MDLs are also addressed.	accessibility;archive;book;digital library;hathitrust	Andrew Philip Weiss;Ryan James	2013	2013 International Conference on Culture and Computing	10.1109/CultureComputing.2013.10	library science;engineering;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-72.67109057548682	-25.366440390391215	152709

They have found many uses in commerce and industry as well as for education and enlightenment. They are so inexpensive that it is possible in some firms to put one on everybody's desk. The computers are truly personal.  Personal stand-alone computers are fine for doing independent individual work. When it comes to sharing the work of others, we need an integrated system. Information created by one person should be easily available to any other person. This is a common policy in education, commerce, industry and engineering where the medium of exchange is the mainframe. Terminals allow users access to large quantities of information, as long as they are privileged to do so.	enlightenment;mainframe computer;microcomputer;quantities of information	Ivan Flores	1983		10.1145/800173.809716	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia	DB	-66.68022012047463	-24.476271085370023	153124

It starts by briefly describing the theoretical and empirical foundations of this approach, formalized into three key notions of place/space, action and mediation. In the light of these notions, some common assumptions about presence are then questioned: assuming a neat distinction between virtual and real environments, taking for granted the contours of the mediated environment and considering presence as a purely personal state. Some possible research topics opened up by adopting action as a unit of analysis are illustrated. Finally, a case study on driving as a form of mediated presence is discussed, to provocatively illustrate the flexibility of this approach as a unified framework for presence in digital and physical environments.	intersubjectivity;mediation (statistics);unified framework;virtual reality	Luciano Gamberini;Anna Spagnolli	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-10190-3_6	management science;affordance;mediation (marxist theory and media studies);unit of analysis;mathematics;hybridity	AI	-64.31053636704127	-31.186572598103556	153744

Soon after, SRCE become present on Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn and foursquare. Maintaining the presence and communication on social networks was initially one of the activities carried out by the SRCE Helpdesk service. However, as a result of the growing workload and responsibilities of the Helpdesk, a new service was established only for activities related to social networks. This paper discuses the communication strategy used by SRCE on social networks. The authors examined different web based tools and services to gather information about Internet users who follow SRCE's activities on different social network. A data analysis shows that the initial goals SRCE set in 2009 related to its communication strategy on social networks have been fulfilled. This data will also be used as a starting point for reconsideration of the existing communication strategy. With the emergence of new popular social networks there might be a need for expansion.	emergence;google+;internet;social network	Kruno Golubic;Gorana Kurtovic;Natasa Dobrenic	2013	Proceedings of the ITI 2013 35th International Conference on Information Technology Interfaces	10.2498/iti.2013.0555	the internet;computer science;internet privacy;data analysis;law;world wide web;statistics	Metrics	-74.09080041042564	-26.819987001141723	153935

Our panelists and our participants together will engage in exploring, defining and theorizing diverse research spaces of mediating connections through materiality. The panel is a discursive arena where participants embedded in different communities engage in material practices. In this session the panelists and participants will walk through the process of mediating connections through materiality in real time. The session is intended to be about the process—the means to an end, not an end in itself: shifting boundaries, identifying connections, moving margins and creating a participatory practice that embodies the very connections we hope to enact. Together we are moving from {apart from} to {a part of} – thus our practice reflects what we have experienced in our respective projects, facilitating in a material way the practice of boundary-spanning.

We illustrate the dual use of responsiveness and framing through the case study of Mrs. Charles, who skillfully elicits and builds on students' ideas in her science classroom. In our analysis, we found that ranking the extent of this teacher's responsiveness was inadequate for describing the nature of her teaching and for uncovering ways in which this teacher might progress. Analyzing Mrs. Charles's practice in terms of her framing of the situation, however, began to reveal patterns and nuances in the nature of her responsiveness. We argue that it is through the overlay of her epistemological framing onto an analysis of her responsiveness that we get a fuller picture of Mrs. Charles's practice: inviting and valuing students' contributions while encouraging exploration of certain ideas over others.	framing (world wide web);responsiveness	April Cordero Maskiewicz;Victoria Winters	2010			psychology;social science;social psychology;pedagogy	HCI	-64.24749088445094	-33.64179125331529	154044

Educational institutions such as universities, whose main objective is to educate students to gain more knowledge and skills for their careers as well as how to adapt and live in their community. Over the past decades, teaching and learning paradigms have rapidly changed from traditional styles to computer-based styles. Electronic learning (e-learning) has been recognized as an effective computer-based technology for knowledge management, life long learning, and distant learning. Although most universities have created electronic alumni networks and systems, those systems lack the concern of knowledge management. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an electronic learning system for integrating knowledge management and alumni systems.	knowledge management	Amnart Pohthong;Panumporn Trakooldit	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-36981-0_2	knowledge management;business;lifelong learning	AI	-75.51409578650689	-34.4046531241281	154052

The study focuses on differences between notetaking with a pen and paper or with a laptop and identifies the reasons for preferring the one or the other. Our findings show that notetaking systems should allow handwritten input, as notes on paper are preferred by the majority of students, mainly because they allow unconstrained free-form handwriting and sketches. Moreover, this paper examines context factors which influence notetaking. For this purpose, a context model for notetaking is presented, which distinguishes the four context types of learner, instructor, content and setting. We identified a significant influence of several specific context aspects and therefore conclude that notetaking systems must be adaptable in order to support notetaking in different contexts effectively.	laptop	Jürgen Steimle;Iryna Gurevych;Max Mühlhäuser	2007			computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-74.47374505074238	-37.26627580753129	154098

Live visuals have been used to fill in this gap. However, there is a scarcity of studies that analyze the effectiveness of live visuals in conveying feedback. In this paper, we aim to study the contribution of live visuals to the understanding of electronic music performances, from the perspective of the audience. We present related work in the fields of audience studies in performing arts, electronic music and audiovisuals. For this purpose, we organized two live events, where 10 audiovisual performances took place. We used questionnaires to conduct an audience study in these events. Results point to a better audience understanding in two of the four design patterns we used as analytical framework. In our discussion, we suggest best practices for the design of audiovisual performance systems that can lead to improved audience understanding.	best practice;design pattern;feedback;performance	Nuno N.

It may be incremental, radical, or revolutionary changes in thinking, products, processes, or organizations. Different from invention, which is an idea made manifest, innovation is ideas applied successfully. In this work, we strive to apply innovative Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems to special education school campus because in this modern age of science and technology, there still exists a wide digital gap in special education schools such that they have not yet benefited from technology advancements such as RFID. Supported by the ministry of education in Taiwan, we successfully designed and deployed RFID technology to the campus of a special education school at Chiayi in Taiwan. Though the technology was applied to eight different use case scenarios, we will focus on five of the more innovative ones in this work, including student temperature monitoring (STM), body weight monitoring (BWM), garbage disposal monitoring (GDM), mopping course recording (MCR), and campus visitor monitoring (CVM). Both active and passive tags and readers were employed to implement these five systems within the same campus. The benefits obtained from these systems by the students, teachers, and administrators were three-folds. First, student health monitoring through STM and BWM systems allowed the teachers and administration real-time control over changing health conditions that significantly affects such students. Second, course monitoring and recording through GDM and MCR allowed teachers to easily grasp and tune the learning curve of each student and also to implement a more guided training based on past learning efforts. Last but not least, campus safety monitoring through CVM allowed the administration to monitor the location of visitors in the campus and thus safeguard the students and teachers from dangerous or troublesome visitors. Novel techniques and creative methods were employed in the five systems, including temperature correction algorithm in STM, BMI-based weight tuning strategy in BWM, multiple route-tracking in GDM, learning improvement through history analysis in MCR, and face detection in CVM. The project was successfully deployed and is currently in use by the Chiayi School of Special Education which has more than 300 students and 150 administration staff and faculty.	algorithm;brain–computer interface;face detection;gps tracking unit;human body weight;memory card reader;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;real-time transcription;software transactional memory	Shu-Hui Yang;Pao-Ann Hsiung	2010	2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage	10.1109/NAS.2010.33	radio-frequency identification;simulation;special education;telecommunications;computer science;multimedia;computer security	Visualization	-71.08295447351304	-31.955383073224485	154708

This essay will examine the ontological interplay of textual dualist norms in the Russian and Soviet states of the 19th and early 20th centuries and how those norms were challenged by augmented claims embodied in rumors, refrains, and the spelling of names. By utilizing the informational concepts of mobility and asynchronicity, three Russian historical vignettes—the Emancipation of the Serfs in 1861, the documentation of Jews in Imperial Russia, and the attempts by Trotsky to realize Soviet symchka—demonstrate that not only are dualist discourses prevalent in periods outside of the contemporary, but also that the way in which those conflicts framed themselves in the past directly influences their deployment in today’s digital world.	augmented reality;digital electronics;documentation;software deployment	Jeremy Antley	2012	Future Internet	10.3390/fi4041037	augmented reality;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;management;law	HCI	-63.33903715637368	-30.563474738199066	154861

Traditionally, such syllabi were distributed in paper form, although distribution now may include e-mail or course web pages.	document;email;level of detail;web page	Henry MacKay Walker	2005	SIGCSE Bulletin	10.1145/1113847.1113859	computer science;level of detail;syllabus;web page;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-72.20191267690471	-27.158045978517364	154912

The project was initially divided into two phases---Phase 1 to deploy an IMAP server for campuswide use and Phase 2 to identify and provide a reliable, high quality, enterprise-wide IMAP client. A sub-group of the IMAP project team was formed to identify requirements and evaluate clients. Cyrusoft International's Mulberry was found to meet the ever changing requirements of the campus computing labs and have sufficient features and functionality that users would be compelled to switch from their legacy clients to the new environment. A critical third phase was added to the IMAP project which required a phase-out of the legacy e-mail systems by April 1, 2000 and the provision of a standard graphical client-server e-mail system for both the Macintosh and Windows platforms to all students, faculty and staff. The presentation will describe the third and final phase of the project in detail, discuss the issues surrounding how legacy e-mail users were kept informed, trained and migrated to new IMAP client. The presenters will identify the obstacles as we approached the deadline for full conversion to the IMAP protocol and the phase-out of all other e-mail systems on the University of Pittsburgh campus. Extensive use of user logs, forwarding data and distribution was critical to the process. The final phase involved the migration of 25,000 users from VMS Mail, Unix Pine and POP mail to the new environment by April 1, 2000.	client–server model;display resolution;email;graphical user interface;microsoft windows;requirement;server (computing);unix	Jay Graham	2000		10.1145/354908.354928	computer science;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web	OS	-69.01837539042873	-25.847165832145038	155013

Incorporating layers of deep reflection in exchange for surface learning approaches to common practices and everyday events in the life of school leaders amounts to a challenge against the status quo of leadership tradition. This paper presents a description of the rationale and developmental stages of the Global Forum on School Leadership. Conceived as an extension to the existing reflective and dialogic practices of a pre-service leader preparation program in the mid-west of the United States, the forum attempts to incorporate die perspectives of global colleagues on issues related to everyday practices and school leadership conundrums in a mediated, asynchronous, web-based discussion format. This project adds a needed global orientation to leadership preparation in a post September 11th international context.	interactivity	Ian W.

It has been developed in-house at LSE through inter-departmental collaboration. There were three principal aims for the project: to meet increasing technological expectation of customers; to increase efficiency in data entry, transfer and manipulation, and to improve the accuracy and timeliness of centrally held information. We launched LFY in November 2000 internally and to the world in May 2001 via the school's website. LFY has changed the way that LSE delivers some of its core administrative student services.At LSE, students can now use LFY to access (and where appropriate alter) much of central administration data, from their addresses to exam results, and staff can view useful information like photographs of their students or their own payslips online. We have also included internal administrative functions such as room booking and reprographics' requests, which cuts down internal paper-use and staff time.LFY also reaches out to both applicants and alumni. Applicants can check the progress of their application online, reducing telephone requests for routine information. LFY works as a communication tool between the School and our alumni and is used to help alumni keep the school informed of their current employment, with obvious fundraising benefits for the school.This paper will discuss what LFY does, both at the user level and for the school as a whole, and will include a brief technical description of how that is achieved. LFY has become an important part of thinking for the future at LSE, impacting upon customer interaction, ongoing ICT development, and ways of working. We want to push forward in our commitment to web-based ways of manipulating central data in order to facilitate new and better staff and customer relations.	customer relationship management;web application;world wide web	Katherine Forbes-Pitt	2002		10.1145/588646.588653	public relations;engineering;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-68.64552132464517	-24.412824131782436	155261
ffe107f4348df1028516a7a00d1c41dadbec9583	exploring cultural symbols in nigeria for contemporary applications in web visual design		The study aimed at exploring rich heritage of cultural symbols in Nigeria for meaningful and harmonious adaptations in web visual interface design. In this study, we focused on developing theme design for computer-based questionnaire form using selected cultural motifs from the Yoruba traditional textile tradition as a source of inspiration. Visual aesthetic evaluations were done by university students in south western Nigeria using semantic differential scales. We assessed the perceived aesthetic impression of the stimuli set through the main test procedure. The study reveals how the inflection and transfiguration of cultural symbols in web visual design can be visually appealing to the local computer users at a first glance and changes that might occur over extended exposure time. This paper underscores the relevance of cultural potentials from Nigerian heritage for modern day design application by using information technology as a platform towards adapting them.

80c9772c610dfe7d18b983f50db7c680830ab9ee	digital games-based learning for children with dyslexia: a social constructivist perspective on engagement and learning during group game-play		Taking a process-orientated, social constructivist lens, we examine the case of a digital game called Words Matter. The game was designed for children with dyslexia and was informed by principles from casual games and evidence-based practice from special education. Focusing on the game play of two groups of children, we employ a systematic thematic analytic approach on videos of children’s verbal and non-verbal interaction triangulated with their game logs, concentrating on the nature of student-student as well as student-tutor social interactions. Our findings show that children spontaneously engage in ‘game talk’ regarding game performance, content, actions and experiences. While this game talk facilitates a strong sense of social engagement and playfulness, it also caters to a variety of new opportunities for learning by sparking tutor and student-initiated interventions. Alongside its social theoretical lens on digital games-based learning, the paper analyses game-based social interactions in tandem with game design decisions enabling additional implications to be drawn for practice and game design.

We do so by analysing our experiences designing a diverse array of learning media for a large scale, distance learning course in introductory computing. During the project, we had to significantly rethink the design and production of our learning resources as we shifted from a paper-based teaching model to an interactive teaching model. This shift entailed changes to our design products (to promote more effective media use by learners) and changes to our design practices (to foster consistent media use and design across a large and distributed team). Course designers and course students alike needed help in breaking out of paper-based models of learning to obtain maximum benefit from the interactive teaching model.	experience;internet;new media	Tamara Sumner;Josie Taylor	1998		10.1145/274644.274703	distance education;cooperative learning;educational technology;team learning;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;experiential learning;learning sciences;teaching and learning center;multimedia;active learning;open learning;synchronous learning	HCI	-75.96122494124221	-37.796704817542846	155839
dc98de21da234c01880d2447a8680c2093e62f7c	the quest for sustainable smart grids		The authors have discussed in [1] the need for a transdiscipl inary science to electric grids. This letter aims at contributing to their view by commenting the so-call ed sustainable smart grids. Let us first define what we mean by sustainable. To be fair across its diverse definitions [2], we borrow the Oxford dictionary meaning: “able to be maintained at a ce rtain rate or level”. In this sense, we understand that the electric power grids should be sustaina ble over time and space in terms of not only technological aspects but also in other equally important d imensions such as social, economical, cultural and environmental. This has been partly touched by [1]. However, how should one d efine the dimensions of this analysis without skipping from the real world operation? Our answer a lso comes from complexity science: we believe that technological, social, economical, cultural and environmental processes co-evolve, shaping each other in time and space. In other words, the (perceived) states of the system at a given time, locally and globally, are emerging properties of dialectical relat ions between the involved processes. The challenge is to develop theoretic models to characterize them in diffe rent contexts. From this perspective, technological sciences urge new way s of looking at problems; transdisciplinary understanding needs to be built. For example, engineers nee d to be aware of analytical sociology [3] to assess social processes and their underlying mechanisms. T hey also need to see why economic sciences have historically failed to prevent big crises and why new th eories are then needed [4]. We could go on with other disciplines, but we prefer to turn th e attention to the most important aspect of any scientific theory:validation. As clearly stated in [5]: “Math can be seductive(...) But wh en the maths claims to be a model of real world, beauty can mislead”. Therefore, a scientific theory must be tested against real-world data to be valid (or not), otherwi se it can be classified as “not even wrong”. Agent-based simulations, in combination with real data, ar e sometimes worth to validate theories [2]–[4].	agent-based model;complex systems;dictionary;emergence;noise shaping;simulation;theory	Pedro Henrique Juliano Nardelli;Carlos A.

64441103ad0e6410bc2dbe01644c70d9b8da3461	the development of syllabus--an interactive, constraint-based scheduler for schools and colleges	constraint-based scheduler	In most schools and colleges, producing a timetable is a task that is dreaded by those charged with annually creating it. In schools in particular , it can be difficult to produce any solution at all because teaching resources are usually stretched to the limit. This situation is made more difficult by the fact that the person making up the timetable must not only produce a valid solution but one that is of good quality. A large number of judgmental factors are involved in producing a good-quality timetable. Some of these are educational (for example, it is undesirable for a group of pupils to have a Spanish lesson immediately following a German one), others pertain to the work conditions of the staff (for example, the teaching load should be distributed evenly through the day so that no teacher has a long, contiguous block of lessons), and others are political (for example, a senior teacher should not end up with fewer free periods than a more junior one). These qualitative factors make an already difficult problem time consuming indeed.

Without realising the functional use of such systems or considering the involvement of their dynamic users, these systems would probably become obsolete. This study includes both qualitative and quantitative research methods for the investigation of prospective teachers’ views on the operational aspects of such tools. The participants in this study were 75 prospective teachers that were participating in the graduate certification programme for secondary school subject teachers at Baskent University in Turkey. To realise the objectives of this study, prospective teachers were required to use the 17 of the existing LORs in their course. Analysis was also conducted on those LORs identified by the researchers. Afterwards, teachers were asked to answer an open-ended question in paper and pencil form.Through qualitative analysis, the responses of teachers were coded and presented in a table. The results of this analysis revealed many interesting points regarding teachers’ thoughts on the main factors in repositories and are expected to guide the designers, developers and users of LORs to focus on the main issues related to the improvement of functionality and efficiency of such systems.

Introduction Because of the copious developments and improvements in the Internet and Web technologies during the first decade of this century, the number of people providing data and resources to the content of the Web has hugely increased, resulting in vast amount of related yet disconnected information. Consequently, certain issues have appeared in many subject areas, such as education. Currently, the use of the Web has widened with the help of sharing platforms, as they provide facilities to their users in order to access educational materials and learning resources. While existing resources in terms of education are not organised or interconnected according to their content, it is not surprising that learners are facing difficulties in finding and accessing the most accurate information they are looking for. Consequently, learning tools such as learning objects (LOs) and repositories are now gaining popularity in educational environments and special care must be devoted to developing and operating such systems. In contrast to these issues, Web-based systems do provide greater extensibility and interoperability through the use of domain ontologies. Ontologies and use of semantics offer dynamic sequencing of learning and contents, integration and reuse of content, distribution of services (resulting also in new models of learning) and additional analogous benefits (Brooks, Greer, Melis & Ullrich, 2006). Currently, the Semantic Web holds genuine promise for the supporting of a wide range of educational activities on the Internet (Allert, Richter & Nejdl, 2002; Bourda & Bich-Lien, 2003; Ellis & Hislop, 2007; Mohan & Brooks, 2003; Nash, 2005; Secundo et al, 2004; Stojanovic, Staab & Studer, 2001). Koper (2004) emphasises the role of the Semantic Web in supporting education from the perspective of both the teacher and the learner. Koper states that topics related to the application of the Semantic Web to education can be classified into a number of categories such as ontologies for education, Semantic Web tools, education theory, LOs, etc. Here, ontologies play an important role in the effective use of LOs. In order to realise an ontology for Kindergarten through 12th grade (K–12) education, Askar, Altun, Kalınyazgan & Pekince (2010) proposed a domain specific ontology, Personalized Ontological Learning Environment, with the emphasis placed on its development and incorporation into an e-learning environment. LOs are defined as all digital resources that can be used and reused to support learning (Wiley, 2000). Churchill (2007) further developed this definition through the general classification of the definitions of LOs found in literature. He summarised that those definitions as an LO can be the following: (1) an instruction or presentation object, (2) a practice object, (3) a conceptual model, (4) anything digital and (5) anything digital and non-digital. 2 British Journal of Educational Technology © 2011 The Authors. British Journal of Educational Technology © 2011 BERA. In describing LOs, researchers have often referred to instructional and educational aspects of using such tools. Wiley (2000) preferred the use of the atom metaphor in which he emphasised the importance of instructional design in connecting various LOs to each other in forming a lesson. McGreal (2004) emphasised LOs as reusable digital resources built into a lesson and interactive practice exercises. LOs were also defined as small, stand-alone units of instruction by the E-learning Competency Center (2003). Nash (2005) evaluated the current practices in the use of LOs within online courses and suggested new approaches that incorporated learning theories. Kay and Knaack (2007), and Akpınar (2008) stressed the importance of evaluating LOs and their use in learning environments. The main features of LOs such as accessibility, interoperability, reusability, adaptability, scalability, durability and granularity played an important role in the current widespread use of such sources for teaching and learning in educational settings. The creation of a large number of LOs also aroused the questions of how to store, sort, allocate and deliver LOs. From the mid-1990s, learning object repositories (LORs) began to crop up within the Web, for the main purpose of sharing and accessing LOs. Li, Nesbit and Richards (2006) differentiated the main features of LOs from other educational software by noting their ready availability through the Web-based repositories. An LO repository can be defined as being an example of a digital library. Indeed, more than 25 years ago, Illich (1971) introduced the concept of the learning Webs. He proposed a kind of environment in which people would be “active teachers and producers of educational knowledge as a result of their self-directed learning activities” (Wikipedia, 2009). LOR enables teachers and learners to use, share and manage instructional resources. It requires a metadata standard in implementation. LOR stores resources with their metadata record. Accessibility features in repositories such as the referred metadata standard (IEEE, Dublin Core, SCORM, IMS, etc.) and query options (simple or advanced) have been widely considered in the design and development of such systems. Since the beginning of the early 2000s, continuous efforts have been visible in increasing the efficiency of repositories in terms of accessibility and operability. The concentration of issues focusing on the use of ontologies and Semantic Web structures were also apparent as they enhance the accessibility and shareability of LOs through interoperability between various repositories. Such technologies are leading open technologies and, as Koper and Sloep (2003) state, the focus is on “open” technologies, which are shared in order to advance learning and underlying knowledge. On the other hand, the Open Educational Resources (OER) has been defined as “teaching, learning and research resources and including full courses, course materials, textbooks, and any materials and techniques to support the access to knowledge” (Wikiversity, 2010). One of the core attributes of the OER is considered to be “that the content is liberally licensed for reuse in educational activities, favourably free from restrictions to modify, combine and repurpose the content; consequently, that the content should ideally be designed for easy reuse in that open content standards and formats are being employed” (OLCOS, 2007). The OERs present a wider range of educational offerings compared with LOs, and the courses and materials within them can be rearranged to be used as LOs. When dealing with LOs, we must keep in mind that the movement towards greater collaboration in the creation and sharing of educational content will involve many future considerations, as evidenced by the creative commons licensing approach. It seems that the OER movement will have impacts on the design and use of learning materials. In that respect, quality issues are serious and many authors have emphasised the fact that the pedagogic value of the LOs is the most important factor (see McGreal, 2006). Many researchers have analysed the existing LORs in terms of their structural and contextual features, such as their metad	accessibility;blackwell (series);bruce ellis;definition;digital library;dublin core;durability (database systems);extensibility;geforce 9 series;internet;interoperability;john d. wiley;mind;nash equilibrium;nonlinear gameplay;ontology (information science);open content;operability;prospective search;requirement;scalability;semantic web;table (database);usability;user requirements document;wikipedia;wikiversity;world wide web	Serpil Yalcinalp;Bulent Gursel Emiroglu	2012	BJET	10.1111/j.1467-8535.2011.01212.x	educational technology;the internet;social science;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;qualitative research;multimedia;sociology;management;law;statistics;pedagogy	HCI	-74.82825989127225	-32.530540149384386	156585

Digital assistive technologies (such as screen readers) are typically out of reach, so individuals depend on Braille and audio recordings to access educational content. Unfortunately, there are acute shortages of Braille and high quality audio books for many subjects, leaving students scrambling for ways to continue their education. We present a formative study that examines the educational landscape for low-income visually impaired communities in rural and peri-urban India, the challenges they face in accessing educational content, and the solutions they have invented. We conducted interviews with 16 stakeholders, including students, teachers, and content producers, to understand the education ecosystem in their communities and how they use technologies such as basic mobile phones to consume, create, and share educational content. In particular, we found that these communities have established an informal network of peer-produced audio content that is shared via Bluetooth, memory cards and CDs.

(UPV/EHU in its Spanish and Basque acronyms). The research's goal was to establish the guidelines for training opportunities in information and communication technologies (ICTs) that could better address the needs of the faculty at the aforementioned university. The conclusive results provide a picture of the necessary training in ICTs that the faculty requires for their teaching as well as for conducting research. This led us to develop some suggestions that are related to the modular organization of past and present training courses as well as improved guidelines that would help us to restructure the design of the training currently being offered. This restructuring is fundamental in order to include ICTs in the new European space of higher education (ESHE).

All fully employed people cannot imagine their work without a computer nowadays. In addition, more and more people also use social network sites on a regular daily basis, either for private and/or business purposes. In this study the authors attempt to firstly define a concept of social network sites as well as explore their types. Secondly, the authors of this article discuss pedagogy behind the creation of a social network from all stakeholders' point of view. Thirdly, they set a few pedagogical principles, including the universal principles set already by Jan Amos Comenius in the 17th century. Finally, they emphasize the potential of educational social networks in students' motivation to learn.	social network	Blanka Frydrychova Klimova;Petra Poulova	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-32865-2_3	computer science;artificial intelligence;social pedagogy;management science;implementation;pedagogy;social network	ECom	-72.74894286233112	-31.172651954443957	157120

They are used to communicate about science and sometimes to involve citizens in science (e.g. citizen science). Concurrently, environmental decision analysis is challenged by the high cognitive load of the decision-making process and the possible biases threatening the rationality assumptions. Difficult decision-making processes can result in incomplete preference construction, and are generally limited to few participants. We reviewed 43 serious games and gamified applications related to water. We covered the broad diversity of serious games, which could be explained by the still unsettled terminology in the research area of gamification and serious gaming. We discuss how existing games could benefit early steps of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), including problem structuring, stakeholder analysis, defining objectives, and exploring alternatives. We argue that no existing game allows for preference elicitation; one of the most challenging steps of MCDA. We propose many research opportunities for behavioral operational research.	decision analysis	Alice H.

With increasing access to ever-more advanced technologies, it is important to explore the implications for the adolescents who use them. This research aimed to examine the construction, deconstruction and reconstruction of adolescent identities through an exploration of the design choices and social practices of elementary students on two social networking sites. Using a mixed-method research approach of qualitative case study analysis and quantitative surveying, we investigated the relationship between a multiliteracies pedagogy and the development of adolescent digital literacies and identity. Findings from the research indicate that social networking sites provide youth a platform in which to explore their identity.

The author draws upon his many years of teaching and school administration (see the authors resume at http://fno.org/JM/resume.html ) to offer insights into and examples of the use of information technologies by teachers. The style is informal with pithy titles followed by short bursts of information and comment served up with cliche and mixed metaphor. On the one hand, if read too quickly, it is a just-too-fast conveyor belt of cute sayings. On the other hand, if read at a more leisurely pace, it leaves many detailed process questions unanswered.	compiler	Richard Malinski	2000	Educational Technology & Society		pedagogy	HCI	-71.52735015772059	-29.551871142754326	158345
015eb0b40d2a14df74b663fbff7d0ce05812d15b	online learning: strategies for pedagogical retooling		Higher education can be conceptualized as a partnership between the learner and the institution. However, this may necessitate changes in practice, such as the development of flexible learning models to accommodate individuals from a range of backgrounds and life circumstances, particularly those traditionally excluded from higher education. Flexible modes of learning may encounter resistance or fail to deliver expected outcomes, however, thus limiting adoption. Pedagogical retooling can address this. This paper reviews the current status of one type of flexible delivery—online learning—in terms of stakeholder views, the need for continued institutional responsiveness, and pedagogical strategies that support desired outcomes. The latter includes pedagogical training that involves implementing elements of effective course design, simulating the student learning experience, forming communities of practice, and sustaining practice with follow-on support.	online machine learning;pedagogical agent;responsiveness;simulation	Maureen Snow Andrade	2016		10.5220/0005749600850090	knowledge management;pedagogy	HCI	-76.36375020293863	-35.53334806900382	158424

Students needs to be successful in their context and a possible way to achieve this is by developing the computational thinking. In the last few years there are several initiatives to promote computational thinking and to define approaches and methods to support it. One of this is the unplugged methods, in which students develop computational thinking skills without using the technology. This paper presents an experiment to promote computational thinking by using unplugged methods and employing robots as teachers as an engagement factor for the students. During the experiment, they have been distributed in two groups. One has carried out unplugged activities to develop computational thinking while the other did not. From the experiment, it is possible to see that results are better for those students that have completed unplugged activities and there are differences depending on age.	computation;computational thinking;experiment;robot;robotics	Miguel Ángel Conde González;Camino Fernández Llamas;Francisco J.

The intended outcome of this increased IT-facilitated student engagement is to foster important skills such as critical thinking used in both academia and workplace environments. Critical thinking (CT) skills entails the ability(ies) of mental processes of discernment, analysis and evaluation to achieve a logical understanding. Critical thinking in the classroom as well as in the workplace is a central theme; however, with the dramatic increase of IT usage the mechanisms by which critical thinking is fostered and used has changed. This article presents the work and results of critical thinking in a virtual learning environment. We therefore present a web-based course and we assess in which parts of the course, and to what extent, critical thinking was perceived to occur. The course contained two categories of learning modules namely resources and interactive components. Critical thinking was measured subjectively using the ART scale. Results indicate the significance of ‘‘interactivity’’ in what students perceived to be critical-thinking-oriented versus online material as a resource. Results and opportunities that virtual environments present to foster critical thinking are discussed. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper expounds on this idea by proposing a mobile virtual community (MVC) platform for elderly healthcare based on a services concept. The requirements for this platform are elicited using a method based on in-depth interview sessions with clients and caregivers in a care institution, a workshop with multiple stakeholders, and scenario-based user need analysis. We focus on the technical platform that is intended to fulfil the requirements elicited from this approach. The platform is an extension of our existing MVC platform architecture, based on service-oriented principles. It enables user-tailoring through an adaptable set of mobile and platform services. We describe the platform and discuss its current and novel services as distilled from the requirements elicitation.	asp.net mvc;industrial and organizational psychology;information needs;landauer's principle;model–view–controller;needs analysis;requirement;requirements elicitation;service-oriented device architecture;signals intelligence;socialization;testbed;usability;virtual community;windows firewall	Jan-Willem van't Klooster;Bert-Jan van Beijnum;Pravin Pawar;Klaas Sikkel;Lucas O.

Before students arrive at college they are using typically using blogs, wikis, forums, social connection systems, digital asset sharing systems, and even community game systems to stay connected. When students reach college, their social networks change in both their function and structure. Institutional emphasis is placed upon Course ware/ Course Management Systems (C/CMS) to augment lecture, classroom and discussion section experiences. While a C/CMS may share similarities with their favorite SMS, students do not always experience the same level of social engagement from them as they do with the tools they use outside of the academic experience. This paper examines how students perceive SMS, examines what students consider SMS, and addresses feature differences between SMS and C/CMS mechanisms.	management system;social media;social reality	Christopher A.

CSCW research explores questions involving numerous distinct—though interacting—phenomena at multiple levels of description. The useful approach may be to clearly distinguish levels such as individual, small-group and community units of analysis, and to differentiate terminology for discussing these different levels. Theory in general has evolved dramatically over the ages, with a trend to extend the unit of cognition beyond the single idea or even the individual mind. Seminal theoretical works influential within CSCW suggest a post-cognitive approach to group cognition as a complement to analyzing cognition of individuals or of communities of practice.	cognition;computer-supported cooperative work;framing (world wide web);interaction;irreducibility;mind;theory	Gerry Stahl	2011			social science;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;sociology;communication;management;social psychology;anthropology	HCI	-64.39665047445038	-33.40579591525624	160243

The evolution and spread of mobile technology from year 2000s enabled their migration to this new platform: The Mobile Learning. Making it possible for professionals and students can carry with multimedia tools with Internet access to learning tools or professional references. This new concept fits very well the needs of Health, in which students must absorb and put into practice large amounts of technical knowledge, and also professionals must stay constantly updated. Distance Education in Health has received prominence in Brazil. A country of a geographically dispersed group of professionals, and research & training centers concentrated in the capitals. Updating field teams is a difficult task, but the information has access to modern technologies, which contribute to the teachers who use them. This paper, through the methodology of literature review, presents technology experiments in health environments and their considerations.

Insights will be outlined about the benefits of these technologies in terms of data visualization and archival practices, as well as the potential user base for library-centered 3D printing and scanning services. Design/methodology/approach – This paper describes why the Dalhousie University Libraries purchased a 3D printer and scanner, the challenges of maintaining these technologies and instructing students in their use, and how Dalhousie faculty members and students have made use of these technologies for their own research purposes. Findings – 3D printing and scanning technologies can be of use to a much wider range of Faculties than have traditionally had access to them. The unique role libraries have on university campuses allows them to function as universal access points for these technologies. By offering 3D scanning technology, they can also use this technology internally for archival purposes. Originality/value – While much has been written on 3D printing and scanning technology, very little has been written about how these technologies could relate to academic libraries. This paper sets the groundwork for further exploration into how 3D technologies can improve and expand library services.	3d printing;3d scanner;archive;data visualization;library (computing);printer (computing);wireless access point	Michael Groenendyk;Riel Gallant	2013	Library Hi Tech	10.1108/07378831311303912	digital library;3d printing;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-69.68456982431832	-25.765248106852127	161666

This remarkably changes the way of teaching and learning. This work discusses a framework for orchestrating global collaborative activities towards some common goal that represents a grand challenge and beneficial both on local and global levels. This framework consists of some common goals, a group of leading researchers, some international industries, a forum, Web sites for resource sharing, and a collaboration-model. A prominent common goal is optimum curriculum design. How people learn with technology is a scientific inquiry, and by its own has been the aim of such endeavors. But, from the application point of view, one can say that all these endeavors are for accumulating knowledge in the hope that one day such knowledge can lead to optimum curriculum design. This work presents some arguments of this challenge.	conn;computer;grand challenges;money;telecommunications network	T M Vanessa Chan	2004	Proceedings.

After presenting the peculiarities of the educational system in a federal state like Switzerland and its impact on CSE, we try to answer several questions about CS teachers, their profile, and their representations of the field. Recognizing that the primary field of study of most current CS teachers was not CS, we question their representations of CS in search of potential differences between specialists and non-specialists. On this basis, we analyze the distance between CS as it is taught in French-speaking Swiss high schools and CS as its teachers think it should ideally be taught. Finally, we present the important need for continuing education of CS teachers and the fact that, according to them, it should include both technical and didactic aspects.	computer science;switzerland	Gabriel Parriaux;Jean-Philippe Pellet	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-46747-4_15	optometry;political science;media studies;pedagogy	Logic	-74.10383390425743	-31.715081413172616	162121
8685976d13b3b3d07ae0cbd11a387718db59a47d	the lifetime of email messages: a large-scale analysis of email revisitation		Email continues to be one of the most important means of online communication, leading to a number of challenges related to information overload and email management. To better understand email management practices in detail, we examine the distribution of visits to emails over time. During their lifetime, emails may be visited one or more times, and with each visit different actions may be taken. Emails that are revisited over time are especially interesting because they represent an opportunity to improve email management and search. In this paper, we present a large-scale log analysis of email revisitation, the activities that people perform on revisited email messages (e.g. responding to, organizing or deleting messages, and opening attachments), and the strategies they use to go back to these emails. We find that most emails have a short lifetime, with more than 33% having a lifetime of less than 5 minutes. We also find that deleting is the most common action taken on messages visited once, and that responding and organizing are more common for messages visited more than once. We complement the log analysis with a survey to understand the motivation behind revisits and the types of emails that are revisited. The survey results show that 73% of the visits are to find information (e.g. a link or document, instructions to perform a task, or answers to questions), while 20% of revisits are to respond to the email. Our findings have implications for designing email clients and intelligent agents that support both short- and long-term revisitation patterns.	attachments;browsing;computer-mediated communication;email;information overload;intelligent agent;log analysis;organizing (structure)	Tarfah Alrashed;Ahmed Hassan Awadallah;Susan T.

Successful engineering design projects in secondary schools require extensive support for both teachers and students. Computer-based learning environments can support both teachers and students to implement and learn from engineering design projects. However, there is a dearth of empirical research on how engineering approaches can augment learning in authentic K-12 settings. This paper presents research on the development and pilot testing of WISEngineering, a new web-based engineering design learning environment. Three middle school units were developed using a knowledge integration learning perspective and a scaffolded, informed engineering approach with the goal of improving understanding of standards-based mathematical concepts and engineering ideas. Seventh grade math students from two teachers in a socioeconomically diverse and low-performing district participated in three WISEngineering units over the course of a semester. Students significantly improved their mathematical scores from pretest to posttest for all three projects and on state standardized tests. Student, teacher, and administrator interviews reveal that WISEngineering projects promoted collaboration, tolerance, and development of pro-social skills among at-risk youth. Results demonstrate that informed engineering design projects facilitated through the WISEngineering computer-based environment can help students learn Common Core mathematical concepts and principles. Additionally, results suggest that WISEngineering projects can be particularly beneficial for at-risk and diverse student populations.		Jennifer L. Chiu;Peter T. Malcolm;Deborah Hecht;Crystal J.

This paper reports on research to introduce programming in such school curricula and to evaluate possible benefits of such introduction for students’ motivation towards learning in general. The research was based on the creation of a methodology for designing and offering programming courses at public and private schools and to verify possible correlations between students’ performance and schools’ economic scenarios they find themselves in. Preliminary results indicate that students who participated in the courses at schools with economic restrictions and inferior quality of IT infrastructure may still present better results in the courses. In addition, there is evidence of gains in their motivation towards learnig other subjects. The paper details results, analyzes causes for them and illustrates and explores implications for participating students at schools operating across the economic spectrum.	booster (electric power)	Paulo César G. de Brito;J.

Here we focus on how technology can be designed to fit within, leverage, and be part of the strategies and tools that fitness trainees and instructors use to detect and correct performance errors. Drawing on ethnomethodological approaches and using the concept of correction to focus our analysis, we scrutinize the interaction between instructor and trainees in two fitness activities, AntiGravity Fitness and Pilates. We identify social configurations and resources employed in instances of correction. We also present an analytical tool useful for deconstructing such correction processes, highlighting the strategies and resources used by the social actors, and their impact on performance. Based on insights gained from our analyses, we propose design recommendations and identify design opportunities that capitalize on existing tools and collaborative correction strategies, such as scaffolding the correction process.	align (company);human–computer interaction;multistage amplifier;recommender system;strand (programming language)	Laia Turmo Vidal;Elena Márquez Segura;Annika Wærn	2018		10.1145/3196709.3196789	leverage (finance);human–computer interaction;engineering;management science;scaffold	HCI	-64.97533327396123	-36.84292738525839	162877

Computer-based technologies are promising in creating environments for people to communicate with people from diverse cultures. This qualitative synthesis of quantitative and qualitative research therefore aimed to investigate the literature in respect to intercultural learning through technology use. Besides reporting research descriptives in the literature, this review brought eight main points to the light: (1) an overall satisfaction with digital tools and intercultural learning, (2) increased knowledge toward both own and target culture, (3) superficial and factbased exchange between similar cultures and profiles, (4) varied levels of intercultural communicative competence development, (5) lack of in-depth analysis and of detailed reports, (6) necessity for training, guidance, and good communication skills, (7) need for stimulating contexts, and (8) technical and institutional challenges. The current study is timely to help researchers and practitioners to both comprehend the existing literature and to find new research and practice directions in the field.	emoticon;the superficial	Emrullah Yasin Çiftçi	2016	Educational Technology & Society		psychology;cultural competence;educational technology;social science;context effect;computer science;engineering;qualitative research;electrical engineering;sociology;management;social psychology;pedagogy;intercultural relations	HCI	-75.01612188689123	-35.080859761166344	162990

Liquid life (Bauman, 2006) is frenetic, rapidly changing and highly influenced from information and communication technologies, and forces subjects to adapt to group behavior avoiding exclusion. Human beings are experimenting with the digital age and the pervasiveness of computers and IT/ICT equipment, which are influencing learning and knowledge construction. This raises questions in regard to a privileged role for digital competences in the knowledge society, whether or not there is a framework for digital competence assessment, and possible hints, suggestions, experiments, protocols, or curricula helping teachers in hitting this target with students. This paper answers these questions, describing the evolution of psycho-pedagogical paradigms and their comparisons. A framework for digital competence assessment is proposed and teaching activities are suggested. A proposal of a teaching-learning process called OTS (Open Teaching Process) is also presented.

A new breed of intelligent learning environments called learning companion systems was developed over a decade ago. In contrast to an intelligent tutoring system, in which a computer mimics an intelligent tutor, the learning companion system assumes two roles, one as an intelligent tutor and another as a learning companion. Motivated by recent interest in agent research and other technologies, this learning companion field has received increasing attention. This study addresses issues that arise from different perspectives on this research effort. With a view to future networked learning environments, the learning companion is redefined for application to a wide spectrum of educational agent research. Accordingly, several subjects that relate to educational agents, and hence learning companions, are identified. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach – Data are collected from 224 Taiwanese undergraduate and graduate students to assess the influence of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control on the intention to seek information in an academic digital library. The results of structural equation model-fitting analyses show that the TPB is better than the TRA in predicting the information-seeking intention in an academic digital library. Findings – Specially, the empirical results indicated that perceived behavioral control is a better predictor of behavioral intention than is attitude or subjective norm. Research limitations/implications – This paper assessed self-reported information-seeking intention as part of the survey and, as a result, could have introduced inaccuracies. Practical implications – The findings of the paper will help academic digital libraries to address the key factor which influences users’ intention to seek information and to intensify their performance to meet user needs. Originality/value – Although the nature of the user experience in the digital environment appears to be quite different from the experience of looking through archival boxes or folders, research on the use of academic digital library services is scarce – particularly regarding user intention in the process of seeking information. The TRA and TPB are novel and usable in explaining the intention of online users to seek information, and these findings may be generally applicable to academic digital libraries and users.	amiga walker;archive;causality;digital environment;digital library;external validity;futures studies;information seeking;kerrison predictor;library (computing);online and offline;relevance;risk assessment;structural equation modeling;theory;usability;user experience;word lists by frequency	Chiao-Chen Chang;Chia-Yen Lin;Yu-Ching Chen;Yang-Chieh Chin	2009	The Electronic Library	10.1108/02640470910966899	structural equation modeling;digital library;simulation;design methods;theory of reasoned action;computer science;artificial intelligence;social psychology;world wide web;theory of planned behavior	HCI	-74.3852513846122	-25.21001639033644	163526

We outline three abandoned designs and explain why they were ultimately not pursued, focusing on the challenges of balancing enjoyability, feasibility of production, and impact. We discuss design strategies, including: masking games’ persuasive intentions, prioritizing prototypes with their efficacy-to-cost ratio in mind, and designing for fun first. This discussion offers insights into the design of both non-digital and digital “games for impact” that allow designers and researchers alike to learn from these promising but problematic prototypes.	amiga reflections;buffalo network-attached storage series;digital data;game theory;load balancing (computing);persuasive games;verification and validation	Max Seidman;Mary Flanagan;Geoff F.

For instance, the hyperaccessibility associated with mobile phones reduces the felt distance between people who are separated by geographical space (Cummings et al., 2001; Sommer, 2002; Turkle, 2006; Katz and Byrne, 2013). This paper discusses how interpersonal distance, i.e., the perception of separation in space and time that people sense between themselves and others who are significant to them, is influenced by digital communication. It also explores the psychological mechanisms that can explain this influence. This work draws inspiration from construal level theory (Trope and Liberman, 2010), as well as specific studies that have explored psychological distance in specific situations, e.g., in virtual work groups (Wilson et al., 2013) and real-time streaming video situations (Lim et al., 2012). Our contention is that construal level theory can be applied to understand the effect of digital communication on a broad range of human relationships.	expanded memory;game theory;mobile phone;real-time clock;streaming media;virtual work	Elisabeth Norman;Hege E.

We studied the use of CAM in three student design projects. We observed that CAM facilitated new ways of collaborating in joint design projects. The serendipitous and asynchronous nature of CAM facilitated expressions of design aesthetics, allowed designers to have playful interactions, supported exploration of new design ideas, and supported designers' reflective practices.

This paper explores how instruction in communication can draw upon principles common across modes of communication. I first survey guidelines for the design of scholarly posters and categorize the types of advice they provide. Second, I use the categories of advice to develop a framework which highlights principles of communication common to written, oral, and visual communication. This framework should help instructors to (1) identify opportunities for facilitating the transfer of communication skills among modes and contexts, and (2) to balance instruction between fundamental principles of communication and techniques specific to a mode or software tool.	categorization;informatics;information design;pdf/a;programming tool	Melissa D.

To design progressive technology integrated science curriculum for use and for learnability, it is necessary to understand the presumed literacies in the designed artifact and the ways that the designed artifact engages students in various literate activities... We explore the multiple literacies presumed in the design of inquiry curriculum created at the Center for Learning Technologies in Urban Schools (LeTUS). The current design of LeTUS inquiry-based, technology embedded science curriculum presumes a facility with, and strategic use of literacies on the part of students who enact the curriculum. Here literacy means two things: deriving meaning from patterns in knowledge domains like science and facility with different information forms. We use teacher interviews and on-line discussions to expose presumptive literacies in design and learners' literacy challenges.	embedded system;learnability;new literacies;online and offline	Kimberley P.

Tracy, Attribution-NonCommercial (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) CC BY-NC. This study establishes baseline information about the ways library publishing services integrate user studies of their readers, as well as common barriers to doing so. The Library Publishing Coalition defines library publishing as “the set of activities led by college and university libraries to support the creation, dissemination, and curation of scholarly, creative, and/or educational works.” This area includes traditional as well as novel publication types. Results suggest that discussions of library publishing underrepresent engagement with readers but that ample room for increased attention remains. Existing reader-related efforts vary widely and may in some cases be happenstance. These efforts also face key barriers in lack of prioritization, lack of expertise, and lack of control of out-of-the-box platforms.		Daniel G.

The current challenge is to provide professional development (PD) that will be transformative: rather than merely exposing participants to reform instructional materials, it will change what future instructors believe is worthwhile in science education. Our view is that professional development is most effective when it enriches the intellectual life of teachers and builds taecher identity by cultivating concern with student thinking. In an example of an activity that originates in this perspective, participants interview peers about physics concepts and conduct structured reflections on the interviewing experience. The activity holds promise for improving participants' abilities to listen and to teach effectively, increasing their esteem for the intelligence that teaching requires, and increasing their interest in K-12 physical science teaching as a profession.

The police have, since the advent of radio communication systems, deployed mobile technologies to support officers in conducting their jobs and offer an exemplary domain for studying the use of mobile technologies. This paper applies the theory of virtualization as a means to characterize the use of mobile technologies for operational policing. The paper suggests the concept of rhythms of interaction as a method of characterizing the alternation in intensity of communication through and with mobile technologies and the intricate relationships between physical and virtual contexts of work. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Focus extends from the showing of art to its creation, and the empowerment and agency of communities through enactive learning. In this model the arts organisation acts as a catalyst for collaborative action and enquiry involving academia and a wider ecosystem of communities and stakeholders including the public, artists, digital creative industry, maker spaces and local government. The new model entails embedding of research, innovation and arts practice within the arts organisation itself. We illustrate the approach with examples of projects spanning mental health, physical disability, young people, veterans, children and parents, which have had a real impact on health and well-being of our communities.	ecosystem;enactivism;file spanning;olap cube;usb hub	Mark Wright;Mike Stubbs	2016	Digital Creativity	10.1080/14626268.2016.1241807	visual arts;human–computer interaction;arts in education;computer science;artificial intelligence;sociology;management;social psychology	HCI	-68.97657901395873	-31.936273447682648	165877

Nesna University College has been using the example of sexual abuse of children in case study teaching in social informatics, in order to create an environment for intrinsically motivated learning. The project also gave the students a unique opportunity to get involved both emotionally and practically in the field of social informatics. The project is run in cooperation with Save the Children Norway and the Norwegian National Crime Squad. Nesna University College has the only computer science program in the world that has sexual abuse of children as the main topic on the curriculum. The computer science students provide both the Save the Children Norway and the National Criminal Investigation Service with reports on various topics such as secure chat, camera phones and possible abuse, Freenet as a tool for sexual abuse, etc. This exceptional cooperation between higher education and public and private organizations in this field makes the project not only unique, but might also be a major factor in both the willingness of students to learn social informatics and their development of skills in the various topics of social informatics.	social informatics	Per Arne Godejord	2007	JASIST	10.1002/asi.20522	social science;simulation;motivation;anonymity;project;computer science;student engagement;higher education;law;world wide web	HCI	-72.76468098501171	-32.47226292583673	166083

Twitter is suitable for the simulation of trade of the attention, because Twitter field has many similarities to the attention economy. However, Twitter is inadequate for the visualization of the trade of the attention. The attention on the Twitter can be represented only by the action of the follow. Additionally, the allowable number of the follow is beyond the capacity of the human's attention, whereas the human's attention's being finite. This research studies the environment for visualization of the attention trade on Twitter and simulates the attention economy approaching the real world. As a result, this simulation is expected to motivate the economic activity with the concept of the attention economy and to develop its analytical method.	prototype;simulation	Yoshihiro Kawano;Yoshito Kishimoto;Tatsuhiro Yonekura	2011	2011 14th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems	10.1109/NBiS.2011.51	simulation;visualization;attention;computer science;multimedia;upper and lower bounds;data visualization	Robotics	-64.20317908800423	-28.239714288894476	166368

The concept of component exchange community emerged as a means of realizing one of the missions of G1:1 speeding up researches through exchanges of research components. Possible types of research components include software, subject matter content (learning objects), and methodologies. It aims at building a platform for fostering international collaboration, providing a novel way for the research work by an individual or laboratories to be accessed by the wider research community and users, and, in return, increasing research impacts of these researches. Component exchange community motivates maintenance of good quality documentation. This paper describes the concept and its model of component exchange community.

INTRODUCTION Our research focus has long been the study and support of human-computer interaction, but it has gradually shifted from a focus on individuals and their cognitive processes to groups and their cognitive processes. Some groups that we have been supporting and studying have been professional communities defined only by their common interests for whom we, or others, provide services. Other have been major international projects with better defined membership related to an agenda of specific tasks. What we have come to realize is that the effective support of such communities depends on modeling not only the cognitive processes of individuals, but also those of the community as a whole. Many of the tools we have developed support community processes, and the most significant and challenging of these are those that model these processes dynamically so that the community can reflect upon its own operations. One may see some of the issues by contrasting two recent books: Nielsen's (2000) Designing Web Usability is a valuable application of classical HCI principles to the design of web sites; Kim's (2000) Community Building on the Web is also valuable in proposing well-grounded good practice for managing the human side of a web community.

The reform effort was an online collaboration among four teachers in 4 and 5 grades classrooms to implement a design problem-based unit meant to develop higher-order thinking responses in students. The unit design principles are correlated to current research in the cognitive sciences and the teachers’ efforts at implementing reform are correlated to current research in theories of innovation. The initial description will also briefly characterize aspects of the implementation process that led to productive or less productive reform results. The questions that will be developed in this forum include: 1. How can teachers’ professional development programs to increase the effectiveness of innovation in education? 2. Do students have a stake in educational reform including emerging technologies-specifically constructivistbased learning principles-, as in are these learning principles important and valid for students? 3. How can educational systems encourage innovation in education? 4. How can communities support efforts to change in education? 5. Are reforms, such as the integration of advanced technologies within a constructivist-based learning environment meant to develop higher-order cognition valued in today’s society? 6.

By discussing the present limitations of educational computing research the paper goes onto suggest an agenda for advancing and improving inquiry in this area. In particular the discussion focuses on the need to embrace diverse methods of research and theoretical approaches to examining educational computing, as well as the need to ask `wider' questions of the social, cultural, political and economic aspects of ICT in educational settings. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Our account is organized historically, starting with the origins and early development of electrical engineering education beginning in the late 1800s, and then tracing out the rise of new subfields and specialties during the inter-war and post-WWII periods. The development of computer engineering as a field is given special attention as a case study in disciplinary (dis)integration, while setting the stage for a discussion of broader trends associated with the rising influence of digital techniques and technologies across electrical engineering. The final sections of this paper report on some contemporary challenges and opportunities that may further transform the field in upcoming years and decades, with particular emphasis on issues of demographic diversity and perceptions of broader relevance and impact. The approach of this paper is largely historical, drawing on a wide variety of primary and secondary source materials. It is expected that this paper will be of interest to anyone who would like to know more about the historical development of electrical engineering education, including in relation to more contemporary currents in the field.	computer engineering;electrical engineering;relevance;secondary source	Brent K.

Existing examples of networking games require players to interact as part of the game-play, and therefore do not bypass the stressful part of networking. In contrast, many other games successfully encourage interaction between players whilst avoiding causing stress to the players. Flashbulb is a networking game that only requires a photograph of another player to be taken in order to progress. Players can choose whether to start a conversation depending on the target and situation. Thematic analysis of interviews with Flashbulb players found that despite not including an icebreaking requirement, it encouraged networking and widened the scope of those spoken to. The act of photographing players promoted conversations without forcing players to engage in uncomfortable discussions. We make recommendations for the design of future iterations of networking games.	icebreaker;iteration;play store;while	Emily Collins;Anna L. Cox;Frank J.

He concluded that prospects based their assessments of credibility on factors other than the words the salesperson spoke---the prospects studied assigned 55 percent of their weight to the speaker's body language and another 38 percent to the tone and music of their voice. They assigned only 7 percent of their credibility assessment to the salesperson's actual words. Over the years, this limited experiment evolved to a belief that movement and voice coaches would be more valuable to teaching successful communication than speechwriters.

a2cd39cffc2c4dbab5398aeb2ee8a54efadb3bdb	formula collection mobile apps realized by teachers.		Formula collections are books used in several European countries to support the practice of mathematics of by its learners and later by its practitioners. They are compendia of mathematical formulæ that students employ during their studies, and which may be of use in later professional life. This research explores the opportunity of bringing the formula collection to the mobile phones of the school students. It is motivated by the fact that the formula collection may be one of the rare objects that pupils may refer to later in their lives, when mathematical knowledge needs to be recalled. Making it a mobile phone app makes it a zero weight object which is in easy reach. Technically, this app is realized by a set of HTML files compiled into a mobile application. This makes the formula collection a first class citizen that students can easily access. More importantly, this makes it an artifact that teachers can create themselves instead of relying on a publisher: using their notations and their selected content. The centerpoint of this research is to enable teachers in creating and delivering such an app to the mobile devices of their students. 1 Motivation: What can a Formula Collection do and why could it be mobile? Formula collections are books used by mathematics practicioners, be they pupils, students, or workers, in order for them to be reminded of the essential formulæ they can apply. These are generally small books, or sometimes photocopies, which teachers choose as representing the essential knowledge. Formula collections are generally short and thin, so that they are always at hand anytime they practice mathematics, in particular, in all exercises and exams. The formula collections follow the spirit that nothing in math needs to be learned by heart and that such collection constitutes the complete set of knowledge that one would need to refer back to, when trying to remember the mathematics one has already practiced.	anytime algorithm;book;compendium;compiler;first-class citizen;first-class function;html;mobile app;mobile device;mobile phone;photocopier	Paul Libbrecht;Kerstin Schneider	2014			embedded system;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science	HCI	-72.76755440637206	-28.703771648456346	167919

The student must perform his/her own research with validation under supervisor’s guidance. The student’s own research work must be differentiated from others work in order to demonstrate the unique originality and significance of the students’ contribution. The information explosion on the Internet makes the survey analysis much more difficult. This paper suggests a solution by recording both the students’ own research work and others work into a meta data, and compare them for further analysis as part of student’s dissertation. The record based eLearning system can track the progress of student’s research studies in, problem statement, proposed solution, analysis, findings, publication and feedback, in an eLearning system.	information explosion;internet	Joseph Fong;Herbert Shiu	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-85170-7_12	computer science;knowledge management;e-learning;world wide web;pedagogy	HCI	-76.99942485249382	-37.56748700189301	168356

The typical response is either to remove files or to compress them, or to invoke some combination of the two approaches. But there are many situations where the choice is not so cut-and-dried. Let’s say there is a file filling up a storage partition that cannot be removed because its data should be kept for a rolling window of one year or because its contents are sensitive or because it is being held open by a process. In such cases it is better to shrink the file in size instead of removing or compressing it.

Analysis was from data collected through a questionnaire, to a 50% sample of schools in May 1999 and semi structured interviews with a cross section of staff at 20 schools, conducted during the period September 1999 until September 2001. The findings indicate that despite an overwhelming acceptance of the value of such systems, they are generally being used to provide specific statutory returns and administrative type functions. This is as opposed to use as a constant monitoring tool for self-evaluation, performance management, alerting and feedback, which is then used to inform the teaching and learning process. The paper goes on to propose a hypothesis as to why this is occurring and makes suggestions as to how the situation may be remedied. The research and its findings are part of the LEAs continuous evaluation of the use of ICT in its schools and the remedies which follow are part of its planning for the future.	information systems;management information system;semiconductor industry	Alan Strickley	2004	Education and Information Technologies	10.1023/B:EAIT.0000024261.33160.41	simulation;knowledge management;management information systems;mathematics;cross section;management;operations research;world wide web;educational assessment;statistics;pedagogy;data collection	HCI	-76.08995961410228	-32.65270379893118	168946

Nevertheless, courses in DH are still usually hosted by English, History or Social Sciences departments, with little or no room for courses offered by Foreign/Modern Language departments. In addition, both undergraduate and graduate humanities students may not feel attracted by courses that focus on digital technologies. In order to overcome these challenges, the Department of Modern and Classical Languages at George Mason University (Virginia, U.S.) is currently carrying out an innovative, participatory curriculum development project involving undergraduate students as consultants and co-producers of course content. This paper describes the theoretical framework for the project and its current stage of development. Advantages and limitations of student engagement in curriculum design are also addressed.	digital humanities;mason;participatory monitoring;relevance	Esperanza Román-Mendoza	2016		10.1145/3012430.3012633	mathematics education;library science;digital humanities;engineering;pedagogy	Web+IR	-74.06833159166013	-29.712271767823147	169084

Based on our experiences we recommend applying this approach to equally overcome effects of group dynamics in similar courses as well as to bridge the generational gap that normally exists between students and professors.	bridging (networking);experience	Christina B.

Recently, studies about digital games in these areas have begun to appear. Some educators have a vision that these games have the potential to become powerful motivating digital environments and they study digital games in order to determine how motivational components of popular digital games might be integrated into instructional design. This study investigated whether digital games facilitate children’s cognitive achievement in comparison to traditional computer-assisted instruction. One hundred and fifteen third-graders from a middle/high socio-economic standard school district in Tainan City, Taiwan participated in the study. Results indicate that digital game playing not only improves participants’ fact/recall processes, but also promotes problem-solving skills by recognizing multiple solutions for problems.	book;cognition;digital data;digital media;interactive media;multi-function printer;personal computer;problem solving;toys	Tsung-Yen Chuang;Wei-Fan Chen	2007	Journal of Multimedia	10.4304/jmm.2.5.27-30	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;digital media;game mechanics;instructional design;multimedia	HCI	-70.07558941211624	-37.58335779438445	169135

In computer lab management, tracking usage of software and hardware is always a challenging obstacle. At Lewis & Clark College, we have struggled to establish and provide for the correct lab usage quickly and efficiently. This obstacle involving lab usage has become especially critical, as we have seen an increase in the use of computer labs over the past couple of years. Until recently we were unable to provide clear evidence and accurate data of the increased usage to our decision makers. The recent deployment of LabStats solved this problem for us.  LabStats, a Computer Lab Solutions product, has given us a chance to seek the information we want, whenever we want. In this paper, I discuss how we continue to utilize the information provided from LabStats in order to become more efficient and effective in customer service and managing lab resources. I also illustrate how LabStats features can assist lab managers in their daily responsibilities of: application usage, offline lab computers, tracking student users, lab inventory, live usage display, managing lab hours, and a slew of other uses to maximize lab capabilities	computer hardware;computer lab;money;online and offline;printing;reduction (complexity);software deployment	David Christopher Dean	2010		10.1145/1878335.1878372	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;multimedia	AI	-68.5252119009285	-26.1204901314885	169390

One of the best examples is how to guide students in their learning processes. The need to look for guidance from their teachers or other companions that many Internet users experience when endeavoring to choose their readings, exercises o practises is a very common reality. In order to cater for this need many different information and recommendation strategies have been developed. Recommendation Systems is one of these. Recommendation Systems try to help the user, presenting him those objects he could be more interested in, based on his known preferences or on those of other users with similar characteristics. This document tries to present the current situation with regards to Recommendation Systems and their application on distance education over the Internet.	e-commerce;freedom of information laws by country;information overload;internet;recommender system	Oscar Sanjuán Martínez;B.

We discuss the concept of core competencies applied to policies for teaching and training information professionals, particularly librarians. Method. Sixty graduates of the Institute were employed as information professionals. These sixty were asked to attribute degrees of importance to specific items associated with knowledge and skills that, within the scope of this research, were considered core competencies for meeting the demands of their jobs. Participants were also asked to cite knowledge they acquired in school and knowledge they use in exercising their profession, the skills that they consider necessary but that they did not gain in school, and the difficulties they encounter in exercising their profession and for which they were not sufficiently well prepared. Analysis. Both quantitative and qualitative data analyses were performed. The data were tabulated using Access and several reports and cross-tabulations were generated. Results. The results suggest a gulf between knowledge and skills acquired in library school and those that are required by the job market. In particular, participants lacked the skills they needed to work with information and communication technologies. Conclusion. The concept of core competencies is increasingly taken into account by the productive sector of the economy. The educational system ought to keep up with this change. The empirical research described shows that there is a need to establish advanced and modern policies for the education of librarians, participants in the market for Abstract Page 1 of 17 Information professionals: core competencies and professional development	gulf of evaluation;information;job stream;librarian	Flávia Regina Ferreira;Joanice Nascimento Santos;Lucyana Nascimento;Ricardo Sodré Andrade;Susane Barros;Jussara Borges;Helena Pereira da Silva;Othon Jambeiro;Fábio Ferreira;Bethany Lynn Letalien	2007	Inf.

Building web-based learning opportunities by exploiting these resources is a complex endeavor with controversial motivational underpinnings. It requires provision of support for accessing, using and packaging the resources with interoperable, usable and userfriendly tools and within a trustworthy environment. In this paper, we address the interoperability issue by implementing tool support for the process of designing learning opportunities based on existing educational resources in a tool called OpenGLM.We conducted a qualitative end-user evaluation based on an instructional design task. Addressing the motivational underpinnings, we identify a number of challenges and opportunities to adoption of formal instructional modeling: on the individual level the main challenge is the lack of motivation to share good-practice examples; on the institutional level the key to harness the opportunities lies in the provision of support measures and quality control.	interoperability;teaching method;web application	Michael Derntl;Susanne Neumann;Petra Oberhuemer	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-25813-8_27	knowledge management;database;management science;world wide web	HCI	-76.27698825471406	-37.30925239187874	170187

Further, pinning down a standard curriculum is difficult – there are many preferences which are hard to accommodate. This paper argues the case that part of the problem is the fact that, unlike more established disciplines, the subject does not clearly distinguish the study of principles from the study of artifacts. This point was raised in Curriculum 2001 discussions, and debate needs to start in good time for the next curriculum standard. This paper provides a starting point for debate, by outlining a process by which principles and artifacts may be separated, and presents a sample curriculum to illustrate the possibilities. This sample curriculum has some positive points, though these positive points are incidental to the need to start debating the issue.	artifact (software development);computer science;http public key pinning;software development;software system	Philip Machanick	2003	Computers & Education	10.1016/S0360-1315(03)00045-9	mathematics education;emergent curriculum;social science;applied mathematics;computer science;curriculum mapping;academic standards;pedagogy;curriculum theory	AI	-74.72140950231582	-29.833655054085426	170251
977f40e2a35f01c30c814e168d530f044a46a200	measuring inquiry: new methods, promises & challenges	selected works;bepress	Contemporary views of science education regard scientific inquiry and the ability to reason scientifically as the essential core of science education (American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), 1993; Chinn & Malhotra, 2002; NRC, 1996; Krajcik et al, 1998; Songer et al, 2003). According to White and colleagues, scientific inquiry is an active process comprised of four primary components: theorizing, questioning and hypothesizing, investigating, analyzing and synthesizing (White & Frederiksen, 1998; White, Frederiksen & Collins, in preparation). Measuring these inquiry processes as well as the products that result from the processes has long been a challenge for educators and researchers (Marx et al, 2004); however, advances in technology and measurement are creating new possibilities for assessing both process and product (Pellegrino, Chudowsky & Glaser, 2001; Behrens, 2009). There are three themes that this symposium is addressing: what inquiry is and is not, the best way to teach inquiry, and the best way to measure inquiry. We have chosen a widely accepted definition of what inquiry is by White et al, described above, and are focusing our work on the latter, how to best measure inquiry.

To arrive at this end, a staff must remain abreast of the constant change in computer technology, as well as the changing needs and wants of its users. At the University of Notre Dame, we have found that student employees have the potential to excel in the area of user services support, and many times they can do so in a more cost effective manner than a full-time staff member. With careful planning and consideration on the part of those supervising the students, their employ can grow to benefit themselves, the full-time staff, and most importantly, the users. If the process of successfully utilizing students were as easy as it sounds, this paper would have no raison d'être, but there are serious questions to be posed when considering student employees: who to hire, and why; how they should be trained; how to motivate them to reach their fullest potential; and how to most effectively manage them.	as-easy-as;computer	Mark B.

We suggest that PeriodShare is a design fiction that uses both crowd-funding rhetoric and the form of a rather clumsy DIY project to create a particular fictional universe that (1) speculates on a potential near future of quantification of menstruation, and through this (2) encourages to reflection on the dynamics of contemporary technology paradigms like the politics and culture of self-tracking, sharing, and intimate data. As a research through design project and by using these communication threads, PeriodShare thus uses menstruation as a trope to investigate social, cultural and political issues of intimate technologies.	conversation threading;crowdfunding;issue tracking system;semiotics;social network;speculative execution	Marie Louise Juul Søndergaard;Lone Koefoed Hansen	2016		10.1145/2971485.2996748	management	HCI	-62.92257925223097	-30.579078667687885	170748

This paper reports on the in-progress development of a new middle school curricular module for Big Data, situated as part of a new CS Principles-based middle school curriculum. Big Data is of widespread societal importance and holds increasing implications for the computer science workforce. It also has appeal as a focus for middle school computer science because of its rich interplay with other important computer science principles. This paper examines three key aspects of a Big Data unit for middle school: its alignment with emerging curricular standards; the perspectives of middle school classroom teachers in mathematics, science, and language arts; and student feedback as explored during a middle school pilot study with a small subset of the planned curriculum. The results indicate that a Big Data unit holds great promise as part of a middle school computer science curriculum.	big data;cs games;computer science;futures studies;situated	Philip Sheridan Buffum;Allison G.

We will describe how having two lecturers in the lecture theatre can provide more opportunities for live examples, coding demonstrations, discussions and in-lecture exercises leading to a varied delivery which was perceived as more engaging than a traditional lecture format.  Furthermore, we argue that pair teaching supports professional development by facilitating self- and peer-review, sharing domain knowledge, as well as helping new lecturers to become familiar with an established lecture series. As a side effect, we discovered that teaching as a pair is a less isolating experience and much more fun.

Starting from a theoretical informatics subject now we have a combination of using information and communication technologies (ICT) while learning many subjects with some basic elements of informatics (computer science). The general curricula of information technologies (IT) for lower secondary schools in Lithuania were essentially revised and renewed. The paper deals with the goals and approach of introducing ICT into general education. It discusses the competencies and values to be developed while teaching and learning IT and with IT. The links with other school subjects and the relationship between the compulsory IT course and the integrated parts as well as optional modules are described.

The first context TT is developed for and tested in is sloyd education [Swedish: slöjd], a compulsory subject taught in Finnish schools. In sloyd learners design and manufacture unique artifacts in various materials (textiles, wood, metal, and electronics). The process-based work flow of sloyd lends itself well to this kind of educational tool, which aids multimodal documentation, communication, and instruction. The empirical study targets what student teachers (N=11) microblogged about and the character of the blog posts during a sloyd project. A sociocultural perspective of appropriating new tools for learning is used as a theoretical frame, as well as views on multimodality and transmedia. Their sloyd process is discussed in terms of transmedia storybuilding, as learners build their own story as a flow of content through their documentation and interactions. ‘Talking Tools’: Sloyd Processes Become Multimodal Stories with Smartphone Documentation	artifact (software development);blog;documentation;mobile app;multimodal interaction;smartphone	Annika Wiklund-Engblom;Kasper Hiltunen;Juha Hartvik;Mia Porko-Hudd;Marlene Johansson	2014	IJMBL	10.4018/ijmbl.2014040104	simulation;content analysis;documentation;computer science;operating system;multimedia;electronic publishing;world wide web;pedagogy	HCI	-70.87252135734433	-35.6597243587778	171979

An interactive problem-based, scenario-based, web-based assessment tool, iSkills, has been developed through a broad-based effort to establish standards for performance and certification of ICT literacy proficiencies. This paper aims to discuss the assessment’s potential in determining the effectiveness of instruction programs. Design/methodology/approach – Since January 2001, a consortium of experts in ICT literacy served as advisors to the Educational Testing Service (ETS) test developers as they designed an internet-delivered assessment that measures students’ abilities to research, organize, and communicate information using technology. This paper reviews that R&D process, concluding with an example of its application to information literacy program planning and evaluation. A mixed methods approach collected and analyzed qualitative sources and iSkills pre-test/post-test data for first-year Purdue University students. Findings – Findings informed curricular decisions for instituting an integrated problem-based learning (PBL) information literacy program. Secondary goals included developing an understanding of how information-processing skills are acquired, identifying best practices for integrating information literacy into the curriculum, and assessing the impact of skill acquisition on overall academic achievement. ICT literate students are generally better problem-solvers, more self-directed, and communicate ideas more efficiently. Practical implications – Universities are beginning to require ICT literacy as competencies for graduation. This paper presents a new strategy for assessing the effectiveness of instructional programs which aim to matriculate proficient students. Originality/value – This paper reports on the efficacy of a problem-based learning (PBL) approach involving three convergent principles of design: the organization and dissemination of information, the creation and communication of information, and problem solving within the context of research projects and assignments. As such, it provides important insights into pairing an innovative instructional approach and the iSkills ICT literacy assessment.	best practice;enterprise test software;information literacy;information processing;problem solving;requirement;test data;web application	Mary M.

1b8b74e17db889d873b81e9a7ca41e8bd6510ed3	characterizing the triggering phenomenon in wikipedia		Collaborative knowledge building achieves better results than individual knowledge building essentially due to the triggering phenomenon taking place among the users in a collaborative setting. Although the literature points to a few theories supporting the existence of this phenomenon, yet these theories have never been validated in real collaborative environments, thus questioning their general prevalence. In this work, we provide a mechanized way to observe the presence of triggering in knowledge building environments. We implement the method on the most-edited articles of Wikipedia and show that it may help in discerning how the existing knowledge leads to the inclusion of more knowledge in these articles. The proposed technique may further be used in other collaborative knowledge building settings as well. The insights obtained from the study will help the portal designers in building portals enabling optimal triggering.	crowdsourcing;normalized google distance;portals;realms;refinement (computing);semantic similarity;theory;web of science;wikipedia	Anamika Chhabra;Sudarshan Iyengar	2018		10.1145/3233391.3233535	knowledge building;knowledge management;normalized google distance;word association;phenomenon;computer science	HCI	-66.12589894936552	-32.18807673323276	172035

It is a foundational issue for the social sciences, in which researchers try to understand the behaviors and statements of other people. It is of particular relevance to CSCW and CSCL, where participants have to understand, work with and learn with each other. Philosophers have posed the issue of how an individual can understand another and how a small group or community can have a joint understanding, shared intentionality or we-awareness. Studies of CSCW not only adopt insights from the philosophy of intersubjectivity to ground their methodology, they also contribute to the analysis of how intersubjectivity is established in concrete settings, including in virtual environments. Similarly, CSCL research can investigate how groups of people learn to construct intersubjective understandings in both traditional and technologically enhanced interactions. While classical phenomenology of intersubjectivity started from the cognitions of a solitary mind, the notion of intersubjectivity has subsequently shifted to a more social view. Recent studies of intersubjectivity suggest a structure of group cognition, which can provide a foundation for collaboration in work and learning that incorporates but transcends individual cognition.	cognition;computer-supported cooperative work;intentionality;interaction;intersubjectivity;relevance;virtual reality	Gerry Stahl	2016	Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)	10.1007/s10606-016-9243-z	psychology;social science;developmental psychology;phenomenology;sociology;communication;management;social psychology;anthropology;collaboration	HCI	-64.44901555292896	-33.58916074400623	172284

The opportunity to involve users more in the creation of news content has been exploited in various ways: for instance as discussion forums or as visitor responses to particular questions. This paper reports on an experiment investigating one form of this new kind of interaction, drawing on data from an e-mail questionnaire sent to visitors to The Guardian newspaper's Election 97 website who observed or participated in a series of themed discussion forums in the run up to the 1997 British general election. We present an evaluation of the visitors’ behavior in the forums, their motivation and their perceptions of the discussion space. We discuss the findings in relation to the underlying model of the website, pointing out how, despite the flexbility offered by this new mode of interaction, the traditional publisher-contributor relationship remains preferable to both users and developers.	world wide web	Ann Light;Yvonne Rogers	1999	J.

Online technologies open great opportunities for (notionally global) dissemination of information. The internet levels the field, giving access to a wealth of resources. Textbooks, recorded lectures, and online course notes have low incremental dissemination cost, which is a principal enabler of the free and low-cost programs. But is that enough? Tutoring and feedback -- and the dialogues that nurture critical thinking -- are individual and hence labor-intensive, and tend not to feature in mass-market, low-cost programs. Information access may be relatively cheap in this milieu, but high-quality education still requires substantial investment. This talk will discuss the difference between 'education' and 'learning some stuff', in the context of MOOCs and other online educational developments.	information access;internet;massive open online course;milieu intérieur	Marian Petre	2012		10.1145/2401796.2401809	simulation;engineering;multimedia;world wide web	DB	-73.84443404223128	-35.310635393623926	172905

In this paper we present the process and technology to develop an online system to share multiple experiences of Aboriginal Culture in NSW, Australia within a social-constructivist framework. The focus of the material is the Kinship system used for thousands of years in this region. This topic exemplifies the knowledge used to maintain societies and provides the setting for social conflict with the non-Aboriginal people who came here in recent history. We are using stories from the community to augment the learning material. Using innovative web services, teachers can select the stories that are relevant to their course, and link these within a range of scenarios being developed. The scenarios enable students to select the way they relate to the characters, listen to their stories, and become aware of their own role in the community.	digital history;emulator;open-source software;social constructivism;web service;on-line system	Cat Kutay;Deirdre Howard-Wagner;Lynette Riley;Janet Mooney	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33642-3_7	cultural competence;knowledge management;pedagogy	HCI	-72.76965920552009	-36.89804910315931	172950
baa1c690ec56023d6e7324585e3aee3a247e891e	from learning objects to language learning objects: communicative language teaching principles in call material		"""Learning Objects (LOs) have increasingly become of interest to users and researchers of Information and Communication Technologies (Wiley, 2002; Gibson, 2002; Leffa, 2006). There are several definitions, an ample discussion and criticism in relation to what can be considered a LO. Leffa (2006) indicates the state of the art of LOs and points to the lack of theoretical support in the production of such resources. Therefore, since more attention has been paid to technological aspects than to pedagogical ones in the development of LOs, the authors consider it necessary to have a theoretical basis that supports the design of such objects and makes them congruent to the learning of foreign languages (FL) with an emphasis on communication. Hence, this paper proposes a definition of Language Learning Objects (LLOs) that attend to the principles of Communicative Language Teaching (Canale & Swain, 1980; Ellis, 1999, 2005; Paiva, 2009) and Pedagogical and Design Usability (Vetromille-Castro, 2003).

There have been several social initiatives, such as government policies that equip schools, the reduction in computer prices and the proliferation of services such as those of LAN gaming centers and cyber cafés. In Brazil, one of the main reasons for the proliferation of distance higher education courses is the lack of an offer of such courses in towns in the interior of the country. According to ABED (Brazilian Association of Distance Education), 2.64 million Brazilian citizens took online courses in 2008. Brazil’s Ministry of Education (MEC) has implemented initiatives for the development and use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in basic education, specially via COGETEC (General Coordination of Education Technology. Still in Brazil, when we look at higher education, we can find initiatives such as the Open University of Brazil (UAB) – which started in 2006 and is managed by MEC and CAPES (a research funding organization) – and Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) as a whole. UAB provided people with the possibility of access to higher education programs, free of charge. Only to mention one educational/professional area, UAB offers 51 online undergraduate mother/foreign language teaching courses all over the country (Capes, 2010). Both UAB and CALL as a whole illustrate how distance education is growing in a developing country, and such growth not only justifies the data presented on the number of students in this form of teaching, but also demands quality instructional materials, suitable for digital/distance contexts. With the growth of CALL, the need for more and more research into the field of online language learning becomes urgent, as well as the resulting production of material to attend to the new developing paradigms. To some extent, what has happened in Brazil in recent years illustrates the kind of social change the world has gone through and that inevitably brings about a series of implications in each and every aspect of society, including education. Thus, pedagogical practices in language teaching in general and in foreign language (FL)/second language (L2) teaching in particular have gone through changes and transformations too, and, at this moment in the development of CALL, it is essential that researchers and teachers have comprehensive knowledge on learning in virtual environments, both in terms of FL/L2 teaching methodology and instructional/CALL material development. Concerning the latter, due to increased possibilities of autonomous learning that ICT tools have provided individuals with, one can try and start studying any subject matter – including foreign languages – without the formal help of a teacher, only by searching and finding instructional materials on the Internet. Similarly, users of different languages can assist and “teach” one another their own mother tongue by suggesting activities they find on the World Wide Web, as in tandem learning contexts. Also, teachers who cannot develop their own instructional/CALL materials but have or want to use ICT resources in their courses – be it for their own desire or be it from institutional pressure – can use search engines and find learning activities. Such (online/offline) digital materials and activities are labelled as learning objects (LOs). It is essential to highlight, however, that we do not believe or support the idea of “technological panacea”, or, as Bax (2011, p. 3) posits, “exaggerated ‘awe’’ at new technology’s potential, but we see ICT tools as real and present possibilities in educational contexts. Thus, one can notice that LOs are well implemented in the education technology scene, in several different areas. We can explain the special appeal for these tools in education technology since they represent media that students of the 21st Century – described by Veen and Vrakking (2006) as homo zappiens and by Prensky (2001) as digital natives – are accustomed to and feel comfortable with. Taking this fact into consideration may mean that tasks with LOs are potentially rich and motivating for such students, since they provide a “familiar” environment for the learning process. However, while the access to LOs has been increasingly widespread on the Internet, CD and DVD content, potentially augmenting 13 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/learning-objects-languagelearning-objects/77628?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Library Science, Information Studies, and Education, InfoSci-Select, InfoSci-Educational Leadership, Administration, and Technologies eJournal Collection, InfoSci-Select, InfoSci-Select, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Communications and Social Science.

These two approaches to CA are linked to first-order cybernetics and second-order cybernetics, respectively. Design/methodology/approach – The author illustrate and support the argument made by showing in a review of earlier work as well as three case studies of CA use in architectural design work how linear, science-based “first-order CA” cannot adequately support design processes. In such contexts, CA are typically adapted to allow for circular, conversational processes and to take involved observers into account. Findings – The analysis of the three case studies shows that design-oriented approaches to CA aimed at generating novelty require “second-order CA” – CA that are based on second-order cybernetic principles. Research limitations/implications – Limitations of this paper arise from the limited number of reported and analyzed case studies as well as from a necessary simplification and generalization of observations for the sake of brevity. Originality/value – Findings resulting from the investigation emphasize and extend early experimental approaches to CA in design-related contexts that conceived CA systems as part of conversational design processes. The transition from first-order to second-order CA is necessary to allow for speculative and explorative design conversations that support designers in generating novelty in conversational settings.	automata theory;cellular automaton;first-order predicate;first-order reduction;second-order cybernetics;simulation;speculative execution;symbolic computation	Christiane M.

How many of you come from institutions of 2500 or less? How many come from institutions of 1000 or less students? How many of you have your own computer? Are there any of you who don't have your own computer on campus? Of those who don't have their own computer on campus, how many are using some kind of real-time system or shared system of some sort? So everyone in here is in some way already in the computer racket. Now let me get one more pair of questions and then break off from this kind of audience participation. How many of you come from institutions where your computer is used almost—not necessarily altogether, but almost—exclusively for administrative purposes? Are there any people here whose computer is used altogether for instructional or educational purposes? Okay, that gives me a good idea of where things stand. It's really quite a broad spectrum of interests and backgrounds, as one might expect. Meetings of this kind frequently announce that they are appealing to small colleges, but because small colleges can't afford to come, the medium-size colleges, who think they're small anyway because they look at their budgets and realize what they'd like them to be, are the people who make up the group. I'm pleased to see the broad spectrum of interest.  There were a good many comments earlier about curriculum. I come to you in a sense from the American Society of Information Science, a group with which I've had a good bit of involvement, and it is currently espousing a new curriculum look, inspired in part by “Curriculum '68.” In the American Society for Information Science we would make the claim—incidentally, I should preface this perhaps, with Harris's charge to me to produce some nice, controversial comments and bait you into a great deal of response—that information science is the basic routine, and computer science is a facet of it. This is also true of library science and several other fields which are quite different. All these have a common interface in an area which might be called information science, and as such, the American Society for Information Science recognizes that curriculum efforts so far have all been so computer oriented, so specifically use-of-computer oriented, that they've decided to explore the possibilities of some more curriculum material. One of the interesting things to me is that your comments this morning led me to realize that there has been no consideration built into this plan, per se, for the smaller schools. I think that's a big mistake, and I intend to try to see that something is done about it. I don't know how far this might be carried.	computer science;flaming (internet);harris affine region detector;information science;library science;racket;real-time computing;real-time operating system;real-time transcription;weatherstar	Robert A Kyle	1972		10.1145/800273.809365	mathematics education;library science;simulation;computer science	Theory	-65.36583434978576	-24.571196368054284	173626

The question is whether the bridge between school and other arenas open or closed – is there a barrier? The paper asks what strategies/ changes/challenges have to be in place for the school to access and utilize learning arenas which are alternative to the formal learning arena?

For a generation that will create more information than was created by all those who came before them access to information is not an issue, at least for those on the access side of the digital divide. However as that wealth of information grows so does the need for the skill sets that allows one to pull the drops of needed information from the ocean that they have available to search. Students, who have not known a world without Google, smart phones, and abundant wireless internet access, often feel their research skills are good enough but usually fail, not in the search for information, but in the ability to determine what the best information is and how to find it most efficiently. Online library research classes are one of the best methods for providing students with the skills they need to succeed. Designing, implementing, and teaching library research classes allows librarians to communicate research skills that meet our students at their point of need. This paper will provide an examination of the benefits for students, libraries and faculty in providing these classes, an overview on how they can be structured to meet the information literacy needs of any student and basic information on how to create library research classes at any institution of higher education.	freedom of information laws by country;information literacy;internet access;librarian;library (computing);principle of good enough;smartphone	James Thull	2015	IJIDE	10.4018/ijide.2015070103	distance education;computer science;information literacy;multimedia;world wide web;research	AI	-73.32890149872281	-28.47134620990536	173964

In this context, an important issue is maintaining control over personal data, i.e., who is able to access which information. In this paper, we argue why traditional access control mechanisms are inappropriate for collaborative workspaces in general and present a concept for privacyrespecting access control in a web forum as an instance of collaborative workspaces.	access control;control system;internet;personally identifiable information;workspace	Stefanie Pötzsch;Katrin Borcea-Pfitzmann	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-14282-6_8	human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;world wide web	Web+IR	-63.545053558650366	-28.332453628484508	174413

The purpose was to investigate the types of information sources used by the students, their preferred information formats, the importance of and reasons for using certain information sources and the use of various electronic information sources. A questionnaire was distributed to 200 randomly selected students and 102 completed questionnaires were returned. The study found that printed materials were the most preferred information format among the students. The top five most preferred information sources, in the order of importance, were books, lecturers, the Internet, friends and manuals. Unexpectedly, the use of databases and electronic journals was quite low among the computer engineering students. The study recommends a promotional campaign for introducing electronic information sources to the library users.

Unfortunately, the topic of establishing mechanisms for meaningful parent-teacher communication is often slighted during the preparation of teachers. New teachers entering classrooms need the opportunity to interact and communicate with parents during their preparation program. This article examines how one reading tutor used technology to communicate with parents about their child's literacy growth while the child was enrolled in a university -based tutoring program called the Reading Improvement Clinic. Specific examples illustrate how this technology-based approach enhanced the communication process with parents while sharing tutoring information, student progress reports, and tutoring artifacts. Several advantages o f using such an approach include easy access to student materials and assessments, timely postings of the child’s work and tutor comments, and a secure environment for sharing confidential documents. Contemporary Issues in Technology and Teacher Education, 6(1) 12 It is well established that building home-school partnerships is a powerful avenue for increasing the satisfaction of parents and the community with schooling and for improving schools (Bauch, 1989; Comer, 1986; Epstein, 1992; Epstein & Salinas, 2004; Henderson & Berla, 1994). When parents and teachers have rich and frequent communication, they can forge the partnerships that produce benefits for children. Additionally, as the discourse between homes and schools increases, understanding improves, suggestions are shared, and positive attitudes are more easily m aintained (Ames, Khoju, & Watkins, 1993). In a research-based framework, Epstein et al. (2002) suggested six types of involvement to help parents participate in ways that meet student needs and family schedules. Two key types of involvement included in these six are creating two-way communication and involving families with their children in academic learning at home. Recognizing the critical need for parent-teacher communication, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) requires that schools communicate with all families and involve them in ways that enhance students’ success (Lewis, 2002; U.S. Department of Education, 2002). Unfortunately, teacher education efforts are often insufficient to fully prepare beginning teachers for home-school communication, and this continues as a need area for many practicing teachers, as well (Fredericks & Rasinski, 1990; Stevens & Tollafield, 2003). Thus, new teachers entering classrooms must understand the importance of home-school communication and should have opportunities for actual conversations or connections with parents under the guidance of faculty responsible for their professional preparation. Common examples of home-school interactions include notes and phone calls, newsletters, parent-teacher conferences, home visits, weekly folders, dialogue journals, and/or open house nights (Baskwill, 1996; Bohler, Eichenlaub, & Litteken, 1996; Farris, Fuhler, & Walther, 2004; Flood & Lapp, 1989; Fredericks & Rasinski, 1990). To address barriers of time and schedules, e-mail and Web-based communications have emerged as viable options to increase parent-teacher interaction and provide school–based information in a timely and consistent manner. In fact, in many communities, communication via e-mail has become commonplace (Bauch, 1989; Zisow, 2002). School and classroom Web sites promote and maintain home-teacher communication by informing parents and community members of school and classroom activities (Bigalow, 2003; Solomon & Andres, 1998). In addition, homework hotlines and online student management portals extend opportunities for families to stay linked to classroom requirements and resources (Ammann, 2001; Fish, 2003; Zisow, 2002). Electronic portfolios offer a unique and contemporary approach to help inform parents of children’s efforts, progress, and achievement over time. Electronic portfolios can contain digital artifacts that capture children’s voices in unique ways (Barrett, 1998, 2000; Harris & Reifel, 2002). Electronic portfolios also offer a storage advantage and can make children’s work portable and accessible (Barrett, 2000; Diehm, 2004; Havens, 2003). Typically, parents find it difficult to get information from their uncommunicative children about what happened during school (Beverly, 2003; Kasprowicz, 2002). Instead, parents are seeking other methods like school Web sites and portals to obtain that information. According to the 2004 Nielsen/NetRatings survey, 74.9% of U. S. households with a phone line have access to the Internet (Web Site Optimization, LLC, 2004). Parents with access are beginning to rely more on these online sites for daily updates about their child’s grades, attendance, and homework (Fusco, 2004; Meyer, 2000; Weinstein, 2005). These online communication mechanisms are more convenient for parents, as they do not have to interrupt their workday to phone a teacher or attend a conference (Beverly, 2003). Contemporary Issues in Technology and Teacher Education, 6(1) 13 This article describes how parent-teacher communication might be enhanced using a Web-based system that manages student reading artifacts along with teacher insight and explanation. Parents are requesting additional access to more evidence of their child’s progress, so this approach provides specific artifacts documenting academic progress, not just a reported grade or a homework assignment summary. In order to address some of these issues, a tutoring program for young readers focused on utilizing technology to communicate a child’s literacy growth with parents. Specifically, this article describes the parent communication component within a graduate-level tutoring course in reading. Included is the Web-based approach one tutor used to communicate with the family whose child was enrolled in a university -based, tutoring program. First, the requirements of the tutoring course and its relationship to the Reading Improvement Clinic are described. Next, the parent-tutor communication assignments completed in the course by all tutors are explained. In this section, artifacts prepared by one tutor and posted for parents using a Web-based environment are presented for each assignment. Finally, observations and recommendations concerning technology -based family communication and the plans for a research study that evolved are shared. The Reading Improvement Clinic Experience At this Midwestern, public university, students enroll in CI 588 Supervised Tutoring in Reading (three credits) directly after student teaching and licensure or during their graduate program in literacy. Paired with a companion course, CI 552 Diagnosis and Correction, the enrolled students are typically completing Department of Education requirements for a Title I reading position or meeting a school district’s demands for additional reading coursework. The CI 588 class time (seven 4-hour Saturday sessions throughout the semester) includes experiences with informal literacy diagnostic procedures to approximate a child’s instructional range, as well as tutoring strategies to address children’s literacy growth. Area families of children in grades 1 through 8 apply for one-on-one tutoring in the Reading Improvement Clinic, and each CI 588 student engages in 25 hours of tutoring an assigned child with literacy needs. To accommodate the variety of schedules, each tutor/child pair arranges the tutoring days, times, and location, with each family responsible for that child’s transportation. Family and tutor schedules determine the biweekly tutoring schedule. For example, some tutoring pairs meet Tuesday and Thursday afternoons from 4:00-5:00 in scheduled campus tutoring rooms; another pair might meet Wednesday early evening and Saturday afternoon in a study booth at the local public library. The seven 4-hour Saturday sessions, distributed throughout the semester, are supplemented by WebCT communication requirements of each tutor. That is, CI 588 students use an instructor-tutor private forum to post their tutoring plans for the upcoming week and to post their reflection after each tutoring session. This private forum gives the instructor a window into each tutor’s processing, successes, and concerns. The biweekly reflections also allow the instructor to respond to the unique instructional materials, strategies, and challenges that each tutor encounters. During the class meetings held throughout the semester, tutors share successes and concerns in two ways. Whole class discussions address general concerns, and the instructor provides examples Contemporary Issues in Technology and Teacher Education, 6(1) 14 of strategies and resources for tutors to consider. Students also move to gradelike/instructional range-like small groups to share materials and approaches. During the initial CI 588 class, students are reminded that the semester will extend and refine the following three “growth lines”: 1. With the tutor’s careful planning, material selection, and teaching during the one-on-one tutoring, the literacy strategies of the assigned child will be enhanced (Baker, Gersten, & Keating, 2000; Cohen, Kulik, & Kulik, 1982; Fitzgerald, 2001; Glass, Cahen, Smith, & Filby, 1982; Juel, 1996; Wasik & Slavin, 1993). 2. With careful observation, reflection, and tutoring modifications based on their observations, tutors each will better understand literacy development and their own teaching strengths and growth areas (Boyd, Boll, Brawner, & Villaume, 1998; Brunner, 1994; Furlong, & Maynard, 1995; Henderson, 1989; Kagen, 1992). 3. The required family communication component of the course ensures that parents will acquire an enhanced understanding of their child’s literacy strengths and need areas, as well as exposure to resources and activities for family literacy reinforcement (Epstein, 1995;	accessibility;amiga reflections;approximation algorithm;barrett reduction;brian henderson-sellers;cognitive tutor;computer-mediated communication;confidentiality;coupling (computer programming);courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;denial-of-service attack;digital artifact;douglas comer;email;experience;forge;harris affine region detector;interaction;internet;interrupt;maynard electronics;person of interest;portals;public library;requirement;schedule (computer science);secure environment;software documentation;telephone line;world wide web	Su-Wen Kuo;Yuan-Chen Liu;Ssu-Hua Huang	2004		10.1109/ICALT.2004.1357673	the internet;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;electronic publishing;clinical study design;law;world wide web;pedagogy	HCI	-77.35890415914454	-33.11112188390772	174557

Data analysis involved 1) analysis of content in both written essays and digital videos; 2) the development of transmediation visualizations to elucidate how ideas were transformed from essays into videos; and 3) multimodal analysis to understand the communicative affordances and constrains for argumentation with each medium. The findings revealed that the most common type of content in both essays and videos was supportive argumentation; however, the videos did not include any counterargumentation. Students transformed different amounts of ideas in different ways when transmediating their argumentation from essays into videos. Both assignments offered unique affordances for building an argument based on their modes of communication. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. The argumentative essay is the most common genre that students are assigned to write in higher education (Wingate, 2012), perhaps because it is viewed as an effective vehicle for constructing knowledge in a wide variety of disciplines (Tynj€al€ a, 1998; Wu, 2006). When argumentative essays are approached holistically, as in this study, awritten argument refers to the whole text (see Wingate, 2012), and building an argument to the way in which writers construct “a connected series of statements intended to establish a position and implying response to another (or more than one) position” (Andrews,1995, p. 3). According toWingate (2012), the process of building an argument in a written essay consists of three components: (1) the analysis and evaluation of content knowledge, (2) the writer's development of a position, and (3) the articulation of that position in a coherent manner. First, writers are required to distinguish relevant from irrelevant information and to identify different, conflicting viewpoints drawn frommultiple sources. They should also be able to evaluate which ideas are useful in providing sufficient evidence for the essay. Second, writers need to be able to compare and contrast evidence found in the literature when establishing their own position. When achieved in a sophisticated manner, writers will have evaluated, weighed, and combined arguments and counter-arguments in support of their position they are seeking to establish (Nussbaum & Schraw, 2007). Finally, the evidence should be organized as a logical text structure so that it clearly establishes the position taken. Smith), carita.kiili@jyu.fi (C. Kiili), merja.a.kauppinen@jyu.fi (M. Kauppinen). B.E. Smith et al. / Computers & Education 102 (2016) 138e151 139 Digital multimodal compositionsdwhich interweave text, sound, visuals, and movementdcan also be used to construct knowledge in different disciplines (Ho, Nelson, & Müeller-Wittig, 2011; Kucirkova, Messer, Sheehy, & Panadero, 2014; Looi, Chen, & Ng, 2010). Such multimodal projects (e.g., digital videos, podcasts, websites), when assigned in academic contexts, can also integrate Wingate's (2012) three components for building an argument; however, these compositions may take different shape when constructed through multiple modes and digital tools. Despite the fact that a growing majority of youth communicate multimodally outside of school (Lenhart, 2015; Rideout, Foehr, & Roberts, 2010) and many educators have begun to integrate multimodal projects into the curriculum (Miller, 2013), there is a paucity of research examining how students build an argument using multiple modes in digital environments. Furthermore, little to no research has examined the relationship between written and multimodal argumentation. That is, how ideas transmediatedor translate content from one sign system into another (Suhor, 1984)dbetween argumentative written essays and argumentative digital videos. This study addresses these unexplored areas by examining how university students built and transmediated argumentation across these two different mediums. Through comparative analysis (Stake, 2006), we examined how argumentation was constructed in each medium, traveled across them, and the unique communicative affordances offered by each medium. 1.

First it the capability approach and explains why using critical pedagogy is a valuable way to deal with issues of power, collective conscientisation and adaptive preference. Freire’s pedagogy is then presented and conscientisation is explained as a process of raising critical awareness and praxis. The case study, presents empirical work conducted in Campinas, together with a NGO named CDI, which offers free internet access and basic ICT skills using a Freire’s inspired methodology. Findings are then explained and discussed using the theoretical framework. This paper concludes that there is great value in using Freire’s critical pedagogy for digital inclusion, but that further research is necessary to identify less resource intense solutions that can provide students with both conscientisation and skills.

In fact, this is always the case in distance education, due to geographical dispersion and disparate time schedules of learners. Very often, peer-to-peer socialisation in distance education only occurs as part of formal learning activities, or is just left to the student's own initiative. This situation is compounded by the modularity of Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), forcing students to jump from one module space to another as they progress through a course. All discussion threads, conversations or record of previous dialogues are then lost. This paper reports on the design, development and extensive evaluation of a Virtual Social Space (VSS) conceived to address these problems and to support the creation of a learning community for a Continuing Professional Distance Education (CPDE) Masters in IT Management. An action research approach was adopted to establish student needs, design and develop the site and to explore it with students. Initially received with enthusiasm and perceived as a good idea by the students, the VSS was not entirely successful. This paper discusses how characteristics of this cohort had an impact on students' perception and usage of this social space to create a learning community.
