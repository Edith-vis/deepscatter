4b2d226b7ecddc25c2b348fb797a6921ab1f3d6d	decision support for smart ecosystem evolution		In practice, there is the trend towards the development of increasingly complex software ecosystems consisting of information as well as embedded systems. The development and evolution of such ecosystems is challenging because of the involvement of a multitude of organizations providing software or hardware components on the ecosystem's platform. Therefore, for the purpose of deriving requirements towards the future development of the ecosystem and its platform, the gaining of insights into the eco-system is crucial as well as difficult. In my research, I work on the creation of an understanding of information needs in the context of smart ecosystems to build dedicated representations that support the ecosystem evolution. In this paper, I present results of an initial consideration of related work and give an outline of my planned future research including expected contributions, along with a summary of the status of the work done so far.	citizen science;data acquisition;data model;decision support system;embedded system;holism;information needs;internet explorer;koch snowflake;living lab;michael j. fischer;requirement;requirements engineering;software ecosystem;software engineering;software quality;systematic review;usability;wario land: shake it!

As a case study, we use social and welfare services within Indiana's Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA). The FSSA is composed of dozens of autonomous and geographically distant departments. Each department provides several rehabilitation programs to help disadvantaged citizens. It also contains a myriad of databases that store government and citizens information. We propose a framework that enables uniform access to a large number of government services and databases. A Web-based prototype called WebDG (Web Digital Government) has been implemented. The main features of WebDG are the following:	web service	Athman Bouguettaya;Brahim Medjahed;Abdelmounaam Rezgui;Mourad Ouzzani;Zhaoyang Wen	2002			public relations;business;services computing;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-73.11303383896573	-5.949700299804686	49103

We discuss two opposing types of standards: those based on SOAP, with tightly coupled designs similar to remote procedure calls, and those based on REST, with loosely coupled designs similar to the navigating of web links. We illustrate the standardization process, clarify the technical underpinnings of the conflict, and analyze the interests of stakeholders. The decision criteria for each group of stakeholders are discussed. Finally, we present implications for both the workflow and the wider Internet communities.	common criteria;complexity;decision analysis;formal verification;hudson;internet;loose coupling;machine to machine;orchard;remote procedure call;representational state transfer;soap;venue (sound system);virtual community;web service	Michael zur Muehlen;Jeffrey V.

1758a412edc14a0088cdaa08c5dcb15d0d416ad9	building national infrastructures for patient-centred digital services		Patient-centred digital services are increasingly gaining impact in the healthcare sector. The premise is that patients will be better equipped for taking care of their own health through instant access to relevant information and by enhanced electronic communication with healthcare providers. One initiative to provide such services to patients is the Danish national e-health portal, sundhed.dk, which is at the forefront of governmental initiatives and which serves as a unified hub between the various participants in the healthcare sector. Studying the evolution of sundhed.dk in light of information infrastructure theory, we highlight the enabling and constraining dynamics when designing and building a national infrastructure for patient-centred digital services. Furthermore, we discuss how such infrastructures can accommodate further development of services. The findings show that the Danish national e-health portal successfully managed to establish a solid foundation by means of providing direct usefulness and by building on existing information systems, routines, and governance structures in the healthcare sector. However, during this process, a number of unintended side effects appeared that have challenged the continuous development of the portal. We conclude that sundhed.dk needs to strike a balance between generativity and control to accommodate further development of services.	care-of address;information system;microsoft forefront;side effect (computer science);usb hub	Anne Thorseng;Tina Blegind Jensen	2015				HCI	-75.31568310780027	-4.159078610633325	49538

Components of a model of knowledge management leadership with a focus on knowledge sharing and innovative value creation in STPs are developed inspired by the work of Nonaka, Nahapiet and Ghoshal, Guns and others. Collection of data on various relevant measures is ongoing, covering technology firms and STPs in Singapore and other Asian countries. Besides outlining model components and hypotheses, tentative findings of qualitative interviews and survey work (with a focus on KM leadership in Singapore’s STPs) are presented aimed at identifying strategic ingredients for the creation of intelligent STPs with a conducive culture of R&D works and innovation as well as synergistic collaboration between tenant firms.	knowledge management;synergy	Thomas Menkhoff;Chay Yue Wah;Benjamin C Loh;Hans-Dieter Evers	2006	Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'06)	10.1109/HICSS.2006.150	knowledge base;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;technology management;management science;management;information technology;science, technology and society	Robotics	-77.33593510303872	1.8443106648676044	49561

All facilities are connected by one network, and served by one systems department. This has many advantages, including equipment and software upgraded on a regular schedule. It also presents some challenges, such as implementing or adapting policies developed to address needs and concerns of the main library. The general context is illustrated by descriptions of the situations in each of the three branches.	centralized computing;library (computing)	Jeanne M. Brown;Jennifer L.

We present emerging findings from our qualitative, social science study of a radio astronomy group developing software pipelines as they produce a data processing infrastructure. This paper examines how these researchers co-produce data products and software pipelines to enact their research infrastructure. We investigate the work of co-producing data and software to illustrate that to better support data-intensive science, we need to understand the practices that enable and produce data products, software, and ultimately infrastructures.	data-intensive computing;pipeline (computing);pipeline (software)	Drew Paine;Charlotte P.

They seem as inevitable as death and taxes. The recent massive breach at JP Morgan - a bank with high security standards - is a worrisome continuation of the trend. Although some breaches are widely covered in newspapers, many occur at small firms that get little attention. To put it in perspective, according to Privacy Clearinghouse (www.privacy rights.org), more than 4,400 data breaches have been recorded in the US since 2005, exposing nearly one billion records. Why are we seeing so many breaches? Why aren't firms protecting their data more aggressively? And, what can we do about it? These questions aren't new. California passed the data breach notification law in 2003. However, it seems that, in the US, neither firms nor policymakers have made much progress. Therefore, it's a good time to revisit some economic and policy fundamentals of data breaches. My goal here is to offer a broad framework to highlight various tradeoffs and the intuition behind them.	continuation;data breach;morgan;security breach notification laws	Rahul Telang	2015	IEEE Security & Privacy	10.1109/MSP.2015.12	public policy;investment;computer science;information security;data security;computer security;government	Security	-72.38995610529732	-9.409311557278533	50033

In this context, a core challenge is the patient identification in a heterogeneous system of diverse ICT solutions. This article presents first approaches how to solve problems arising from insufficient patient identification, both from a single actor’s perspective as well as the health network perspective. In a first step, organisation internal as well as cross-organizational mechanisms for patient identification are presented. In a second step, systematic and integrated strategies are discussed. This paper concludes with an outlook on future research questions in this field.	information logistics;informational self-determination;microsoft outlook for mac	Tobias Mettler;René Fitterer;Peter Rohner	2007			public relations;medicine;knowledge management;management science	HCI	-76.79184682352555	-3.6207414731244687	50042

In this paper we examine eleven years of research on electronic marketplaces in leading journals. The research articles are classified according to whether they focus on electronic markets theory; whether they take a system perspective and focus on the technology or functionality of the system; whether they investigate adoption and implementation issues, or organisational issues. The analysis of the literature highlights two distinct issues that researchers in the discipline need to address. The first is the lack of research on the fundamental questions on the nature of electronic markets and their efficiency. If information systems research does not address this question then it will not be seen as tackling critical issues by those outside of the discipline. The second is the relative lack of papers on the organisational implications of adopting and managing electronic marketplaces. These include, the organisational benefits, costs and risks of trading through e-marketplaces and strategies and methodologies for managing organisational participation. Both issues can be addressed by increasing the number of macro studies examining efficiencies in electronic markets.	electronic markets;information systems research;information system;online marketplace;systems theory	Susan Standing;Craig Standing;Peter E.

For the purpose of this research, a confined construction site is defined as a site where permanent works fit the site footprint, extending to levels above and/or below ground level, leaving spatial restrictions for other operations (e.g. plant and material movements, materials storage and temporary accommodation etc.) and require effective resource co-ordination beyond normal on-site management input. A literature review and analysis, case studies incorporating interviews and focus groups, and a questionnaire survey were used in order to gain a comprehensive insight into the issues of management of personnel in a confined construction site environment. The following are the top five leading issues highlighted; (1) Accidents due to an untidy site, (2) One contractor holding up another because of the lack of space, (3) A risk to personnel because of vehicular traffic on-site, (4) Difficult to facilitate several contractors at one work location, and (5) Numerous personnel working within the one space. In todayâ€™s modern environment, spatial restrictions are quickly becoming the norm in the industry. Therefore, the management of personnel on-site becomes progressively more difficult with the decrease in available space on-site. Where such environments exist, acknowledging the numerous issues highlighted above, aids site management in the supervision and co-ordination of personnel on-site, thus reducing accidents, increasing productivity and increasing profit margins. As on-site management professionals successfully identify, acknowledge and counteract the numerous issues illustrated, the successful management of personnel on a confined construction site is achievable. By identifying the numerous issues, on-site management can proactively mitigate such issues through adopting counteractive measures and through successful identification of the traits identified.

Within the aviation industry, the need for sustainable change is becoming more and more critical due to increasing commercial pressure, upcoming regulations and accelerating cycles of new technologies. But, whilst there is wide acceptance that change is necessary, the evidence is scant both in terms of empirical academic work and industrial-based case studies. Addressing the very real challenges industry has in implementing sustainable change was the key focus of the MAnaging System Change in Aviation (MASCA) project. MASCA was a three-year FP7 collaborative project funded by the European Union that finished in December 2013. The project was driven by the following four industry change initiatives:	while	Siobhán Corrigan;Nick McDonald	2014	Cognition, Technology & Work	10.1007/s10111-014-0308-9	engineering;knowledge management;engineering management;emerging technologies;operations research;aviation;european union	SE	-72.42789081580412	-5.677542174427873	51269
9fdbb912ede5d7c503d2fb3bfc982c8397918187	social media use in decision making: special issue of decision support systems for the 10th workshop on e-business		New advances of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) continue to rapidly transform how business is done and change the role of information systems in business and our daily life. Recognizing and theoretically interpreting these changes have been a major objective of the Annual Workshop on E-Business in the past ten years. The 10th Annual Workshop on E-Business (Web 2011) was held in Shanghai International Convention Center on Dec. 4, 2011. The workshop provides an open forum for e-business researchers and practitioners worldwide to explore and respond to research challenges, share the latest research findings, explore novel ideas, discuss success stories and lessons learned, and collectively chart future research directions. Among papers submitted to Web 2011, we selected a number of them based on original review results and invited their authors to extend those papers for this special issue. After two rounds of review, the following four papers are accepted for publication in this special issue. Although they focus on different research problems, they all involve big data and social media. The amount of data in our world has been exploding. Enterprises are flooded with ever-growing data of all types, easily amassing terabytes, even petabytes, of data. Analyzing such so-called big data is becoming a keystone of competition, newwaves of productivity growth, and innovation. Big data are more than simply a matter of size. With the emergence of new data collection technologies and advanced data mining and analytical tools, big data offer an unprecedented opportunity to discover insights in new and emerging types of data, to make businesses more agile, and to answer questions that were previously considered beyond reach. In their paper entitled “Understanding the Paradigm Shift to Computational Social Science in the Presence of Big Data,” Chang, Kauffman, and Kwon discuss the emergence of big data and how big data are supporting a research paradigm shift — the move to computational social science. They examine the data spectrum, ranging from a macro level to meso and micro levels, propose to use interdisciplinary research approaches to extracting meaningful information from large data sets, and share their insights on how the new paradigm may affect research methodologies. At the end of the paper, the authors introduce a number of future research directions with the new paradigm, including exploring the impacts of knowledge about contextual awareness, reassessing the business value of personalization and extending the study to consumer and firm co-informedness, and pursuing big data studies that focus on patterns, explanations and predictions of events in business, consumer and social insight settings, etc.	agile software development;big data;computation;computational social science;data mining;decision support system;electronic business;emergence;information system;keystone effect;mesoscopic physics;our world;personalization;petabyte;programming paradigm;security awareness;social media;terabyte	Dongsong Zhang;Wei Thoo Yue	2014	Decision Support Systems	10.1016/j.dss.2013.08.007	r-cast;decision support system;intelligent decision support system;decision analysis;decision engineering;knowledge management;management science;operations research;business decision mapping	DB	-67.94954176353377	-4.814672120682799	51321

As a result, they tend to develop new products and processes faster than the `̀ traditional'' US firm. Shows that nonJapanese high-technology firms that adopt Japanese-style networks tend also to develop new products and processes faster than their competitors. 296 Journal of Knowledge Management Volume 3 .

More specifically, they tend to develop new products and introduce new processes faster than competitors in their own industrial group. We used a sample of high-technology firms in Texas to test this hypothesis. Although many studies have been done on the effects of adopting the Japanese system on the performance of firms, many of these studies have concentrated on only one industry, mainly the automobile industry (see Helper, 1990, 1991, 1993; Helper and Sako, 1995; Dyer, 1996). To our knowledge, no previous study has analyzed the impact of Japanese-style networks across industries characterized as high technology. Thus, we ask whether US hightechnology firms that have adopted Japanesestyle networks show a higher speed of innovation than those that have not. The remainder of this paper will be divided as follows: (1) a section describing the effects on firms' innovations of Japanese information flows versus the US system; (2) a section presenting some empirical results on the relationship between innovations and Japanese-style networks for high-technology firms in Texas; and (3) a section giving some conclusions and guides for future research. Knowledge flows and innovations in the Japanese firm and the `̀ traditional'' US firm Freeman (1994), citing Stiglitz (1987) and Lundvall (1992), indicates that the picture that emerges from numerous studies of innovation in firms is one of continuous interactive learning that occurs in the context of formal and informal relationships between firms. Interfirm collaboration is an important source of knowledge; it enhances organizational learning and provides timely access to new information and resources that are otherwise unavailable, while also testing internal expertise and learning capabilities (Hamel, 1991; Dodgson, 1993; Powell et al., 1996; Arora and Gambardella, 1994). Consequently, the degree to which firms learn and increase their stock of knowledge is a function of the extent of their participation in network activities (Levinthal and March, 1994; Brown and Duguid, 1991; Von Hippel, 1988). Organizational learning is, however, a function of access to both knowledge and the firm's capability to utilize and build on that knowledge (Powell et al., 1996). Freeman (1994) pointed out that a lot of the discussion on networks as learning organizations relates to Japanese firms[1]. And some analysts, notably Aoki (1986; 1990), regard the Japanese firm as a specific form of industrial organization differing in many important characteristics from US and European firms. A widespread consensus has emerged since the second half of the 1980s on some key characteristics of the technological behavior of Japanese firms compared with those of the USA (Westney, 1993) ± including a consensus that Japanese firms had been faster to develop new products than their US counterparts. Clark et al. (1987), in their analysis of development times for Japanese, European and US firms in the auto industry, found that Japanese firms had a clear advantage over both their European and US counterparts. Bolton et al. (1994) also suggested that the organization of innovations in the Japanese semiconductor equipment industry has accelerated their development of new technology and led to their extraordinarily rapid worldwide market penetration. Mansfield (1988) showed that Japanese firms devote a much greater amount of resources than US firms to reduce the time taken to develop and introduce an innovation. The Japanese system has important implications for the innovation performance of firms (Imai et al., 1985; Aoki, 1990). Shorter product development is the result of a different organization of production than the one associated with the `̀ traditional'' US firm. In particular, it is an organization based on a greater flow of information both within the manufacturing establishment and with other firms, including suppliers and customers (Imai et al., 1985; Nonaka, 1990). In the Japanese firm, the supplier of important parts participates in the development processes of the prime manufacturer at an early phase. In fact, the design and the pilot fabrication of new parts are done parallel to corresponding activities at the prime manufacturer. The early involvement of the supplier in the development of new products 297 Knowledge flows in innovation networks Elsie L. Echeverri-Carroll Journal of Knowledge Management Volume 3 .

Interfirm coordination is also facilitated because engineers from important supplier firms are housed in the development laboratory of the prime manufacturer as `̀ guest engineers'' or participate in the prime manufacturer team on a permanent basis (Aoki, 1990). This considerably shortens the lead time necessary for the development of new products. According to Aoki (1990), early collaboration and exchange of information between firms in the development of new products only occurs once the supplier has developed expertise specific to the manufacturer network, which means that firms have been working together for a while. The innovative performance of a firm is linked to the extent that the firm and its suppliers make human asset-specific investments and, furthermore, that investments in human specificity (e.g. dedicated engineers) could have a substantial impact on increasing quality and reducing new model cycle times (Dyer 1994, 1996; Asanuma, 1989). It is in this sense that network systems defined by long-term relationships are essential to innovation. Human asset specificity refers to transaction-specific know-how accumulated by transactors through long-standing transactor relationships (e.g. dedicated supplier engineers who learn the systems, procedures and individuals that are idiosyncratic to the buyer) (Williamson, 1979). Human co-specialization increases as transactors develop experience working together and accumulate specialized information, language and know-how that allow them to communicate efficiently and effectively (Dyer, 1996). The Japanese practice is to award an open-ended contract which will continue on a permanent basis unless the supplier does not perform (Yokokura, 1984; Sako, 1992). Networks offer a competitive advantage, in terms of innovations, particularly in industries characterized by short product cycles and rapid market changes. Teece (1981), for instance, points out that high levels of uncertainty regarding the technical characteristics of rapidly evolving products or processes may permit inroads for opportunistic recontracting by an arm's length exchange partner. Consequently, firms establish collaborative arrangements to facilitate the transfer of tacit (experiential) knowledge, of the sort frequently involved in the innovation process, which is too difficult for arm's length exchange partners to transfer across organizational boundaries. The longevity of the Japanese relationships stands in stark contrast to the short-term relationships supported by the `̀ traditional'' US firm. In the `̀ traditional'' US firm, it is customary to award parts supply contracts on an annual basis. Thus, relationships between firms are performed in the context of an open market where price is the sole means of coordination (Womack et al., 1990). The relationship between firms is based on bidding on the lowest price for components. This one-time nature of transactions inhibits the continuous interaction needed for the development of network-specific expertise and slows down the pace of innovations. Womack et al. (1990, p. 142) describe some problems associated with putting together about 25 parts for a new automobile seat being produced by arm's length suppliers: When the parts were finally put together in the finished seat, it was not surprising that a piece would not fit or that two abutting materials will prove incompatible. For example, they might rattle or squeak in cold weather because of different expansion coefficients. In short, arm's length relationships restrict the transfer of technical knowledge between two related industries and seriously erode the ability of both to gain the requisite knowledge to quickly create the next generation of products (Teece, 1981; Von Hippel, 1988; Bolton et al., 1994). It is important to recognize that benefits associated with network organizations are not unique to the Japanese firm, but to all firms (including US firms) that organize their relationships with other firms based on the same principles: long-term tenure and a continuous exchange of information, allowing for the development of relation-specific (or network-specific) expertise. Do high-technology firms that adopt Japanese-style networks innovate faster than their competitors? We chose Markusen et al.'s (1986) definition of high-tech, which is based on the percentage of high `̀ human capital'' jobs in an industry. 	carroll morgan (computer scientist);coefficient;helper class;hubert dreyfus's views on artificial intelligence;ibm 3270;international standard serial number;job stream;knowledge management;knowledge-based systems;learning organization;network operating system;new product development;next-generation network;nonlinear gameplay;open collaboration;partial template specialization;pilot ace;powell's method;qualitative comparative analysis;rattle gui;sako (programming language);semiconductor;sensitivity and specificity;squeak;while;word lists by frequency	Elsie L.

The required cooperation may lead to a complex network including several of the thousands public administrations, enterprises and citizens on the different federal layers of a single country. Key challenge for achieving smooth end-to-end processes in such setting is a proper management of information exchanges at the interfaces between networked actors, as it is the exchange of information that glues together separated chunks of a process. This article conceptualizes the digital information assets residing at the interfaces between the different actors as IT-based boundaries objects. It further reports on a design research process that was initiated by the German Federal Ministry of Interior, which felt the need for a nationwide management method for those IT-based boundary objects. The achieved method extends the BOMOS framework as developed by the Dutch government and adopted by the European Commission. Notably, the method assists in designing and maintaining IT-based boundary objects while it takes horizontal and vertical division of competences in federal legislative and administrative structures into account. The main contributions of this article are the description of the method, the demonstration of its application, and an evaluation of its utility.	complex network;digital data;end-to-end principle	Erwin Folmer;Marcel Heddier;Martin Matzner;Michael Räckers;Jörg Becker	2014			public relations;social science;information exchange;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;database;management science;informatics;management;world wide web;information system;standardization	HCI	-74.79202221108977	-5.765191440022262	51603
7eaedaafa9c7d925309de9d2a316e1d08567982c	towards information security education 3.0 - a call for information security educational ontologies		The need for information security ”know-how” has permeated to all aspects of modern society. Nowadays, information security is no longer a problem faced by organizational users alone. Individuals often use online services in cyberspace on a daily basis for activities ranging from personal banking to social networking. The need to educate users regarding secure behavior in cyberspace has subsequently also become well established. This paper firstly argues that approaches towards such ”cyber-security” education should be based on the same Web 2.0 philosophies and paradigms that made the use of the Web in daily life so popular. Finally the paper briefly discusses the need for future research to enable such an approach towards information security education.	computer security;cyberspace;e-services;information security;internet;ontology (information science);semantic web;subject matter expert turing test;web 2.0;world wide web	Johan Van Niekerk;Ryan G.

Standardizing processes and procedures is also essential to achieve effective cooperation in cross-border and cross-community environments. The number of standards development organizations and the number of published information security standards have increased in recent years, creating significant challenges. Nations are using standards to meet a variety of objectives, in some cases imposing standards that are competing and contradictory, or excessively restrictive and not interoperable. Other standards favor companies that are already dominant in their field. The European Union, with the support of ENISA, has started to include standards in its strategies and policies, but much remains to be done. The development and use of standards is necessary, timely, and requires the involvement of public and private sector actors working in tandem.	computer security;information security;interoperability	Steve Purser	2014		10.3233/978-1-61499-372-8-97	control system security;information security standards;interoperability;security analysis;security service;computer security;european union;cloud computing security;business;private sector	Security	-73.13887053902036	-8.459468633013147	53365

Experience has shown that economic development activities like tourism, when they are driven by outsiders (notably transnational corporations), are likely to deplete the cultural and social capital that is necessary for sustainable community economic development. It is assumed instead that to the extent that insiders are empowered and enabled to bridge cross-cultural differences, tourism development strategies may contribute towards global sustainability. Establishing cultural empathy between players in the travel industry is crucial in this process. However, this vision needs to be grounded in a sound business model for the heritage enterprise. To this aim, local narratives should be translated into compelling e-content to be diffused globally.	social capital	Frank Go;Ronald M. Lee;Antonio P.

Within our research project Shaping Future, we applied this key feature and developed a methodology for the purpose of setting need-oriented research agendas in the field of human-machine interaction. Our current results suggest that methods of participatory design can be invaluable for co-determining research trajectories and co-setting research agendas. By promoting interaction on equal terms and transcending terminology barriers, these methods can help re-orient science and technology development toward public preference. In view of the dynamic evolution of participatory design, our project can help uncover new research fields and develop new approaches to technology development.

We begin by exploring the challenges that displaced persons and aid organizations face throughout three key stages of displacement – flight from conflict zones, temporary displacement, and long term integration. On this basis we analyze how the Estonian e-Governance infrastructure can be used in a refugee emergency. We provide a definition of intangible e-Governance infrastructure. We identify the key component of the existing Estonian e-Governance infrastructure as well as the proposed Governmental Cloud and Data Embassy initiatives. We analyze linkages where the utilization of the infrastructure could potentially counter the challenges of displaced persons and aid organizations. To realize these linkages, we propose a policy to make certain refugee-related, otherwise restricted governmental datasets accessible to international aid organizations. Additionally, we introduce a legal framework for the policy, analyze the technological requirements of its implementation, and discuss its communicational and technology export-related implications.	best, worst and average case;continuous operation;displacement mapping;e-governance;real life;requirement;worst-case scenario	Lörinc Thurnay;Benjamin Klasche;Katrin Nyman-Metcalf;Ingrid Pappel;Dirk Draheim	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-64248-2_17	e-governance;environmental resource management;business;refugee;cloud computing;displaced person;estonian	HCI	-75.09622146816612	-4.196560815846405	53969

This paper describes the results from the use of a computer-based process for accreditation at the farm level. This study of the pattern of use of such a system enables both the fine-tuning and continued deployment of this system, and the appropriate design of similar schemes. The use of the system increased the quality of a set of accreditation documents while reducing the development time from six months to less than two hours.	technical support	Samuel Mann;Ian Brown	1999			computer science;engineering;new zealand studies	HCI	-72.77332943520514	-6.044676358996024	54276

77f80e3a57c6df3b8495d7d77306b8a71d1ff9f3	the government information locator service: a user-based approach to standards	location service	n There are two basic approaches to information systems deSiBII and evaiuation. There is the “technological approach,” in which the technoioqy drives the size, shape, function, and even the content of an information system; here the taChnOlOgy itself-its performance and its outputs-is the object of evaluation. The second approach is “user-based” and looks to user behaviors to develop functional and design requirements for the information system. An evaluation of information systems from a user perspective looks primarily at how well the information system serves the needs of the user. Information teChnOiOqy I’elieS on the extensive use of technical standards for its successful operation. Those standards, which are fundamental to the exlstence of the increasingly interconnected and inteqrated information environments enabled by electronic networks, are deeply embedded in the technoieqy. This is nowhere more true than In PC technology, which includes standardized keyboards, file formats, connectors, disk form factors, and communications schema. All these standards make the advanced technology of the new Intel chips saleable; all are necessary to advance the technology of a Microsoft or of a UNIX operating system. The standards are not only embedded, they are assumed and expected. e want to explore what a user-based approach to the development of information technology standards might offer. Given the emergence of user-based perspectives on information technology design and implementation, if standards are embedded in information technology, the logical question to ask is whether a user-based approach to system design can be divorced from the idea of a user-based approach to standards development. We argue that such an approach may be possible and identify relationships between the users and the standards development process. Based on our experience in a recent research project’ dealing with a specific standards development activity, we attempt to identify how users and their needs may be incorporated into information technology standards. We propose a preliminary model for standards development based on the assumption that developing a profile is a stage in the standards development process (i.e., for open systems standards). We think it is necessary to address the issue of “who are the users,” and we propose several classes of users that may help to conceptualize a user-based approach to standards development. The goal of the research project was to advance the development of the Government Information Locator Service (GUS) and its use of ANSI/NE0 239.50. For us, however, the project also provided an opportunity to investigate the intersection of user requirements, standards development, and standards-based solutions to user needs.	computer form factor;embedded system;emergence;information system;list of intel chipsets;online locator service;operating system;requirement;systems design;technical standard;unix;user requirements document	William E.

The first paper, “Brent prices and oil stock behaviors: evidence from Nigerian listed oil stocks”, by Amarachi Uzo-Peters, Temitope Laniran and Adeola Adenikinju, investigates the impact of Brent oil price shocks on oil related stocks in Nigeria. The second paper, “Valueat-risk under ambiguity aversion”, by Rossella Agliardi, offers a new perspective to full awareness on capital requirement calculation as requested by international regulation. The third paper, “Climate change and financing adaptation by farmers in northern Nigeria”, by Terfa W. Abraham and William M. Fonta, shows that rural farmers are affected by climate change through increased temperature, prolonged dry seasons, floods, and drought, which lead to low harvest and, in turn, low income. The fourth paper, “Does financial depth impact economic growth in North Cyprus?”, by Turgut Türsoy and Faisal Faisal, shows that economic growth can be improved by enhancing the deposit rates in the financial system.The fifth paper, “Impact of global financial crunch on financially innovative microfinance institutions in South Asia”, by Faisal Mustafa, Ambreen Khursheed and Maham Fatima, evaluates the role of a country’s political practices in moderating the impact of global financial crunch on microfinance performance. The sixth paper, “Is money going digital? An alternative perspective on the current hype”, by Daniel Gersten Reiss, proposes that the statuses of electronic money (e-money) and banknotes have switched in the view of monetary authorities.	acclimatization;anartia fatima;behavior;droughts;economic growth;financial times;floods;funding;money;paper;poverty;request - action;risk aversion;rossella cf. vanhoeffeni sv-2011;shock;tenth	Gang Kou	2002	Psychodynamic psychiatry	10.1521/pdps.2012.40.4.543		NLP	-76.43193307635458	-7.475438272766396	54603

Thus, coins emerged in response to a set of challenges in barter and gift exchange. The development of paradigms for trade and exchange continues today, and is accelerating due both to crises in the mainstream global economy, and to new possibilities enabled by information technology. In this discussion paper, we consider alternative and complementary currency and exchange innovations, including local/community currencies, timebanks, crypto-currencies, and person-to-person collaborative economy microenterprises, as a technology design space for currency and exchange. We consider the consequences and trajectories of the rapidly evolving currency ecosystem, particularly with respect to research and development opportunities for CSCW.	computer-supported cooperative work;ecosystem;green paper;peer-to-peer;sharing economy	John M.

cdfa09368cdc30d1369cfced194b1daa7a652d32	the organization and business model of a software virtual community in china		With the increasing pervasiveness of communication among networked computers, scholars and practitioners alike recognize the  value added of Internet based technical forums for enabling work in distributed communities (Hildreth and Kimble, 2000) and  networks of practice (Brown and Duguid, 2001). China in particular is an interesting environment to explore the significance  and role of specialised technical forums for software development beyond the firm boundary. Internet service providers’ set  up privately owned technical forums and software engineers join voluntarily such virtual communities for sharing information  and knowledge. The organization and business model of such forums however has attracted very little research interest so far.  Using a case study approach we present in this paper, the organization and business model of China Software Developer Net,  one of the most successful Internet engineering communities in China with more than eight hundred thousands members in 2004.  We also discuss how the system design and business model of CSDN service provider has helped to build up a sustainable distributed  community and network of practice and creating a dynamic culture for extending information and knowledge sharing much beyond  organisational boundaries.  	industrial and organizational psychology;virtual community	Jie Yan;Dimitris Assimakopoulos	2005		10.1007/0-387-29360-4_43	business model;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;marketing;business software;business process modeling;business activity monitoring	HCI	-76.06854023294382	3.6006434786714223	54845

We find a positive effect of network externalities on price in this market that is similar to markets for spreadsheet and web server software as shown previously (Brynjolfsson and Kemerer [E. Brynjolfsson, and C. Kemerer Network externalities in microcomputer software: an econometric analysis of the spreadsheet market, unpublished draft, MIT Sloan School of Management, (1997)]; Gallaugher and Wang [J.M.

Gandal, Hedonic price indexes for spreadsheets and an empirical test for network externalities, Rand Journal of Economics 25 (1) (Spring 1994)]). As observed in other software pricing studies, we find strong brand effects among word processors. However, quality attributes do not significantly impact price in this market. This is contrary to the evidence from studies of spreadsheet software. Furthermore, in contrast to the evidence from spreadsheets, prices adjusted for quality show an upward trend over time in the market for word processing software. D 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Cybersecurity processes and techniques are increasingly critical to our warfighting missions, but they can also inhibit the pace and potential for high impact, game-changing innovation. Throughout its history, the Navy has shown the ability of innovation (in policy, process, and technology) to change the game when our security is on the line. We believe the Navy is capable of dramatically impacting not only the U.S. capabilities in cyber conflict and information operations, but also in cyber defense and information assurance, as well as cybersecurity for our society. While cyber risk management is challenging, the Navy’s transition from DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) to the Risk Management Framework (RMF) has the potential to harmonize our cybersecurity efforts with our need (and demonstrated ability to provide) for game-changing strategies, tactics, and technologies. We offer a foundation for the foregoing assertions and recommendations on ways to encourage innovation in the context of effective cyber risk management.	computer security;cyber security standards;department of defense information assurance certification and accreditation process;eclipse requirements modeling framework;risk management framework	Craig Jackson;Robert Templeman	2016	CoRR		simulation;environmental resource management;management;computer security	Security	-72.14726659616565	-5.969823470001046	55100

Medicaid, a state-run, federally-matched government program which accounts for roughly one-quarter of all healthcare expenses in the US, has been particularly susceptible targets for fraud in recent years. With escalating overall healthcare costs, payers, especially government-run programs, must seek savings throughout the system to maintain reasonable quality of care standards. As such, the need for effective fraud detection and prevention is critical. Electronic fraud detection systems are widely used in the insurance, telecommunications, and financial sectors. What lessons can be learned from these efforts and applied to improve fraud detection in the Medicaid health care program? In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature study to analyze the applicability of existing electronic fraud detection techniques in similar industries to the US Medicaid program.

This paper tests the relationship between three measures of scientific employment, and the population of U. S. metropolitan areas. Elasticities of scientific employment with respect to city size and nonlinear functions of city size suggest that innovative ability of the largest urban areas declined somewhat from 196 to 1972.

This has been especially true in fields of rapid technological and social change. Two of these areas, the computer and communications industries, have been the subject of increasing interest and examination in the past few years. The development of complex technological, regulatory, social and institutional interrelationships between these two industries and increasing recognition of their impact on the future of the economic, social, and political framework of modern nations has led to this intense interest. The future of these industries has been the subject of inquiry in both Canada and the United States by many governmental and institutional bodies as well as by groups within the affected industries.

Patents and publications data have been used as output indicators to map the R&D activities of South African universities. The study observed that universities are the most prolific publishers and constitute about 91% of total South African publications. However, universities altogether produce only about 14% of total South African patents. Only a few universities are responsible for both patenting and publication portfolio of South Africa. The collaboration patterns from joint patents show that only about 19% patents are collaborative patents. South African public research institutes are more active in joint patents with universities followed by the foreign universities but local firms are less active in collaborative patents. The similar trends are observed in co-authored articles also. The study recommends that collaboration between universities and local firms need to be strengthened to develop technological capabilities in South Africa. South African universities need to collaborate more with the industries, particularly the local industries or institutes to achieve the ‘entrepreneurial university’ in terms of patents and technology transfer.	software patent	Swapan Kumar Patra;Mammo Muchie	2018	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-018-2764-0	data mining;social network analysis;management;scientometrics;computer science;portfolio	HCI	-76.56474834255295	-6.725732010393314	56827

We examine the design of one of our research projects and describe how this mixed-design GT project helped elaborate emerging theories using slices of qualitative and quantitative data. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we show that the use of mixed data and techniques can be leveraged to help build credible theories in IS because it allows researchers to build theories of greater abstraction and scope: it helps sense-making in the drive from substantive to parsimonious formal theories; (ii) in line with classic GT, we propose a mixed typological design to help build a pathway to formal grounded theories in rupture with existing literature; and (iii) we highlight GT as a meta-theory of research design and revisit some of its main principles in a mixed-design perspective.

In this paper we motivate the cost reduction and increased effectiveness of advertising that is displayed and managed using digital signage networks as opposed to traditional signage. As an example, we describe a method for customizing advertising messages for particular demographics in different locations using dynamically configurable multimedia. We introduce a partially automated intermediary, namely the Digital Signage Exchange, which enables the formation of a virtual marketplace for display time on the digital signage network and facilitates collaboration between buyers and sellers. We present a concise representation for a customer’s order for display time on the digital signage network and an informal business transaction management model for the exchange. This model includes support for advance bulk purchase of blocks of display time. The model also provides information to enable a counter-offer to be made to the customer when an order cannot be completely fulfilled as requested. 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.	authorization;bluetooth;digital media;digital signage;encryption;experiment;internet;malware;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;scientific literature;venue (sound system);video display controller;wireless access point	John V.

With the fusion of IT and business strategy, Digital Business Strategy (DBS) creates the foundation for digital business models [1]. In this paper, we develop a DBS framework, based on a structured review of 21 industry reports. From this analysis, we yield 8 generic dimensions with a total of 40 critical success factors (CSFs) for DBS. The CSFs represent a rich set of actions specific to DBS and to the design of business models in the digital business environment. The discussion shows that academic research is lagging behind in contributing to DBS. Future research is suggested to further formalize the concept of DBS and to create a better understanding about how firms can successfully establish DBS.	capability maturity model;cost efficiency;digital rights management;digital strategy;direct-broadcast satellite;strategic management	Friedrich Holotiuk;Daniel Beimborn	2017			business model;business analysis;meta-analysis;business process reengineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business case;design strategy;management science;business system planning;technology strategy;business relationship management;new business development;business process modeling;line of business;business activity monitoring;business architecture	HCI	-69.71512862117007	2.9718152438583707	57819

6c41955a7968dba747a26dc1ae3163be305dc566	capabilities and challenges of contemporary service based monitoring systems		New technology developments have opened opportunities to obtain more data from more sources as well as to handle a larger variety of forms of data. This, in turn, raises the interest in data and information monitoring in different business and engineering contexts. Thus monitoring systems obtain the role of subsystems in contemporary information and knowledge systems. Taking into consideration the quest for agility of business and information systems, the flexibility offered by service systems motivates the consideration of service based monitoring systems. In this paper capabilities and challenges of service based monitoring systems are discussed by considering several issues of analysis.

2bd2761255a79c913e4ebbc01b3e52e1ab3a3caa	digital infrastructures as platforms: the case of smart electricity grids		Smart grids enable customers and utility providers to gain a better understanding of energy consumption and production, by adding a layer of digital data collection and analysis on existing electricity grids. As digital infrastructures they have distinct characteristics from earlier ‘pipeline’ infrastructures in that they can generate significant network effects that could lead to new opportunities for value creation across different stakeholders. Exactly because of these unique characteristics of digital infrastructures, we propose that they can be approached as platforms. With this conceptualization, we seek to explore what are the design and value propositions of a digital infrastructure. We provide answers to this question by synthesizing existing research on platforms and digital infrastructures. We explore the case of the emerging smart grid in South Africa and develop a set of design and value propositions. We discuss the relevance of our propositions to extant research on digital infrastructures and platforms, and explore opportunities for further research.	conceptualization (information science);digital data;relevance;smart tv	Mira Slavova;Panayiotis Constantinides	2017			digital data;knowledge management;conceptualization;electricity;value proposition;smart grid;energy consumption;computer science;extant taxon	HCI	-76.5511987284246	-6.0161357762390795	58243

We found that Fuji Xerox has chosen the “hybridization strategy” that mixes human‐based and IT‐based knowledge‐sharing techniques. We also argue that concurrent engineering provides not only efficiency benefits but also positive effects on group and organizational creativity. Finally we present a conceptual framework of “how concurrent engineering works”, i.e. uncertainty and diversity necessitate concurrency which produces such benefits as efficiency and creativity, and which in turn realizes product integrity.

The authors present logistics as the main channel of introduction to planning and organizing solidarity economy, seeking to show that the participation of Production Engineering leads to a breakage of some strains marked by neoliberalism, making evident the need of serious ecological concerns within the scope of the projects in that sector towards a cleaner production. The authors also point out the impossibility of development of solidarity economy programs without well mapped processes that include environmental impact evaluations and environmental education as pillars of sustainability in any development program.	industrial engineering	Nilo Costa Serpa;Ivanir Costa;Oduvaldo Vendrametto;Luiz de Oliveira Costa Neto	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-44736-9_4	construction engineering;political science;economic growth;economic system	DB	-72.99334867247954	-3.2952526086515617	58667

The third generation R&D supplies a more rational frame of action to reconcile several objectives which can turn out contradictory: dedicate enough resources to create new technologies, develop a wallet of industrial and academic co‐operation to accelerate the acquisition of new knowledge. The strategies of high‐tech firms succeed to create a great variety of knowledge. It is necessary to organize the diversity of the internal and external sources to use knowledge fully as a true competitive advantage. We show how the memory must be constituted of the firm to reach that point. From a study on several cases of MNC we characterize the difficulties of the capitalization of the knowledge, and then we present how the firms can take advantage of an active management of knowledge flows.

Much has been claimed and written about the influence of e-government on the modernization and growth of public sector initiatives in China. Little is known, however, about how e-government influence the financial accountability of the government. This paper presents a view of both challenges and advantages of implementing e-government in China since the 1999 budgetary reform. It combines the areas of e-government and accountability in the public sector and examines how closely and critically intertwined they may be.	e-government	Tian-Yi Chen;Xiao-Zhang Liu;Jing-Tao Fu	2010	2010 International Conference on E-Business and E-Government	10.1109/ICEE.2010.134	public relations;financial management;economics;public economics;marketing;finance;public sector;public administration;management;china	SE	-75.0207628299115	-7.784195045834809	60025

However, the rigour of such success studies has either not been analysed to an adequate degree or in case of the most prominent study, the Chaos Report, widely criticised. In order to ensure a sound research foundation, there is a need for assessing the quality of existing success reports. We conduct a systematic mapping study of IT project success reports and provide an overview and a critical evaluation of existing reports as a result. We enable scholars to more carefully and thoughtfully motivate their research and help practitioners to assess published success rates at their true worth. By pointing out strengths and critical weaknesses of existing success reports, we hope to contribute to more considerate future inquiries.	chaos;display resolution;foremost;holism;information system;type system;web search engine	Dirk Basten;Oleg Pankratz;Dominik Joosten	2013			computer science;knowledge management;management science;information system	SE	-76.54415225011601	-0.7055031734989917	60081

One of the key factors of KM is its dependence on a culture that will support KM activities. Some of the activities that are extremely culture dependent are the sharing and acceptance of knowledge between individuals and organizations. The question to be answered is whether U.S. federal government (hereafter referred to as “government”) organizations, which are notorious for the lack of this type of culture (although not all), can accomplish KM at all or just need a different approach that has not been defined previously? In this research, we will propose to use government initiatives to entice the organization into creating the culture needed for KM. We will also propose a way to effect changes in the culture by implementing a social initiative that has proven successful in other organizations. The combination of these two activities is expected to create a culture that is viable for KM to flourish even in the infamous government organization.	knowledge management	J.

Questions remain, whether study programs for public administration pick up the topic, how it is conceptualized and taught in order to develop e-government competencies. This article analyzes which fundamental conceptualizations of e-government underlie study programs for public administration in Germany and which e-government- and IT-related topics are taught. Against the background of two international study programs in e-government, the article discloses a parallelism of IT-related and non-IT-related topics within study programs, a technical bias in e-government programs, and outlines essentials for e-government education.	e-government;parallel computing;requirement	Sirko Hunnius;Benedikt Paulowitsch;Tino Schuppan	2015	2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2015.255	public relations;e-government;information science;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;software engineering;management;law	DB	-67.06177694956845	-6.151376580448772	60469

For example, the Transportation Security Administration in the Department of Homeland Security employs risk assessment particularly against groups considered “other.” Using the work of mostly European scholars, especially the literatures about Foucault's governmentality and Beck's risk society, the paper combines theory with empirical work by governmental agencies on transparency, secrecy, and risk assessment methods used in the Department of Homeland Security, providing insight into the securitization of the American state. Risk is a means to  futurize  threats to the polity, to create the security  imaginary , a  fictionalization  that creates a moral panic and a climate of fear in seeking to cope with uncertainty. With those limitations of risk in mind, we can question four important elements of risk in U.S. security practice: “connecting the dots”; the quantitative bases of risk assessment algorithms; how risk assessment tends to ignore the important if circular intentionality of terror; and the difficulties inherent in controlling populations by classification, especially other-ed populations. The paper concludes with suggestions about unmasking the uncertainty of risk assessment and enabling oversight of its practice by legislative, judicial, and public actors.	risk assessment	Philip Doty	2015	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2015.04.008	public relations;homeland security;risk factor;security studies;security management;actuarial science;economics;security convergence;computer science;threat;it risk;risk;sociology;enterprise risk management;public administration;management;law;computer security	Crypto	-73.07198568882845	-8.98067410660395	60531

But, only few contributions are exploring the financial flows associated with supply chains. This article reviews the state-of-the-art of research regarding financial flows in supply chains. In doing so, it becomes apparent that an explicit examination and optimisation of the cost of capital has been missing so far. In order to close this gap, a conceptual framework and a mathematical model of ‘‘Supply Chain Finance’’ is proposed. 1 Supply chain finance—research gap Supply chain management (SCM) is applied in today’s business world to optimise the flows of goods, information, and the financial flows within and between companies by functional and cross-company integration. In the past, academic papers regarding SCM mainly dealt with the design and optimisation of the flows of goods and information. The financial flows between companies of the supply chain, however, were often neglected and have only recently found greater attention in the academic SCM literature. This paper analyses the role of financial flows in supply chains and the impact SCM can have on optimising such flows in terms of capital cost. A framework for the financial aspects of SCM is developed. Furthermore, a mathematical model is proposed to explain financing activities across supply chains, which are referred to as ‘‘supply chain financing’’ (SCF). The basic idea of the model is that supply chain information can be used to decrease investment risks and thus capital costs of financing projects within supply chains. First, in this paper, supply chain flows are analysed, and the role of financial aspects are discussed on the basis of a preliminary review of related literature. It is shown that the cost of capital in supply chains has been mostly neglected so far. The following part of the discussion (Sect. 3) proposes a supply chain finance framework. It covers the objects, actors, and levers of supply chain financing. Finally, in part 4, a mathematical model is developed to better understand to what extent financial SCM can H.-C.

2625fc202685372e7bab34924b9ccf30e97da505	a survey: electronic voting development and trends		Any practitioner working on electronic voting (e-voting) seems to have different opinions on the main issues that seem to affect the area. On the one hand– given the criticality and the risk e-voting systems potentially pose to the democratic process–e-voting systems are permanently under a magnifying glass that amplifies any glitch, be it significant or not. On the other hand, given the interest e-voting raises within the general public, there seems to be a tendency to generalize and oversimplify. This tendency leads to attributing specific problems to all systems, regardless of context, situation, and actual systems used. Additionally, scarce know-how about the electoral context often contributes to make matters even more confused. This is not to say all e-voting systems show the security and reliability characteristics that are necessary for a system of such a criticality. On the contrary, a lot of work still has to be done. Starting from previous experiences and from a large-scale experiment we conducted in Italy, this paper provides some direction, issues, and trends in e-voting. Getting a clearer view of the research activities in the area, highlighting both positive and negative results, and emphasizing some trends could help, in our opinion, to draw a neater line between opinion and facts, and contribute to the construction of a next generation of e-voting machines to be safely and more confidently employed for elections.	criticality matrix;experience;glitch;next-generation network;self-organized criticality	Komminist Weldemariam;Adolfo Villafiorita	2010			magnifying glass;democracy;positive economics;glitch;criticality;electronic voting;computer science	HCI	-75.50660583790967	1.0688328839445658	60667

This study applied provincial panel data in China to empirically research the influence of agricultural producer services on agricultural structure adjustment, income of farmers and agricultural production efficiency. Results indicate that agricultural information, science and technology promotion significantly promote agricultural development. But from regional perspective, results show that there are geographical differences in the roles of different types of agricultural production service industry playing.

This paper presents a case study considering a brief theoretical reference and data collected through direct observations, interviews, internal documents and access to the systems and software used by COR. The analysis of the COR IT infrastructure and monitoring teams’ preparation for the Olympics revealed a successful development of new teams and conflict solving practice. Despite the use of different sources of information and the development of specific systems for the event, the COR preparation faced some restrictions in analytical functions, security and integration among systems. Nevertheless, regionalization for monitoring and interagency coordination, cross-agency instant messaging, and a team for active monitoring of social media emerged as new practices, representing opening venues for future research.	chain-of-responsibility pattern;iscram;instant messaging;risk management;social media;social network analysis;systems integrator;video content analysis;winsock	Ya-Nan Wei;Danielle K Kline;Zheng-Hua Liu;Hugo Tsugunobu Yoshida Yoshizaki;Paulo Gonçalves;Bryan Hellack	2017				AI	-73.90173992836293	-3.712919914330709	61304

Given the increased dependence of businesses on computer-based systems and networks, vulnerabilities of systems abound. Clearly, exclusive reliance on either the technical or the managerial controls is inadequate. Rather, a multifaceted approach is needed. In this paper, based on a panel presented at the 2007 Americas Conference on Information Systems held in Keystone, Colorado, we provide examples of failures in information security, identify challenges for the management of information systems security, and make a case that these challenges require new theory development via examining reference disciplines. We identify these disciplines, recognize applicable research methodologies, and discuss desirable properties of applicable theories.	americas conference on information systems;information security;keystone effect;management information system;mechatronics;theory;vulnerability (computing)	Joobin Choobineh;Gurpreet Dhillon;Michael R.

As a result of developing technologies and policy that make autonomy a feasible solution, at least three separate organizations are aiming to produce and sail their first autonomous ships by 2020. Thus it is essential to begin assessing their cyber-risk profiles in order to rank and mitigate any vulnerabilities. As existing risk models for physical ship safety and autonomous cars do not adequately represent the unique nature of cyber-threats for autonomous vessels within the maritime sector, this article applies a model-based risk assessment framework named MaCRA which had previous only been used to model existing ships, not those of the near-future.

However, people need to accommodate technical challenges in successful and secure content sharing. In particular, people have to manage access control policies that are both social and technical: deciding what to share and who to share it with, and how to technically effect their decisions. In this paper, we focus on the usability of access control: how people manage file sharing among various groups, organizations, and tasks. We present survey and interview data regarding content sharing and content protection, and discuss the implications for the design of networked collaboration tools.	access control;attachments;copy protection;email;file sharing;peer-to-peer;usability	Tara Whalen;Diana K.

In recent years, the BSC has been applied to information technology (IT). The IT BSC is becoming a popular tool with its concepts widely dispersed by international consultant groups such as GartnerGroup, Renaissance Systems, Nolan Norton Institute, and others. As a result of this interest, the first real-life applications are starting to emerge. In this paper, the development and implementation of an IT BSC within an Information Services Division (ISD) serving a Canadian financial group will be described and discussed. On the basis of this case study, a maturity model for the IT BSC is introduced and the necessary linkage between the business and IT scorecard is clarified.	binary symmetric channel;capability maturity model;kaplan–meier estimator;linkage (software);real life;renaissance	Wim Van Grembergen;Ronald Saull	2001		10.1109/HICSS.2001.927176	quality management;performance management;strategic planning;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;balanced scorecard;management;strategy map;information technology;capability maturity model	DB	-72.00774565592623	3.262513212209108	62081

Public administrations deliver documents to citizens and businesses—subpoenas, legal verdicts, notifications, administrative penalties, and so forth. However, official activities are more strongly bound to legal regulations than in civil law. Delivery of crucial and personal documents raises the demand for qualified identification and non-repudiation services as featured by registered and certified mail in the paper world. Legal requirements for electronic delivery carried out by public administrations (eDelivery) cannot be fulfilled by standard mailing systems. Although the requirements for eDelivery systems may differ due to national legal regulations, this paper discusses common requirements and properties on an abstract level. Moreover, the author shows how these requirements have been addressed by introducing the Austrian eDelivery system for eGovernment applications.	non-repudiation;requirement	Arne Tauber	2010	IJEA	10.4018/jea.2010010104	public relations;computer science;marketing;operations management;management;law;world wide web;computer security	SE	-74.32135590315715	-8.606386612987885	62089

We draw on a practice perspective to analyze the spanning practices of boundary shakers – mandated change agents – as they attempt to engage with others in crossboundary collaborative initiatives that aim at changes as part of the postmerger integration process. Our analysis suggests that some of the premerger practices were resilient at the end of the project. We suggest that one of the boundary shakers’ practices of boundary consolidation through discourses of authoritative knowledge and ‘group-making’ facilitated the construction of symbolic boundaries between the merging parties, thus contributing to the resilience of pre-merger practices.

e73340a707e8554dcc3d5cc95e07a5e2cae13680	building healthcare service navigation system for a local health integration network: a requirements elicitation model		Local health integration networks (LHIN) are not-for-profit organisations created by the Ontario government in 2006 for planning, identifying, integrating, and funding health services and priority programmes for their regions. This chapter discusses an information systems development initiative in 1 of the 14 LHINs with the objective of facilitating healthcare service navigation by users. These healthcare services are provided by 88 member agencies of the LHIN consisting of hospitals, long-term centres, assisted living services, community support services, community care access centres, mental health agencies, addiction agencies, and community health centres. Using the proposed service-oriented architecture for the LHIN as a basis of our framework, we suggest an ontology-based requirements elicitation model for developing an automated and interactive tool capable of supporting automatic service discovery, automatic service composition, and dynamic composition.	requirement;requirements elicitation	Gokul Bhandari	2011		10.1007/978-1-4614-4951-5_54	systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;requirements elicitation;transport engineering	Robotics	-64.38865103164477	2.8643360606542685	62522

Simulation modeling has the advantage of making a theory more precise and including relevant factors within broader boundaries (e.g. the use of multiple actors). This paper demonstrates how an agent-based simulation model can be developed to generate or test a theory in the context of the social amplification of risk. The challenges on model’s calibration and validation are highlighted.		Bhakti S. S.

This new regulation adopted in 2007 establishes a new philosophy in how to design environmental protection and health. For this reason, REACH appears as a privileged object of study to analyze the impact of regulation on innovation strategies of firms and the market structure. Our model focuses on the interactions between clients and suppliers in order to take into account interdependencies at the heart of vertical relationships that are upset by the new principles introduced by REACH. The main contribution of this paper is to show, through an agent-based model, how different combinations of flexible and stringent instruments designed on REACH regulation (Extended Producer Responsibility, authorization process and restrictions) create the incentives and the constraints to shape market selection and innovation.	agent-based model;authorization;industrial robot;interaction;interdependence	Nabila Arfaoui;Eric Brouillat;Maider Saint Jean	2013		10.5220/0004623705170528	engineering;marketing;operations management;management	AI	-71.70590740862384	-1.8012680183391667	62663

In this paper, the authors present a conceptual model for security governance from the perspective of decision rights allocation. Based on Da Veiga and Eloff's 2007 framework for security governance and two high-level information security documents published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST, the authors present seven domains of information security governance. For each of the governance domains, they propose a main decision type, using the taxonomy of information technology decisions defined by Weill and Ross 2004. This framework recommends the selection of decision rights allocation patterns that are proper to those decision types to ensure good security decisions. As a result, a balance can be achieved between decisional authority and responsibility for information security.	information governance;information security	Yu Andy Wu;Carol Stoak Saunders	2011	IRMJ	10.4018/irmj.2011010103	information security audit;computer security model;standard of good practice;public relations;actuarial science;security convergence;information governance;computer science;knowledge management;environmental resource management;information security;information security standards;corporate security;network security policy;computer security;enterprise information security architecture;information security management	AI	-71.0807978453543	-6.693120615325123	63450

a9a3d22d1f29d604439b753a63b28ff5769372f5	sustaining it pmos during cycles of global recession		Growth in the number of PMOs established by the industry over last decade and ever growing body of literature on PMO related research in academia is a clear indication that there is very clear interest of researchers, practitioners and industries across the globe to understand and explore value propositions of PMO. However, there is still a lack of consensus on many critical aspects of PMOs. While there are many PMOs being established, but there are also many being closed and disbanded, which is definitely a matter of concern. In industry environment, a narrow majority of PMOs are well-regarded by their organizations and are seen as contributing business value, many of the others “are still struggling to show value for money and some are failing, causing a high mortality rate among PMOs”. This paper is the result of a study undertaken to get a deeper understanding of factors that may be causing mortality and failure of PMOs. Post Implementation Reviews of 4-failed & 3-challenged PMOs in IT-Industry were carried out with concerned Project Managers & PMO-staff, using grounded theory research method, with support from the concerned enterprise from IT-Industry.	capability maturity model;failure;feedback;iteration;multi-level governance;pmos logic;semiconductor industry;strategic management	Parvez Mahmood Khan;Mirza Mohd.

This paper analyzes the effects that standardization has in the attitudes and values as regard to innovation for a sample of firms by text-mining their corporate disclosures. Changes in the relevance of the concepts, co-word networks and emotion analysis have been employed to conclude that the effects of certification on the corporate behavior about innovation are coincident with the open innovation and transversalization concepts that UNE 166002 promotes.	open innovation;relevance;text mining;unbundled network element	Gaizka Garechana;Rosa María Río-Belver;Iñaki Bildosola;Marisela Rodríguez Salvador	2017	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-017-2345-7	text mining;innovation management;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;data mining;management;sentiment analysis	ML	-73.11194810902377	-2.6466360136055327	64313

Through two surveys and a set of semi-structured interviews— targeting both developers and policy makers—we identified key stakeholders, organizations, and FOSS projects, be they rooted in industry, academia, or public policy space that influence software and security practices in the energy sector. We explored FOSS tools, common attitudes and concerns, and challenges with regard to FOSS adoption. More than a dozen themes were identified from interviews and surveys. Of these, drivers for adoption and risks associated with FOSS were the most prevalent. More specifically, the misperceptions of FOSS, the new security challenges presented by the smart grid, and the extensive influence of vendors in this space play the largest roles in FOSS adoption in the energy sector.	computer security;device driver;open-source software;semiconductor industry;theme (computing)	Victor Kuechler;Carlos Jensen;Deborah Bryant	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-38928-3_17	engineering management;engineering;environmental resource management;commerce	SE	-77.05140694682004	-4.7838989252126805	64600

1ae425d7b47092c5fa0dff087e894f5c296cadd5	special issue: knowledge, knowing, and organizations: knowing in practice: enacting a collective capability in distributed organizing	empirical study;rate of change;phd;best practice;knowledge management;distributed competence;shared knowledge;organizational knowledge;geographically distributed organizing;informa tion technology;geographic distribution;knowing;organizing practices;product development	In this paper, I outline a perspective on knowing in practice which highlights the essential role of human action in knowing how to get things done in complex organizational work. The perspective suggests that knowing is not a static embedded capability or stable disposition of actors, but rather an ongoing social accomplishment, constituted and reconstituted as actors engage the world in practice. In interpreting the findings of an empirical study conducted in a geographically dispersed hightech organization, I suggest that the competence to do global product development is both collective and distributed, grounded in the everyday practices of organizational members. I conclude by discussing some of the research implications of a perspective on organizational knowing in practice. (Distributed Competence; Geographically Distributed Organizing; Knowing; Organizational Knowledge; Organizing Practices) With the intensification of globalization, acceleration in the rate of change, and expansion in the use of information technology, particular attention is being focused on the opportunities and difficulties associated with sharing knowledge and transferring “best practices” within and across organizations (Leonard-Barton 1995, Brown and Duguid 1998, Davenport and Prusak 1998). Such a focus on knowledge and knowledge management is particularly acute in the context of global product development, where the development and delivery of timely and innovative products across heterogeneous cultures, locales, and markets are critical and ongoing challenges. Dealing effectively with such challenges requires more than just good ideas, strong leaders, and extensive resources; it also requires a deep competence in what may be labeled “distributed organizing”—the capability of operating effectively across the temporal, geographic, political, and cultural boundaries routinely encountered in global operations. What constitutes effective distributed organizing in global product development? In this paper, I wish to explore a possible explanation—an explanation which rests on and elaborates on the premise that effective distributed organizing is an enacted capability constituted in the everyday practices of global product development activities. Such an explanation leads away from the focus on organizational knowledge occupying much of the contemporary discourse on knowledge management, and towards a focus on organizational knowing as emerging from the ongoing and situated actions of organizational members as they engage the world. It is an explanation grounded in what it is people do every day to get their work done. My focus on organizational knowing rather than knowledge is informed by the sociological work of Giddens (1984) and the anthropological studies of Lave (1998), Hutchins (1991, 1995), and Suchman (1987). In these accounts, individuals are understood to act knowledgeably as a routine part of their everyday activity. They are seen to be purposive and reflexive, continually and routinely monitoring the ongoing flow of action—their own and that of others—and the social and physical contexts in which their activities are constituted. As Giddens notes, such activities suggest an “immense knowledgeability involved in the conduct of everyday life” (Giddens and Pierson 1998, p. 90). My intention here is to use the lens of organizational knowing to understand how members of global product development organizations generate and sustain knowledgeability in their distributed operations. The conceptual argument developed here was elaborated through an empirical study I conducted into the product development activities of a large, globally dispersed, high-tech organization which I call Kappa. In what follows, I first lay out the key elements of current perspectives on knowledge before developing my perspective on organizational knowing. I then explore this perspective on knowing in terms of the field study I conducted within Kappa. While organizational knowing appears particularly relevant to the distributed organizing of WANDA J. ORLIKOWSKI Knowing in Practice 250 ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/Vol. 13, No. 3, May–June 2002 global product development, such a capability may also be salient in many other organizational activities. I thus conclude the paper by examining the broader implications for organizational research of a perspective on organizational knowing. Perspectives on Organizational Knowledge The question of knowledge has long occupied philosophers and sociologists of science, but it is only relatively recently that organizational researchers have become interested in this topic. Indeed, “knowledge” has become the watchword of contemporary organizations, and research interest in knowledge, knowledge-based organizations, and knowledge management has accelerated (Kogut and Zander 1992, Starbuck 1992, Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995, Tsoukas 1996, Teece 1998). Two distinct perspectives on organizational knowledge are currently discernable. One proposes that organizations have different types of knowledge, and that identifying and examining these will lead to more effective means for generating, sharing, and managing knowledge in organizations. Tsoukas (1996, p. 13) characterizes such a perspective as “taxonomic,” with researchers developing classifications of knowledge and then using these to examine the various strategies, routines, and techniques through which different types of knowledge are created, codified, converted, transferred, and exchanged (Nelson and Winter 1982, Leonard-Barton 1992, Hedlund 1994, Nonaka 1994, Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995, Winter 1987, Teece 1998, Hansen 1999). Many of these knowledge classifications take as their starting point the distinction made by Polanyi (1967) between tacit and explicit knowing. This classic distinction is then typically used to elaborate additional knowledge dichotomies, for example, local vs. universal, codified vs. uncodified, canonical vs. noncanonical, procedural vs. declarative, and know-how vs. know-what. Some researchers have been critical of a purely taxonomic perspective, arguing that it reifies knowledge by treating it as a stock or set of discrete elements. Furthermore, Tsoukas (1996, p. 14) observes that a taxonomic perspective does not recognize that “tacit and explicit knowledge are mutually constituted . . . [essentially] inseparable.” In particular, he argues that tacit knowledge “is the necessary component of all knowledge; it is not made up of discrete beans which may be ground, lost or reconstituted.” Along with others (Boland and Tenkasi 1995, Davenport and Prusak 1998, Cook and Brown 1999), he argues instead for an integrated approach that affords a view of organizational knowledge as processual, dispersed, and “inherently indeterminate” (1996, p. 22). Brown and Duguid (1998), while they share with Tsoukas (1996) a view of knowledge as emergent, depart from his integrationist focus by retaining a distinction between types of knowledge. In particular, they adapt Ryle’s (1949) articulation of “knowing that” and “knowing how” to argue that “know-how” is different from “know-what” in its dispositional character. Thus, know-how is “the particular ability to put know-what into practice” (Brown and Duguid 1998, p. 91). As such, it is a capability embedded in particular communities of practice (Brown and Duguid 1998, p. 95). This allows know-how to be easily moved within and among communities with similar practices, but makes it “sticky” or difficult to move across communities of practice (Brown and Duguid 1998, pp. 100–102). Recognition of the “stickiness” of know-how has led to various proposals for facilitating knowledge sharing across communities of practice, such as: developing boundary practices (Wenger 1998), engaging knowledge brokers (Brown and Duguid 1998), using boundary objects (Star 1989, Henderson 1991, Carlile 1998), and participating in cross-community communication forums (Boland and Tenkasi 1995). Much has been learned, and much will continue to be learned, from the two perspectives on organizational knowledge discussed above. Significant portions of this work, however, treat knowledge as either a thing (to be captured, stored, transmitted, etc.) or a disposition (whether individual or collective) resulting in “objectivist reification” on the one hand or “subjectivist reduction” on the other. Taylor makes a similar point about rules (1993, pp. 57–58, emphasis added): In its operation, the rule exists in the practice it ‘guides.’ . . . [T]he practice not only fulfills the rules, but also gives it concrete shape in particular situations. . . . In fact, what this reciprocity shows is that the ‘rule’ lies essentially in the practice. The rule is what is animating the practice at any given time, not some formulation behind it, inscribed in our thoughts or our brains or our genes or whatever. That is why the rule is, at any given time, what the practice has made it. Substituting “knowledge” for “rule” in the above quote highlights the difference between a view of knowledge as separate entity, static property, or stable disposition embedded in practice, and a view of knowledge as “at any given time, what the practice has made it.” The latter view sees knowledge as enacted—every day and over time— in people’s practices. It leads us to understand knowledge and practice as reciprocally constitutive, so that it does not make sense to talk about either knowledge or practice without the other. It suggests there may be value in a perspective that does not treat these as separate or separable, a perspective that focuses on the knowledgeability WANDA J.

1f41056b29856c946c934d032f06535aeeb1cd2f	exploring linked statistical data using linked widgets		The Open Data movement has gained momentum among governments, in the business world, and in the public sector in recent years. This movement has resulted in a growing number of open and accessible datasets that have established a solid basis for enhanced service offerings and improved experiences for citizens and businesses. Statistical data, which embodies a big portion of Open Data, comprises a wide range of domains including finance, demographics, transportation, employment, etc. Statistical data plays an important role in public policy formation and as a facilitator for informed decision-making in the private sector. Linked Statistical Data is an evolving concept that combines the richness of Linked Data (a set of best practices for publishing and connecting structured data on the Web) with the descriptiveness of statistical data to integrate data from multiple sources and put it in a semantic context. In this short paper, Linked Statistical Data limitations and challenges are explored before introducing Linked Widgets as an innovative approach.	best practice;experience;linked data;world wide web	A Min Tjoa;Ba-Lam Do;Amin Andjomshoaa;Tuan-Dat Trinh;Peter Wetz;Elmar Kiesling	2014		10.1145/2676585.2676589	computer science;data science;data mining;world wide web	ML	-75.30204996632644	-5.458437501458812	65690

As it is well known, it is not necessarily the best standard which becomes dominant, neither are the consumers who choose it, but the standard from the firm that used the most efficient market strategies. Sometimes a standard takes a long time to become dominant or will not be established because the competition process forces the manufacturers to permanent innovation. Considering the development of digital libraries, the development of diffusion and preservation systems has followed another course, not based on competition, but through the exploration of the symbiosis between Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), Open Archiving Initiative (OAI), and following the Google dominance. From this initiative, the cost of interoperability among digital libraries has greatly diminished. The NSDL (National Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Education Digital Library) defines three levels of cooperation needed to achieve interoperability. The technical level is related to the capacity of each digital library for sharing their metadata and enabling a unified search. The level of correlated content allows distinct repositories to describe their contents uniformly. The organizational level allows the sharing of management and governance of the repositories. This case study describes the open protocols adopted by UFPR in the construction of its digital repository. The digital library's files on logs are used to analyse the increase in the accessibility and visibility of scientific production in this institution.	digital library	Ligia Eliana Setenareski;Marcos Sfair Sunyé;Walter Shima	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39194-1_48	engineering;database;internet privacy;world wide web	EDA	-72.89808804899508	-5.2431813952512085	65789

The networks are technologically complex and entail high costs for subscribers. The political economy of the development process has biased the subscriber base toward the resource rich and away from the resource poor, and toward tried-and-tested uses like Internet and intra-organizational connectivity and away from community-oriented uses. These trends raise troubling questions about network ontology and function, and about the relation between the network and its physical host community. The need for appropriate social policy, and new planning practices, is argued to effect desired change.	community informatics;next-generation network	Murali Venkatesh;Dong Hee Shin	2001	CoRR		social science;economics;telecommunications;artificial intelligence;socioeconomics;management science;sociology;management;computer security;social policy	HCI	-76.74892398171569	-8.516904512251328	65893

If a company has a covert system, it may have had illegible information. Who has it? Why? Most companies want to make good progress of debt finance, inducement of investment and to get a good company image. If the company doesn 't get a good condition on its finance and management, it commits some frauds. The company manipulates financial statements in order to get good assessment results about the state of its finance and management from investors and manages actual data in a covert system. When the company's fraud comes out and the investigation launches, the management may want to secrete his covert system. On the step of data acquisition, the covert system detection influences on the investigation results. If the investigator couldn 't detect the covert system and the fraud company having a covert system may not say about it, the data on the covert system may not come to the front. It is difficult for the investigator to find out the covert system on the physical place or the network.

The use of Internet based commerce by SMEs exposes them to information systems security risks that they are ill equipped to recognise let alone mitigate. Unlike the identification of some business risks, identification of risks associated with information systems requires certain technical expertise. The structure of the existing information system must be understood and modelled before risks can be identified and it is acknowledged that the required technical expertise may not be present in SMEs, thus the involvement of information systems consultants may be necessary. Once the information system has been modelled little information systems expertise is required to complete the analysis, keeping consultant involvement to a minimum and maximising owner/manager involvement.	botnet;e-commerce;hoc (programming language);information systems;information security;information system;outsourcing;risk management;security management;sequence read archive;systems modeling;the australian	Robyn A.

In doing so, an attempt to define and specify this type of firms was conducted. From the authors’ literature review it was found that there is no single definition of high-growth. Each researcher adopts a definition according to his research interests. Trying to discuss the economic importance of SMEs gazelles, analysis led to identify three main features of high-growth: high-growth persistence, the novelty and strategic voluntarism. These characteristics make the high-growth SMEs a specific research object.

While there has been substantial progress in the development and implementation of tools for detecting and preventing cyber attacks, there is a lack of effective methodologies to prosecute the perpetrators of cyber crimes (cyber criminals). Consequently, many cyber crimes go unpunished and many intrusion detections tools go unutilized. Hence there is a need for holistic methodologies that can help organizations collect legally valid evidences from cyber crimes so that appropriate actions can be taken against cyber criminals. This paper presents an approach for this objective by using honeynets.	benchmark (computing);cybercrime;data breach;e-commerce;electronic business;expert system;holism;knowledge base;sensor;the australian	Leonard Kwan;Pradeep Kumar Ray;Greg Stephens	2008	Proceedings of the 41st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2008)	10.1109/HICSS.2008.460	e-commerce;intrusion detection system;public relations;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	EDA	-71.30353350183536	-7.724192347179349	68601

Cyber systems are used extensively to monitor and control critical infrastructures. A number of infrastructures are connected to the Internet via corporate networks. Cyber security is, therefore, an important item of the national security agenda of a country. The intense interest in cyber security has initiated research focusing on national cyber security maturity assessments. However, little, if any, research is dedicated to maturity assessments of national critical infrastructure protection efforts. Instead, the vast majority of studies merely examine diverse national-level security best practices ranging from cyber crime response to privacy protection. This paper proposes a maturity model for measuring the readiness levels of national critical infrastructure protection efforts. The development of the model involves two steps. The first step analyzes data pertaining to national cyber security projects using grounded theory to extract the root causes of the susceptibility of critical infrastructures to cyber threats. The second step determines the maturity criteria by introducing the root causes to subjectmatter experts polled in a Delphi survey. The resulting survey-based maturity model is applied to assess the critical infrastructure protection efforts in Turkey. The results are realistic and intuitively appealing, demonstrating that the maturity model is useful for evaluating the national critical infrastructure protection preparedness of developing countries such as Turkey.

A significant stream of that discussion has regarded American universities as a reference and has resulted, within the diverse range of institutions in the European higher education system, in various organizational and strategic arrangements that go much beyond the traditional roles ascribed to education and research. The unifying characteristic of these different arrangements is provided by the unique characteristics of “the university” as a societal environment for exploration and interpretation of knowledge. We conclude that while the role of the university needs to be re-examined, the institutional integrity of universities must be preserved.	interpretation (logic)	Pedro Conceição;Manuel V.

This research mainly focuses on the HIT efforts in Japan with reference to the US for context. The purpose is to: (a) provide detail on governmental policy impacting promotion of HIT adoption to provide services to the people of Japan, (b) describe the outcomes of past and present policy impacting progress based on a case study of HIT use in the Kyoto Yamashina area, and (c) discuss issues for refinement of current policy.   METHODS The method is case study, and data collection techniques include: (a) interviews of people involved in policy making for HIT in Japan (Japanese healthcare professionals, government officials, and academics involved in HIT research in Japan) and use in the medical community of HIT in the Kyoto Yamashina area, (b) archived document analysis of reports regarding government policy for HIT policy and user assessment for HIT mainly in the case study site, and (c) the literature review about HIT progression and effectiveness assessments to explore and describe issues concerning the transformation with HIT in Japan.   RESULTS This study reveals the aspects of governmental policy that have been effective in promoting successful HIT initiatives as well as some that have been detriments in Japan to help solve pressing social issues regarding healthcare delivery. For example, Japan has stipulated some standardized protocols and formats for HIT but does not mandate exactly how to engage in inter-organizational or intra-organizational health information exchange. This provides some desired autonomy for healthcare organizations and or governments in medical communities and allows for more advanced organizations to leverage current resources while providing a basis for lesser equipped organizations to use in planning the initiative. The insights gained from the Kyoto Yamashina area initiative reflect the success of past governmental policy efforts and the current intent to promote HIT adoption. Insights from the case study as well as other social issues facing Japan warrant some refinement of policy. The refinement concerns: (a) the necessity for leadership and IT knowledge in the medical communities, (b) provider incentives, (c) legislation regarding accountability, security, privacy and confidentiality, (d) inclusion of stakeholders in solution development, and (e) creating sustainable business models.   CONCLUSION The research highlights the efforts of Japan for using HIT in healthcare reform. We present outcomes from a case study of the Kyoto Yamashina area medical community as proof of concept for past and present policy in Japan that are insightful for proliferation of successful projects in Japan and adoption of HIT in general.

Although sophisticated identity management (IdM) technologies have been developed for quite a while, they are not as broadly used as could be expected – in the corporate but especially in an end-user context. Some authors have argued that the reason for this lack of diffusion is not to be found in technological or privacy shortcomings. Rather, it is attributed to the disregard of an economic perspective in the research on IdM and the development of IdM-technologies. This argument, has so far not been scrutinized in a systematic way. Therefore, this article performs a literature analysis of scientific publications to analyze whether there is indeed a lack of publications on IdM that employ an economic perspective. The results of the analysis seem to support the argument that the economic perspective is neglected in the current research on IdM.	identity management;privacy;scientific literature;while	Nicolas Fähnrich;Michael Kubach	2014			theoretical computer science;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-76.23525794925801	-2.1243405482205318	69122

While this may seem complex, in reality a good system should be designed to bring all of these components together in a single system, and make any individual components work as a whole efficiently. Many organisations may not have the resources to implement such a system in its entirety, but the systems can be built up over time. For example, an enterprise could begin the process with no security intelligence capabilities, and then begin targeting specific log and server data to increase visibility, slowly building capabilities over time until they have holistic visibility and proactive threat intelligence throughout the entire IT estate.	data security;holism;information security;mobile device;personally identifiable information;poor posture;private network;security controls;server (computing)	Colin Tankard	2015	Network Security	10.1016/S1353-4858(15)30038-6	public relations;cloud computing security;data mining;business;computer security	Security	-70.68883126034088	-7.188760490419684	69137

I will discuss these systems in a bit more detail and then describe some of the kinds of scenarios for which statistical learning would be most beneficial.	entity;machine learning;network-attached secure disks;sonar	Henry G.

4717754f96ac98907f8f7cb2524aa4f3ba155fb7	looking into the future: scenarios for e-government in 2020	trend analysis	Scenario building is a technique to stimulate different perspectives and images on the future. This technique allows to better predict the evolution of a certain domain beyond short-term forecasting based on the scenarios developed. The EC co-funded project eGovRTD2020 aims to develop scenarios of e-government in 2020 and beyond. The vision is to transform the EC government landscape into a coherent community, which anticipates customer needs and leverages the potential of the diversity and innovativeness of public agencies. In this paper, we give an overview of the scenario building methodology and develop a first set of scenarios using trend analysis. Four scenarios are derived showing different futures on e-government in 2020. The scenarios contain different aspects of integration, decentralization and centralization of power and governmental departments, democratizing systems and the role of individualisms and collectivism in society. The scenarios were used as a starting point for a series of regional scenario building workshops carried out across Europe. In a next stage, the scenarios will feed into a roadmapping exercise for e-government research.

19adc60500fe59e7693977b68a326f50f3434016	reframing the governance debate: a multilevel performance measurement approach based on capabilities	enterprise transformation	Conventional IT planning approaches, which are based on applications, begun to be disputed with the rising interest in service-oriented architectures. But, given the status-quo of the IT landscapes in most companies IT management faces a dilemma. Should IT governance for transformation projects remain at the application-level or should services become the heart of the transformation? In this paper we reframe the ongoing debate on IT governance by introducing a multilevel approach centered on capabilities. In particular, we present an information model, aggregation mechanisms to support performance management based on the model and a planning procedure that guides IT managers and enterprise architects on how to apply our method. Finally, we introduce an example and a prototype to contextualize our method. First findings suggest its usefulness in supporting large enterprise transformation projects.	control theory;european conference on information systems;information model;jack lutz;microsoft outlook for mac;moser spindle;prototype;service-oriented architecture;turbulence	Daniel Fuerstenau	2012			public relations;business transformation;economics;computer science;knowledge management;management	SE	-72.01133923451745	1.6996692096968726	69751

Today's healthcare system is undergoing perceptible changes as the system is facing a paradigm shift due to demographic changes, technological developments, increasing complexity, organisational changes, and demands on user involvement and participation. The aim of this workshop is to reflect on the challenges and dilemmas which are emerging when participatory design is used in Healthcare, because the epistemological, cultural, methodological assumptions of participatory design collide with the traditionally well-established science tradition, language, culture and biomedical approach in health science.  This workshop will be an opportunity to share our experiences in using participatory design in healthcare and research, or experiences in applying participatory design activities across different healthcare systems, particularly addressing dilemmas on knowledge, power and participation.	experience;programming paradigm	Mette Juel Rothmann;Dorthe Boe Danbjørg;Charlotte Myhre Jensen;Jane Clemensen	2016		10.1145/2948076.2948106	knowledge management;environmental resource management;participatory gis;management science;health care	HCI	-76.20385700381952	-3.031306774966471	69843

The process of certification occurs exclusively online. If the enterprise meets all necessary requests an electronic certificate is immediately generated, certifying it as micro, small or a medium-sized enterprise. The certificate may be accessed online by any entity, public or private, that is obliged to request the SME proof. The service reduces administrative burden, reduces contextual costs and promotes harmonization of SME classification.

But data standards do not always improve data quality. We introduce the notion of “quality of data standards” and argue that quality of data is affected by the quality of the standards used. We develop metrics for assessing quality of data standards. The metrics are evaluated empirically using company financial reports created using the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) data standards. Our findings show the use frequency of standard data elements roughly follows a power law distribution. Tradeoffs exist between relevancy and completeness dimensions and between a single user perspective and user community perspective.	data quality;relevance;virtual community	Hongwei Zhu;Liuliu Fu	2009			interoperability;data quality;computer science;pareto distribution;data mining;database;world wide web;long tail	HCI	-76.45602421214234	-0.38988411796171196	70547

A number of attempts have been made by way of software applications; however, these attempts fail. This paper intends to design and implement a system that addresses some of the financial management challenges faced by SMMEs. To achieve this, features of similar systems were studies intensively through related work then incorporated into our system design and then implemented. The main objectives of the new system, was to make it possible for SMME owners to have access to their financial information anywhere, have access to real time data, reduce the amount of time needed to enter data in the system and a system that is easy to use. Usability testing was done and the result was a system that was 20% better in keeping records compared to the user’s manual accounting system.	addresses (publication format);cyberinfrastructure;e-services;geographic information systems;hl7 committee id in rim - financial management;systems design;usability testing	Hisashi Kobayashi	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-66742-3	e-services;economic growth;business;developing country	OS	-69.9922215545926	-8.289086194798971	70915

Like the natural weather, the software environment is also disruptive. As the climate experts alert and suggest taking necessary measures to overcome certain challenges to make this earth a safer and comfortable living place, likewise this article also alerts the relevant stakeholders of software craftsmanship about the dynamic challenges that traditional Software Engineering (SE) with purely “Engineering mind-set” is not capable to respond. Hence, some new thoughts to overcome such challenges are shared. Fundamentally, based on the historical evidences, this article presents the authors’ observation about continuous shift from traditional “Engineering-based” software development approaches to disruptive approaches – “Vibrant Softology”. The authors see the cause of this shift as disruptive transformational force, which is so powerful that it is uncontrollably diminishing the “Engineering-based” approach from software development environments. The authors align it with climate change analogy. Based on this analogy, the authors feel the need to theoretically re-coin the notion of SE to some new term; perhaps Vibrant/Dynamic Softology (VS or DS). Hence, the authors suggest “a new (disruptive and dynamic) way of thinking is required to develop software”. It is worth mentioning that the purpose of article and this new theory is not to disparage the notion of software engineering altogether, rather the aim is to highlight the importance of transformation from SE to its next level (perhaps VS/DS) due to the emerging needs in the software craftsmanship environment.	software engineering	Imran Ghani;Seung Ryul Jeong	2016	TIIS	10.3837/tiis.2016.08.027	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;computer security	SE	-76.28121711450628	-9.837083034582381	71160

The goal of the conference was to examine the scholarly record and its current evolution in a digital world – both in how it functions and how it serves the information and scholarly research communities. The program stressed how in today’s environment, new and innovative advances in information technology are drafting a blueprint that will optimize the ways in which users create, access, and use data and information. New government mandates and policies continue to be implemented on a global basis to facilitate open access to research outputs while in parallel alternative methods for peer review and measuring impact are being utilized. Within the context of these changes, the conference attempted to look at where this blueprint may lead the information community over the next few years.	aggregate data;blueprint;case preservation;cheminformatics;closing (morphology);crowdsourcing;embedded system;information sciences institute;information services & use;information science;knowledge base;library (computing);microsoft lumia;new product development;privacy;scholarly communication;speech analytics	Bonnie Lawlor	2017	Inf.

Such powers are often viewed as a major source of poor governance and should be replaced using information technology. This paper argues that the hollowing out of administrative discretion may not always achieve good governance and suggests an 'open government' approach as a means to prevent arbitrariness in discretionary decisions. The citizen consultation process and the e-government discretionary framework are introduced as a lens with which to analyse and design e-government applications.	e-government	Wanchai Varavithya;Vatcharaporn Esichaikul	2006	EG	10.1504/EG.2006.010799	public relations;actuarial science;e-government;economics;computer science;management;world wide web	Vision	-74.51555751754738	-7.953364870233774	71549

Both local and national governments in many developed countries have found geographic information systems (GIS) to be a critical tool in resource management, regional planning, and economic development. Unfortunately, the practical use of GIS in many developing countries is hampered by the lack of accurate and detailed spatial and demographic data, political considerations, and management issues. To highlight importance of these issues, we present a framework for GIS adoption in less developed countries and discuss these and other constraints in the context of this framework. We also offer ideas for technical, managerial, and policy initiatives that should be helpful in addressing impediments to GIS adoption. These ideas are summarized in a set of propositions and a related framework that shows our expectations about the impact of these initiatives on implementation success.

27bd39cb3c9ad7baa1df5a8de7bfe0261fe3ef63	us open data policy: advances and recommendations		The Federal Government in the United States has a long tradition in promoting citizen access to information. In the last years, and promoted by strong support from the Executive, Federal Government Agencies have engaged in understanding, cataloguing and publishing their data assets. Beyond the exercise of cataloguing data assets, Federal Agencies have also worked on specific projects in their own domain, and sometimes across domains or national borders. The main purpose of this paper is to assess current progress of the Open Government Data (OGD) policy in the US Federal Government, identify enablers and current challenges, also providing some recommendations to move forward with the vision of OGD.	freedom of information laws by country	Luis F.

Towards the design of such solutions, the identification of the main energy consuming factors, trends, and patterns, along with the appropriate modeling and understanding of the occupants' behavior and the potential for the adoption of environmentally-friendly lifestyle changes have to be realized. In the current article, an innovative energy-aware information technology (IT) ecosystem is presented, aiming to support the design and development of novel personalized energy management and awareness services that can lead to occupants' behavioral change towards actions that can have a positive impact on energy efficiency. Novel information and communication technologies (ICT) are exploited towards this direction, related mainly to the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), data modeling, management and fusion, big data analytics, and personalized recommendation mechanisms. The combination of such technologies has resulted in an open and extensible architectural approach able to exploit in a homogeneous, efficient and scalable way the vast amount of energy, environmental, and behavioral data collected in energy efficiency campaigns and lead to the design of energy management and awareness services targeted to the occupants' lifestyles. The overall layered architectural approach is detailed, including design and instantiation aspects based on the selection of set of available technologies and tools. Initial results from the usage of the proposed energy aware IT ecosystem in a pilot site at the University of Murcia are presented along with a set of identified open issues for future research.	apache spark;behavioral analytics;big data;centralized computing;cognitive walkthrough;complex event processing;conceptualization (information science);data mining;data modeling;data quality;drools;ecosystem;ecosystem services;entropy (computing);feedback;genetic heterogeneity;information sciences;information and communication theory;interconnection;internet of things;interoperability;largest;linked data;mobile app;performance evaluation;personalization;python;r language;reasoning - publishing subsection;recommender system;rule (guideline);scalability;semantic data model;solutions;specification;stemming;transmitter;universal instantiation;anatomical layer;registration - actclass;sensor (device)	Eleni Fotopoulou;Anastasios Zafeiropoulos;Fernando Terroso-Saenz;Umutcan Simsek;Aurora González-Vidal;George Tsiolis;Panagiotis Gouvas;Paris Liapis;Anna Fensel;Antonio F.

12ce96cd9ef8246649048d0acc5337c84bdced7f	exploring the utility of grids for analysing long term population change		Article history: Received 21 March 2017 Received in revised form 11 July 2017 Accepted 20 July 2017 Available online 30 July 2017 This paper details an innovative approachwhich enables the analysis of small area population change across four decades. Population surfaces are generated using small area data (enumeration districts or output areas) for each Census from1971 to 2011 inclusive. The paper details themethods used in the creation of these surfaces, and discusses the rationale behind this approach, arguing that grids represent themost appropriatemodel for assessing population distributions. Methods for grid creation are tested using pre-existing population grids for Northern Ireland as a benchmark. The method developed is then applied to create population grids for the rest of the UK for 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011. The changing population structures of small areas across these five time points are explored here to illustrate the value of this approach. The publically-available data resource – the final product of the ‘PopChange’ project – will facilitate exploration of long-term changes in populations over small areas. The paper argues that maximum advantage could be taken of the ‘big data revolution’ if such data were gridded in a similar way, allowing them to be placed in a longer-term historical context, using tools made available through the PopChange project.

In this paper, the intention is to augment the existing literature on regional convergence across the NUTS-2 regions of EU-27 in terms of agricultural labour productivity during the period 1995-2004. A low annual rate of absolute convergence is estimated for the NUTS-2 regions over the period 1995-2004. The rate of regional convergence exhibits a considerable variation across different territorial divisions of the European Union. The implications of these results are discussed in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy and respective recommendations are issued.	common criteria;regional lockout	Stilianos Alexiadis;Nikolaos Hasanagas;Christos Ladias	2011			common agricultural policy;regional science;agricultural economics;agriculture;annual percentage rate;economics;european union	Metrics	-76.81666620664362	-7.27240243511668	74055

As practise has shown until now information system (IS) technologies find a most suitable application in e-government, which enables the further evolution of the services that are offered, the need that are satisfied and the areas that are covered by it. The information initiatives is used for the implementation of e-government initiatives need to be in pace with the growing call of citizens for quality, cost effective services, and responsiveness in such a dynamic and continuously changing environment. Finding solutions to the security implications is still a mirage, though so much have been put in placed to solve these inherent problems without yielding much result. This paper recommends a unified e-government paradigm model.	e-government;information system;internet;online and offline;programming paradigm;responsiveness	Cyril Ehijie Azenabor;Charles A.

9ea0d2adfcbfbeaf5344b2807a5701f67da2957b	fuzzy ahp analysis of firm-level knowledge accumulation		Knowledge is considered to be a useful tool for a firmu0027s competitiveness and sustainability. There is considerable evidence confirming that firm-level knowledge (FLK) accumulation provides a competitive advantage for firms, through innovation. Therefore, most knowledge-intensive firms accumulate FLK via exploitative practices to prevent deterioration of their innovation performance. This study adopts methods including expert interviews, an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy set theory to analyse the FLK accumulation in firms. This study proposes that three influential factors for FLK accumulation are knowledge integration (KI), knowledge absorption (KA) and knowledge sharing (KS). This study reveals that KI is the most influential factor of a firmu0027s FLK accumulation, and the sub-factor of “Integration Ability” plays the most critical role of KI in FLK accumulation.	analytical hierarchy;binary prefix;competitive analysis (online algorithm);fuzzy set;knowledge integration;nl (complexity);naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;numerical aperture;set theory;strategic management;tree accumulation;windows legacy audio components;zero-knowledge proof	Pham Thi Minh Ly;Wen-Hsiang Lai	2017	JIKM	10.1142/S0219649217500241	analytic hierarchy process;computer science;competitive advantage;fuzzy logic;knowledge management;fuzzy set;knowledge integration;knowledge sharing	AI	-69.68069678028357	1.1173781874741804	74597

Two knowledge management systems that were utilized during Hurricane Katrina response are described and analyzed. The systems specified were developed by both federal agencies as well as grass root efforts without the support or mandate of government programs. These programs, although developed independently, were able to share data and interact in life-saving capacities, transcending traditional geo-political boundaries. We conclude that emergency information systems are enhanced by incorporating knowledge management tools and concepts.	information system;knowledge management	Tim Murphy;Murray E.

8702bd42ed3234bbb705ed5f1d0672dc26a0a8fc	big data, open government and e-government: issues, policies and recommendations		The transformative promises and potential of Big and Open Data are substantial for e-government services, openness and transparency, governments, and the interaction between governments, citizens, and the business sector. From “smart” government to transformational government, Big and Open Data can foster collaboration; create real-time solutions to challenges in agriculture, health, transportation, and more; promote greater openness; and usher in a new era of policyand decision-making. There are, however, a range of policy challenges to address regarding Big and Open Data, including access and dissemination; digital asset management, archiving and preservation; privacy; and security. After presenting a discussion of the open data policies that serve as a foundation for Big Data initiatives, this paper examines the ways in which the current information policy framework fails to address a number of these policy challenges. It then offers recommendations intended to serve as a beginning point for a revised policy framework to address significant issues raised by the U.S. government’s engagement in Big Data efforts.	archive;big data;case preservation;digital asset;e-government;openness;real-time transcription	John Carlo Bertot;Ursula Gorham;Paul T.

While the stimulus has promoted the development of China's domestic market, it has resulted in serious problem of inflation. In her efforts to control the inflation, China's government has encouraged retailers to engage directly with goods producers to reduce the cost in the middle including distribution, transportation and other retailing cost. In this paper, we analyze the role of warehouse in this transition. We argue that warehouse could provide additional opportunities to tackle the inflation by linking the suppliers and consumers. The warehousing scheme is then introduced with risk analysis.

The methodology comprises three phases. Each phase is interlinked and designed to build support and trust as the collaboration develops. Managing risk is central to open innovation strategy, but there aren ́t relevant scientific or empirical studies explaining the relationship between them. Steady progress has been made over the last years by many authors in establishing an understanding of open innovation strategy. There are several forms of open innovation. One of them is crowdsourcing innovation, the focus of this paper. In crowdsourcing strategy, a company posts a problem by an open call and a vast number of individuals offer solutions to the problem. The winning ideas are awarded some form of a bounty and the company mass produces the idea for its own gain. This strategy can be applied in two ways: (1) by internally identifying business problems and needs for innovation felt by individuals, teams and organizational units (seekers) that are then made available to a community of internal and external specialists motivated to provide their knowledge and skills to address those problems. In doing so brings, employees of the company can improve their internal visibility and be empowered in decision processes across the company; (2) by placing the company’s innovation challenges to a brokering service that can find the right people to present the solutions (solvers). This work provides overall guidelines to managing risks associated with crowdsourcing strategy and to apply open innovation and theoretical frameworks to understand how firms can benefit from accessing external knowledge in order to support their R&D processes.	crowdsourcing;linkage (software);open innovation;risk management;solver	Liêda Souza;Isabel Ramos;José Esteves	2009			knowledge management;marketing;business;risk analysis	Web+IR	-76.76815026039765	2.3610651536742844	76692

Personal computer, multimedia techniques and the web provided useful technology for the purposes of collaborative processes. Following the advent of Web 2.0, the wide diffusion of electronic devices containing geo-referenced information have resulted in the production of extensive spatial data. The present study will assess how, the collaborative approach to planning can be supported by the Web, also using “Volunteered Geographic Information” (VGI) tools, analyzing the possible benefits and drawbacks using the results of experiences made by the author and available in literature. The chapter starts from an introduction to the collaborative approach and illustrates, in the second paragraph, a first panoramic on criticisms and opportunities in using ICT for collaborative planning. In the third paragraph the paper discuss possible opportunities and risks for participation in urban planning using VGI tools. Conclusions are made in the last paragraph.	cognitive model;contingency (philosophy);experience;geographic information system;informatics;multi-agent system;personal computer;volunteered geographic information;web 2.0;world wide web	Francesco Rotondo;Francesco Selicato	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21887-3_16	knowledge management;data mining;volunteered geographic information;database;management science	HCI	-66.79017375491037	-6.21399441968334	77058

a82ceb9ba23ae007921f3d80896efd43f82e83f7	supporting ethical web research: a new research ethics review	ethics review;ethics;research methods;institutional review board irb	Research ethics is an important and timely topic. In academia, federally regulated Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) protect participants of human subjects research, and offer researchers a mechanism to assess the ethical implications of their work. Industry research labs are not subject to the same requirements, and may lack processes for research ethics review. We describe the creation of a new ethics framework and a research ethics submission system (RESS) within Microsoft Research (MSR). This RESS is customized to the needs of web researchers. We describe our iterative development process, including our assessment of the current state of web research, developing a framework of methods based on a survey of 358 research papers; build and evaluate our system with 14 users to identify the benefits and pitfalls of full deployment; evaluate how our system matches with existing federal regulations; and, suggest next steps for supporting ethical web research.	iterative and incremental development;iterative method;microsoft research;requirement;software deployment	Anne Bowser;Janice Y.

As an effort to promote international collaborations on spatial studies of Chinese religions and society, a spatial information network for the studies of Christianity in China has been established by a group of scholars from several institutions in the U.S. and China. The objectives of the project include: (1) to establish a centralized information infrastructure; (2) to provide effective tools and technical support for interested users through spatial intelligence information technology; (3) to create an online research forum designed to promote information sharing and improve understanding of Christianity in China; and (4) to render comprehensive information about teaching, learning, and training on the studies of Chinese Christianity. This paper will present some results from the project, including an online spatial information platform, which will integrate data, methodology and research references for the studies of Chinese Christianity. This paper will discuss the information structure, methodology, and technology applied in this system. The system allows easy access to comprehensive demographic, economic, and religious information in China as well as some online tools for spatial data analysis. It will demonstrate how space-time data of different formats and sources can be integrated, visualized, and reported in a web based system for religious studies. Some case studies for Chinese religions and future directions will be discussed.	accessibility;centralized computing;information theory;spatial analysis;technical support	Shuming Bao;Changzhen Wang;Miao Shui	2014	2014 22nd International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2014.6950848	spatial data infrastructure;social science;knowledge management;political science	HCI	-64.28676964849083	-6.385023318615107	77888

Those lists have to be obeyed in order to avoid legal implications. Yet, sanction lists are of very low information quality. Nevertheless, regulatory compliance demands, that organizations check their customer master data against sanction lists. We analyze sanction lists in this contribution with respect to their information quality and derive from this analysis requirements on a compliant system. We present a case study of a software vendor that equipped its information system with an extension that enables organizations to comply with sanction lists. We provide details on its implementation and evaluation.	customer relationship management;entity;information quality;information system;microsoft account;problem domain;requirement;smoothed-particle hydrodynamics	Jochen Kokemüller	2010			public relations;political science;data mining;computer security	Security	-70.89651731214596	-6.270854825156867	77991

As a result, a ten year egovernment implementation horizon has been created from tested world wide practices. Thus far the plan is not being realised and a gap is appearing between what the policy says should be happening and what is actually happening. This gap is most likely a result of a lack of government capacity to meet the policy objectives. In this paper the author puts forward a framework – drawing on actor network theory (ANT) and the due process model – which aims to improve the current e-government implementation process and close the gap between policy and practices in South Africa.	e-government;network theory;process modeling	J P Martin Trusler	2003		10.1007/10929179_95	public policy;social environment;process modeling	AI	-76.1794561712846	-6.821376303073048	78124

While such studies represent forms of mixed-methods research, they are rarely acknowledged as such. This means that researchers are potentially failing to recognise the challenges and opportunities offered by multi-phase research, particularly in terms of data integration. This paper provides a brief case study of how one framework – Bazely & Kemp’s metaphors for integrated analysis – was employed to formalise data integration for a large exploratory evaluation study.	failure;information access	Simon Wakeling;Paul D.

Whereas ICT impact on loan origination has been studied already in earlier papers there are no in-depth studies available mainly focused at credit risk management, which reaches beyond mere origination. After presenting a general analysis about ICT impact on value creation in the financial industry, this paper provides a state-of-the-art analysis of e-business tools for credit risk management emphasizing their value proposition with respect to credit risk management. The analysis is based on the hypothesis that only by innovative e-business solutions traditional loan business can convert into active credit risk management. As a result the research comes up with three categories of tools which are valuation platforms, rating tools, and trading platforms. It can be shown that ICT leads to the deconstruction of the traditional loan business model.	electronic business;risk management;value (ethics)	Simone Westerfeld;Hans-Dieter Zimmermann	2008	Proceedings of the 41st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2008)	10.1109/HICSS.2008.132	credit crunch;credit reference;liquidity risk;collateral management;risk management;credit risk;marketing;credit history;finance;enterprise risk management;credit analysis;management;credit valuation adjustment;commerce;financial risk management;credit enhancement	DB	-76.751787746229	3.744624616621305	79269

Therefore, managers are facing new challenges. One such daunting task is the ability to manage knowledge, as this can now be exchanged or transferred on the Internet or Intranet without physical contact or time constraints. To understand some of the key human resource issues related to organizing global knowledge in the e-commerce context, an exploratory case study was conducted. One of the key findings from this case study is the recognition that human resource management (HRM) will play a new dual role in organizing global knowledge sharing in the e-commerce era. One role is to continue dealing with traditional administrative transactions and the other is to nurture knowledge-related activities. This contradicts simplistic prescriptions about managing knowledge, which suggests that the implementation and utilization of a...	intranet	Shan Ling Pan;Ming-Huei Hsieh;Helen Chen	2001	J. Org.

This paper investigates three potential theories to analyze that choice. In addition, the bifurcation suggests development of approaches to facilitate the integration of content and collaboration. Further, this paper investigates the role of personal knowledge management in collaboration and content generation.

They are seen as one of the reasons for the economic success of certain regions in comparison to others. This paper studies the evolution of such industrial clusters. To this end, a spatial structure of regions is set up and the entry, exit, and growth of firms within these regions is modelled and studied with the help of simulations. Several mechanisms that are often stated to be important in the context of localised industrial clusters are explicitly modelled. The influence of these mechanisms on the geographical concentration of industries is studied.		Thomas Brenner	2001	J.

Computer tasks such as data management, network operations, or disaster recovery can ail be expertly handled by outside sources. Many companies have successfully applied outsourcing techniques to provide added services or products to their customers. Historically, many firms have made sourcing decision, commonly known as make-or-buy decisions based disproportionately on unit cost . with insufficient regard for strategic or technological issues. This cost-focused approach has led to competitive tragedy for many firms. Managers need better tools for evaluating sourcing decisions. These tools should accommodate the long-term, strategic issues. This paper presents such a tool, the Strategic Sourcing mode, which augments the traditional cost analysis by considering strategic and technological factors. Using this framework, in conjunction with a cost analysis, can assist firms make the sourcing decisions that will position them for sustained competitive success in the future.	disaster recovery;information processing;outsourcing	Louis A.

However, recent studies show that there is a short supply of professionals who are able to deal with data appropriately. This is at least partly caused by a mismatch between university offerings and presumed industry needs. This study analyses two related questions. First, what competences are actually required for being a data professional? Second, what competences are imparted through data-related master`s programmes? These questions are answered by applying a topic model approach (first question) and deductive content analysis (second question). By using the same set of competence dimensions, the answers to these questions are used to discuss the overall issue of how curricula are aligned with workforce demands for data-related competences. The focus is placed on the UK market that suffers from a shortage of data professionals particularly in the financial industry. We find that companies require ‘all-rounders’ who possess strong technical, analytical, and business competences, while master`s programmes rarely impart business competences. Main contributions include an empirically derived typology of data professionals, the application of a topic model for IS research, and an analysis framework that allows universities to critically assess their offerings.	big data;biological anthropology;norm (social);topic model	Matthias Murawski;Markus Bick	2017			knowledge management;topic model;data science;big data;computer science;competence (human resources)	Web+IR	-77.1144832462529	0.3661291714410601	80261

Additionally, this study discusses appropriate threat mitigation strategies for the four sectors as well.Design/methodology/approach – Using an empirical study, this study explores the past and current concerns of IS threats of firms in different industries, and the countermeasures prepared by them to protect themselves from such threats.

This paper examines whether and when state technical capabilities attract foreign investment in manufacturing from 1987-1993. We find that on average state R&D intensity does not attract foreign direct investment. Most investing firms are in lower-tech industries and locate in low R&D intensity states, suggesting little interest in state technical capabilities. In contrast, we find that firms in research-intensive industries are more likely to locate in states with high R&D intensity. Foreign firms in the pharmaceutical industry value state R&D intensity the most, at a level twice that of firms in the semiconductor industry, and four times that of electronics firms. Interestingly, not only firms from technically lagging nations, but also some firms from technically leading nations are attracted to R&D intensive states. This suggests that beyond catching up, firms use knowledge-seeking investments also to source technical diversity.

c41739c1e2142cc3b46d1587c804a74bb1d2e7dd	managing agile		Agile, originally derived in part from the manufacturing sector, has evolved into a set of principles and practices that have flourished within and found applications beyond the IT sector. Its adaptive, value-driven, collaborative and empowering essence drives innovation in an iterative and incremental manner that is founded upon organisational and experiential learning. Over time, many methodologies (e.g., XP, Scrum, DSDM, SAFe®) have become established reflecting different facets of Agile ranging from engineering, product development, project management and enterprise architectural perspectives all of which continue to be influenced by other developments (e.g., lean). Assessed in the sober light of day, however, Agile not only poses but also faces challenges within organisations that must question the role of existing structures and hierarchies, people factors together with their culture and processes that ultimately address the core nature and existence of the enterprise.	agile software development;dynamic systems development method;iteration;iterative and incremental development;new product development;safe-biopharma association;scrum (software development)	Alan Moran	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-16262-1		SE	-76.34993641888121	1.0011515024593047	81615

This paper begins by presenting an overview of the problem, considering the scope and scale of reported incidents. From this, a series of common attack types are considered (focusing upon website defacement, denial of service and malware), with specific emphasis upon the potential for these to be automated and mounted by novices. Leading on from this, the problem of policing cybercrime is considered, with attention to the need for suitable legislation, and appropriate resourcing of law enforcers. It is concluded that that cybercrime is an inevitable downside of the information society, and that organizations and individuals consequently have a stake in ensuring their own protection.	cybercrime;denial-of-service attack;malware;notability in the english wikipedia;website defacement	Steven Furnell	2003		10.1007/3-540-45068-8_2	computer science;artificial intelligence;computer security;denial-of-service attack	Security	-71.12975006477906	-9.521328554855847	82214

However, rapidly growing investments in IT, since the 1970s, coincided with poor productivity gains. This problem of the 'productivity paradox' has attracted much academic attention. Using statistical data from 21 developed countries, this paper analyses the trends of productivity paradox from 1995 to 2005 employing three-level methodological approach to assess the productivity. The first level analysis examines macroeconomic indicators (GDP per capita and IT investment growth), the second level considers the internal structure of IT investments, and the third level analyses labour and multi-factor productivity. The findings of the study suggest there is a high positive correlation of IT investments with GDP growth. At the same time labour and multi-factor productivity do not significantly correlate with technology investments. 1 INTRODUCTION Information and communication technology (ICT) is considered by some as the key factor driving economic growth in present-day industrial societies (Pohjola 2003). Investing in information technology (IT), is therefore regarded as having potential for reducing costs, enhancing productivity, and improving living standards (Murakami 1997). However, there is a body of evidence that IT has not consistently produced positive business results. Since the 1970s productivity growth in almost all of the world economies has slowed, while expenditures on ICT have risen (Rei, 2004). This phenomenon became a key management concern not only for businesses but also for economies as a whole and further became known as the 'productivity paradox'. During the last two decades, the topic of productivity paradox has been revisited periodically by many Extensive multi-dimensional (firm-level, industry-level, country-level and cross country) analysis found little evidence that IT significantly increased productivity in the 1970s and 1980s. This could have emerged due mainly to inaccurate productivity measurement, time lags related to technology diffusion, mismanagement issues, and insufficient use of technologies. However, some recent studies of Brynjolfsson and Hitt (1996), Dedrick and Kraemer (2001) and Pilat (2004) present strong evidence that ICT has consistently produced positive results implying that there was no paradox in productivity. Over the past thirty years the practice of ICT implementation has helped to build a relatively sound empirical base for study. Modern statistical methods have enabled more accurate data. New data processing and collection approaches are able to quantify previously immeasurable impacts of ICT, revealing new opportunities for research.	artificial intelligence;breath of fire iii;key management;separable polynomial	Valisher Ibragimov;Julian Sims	2008			economics;public economics;total factor productivity;agricultural productivity;economy;developed country;management;economic growth	HCI	-76.16602478922054	-8.257859666762247	82284

d21d481632d5cfae252262f344acd053c4c9ad24	towards a process for total information risk management		The importance of information as a resource and competitive factor in today’s society and economy is constantly rising. As a consequence, it becomes necessary for organizations to manage the risks that arise from poor information quality (IQ) in the same way other operational and strategic risks are managed. Information is, however, an unique and intangible resource that requires special methods and techniques for managing its related risks. This paper proposes a process for Total Information Risk Management (TIRM) that enables the assessment and treatment of organization-wide information risks in a systematic and effective manner. The TIRM process provides a practical approach that unites the best practices of the IQ and the risk management disciplines. We have tested and refined the TIRM process by extensive application in four in-depth case studies in different industries following a rigorous process development approach.	best practice;expectation propagation;futures studies;it risk management;imperative programming;information quality;java;programming tool;spreadsheet;usability	Alexander Borek;Ajith Kumar Parlikad;Philip Woodall	2011			risk analysis (engineering);risk management information systems;business;factor analysis of information risk;risk analysis (business);it risk management	SE	-72.68396962736112	1.9145370360834661	82594

Nowadays, the construction industry is already a pillar industry in China’s economic development. It keeps China’s economy growing rapidly in recent years. Therefore, China is gradually increasing its investment in construction projects. However, the construction project has the characteristics of large scale, long construction period, high cost, many stakeholders, and complex technology. Besides, it has obvious social characteristics. Therefore, construction projects lack of sociological perspective to analyze the problem of the project organization. Based on the characteristics of the construction project, this paper studies the organizational structure of the project, and analyzes the main application of the social network analysis method in the project.

These legal entities are frequently organized into complex ownership schemes set up in different countries, and with a “Chinese boxes” structure, in order to make it harder to determine who ultimately controls them and benefits of the illegal conduct. Currently there are a lot of competitors in the market of Financial Fraud Detection but the software that they propose are mainly oriented to supervise and manage the institutions’ internal compliance processes such as the management and transmission of Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) instead of providing intelligence tools for proactively discovery potential threats and identify the final beneficiaries of illegal operations. Consequently there is a potential for Financial Fraud Detection focused on the on-line, real-time statistical analysis of transactions, operators behaviour, price movements and the use of data mining algorithms that work on heterogeneous sources of big data. After having described the schemes used for executing the three most relevant financial frauds this research proposes a novel approach for the detection of illicit behaviours and suspect transactions. The approach benefits of a multidisciplinary approach for the analysis of the big data streams coming heterogeneous sources such as TV stream, social media and public (official and unofficial) data bases.

It recently received the investment grade from prominent risk-assessment agencies, which means the country is more likely to meet payment obligations, attracting more investments. In addition, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa formed a group known as Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) to discuss and implement ways to improve the global economic scenario. Brazil is also a full member of the Mercosur and actively participated in numerous United Nations missions.	automation;internet architecture board;robotics	Edson Prestes e Silva;Vitor A. M.

bb97449558f89a600202cd8f854f9249a8eaf017	physical and digital innovation in shipping: seeding, standardizing, and sequencing		Two innovations within shipping are analyzed. (1) Containerization, an analog innovation that commenced about 50 years ago, created a new system for the handling of global trade and drove shipping costs to the point of financial irrelevance. (2) Sea traffic management is an EU digital innovation in process that aims to revolutionize the shipping business. We identify the seed innovation, which in each case initiates a standardization process and a series of sequenced and coordinated innovations that created a new transport system in one case, and are planned to fashion a smarter system in the second. We conclude with some research questions on seed innovations and the sequencing of innovations for new system emergence. 1. A critical global problem The global shipping industry is responsible for around 90% of the world’s trade [1] because it is the most cost-effective form of transport. A container ship can move the equivalent of several large warehouses of goods with a crew of about 13. For instance, the cost of transporting a kilogram of coffee from Asia to Europe is only fifteen cents, or one percent of item cost. Because ships need to carry sufficient fuel for a voyage, they are powered by energy dense fossil fuels. With a yearly growth rate of about 4% [2], water borne transport will be a continuing source of carbon emissions for some years. Significantly, in 2007 ocean cargo shipping produced about 840 million metric tons of CO2 [3], approximately 2.7% of the estimated global carbon emissions. Without major changes in technology and policies, shipping could by 2050 1 http://www.worldshipping.org/benefits-of-linershipping/efficiency 2 http://co2now.org/Current-CO2/CO2-Now/global-carbonemissions.html account for 17% of global CO2 emissions [4]. The industry is a sustainability slowcoach [5]. This article compares and contrasts two shipping innovations for improving efficiency and sustainability. Containerization, an analog innovation, was initiated 50 years ago, and sea traffic management, based on a digital innovation, is in the early stages of implementation. 2. EU funded innovation In 2010, the European Union (EU) commenced a multi-year project to fund innovation in the shipping industry to improve efficiency, safety, and sustainability, goals which parallel the triple bottom line of profits, people, and planet [6]. The initial project, MONALISA 1.0, concentrated on increasing ship-to-ship collaboration through sharing routes among ships and shore-based vessel management authorities. The project operated in the Baltic Sea Region. This project was then extended, MONALISA 2.0 (2013-2015), to cover more regions in Europe with more partners and an increased budget. The focus, inspired by the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR) project, was to enhance Sea Traffic Management (STM) by applying three concepts (voyage management, flow management, and port collaborative decision-making) supported by a digital data-sharing infrastructure. In 2015, the project was renamed STM validation and the consortia was granted €43 million to validate STM concepts in 13 ports with over 300 participating ships. The EU sees acceleration of the industry’s digitization as critical to meeting its goals, and it expects STM to revolutionize the shipping business. The STM project’s success will require the coordination and integration of multiple layers of innovation, from data messaging to governance. 3 http://stmvalidation.eu 4756 Proceedings of the 50th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences | 2017 URI: http://hdl.handle.net/10125/41741 ISBN: 978-0-9981331-0-2	digital data;emergence;fossil;instant messaging;international standard book number;region-based memory management;relevance;seed;software transactional memory;ti-92 series;uniform resource identifier	Richard T.

A&M raise valid concerns with journal norms in respect to acceptance of novelty, tolerance for triviality, possibly unethical behaviour, and, implicitly, accepted epistemological practices for theorizing and theory development. Although I share many of their concerns about journal practice, I have serious concerns that readers will view their paper as attacking theory-in-itself despite the authors’ protestations they are not doing so. The guidelines they advance could promote the idea that theory-free articles are acceptable, which I see as a dangerous path for our field. I believe we should be focusing more on the theorizing process and underlying epistemological issues. In this way, we can view and justify new and surprising ideas and interesting empirical findings in single articles against a backdrop of ongoing theory development in the field as a whole.

Competing technologies in emerging industries create uncertainties that discourage supplier investments. Open technology can induce supplier investments, but may also lead to intensified future competition. In this paper, we study competing manufacturers’ open-technology strategies. We show that despite the risk of intensifying future competition, open technologies by competing manufacturers may constitute an equilibrium and can indeed induce supplier investments. In addition, we identify a technology-riskpooling benefit; namely, by opening technologies, competing manufacturers can induce supplier investments in both technologies and later adopt the one preferred by the market. However, manufacturers may also exhibit the prisoner’s dilemma and close their technologies despite the risk-pooling benefit. In this case, there is potential for collaborative technology sharing through cross licensing. Finally, we show that manufacturers may sometimes close their technologies to force supplier investments.	converge;dominator (graph theory);ecosystem;expect;fo (complexity);field electron emission;hydrogen;institute for operations research and the management sciences;interaction;modulation;nl (complexity);prisoner's dilemma;procurement;real life;scott continuity;software license;tesla (microarchitecture);tesla coil	Bin Hu;Ming Hu;Yi Yang	2017	Manufacturing & Service Operations Management	10.1287/msom.2016.0598	economics;procurement;marketing;operations management;supplier relationship management;competitive advantage;commerce	HCI	-71.53538375452723	-0.7777635524394918	85373

0d7c4b5a22d00503a074792e9eb09faeed6fc1c3	the limits of hcd: reimagining the anthropocentricity of iso 9241-210		Human-centred design (HCD) is just that: human-centred. As we approach the limits of Earth's biophysical systems, it no longer feels appropriate to place humans at the centre of design decisions. Yet HCD and its ISO---ISO-9241-210:2010---continue to be powerful and popular tools within many computing and design departments, as well as in their affiliated industries. These design approaches are perpetuating the trend of incremental improvements to the living standards of the already privileged and digitally connected whilst ignoring the broader environmental and socio-political effects of digital technologies. In this paper, we attempt to reimagine HCD and its ISO by drawing on fields and concepts such as sustainable interaction design (SID), animal-computer interaction (ACI), and object oriented ontology (OOO). Through this, we contribute a preliminary set of proposals about what needs to change with HCD and its ISO. We close by discussing the ISO development process and suggesting routes for environmentally concerned researchers to influence the evolution of HCD's ISO.	expectation propagation;humans;interaction design;while	Vanessa Thomas;Christian Remy;Oliver Bates	2017		10.1145/3080556.3080561	simulation;systems engineering;interaction design;object-oriented ontology;iso 9241;engineering	HCI	-77.31023878847571	-9.773966132279059	85937

We introduce the idea of the e-commercialization of science, and how it supplements the existing scientific infrastructure, its system of incentives, the assessment of the work of scientists, and their remuneration as the authors of ideas and innovations. We also argue that the modernization of the model of interaction among scientists from a market of collaboration to a market of scientific products, technologies, and ideas makes it possible to take advantage of scientific advancement provided by the openness of scientific communication.	digital media;e-commerce;emergence;global network;interaction;scientific communication;scientific literature;semiconductor;value (ethics)	Andrei Dynich;Yanzhang Wang	2016	Electronic Commerce Research and Applications	10.1016/j.elerap.2016.11.001	science communication;knowledge management;management science;science, technology, society and environment education	DB	-71.79861251575053	-4.16956363103466	86035

Design/methodology/approach – The study uses a case study methodology and employs the qualitative methods of interviews and document analysis to collect data on Hyundai Motors Co. (HMC) and its key first-tier supplier, referred to here as Supplier A, in the Korean automobile industry. Findings – The results of the study show that a key strategic action to implement carbon management is to identify and measure the carbon footprint of products and processes within the supply chain. A carbon footprint measurement framework and different levels of CO2 adoption categories developed at HMC are presented. By monitoring and evaluating suppliers’ CO2 emissions performance, a focal company may avoid carbon-related risk and retain competitiveness based on its supply chain. Practical implications – Developing a carbon footprint measurement and evaluation program in the supply chain provides a track record to improve carbon and energy efficiency. This may lead companies to develop and exploit greater energy efficiency to tackle carbon emission challenges in the supply chain. Originality/value – This paper provides academics and managers with a new approach to consider carbon management and green supply chain management.	focal (programming language);hybrid memory cube;multitier architecture	Ki-Hoon Lee;In-Mo Cheong	2011	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/02635571111144991	greenhouse gas;supply chain management;environmental engineering;economics;design methods;engineering;qualitative research;environmental resource management;marketing;operations management;supply chain;efficient energy use;management;sustainability	Metrics	-72.30751114868625	1.0388230433342653	86243

The paper will concentrate on the formative period of the """"science-based regulatory state"""" since the 1870s. Relying on case studies, regulatory politics based on science will be characterized as a bargaining process (in contrast to a technocratic model of applying science to political problems). Empirically, examples are treated for technical safety (stearn-boiler control, materials testing) and for environmental hazards (sanitary and industrial pollution of rivers). I. THE FORMATION OF THE SCIENCE-BASED REGULATORY STATE The abundant literature on regulation conventionally distinguishes """"economic"""" regulation from """"social"""" (or product) regulation. Consider the difference between regulating the """"price"""" or the """"quality"""" of a product. This 'distinction is often equated with a historical development from """"old"""" to """"new"""" regulation. Consequently, if deregulation is takmg place, it is mainly confined to """"economic"""" aspects, whereas issues of consumer protection and safety are kept in charge of government. It can be shown, however, that """"social"""" or """"product"""" regulation goes to the heart of the regulatory state already in early modern times. Old formulas such as the """"protection of life and health'' can be found throughout the centuries. In more modern times, public authorities were concerned with such diverse matters as fire protection, accident prevention, building codes, industrial safety, weights and measures, pollution control, sanitation and sewage, etc. The so-called """"police-power'' of the state covers these and other fields in principle, and it is a matter of politics which problem to take up, how to perceive and administer it. This is not to say, however, that """"the state"""" must exercise its duty in a specific way. As a matter of fact, the politics of regulation centers around the question how farreaching the state should intervene, or whether selfgovernment in regulatory matters is more appropriate. Technically, any regulation needs two essentials: regulatory bodies (personnel) and standards of regulations. Public authorities in charge of regulation are to be found on the federal, state and local level; they may include special branches of public administration, individuals as experts commissions and institutions like Testing Bureaus o Government Labs. On the other side industry is marshallin: interests and expertise for purposes of private regulation Trade associations, professional societies, insurancl companies and industrial inspection services claim efficien and appropriate regulatory self-government, if only tc prevent governme_nt interference.

Cloud solution is ideal for a small or limited service hotel. Cloud services are faster and more efficient ways to improves customer service by decreasing waiting times and providing a more personalized service on arrival. Cloud systems decrease the cost of entry to hotels and provide an extended arm of computer power which makes the service unilaterally accessible and can be summarized through these primary benefits. This research concentrated on how local hotel brands compete with international hotel chains by using case studies of a budget hotel chain business in Thailand. Qualitative analysis was conducted through 20 hotel branches. The research results were constructed the integrated cloud computing model for budget hotels to optimize operating costs, increasing process efficiency, and customer satisfaction.	cloud computing;computer data storage;data center;download;personalization;power supply unit (computer);requirement;technical support	Niran Chawla	2014	2014 IEEE World Congress on Services	10.1109/SERVICES.2014.78	marketing;operations management;advertising;business	Arch	-73.44242393021756	4.11214758852898	86637

7ca7c095457375b5fb874c3265d02d66884a2768	book review: david stern, how libraries make tough choices in difficult times: purposeful abandonment		This book largely extols the virtues of a Japanese Kaizen-style approach to management, which focuses on aspects of a Total Quality Management approach, and, although not outwardly referring to this, utilizes it as a way of dealing with the current challenges in modern libraries. The author stresses the importance of a logical, orderly approach to library management, which encompasses a project management focus and involves all stakeholders, in addition to using the mission/vision as the foundation stone for all planning and development. The book is United States based, and the author comes from a largely academic library background, although many of the concepts can be applied in a variety of library environments. Essentially the book is examining an approach which all good management training aspires to: one which has a clear purpose, and enables a responsive, efficient and effective service delivery. It is a practical guide, aimed at both experienced and inexperienced managers, which considers suitable practice, in addition to providing suitable case studies of successful approaches. Although the book says nothing new, it is interesting to consider in the library context, and useful reading is provided on topics such as measurement and improvement of library services, and tools to facilitate this. Chapter 1 considers the role of the organizational review in times of economic crisis, and the importance of measuring user satisfaction, and gaining staff involvement in such a process. Transparent communication is seen as the key to the successful implementation of such a review at all stages, in addition to clear and transparent project management processes. There is a useful chapter on how to prepare for such a review, which indeed the author views as something that should not simply be a knee-jerk reaction to economic challenges, but more a regular quality-enhancing process of the wider organization. There is also a useful case study which considers the difference between an organization’s mission and vision, and how vital stakeholder involvement is to goal setting and planning in order to obtain sufficient ‘buy-in’. Staff engagement through meaningful two-way communication and wider stakeholder involvement are seen as key factors in successful implementation. A chapter identifying key analysis techniques focuses primarily on the role that project management has to play. The identification of the actual problems, the ‘why’ of doing any review, are seen as vital. ‘Interest-based problem solving’ is suggested as a useful tool for dealing with sensitive issues, in order to aid the unpicking of possible resistance to review initiatives, and tackle possible concerns and misunderstandings. By displaying goals, operations and interests as a visual chart, the manager can start to examine how employees’ interests align with organizational interests, and start to move forward positively and sensitively. Service quality improvement is considered as an ongoing philosophy of continuous service review and enhancement, and provides the underpinning for these techniques. Such a philosophy very much mirrors a Japanese-style approach to management, and aims to cover all aspects of the service whether they are failing or not. It is viewed by the author as something that should be second nature to an organization, with full management support in order to ensure the necessary conditions exist for such a process to thrive. There are less useful chapters covering the importance of data collection for assisting in evidence-based analysis, and the need to stay focused on the bigger picture when planning for best practice. However, a later chapter usefully details key leadership skills required for managers who wish to facilitate this approach of continuous service quality improvement. A valid point is made that a manager is only as successful as his/her team. The author concludes by stressing that managers ‘Do’ need to take action, be accessible and constantly refine and improve services and morale. Although this book does not supply the answer to the question in its title, it does provide discussion of how a wider service quality enhancement approach can facilitate a more robust and responsive organization in what is an increasingly challenging environment.

In this article, we approach this relationship from a new angle by developing a scorecard allowing measurement of more specific dimensions of Computerization and Centralization. To develop this management tool called CSS (Computerization and Centralization Scorecard), we relied on research conducted within the Swiss public administrations, especially regarding the digitization of registers of persons. The development of this tool followed a first descriptive analysis model developed to treat semi-structured interviews we conducted with various stakeholders in our research.	cascading style sheets;causality;organizational behavior;semiconductor industry;switzerland	Jose Formaz;Olivier Glassey	2013	2013 46th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2013.395	public relations;centralized government;public administration;management	SE	-74.21512066704223	0.6639110631002147	87047

5d597e6a097c08a63be81f27a000b09986313f96	social networks evolving into service platforms - the facebook-case from a business model viewpoint	business model;social network	Considering Facebook as one of the most successful social networking platforms turning into a service-platform model, this case study indicates the reasons for this success from a business model point of view. The first section introduces a business model concept based on the latest research. Afterwards the concept has been applied to specify the most important elements of this business model case. This contribution focusses on the value proposition, the target customers, the platformservice and the financial domain of the social network case. According to the official Facebook-site, the social network platform Facebook currently counts 400 million active users worldwide. 50 percent of the active users visit the site once a day. According to [Bag10], the time visitors spent on popular sites like heise.de is approximately 6 pages, whereas the Facebook visits include 15 pages averagely. This means the site is not used for short stays but serves as a place for comparatively long-time browsing activities. Already in July 2008, the New York Times explained that the value of Facebook would be somewhere between $3.75 billion and $15 billion. Nevertheless, due to the stock-absence of Facebook, the company does not publicly disclose its financial results. We consider the Facebook-platform to be a success story with one of the most mature business models in the social networking area. Therefore this paper outlines the Facebook-platform from a business model viewpoint. Although privacy protection is generally considered as very important for the Facebook business, this paper explicitly does not cover this technical and processual issue. In the following section a business model concept based on current literature is introduced. Afterwards the concept is applied to the Facebook case and the paper concludes by indicating the most important elements of this business model case and giving a perspective on future trends. 1 Business model research A business model includes an abstraction of a company’s business logic and provides an aerial view on several elements of a business like value proposition, target customers, revenues stream and processes.

Recently, securing and monitoring the deployed enterprise infrastructure systems has taken unprecedented importance due to the added accountability now being placed on managing corporate data and private information. Compliance with new regulation has never been stressed more than now – with SOX/Bill 198, GLB Act/PIPDEA, HIPPA to name a few regulations. To w a r d this, we present RegColl: A practical framework for registry and system configuration management for monitoring and maintaining the health of corporate infrastructure systems in Windows environment. In RegColl, registry and configuration information are collected at a centralized location so as to inspect and analyze the data for policy compliance, system configuration monitoring, and incident response services.	centralized computing;compiler;computer security incident management;configuration management;digital millennium copyright act;health insurance portability and accountability act;microsoft windows;personally identifiable information;scalability;system administrator;system configuration;systems management	Brent ByungHoon Kang;Vikram Sharma;Pratik Thanki	2005			systems management;private information retrieval;computer science;environmental resource management;sociology;law;computer security	OS	-71.64075539889961	-8.093567797169962	87643

This paper aims to examine the implications of knowledge management for security. Design/methodology/approach – This approach highlights the competitive advantage of knowledge with an emphasis on security. This paper reviews security for data and information and explores the dimensions of secure knowledge systems. The emphasis is on knowledge security and the development of future knowledge management systems. Findings – This paper finds that there exists a general lack of focus on security in the knowledge management framework – both in a research setting and in practical applications. Knowledge is different from information and data and needs special consideration in firms. Research implications/limitations – Designers of knowledge management systems can implement levels of security for different types of knowledge that reside within the organization. The concept of ‘‘secure knowledge management’’ has provided nascent models to address the management and protection of knowledge resources. Information systems researchers that are investigating knowledge have to include the protection and security of knowledge. Originality/value – Knowledge management has moved to the forefront of both the research and corporate agendas. Harnessing the information and knowledge contained within firm data warehouses is one method to achieve competitive advantage. Various types of knowledge require different solutions. Designers of knowledge management systems can implement levels of security for different types of knowledge that reside within the organization. Future developments need to address securing the knowledge of a corporation, its most valuable asset.	information system;knowledge management;knowledge-based systems;microsoft forefront	Ebrahim Randeree	2006	J.

We present a case study of an urban Australian e-waste recycling social enterprise (Substation33) that engages volunteers and welfare recipients in the Work for The Dole program in technology disassembly, repair, and making activities. Bringing these people together in shared making practices has resulted in a high degree of diversity in the organisationu0027s structure, mission, activities, and workforce. We identify and discuss four key factors that establish a sense of coherence using Lave and Wengeru0027s `Communities of Practiceu0027 lens: the interdependence of activities, characteristics of the space, social relationships through peer learning, and community rules and expectations. We contribute to the discussion on new configurations of personal making and industrial production, and advocate for extending conceptualisations of hackerspaces to be more inclusive of hybrid organisations that serve the needs of people from low socioeconomic communities.	computer recycling;disassembler;dole air race;electronic waste;human–computer interaction;interdependence;reflections of signals on conducting lines;reification (knowledge representation);scott continuity	Jennyfer Lawrence Taylor;Dhaval Vyas;Tony Sharp	2017		10.1145/3152771.3152797	multimedia;computer science;community of practice;peer learning;socioeconomics;hacker;socioeconomic status;workforce;industrial production;welfare	HCI	-70.1554935227606	-5.7047834682013425	87990

The Internet has evolved to a point where it has become possible to develop a business model completely based on Web advertising, which is important for the consolidation of such a model and the continuity of the Internet itself. However, it is often observed that some content publishers are dishonest and employ automated tools to generate traffic and profit by defrauding advertisers. Similarly, some advertisers use automated tools to click on the ads of their competitors, aiming to exhaust the budget of the competitor's marketing departments. In this paper, differently of recent click fraud detection mechanisms, that take place after the fraud has already occurred, we propose an approach for preventing automated click-fraud, based on the use of click able CAPTCHAs.	captcha;click fraud;clickable;computer;data validation;http cookie;internet;online advertising;scott continuity;semiconductor consolidation	Rodrigo Alves Costa;Ruy J.

c126e0368c3d1da9722294b20ffda9d1f0b64242	a system for analyzing and visualizing business solutions provided by information technology companies in japan	information technology	The corporate world has become environmentally active to comply with regulations and meet voluntary targets. In Europe, regulations concerning chemical materials in products have been stepped up, requiring exporters and companies that make up their supply chains to become involved in environmental activities. At the same time, some companies have come to see that environmentally conscious products can help make a company more competitive and are incorporating environmental activities in management. As the scope and volume of a company’s environmentrelated business continue to expand, more companies can be expected to introduce environmental business solutions with the aim of making environment-related business more efficient and creating mechanisms for applying environmental information to management activities. This paper describes functions required of environmental business solutions and the effects of introducing them divided into three fields: Environmental Management System (EMS), support for environmental-load reduction activities for places of business, and support for environmental-load reduction activities for products.	environmental resource management;global variable;management system	Kei Nishimura;Koichi Kato;Yoichi Muraoka	2004			marketing;operations management;business;commerce	HCI	-72.7740917639242	3.7615906393412684	88125

Following two decades of financial pressure and retrenchment, public and academic libraries are benefiting from recent government initiatives recognizing and developing their potential; several examples are given. These initiatives have enabled libraries to develop facilities, services and resources beyond the scope of their traditional sources of income, and have fostered new partnerships between libraries and other bodies, both public and private. However, as funding flows to projects and initiatives, cautions on two areas of concern. Firstly, government policy objectives may distort professional priorities, and changes in political climate can alter the specific allocation of resources. Secondly, a method of continuous funding is needed for maintenance of core services and to enable successful projects to be carried forward.

They were the ones that pioneered the development of innovative knowledge management systems, they were at the forefront of creating knowledge management cultures and they recognized the productive potential of knowledge workers. While knowledge continues to be prominent on the strategic agenda of leading consulting firms, several knowledge management challenges remain unsolved. To shed light on this matter the paper aims to investigate how knowledge management is really embedded in their organizations and with which critical issues these firms still struggle . #R##N##R##N#Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents a qualitative empirical study based on 37 in-depth interviews with representatives from international consulting firms in different locations around the world. #R##N##R##N#Findings – It is found that the promise of knowledge management can only be realized if people are open to changing business processes and adopt new ways of thinking. #R##N##R##N#Practical implictions – The study sheds fresh light on the knowledge management practices that have emerged in the consulting industry, and provides insights into the interplay of people and systems, the structuring of knowledge management, the divide between knowledge generalists and specialists, and the knowledge management strategy. #R##N##R##N#Originality/value – The paper presents a general approach to embedding knowledge management along the dimensions of people, systems and business processes and develops an integrative framework that links knowledge management strategies to a typical consulting project cycle. In addition, it sheds light on individual perceptions on the benefits from knowledge management.		Tina C. Ambos;Bodo B. Schlegelmilch	2009	J.

Global practice shows that many IRs are managed by academic libraries and librarians. This paper examined the nexus between libraries and IRs. It observed that though the emergence of IRs holds great advantage for academic institutions, many Nigerian institutions especially Universities do not have functional IRs because of the inability of their libraries to run them. The paper further identified digital divide, inadequate finance, lack of ICT skills and awareness as well as copyright issues as challenges inhibiting the establishment and management of IRs in Nigeria. It made recommendations for dealing with the identified challenges.		Goodluck Ifijeh;Oyeronke Adebayo;Roland Izuagbe;Olajumoke Olawoyin	2018	J. Cases on Inf.

Specifically, the current study examines the nature of agricultural innovation of the two countries and considers agricultural R&D investments and activities as well as the roles of university, industry, and government (UIG), which are the three units comprising the triple helix. As an empirical extension of the qualitative analysis, we collected bibliometric information of agricultural scientific publications from 1990 to 2010 and patent information from 1980 to 2010. By calculating transmission of uncertainty, which indicates collaboration among UIG, this paper tracks the relationship dynamics of the units comprising the triple helix. In addition, we analyze topics in scientific publications and patents in order to observe and compare the subareas that are the focus in the two countries. The findings reveal both commonalities and differences between the two countries, thus providing knowledge of and insights into the agricultural sector.	bibliometrics;scientific literature	Haneul Kim;Minghao Huang;Furong Jin;David Bodoff;Junghoon Moon;Young Chan Choe	2011	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-011-0517-4	marketing;economy;triple helix;economic growth;china	NLP	-76.60258838964639	-6.720175253707935	91034

Although this tradition does not represent a coherent set of principles and methods for system development, they share some common ideas and goals related to user involvement, participatory design and democracy at the work place. Even if some of the most basic ideas are inherent in our understanding of the IS field to day, many of the lessons from the past may have been forgotten. Some do also claim that the dominant understanding of eGovernment nicely conforms to the perspectives and goals of the New Public Management paradigm. I will rather argue that advanced development and use of ICT can support the ideals and goals of the Scandinavian approaches to IS; we should not least have a greater focus on studying the consequences of various approaches to system design, implementation and use.	coherence (physics);information system;programming paradigm;systems design	Arild Jansen	2006		10.1007/11823100_5	artificial intelligence;operations research;computer security;information system;systems design	HCI	-76.27886946678204	-2.5376968727142604	91165

To date, research has documented examples of hugely successful citizen science projects, such as Zooniverse and eBird, but citizen science also includes hundreds of smaller citizen science and functionally similar digital humanities projects, operating from small-scale web platforms and in-person collaborative teams. Yet, it is unclear what the """"science"""" of citizen science entails: What are the core research questions and methodologies for answering them? What theories and concepts have been associated with citizen science research to date? What are the technology needs for supporting successful research collaboration among diverse stakeholders and across distinctive types of citizen science projects? In this workshop, our goal is to (i) bring together researchers studying citizen science to form a coherent map summarizing the theories, methodologies and platforms that currently defines citizen science research, with a special focus on CHI and CSCW relevant topics (ii) brainstorm a list of fundamental open questions and ways to tackle them, and (iii) form a multidisciplinary community to build synergies for further collaboration."""	brainstorm;chi;citizen science;coherence (physics);computer-supported cooperative work;digital humanities;synergy;theory;zooniverse;ebird	Edith Law;Alex C.

The study takes a qualitative case study approach, and participants are employees at the Research u0026 Development department of a multinational original brand manufacturer. The article makes an important contribution to organisational information security management. It addresses the behaviour of organisational insiders – a group whose role in the prevention, response and mitigation of information security incidents is critical.

8b0a60ceffc5b0c9f305058d46307424c4819831	on the relevance of blockchain in identity management		The ubiquitous application of emerging blockchain technology in numerous technological projects leads to a tremendous hype. The significantly high prices of digital currencies and initial coin offerings as the new funding approach has fostered the public perception of blockchain as a cure-all and driven the hype even further. In this evolution, a clear view of the reasonable application of blockchain technology is not given and therefore, the purposeful use of traditional technologies is undermined. To clarify this situation, we derive a novel decision model for evaluating the applicability of blockchain technology that considers two key factors: the remediation of central governance and the management of digital objects. Based on these key factors, we closely analyse the domain of identity management for conscious blockchain application. Finally, we examine uPort, Sovrin, and ShoCard as distinct projects in this scope with regard to the inevitable necessity to implement a blockchain by using our decision model.	bitcoin;centralisation;correctness (computer science);digital currency;digital identity;identity management;identity provider;relevance;solution architecture;trusted third party	Andreas Grüner;Alexander Mühle;Christoph Meinel	2018	CoRR		computer security;data science;perception;decision model;identity management;computer science;blockchain;digital currency;corporate governance	HCI	-76.33727188523474	-5.109768946610115	91344
88b833d9425d695b06bbc188f91119058529a323	a knowledge management model to improve the development of bushfire communication products		This paper brings together two bodies of literature around knowledge management (KM) as enterprise integration (EI) and organisational ontology and epistemology as philosophy, in order to develop an extended KM approach to the development of bushfire preparedness material in the Australian context. Knowledge Management (KM) in enterprise integration (EI) practice manifests as process-centric electronic document and records management solutions. Knowledge creation and organisational epistemology is viewed as a social process, but this is often left unrepresented by KM processes. The body of literature on KM tends to focus on organisational functionality and organisational KM that is based on EI ontology tends to be restricted by organisational functionality and process models. We argue that developing the KM-Model using subjectivist epistemology has a significant role in KM and organisational studies for emergency and disaster agencies. As part of the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) ‘Effective Communication and Communities’ project, bushfire communication materials were collected from all Australian States and Territories and analysed using NVivo, representing a knowledge base. Data sources including semi-structured interviews with bushfire agency staff and residents in bushfire-prone localities. Interview data was analysed using thematic analysis, and emergent themes were represented using UML as a platform independent representation of the extended knowledge domain that is capable of representation in a digital space. This work unites organisational ontology, organisational epistemology and EI; the different manifestations of KM. We theorise about how organisational epistemology itself forms as part of the knowledge, where currently there is a lacking of a satisfactory end-to-end framework. The KM lifecycle, therefore, is extended by incorporating the social research processes as part of organisational epistemology to include external audiences through the themes of locality types, place and roles of individuals as volunteers and agency staff. The practical implications are that qualitative methods and toolsets can be included as part of KM to improve the development and deployment of bushfire preparedness material.	binary prefix;computational epistemology;cyclic redundancy check;emergence;end-to-end principle;enterprise integration;knowledge base;knowledge management;locality of reference;organizational behavior;semiconductor industry;software deployment;the australian;unified modeling language	Keith Koon Teng Toh;Brian J.

The economic deregulation of the transportation industry and transport market had a tremendous impact on the practice of intermodal transport. For intermodal transport to be sustainable it has to be efficient. The pursuit of intermodal transport development is sustainability especially from financial and environmental aspect. Therefore, intermodal terminals are to be planned and developed according to planned and accomplished sustainability. Intermodal terminal as crucial traffic infrastructure elements are designed to ensure adequate facilities for cargo handling, decreased occurrence of cargo damage, reduced transit time and have affordable dues to attract a maximum traffic flow. Benefits of intermodal transport has to be presented to transport decision makers through information, consulting, promotion, marketing and training activities and education as well.	new foundations;telematics	Ryszard J.

Initial attention was paid to functional interdependencies among infrastructure systems regardless of locational characteristics. Using electric power as a focal point, geographic interdependencies are evaluated, that is, outages that spread across several states rather than being confined to single states. The analysis evaluates the extent to which the two different groups have distinct characteristics. The characteristics examined include incident counts, number of customers lost, duration and energy unserved. Data are drawn from the Disturbance Analysis Working Group (DAWG) database, which is maintained by the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), and from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).	focal (programming language);interdependence;scart	Carlos E.

From a system designer’s perspective, in order to achieve better user experience in these applications, we should take both the efficiency and fairness of a dating market into consideration, so as to increase the overall satisfaction for all users. Towards this goal, we investigate the nature of diminishing marginal returns for online dating markets (i.e., captured by the submodularity), and trade-off between the efficiency and fairness of the market with Nash social welfare. We further design effective online algorithms to the apps. We verify our models and algorithms through sound theoretical analysis and empirical studies by using real data and show that our algorithms can significantly improve the ecosystems of the online dating applications.

It is widely considered the key to product usefulness and usability---an effective approach to overcoming the limitations of traditional system-centered design. Much has been written in the research literature about UCD. As further proof of internationally endorsed best practice, UCD processes are also defined in ISO documents, including ISO 13407 and the associated technical report, ISO TR 18529. Increasingly, UCD has become part of the cultural vernacular of the executives and managers who drive technology development in companies of all sizes.	best practice;iteration;requirement;scientific literature;usability;user-centered design	Ji-Ye Mao;Karel Vredenburg;Paul W.

A deeper insight into the relationships between critical infrastructures enables the actors involved to more quickly understand the severity of information technology disruptions and to identify robust cross-functional mitigating actions. This study illustrates how and why disruptions in the payment system in Sweden could create cascading effects in other critical infrastructures with potentially severe consequences for many citizens, government institutions and companies. Data from document studies, interviews and workshops with field experts reveal seven challenges for collective cross-functional critical infrastructure resilience that need to be dealt with: 1) Shortage of food, fuel, cash, medicine; 2) Limited capacity of alternative payment solutions; 3) Cities are more vulnerable than the countryside; 4) Economically vulnerable groups in society are more severely affected; 5) Trust maintenance needs; 6) Crisis communication needs; 7) Fragmentation of responsibility for critical infrastructures across many actors.	cash;fragmentation (computing);iscram;quantum entanglement	Joeri van Laere;Peter Berggren;Per M.

The elapsed time between start-up and completion of implementation will be 7.5 years. The Start-Up and Planning phases of the project are complete. The Implementation phase asks one question: How does an organization create an environment that redirects and coordinates a variety of individual activities so that they come together to provide an IAIMS? Four answers to this question are being tested. First, design resources to be """"scalable""""--i.e., capable of supporting enterprise-wide use. Second, provide information technology planning activities as ongoing core functions that direct local efforts. Third, design core infrastructure resources to be both reusable and expandable at the local level.

Without a doubt, in computer security the risks are high, and the problems and their solutions are complex; nonetheless, the emphasis of this attention has been misplaced. The emphasis should be primarily on the security of information itself and secondarily on the devices that handle information and on any of the other factors that go into information production. The factors of information production should certainly be considered, but only after planning and analysis based on information has been completed. For example, when considering the possibility that a competitor may steal your firm's proprietary information, it is best to consider first what information should be safequarded and what expenditure is warranted for such protection; then one can consider the environments in which this information appears (paper-based, computerized, verbal, etc.) and controls that are appropriate for these environments. This paper explores the application to the information security area of Information Resource Management (IRM), a new and promising approach that concentrates, on information not on computers. This paper explains the concepts underlying IRM, how they are applied, and what general information systems benefits can be obtained. In a more specifically security-oriented sense, it indicates how IRM can help address a few of the pressing problems now encountered by information security practitioners: controls suboptimization, the Maginot Line syndrome, top management understanding and support, disaster recovery planning, security policy-making, consideration of noncomputerized information, and expeditious resolution of security problems.

Ethiopia is interested in creating access to agricultural knowledge through an agricultural knowledge management system (AKMS). Such a system has been developed using a web-based portal named Ethiopian Agriculture Portal (EAP). It is facilitated through Woreda Knowledge Centers (WKCs) which are in 10 Pilot Learning Woredas (PLW). Providing knowledge in the appropriate format, identification of affordable technological infrastructure, and integrating indigenous agricultural knowledge into the knowledge system is vital to empowering development agents (extension workers) in Ethiopia. This study addresses two research questions: 1)To what extent does the centralized AKMS support WKCs access and utilization of agricultural knowledge? 2) How can the existing AKMS support capturing and sharing of indigenous agricultural knowledge and best practices?	best practice;centralized computing;knowledge management;knowledge-based systems;management system;web application	Monica J.

In this paper, the author proposes that this new PMP should be the target of information systems science, and knowledge compression by the factorization of similar systems in diverse areas is one of its main tasks. In addition, this paper proposes a new academic discipline, semistry, that contributes to a solution side by side with the visual language EPN-PNUT, an extension of the Petri net, which represents our world by a set of local transition rules and tokens.	euref permanent network;information system;langton's loops;our world;petri net;production (computer science);semiconductor industry;systems science;visual language	Toshinori Watanabe	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/SMC.2013.832	information science;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;machine learning;petri net;information system	Robotics	-66.33876144039436	3.228965110048581	94035

Especially in Rome, where quite a million citizens per day uses TPL, any interruption in the public services can cause severe deterioration in urban life quality, congestion, compromised mobility and accessibility and enhanced pollution. Moreover TPL, and particularly subways, has been (remember the tragic facts in London subway on July 7th 2005) and still can be a target for terrorist threats and attacks. Therefore security must be considered as a crucial component in TPL services offer. Nevertheless lessons learnt from our experience, have suggested to apply some enhancements to the “classical” security model to switch the security operator from a mostly passive to a quite pro-active role and from a reaction to occurred events to preemptive actions. In other words, the role of security operators has to move from simple passive control (e.g. “see” events) in real-time, transferring data to stakeholders and ensuring timely decision-making without unnecessary steps in the communication chain. This paper will show how the advanced security services provided by our “PANDORA” system can enable this paradigm evolution. The “PANDORA” system is funded by the Italian Infrastructure and Transportation Ministry within the program framework of TPL security enhancement in the largest Italian cities.	accessibility;bus (computing);computer security model;e-services;interrupt;network congestion;on-board data handling;pandora;programming paradigm;real-time locating system;representation oligonucleotide microarray analysis	Pierluigi Pelargonio;Marco Pugliese	2014	2014 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST)	10.1109/CCST.2014.6986969	control system security;certified information security manager;cloud computing security;security management;security information and event management;security engineering;environmental resource management;information security;security service;transport engineering;business;network security policy;computer security;information security management	Security	-64.00489716707214	3.555141979220619	94121
69f7ff1548175c2bab43c871a81b659c33e2fb4c	implementing a classification scheme for enterprise 2.0	information management	Enterprise 2.0 is a broad term. It comprises not only the diverse applications of social software in organisations, but also the cultural and organisational change along with them. A generally accepted classification scheme that covers the diverse aspects of specific social software solutions had not yet been established. Such a classification scheme would be helpful to clarify young terms like Enterprise 2.0 or social software and to establish a common understanding. In this paper we present a classification scheme and how it was developed. Through a literature analysis of publications from academia and practice and of keywords used in online case study sites, 37 classification categories were derived. Based on a survey, 13 classification categories were chosen to be implemented in a web-based case study platform, and their value ranges were determined. Round about 100 case studies in the Enterprise 2.0 Case Study Network e20cases.org have been tagged accordingly and can be easily used for search and retrieval. In this article we describe selected categories in more detail: objectives, fields of application and success factors as well as barriers in the implementation process of Enterprise 2.0 in organizations, as they are not self-explanatory.	enterprise 2.0	Andrea Back;Peter Irmler	2012	it - Information Technology	10.1524/itit.2012.0684	enterprise systems engineering;enterprise software;computer science;knowledge management;data mining;database;management science;computer security;enterprise information system	HPC	-76.32683149584777	0.027987732321521425	94126
44ed4f0c9ee795fe2ad8fc2fda2f2dcd4742e182	comparison of regulatory challenges faced by different microgrid ownership models		Microgrids are a proposed solution for several issues arising in the current energy system. Advancements in different distributed energy resources and macro-level policy targets, such as grid resiliency and sustainability, support the adoption of microgrids in suitable contexts. Since microgrids would change the structure and roles in the grid significantly, regulations, which were created for the existing structures, would have to be updated. Main challenges lie in unclear legal definition of microgrids and their liabilities and responsibilities. Technical as well as economic challenges are related to interconnection and island mode rules and tariff setting. DSO microgrid ownership minimizes these challenges and is therefore the model that is currently easiest to adopt. However, as a result of technology and business model advancements, more demanding third-party and hybrid ownership models are becoming popular, and are expected to play an important role in the future microgrid arena.

b6b8d18b7ada6d618b4498727ab99ca3af1a9be7	chinese sociocultural perspectives and creativity: design practices in the public transport sector		Creativity in China in the current era of globalization has become a buzzword for industry, acting as a catalyst for innovative potential and investment. However, while ‘Made in China’ has long been established, ‘Created in China’ still requires some legitimization internationally, and alongside creativity comes the need for a more nuanced, cross-cultural perspective in design and manufacturing alike. The ‘Belt and Road’ initiative is one key national plan in this larger globalization-oriented process and the high speed train, which has been referred to as China’s ‘national identity card’, plays a symbolic role in this initiative. Exporting public transport systems, e.g. high speed trains, to international markets inevitably brings with it the challenge of cross-cultural issues, due to the different cultural background of prospective passengers. The nature of creativity itself bears an intrinsic link with one’s worldview, as the act of creating is variable in different perspectives. While a particular social setting in one country or society may be historically aligned with concepts of creativity or idea-generation, that same social setting elsewhere may be viewed as a deterrent or hindrance. The importance of cross-cultural perceptions of creativity in the realm of idea-generation as related to design thus requires a thorough examination. As the conditions and need for growth in innovative thinking grows, the need to understand creativity as it is understood from a Chinese lens becomes a timely area of focus. This paper will examine the relationship between culture and creativity, as evidenced by a study on employees of a publicly owned transportation company in Mainland China.		Sara E.

A systematic literature review was conducted to understand how the topic of gender equity promotion via collaboratively used IT artefacts has been addressed in extant research. Insights from the literature review, overview of existing related IT artefacts, and iterative discussions with scholars in the IT field have resulted in a set of requirements to the idea crowdsourcing platform aimed at the promotion of gender equity in IT research institutions. These requirements were analysed further and could be categorised into those specific for the target platform and those relevant also for other idea crowdsourcing platforms (with or without further adaptation). This study addresses a novel and important research topic and might be of value for practitioners.	crowdsourcing;equity crowdfunding;iteration;requirement;systematic review	Elena Gorbacheva;Benjamin Barann	2017				HCI	-76.83879351706452	-0.5041942940152775	95219
0dbfd5850e801d27ad345c6a88f55c0b3db22b30	toward a theory of network gatekeeping: a framework for exploring information control	information theory	Gatekeeping theories have been a popular heuristic for describing information control for years, but none have attained a full theoretical status in the context of networks. This paper aims to propose a theory of Network Gatekeeping comprised of two components: Identification and Salience. Network Gatekeeping Identification lays out vocabulary and naming foundations through the identification of gatekeepers, gatekeeping and gatekeeping mechanisms. Network Gatekeeping Salience, which is built on the bases of the Network Identification Theory, utilizes this infrastructure to understand relationships among gatekeepers and between gatekeepers and gated, the entity subjected to a gatekeeping process. Network Gatekeeping Salience proposes identifying gated and their salience to gatekeepers by four attributes (1) their political power in relation to the gatekeeper; (2) their information production ability; (3) their relationship with the gatekeeper; and (4) their alternatives in the context of gatekeeping.	biconnected component;conceptualization (information science);context switch;contingency (philosophy);diagram;emoticon;existential quantification;gatekeeper;heuristic;inferring horizontal gene transfer;information science;interaction;internet censorship circumvention;multitier architecture;refinement (computing);scott continuity;theory;vocabulary	Karine Nahon	2008	JASIST	10.1002/asi.20857	social science;information theory;statistics	AI	-68.44220725397278	-8.249174980119497	95287

The majority can be classified as adopting a unitary, objective perspective. This fails to fully recognise the interpretative, inter-subjective nature of information and the importance of informal as well as formal data processing systems. This paper aims to contribute to the discussion on tools and methods for systems development by providing a contrasting perspective on information requirements analysis as a process which is socially mediated. A framework is developed which places information requirements in the context strategic IS development. This features social communication networks centrally in this process and raises implications for practice in IS development.	information system;intersubjectivity;requirement;requirements analysis;software development process;telecommunications network;unitarity (physics)	Robert D.

Unlike the classical capacity scaling policies, the proposed hybrid capacity scaling policy is determined using multiple performance measures that reflect cost, internal stability and responsiveness. The impact of both tactical capacity and marketing policies and their interaction on the overall performance was analysed using DOE techniques and real case data. In addition to the different insights about the trade-offs involved in capacity planning decisions, the presented results challenged the conventional capacity planning wisdoms in MTO about the negative role of the capacity scalability delay time. Finally the analysis demonstrated the importance of inter-functional integration between capacity and marketing policies.

However, to date there are no business travel portals which support travelers over the holistic travel process -- before, during and after the trip. Thus, the aim of this work is to define the necessary clusters of services (building blocks) for a business travel portal that allows the traveler to satisfy his/her mobility needs by a single self-service portal. Through the structured analysis of business travel use cases this research identified seven building blocks to provide full support in all phases of the trip. Before the journey begins travelers have to be supported by routing (geographical routes and selection of adequate transport modes) and booking services. During the trip the travelers need navigation services, a real-time itinerary and payment tracking services. After the trip services for the travel expenses and a mobility reporting are required.	holism;multimodal interaction;portals;real-time transcription;requirement;routing;seamless3d;structured analysis;usability	Tobias Lenz;Heiko Gewald;Sascha Coccorullo	2015	2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2015.172	planning;computer science;marketing;travel behavior;advertising;management	Robotics	-64.31616258345441	2.839021789696502	97269

The goal of this research was to engage members of a local food community and generate volunteered geographic information (VGI) on community food assets. During active data collection, over 200 food assets were reported. This paper details the systematic approach used to create VGI, which emphasizes the socio-cultural context surrounding the mapping technology. The project began with an identified need to connect to and learn from the local food community. The participants were drawn from active food system stakeholders, and a Geoweb infrastructure was selected based on publicly available crowdsourcing tools. The resulting VGI is presented according to system functions: input (Web traffic, contributors, input types), management (contribution vetting, privacy), analysis (typology of input), and presentation (sharing the submitted data).

9a2a6f81019312205669ed98e7e3a20f66e050ca	managing complexity across multiple dimensions of liquid open data: the case of the danish basic data program		Current literature on open government data has uncovered a wide range of challenges related to these important initiatives. The problems encountered include: insufficient data quality and interoperability, problems regarding governance and motivation, lack of capabilities, and heterogeneous political and ideological agendas. A common open data infrastructure might resolve some of these problems, however, implementing such an infrastructure is a highly complex task. This longitudinal case study of the Danish Basic Data Program (BDP) is intended to improve our understanding of the challenges related to providing open access to government data through open data infrastructure. The BDP aims to improve the quality of selected government data, make them more coherent, and improve accessibility through the implementation of a common data distribution platform. The program is expected to increase government efficiency and stimulate innovation. This case study describes the evolution of the BDP and identifies the main structural elements of an open data infrastructure. Data analysis uncovered four tensions, which are identified as key challenges of an open data infrastructure implementation. These tensions are presented with four suggested governance strategies that were used in the BDP case. The main contribution of the paper is a process model where the main phases and mechanisms of an open data infrastructure implementation, use and impacts are identified and explained.

e800ec89d7bb7252771ffc21467dba4d854dc249	dialectic tensions in the financial markets: a longitudinal study of pre- and post-crisis regulatory technology		This article presents the findings from a longitudinal research study on regulatory technology in the UK financial services industry. The financial crisis with serious corporate and mutual fund scandals raised the profile of compliance as governmental bodies, institutional and private investors introduced a ‘tsunami’ of financial regulations. Adopting a multi-level analysis, this study examines how regulatory technology was used by financial firms to meet their compliance obligations, pre- and post-crisis. Empirical data collected over 12 years examine the deployment of an investment management system in eight financial firms. Interviews with public regulatory bodies, financial institutions and technology providers reveal a culture of compliance with increased transparency, surveillance and accountability. Findings show that dialectic tensions arise as the pursuit of transparency, surveillance and accountability in compliance mandates is simultaneously rationalized, facilitated and obscured by regulatory technology. Responding to these challenges, regulatory bodies continue to impose revised compliance mandates on financial firms to force them to adapt their financial technologies in an ever-changing multi-jurisdictional regulatory landscape.

External pressures force national security concerns to conflict with the values and interests of private enterprise and academic freedom. This paper has two primary objectives: the first is to present the computing community with a reasonably equitable and detailed perspective on this important public policy problem; the second is to present and analyze a range of policy choices.

This paper identifies literature, technological advances and current thinking on electronic consent (eConsent). Key issues for health care providers (HCP) and consumers are distilled through a content analysis of a cross section of news reports for the year June 2005 to May 2006. For the study we selected countries that are in the process of adopting shared electronic health records, and took the approach of using media analysis. The press is a professional critic as defined by Sauer and Wilcox (2007). The topic of electronic consent (eConsent) is closely aligned with issues of information privacy and related legislation, patient rights, and national culture. Clearly, technology is central to the implementation of eConsent and there are pressing management and security issues to be addressed. This paper will make clear the relationships between these fields of study and comment on the ‘state of play’ in integrated electronic health record systems today, outlining potential pitfalls.	cross section (geometry);information privacy	Sophie Cockcroft	2008	International Journal of Internet and Enterprise Management	10.1504/IJIEM.2010.035625	public relations;information privacy;computer science;knowledge management;information security;data mining;database;management;world wide web	HCI	-72.20886705439257	-8.680627441596979	99482

Consideration of cultural fit, experience, ability to adapt to the company’s marketplace and ability to grow with the organisation all weigh heavily on the minds of most human resource professionals. This paper describes the development and progress of a solution with the ability to aid employers with these issues and at the same time to provide job seekers with an attractive and friendly environment for finding jobs. The Internet provides the medium for conducting the recruitment and selection process in an online environment. The proposed solution is to develop an integrated Electronic Job Marketplace offering a new service in the Internet job market: Online Interviewing for screening candidate employees. More specifically, in order to meet hiring objectives and control the increasing cost of recruiting, the conclusions of this project suggest that organisations should implement an online recruiting and selection process. The critical requirements of the new model are: eliminating paperwork, improving timeto-hire, reducing turnover, creating a resume and position-centric environment as well as using the Internet as a recruitment and selection tool	e-services;experience;internet;job stream;requirement	Georgios A.

09e80b7ac50e2c0603b523dd942e504853c3d136	evaluation of the effectiveness of risk assessment and security fatigue visualization model for internal e-crime		As the Internet has become ever more important infrastructure, the threat of electronic crime (e-crime) has increased. Thus, to counter threats to information security, many information security solutions have been introduced and security policies have been made stricter. However, the excessive strictness of these policies may lower the security consciousness of employees and cause the security policy to become a dead letter. The feeling caused by following such strict information security policies is called security fatigue. Security fatigue is gaining attention as a research issue; for example, a workshop was held at SOUPS, one of Usable Security's top conferences, and a report by NIST researchers was published. To contribute to this research, we have proposed a security condition matrix to visualize how IT users feel security fatigue with respect to security countermeasures. The security condition matrix is a two-dimensional model, with the security fatigue degree on the vertical axis and the security countermeasure implementation degree on the horizontal axis. By using this matrix, it becomes possible to visualize how dangerous a person is in terms of information security and facilitate security countermeasures in accordance with each condition on the matrix. In this paper, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed security fatigue model for internal e-crime.	apache axis;cybercrime;human–computer interaction (security);information security;internet;risk assessment;the matrix	Takashi Hatashima;Keita Nagai;Asami Kishi;Hikaru Uekusa;Shigeaki Tanimoto;Atsushi Kanai;Hitoshi Fuji;Kazuhiko Ohkubo	2018	2018 IEEE 42nd Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	10.1109/COMPSAC.2018.10323	the internet;password;risk management;systems engineering;computer security;feeling;information security;risk assessment;computer science;security policy;countermeasure	Security	-70.86964250602449	-8.28433276233011	100092

The paper presents critical realism and Derek Layder’s adaptive theory—this is based on the principles of critical realism—and exemplifies how they can be used in IS-research, for example, in theory development and evaluation research.	information system;social reality;theory	Sven A.

An often overlooked cause of privacy breaches is human error. In this study, we first apply a model based on the widely accepted GEMS error typology to analyze publicly reported privacy breach incidents within the U.S. Then, based on an examination of the causes of the reported privacy breach incidents, we propose a defense-in-depth solution strategy founded on error avoidance, error interception, and error correction. Finally, we illustrate the application of the proposed strategy to managing human error in the case of the two leading causes of privacy breach incidents. This study finds that mistakes in the information processing stage constitute the most cases of human errorrelated privacy breach incidents, clearly highlighting the need for effective policies and their enforcement in organizations. a 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Investigation of this suggests that ITS impacts in two, substantially different, ways. First, the presence of ITS can affect the evaluation per se and, secondly, the type of ITS application proposed can affect how projects involving ITS are evaluated (i.e., whether the evaluation should be a business case or SCBA). Each of these issues are addressed in turn in this paper. The arguments are illustrated using the example of real-time passenger information at bus stops.		Corinne Mulley;John D. Nelson	2000	J.

Changing climatic conditions and environmental deterioration has multi dimensional impact on every sphere of life forms and life form driving processes. Public hold on corporations responsible for ecological misconduct in their supply chains getting more firm with time. To counter the threat it’s a high time industries started taking initiatives for sustainability in their supply chains. In spite of that, suppliers often are unsuccessful to appropriately contribute in these initiatives. Hence, present paper justifies the supplier involvement in sustainable initiatives in supply chain management (SCM) with using differential evolution (DE) to select the efficient sustainable suppliers providing the maximum fulfillment for the sustainable criteria determined. Finally, two illustrative cases on automotive industry validate the application of the present approach.	differential evolution;evolution strategy	Sunil Kumar Jauhar;Millie Pant	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-32229-2_25	operations management;automotive engineering;business;manufacturing engineering	Crypto	-72.90661911247037	1.0200447874062426	100360

These systems include card-based systems in emergency despatch, the paper flight progress strips system used in air traffic control, the Kanban system and whiteboard systems used in hospital wards. Research to understand or replace these systems has frequently regarded them as decision support systems (DSS). We report here a detailed case study of a manual whiteboardbased bed allocation system in the ICU of a large general hospital, which shows that the support it provides for users’ action choices cannot be validly conceived as decision support. This system and other effective manual systems may be better understood as a ‘situated choice support system’ (SCSS). Whereas DSS provide actors with a model of the action environment in order to support reasoning about the consequences of alternative actions, SCSS provide actors with structured work environments that reduce possible actions and cue-providing information resources to support a reactive choice between these limited alternatives. The findings warn of the danger of uncritically applying the DSS design paradigm to supporting action choice in skilled routine work, and provide an alternative design theory, which can potentially inform new ICT-based designs.

However, the problem facing researchers is that there is a paucity of information on the application of hermeneutics for empirical research in the social sciences; indeed, there is very little guidance on what exactly constitutes a hermeneutic method for the investigation of social phenomena. In order to address this problem, this paper provides an overview of concepts and principles from the related philosophies of phenomenology and hermeneutics; it then illustrates their application in an interpretive case study on the information systems development process. The insights obtained from the application of the hermeneutic method outlined in this paper have helped realize the study's objective of illustrating the link between phenomenological hermeneutics and the conduct of interpretive research.	information system;software development process	Tom Butler	1998	JIT	10.1057/jit.1998.7	computer science;engineering;knowledge management;electrical engineering;management information systems;management science;sociology;operations research;information technology;information system	HCI	-71.59586662620133	1.9547387840816357	100566

Allen, we contribute to the emerging microlevel theory of knowledge recombination by examining how individual-level characteristics of inventors affect the breadth of their technological recombinations. Our data set combines information from 30,550 European patents with matched survey data obtained from 1,880 inventors. The analysis supports the view that inventors with a scientific education are more likely to generate patents that span technological boundaries (in our case, 30 broad, toplevel technological domains) than inventors with an engineering degree. A doctoral degree is associated with increased recombination breadth for all groups of inventors. The breadth of an inventor’s technological recombinations diminishes with increasing temporal distance to his education, but the differences between scientists and engineers persist over time. Our findings provide several new insights for research on inventors, the literature on organizational learning and innovation, and strategy research.	computer scientist;futures studies;technological singularity;temporal logic;value (ethics)	Marc Gruber;Dietmar Harhoff;Karin Hoisl	2013	Management Science	10.1287/mnsc.1120.1572	innovation;economics;management	HCI	-75.82633165239042	-3.3080006139910783	100647

Even though knowledge management practice is demanded in information society, it does not exist as a full-fledged solution in most organizations yet. The reality in IIUM library is that it already employs certain elements of knowledge management through the use of IT to support various activities from administrative jobs to user education. Among the IT support system used include: the staff intranet and email to share and exchange information, library database to capture and store data and the digital library facilities to serve the diverse interest of its numerous customers. These imply that the strategies employed by IIUM library include: intellectual asset management strategy, personal knowledge asset responsibility strategy and mostly customer-focused knowledge strategy.The purpose of this study lies in its concern for whether the elements of knowledge management involved in the administration of IIUM library is achieving the goals of knowledge management and whether the staff and customers of IIUM library are maximizing the benefits of knowledge management in information societies.

2ce8b00228b3df19ffd7019d1b1e5cdb66e21805	systems thinking: an analysis of key factors and relationships	systems thinking	Today’s work environment presents engineers with complex challenges that demand holistic approaches. Systems thinking provides ways to think about a problem and its solutions using “whole system” perspectives. There have been multiple studies that identify the key elements that comprise systems thinking. These studies have resulted in the identification of sets of individual systems thinking traits, elements, and characteristics. In this paper, the authors further explore and analyze individual systems thinking elements as well as the relationships between the various elements. The authors will present and discuss a model that illustrates the relationships between the elements related to individual systems thinking. © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

3e3f66a9c4a89f0bbfef771df1e5815026582615	linking service development methods to interoperability governance: the case of egypt	egypt;service development methods;government interoperability;interoperability governance;web services;g2g services	Abstract While administrations, and especially e-government “followers,” have been recommended adopting service-oriented architecture (SOA) for the purpose of implementing G2G interoperability, the challenges of reaching this objective remain significant. General guidelines for service development and SOA governance are published, but in view of many self-contained units and IT departments on all administrative levels as well as widespread outsourcing of software development there is a lack of sharing “best practices” how to implement SOA step by step in the area of e-government. In particular, it is unknown to what extent administrations are able to follow existing service development approaches, and there is no research addressing the contribution of service development methods towards governance, i.e. developing and managing government interoperability. In this research the case of Egypt, where SOA was chosen as the main interoperability approach, has been explored in terms of to what extent the current approach to service development supports the interoperability governance, and what kind of changes in the development methods and their application would yield improvements in interoperability governance. The case analysis on practical and strategic level leads to proposing success factors related to linking the methodology of developing G2G services to the overall effort of interoperability governance. These factors, divided into interoperability problem perception, method scoping and deliverables, measurement of goal achievement, and methodological commitment, can be used as hypotheses in future research and as guidelines for improving the interoperability governance in administrative practice.	disaster recovery plan;e-government;experience;interoperability;scope (computer science);service-oriented architecture;software development process	Ralf Klischewski;Eman Askar	2012	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2011.08.001	web service;interoperability;knowledge management;environmental resource management;sociology;law;cross-domain interoperability	Mobile	-75.27748447870427	-3.47938390925234	101308

This study describes the HIE planning process followed by one state. The traditional planning steps recommended by the U.S. federal government did not compel project stakeholders to develop a sustainable business value proposition for the system. Unlike traditional project planning methods, planning a complex, relatively undefined IOS such as a health information exchange may require that IT professionals go beyond traditional planning activities and more actively facilitate definition of possible system value. In addition, the results show that technology should be considered earlier in the planning process, underscoring the need to anticipate the impact of IT architecture on the resulting system capabilities and value.	information exchange;organizational behavior;undefined behavior	Dana Edberg;Lynn O'Mara;Jeanne Wendel	2014	2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2014.348	public relations;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;hrhis;electronic data interchange;database;management;world wide web	AI	-75.24420663618945	-3.4535296643378683	101331

In information systems, the notion of stakeholder has been used in many different ways, which, however, tend to reflect a primarily descriptive or instrumental perspective. The paper reviews these approaches and argues for a more thorough understanding of the stakeholder concept as information systems development has become more complex. In particular, the case for a more holistic view of stakeholders in information systems is made, reflecting the current multi-faceted concerns of information systems development. This holistic view, more evident in some recent approaches to the study of information systems stakeholders, is expected to contribute not only in addressing organizational and cultural issues of information systems projects, but also to encourage a more ethical approach to information systems development.	capability maturity model;color gradient;complex systems;faceted classification;holism;information systems research;information system;management information system;mechatronics;programming paradigm;software development process;strategic management;systems theory	Athanasia Pouloudi	1999		10.1109/HICSS.1999.772776	information infrastructure;information technology management;information engineering;information processes and technology;knowledge management;three schema approach;personal information management;management information systems;group information management;management science;information quality;information management;strategic information system;information ethics;stakeholder analysis;information architecture;information system;strategic management	SE	-75.35340044638721	-1.1182511294865054	101368

The process has been adopted piecemeal, using widely different procedures. The information sources relating to such term extension are consequently scattered and poorly organized, compared with conventional patent legal status data. This paper reviews the legal processes behind term extension and provides a survey of the key principles and information sources available.

Within the ICT 2020 research program of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research the Innovation Alliance “Digital Product Memory” (IA DPM) is developing key technologies for the Internet of Things in the cooperative project SEMPROM. Through the use of integrated sensors, relations in the production process become transparent and supply chains as well as environmental influences traceable. The producer is supported and the consumer better informed about the product. 1 Lead Project in the Innovation Alliance “Digital Product Memory” ICT-supported logistics and services related to high-value products, starting from the initial consult and covering everything from maintenance and repair to recycling, has become a key success factor in many sectors. To remain competitive in the global markets, manufacturing and trading companies find they are more and more dependent on the ability to capture and track a product together with all its relevant lifecycle data. As part of the Innovation Alliance “Digital Product Memory” of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the research and industry technology cooperation “SEMPROM—Semantic Product Memory” aimed at the development of the next generation of mobile, embedded, and wireless elements. While the research activities of the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology within the High-Tech Strategy for Germany of the Federal Government focus on the “Internet of Services” by means of the program iD2010 (see Heuser and Wahlster 2011, and, for example, the THESEUS research program1), the SEMPROM project addresses fundamental challenges in building the complementary 1www.theseus-programm.de.

Internet has consequently become the natural environment for these organizations. This evolution has put a bigger pressure in Law Enforcement Agencies LEAs demanding more efforts and resources in the fight against transnational organized crime. LEAs can therefore profit from international cooperation in fighting these organizations. However, differences among legal frameworks, languages and police and judicial culture may create interoperability issues. The CAPER project addressed the prevention of transnational organized crime by trying to provide the needed interoperability among the different European LEAs. In this work, we introduce a supranational Organized Crime Structure OCS modelled through an ontology in order to improve European LEAs Interoperability ELIO. Results suggest that ELIO is able to provide the required interoperability features, overcoming the issues that arise in this scenario.	interoperability;ontology (information science)	Jorge González-Conejero;Rebeca Varela Figueroa;Juan Munoz-Gomez;Emma Teodoro	2013		10.1007/978-3-662-45960-7_16	public relations;business;computer security	Vision	-73.21767832968986	-0.12704449535480158	101995

The interaction of knowledge workers with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has presented a particularly interesting dynamic to researchers who study changes in related behavioural phenomena. One such phenomenon is self-monitoring. This paper examines the economics of self-monitoring and the integral role of ICTs in enabling knowledge workers to self-monitor. By merging Foucault's power/knowledge ideas with classical agency theory, we gain a richer understanding of human capital dynamics in a knowledge economy.	glan–foucault prism	Nilmini Wickramasinghe;Roberta Lamb	2009	IJNVO	10.1504/IJNVO.2009.023805	information and communications technology;social science;economics;knowledge economy;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;knowledge engineering;power;sociology;personal knowledge management;self-monitoring;knowledge value chain;management;law;information technology	Theory	-74.47271102110327	-1.4889533252656075	102259

Its rapid expansion since the mid-1990s has drawn attention to the impact it will have on promoting trade, economic growth and development. In addition to the many benefits associated with e-commerce, concern has been rising in regards to the widening technological gap, 'the digital divide' among countries and sectors within countries. Electronic commerce and the Internet are posed to stimulate trade by lowering the cost of gathering and processing information from distant markets, by creating global access to specific goods and services and by making it possible to send over the Internet goods and services that traditionally required physical delivery. Electronic commerce is expected to directly and indirectly create and destroy jobs. New jobs will be generated in the information and communication technologies sector, while the indirect creation of jobs will occur via increased demand and productivity. At the same time, some reallocation and destruction of jobs are expected as a consequence of changes in the way of doing business. The net effect on employment will be the resultant of a complex set of interactions and will by no means be uniform across countries, geographic areas, industries or skill groups. This paper will review the issues relevant to the impact of e-commerce on international trade and employment. Any discussion on these issues is necessarily tentative since evidence of the impact of electronic commerce on economic and social processes is only beginning to accumulate. The paper is organized as follows: Section I, provides an overview of electronic commerce and its economy-wide effects. Section II, includes some indicators that shed light on the growth e-commerce and the overall state of e-readiness in the region. Section III, highlights the relevant issues dealing with the impact of e-commerce on trade and employment. Section IV, presents concluding remarks. 3 I. As electronic-commerce (e-commerce) grows and further exploits the attributes of the Internet, it will likely have significant effects on national economies and industry structure. E-commerce has come to take on two important roles; first as a more effective and efficient conduit and aggregator of information, and second, as a potential mechanism for the replacement of many economic activities once performed within a business enterprise by those that can be done by outside suppliers that compete with each other to execute these activities. In response to this increased level of outsourcing opportunities, businesses will exploit the benefits of …	e-commerce payment system;interaction;internet;job stream;outsourcing;resultant	Paul Foley;David Sutton	1998		10.1109/HICSS.1998.655277	the internet;computer science;marketing;electronic trading;internet presence management;advertising;data analysis;business communication;information good;world wide web;demand;information system;commerce	Web+IR	-76.51763727992213	2.2718947709430366	102417

We propose that tax software use and electronic filing (e-filing) offer a novel and interesting research setting that is relevant to E-Government and security because of (1) the use of software to complete tax returns by a large portion of the citizenry, (2) the necessity of security for transmittal of information during e-filing, (3) the privacy of the subject matter, (4) the current promotion of e-filing by the American tax collection agency (IRS), and (5) individual taxpayer ambivalence or negative attitude toward taxes and the government in general. We suggest that when the information system serves as surrogate for a tax domain expert several antecedents to security and privacy trust are potential determinants of use.	biological anthropology;e-government;information system;privacy;subject matter expert turing test;subject-matter expert	Alexander J.

Does this phenomenon exist in tourism development? In this paper, based on the provincial level data, it is studied whether regional tourism development depends on the abundance of tourism resources or other constraints. The results show that tourism resource is only one of the factors affecting tourism development level, and the phenomenon of “curse of resource” and spatial differences in characteristics of tourism are mainly caused by major investment in the tertiary industry and attractions density. To this end, in areas with rich tourism resources and relatively low tourism revenue, it should be focused on developing resource potential and integration of tourism resources, as well as improving the concentration of resources, in order to promote the development of the tourism industry; furthermore, in areas with relative scarcity of tourism resources, the lack of resources can be compensated thorough improving economic development level and regional accessibility degree, strengthening infrastructure construction, as well as improving the level of tourism services.	accessibility	Junni Wang;Suocheng Dong;Yongkun Wan	2014	2014 22nd International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2014.6950835	tourism geography;environmental economics;environmental resource management;ecotourism;business;economic growth	Robotics	-76.83001002149453	-7.072947718311147	102932

The driver discussion traditionally separates Malthusian (technology driven) from Boserupian (population driven) theories. I present a numerical model of the transition to agriculture and discuss this model in the light of the population versus technology debate and in Boserup’s analytical framework in development theory. Although my model is based on ecological—Neomalthusian— principles, the coevolutionary positive feedback relationship between technology and population results in apparent Boserupian behaviour: innovation is greatest when population pressure is highest. This outcome is not only visible in the theory-driven reduced model, but is also present in a corresponding “real world” simulator which was tested against archaeological data, and which thus demonstrates the relevance and validity of the coevolutionary model. The lesson to be learned is that not all that acts Boserupian needs Boserup at its core. 1 Transitions to agriculture The relationship between humans and their environment underwent a radical change during the last 10000 years: from mobile and small groups of foraging people to sedentary extensive cultivators and on to high-density intensive agriculture modern society turned the formerly predominantly passive human user of the environment into an active component of the Earth system. The most striking global impact is only visible and measurable during the last 150 years (Crutzen and Stoermer, 2000; Crutzen, 2002); much earlier, however, the use of forest resources for metal smelting from early Roman times and the medieval extensive agricultural system had already changed the landscape (Barker, 2011; Kaplan et al., 2009); the global effects of these early extensive cultivation and harvesting practices are yet under debate (Ruddiman, 2003; Lemmen, 2009; Kaplan et al., 2011; Stocker et al., 2011). ∗Chapter manuscript submitted to “Society, Nature and History: The Legacy of Ester Boserup” 15th August 2011 1 ar X iv :1 10 8. 25 85 v1 [ qbi o. PE ] 1 2 A ug 2 01 1 Transitions to agriculture occurred in almost every region of the world, earliest in China and the Near East over 9000 years ago (Kuijt and Goring-Morris, 2002; Londo et al., 2006), and latest in Australia and Oceania with the arrival of Polynesian and European immigrants few hundred years ago (Diamond and Bellwood, 2003). While each local transition can be considered revolutionary, the many diverse mechanisms, environments, and cultural contexts of each agricultural transition make it difficult to speak of the one ‘Neolithic revolution’, as the transition to farming and herding was termed by V. G. Childe almost a century ago (Childe, 1925). The transition from foraging to farming was not only one big step, but may have consisted of many intermediary stages: Bogaard (2005) looks at the transition in terms of the land use systems: she sees first inadvertent cultivation then horticulture then simple and then advanced agriculture, while Boserup (1965) discriminates these stages by the management practice ranging from forest, bush and short fallow to annual and multi cropping. Studies of contemporary hunting-gathering societies showed that much less time has to be devoted to procuring food (Sahlins, 1972) than with agriculture, and that much less labour is required Boserup (1965) for long fallow systems compared to intensive multi-cropping agriculture. So why farm? While many different answers have been given to this question from archaeology (Barker, 2011), demography (Turchin and Nefedov, 2009) historical economy (Weisdorf , 2005), and ecosystem modeling (Wirtz and Lemmen, 2003), possibly the simplest relationship was proposed by Malthus (1798), who expressed the dynamics between population and food productivity as a reciprocal: more people meant more food production, more production enabled higher populations. Malthus’ reciprocal relationship constitutes a positive feedback loop, which ideally results in ever greater (geometric) growth and productivity increases; that this is not the case in a world with finite resources was expressed by Malthus (1798) by stating that “Population, when unchecked, increases at a geometrical ratio. Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio. A slight acquaintance with numbers will show the immensity of the first power in comparison with the second.”; Malthus identified the need for positive and preventive checks to balance population increase with the limited capacity of resources. How does an increase in productivity come about? First and foremost, the input of more labour increases productivity as stated by Malthus (1798). While he focused on this extensive and inherent productivity increase, the intensification component of productivity increase was highlighted by Boserup (1965). Investments in a more intensive production system would— however—require large additional labour, and the benefits of such investments were often small. To stimulate an investment in more intensive agriculture, Boserup requires population pressure. Both Malthus (1798, 1826) and Boserup (1965, 1981) concentrate on the role of labour (and later division of labour and social/family organisation) and neglect the role of labourindependent innovation; these are not storage or tools (which requires labour for harvesting, building, and tool processing), but rather innovations in the resources themselves, such as cultivation of higher-yielding grains or imported high yield varieties, or their management (such as water rights); this distinction may not unambiguous for some innovations, but is used here for simplification. Labour-independent innovation can be stimulated by diversity in (and thus size of) a population (Darwin, 1859, p. 156): Aggregation is a motor of technological and	darwin;earth system science;ecosystem model;foremost;kaplan–meier estimator;mathematical model;population;positive feedback;production system (computer science);relevance;simulation;text simplification;theory;word lists by frequency	Carsten Lemmen	2011	CoRR		simulation;geography;ecology	AI	-76.36811426848584	-9.841751084031818	103111

A Human Resource Management System (HRMS), refers to the systems and processes at the intersection between human resource management (HRM) and information technology. It merges HRM as a discipline and in particular its basic HR activities and processes with the information technology field, whereas the programming of data processing systems evolved into standardized routines and packages of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software[1]. The main objective of this paper is to reduce the effort of Administrator to keep the daily events such as attendance, projects, works, appointments, etc. This paper deals with the process of identifying the employees, recording their attendance hourly and calculating their effective payable hours or days. This paper should maintain the records of each and every employee and their time spend in to company, which can be used for performance appraisal. Based on that transfer, removal, promotion can be done.

Different pieces of literature report different factors as key to success and generally based on subjective, perceptual data. A synthesis of existing literature is a basis for survey questions. The data was collected from UK based financial sector organisations who are offering their services on electronic channels, using postal questionnaires. The top factors found to be most critical for the success in e-banking are: quick responsive products/services, organisational flexibility, services expansion, systems integration and enhanced customer service. An important lesson from this research is that organisations need to view the e-banking initiative as a business critical area rather that just a technical issue. They need to give attention to internal integration, which may include channels, technology and business process integration, and improving the overall services to their customers.	business process;channel (programming);online banking;postal;system integration	Mahmood Hussain Shah;Ashley Braganza;Vincenzo Morabito	2007	EJIS	10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000693	systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;electrical engineering;management information systems;management science;information technology;information system	HCI	-71.12910204204138	1.627008079994985	103625
29990bbbc1f7a411e4f1e7e5ba3881ed4d87bf00	a paradigm shift for bring your own device (byod)		The present paper aims to understand the effectiveness of the current adoption models in newly-built concept of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and also the role of IT departments in adopting BYOD in organizations. The paper extends the literature on adoption and combines them with the body of work on BYOD. The article compares these two concepts to build a theoretical framework in which BYOD can be examined. The paper presents the lessons learned from four different case studies in Australia, United Kingdom and Denmark. It was found that BYOD requires adaptation as opposed to adoption of technologies. Adaptation is a process in which an employee customises software in a way that allows them to do their task on their own device, at their own place and in their own time. The paper also reports that the adaptation process dictated by BYOD can lead to either innovation or errors and difficulties made by inconsistent use of technologies. The article informs IS researchers that there is a need to study the phenomena of technology adaption further. The research also rises awareness among practitioners on the significant changes that need to be implemented to run BYOD practices.	bring your own device;programming paradigm	Don V.

We then examine and illustrate two fundamental and complementary approaches for investigating multilevel linkages---bottom-up emergent processes and top-down processes. In a brief commentary on each paper in the special issue, we overview the conceptual questions addressed by the research, identify the particular model of multilevel effects that serves as its foundation, and suggest how the use of multilevel models provides insights that help us better understand how innovation phenomena at one level of analysis are linked to those at another, thus providing a richer and more complete perspective on innovation. We conclude by identifying major methodological and applied contributions of the special issue and suggesting future research directions for the study of innovation at and across multiple levels of analysis.

This case study provides a detailed account of an ill-fated initiative to centrally plan and procure, with the aim to homogenize requirements, an integrated applications suite for a number of British higher education institutions. It is argued that because systems are so deeply embedded in operations and organization and, as you cannot possibly foresee and therefore plan for environmental discontinuities, high-risk, 'big-bang' approaches to information systems planning and development must be avoided. In this context the case illustrates the level of complexity that unpredictable change can bring to an information technology project that aims to establish the 'organizationally generic' and the destabilizing effects it has on the network of the project's stakeholders.	bang file;embedded system;information system;procurement;requirement	Teta Stamati;Panagiotis Kanellis;Drakoulis Martakos	2005	J.

Valuing information for this purpose differs significantly from valuing information for accounting purposes. In most cases, the organization is not trying to sell its data to others and has not established a marketplace in which the data's value could be tested. Cost-based valuations (often used to determine a “book” value for intellectual property) also fall short for risk management purposes. Nonetheless, relying on opinion averaging or similar highly subjective techniques rarely results in defensible valuations. This article explores the reasons for valuation in a security risk management context. From these reasons, it is possible to discover effective and defensible techniques of both a quantitative and a qualitative nature.	risk management	Ralph Spencer Poore	2000	Information Systems Security	10.1201/1086/43311.9.4.20000910/31364.4	security management;risk management;computer science;information security;risk management information systems;computer security;intellectual property;information security management	Security	-72.15520106482722	-8.23052823692028	104160

Today is the ability to deal strategically with the knowledge and intelligence, become a success factor for companies that are dependent for their survival, effectively, efficiently and continuously generate innovation. Therefore the company must have deep knowledge about their customers and their needs. It is possible to know better the customer's pursuits, and to deepen the relationship between the customer and the company.Social media is a great way for the companies to communicate with its customers. It has allowed the communication between them like never before as they discuss about products and their likes/dislikes on social media channels.In this Paper we will examine how can social software (e.g. Wikis, Weblogs, Facebook, Xing, Twitter, etc.) as useful tools for knowledge management and what are the opportunities and Challenges with the use of social software for knowledge management in marketing.	emergence;internet;knowledge management;knowledge society;social media;software bug;web 2.0;wiki	Waad Assaad;Jorge Marx Gómez	2011			software analytics;domain knowledge;social software;software engineering process group;software development;personal knowledge management;knowledge management;social software engineering;systems engineering;data management;engineering	AI	-75.15869317676504	3.658107904426029	104706

Due to the advancement of technology, faster innovation, growing competition and more demanding consumers, managing a brand is becoming more and more complex. Entrepreneurs in Startups and SMEs need to have a clear branding strategy: a narrative that defines the company’s vision, inspires employees and others, and remains relevant through changes. This is hard since the branding concept has been researched from many different perspectives, which makes it foggy. This paper aims to present an ontology that uncovers the key concepts of startup and SME brand identity, in order not only to bring some semantical clarity to the topic but also to lay the foundation for the development of a co-design tool to collaboratively inquire on brand identity in startups and SMEs.	design tool;identity provider	Dina Elikan;Yves Pigneur	2018			knowledge management;ontology;computer science	AI	-74.9561939644192	-2.4066556002843913	105015

This study assumes that the use of ICT in the manufacturing sector is increasing from year to year in the form of a geometric progression due to the rapid innovations of ICT around the globe. Labour input was subdivided into skilled semi-skilled and unskilled, to measure the achievement of the knowledge-based economy (K-economy) through human capital involved in the sector. The results of this study show that the contribution of the ICT used in the sector was the highest one among the input terms. This means that achieving K-economy through ICT is faster than achieving it through the human capital and other traditional inputs. The impact of ICT on TFP contributions is significant and better than skilled labour as an indicator of knowledge workers (human capital) that showed a very low contribution of TFP. But the growth rate of TFP is lower compared with the growth rate of the ICT. As a result, the achievement of the K-economy is not in a geometric progression like that of the ICT development.	knowledge-based systems	Elsadig Musa Ahmed	2006	JIKM	10.1142/S0219649206001372	information and communications technology;economics;international trade;economic growth;labour economics	AI	-75.12885662660884	2.2269437365055564	105666

Moreover, it is expected that flood risk will continue to rise due to the combined effect of increasing numbers of people and economic assets in risk-prone areas and the effects of climate change. In order to mitigate the impact of natural hazards on European economies and societies, improved risk assessment, and management needs to be pursued. With the recent transition to a more risk-based approach in European flood management policy, flood analysis models have become an important part of flood risk management (FRM). In this context, free and open-source (FOSS) geospatial models provide better and more complete information to stakeholders regarding their compliance with the Flood Directive (2007/60/EC) for effective and collaborative FRM. A geospatial model is an essential tool to address the European challenge for comprehensive and sustainable FRM because it allows for the use of integrated social and economic quantitative risk outcomes in a spatio-temporal domain. Moreover, a FOSS model can support governance processes using an interactive, transparent and collaborative approach, providing a meaningful experience OPEN ACCESS ISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 2705 that both promotes learning and generates knowledge through a process of guided discovery regarding flood risk management. This article aims to organize the available knowledge and characteristics of the methods available to give operational recommendations and principles that can support authorities, local entities, and the stakeholders involved in decision-making with regard to flood risk management in their compliance with the Floods Directive (2007/60/EC).	data quality;database;decision support system;directive (programming);emoticon;entity;geographic information system;it risk management;interrupt;loss function;norm (social);open-source software;requirement;risk assessment;software documentation;transparency (graphic)	Raffaele Albano;Leonardo Mancusi;Aurelia Sole;Jan Adamowski	2015	ISPRS Int.

Data.gov.uk will turn five in January 2015. According to datacatalogs.org, there are more than 380 Open Data portals around the world, with new portals still appearing all the time. Some Open Data practitioners cried 'go ugly, go early', others 'raw data now', while others lobbied for CSV and RDF. With Open Data initiatives maturing, what can countries such as Ireland, who are embarking on their national Open Data journey, learn from the experience of these instigators? What are best practices for selecting datasets, publishing data and supporting data reuse? In this paper, I present the experience of defining an Irish Open Data strategy, based on an ecosystem structure incorporating not only technical, but social, political, economic and legislative aspects. Each element of the ecosystem represents a key component of a sustainable Open Data initiative. Through an extensive literature review of international best practice and liaising with stakeholders, the ecosystem elements evolved, along with common principles and challenges. Finally, the outcome of this study is a concrete roadmap to progress the vision of Open Data in Ireland.	best practice;ecosystem;experience;google summer of code;handbook;interaction;portals;resource description framework	Deirdre Lee	2014		10.1145/2691195.2691258	engineering;knowledge management;environmental resource management;management science	DB	-74.48318452054333	-5.12763786094552	106326

7db3a8010d0c32e4bdbb564fab1d1200a7cee45a	data spaces: combining goal-driven and data-driven approaches in community decision and negotiation support		In the last decade, social network analytics and related data analysis methodologies have helped big players gain enormous influence on the web, largely due to clever centralistic data collection in major data lakes. In the form of recommender systems, this can also be seen as world-scale group decision support. In our research, we have been more interested in how these kinds of technologies can spill over to smaller-scale communities of interest in the long tail of the internet. Examples include learning communities and open source software development communities of individuals, but also questions of controlled data and knowledge sharing among small and medium enterprises or medical institutions. Especially in the latter cases, we often face strongly conflicting goals that need to be negotiated to mutually acceptable solutions, quite along the original GDSS and NSS visions of Mel Shakun and colleagues. One example is medical research support on rare diseases which raises the need for data sharing across multiple health organizations (not necessarily being fond of each other) in a fully transparent, fraud-resistant research process while preserving best-possible privacy of patient data. We end with a summary of the Industrial Data Space initiative recently proposed by Fraunhofer which aims at architectures, rules and tools for data sovereignty in cross-organizational data management and analytics.	dataspaces;spaces	Matthias Jarke	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-63546-0_1	data collection;management science;decision support system;data-driven;data exchange;data sharing;knowledge sharing;data management;knowledge management;business;analytics	HCI	-65.48848383112772	-5.39582070927078	107345

It gives an overview of the characteristics of the open data and the current state of a recently started implementation of an open data initiative in Croatia. Since the process involves a series of actions, the following questions need to be answered: what are the effects of an open data initiative and how could these effects be valued? As a starting point in answering these questions we provide an overview of current research initiatives on how to value effects of open government data. Approaches to open data research are usually classified into three broad groups: open data readiness assessments; open data implementation studies; and impact studies. We also bring an overview of the evaluation frameworks already in place in countries where open data initiatives are on the top of the political and social agenda. As a result, in this paper we propose actions in the areas of law and policy, as well as in the areas of organization and technology, which could benefit Croatia's economic growth and democratic empowerment, as suggested by open data advocates.

Enterprise portals (EPs) are seen as the antidote to these problems by becoming more and more the ultimate knowledge management (KM) tool. The current hype about EPs is focused on their application as KM tools. Very little attention is given to other aspects of KM, namely the organisational, human and cultural aspects. The article will provide an overview of the technical and strategic relationship between EPs and KM and illustrate that EPs are only the technology component and should not be mistaken for the essence of KM. What is needed for successful KM in an organisation is not technology alone, but also a knowledge‐sharing culture, knowledge‐sharing policies, organisational processes, performance measurement and business strategies.	knowledge management	Marian Cloete;Retha Snyman	2003	Aslib Proceedings	10.1108/00012530310486593	sociology of culture;information age;computer science;operations management;information overload;comparative research;change management;sociology;management;operations research	HPC	-72.02178804312928	2.382802292438238	108057

618c77df3ecc7e34e238ec06f67fbcb747e4aeea	the quality attribution in data, information and knowledge		The literature on quality of data, information and knowledge has a tendency to focus on the measurement aspects of such constructs. This implies some emphasis on scale construction. Unfortunately, conceptual clarity is in too many cases not apparent. This chapter advocates for the application of Social Cognitive Theory as a robust theoretical framework in order to understand the quality attributions of data, information and knowledge constructs. The definitions of data, information and knowledge are presented in a hierarchical structure having the data definition as a first order construct, the information definition as a second order construct built upon the data construct, and the knowledge construct as a third order construct built upon the information construct. Furthermore, the definitions of these constructs require considering the unit of analysis individual versus organization. Data has a common definition for both units of analysis. However information and knowledge have different definitions depending on the unit of analysis. Finally, this chapter addresses the quality attribution in the five considered constructs. In line with the current dominant paradigm, quality it is not an absolute assessment as it depends on the considered context and situation.		Raul M.

However, the scientific foundation (knowledge elicitation methodology) and the commercial growth of knowledge management (KM) have largely developed in parallel. So, the creation of human-centered systems faces lingering challenges. In the KM process, company management establishes a program whereby experts who possess valuable knowledge collaborate with a knowledge engineer. Working together, they elicit the expert's wisdom for inclusion in the organization's knowledge base.	emergence;knowledge base;knowledge engineer;knowledge management;knowledge-based systems	Robert R.

In this article, we underscore the importance of timing and start by focusing on the effect of pre-existing standards and regulations on the subsequent development and diffusion of product innovations. The effect is assessed in terms of the time interval between the invention of a technological principle and the introduction of the first marketable product (development phase), and the successive time interval up to the start of large-scale industrial production and diffusion (adaptation phase). The authors analyse fifty heterogeneous cases studies of radically new high-tech product innovations from the year 1850 onward. The results indicate that pre-existing standards and regulations significantly shorten the adaptation phase of innovations, an effect not found for the development phase. The shortening effect on the adaptation phase is particularly evident for radically new innovations and innovations that are an integral part of larger technological systems. As the adaptation phase is often a timeand capital-intensive phase for industry, this accelerating effect on the diffusion of innovations is highly relevant for innovation managers and policy makers.

As an innovative contribution, this paper proposes a collective intelligence (CI) approach for improving the free software adoption by small and medium-sized municipalities. To build this CI-approach, the authors have analyzed the dynamic of the communities hosted by Brazilian Public Software (BPS) Portal and the actions related to implementation of software solution in Brazilian municipalities. They started by identifying key variables and their relationship, and mining data from the communities whose software solutions have been successfully implemented in the municipalities according to player reports available in BPS portal.

Based on reports and statistical analysis, the authors could understand both the dynamic of the successful communities and the adoption phenomena by municipalities as a consequence of individual initiatives. The results indicate that a CI-approach based on 5W1H can improve the knowledge sharing and promote the best practice in the free software adoption by small and medium-sized municipalities.	best practice;collective intelligence	Jarbas Lopes Cardoso;Ivanir Costa;Frédéric Andrès;Silvio Ernesto Barbin	2015		10.1145/2857218.2857264	public good;five ws;knowledge management;data mining;database;management;world wide web;computer security;social network	SE	-76.39915890258256	3.2176399496218338	108566

It finds that the Hong Kong government has made considerable progress in developing online service delivery, notably for the business sector, but that wider governance changes are limited. The article holds that to succeed in addressing the challenges of the information age, the Hong Kong government needs to adopt a broader strategy that goes beyond service delivery to encompass citizen engagement and participation.	e-governance;e-government;itil;online service provider	Ian Holliday;Rebecca C.

Quantitative and qualitative content analyses were used to survey the way that companies present and value information and knowledge, based on the annual reports of the FTSE 100, the United Kingdom's largest publicly-listed companies. A novel content analysis approach is used, based on a set of categories proposed by Oppenheim, Stenson and Wilson. Many of the companies analysed made explicit the importance of information and knowledge, through either discussion in the text of the annual report or through an attempt to assign a monetary value to information assets. Where the importance of information and knowledge was not made explicit, the study revealed links between successful performance and effective use of information assets. Different categories of information assets were identified within the annual reports. Conclusions drawn from the analysis include that information and knowledge are demonstrably important to FTSE 100 companies, although the specific term “knowledge” does not appear to have a special significance in the companies’ lexicon; and that certain sectors, such as General Financial, General Retail, Travel & Leisure, Mining, Aerospace & Defence and Software & Computer Services, mention information and knowledge more than others.	fundamental theorem of software engineering;lexicon;outsourcing	Joanna Cummins;David Bawden	2010	J.

We have observed and recorded three business process modeling projects in different companies. We report on the findings resulting from the analysis of the first project. We find evidence that certain traits related to high-quality abstraction formation contribute to more structured modeling performance. Through our analysis we gain more insight in the cognitive mechanisms involved in modeling, which provides us with another step towards design of effective modeling support.	abstraction (software engineering);business process;codebook;enterprise engineering;high- and low-level;holism;process modeling;reflection (computer graphics);secondary consciousness;world wide web	Ilona Wilmont;Erik Barendsen;Stijn Hoppenbrouwers	2012			simulation;computer science;knowledge management;operations management	SE	-68.46754126256482	3.619354896203116	109668

Using agency theory, this paper concentrates on using information technology to monitor the investment committed to these relationships. Agency value (rather than agency cost) is proposed as the appropriate criterion for this monitoring. A taxonomy of monitoring effects on agency relationship is proposed and the benefits of pursuing each of the possible policies in electronic commerce are studied.	e-commerce;outsourcing;taxonomy (general)	David C.

Traditional vocational training and education offerings are no longer sufficient in this situation and have to be supplemented with short-term, need-oriented and work-process oriented offers. In mecomp.net all actors in the field of media and IT-competence have been considered as community of interest, self-regulating the evolution of qualification offers based on current developments in the market and employment situation. Interaction, communication and self-regulation within this community is supported by an Internet-based Web-Portal, providing evolution mechanisms and matchmaking between suppliers and seekers of jobs and qualification measures. This paper introduces the basic organizational and sociological aspects of mecomp.net, outlines the main concepts of the Web-Portal (wwwmecomp.net) and implementation, and summarizes the lessons learned.	requirement;world wide web	Andreas Billig;Lutz Nentwig;Johannes Werner Erdmann;Kurt Sandkuhl	2003	Eleventh Euromicro Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing, 2003.

The result is a fragmented ®eld that is itself arti®cially split from the related literature on organizational learning. KM may be progressing through a predictable life-cycle that could end in collapse of the KM concept unless researchers can develop more integrative core theories of learningand knowledge-related phenomena in organizations. The diverse body of organizational learning and knowledge management research provides an impressive foundation for the synthesis of such broader theories of learning and knowledge that are creative, new, and integrative.	fork (software development);fragmented object;knowledge management;theory	Peter H.

a38ef9110199688cf72f586a119b4b81fb868da0	towards a proposal for the sustainability through institutions in public transport services in times of emergency		The public transport service system provides safe and secure urban mobility for all citizens. This paper describes work-in-progress regarding its role in times of emergency, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, or terrorist attacks. In order to deliver good and safe transport service, it requires adequate resources such as information, staff, property, vehicle, infrastructure, the set of operational rules, and governance. In this perspective, establishing a sustainable and smart transport model to cope with transport services’ disruptions especially for emergency events is vital. A general characterization of critical actions for public transport Emergency Management Planning is provided. A new perspective on designing sustainable public transport services in times of emergency is introduced in order to support transport service company’s operational activities based on sustainable institutions principles.

3ee5ee0a18ece7dd8baff109dbd6fc9aedd9fa52	is implementation in the uk health sector	ha33 management science;h social sciences	Since the mid-1980s, the UK public sector has been the subject of wide-ranging reforms involving the introduction of IS and IT. Change has been sought in the ways that services are managed and delivered, the evaluation of the quality of aforesaid services, and in accountability and costing. One of the most predominant of such changes has been the introduction of competition for services, the motivation of which has been to invite efficiency, effectiveness, and related benefits ensuing from the accrual of economies. Pivotal to such change has been an explosion in the introduction of a variety of information systems to meet such challenges. Focusing on health care, a large part of the work of the health service involves collecting and handling information, from lists of people in the population to medical records (including images such as X-ray pictures), to prescriptions, letters, staffing rosters and huge numbers of administrative forms. Yet until recently, the health service has been woefully backward in its use of the technology to handle information by the standards of private industry. This has been quickly changing in recent years and by 2003 the National Health Service (NHS) spent £2.8 billion annually on capital in hospitals (Department of Health, 2003a), around 10% of which was for IT. In the last 20 years, IT has added 2% to overall health expenditure (Wanless, 2001). This investment is still small by the standards of the private sector, but is all the more significant when we consider that health care is an industry which has been slow to adopt IT and one which presents some of the biggest IT opportunities (Department of Health, 2002).	information system	Stuart J.

d33aa406b18f1b556ce3b57e2a4aefc14c6ccd6d	from e-heritage to interpretive archaeology systems (ias): a research framework for evaluating cultural heritage communication in the digital age		The principal purpose of this paper is to examine which research approaches are best suited for determining the requirements of the next generation of interactive interpretation support systems for cultural heritage site. We are optimistic that such systems if properly designed to exploit the potential of advanced information and communication technologies (ICTs), can not only meet, but even exceed visitor-user expectations. The research framework proposed to achieve this ideal integrates insights from both Interpretive Archaeology and interpretive IS research. We call the application of ICT’s in systems for communicating cultural heritage information “e-Heritage Systems or e-HS. We define “Interpretive Archaeology Systems”(IAS) as a subclass of e-HS, the design of which is informed by hermeneutics and phenomenology, Therefore, the principal purpose of the paper is to promote a shift from e-HS to IAS. To illustrate the fruitfulness of our preferred approach for IAS requirements identification, we derive a set of criteria from our research philosophy and apply them to the evaluation of an existing e-HS: the ARCHEOGUIDE in Olympia.	international automated systems;internet authentication service;optimistic concurrency control;requirement	Emmanuel Monod;Heinz K.

A cursory review of this literature reveals conflict in the understanding of GTM, with a variety of grounded theory approaches apparent. The purpose of this investigation was to establish what alternative grounded theory approaches have been employed in IS, and to what extent each has been used. In order to accomplish this goal, a comprehensive set of IS articles that claimed to have followed a grounded theory approach were reviewed. The articles chosen were those published in the widely acknowledged top eight IS-centric journals, since these journals most closely represent exemplar IS research. Articles for the period 1985-2008 were examined. The analysis revealed four main grounded theory approaches in use, namely (1) the classic grounded theory approach, (2) the evolved grounded theory approach, (3) the use of the grounded theory approach as part of a mixed methodology, and (4) the application of grounded theory techniques, typically for data analysis purposes. The latter has been the most common approach in IS research. The classic approach was the least often employed, with many studies opting for an evolved or mixed method approach. These and other findings are discussed and implications drawn.

This poster presents the results of a survey of the Ligue des Bibliotheques Europeennes de Recherche-Association of European Research Libraries (LIBER) academic member library directors to find out what types of RDS their libraries are currently offering and what services they plan to offer in the future. The survey found that while most of these libraries currently offer or are planning to offer at least some RDS, consultative or reference-type services are offered more often than are technical or hands-on services. Most of these libraries are in discussions regarding data policies, collaborate with other organizations within or outside their own institutions to offer RDS, and most provide support for RDS skills development for staff members. This poster discusses the implications of these findings and offers directions for future research.	american libraries;library (computing)	Carol Tenopir;Danielle Pollock;Suzie Allard;Dane Hughes	2016		10.1002/pra2.2016.14505301129	library science;public relations;engineering;management	DB	-66.98895161900467	-6.1649817146365	111591

Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the capability of finance and technology, and can not afford to establish a collaborative portal for partners. With social network service increasing rapidly and being used popularly, an enterprise social collaboration platform and system architecture are proposed for improving the communication and cooperation of SMEs. Synchronization method of product catalogue which is extracted from ERP or PDM is described to share product information among partners. Social project collaboration based on social networking is analyzed, and function of social project management is designed.

Despite the benefits of electronic system, good quality may not be totally achieved unless its risks to security are mitigated. Working in collaboration with a 150 bed private hospital in Turkey; this study aims to present a secure healthcare network infrastructure while presenting the security vulnerabilities in the current hospital information systems. The regulation criteria in Turkey and counterparts in USA and EU are compared according to their privacy approach and a list of items for common security controls from different industries is proposed as a best practice. The study shows that the hospital is not compliant with known healthcare standards like HIPAA or ISO 80001. Management's attitude against privacy and security shows that the responsibility is totally to IT and Biomedical Engineering Departments. As hospitals are adopting electronic transactions, consideration must be given to protect public electronic health records in terms of personal privacy aspects. Healthcare industry in Turkey should benefit from best practices in other industries and applications in other countries. This study can lead the pathway for policy makers in healthcare organizations and regulation authorities to implement a more secure environment for every citizen.	best practice;compliance behavior;electronic health records;electronic funds transfer;european union;gene regulatory network;health insurance portability and accountability act;hospital information systems;hospitals, private;information sciences;information system;internet;isoproterenol;medical information systems;network security;privacy;secure environment;security controls;vulnerability (computing);benefit;standards characteristics	Nihan Namoglu;Yekta Ülgen	2013	2014 18th National Biomedical Engineering Meeting	10.3233/978-1-61499-276-9-126	standard of good practice;personally identifiable information;public relations;cloud computing security;information privacy;environmental resource management;information security;security service;business;computer security;information security management	Security	-70.91527210138341	-8.656531684765653	111944

The next generation of geospatial information infrastructures is proposed as a possible solution. Still, questions such as ‘what does all this mean to environmental information systems’ and ‘what is expected to change’, have only partially been answered. In this paper, we describe the recent challenges for eEnvironment services in Europe, specify desired capabilities and derive according requirements. We identify affected stakeholder communities and depict their involvement in the overall value chain of environmental knowledge generation. Specific examples illustrate individual needs, while a derived description of the value chain indicates more general outcomes. Developmental requirements of future information systems are discussed. The presented work answers the questions above by bridging the gab between stakeholder needs, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) development and higher level concepts, such as Digital Earth and Future Internet.	bridging (networking);future internet;gab;information systems;information system;lively kernel;microsoft outlook for mac;otto h. schade;requirement;sven jaschan;terrestrial television	Sven Schade;Barbara Fogarty;Michael Kobernus;Katharina Schleidt;Paul Gaughan;Paolo Mazzetti;Arne-Jørgen Berre	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22285-6_16	computer science;engineering;knowledge management;operations management;software engineering;management science;management	AI	-68.37742144449298	-0.8204284396170356	112203

The governmental departments (including finance, taxation, business and other institutions), listed companies, famous software companies, academic institutions and other professions are paying more and more attention to the research in the finance information field by using XBRL. Related projects, academic conferences and discussion have been initiated to study its application and benefit. This has, in turn, lead to a new research applications upsurge in the field of accounting information management. However, the phenomenon that the advantages of XBRL were magnified is also apparent. In order to spread and apply XBRL, it is vital to objectively understand its advantages and limitations of XBRL, to constantly explore its applicable areas, and to have a good working knowledge of how it can be further developed. Being a business reporting language with many advantages, XBRL is not 100% perfect. There is still a huge distance between XBRL and the ideal network business reporting language. Based on system analysis on the research of XBRL in China and the research data samples selected from the Listed Companies in China Shanghai Stock Exchange from 2005 to 2006, the test demonstrated that the present enterprise does not obtain the superior earnings from the XBRL application, thus those enterprises cannot become the prime promoter of XBRL application. Currently, the shortcomings and performance bottlenecks in XBRL application are: Firstly, XBRL can only solve the problem in data performance format, but cannot fix the problem for the main reason for the existence of a multi-report form system and in the disclosure of information. Secondly, as there are many different systems and bodies of Taxonomy, the use of XBRL to compare and analyze accounting information in cross-regional or crosscountry is not meaningful. Even in the same country, a number of organizations based on different Taxonomy will face the same problem when comparing financial and accounting information. Finally, there are inherent flaws of XBRL, such as large data storage capacity demand, inefficient implementation and excessive reliance on network security. It is bound to put enormous additional construction IT costs to companies, and may lead to ‘IT investment black hole’. Based on the research above, this paper proposes some methods and direction to solve or alleviate the problems this study found and questioned. In the research developing process of XBRL, if the problem questioned in this paper can obtain effective solutions, we can believe that this technology will bring significant changes to the accounting profession. XBRL will become the promotional power of convergence of international accounting standards. Finally, not only will it make the enterprises’ accounting information reporting mechanized, standardized and transparent, but it will also reduce the risk of fraud in accounting to a certain extent.	apply;computer data storage;evolutionary taxonomy;information management;information processing;network security;software industry;system analysis	Hongming Chen;Wenchuan Sun	2011	JSW		database;computer security	DB	-71.61332773638652	-6.0627404698694205	112470

a5de09243b4b12fc4bcf4db56c8e38fc3beddf4f	governance of an enterprise social intranet implementation: the statkraft case		Recent studies demonstrate that the implementation of enterprise social systems (ESSs) will transfer organizations into new paradigm of social business which results in enormous economic returns and competitive advantage. Social business creates a completely new way of working and organizing characterised by social collaboration, intrinsic knowledge sharing, voluntarily mass participation, just name a few. Thus, implementation of ESSs should tackle the uniqueness of the new way of working and organizing. However, there is a shortage of knowledge about implementation of these large enterprise systems. The purpose of this paper is to study governance model of ESSs implementation. A case study is conducted to investigate the implementation of the social intranet called the ‘Stream’ at Statkraft, which is a world-leading energy company in Norway. The governance model of ‘Stream’ emphasizes the close cooperation and accountability between corporate communication, human resources and IT, which implies paradigm shift in governance of implementing ESSs. Benefits and challenges in the implementation are also identified. Based on the knowledge and insights gained in the study, recommendations are proposed to assist the company in improving governance of ESSs implementation. The study contributes knowledge/know-how on governance of ESSs implementation.	enterprise system;intranet;organizing (structure);programming paradigm;social collaboration;social system	Shengnan Han;Sofia Sörås;Ole Schjødt-Osmo	2015			marketing;accountability;competitive advantage;intranet;knowledge management;enterprise system;computer science;corporate communication;knowledge sharing;social collaboration;corporate governance	Web+IR	-76.96753038788938	3.0894231432864356	113380

This paper seeks to extend our understanding by developing a model relating technology to strategy. The model is a two-by-two frame based on the distinction between ‘planned’ v ‘emergent’ strategy and ‘latent’ v ‘sensible’ technology. The frame generates four distinct domains which we label ‘development’, ‘capitalisation’, ‘creation’ and ‘cultivation’. The paper then considers the ‘creation’ quadrant through a case history of the stent industry. This case indicates that (a) new technologies lack the ‘revolutionary’ characteristic with which they are normally associated; (b) that the courthouse rather than the marketplace is an important if not primary domain where new technology firms compete; and (c) that new technology firms are much more aggressive when interacting with other new technology firms than they are with firms from the existing industry.	emoticon;interaction;pervasive informatics	Jim Lawlor;Donncha Kavanagh	2009	Techn.

This paper describes the challenges ahead in creating new communication networks to support postdisaster operations, and sets them in the context of the current issues in protection of critical infrastructures. The analysis reveals that while there are some common concerns there are also fundamental differences. The paper serves as an overview of some promising research directions and pointers to existing works in these areas.	hoc (programming language);instability;mathematical optimization;pointer (computer programming);spontaneous order;stationary process;synthetic intelligence;telecommunications network	Mikael Asplund;Simin Nadjm-Tehrani;Johan Sigholm	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-03552-4_23	information infrastructure;engineering ethics;computer science;engineering;critical infrastructure;management science;operations research;computer security;technology	HCI	-73.86130024699727	-8.945773209461132	114093

Despite the fact that the academic community has already exploited many of them, there is an evident reluctance from the business community to act likewise. Recent analysis reveals that the problem lies in overcoming certain business barriers rather than technological ones. At this stage understanding the real-life economic issues from a business perspective is deemed as more important than gaining understanding of complex theoretical economical problems, such as those related to accounting or resource sharing mechanisms especially in cases where the players do not exhibit the required technological expertise. This paper is stimulated from interaction with players from the industry and aims to fill this gap. In particular, we identify and evaluate a number of economic issues that should be taken into consideration by industrial players so that their trust and confidence in the adoption of this promising technology be increased.	real life	George A.

Therefore we developed a prototype scheme in 2016. In this article we present the first results of applying this scheme and classifying five projects. Within this application we tested for intercoder reliability and for potential weaknesses of the scheme. While the reliability of the proposed scheme is generally good for categories with discrete values, qualitative categories result in highly differing coding.

Through a series of clearly stated assumptions about the scale of library demand as opposed to the size of the RFID market, plus some simple calculations, he shows that prices for the kinds and numbers of tags that libraries want to purchase will not decrease very much, if at all. The looked-for savings in installing RFID will come in lower-priced software and hardware, not in tag prices.	radio-frequency identification	Eric Ipsen	2005	Public Library Quarterly	10.1300/J118v24n01_07	identification;document processing;stock management;library;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;information security;advertising;world wide web;radio frequency;cost estimate	HCI	-68.9129845992987	-9.711222269272577	115140

Convenient access to the requested content is creating a competitive advantage for different types of decisions. Today, when we are inundated with large volumes of information it is essential to use technological solutions that enable flexible storage, retrieval, processing and interpreting information. One of approach, which is communicated a few years, but it implementation is hampered by distrust are solutions based on cloud technology. Their potential grow particularly in an environment where individual skills are shared to a large number of users.	distrust;knowledge management	Peter Balco;Martina Drahosová	2016	2016 IEEE 4th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud Workshops (FiCloudW)	10.1109/W-FiCloud.2016.27	computer science;knowledge management;management science;computer security	Visualization	-72.85979563316316	4.10274968892106	115241

The future product is likely to evolve within a fast-growing and socially conscious ecology. Product that works with the way people use their phones will develop in a collaborative social network. Providing social networking will facilitate mobile data network for free, and the ecology of soft-product will allow trust in the mC process. In order that this can be effective, a change in the mC supply-chain model would be require. This paper examines an existing model for charging and billing of mobile soft-product and a Mobile Open Billing Gateway (MOPB) model based on the triangle of B2B and B2C was proposed, with the linkage of trust, and compares a sample range of existing product with possible new mobile product.

63acb9f1ea890ef61f5c28e6e58c11dcc629a561	the early phase of a radiation accident: revisiting thinking on evacuation and exclusion zones		We are just beginning a two year research project on the management of nuclear risk issues, paying particular attention to environmental, financial and safety issues. One aspect that concerns us is to avoid the assumption that any future accident will be similar to a past accident. In the cases of Chernobyl and Fukushima, it was possible both to evacuate the local population to impose a substantial exclusion zone, and we recognize that for many potential accidents this would be the case. But for some nuclear plant, it may not be so because of the large number of local inhabitants or because of some key industrial or societal infrastructure. We would like to take the opportunity of the ISCRAM conference to discuss this issue with a wide audience.	iscram;social infrastructure	Simon D French;Nikolaos Argyris;William J.

In order to conduct this investigation, it was adopted the case study method to deal with the complexity of the aforementioned phenomenon. The organizational structure and the informatization trajectory of the Brazilian Judiciary System, the legal framework for electronic lawsuits, as well as the role of the National Council of Justice (NCJ) on the automation of the Brazilian Judiciary System form the basis for understanding the context. A quantitative analysis of the correlation between IT investment and the efficiency of the courts shows a potential positive influence of IT on reducing the duration and cost of lawsuits, thereby increasing the operational and financial efficiencies of the Brazilian Judiciary System.

We propose barriers exist because of the focus of many academics exclusively within a peer review research network. We explore the case of the Medici Fellowship programme that was implemented in biomedical departments across five universities located in the midlands of England. Our evidence suggests that such fellowship programmes, through the retraining of academics, may have a positive impact on the commercialisation of research. In particular, the fellows, through the enhancement of their social and human capital, are able to act as agents of attitudinal change in their host departments and are seen to build bridges into external business networks that can provide early stage funding, market and legal information and help identify potential customers for nascent academic entrepreneurs.	bridging (networking)	Simon Mosey;Andy Lockett;Paul Westhead	2006	Techn.

Design/methodology/approach – Contemporary methodologies were used for the project design and implementation of the communication and information infrastructure, accompanied with international and domestic good practices related to the development of e-Government. Findings – Based on the strategic recommendations related to ICT policy and standards, and annual operating plans, in the first five-year period (2005-2010) the level of the ICT deployment in the operation of AP Vojvodina Assembly and Government was achieved that is close to the level of e-Government in the developed countries in early 2006. The computer communication network was developed in the buildings of AP Vojvodina Assembly and Government and electronic communication was fully embraced within that network (2007). All activities pertaining to sessions of the Government of AP Vojvodina are conducted electronically, without paper documents (2007), and the electronic voting system was implemented in sessions of the AP Vojvodina Assembly (2009). Several public electronic services were implemented: Library (2006), Portal APV (2007), Records and Archives Office (2010), Legal Regulations and Judicial Practice (2009), Distance Learning (2009) and Access to Records from Sessions of AP Vojvodina Government (2010). Another important result is development of the system aimed at improving IT literacy for all employees in provincial administrative bodies. The results indicate that the creative leadership, careful planning and strict management of implementation plans which are based on precise goals could facilitate a speedy development of e-Government even under severe constraints in financial and technical resources. Originality/value – Recommendations were made for the development of e-Government at the local level, to ensure interoperability with subordinate and superior e-Governments. Recommendations contain models of computer communication networks, software architectures, programme platforms and the strategy for implementation of e-Government.	archive;autonomous robot;e-government;interoperability;recommender system;software architecture;software deployment;telecommunications network	Milan Paroski;Zora Konjovic;Dusan Surla	2013	The Electronic Library	10.1108/02640471311299164	information and communications technology;e-government;strategy;computer science;implementation;law;information technology	HCI	-74.66658865735003	-6.13909169696408	117476

The government-led industrial and technological policies enabled the launch of several national projects building science parks in the nation, while most science parks in Western industrialised nations have been built with the initiative of the private sector. This paper focuses on the implementation of government policies regarding science and technology policies as well as the regional innovation system in Japan. It argues how the nation approaches and carries out its science and technology policies in order to create its national and local innovation systems that eventually increase its national and local competitiveness.	competitive analysis (online algorithm);industrial robot	Sang-Chul Park	2001	AI & SOCIETY	10.1007/BF01208708	public policy;industrial policy;law;policy studies;private sector	Logic	-75.12284702259056	-8.921902299166101	117494

Although just collecting, processing and retrieving of data were significant in the past, the subject of information security is turned into a serious challenge in micro and macro levels of organizational management. Indeed, observance of the information security principals is counted as a critical infrastructure in today’s knowledge based organizations. In order to realize this purpose, we need to make a strategic plan for IT security. However, we cannot expect to design a comprehensive plan, if we don’t have accurate statistics about the level of the information security maturity in current organizations.	capability maturity model;information security	Abbas Toloie Eshlaghy;Alireza Pourebrahimi;Babak Zendehdel Nobari	2011	Computer and Information Science		information security audit;computer security model;standard of good practice;itil security management;security convergence;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;information security;information security standards;data mining;management science;service integration maturity model;computer security;enterprise information security architecture;information security management	Security	-71.19539906679701	2.9500334901950724	117641

Through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of existing studies published in the top five information systems journals, our research offers a systematic exploration of the different CC adoption levels in HEIs and the benefits and challenges in the HigherrnEducation context. Twenty papers were analysed to draw the different views of the CC adoption process to determine its feasibility in the education domain. It was discovered a number of Universities have a keen interest in using CC in their institution owing to the flexible andrncollaborative capabilities of the educational cloud. In conclusion, the SLR identified a clear literaturerngap in this research area. That is, limited empirical studies exploring CC utilisation in HEIs and supporting frameworks that help to promote CC adoption.

ff743c6aa67d688bfa3b0d2ac0f52d12ec71ddaa	does self-regulation provide legal protection and security to e-commerce consumers?		Abstract The development of e-commerce has reformed traditional commerce, subjecting consumers in e-commerce transactions to greater risks, while offering only a weak bargaining position when it comes to their rights. This study analyzes self-regulation as an effective means for providing legal protection and consumer security in e-commerce transactions. Using the normative legal research method, the study shows there is a difference between the United States and the European Union in the application of self-regulation. The United States focuses on a model of self-regulation, while the European Union places more emphasis on the United State’s role through legislation that provides legal protection for e-commerce consumers, and Indonesia has not yet specifically regulated the protection of data privacy or used self-regulation in e-commerce transactions. Self-regulation by business actors is urgent to ensure consumer rights in e-commerce transactions are fulfilled. The findings suggest an effective model for implementing self-regulation marries the existing systems in the United States and the European Union.	e-commerce	Abdul Halim Barkatullah;Djumadi	2018	Electronic Commerce Research and Applications	10.1016/j.elerap.2018.05.008	computer science;e-commerce;law and economics;commerce;consumer bill of rights;normative;legal research;european union;information privacy;legislation	DB	-75.1007788857239	-8.206832686570078	117867

64a5795ec3464f7ab65845bd8625d3bfeb15cbf6	the new data-driven enterprise architecture for e-healthcare: lessons from the indian public sector		Abstract Healthcare delivery is a complex issue and better planning of resources is important. The Indian Government suggested the requirement of developing a healthcare framework for providing easily accessible, affordable healthcare and universal health coverage to all citizens in India. The Health Management Information System (HMIS) at Tamil Nadu was conceptualized in response to this requirement as a case of architectural correction from the manual to a unified healthcare system covering more than 74 million people and 2000 plus healthcare institutions in the state. The system consolidates state-level data in real time, links all health institutions, and makes it possible to track individual health indices. This data is used for planning healthcare, managing drug inventory, and planning health initiatives at the state level. We study the modified enterprise architecture (EA) of Tamil Nadu Health Management Information Systems (TNHMIS) and its comparison to existing EA approaches and operating models. We also discuss the high-level core diagram, the key elements of business processes, IT infrastructure, shared data and customer interfaces and how they are linked. We suggest an EA based approach to managing healthcare.	enterprise architecture	Anjali Kaushik;Aparna Raman	2015	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2014.11.002	knowledge management;environmental resource management;operations management;management	OS	-74.9227932840288	-3.6424116971695653	118413

Conventional point of sale (POS) systems in restaurants was developed to improve the verification and transmission of order information passed from the dining hall to the kitchen. However, POS systems have remained insufficient to share customers’ order information among many staff members in different positions. This paper introduces an information sharing system for full-service restaurants using an advanced POS system with which staff members can share order information in real time. Using this system, kitchen staff members can grasp the total number of orders and the elapsed time for preparation of each order. Moreover, service staff members can grasp the status of each customer quickly. Using this system in a large-scale restaurant, preparation processes can be made more efficient and reduce customer complaints. ences, and social sciences (Kimita et al., 2008, Shimomura et al., 2008, Spohrer & Maglio, 2008, Ueda et al., 2009). For the promotion of service productivity, both streamlining service operations and enhancing values for customers are necessary. Therefore, service engineering focuses on various topics such as optimization of service provision, elucidation of customer satisfaction and value co-creation among stakeholders (Cronin et al., 2000; Moller, Rajala, & Westerlund, 2008; Shimomura, Hara, & Arai, DOI: 10.4018/joci.2010070104 International Journal of Organizational and Collective Intelligence, 1(3), 54-70, July-September 2010 55 Copyright © 2010, IGI Global.

From 2007 for instance, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry started a national project promoting service engineering to improve service sector productivity (Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, 2007). The Japan Productivity Center also established Service Productivity and Innovation for Growth (SPRING) in 2007 (Morikawa, 2008). Restaurant industry is one of the biggest service industries from the viewpoint of workforce in many countries. On the other hand, it has been less scientifically-studied than manufacturing industries because it includes many human factors of employees and customers. Now, the service management of a restaurant is a good research target for service engineering because both streamlining service operations and enhancing values for customers are needed to enhance the service productivity. In Japan, the industrialization of restaurant businesses generally started in the 1970s. Up to that time, restaurant businesses were mainly family run. As the market scale of restaurant businesses increased, some restaurants started to introduce chain store systems. In addition, large restaurants were introduced to increase productivity. Consequently, the market scale of the restaurant industry in Japan increased from approximately 8,000 billion Yen (90 U.S. billion dollars) to 250,000 billion Yen (2.8 trillion U.S. dollars) during the 1970s – 1990s. In the latest report, approximately 737,000 restaurants were operating in Japan in 2006 (Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs, and Communications, 2006). The increase of restaurant markets also brought severe competition among companies. Nowadays, restaurants must improve service operations and to reduce costs. However, provision of services in large restaurants is more difficult than in small restaurants. As chain stores expand, it becomes more difficult to educate staff members to learn high-skill services. In restaurant businesses, information technologies have played important roles in areas such as in inventory control (Ngai et al., 2008), supply chain management (Murphy & Smith, 2009), and knowledge-based management (Muller, 1999). In the 1980s in Japan, restaurant industries introduced point-of-sale (POS) systems that had been originally developed for retail and convenience store (CVS) businesses (Stein, 2005; Trappey & Trappey, 1998) to improve store operations. Different from the usage of POS systems in CVS, restaurants used them for management of customer orders. As a result, POS systems in restaurant businesses added ordering systems. The system obviated the need of servers to go to the kitchen after accepting orders. Moreover, check-out operations were improved because they were calculated automatically for each table. As Jensen (2007) pointed out, smooth check-out is important because it affects customer satisfaction. Although innovative for restaurants, the restaurant POS system had persistent problems. When service staff transmitted order information using a handheld registration device, the information was carried to kitchen staff members on paper for each table, which created the need for the kitchen staff to calculate the number of dishes repeatedly. When kitchen operations were rushed, kitchen staff became unable to remember the elapsed times from receiving an order because the POS did not record the elapsed time of each order. The waiting time for dish is a crucial factor for customer satisfaction and complaints (Mittal et al., 2008). Therefore, we need to pay more attention to the information sharing of customer information among various staffs from the viewpoint of customer satisfactions. Because the conventional POS systems mainly focused on the management of sales information, it was insufficient to grasp the each customer’s situation. This problem is not limited to just restaurants; sharing the customer information is a critical issue in many fields of services such as healthcare services or public services (Han et al., 2006). For instance, in a hospital, various departments are needed to share each patient’s information in real time for the smooth and safe operation (Turcu, Popa, & Ieee, 2009).

This section of population, referred as Base of the Pyramid (BoP) could be served profitably by good enough products and services that are affordable and socially responsible [8]. Prolonged economic recession has forced lower and middle income customers in the West to look for good enough products and services which provide high value for money [5]. The innovation focus is shifting to product, service, process, or system that is affordable, sustainable, good-enough, and rooted in locality. It is often referred as frugal innovation [9]. There is a worldwide need for frugal R&D approaches to create more value from less resources for more people. The entrepreneurial journey of frugal innovators provides an insight into the innovation process itself. Effectuation sketches theoretical representation of entrepreneurial journey. Entrepreneurs using effectuation (effectuators) extend scarce resources with their identity, knowledge, and immediate contacts; are flexible to switch new goals to go around institutional voids; do experiments to innovate; and develop partnerships to minimize uncertainty and risks [10]. Hence, it seems logical to study frugal innovation through the lens of effectuation. The practices and behaviors of entrepreneurs are influenced by ubiquitously present digital technologies. IT extends the intellectual capabilities of innovators, creating endless opportunities of innovation [4] . IT plays an enabling role in the entire value chain of frugal innovation. Entrepreneurs using effectuation under extreme resource constraints can leverage the potential of IT to conceptualize and bring to market frugal innovation products and services.	experiment;locality of reference;money;network switch;principle of good enough;purchasing	Prem Bhushan Khanal	2018		10.1145/3209626.3209631	effectuation;frugal innovation;knowledge management;business	HCI	-72.78736151114757	-2.1019417753143856	118871
01ef01540da85aea0f56ba921e432277d1f8e7bf	making an interoperability approach between erp and big data context		Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are deeply rooted as part of organisations' IT systems. These systems have attracted different types of research including project management, technological implications as well as educational research. With the new data era, it is key that studies complementing ERP and Big Data integration are well established. During the initial stage of literature analysis, it was found that interoperability was an important aspect in ERP and Big Data integration. However, there were limited studies linking ERP, Big Data and Interoperability. A thorough background analysis was therefore performed to understand state-of-the-art linking these three domains and the results are presented in this paper. First, the link between ERP, Big Data and Interoperability is discussed. Second, the main findings from the articles linking ERP, Big Data and Interoperability are highlighted. Finally, the research areas linking these three domains are derived.

It was verified the relevance of knowledge as an organizational asset, thus it evidenced the necessity to protect these assets. However, a gap to be searched was identified in the knowledge security approach in Information Science literature. Different authors identify the necessity to protect the knowledge as an organization asset, but they indicate that this subject has not been studied so much. This exploratory research was implemented like a case to verify the practical viability to the knowledge security management in the Federal Service of Data Processing (Serpro). As a result, it has been identified practical characteristics and evidences of the Knowledge Management Program and the Information Security Program in Serpro. It was also made a diagnosis using Organizational Knowledge Assessment (OKA) method and it was identified knowledge subjects in Serpro knowledge tree. Once the knowledge subjects were classified in knowledge assets and priority knowledge assets where these last ones were considered as knowledge security focus. However, a risk analysis was made to identify which risks could expose priority knowledge assets and the security measures necessary to minimize them. The score reached enabled the mapping of the knowledge security measure implemented by practices suggested in the risk analysis. But the knowledge security won‟t verify in a specific way in Knowledge Management Program and the Information Security Program in Serpro. It concludes with the presentation of basic elements for a proposal of knowledge security management model. It could contribute to introduce knowledge security management in organizations.

At the same time, practitioners are experimenting with related concepts, methods and tools aimed at creating “Innovation Enabling Climates” in their organisations. We begin this paper by suggesting a model for such “Innovation Ecology”. This model is composed of several dimensions, such as the physical space, the time space, the virtual space, the cultural space, the financial space and the human space. A second new focus area in the research of knowledge development is the role of the city as a hub for intensive flows and exchanges of knowledge between its habitants and additional actors. Similar terms such as “Knowledge cities”, “Intelligent Cities”, “Educating Cities” and “Smart Cities” are being used. We suggest weaving the learning from the business and urban worlds by attempting to apply the dimensions of innovation ecology models to knowledge cities. More specifically, we look at multiple traditional urban constructs, and show how they might (and sometimes have been for many years) significant drivers for creativity and renewal. Innovation is the process of turning knowledge and ideas into value. An “Urban Innovation Engine” is a system which can trigger, generate, foster and catalyze innovation in the city. Typically, it is a complex system that includes people, relationships, values, processes, tools and technological, physical and financial infrastructure. One possible unifying principle behind the dimensions of innovation ecology as well as innovation engines. We suggest that what Innovation Engines really do is to create Conversations – which are the foundation of most innovations. We bring some examples and snap-shots from several Urban Innovation Engines such as the Museum, the Library, the Stock Exchange, the Café’, the Brownfield, the Grand Fair, the Outlook Tower, and the Industrial District. This paper is concluded with an attempt to provide a set of guidelines for creating a knowledge city using innovation engines as its building blocks, and innovation ecology elements as an important part of its operating system.	complex system;ecology;experiment;intelligent agent;microsoft outlook for mac;operating system;smart city;usb hub;virtual reality	Ron Dvir;Edna Pásher	2004	J.

469be5826a0ee24bc46011d95ee2d316baeca9d8	development of a block level geovisualization tool of zaatari refugee camp community asset data		Geovisualization, with its capacity to provide tools for visual spatial analysis, has wide-ranging domain applications to support sense and decision making in humanitarian crisis management. The need for such tools is manifest in the Middle East in light of the Syrian civil war and ensuing mass migration of millions of refugees to neighboring countries. The Zaatari refugee camp, home to 80,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan, provides for basic needs and is actively seeking to enhance refugee social infrastructure and governance. This paper introduces the development of a Shiny geovisualization tool called “The Zaatari Project” incorporating block-level analysis of key social attributes of the Zaatari camp population by combining block-level asset survey data and OpenStreetMap data. The tool and its key feature, an interactive bivariate choropleth map, afford a technical resource for community information management to support decision making. Scenario-based evaluation of the tool was conducted in collaboration with the refuGIS team which are a group of Syrian refugees in Zaatari camp developing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) capacities for the camp under the coordination of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Evaluation findings indicate promising outcomes relating to the tool's utility to inform needs assessment and resource allocation to support the team's planning and improvement of the camp's infrastructure.	bivariate data;geographic information system;geovisualization;information management;openstreetmap;social infrastructure;spatial analysis	M.

A novel method is needed to take into account the wide-ranging and complex factors, shaping the future of the higher education system. ‘Futures’ should be devised in a multi-level structure as the bulk of trends and driving forces are international in their nature and universities are embedded in broader socio-economic systems. This new approach is demonstrated here by devising ‘cascading’ futures for the EU, the European Research and Innovation Area and universities. Several advantages can be expected from this type of prospective analysis: (i) the potential changes of these broader settings, in which universities operate, as well as their impacts on higher education can be explored; (ii) the huge diversity of higher education systems and individual universities can be reflected; and (iii) the likely impacts of different policy options can also be explored. It is also proposed to select foresight programmes from the ‘prospective toolkit’, given their specific features and benefits compared to other prospective methods.	embedded system;emergence;futures and promises;interaction;level structure;lively kernel;noise shaping;privacy policy;prospective search;requirement;responsiveness;stemming	Attila Havas	2009	Techn.

This fact had made many governments and companies reconsider and reorganize traditional schemes and methods of public management and apply more effective and efficient information management systems. Acknowledging the huge potential of Internet, more governments from both developed and developing countries are putting priority on provision of information services through the web and express interest in realization of the principles of eGovernance. Taking into consideration the role of social insurance in securing social and economic stability and protection of welfare of population, enhancement of technological and managerial capacity of social insurance agencies as well as provision of effective communication mechanisms and transparency in this area are among the top priorities of the Government of Azerbaijan. The goal of the paper is to discuss challenges, objectives, implementation strategies and achievements of the State Social Protection Fund of Azerbaijan (SSPF) in application of modern ICT and realization of the principles of e-government.	authorization;distributed computing;e-government;information management;population;social protection	Theun Bruins;Willem G.

ef4193699fb956d4bd2fc14f55c70bd27de299d8	reflections on collaborative editing research: from academic curiosity to real-world application		Nowadays, collaborative editing systems, such Google Docs, Microsoft Office Web Apps, and Codox Wave Apps (for supporting read-time editing in existing Web browser-based editors, including Gmail, Wikipedia, Evernote, and WordPress), are commonly used by hundreds of millions of people around the world. Research on collaborative editing, however, started in the 1980s as a niche area in the field of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and was initially driven mainly by academic curiosity. This niche area has evolved for decades and resulted in wide adoption in major IT industry products in recent years. In this paper, the author reflects on the evolution of collaborative editing research and application, including representative academic research projects, industrial products, and open source software projects. He will also share his views on the current trends, opportunities and challenges in future collaborative editing research and real-world applications.	amiga reflections;computer-supported cooperative work;evernote;gmail;google forms;niche blogging;office online;open-source software;web application;wikipedia;wordpress	Chengzheng Sun	2017	2017 IEEE 21st International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD)	10.1109/CSCWD.2017.8066663	world wide web;collaborative editing;microsoft office;curiosity;web application;knowledge management;computer science;data modeling;software;maintenance engineering;information technology;multimedia	HCI	-75.11842597295274	3.7049030539427923	120240

KM is broadly defined as any process or practice that involves ‘acquiring, creating, capturing, storing, sharing and using knowledge to enhance organizational performance’ (Bassi, 1997). Whilst this definition suggests a variety of practices and processes, research and practice in KM have been dominated by a focus on using Information and Communications Technologies ( ICTs) to store (data warehouses), search (data mining) and transfer (intranets, groupware) knowledge within and across organizations (Scarbrough et al, 1999). Behind much of this work lies a ‘cognitive’ model of knowledge as something that exists inside peoples’ heads, which can be extracted, codified, and made available more widely. Great claims (hype) are made then as to the performance improvements that can be achieved through the use of sophisticated IT-based tools for knowledge capture, storage and sharing. The assumption underpinning these claims is that IT can improve the stocks and flows of knowledge within a firm. On the other hand, others note that these claims typically overestimate the utility of new ITs for delivering organizational performance improvements (fiction), with evidence suggesting no direct correlation between IT investment and business performance ( Malhotra, 1998; Strassmann, 1998). This panel will explore and explain the hype, fiction and reality that shrouds KM. The panel will suggest, not that IT or IT professionals have no role to play, but that this role needs to be developed through a more reflective and contingent approach that makes it possible to align the use of IT-based KM tools with social and organizational structures and processes.	align (company);cognitive model;collaborative software;contingency (philosophy);data mining;intranet;knowledge management;stock and flow;time complexity;while;word lists by frequency	Jacky Swan;Maxine Robertson;Carsten Sørensen;Karlheinz Kautz;Sue Newell	2000			organizational structure;cognitive model;information and communications technology;exponential growth;organizational performance;organizational learning;economics;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;data warehouse;database;management;information technology;stock and flow	AI	-76.07716609848724	2.5515295507984734	120551

However, implementation constraints have restricted the technology to predominantly large corporations, thus limiting EDI's reach to a broader base of small suppliers and customers. Internet-based EDI, with significantly fewer implementation constraints, can play an important role in extending EDI benefits to a wider spectrum of businesses. Recently published articles reflect a reluctance on the part of traditional EDI users to adopt this new communication modality. The reasons for this reluctance include the newness of the Internet technology, potential Internet legislation and lack of Internet standards plus the reliability and security of data transmission within the Internet environment. This paper examines these management issues and describes existing and potential solutions available to both new and traditional EDI users. Since few companies have embraced Internet-based EDI, this paper concludes with some successful Internet EDI-based cases. Along with these cases, the authors present a very broad description of the nature of the products and services currently available in the market today to support Internet-based EDI.	edi;internet	Mireille S.

Some companies have shown interest in evaluating investment options for resource burdens and total value added across a whole-system value chain. Our EC research project developed a method for whole-system assessment of eco-innovation with multi-stakeholder cooperation. In three cases presented here, tensions arise among various aims, resource burdens, system levels, beneficiaries and timescales, thus complicating the concept of eco-innovation as a win–win strategy. Radical eco-innovation would depend on extra functions, value-chain actors and resource usages which can provide greater overall benefits. But such investment faces many systemic obstacles. Eco-innovation remains path dependent, thus limiting the scope to internalise environmental externalities. The tensions and difficulties cast doubt on an EC strategy emphasising uptake of eco-innovative technologies as the means to decouple economic growth from resource burdens.

This article elicits a set of five principles and associated criteria to help assure both the rigor and the relevance of CAR in information systems. The first principle relates to the development of an agreement that facilitates collaboration between the action researcher and the client. The second principle is based upon a cyclical process model for action research that consists of five stages: diagnosis, planning, intervention, evaluation and reflection. Additional principles highlight the critical roles of theory, change through action, and the specification of learning in terms of implications for both research and practice. The five principles are illustrated through the analysis of one recently published CAR study.	academy;ar (unix);blackwell (series);book;capstone (cryptography);communications of the acm;contextual inquiry;e-commerce;francis;fairness measure;imperative programming;information systems journal;information system;management information system;organizational behavior;pacific rim;process modeling;relevance;report;robert;synergy	Robert M.

Design/methodology/approach – A description of the knowledge management approach at ESOC (European Space Operations Centre of the European Space Agency) is provided first. At the core of this approach is the breakdown of knowledge in individual technical domains followed by coverage analysis and criticality assessment. Such a framework becomes the reference for best knowledge acquisition, transfer and storage locus identification and subsequent knowledge management practices and guidelines. Findings – KBD provides an integrated framework to account for multidisciplinary analyses and multilevel practices in knowledge capital generation, distribution and utilization. Originality/value – The collection of papers included in the annual special issue on KBD provides a representative, composite view of the research topics and applications concerns in the field. Involving a number of disciplines and levels of analysis, issues ranging from the technological gatekeeper to global knowledge flows show the interdependence of KBD concepts and tools.	criticality matrix;gatekeeper;interdependence;knowledge acquisition;knowledge management;locus;multilevel model	Francisco Javier Carrillo;Kostas S.

Wildlife translocations are a valuable conservation tool with benefits for both local communities and wildlife populations, but are often undertaken in an ad hoc fashion. In Namibia, communal conservancies present a conservation opportunity for the expansion of wildlife ranges but the economic opportunities associated with wildlife create difficult situations of having to decide who gets animals and who does not. The Wildlife Introduction Advisor is the result of experts' agreement on structuring and prioritising the main factors that need to be considered. Both the validity of the system outputs and their sensitivity to input changes were evaluated through a series of tests, which show that it is possible to use a fuzzy logic decision support system to aid the selection of translocation sites for wildlife species. A knowledge based decision support tool such as Wildlife Introduction Advisor is an effective tool for a wildlife agency because it standardises the decision making process and thus enhances transparency and management accountability.	decision support system	Barbara Paterson;Greg Stuart-Hill;Les G.

Consequently organizations are becoming aware that they must manage the creation, storage and distribution of their knowledge within the organization. However the benefits accruing from the management of knowledge can only be realized when that knowledge is reused, either by learning from past experiences in order to prevent mistakes being repeated or as a basis for innovation. The process of reuse therefore plays a pivotal role in the leveraging of knowledge assets to sustain competitive advantage in organizations. This research investigates the role of cognitive style (innovative/adaptive) of an individual and how it influences the way in which he/she uses a knowledge repository. A study, using the Kirton Adaption-Innovation Inventory, was carried out in the customer support department of a large electronics company. The implications of the findings are discussed and further research directions are recommended.	customer support;experience;knowledge management	Fergal McGrath;Catherine Parkes	2004	Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration, 2004.

They are challenged to do the same amount of work or more with less human and financial resources. Skilled temporary staff provides great financial flexibility and expertise to eradicate extra work load and over expenditure in today's economy. Temporary workers can provide special skills and knowledge to carry out specific assignments. """"The latest federal data show that 2.3 million people held temporary jobs in March 2011, up from a low in mid-2009 of 1.7 million, as companies seek to satisfy customer demand without making long-term commitments to worker salary and benefits""""[2]. With this increasingly significant role of temporary workforce in today's enterprise, rural outsourcing patterns present a unique strategy to maximize the utilization of transient workers. For the past decade or so, hiring and retaining from the local consulting firms is not the only available option. Today, more and more organizations are looking for other economic and strategic options such as utilizing the off-shore firms to assist them with their immediate needs. When the term """"off-site"""" or """"off-shore"""" is mentioned, people think of China or India, but recently there is a growing trend of rural sourcing within the USA. These patterns present a unique opportunity to utilize the rural consulting firms and treat their skilled professionals as an extension of your team to satisfy customer demand without making long-term commitments to worker salary and employee benefits. These temporary expert professionals are kept in a """"ready-state"""" at a rural location and can be activated at a moment's notice."""	job stream;off-site data protection;outsourcing;plop;pattern language (formal languages);technical standard	Kamal W.

In this context, questions of personal data privacy, security, access, control and (dis-)empowerment are critical considerations for system designers and policy makers alike. To explore the family perspective on this landscape of what we call Family Civic Data, we carried out ethnographic interviews with four North-East families. Our design-game-based interviews were effective for engaging both adults and children to talk about the impact of this dry, technical topic on their lives. Our findings, delivered in the form of design guidelines, show support for dynamic consent: families would feel most empowered if involved in an ongoing co-operative relationship with state welfare and civic authorities through shared interaction with their data."""	big data;confidentiality;database;eclipse;expectation propagation;holism;information privacy;personally identifiable information;programming paradigm;requirement	Alex Bowyer;Kyle Montague;Stuart Wheater;Ruth McGovern;Raghu Lingam;Madeline Balaam	2018		10.1145/3173574.3173710	multimedia;public policy;public relations;big data;information privacy;health care;welfare;data sharing;computer science;user-centered design;empowerment	HCI	-75.81549958914249	-5.451538578430928	122341

We hope by discussing the many unique problems and challenges facing these fast evolving and somewhat related research disciplines, we could share lessons learned and develop insights for advancing our knowledge and achieving successful organizational transformation. A detailed case study of a research project (COPLINK) jointly funded by the NSF Digital Library and Digital Government Programs in the area of crime data mining will be presented in detail. We discuss how advanced visual crime mining techniques such as association rule mining, social network analysis, deception detection, temporal-spatial visualization, and agents could become the catalyst for assisting intelligence and law enforcement agencies in capturing knowledge and creating transformation.	digital library	Hsinchun Chen	2002		10.1007/3-540-36227-4_4	social network analysis;digital library;project;computer science;information mapping;artificial intelligence;data mining;database;data analysis;law;information technology;world wide web;computer security;information system;government	SE	-71.25827582395631	-5.512767700607532	122512
abb1ec104f128213727818044d2cc47cf2c01697	demand response in smart grids: research opportunities for the is discipline		Information systems are going to play a key role in making today’s electricity grids smarter and, in this way, will enable the energy turnaround from fossil to renewable energy sources. One of the approaches to cope with the intermittent feed-in of renewable energy is demand response, i.e. the demand side responds to requirements and price signals from the electricity grid. As yet, the supply side still largely responds to the demand by trying to generate the electricity that is currently needed. Since the huge coordination task of demand response in smart grids strictly requires information systems, this contribution analyzes existing information systems (IS) research contributions on this subject. Subsequently, we identify underrepresented areas by comparing our findings with the research of related disciplines and research projects funded by the European Union (EU). Finally, we discuss selected open issues and conclude by illustrating what the identified white spots mean for the smart grid’s success and provide guidance for future IS research and development.	database;fossil;information systems research;information system;requirement;smart tv;web search engine	Jens Strüker;Clemens van Dinther	2012			construction engineering;environmental resource management;management science;business	Metrics	-75.60159437101865	-5.665295301445734	122547

These risks were detected with a novel approach to information security. It is based on the philosophy that information security risk monitoring should include human and societal factors, and that collaboration between organisations and experts is essential to gain knowledge about potential risks. The methodology uses a mixed methods approach including a quantitative analysis of historical security incident data and expert elicitation through a Delphi study. The result is an overview of the possible socio-technical risks that a panel of experts expect to materialise in health care organisations in the near future. These risks include (amongst others): staff leaving data assets unattended on the premises and these assets consequently go missing, staff sharing passwords to access patient data and staff sending email containing personal patient data to the wrong addressee thus disclosing data to unauthorised persons. The expert panel recognized risks from current discussion topics such as outsourcing, but these risks are still considered to appear less frequently than the more traditional information security risks. Furthermore, the panel did not estimate a high frequency of occurrence of socio-technical information security risks caused by new technologies such as cloud computing or RFID.	authorization;cloud computing;email;information security;outsourcing;password;radio-frequency identification;sociotechnical system	Nicole van Deursen;William J.

Sebagian perusahaan telah mulai menetapkan sejumlah kode etik, yiatu segala pernyataan perusahaan mengenai etika, hukum, atau kebijakan yang mendefinisikan standar untuk tingkah laku suatu kelompok. Para manajer percaya bahwa keberadaan kode etik ini penting untuk mengurangi tingkah laku pegawai dalam menyalahgunakan komputer, terutama terhadap pegawai Sistem Informasi yang memang mempunyai pengetahuan lebih dalam daripada pegawai lainnya. Masalah yang timbul dari kondisi adalah munculnya 2 pertanyaan: 1) Apakah kode etik ini benar-benar bisa mengurangi tingkah laku tidak etis dari para pegawai Sistem Informasi? 2) Apakah efek dari kode ini dipengaruhi oleh sisi psikologis para pegawai Sistem Informasi?	code;controller (control theory);cybercrime;yang	Susan J.

The law has treated information, in most common law jurisdictions, as not being property. Consequently, it is not possible at common law to steal information. In Australia, the Federal Government has recently brought into force a suite of legislation that has the purpose of deterring hackers who unlawfully try to gain access to a computers located in Australia. Further there have been a number of recent judicial determinations that now impose a positive duty upon management (Directors and Officers of a corporation) to implement reasonable steps to prevent a crime from being effected against the corporation. This positive duty includes the protection of information assets of the corporation from hacker attacks and loss of information and its value. Hence computer security is now a board issue in Australia and not just an IT issue.

In this paper we apply agent-based modeling and simulation to investigate a set of problems in a retail context. Specifically, we are working to understand the relationship between human resource management practices and retail productivity. Despite the fact we are working within a relatively novel and complex domain, it is clear that intelligent agents could offer potential for fostering sustainable organizational capabilities in the future. Our research so far has led us to conduct case study work with a top ten UK retailer, collecting data in four departments in two stores. Based on our case study data we have built and tested a first version of a department store simulator. In this paper we will report on the current development of our simulator which includes new features concerning more realistic data on the pattern of footfall during the day and the week, a more differentiated view of customers, and the evolution of customers over time. This allows us to investigate more complex scenarios and to analyze the impact of various management practices.	agent-based model;intelligent agent;simulation	Peer-Olaf Siebers;Uwe Aickelin;Helen Celia;Chris W.

89637477d22475ebcc58ff7343d48c309fe1a6bf	an unambiguous language for systems process design and engineering		This research focuses on a language for specifying the necessary, sufficient and efficient capabilities of a system, particularly the processes by which a system responds to external stimuli and sustains internal integrity. Because process decisions are the more numerous in system design the ability of designers to exchange process knowledge becomes increasingly crucial as system extent, variety and ambiguity increases. This is particularly evident when designers must devise autonomous systems that learn, foster learning and even generate new capabilities from their repertoire of processes. System engineering literature has not provided a comprehensive taxonomy of system processes. The text most often used to train systems engineering students cites only a very small number of systems processes1. Fortunately, systems biology and basic systems science research have already identified a robust taxonomy. We will use the System Processes and Linkage Propositions as clarified by Systems Processes Theory (SPT) 2,3 as a reference and compare several actual physical and sociotechnical models to the reference set. One objective is to determine the degree to which the quality, parsimony and beauty of a system model can be improved by using the reference repertoire. If MBSE can be improved by the reference set, and SPT detail helps us understand systems dynamics more deeply, then it may further help use explain and improve systems sustainability and resilience. A second objective is to determine the effect on designer productivity and innovation. A third is to evolve an ontology for computer-aided system composition. The research plan seeks to involve volunteer co-learners from various domains in this endeavor. © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

To secure government funding and demonstrate that the NDA is delivering its mission, it must be able to show that it provides value for money across its estate. Value comes in many forms, such as an improved environment, hazard reduction, changes in sky line, social amenities, money, employment, and so forth. Depending on the perspective of the receiver, and their closeness to the affected area, the weighting placed on the different aspects of value will vary. Therefore, the challenge has been to get a consistent approach that measures value and is broadly acceptable to stakeholders in which different aspects are compared and decisions are made on a national basis.

There are many interpretive research methods of which ethnography is one. Ethnography is an approach adopted from anthropology and used by information systems researchers to gain an understanding of information systems in organizations. It is currently treated in the information systems discipline as a single approach with no significant differences between researchers who adopt ethnography. Now that interpretive methods have gained a stance in the information systems discipline, it has become more acceptable to explore differences both across and within methods. This panel explores current differences seen as being relevant within ethnography. The panel does not attempt to reconcile the differences but, rather, to open up debate so that variety can be introduced to this area of interpretive information systems research. This allows for the ethnographic information systems researcher to be introduced to a wider choice on qualitative methods	information systems research;information system;systems theory	Ojelanki K.

By this we intend appropriate declarations made at the level of rationale, future plans and strategies to achieve intended goals and most importantly how those achievements will impact on various aspects of societal life, from legal responsibilities to moral and socio economic issues. In some public spheres these issues are becoming quite controversial because automation opens up possibilities of profound structural re-organization; however, we lack a discussion across and within different work domains to help us review methods or even methodological principles needed to gather and organize knowledge towards the construction of automation policies. This paper uses a service organization from the Air Traffic Management Domain, NATS, as a case study to illustrate an example of an organization currently undertaking critical self-reflection about automation policy or lack of such, along with the illustration of some unresolved deep concerns raised by the development, introduction, and continued use of automation.

Historically, low-impact intrusion into species habitats arose from local demands for food, fuel and living space. However, in today’s increasingly globalized economy, international trade chains accelerate habitat degradation far removed from the place of consumption. Although adverse effects of economic prosperity and economic inequality have been confirmed, the importance of international trade as a driver of threats to species is poorly understood. Here we show that a significant number of species are threatened as a result of international trade along complex routes, and that, in particular, consumers in developed countries cause threats to species through their demand of commodities that are ultimately produced in developing countries. We linked 25,000 Animalia species threat records from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List to more than 15,000 commodities produced in 187 countries and evaluated more than 5 billion supply chains in terms of their biodiversity impacts. Excluding invasive species, we found that 30% of global species threats are due to international trade. In many developed countries, the consumption of imported coffee, tea, sugar, textiles, fish and other manufactured items causes a biodiversity footprint that is larger abroad than at home. Our results emphasize the importance of examining biodiversity loss as a global systemic phenomenon, instead of looking at the degrading or polluting producers in isolation. We anticipate that our findings will facilitate better regulation, sustainable supply-chain certification and consumer product labelling.	animals;biodiversity informatics;certification;coffee;dental intrusion;elegant degradation;habitat;intrinsic drive;large;social inequality;tea;threat (computer);hearing impairment	Manfred Lenzen;Daniel Moran;Keiichiro Kanemoto;Barney Foran;Leonarda Lobefaro;Arne Geschke	2012	Nature	10.1038/nature11145	biology;biodiversity;environmental protection;environmental resource management;wildlife;invasive species;endangered species;ecology;information technology		-75.70049160191306	-9.384609161852172	125433
93ed530b0288e6641fe1829344853aab34a6217f	managing social engineering attacks- considering human factors and security investment		Soliciting and managing the protection of information assets has become a objective of paramount importance in an organizational context. Information Security Management System (ISMS) has the unique role of ensuring that adequate and appropriate security tools are in place in order to protect information assets. Security is always seen in three dimensions of technology, organization, and people. Undoubtedly, the socio-technical challenges have proven to be the most difficult ones to tackle. Social Engineering Attacks (SEAs) are a sociotechnical challenge and considerably increase security risks by seeking access to information assets by exploiting the vulnerabilities in organizations as they target human frailties. Dealing effectively and adequately with SEAs requires practical security benchmarking together with control mechanism tools, which in turn requires investment to support security and ultimately organizational goals. This paper contributes in this area. In particular, the paper proposes a language for managing SEAs using several concepts such as actor, risks, goals, security investment and vulnerabilities. The language supports in-depth investigation of human factors as one of the main causes of SEAs. It also assists in the selection of appropriate mechanisms considering security investment to mitigate risks. Finally, the paper uses a real incident in a financial institution to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.	asset (computer security);freedom of information laws by country;human factors and ergonomics;information security;management system;security management;social engineering (security);sociotechnical system;synthetic environment for analysis and simulations	Reza Alavi;Shareeful Islam;Haris Mouratidis;Sin Lee	2015			asset (computer security);financial institution;benchmarking;security engineering;sociotechnical system;environmental resource management;social engineering (security);information security management system;business;vulnerability	Security	-73.27882389159556	-7.217776988567994	125456

This paper provides a discussion of the authors' current National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded project involving TCIS, with specific reference to its use in emergency response and related e-government services. The project includes the development of a general framework for understanding and researching the end-to-end performance of inter-organizational e-governmental services and findings from an expert workshop held at the National Center for Digital Government. The TCIS invitational workshop allowed for expert (academic and practitioner) input and feedback on the TCIS dimensions and the best means for understanding their occurrence in on-the-ground emergency medical services (EMS). Workshop participants analyzed TCIS from a socio-technical perspective and provided conceptual, practitioner and methodological critiques and suggestions. Overall, participants found the concept of TCIS to be a valid model for understanding, researching, and developing e-government systems within the specific context of emergency response as well as within the broader context of time-critical services to the public. Workshop recommendations focused on the need to closely assess inter-agency and inter-organizational information exchanges along and between three levels: technical, organizational, and governance.	e-government;end-to-end principle;sociotechnical system;window of opportunity	Thomas A.

As the man evolves, he is creating new ways of communicating information to survive and to improve his quality of life. With globalization there is a reduction in transport and communication costs, as well as global logistics and distribution systems, which allows to be distributed products, including agri-food, where it comes from, to reach all the world. Regardless of other technologies, ICT are leading to the globalization, and one of the sectors affected by globalization, is the food industry. This article develop a set of data elements, which are constituted as a body of knowledge about technologies aspects, including technological developments, the main types of technologies and information systems, technological trends and some marketing aspects in the agri-food sector that contribute to its sustainability.	information system	José Luís Reis	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-31232-3_26	sustainability organizations;agricultural economics;knowledge management;environmental resource management	NLP	-77.14008444308695	3.852569622149001	125518

This paper sets out how these principles might be reshaped, allowing strategic behaviour to be tackled more successfully.		E. F.

New speedy, smart and simple processes are imperative. Existing processes should stay unnoticed, when these new processes are modeled. The development of the new Austrian state budgeting and bookkeeping system has followed these new paradigms and has brought impressive rationalisation effects. 1 Process Reengineering as Base for E-Government 1.1 A New E-Government Paradigm E-Government brings a shift of paradigms. The mere functioning of an authority’s processes and structures is no longer adequate. Customer service is now in the focus of interest; regardless whether customers act in the role of citizens (in case of G2Capplications) or in the role of company employees (in case of G2B) or even as civil servants just using e-Government applications of other authorities (in case of G2Gcooperations). Speediness, smartness and simplicity for the users are necessary conditions to provide these expected new services. Last but not least attention to cost efficiency and economy has to be paid. 1.2 New E-Government Processes This new e-Government paradigm generates great demands for new governmental processes. Existing paper driven processes often include lots of auxiliary steps, just coming from the paper world. These auxiliary steps are partly carried out by divisions responsible for the main duty, partly by specific auxiliary support divisions. Therefore these old paper driven processes are not a good basis for creating new e-Government processes. All these paper steps have the effect of big blinkers, which obstruct the view to the real and basic needs of organisation and users. Therefore existing processes and structures of organisations should stay unnoticed first!	code refactoring;cost efficiency;e-government;imperative programming;programming paradigm	Josef Makolm	2003		10.1007/10929179_58	business process reengineering;management	Logic	-74.58906621290103	3.742849329816527	125920

Findings – Since 2003 public libraries have been the subject of sustained interest from UK government, in the form of a range of policy initiatives and incorporation in the Best Value and more recent Common Area Assessment monitoring frameworks. Alongside this, professional bodies and other commentators have put forward views on the role of libraries, but even taken together it is not clear that these represent the needs or aspirations of library service users. Originality/value – This paper provides an overview of the demand for UK public libraries, and its synthesis will be of value to librarians, government departments and professionals in this and related fields.	book;cost efficiency;librarian;library (computing);public library;strand (programming language);top-down and bottom-up design;virtual community	Alan Boughey;Mike Cooper	2010	Aslib Proceedings	10.1108/00012531011034982	public policy;public relations;sociology;public administration;management;law;government	HCI	-75.1146303971239	-8.37742515535571	126283

4cfdba735ec375c8f7532aca85933d83a1191f1e	against the shadow: the role of e-government	e government;shadow economy;growth;developing countries;public administration	The shadow economy is defined as economic activities which escape from detection in the official estimates of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). They erode the tax bases and reduce tax revenue, forcing the government to find other sources to finance their spending. The size of shadow economies is associated with a higher inflation rate, public debt, and unemployment, hence becoming a crucial problem to mitigate, especially in the developing countries. This paper aims to see a possible contribution of e-Government (eGov) implementation to reduce the shadow economy. If institutional and regulatory problems are addressed by introducing eGov, we can avoid predatory and obstructive regulations. This will lower compliance costs and the administrative burdens which have been addressed as among major factors affecting the shadow economy. We investigate this phenomenon on a panel of 128 countries during the period 2003-2013, where the data on shadow economy [1] and the eGov index [2] are both available. The analysis shows that the increasing eGov index significantly reduces the size of the shadow economy. We also found that shadow economy is a latent phenomenon and that the impact of eGov will be greatly conditioned by the severity of the historical phenomenon of the shadow economy.	e-government;shadow copy	Ibrahim Kholilul Rohman;Linda Veiga	2017		10.1145/3085228.3085321	economics;public economics;economy;economic growth	AI	-75.44854626442412	-8.726456824984576	126856

While examining the importance of research in such a context, the paper attempts to outline a first definition of the role and potential of policy research. The policy process itself has become increasingly complex and non linear, as has its relationship with research. Consequently, policy researchers’ contributions to policymakers may not have a direct, punctual and immediate influence on single issues, but rather a more pervasive, interactive, deliberative effect. Focusing on the theoretical definition of the risk, uncertainty and complexity of the policy process today, the paper outlines some questions and puts forward possible answers which offer a starting point for further analysis. It explores a new role for policy research and underlines the opportunities offered by argumentative, deliberative and multidisciplinary approaches which can positively impact democracy.	complexity;pervasive informatics;theoretical definition	Alessandro Colombo	2010	Intelligent Information Management	10.4236/iim.2010.211071	public policy;complexity;scientific method;uncertainty;policy analysis;data mining;management science;policy studies	AI	-77.22587549916003	-2.895015890589994	127195

High importance is seen also in fostering citizens' participation in political and social life and increasing the transparency of public authorities. The forerunners of the open data movement in the public sector are the USA and the UK, which started to open their public data resources in 2009. The first European Union open data related directive was drawn up as early as 2003; however progress in putting the idea into practice has been slow and adoptions by the wider member states are placed in the early 2010s. The beneficial use of open data in real applications has progressed hand in hand with the improvement of other ICT-related technologies. The (raw) data itself has no high value. The economic value comes from a balanced combination of high quality open (data) resources combined with the related value chain.

Cultural resource management is increasingly being conducted as heritage management in the larger context of ecosystem management or ecological stewardship. Cultural resources are an important factor in the human environment, and must be managed in the context of all other biological, social, and geophysical elements in that environment or ecosystem. Good environmental stewardship requires affirmative resource management, including management of our tangible and intangible cultural resources. Many scientists are involved in cultural resource management, either directly or indirectly and either consciously or unconsciously. There is increased public awareness of the value of cultural resources, and their protection involves the knowledgeable and caring collaboration of resource specialists (e.g., anthropologists, archaeologists, architects, archivists, engineers, folklorists, historians), material scientists, decision-making land managers, and the living community with ties to the heritage resources. This in turn involves each participating community and individual (including the scientists) managing the interfaces among themselves. This is done by learning something about (and learning to appreciate) other groups' values and special languages and their operating constraints and opportunities, and about the overall public benefits and costs of cultural resource management decisions.

These products are defined as techno-medical products including various categories of products such as simple medicines, advanced technological systems, etc. Despite the high performance, the enlargement and the increasing trends of the field, it is not recorded the expected progress in the methods and the ways of promotion, trading and supporting of these products in the market. The present paper aims at the investigation of the consumers' opinion and the specification of those services that are possible to be implemented in electronic services and commerce for a strongly competitive advantage for the enterprises of the sector.

In this paper, the authors develop and validate a conceptual framework that captures the unique characteristics of information security regulations and their impact on demand for IAM technologies, and the innovation and market value of IAM firms. Using paired two-sample for means t-tests and the Chow test, the authors demonstrate that the annual changes in sales of IAM firms from 1998 to 2008 are higher than those of other information technology (IT) firms around the time that information security regulations were enacted. The vector autoregression analyses show that IAM innovation is demand-driven, consistent with Schmookler’s “demand-pull” hypothesis, and has been positively valued by stock market investors. As such, our results demonstrate how policy makers can stimulate innovation and increase shareholder wealth by regulating IT consumers.

In this paper, we postulate that by targeting consumers of IT products, such as hospitals, banks, and a multitude of other organizations where IT products are used, information security regulations have driven the demand for information security products and services, and have, in turn, indirectly stimulated innovation by information security firms. We focus our study on a thriving industry segment of information security, namely identity and access management (IAM). IAM has gained prominence because of the role that IAM technologies play in facilitating the seamless access of customers, employees, and third parties to the numerous IT resources of an enterprise. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidance of November 2005 specifically addresses the need for IAM by recommending that financial institutions and their application service providers (ASPs) deploy security measures to reliably authenticate their online banking customers through using multifactor authentication, biometrics, layered security, and other reasonable controls that mitigate security risks. Although commerce using physical markets has traditionally allowed the anonymous purchase of goods and services, transactions in virtual marketplaces mandate the use of a real identity that is traceable to its owner. IAM services allow the provisioning of individualized security and access rights, based on a person’s identity, and, as such, refer to the technologies, processes, policies, and supporting infrastructures necessary for the deployment, control, and maintenance of digital identities and their access to resources. A digital identity contains data that uniquely describe a person or a thing, referred to as a subject or an entity, and encompasses information about the subject’s relationships with other entities. We propose that the recent surge in demand for IAM, while driven by information security regulations, has constituted an economic incentive for IAM firms to innovate and has, in turn, boosted the stock price of IAM firms. In an attempt to study how information security regulations are driving IAM innovation and the market value of IAM firms, we first study the change in demand for IAM products and services around the enactment of information security regulations. We then examine the relationship between demand, innovation, and market value by addressing the following research questions: 1. How significant has the change in sales growth of IAM products been compared to other IT products around the time that information security regulations were enacted? 2. Has this growth in sales, in turn, driven innovation on the part of IAM firms? 3. How significantly have investors valued innovation by IAM firms? To investigate these questions, we develop a consumer-producer framework that is founded on theories related to innovation and the economics of regulations. The proposed framework is a major contribution of this paper, as it demonstrates how regulations can indirectly drive innovation by boosting demand (Khansa, 2008). Studying the demand-pull hypothesis in various settings is not a new endeavor. In the 1960s, Schmookler started his investigation of the role of demand in inducing technical progress. Despite the growing interest in investigating the unique aspects of the information security sector, we have not been able to find any research that has answered the important question of, “What drives innovation in information security?” Given the unique traits of the information security sector that has been witnessing a swell in regulatory requirements and an ever-present maliciousness from hackers, this question is of legitimate theoretical and practical value. On the methodology front, our analysis uses sound methodologies and offers a solution to the problem of lack of hard data to quantify demand. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first present a detailed scenario that clarifies the technological components and processes involved in identity and access management, and summarize the business value of IAM. We then conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on innovation, regula80 Information Resources Management Journal, 25(3), 78-97, July-September 2012 Copyright © 2012, IGI Global.

Next, we present the research design, including data collection, measures used, and vector autoregression analysis model. We follow with the results of our study. Lastly, we discuss the conclusions, contributions, and limitations of the study, and set avenues for future research. IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT Figure 1 summarizes the important technological components of IAM, their various functions, and the related benefits to enterprises and other stakeholders. IAM technology components encompass: (1) a digital identity, (2) directory repository and services, (3) access management, and (4) account management. To illustrate the scope and functions of these technological components, we present a comprehensive scenario that depicts a user’s access to a networked resource. The depiction begins with the issuance of a digital ID to the user, and ends with the termination of the user’s access to resources. 1. To facilitate access to networked resources, a user is first issued a digital identity with a unique identifier (e.g., username) that is assigned to a specific context, such as acFigure 1.

The associated digital credentials prove something about the owner of the identity and describe attributes that are inherent to the owner (e.g., fingerprints) or assigned to that identity (e.g., a password), or roles that the user has been assigned (e.g., system administrator). 2. The information used to verify the credentials is organized in a directory, which consists of a repository, i.e., a database that holds the information about the digital identities within its scope, and a set of software applications that manage the storage and access to the directory (Bhatti, Bertino, & Ghafoor, 2007). A typical example of such a directory service is X.500 and the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), a common protocol used to access directory information. The directory also serves as a means for enforcing security policies. 3. The authentication of the user involves establishing confidence in the claims made by the user about the digital identity. This is followed by authorization that maps the user’s identity to privileges or roles and access control, a step that ensures that the user has the right entitlements to access resources. The auditing process ensures that records related to user access are scrutinized and maintained appropriately (Księżopolski & Kotulski, 2007). 4. Several account management tasks are involved in the lifecycle of the user’s possession of a digital identity. An important component is the management of passwords, which includes a registration system, self-service or assisted reset, and synchronization of password changes. User provisioning involves the ability to create new user login accounts on various systems, to alter existing user login accounts, and to manage keys and tokens such as passwords and digital certificates. Deprovisioning upon termination of a user’s privileges ensures that access to all resources is revoked and related accounts are expunged. Figure 1 also provides a bird’s-eye view of related IAM benefits to enterprises and other stakeholders. At the enterprise level, IAM provides managers with the ability to streamline access to resources, thus facilitating better command and control over the corporate network. IAM offers significant reduction in total cost of ownership specifically given the operational efficiencies achieved. In particular, there is less wasted time associated with account access and insignificant costs associated with manually purging user accounts and trying to figure out who has access to what. Efficient provisioning means end users are able to spend more time doing their jobs instead of waiting for the help desk to reset a password, or give them access to a business application. Many business processes have become electronic, thus facilitating application integration and workflow management.	access control;adobe streamline;authorization;autoregressive model;biometrics;bird's-eye view;business process;business software;credential;digital identity;directory service;elisa bertino;entity;fingerprint;identifier;identity management;imperative programming;information security;job stream;layered security;lightweight directory access protocol;login;map;multi-factor authentication;norm (social);online banking;password;provisioning;public key certificate;requirement;seamless3d;software deployment;system administrator;theory;total cost of ownership;traceability;unique key;user (computing);vector autoregression;workstation;x.500	Lara Khansa;Divakaran Liginlal	2012	IRMJ	10.4018/irmj.2012070104	public relations;innovation;economics;knowledge management;marketing;market value;management;world wide web;computer security;demand	Security	-72.65339056077693	-8.557630977169191	127691

These changes do not bring just minor technological improvements, but indeed a fundamental transformation of our industry-based society into an information-based one. The changes are most visible and documented within the business world, but the synergy between technological and social shifts does not stop there. In this paper we try to identify and summarize key trends and challenges which this development puts before us.	blueprint;computability theory;computational complexity theory;information revolution;positive feedback;speedup;stepping level;synergy;time complexity	Jirí Zlatuska	1997		10.1007/3-540-63774-5_115	information processing;computer science;artificial intelligence;operations research;information technology;information system	DB	-71.5081609091124	-5.524411856614109	127885

It is the purpose of this paper to explore the relationship between the telecommunications equipment market and U.S. telecommunication policy. To this end we will first survey the traditional pattern of supplying hardware and equipment within the communications common carrier industry and second, identify recent challenges to that industry's conduct and practices. We will conclude that public policy holds a key variable in promoting competitive access to the telecommunication equipment market---access that will redound to the benefit of equipment suppliers, communication carriers, and ultimately the general public.	computer;interdependence	Manley R.

Negative consequences are rarely intended, but they can often be foreseen with careful sociotechnical analysis in advance of system building. Motivated by an interest in extremely complex sociotechnical contexts (e.g., mortgage lending and automated trading) where ICT appears to be having negative consequences in addition to many benefits, this paper identifies and evaluates future-oriented problem analysis and solution design tools in three potentially relevant literatures: 1) ICT ethics, 2) environmental sustainability, and 3) technology hazards. Several promising future-oriented technology analysis techniques (e.g., anticipatory technology ethics, technology roadmapping, morphological analysis, and control structure analysis) were found and are discussed in this paper, but much work remains to be done to customize them, integrate them, and codify them for use in education and high-quality IS research on very complex sociotechnical contexts like the global financial network.	algorithmic trading;control flow;grand challenges;hazard (computer architecture);problem solving;sociotechnical system	M.

The research, carried out over a five-year period, set those activities in a context in which they have not commonly been considered: the organisations which create the information products; and it sought to illuminate them with relevant research and practice from the disciplines concerned with information science and information design. The present article compares the findings reported two years into the research with the situation by the end, three years later; and ends with proposals for practical application of the outcomes to help organisations in managing their information products more strategically and effectively.

In this paper we discuss some of those challenges as stemming from issues such as the productivity paradox, level of measurement, choice of metrics and the process of measurement. Further, we discuss those characteristics that make investments in E-business environment different from other types of IT investment. In doing so, we draw upon the contribution of the papers in this special issue of Information Systems Frontiers and conclude with our proposal for areas where further research needs to be conducted.

76474f13ef8987e705ee5725d239faf392d113e6	learning on the job: supporting the evolution of designse		System design is the process of finding a suitable solution in the abstract space of possible design variants. As design progresses, we identify and evaluate potential design alternatives, learning in the process not only about possible solutions but, if we are doing it right, about the problem on hand. (A wise man once noted: If you think about a problem long enough, you will always find a better way of solving it.) Engineering models can and should play a fundamental role in this process, supporting both understanding and invention. In this talk, we first present a view of design as a search problem (which clearly distinguishes it from the closely related project management process with which it is often confused). From this perspective, we identify and categorize the issues involved in design and focus in particular on where and how models and model-based technologies can help overcome them. The talk concludes with a list of related research challenges for the modeling community.	categorization;search problem	Bran Selic	2013			business;knowledge management;job performance	AI	-75.51073258400245	0.24044907164533527	128932

Numerous research efforts exist, attempting to develop systems to abide by and ensure optimal evacuation guidance from disaster areas. Existing safety systems fail to guide effectively the most vulnerable travelers and to take into consideration the mobility impairment of each individual. In this context, current work elaborates on the issue by proposing a robust evacuation mechanism, incorporated in a Decision Support System. The innovative solution is to provide group-wise optimal routes to the exits, along with personalized routing, taking into account user capabilities and preferences. As a further step, the rescue teams are provided with a plan including prioritized targets with trapped travelers. The paper provides a thorough analysis of existing evacuation models and mechanisms, presents the DSS architecture and embedded algorithms, and discusses its performance.	decision support system;real-time transcription	Iraklis Tsekourakis;Christos Orlis;Dimosthenis Ioannidis;Dimitrios Tzovaras	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-34050-5_1	construction engineering;transport engineering;business;computer security	Robotics	-64.16321912358092	3.5678230092276815	129027

175f517c7b8b320cc14132d378ea01d7a5fd2dbd	essays on internet governance		Expecting tremendous social and economic implications of digital platforms and infrastructures, firms and governments across the world are making huge investments in creating and maintaining these infrastructures, health information systems and the Internet being the two striking examples. However, with growth, concerns related to their standardization, control and governance become significant. The Internet is a global information infrastructure [5] and to restrict its unintended consequences, positive steps towards its design and governance is being sought by researchers [6] and practitioners alike. I study three different aspects of Internet governance. The three questions that I analyze in my dissertation are: (1) What country level factors (institutional quality) impact a nation’s choice of Internet governance structure and what is the role of Internet affordances in the relationship?; (2) How does the proportion of Internet-deprived population (i.e. the extent of digital divide) affect the impact which zero-rating plans can have on an economy?; (3) Critically analyzing the current discourse on net neutrality and questioning the assumptions on which it is defined currently.	information system;internet;net neutrality;unintended consequences;zero-rating	Neena Pandey	2017		10.1145/3084381.3084431	internet governance;business;economic growth	HCI	-76.99404765999499	-8.548001334626155	129213

Although, many multi-criteria decision making methods have been proposed to evaluate and examine the effectiveness of Elearning, there is a lack of study concerning systematic literature review and classification of research in this area. Regarding this, five major databases including Science direct, Emerald, Taylor and Francis, IEEE, and Springer have been selected and a systematic methodology proposed. Consequently, a review of 42 published papers appearing in 33 academic journals and international conferences between 2001 and 2015 have been obtained to achieve a comprehensive review of MCDM application in E-learning. Accordingly, the selected papers have been classified by the year of publication, MCDM techniques, and journals and conferences in which they appeared. In addition, the significant criteria in evaluating E-learning were found. This study supports researchers and practitioners in effectively adopting MCDM techniques regarding E-learning evaluation and provides an insight into its state-of-the-art.	database;emerald;francis;interdependence;malaysian identity card;springer (tank);systematic review;text simplification	Mojtaba Zare;Christina Pahl;Hamed Rahnama;Mehrbakhsh Nilashi;Abbas Mardani;Othman Ibrahim;Hossein Ahmadi	2016	Appl.

Although the number of SMEs adopting new IS innovations has increased over time, strong empirical evidence is still lacking. This paper aims to fill this gap by reporting the findings of a survey on SMEs located in the Northwest of England. The survey results reveal that even more complex IS innovations are increasingly adopted by SMEs. Also, nearly half of the surveyed SMEs are willing to adopt ES in the next three years. These findings suggest that there is a considerable opportunity and a need for further research in the adoption and diffusion of new IS innovations among SMEs.	enterprise system;information systems	Boumediene Ramdani;Oswaldo Lorenzo;Peter Kawalek	2009	IJEA	10.4018/jea.2009010103	superconducting magnetic energy storage;enterprise system;computer science;marketing;diffusion;is;world wide web;information system;commerce	Web+IR	-75.5860120476728	2.7977818223995516	129409

59f24a4db1ca1c862f736182d681c62f4ed52eb2	service systems in changing paradigms: an inquiry through the systems sciences		For professionals at the beginning of the 21st century, much of the conventional wisdom on business management and engineering is founded in the 20th century industrial / manufacturing paradigm. In developed economies, however, the service sector now dominates the manufacturing sector, just as manufacturing prevailed over the agricultural sector after the industrial revolution. This chapter proposes the development of a body of knowledge on services systems, based on foundations in the systems sciences. The approach includes the design of the systems of inquiry, acknowledging that body of knowledge on 21 century service systems is relatively nascent. A program of action science is proposed, with an emphasis on multiple realities and knowledge development through dialectic. The outcome pursued is an increased number of T-shaped people with depth and breadth in service systems, in communities of inquiry of researchers and practitioners.

Given this status, South African researchers have a moral obligation to share their research output with the rest of the continent via a medium that minimizes challenges of access; open scholarship is that medium. The majority of South African higher education libraries provide an open access publishing service. However, in most of these cases this service is via engagement with the green open access route, that is, institutional repositories (IR). Some of the libraries have piloted and adopted gold open access services such as publishing of “diamond” gold open access journals and supporting article processing charges. The experiment with publishing open monographs is a new venture. This venture must be viewed against the backdrop of the need for open educational resources (OERs). OER is an area that is very much in a fledgling stage and is gaining traction, albeit, at a slow pace. The growth of IRs, the growth in support for gold open access including the library acting as a publisher, the experimentation with open monographs, and OERs are all shaping South Africa’s scholarly publishing roadmap.

7e8f9f263bb20c275343d3062d93e3aefae9e07d	what are we really good at? product strategy with uncertain capabilities		Firms often learn about their own capabilities through their products’ successes and failures. This paper explores the interaction between such learning from experience and product strategy in a formal model. We consider a firm that can launch a sequence of products, where each product’s performance depends on the fit between the firm’s capabilities and the product. A successful new product always causes the firm to become more optimistic about the capability most relevant for that product; however, it can also cause the firm to become less optimistic about some of its other capabilities, including capabilities the new product does not use. A product launch generates useful information for future decisions if it leads to learning about capabilities used by potential future products. We find that a product sharing few or even no capabilities with potential future products may generate more useful information than a product with greater overlap. ∗We are grateful to Birger Wernerfelt, Juanjuan Zhang and seminar participants at Cambridge University, Chapman University, the Marketing Science Conference, the Utah PSI Conference, the Marketing Dynamics Conference, and the Strategic Management Society Conference for helpful comments. †Simon Business School, University of Rochester; e-mail: jeanine.miklosthal@simon.rochester.edu. ‡Simon Business School, University of Rochester; e-mail: raith@simon.rochester.edu. §Argyros School of Business and Economics, Chapman University; e-mail: selove@chapman.edu.	email;marketing science;mathematical model;strategic management	Jeanine Miklós-Thal;Michael Raith;Matthew Selove	2018	Marketing Science	10.1287/mksc.2017.1068	minimum viable product;product proliferation;knowledge management;operations management;business;new product development;commerce;product engineering	DB	-64.74428464619628	0.6934834671971719	129893

This paper seeks to identify the critical infrastructure sectors of a country, namely India, and to explore the dependencies existing among them. The research draws on the extant literature as well as expert opinion and judgments to identify the critical infrastructure sectors. Following this, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique is employed to discover the relationships and dependencies existing among the identified critical infrastructure sectors. Next, cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) analysis is used to categorize the critical infrastructure sectors into four subgroups based on their driving power and dependence on other sectors. Policy implications for government entities and businesses in India are also discussed. & 2014 Elsevier B.V.

2db715fbcfe54d195672f97e6839d009a229478a	workshop on open information infrastructures enabling innovations		Information infrastructures and the large amounts of data that are accessible through them offer tremendous potential for innovation. In this workshop, we present and discuss two examples of such high-impact innovations: an open data e-infrastructure and government re-use of a business information infrastructure. Both offer possibilities for innovations in the public sector. The workshop covers both the infrastructures themselves and their challenges. Information infrastructures are open, heterogeneous, evolving and IT facilitated sociotechnical systems that are shared between multiple actors [HL10]. They include the information technology (IT) and organisational structures and networks, and the facilities and services based thereon that actors, society and economies need in order to function [TLS10]. These information infrastructures impact and even reshape the organisations and their services, also in the public sector [JCG09]. Information infrastructures and the large amounts of data that are accessible through them offer tremendous potential for innovation in the publicsector. This workshop covers the impact of open information infrastructures on enabling innovations. It does so by discussing practical implementations and innovation projects, and the consequences thereof for government organisations and their relationships with citizens and businesses. Through sharing knowledge and experiences gained from multiple perspectives and backgrounds, the workshop aims to both widen and deepen the understanding of the participants on the opportunities and challenges of open information infrastructures as an enabler for innovations of the public sector.

The recognition of sustainability has faced dramatic alterations with new aspects in recent decades, various methodologies, tools, organizations, and initiatives emerged in order to catch the change and take steps toward a sustainable future. However, the world-wide pervasive environmental degradation and rising social equity problems reveal clearly that these efforts lack the sufficient power to stimulate the social, economic, and political commitment.  This study proposes a methodological tool for constructing a network which provides coordination and increased strength among the agents of sustainable development. With a focus on design-related research and education, academic institutions are suggested as the operators that host and catalyze the interaction between the various layers of producers and consumers. In other words, the main purpose of this study can be seen as the integration and collaboration of the academic, industrial, and user channels which perform innovative design responses as well as generating social conventions.  Embracing the mindset of Soft Systems Methods (SSMs), the paper establishes a theoretical structure adapted from the front-end innovation model 'New Concept Development (NCD)' and the societal repertoire of co-design.	elegant degradation;network computing devices;pervasive informatics;resonance;soft systems methodology	Fahrettin Ersin Alaca	2011		10.1145/2347504.2347548	psychology;co-design;design thinking;engineering;environmental resource management;marketing;operations management;front and back ends;environmental degradation;management science;sociology;management;sustainability;sustainable development;mechanical engineering	HCI	-71.69675661184647	-3.624235652241102	131505

Findings indicate increased scientific output of ASEAN countries in plant biotechnology as well as increased research collaborations by individual member states and with international partners throughout the 10-year period. The nature of collaboration by ASEAN is linked with the status of economic development of each country. Domestic and international collaborations are strong and are increasing through the years, regional collaboration on the other hand is found to be limited. This limited regional partnership can be a concern for the region's goal of economic integration. Further studies using bibliometric data analysis is suggested for policy diagnosis in plant biotechnology cooperation, knowledge flows, and effect of plant biotechnology research in economic development between ASEAN countries.	bibliometrics	Jane G.

58358374eba92208477aab3658984436cab6b4ed	collaboration between cognitive science and business management to benefit the government sector		Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary science which studies the human dimension, drawing from academic disciplines such as psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and computer modeling. Business management is controlling, leading, monitoring, organizing, and planning critical information to bring useful resources and capabilities to a viable market. Finally, the government sector has many roles, but one primary goal is to bring innovative solutions to maintain and enhance national security. There currently is a gap in the government sector between applied research and solutions applicable to the national security field. This is a deep problem since a critical element to many national security issues is the human dimension and requires cognitive science approaches. One major cause to this gap is the separation between business management and cognitive science: scientific research is either not being tailored to the mission need or deployed at a time when it can best be absorbed by national security concerns. This paper addresses three major themes: (1) how cognitive science and business management benefits the government sector, (2) the current gaps that exist between cognitive science and business management, and (3) how cognitive science and business management may work to address government sector, national security needs.	cognitive science	Glory Emmanuel Aviña	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-39399-5_13	public relations;knowledge management;public sector;business	HCI	-75.92339407091183	-4.259339010494248	131913

Even as new research topics emerge in tandem with the latest developments in technology, the core issue of how to develop systems to leverage these new technologies and topics remains as problematic as ever. Looking at electronic commerce, one of the most recent areas to have stimulated much research interest, we can see that the work in this area is characterized initially by research that considers the basic functionality of these systems: what can they do? Then the focus moves to how to manage them: how can they be used to support organizational strategy? However, a fundamental principle—which may seem obvious, but is nevertheless not always stated—is that all of these systems have to be developed, and that someone must assume responsibility for doing that. Another fundamental principle is that identifying the purpose, functions, and structure of these systems is an extremely complex process.	information system	Nancy L.

While healthcare organizations find implementing “good industry practice” difficult enough to accomplish, other issues such as the safe patching of security vulnerabilities in the software of biomedical devices, safely sharing information across enterprise boundaries, organizing information security programs in competition with other organizational missions, and managing risk in networked environments loom large and often unnoticed, especially for networks of hospitals seeking to manage information resources as an enterprise.	data security;health insurance portability and accountability act	Jeffery Collmann;D.

8efab6ed7e4f6c2814f886cfe17a99cdff1386f0	simulating entrepreneurial strategies in a global knowledge economy		"""In seeking to better understand strategic entrepreneurship in the 21 st Century, this paper develops an agent-based simulation model that allows researchers to study different opportunity recognition strategies in a globalized knowledge economy. The simulation takes account of international knowledge spillovers and shows the comparative payoffs of each entrepreneurial strategy, with distinctive knowledge progression and financial performance profiles. In addition, the societal level effects that arise from competitive agent behavior can be analyzed. INTRODUCTION Looking at the literature on opportunity recognition, one can easily get the impression that we are dealing with only one player: that classical hero of entrepreneurship – the innovator that single-handedly conceives and develops an entrepreneurial enterprise. However, Ihrig (2010) argues that there are also other valuable strategies for recognizing and realizing opportunities, especially those that involve imitative behavior. He introduces a framework that distinguishes between four distinct entrepreneurial strategies: innovating, inventing, imitating, and copying. He goes on to describe an agent-based simulation that models those strategies, enabling researchers to study their associated financial payoffs and their knowledge creation potentials under different environmental conditions. As Ihrig and zu Knyphausen-Aufseß (2009) point out, it is important to analyze the opportunity recognition process in an international context. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to extend Ihrig """" s (2010) simulation model, which places its entrepreneurs in a single """" national """" economy, and to develop a model that takes account of the global knowledge economy and international knowledge spillovers. For this, we first briefly review Ihrig """" s (2010) framework and describe his original simulation model. We then present the model extensions that help implement the international dimension and show results of virtual experiments that highlight the distinct modeling capabilities of the simulation."""	agent-based model;agent-based social simulation;color gradient;email;experiment	Martin Ihrig	2011		10.7148/2011-0068-0076	knowledge economy;knowledge management;management science;business;economic system	AI	-75.07837400887797	0.46315514969713095	132278

In this aspects one of possible solution is divide information between a group of persons authorized to manage this information. Information sharing processes allow to protect the information from disclosure. In this paper, the process of division of the information has been enhanced by biometric identification stage. Secure information processes with biometric identification are used to manage very important and strategic data. This paper presents the questions of personal cryptography understood as a combination of the tasks of classifying information and biometric techniques used for this kind of tasks. The techniques of biometric data marking are present on the examples of data division and sharing protocols, expanded by the stages of personal identification and verification. This kind of solutions is presented for the tasks of dividing appropriately the shared secret information. Moreover, we shall present the management process of shadow sets, i.e., of parts of the divided, secret information. The processes of secret data management are refer to tasks of cognitive management, understood as management executed on the basis of understanding the meaning of the processed data.

e0f4d211885689c8d520fc051673ec89b86f39bc	designing portals for knowledge work		An increasing share of work in businesses and organizations depends on information and knowledge rather than manual labor and physical goods (Wolf, 2005). Knowledge work contributes substantially to the long-term success of an organization. It is characterized by unstructured, creative, and learning-oriented tasks and involves access to a wide variety of structured and unstructured data sources such as Web sites, databases, data warehouses, document bases, or messaging systems. Knowledge work is often hampered by the fragmentation of resources across these numerous elements of information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures. Consequently, concepts for the design and implementation of integrating technologies are required in order to improve ICT support for knowledge work. Originally, the term “portal” has been coined to denote the organized access to Internet resources by search engines and a categorized collections of links (Smith, 2004, p. 93). The metaphor has been extended to integrated access to data sources and applications or, in more recent terminology, contents, and services within businesses and organizations called enterprise (information) portal. Recently, emphasis seems to shift toward semantic integration of data and knowledge sources, services, persons, and processes referred to as knowledge portals (Collins, 2003; Firestone, 2003, p. 30ff; Hädrich & Priebe, 2005; Sandkuhl, 2005; Schwabe & Salim, 2002). This article reflects the ambitious goals and challenges of knowledge portals and proposes the concept of knowledge work situations for the design of knowledge portals.

Without the latter, no system can be commercially viable, nor will the DBS industry thrive. This paper discusses the kind of programming planned for one of the subscription DBS systems, the sources of that programming, and the contemporary contractual and operational practices in the TV programming field.	direct-broadcast satellite	Richard Galkin	1985	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.1985.1146173	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;communications satellite	Vision	-72.64659271048666	-4.4526705009876295	132714

659c0280d9a034868015f706eab2cde290fd2adf	big data: the structure and value of big data analytics		The term Big Data is intuitively appealing and increasingly well accepted in academics as well as practices. Firms readily see the possibility of new business value from big data and future business opportunities. Although they are good understanding what Big Data captures that conventional data do not, the journey for Big Data is difficult and deeply frustrating, as widely known, because of its volume, variety, and velocity. They also get stuck how to collect and analyze Big Data because how-to advice is scarce on this subject and mostly aimed at experts. As a result, Big Data Analytics are considered difficult to implement. The paper discusses that big data have business value and develop a model for measuring its value. We also attempt to design an implementing framework for big data collection as the first step for big data analytics. This paper can contribute to provide a guideline for studying big data analytics.		Hak Kim	2015			analytics	ML	-75.4888619784871	-0.18763682203109153	133021

The automated method enables an auditor to map out a body of authorizations and X-ray it on SoD. The body of authorizations is shaped by the so-called enterprise value cycle, or supercycle. The method supports an integral, top–down, diagram-based approach, including all automated and non-automated parts of an enterprise. Input is an enterprise supercycle diagram with authorizations and abilities. Output is an overview of all potential single-employee fraud constructs, also called potential solo-frauds, that are able to undetectably subtract value from the enterprise. As remediation the automated method indicates which authorization restrictions are minimally required to create a SoD in which solo-fraud is impossible. This paper is the first publication of this method in the international scientific Accounting and Auditing community.	separation of duties;solo	Keith Matcham	2008	Int. J. Accounting Inf.

An analysis of technical guidance for cybersecurity of ISO 80001-2-8 is presented.ISO 80001-2-8 technical security controls have significant gaps in areas.ISO 80001-2-8 presents an effective baseline for cybersecurity of medical devices. Medical devices, in the case of malfunction, can have tangible impact on patient safety. Their security, in a world where the Internet of Things has become a reality, is paramount to the continued safety of patients that are dependent upon these devices. The international standard ISO/IEC 80001 Application of risk management for IT-networks incorporating medical devices presents a unified and amalgamated approach to the safety of medical devices connected to IT networks. Whilst this standard presents a guide for security and risk management in health delivery organisations, its effectiveness with regard to contemporary cybersecurity is unknown.This research employed a structured review process to compare and analyse the ISO/IEC 80001 technical controls standards (ISO/IEC 80001-2-2 and ISO/IEC 80001-2-8), with contemporary cybersecurity best practice, guidelines and standards. The research deconstructed the technical controls and drew links between these standards and cybersecurity best practice to assess the level of harmonisation. Subsequently, a deeper analysis identified the areas of omission, coverage, addition or improvement that may impact the effectiveness of ISO/IEC 80001 to provide effective cybersecurity protection.ISO/IEC 80001 aims to provide a minimal level of cybersecurity however this research demonstrates that there are deficiencies in the standard and identifies the important aspects of cybersecurity that could be improved. This situation has arisen due to the rapidly evolving nature of the cybersecurity environment and the protracted time to revise and republish international standards. This research identified several areas that require urgent consideration, including Emergency Access, Health Data De-Identification, Physical Locks on Devices, Data Backup, Disaster Recovery, Third-Party Components in Product Lifecycle Roadmap, Transmission Confidentiality, and Transmission Integrity. The research will provide health delivery organisations implementing ISO/IEC 80001, assurance as to the level of protection supplied by the ISO/IEC 80001 standard, and the areas that may need enhancement to increase cybersecurity protection and consequently increase in patient safety. Further, the outcomes are expected to influence development of the related international standard, as the findings from this research are being provided to the International Organisations for Standardisation, TC215 Health Informatics, Joint Working Group 7, to inform the review of ISO/IEC 80001 currently in progress.	computer security;cyber security standards	Scott Anderson;Trish Williams	2018	Computer Standards & Interfaces	10.1016/j.csi.2017.10.001	information security;computer science;standard of good practice;risk management;information technology infrastructure library;security controls;itil security management;patient safety;information security management system;computer security	HCI	-71.7030281368232	-6.474672710387287	133784

We’re now building systems with hundreds of millions of users, who belong to millions of firms and dozens of countries; the firms can be competitors and the countries might even be at war. Rather than having a central planner, we have to arrange things so that the desired behaviour emerges as a result of the self-interested action of many uncoordinated principals. Mechanism design and game theory are becoming as important to the system engineer as more conventional knowledge such as data structures and algorithms. This holds not just for systems no-one really controls, such as the Internet; it extends through systems controlled by small groups of firms, such as the future smart grid, to systems controlled by a single firm, such as Facebook. Once you have hundreds of millions of users, you have to set rules rather than micromanage outcomes. Other social sciences have a role to play too, especially the behavioural sciences; HCI testing has to be supplemented by a more principled understanding of psychology. And as software comes to pervade just about every aspect of society, software engineers cannot avoid engaging with policy. This has significant implications for academics: for how we educate our students, and for choosing research topics that are most likely to have some impact. D. Giannakopoulou and F.

Therefore, there occurs a concept “information economy”, designating economic activity, based on application of information and communication technologies. One of the leaders on investment into information technologies is financial institutions, which strongly take the second place after IT companies. One of the areas of information and communication technologies application are remote banking systems. In the paper, the classification of bank plastic cards is considered. The method for assessing the effectiveness of using smart bank cards, based on comparing the expenses on introducing and using bank chip cards and reducing the volume of stolen funds from bank cards, was proposed. On the basis of the offered methodology, the economic efficiency of the application of bank smart cards was calculated using the example of PJSC “SBERBANK”, which is one of the banking sector leaders.	microprocessor;smart card	Alexey V.

However, so far it has received rather little attention by information systems research. Therefore, we design an Analytics Platform for Professional Sports Teams. We introduce Sports Analytics as an interdisciplinary research field and establish a design science research project. As part of this project, we first explore three professional sports teams and theorize meta-requirements for our platform. Second, we propose design principles that indicate how the proposed meta-requirements may be addressed. Third, we develop a prototypical web application that indicates how the proposed design principles may be instantiated. Finally, we evaluate the application with two professional sports teams and a global software vendor. As part of this evaluation, we focus on relevance and feasibility of the proposed Analytics Platform for Professional Sports Teams. We conclude this article by discussing its implications.

By citing international experiences (The Taxation System in Europe Union) and the Solid Waste Association of North America as case studies. The most important findings were firstly that the public sector has to gather complex information through using technological equipments and software. Secondly, public sector organizations can build their own web applications. And finally, Web applications provide a significant help to the decision maker, and enable to exchange information with other governments.	web application	Mohamad Al-Jedaiah;Shadi R. Masadeh;Aymen M.

Neither e-government nor electronic data processing performs the integrated handling of both types of documents. By contrast, document logistics, as a cross-sectional concept, covers the entire flow of documents, from the source to the recipient, regardless of whether they are digital or paper based. The aim of this paper is, first, to investigate the present state of document logistics in the public sector and, second, to identify current needs and potential trends for the near future by using a quantitative prestudy. Following this, a qualitative approach is chosen to further examine the findings of the prestudy and to gain greater insight by conducting a case study with the administration of the federal state of Bremen, Germany.	logistics	Lars Eiermann;Stefan Walter	2010	IJNVO	10.1504/IJNVO.2010.031220	information and communications technology;data processing;computer science;marketing;operations management;knowledge engineering;advertising;management;law;information technology;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-71.31611573167893	2.1457661455592922	135549

Unsustainable tourism development caused problems such as loss of natural resources, conflicts between tourists and local residents, and so on. This research intends to understand the development process of Recreational Business Districts (RBDs) in tourism areas and to provide a framework for supporting sustainable tourism development by analyzing interactions between tourists and RBD. An Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) combined with Geographic Information System (GIS) provides planning supports to tourism bureaus and policy makers to help them assess possible future development plans in tourism under certain scenarios.	simulation	Dingding Chao;Kazuo Furuta;Taro Kanno	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-25655-4_23	tourism geography;environmental planning;geography;environmental resource management;ecotourism;economic growth	Robotics	-68.16171722361585	-1.1369588602649785	135652

The workshop was initiated to exchange the possibilities to proceed in the area of assessing errors of commission, those interventions of operators that are not required from the system point of view and aggravate the scenario evolution. A common sense in the research on errors of commission is that the respective HRA methods require a more profound database than the classical HRA methods. This paper summarizes the discussion of the workshop. It discusses the various data sources and their use in HRA, the problems that make it difficult to get appropriate data for HRA, and possible approaches to overcome this bottleneck in HRA. q 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

It aims at augmenting the quality of decisionmaking and of corporate governance taking inter-organizational knowledge into account. The rationale behind the proposal is that CNOs are still lacking research and work for enhancing their agility where rapid decision-making is crucial for achieving their goals. In this paper knowledge management is proposed as an approach for tackling this problem. The paper presents the first step for a framework for gathering information and for generating new knowledge dynamically according to what users need for given situations. The corporate knowledge is retained, organized, shared and re-used to the benefit of individuals and of CNO as well as of their respective members.	corporate governance;design rationale;knowledge management;network-centric organization	Leandro Loss;Alexandra A.

However, this knowledge is often not optimally used or even visible and available for employees and management within companies. This intangible knowledge leads to continuously reinvented wheels within organisations and employees misspend time learning processes in a cumbersome way on their own. To overcome this problem, we present a new approach aimed at connecting employees socially. The main novelty is the use of the organisation's business processes as basis for connecting employees by indicating their process-related areas of expertise. The goal is to enable enduring sharing and distribution of knowledge within an organisation to support decision making in process execution. Our evaluation results from two financial services companies show that employees perceive such a network as very helpful. Our approach leads to easier access, better search results and more opportunities to connect knowledge with other employees. Display Omitted Knowledge in organisations is often not available for decision makers.We present a process-based knowledge map to connect employees socially.The acceptance is achieved by not explicating tacit knowledge.Decision making in process execution is supported by co-workers.An evaluation in two financial service companies demonstrates acceptance.	knowledge management	Michael Leyer;Christian Schneider;Nina Claus	2016	Decision Support Systems	10.1016/j.dss.2016.05.003	public relations;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;management science;business process;management;information system;business-to-employee	AI	-77.0373840869926	3.867609999566089	136222

The research is a still on-going exploratory analysis of so-far under-researched upstream transparency deficiencies. Recent transparency scandals in the US and Canada demonstrate access provisions need to be complemented with rules, regulations and cultures linked to the entire documentary process; from creation to access. The cases selected reveal challenges linked to digital communication and information, thus pointing to a lack of culture, regulation or simply uncertainty in light of public administration's increased use of ICT tools.

100f42a6d610ff75e08f4cb8f7b87622746c485f	centralized versus decentralized computing: organizational considerations and management options	computer information systems	The long.standing debate over whether to centralize or decentralize computing is examined in terms of the fundamental organizational and economic factors at stake. The traditional debate is evaluated, and found to focus predominantly on issues of efficiency versus effectiveness, with solutions based on a rationalistic strategy of optimizing in this trade-off. A behavioral assessment suggests that the driving issues in the debate are the politics of organization and resources, centering on the issue of control. The economics of computing depolyment decisions are presented as an important issue, but one that often serves as a field of argument in which political concerns are dealt with. The debate in this light appears to be unresolvable in the long run, although effective strategies can be developed when the larger issues are recognized. The current situation facing managers of computing, given the advent of small and comparatively inexpensive computers, is examined in detail, and a set of management options for dealing with this persistent issue is presented.	centralisation;centralized computing;computer;decentralized computing	John Leslie King	1983	ACM Comput.

Competitiveness of higher education institutions is closely related to the development of information technologies, as key factor for future European citizens, to beneficiate from The European Higher Education Area and the collaboration in education. Data mining thus appears as one of the opportunities that have been less exploited, but whose application increases steadily, to solve various problems by analyzing data already present in the databases of various institutions. One of the viable solutions to support decision makers may possibly be the decisions support systems (DSS) which integrate specific tools to assist decision together with those of general use to form a constituent part of the institutions’ information system. In this paper the authors present the design of a DSS which integrates data mining technologies, with the purpose to assist the managers of higher education institutions in quality decision-making processes.	data mining;database;decision support system;information systems;management information system	Vasile Paul Bresfelean;Nicolae Ghisoiu;Ramona Lacurezeanu;Mirela Pop;Miranda Vlad;Ovidiu Veres	2009			computer science;knowledge management;higher education;pedagogy	HCI	-73.41289052188728	-5.2186874036191515	137554

From the outset of this, we are interested in how local, regional, and national organizers maneuver to standardize while applying OpenEHR technology.	clinical use template;epr paradox;unfolding (dsp implementation);emotional dependency	Rune Aakvik Pedersen;Gro-Hilde Ulriksen;Gunnar Ellingsen	2015	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-574-6-166	contextualization;data mining;knowledge management;standardization;archetype;openehr;information and communications technology;medicine;corporate governance	HCI	-74.56651948021559	-5.6806574294883285	137705
adc400ff6001f43b7c09dc4e080161c2943b30ee	towards an integrated and inclusive platform for open innovation in the public sector		The growing adoption of the open innovation paradigm in the public sector poses a set of research challenges related to the particularities of the domain and the technologies required to manage the associated knowledge flows among diverse types of stakeholders. This paper aims to shed light on how the proper combination of existing ICT tools can support and advance the implementation of open innovation practices in the public sector. Towards this aim, it first presents a non-exhaustive taxonomy of these tools, which is also associated with the open innovation phase they primarily support. Paying particular attention to the issues of collaboration support and sophisticated data collection and analysis, the paper also proposes an open, inclusive and sustainable web-based platform that builds on the synergy between human and machine intelligence to address the important challenges of public sector open innovation. An indicative application scenario, concerning a contemporary societal problem, showcases the potential of the proposed solution.	open innovation	Aggeliki Androutsopoulou;Nikos I.

Over several decades information security has evolved from early work such as the Bell La Padula (BLP) model toward widely disseminated Information Security Guidelines containing comprehensive and detailed advice. The overwhelming volume and level-of-detail provided often fails to address the information security requirements of SMEs. SMEs typically fail to implement effective Internet strategies due to lack of information security awareness, lack of technical skills and inadequate financial resources. Awareness of information security issues among SMEs is poor. The European Union supported ISA-EUNET Consortium has developed a set of best practices to support SMEs. We present a sample mapping of the Computer Security Expert Assist Team (CSEAT) Information Security Review Areas onto the Alliance for Electronic Business (AEB) web security guidelines as an example of a possible roadmap approach for SMEs to gain information security awareness.	analog expansion bus;best practice;computer security;consortium;electronic business;information security awareness;internet security;level of detail;requirement	David Chapman;Leonid Smalov	2004			knowledge management;standard of good practice;information security audit;information security;certified information security manager;computer science;information security management;computer security;certified information systems security professional;security convergence;commerce;security information and event management	Security	-71.72184784178584	-6.588370179494754	137785

'Soft' factors and KISA related to the development of organisation and human resources have to be carefully dealt with when developing IS-ICT companies. These issues are explored by presenting two cases taken from the IS banking sector. One describes how a deep change in the performance appraisal of employees helped a supplier of outsourced ICT services develop its outsourcing philosophy and market. The other case concerns the design and implementation of the Competence Centre of the Finance Division of a large Italian software company. The discussion shows how IS-ICT suppliers, sensitive to the 'soft' aspects in their businesses, who choose 'loosely structured' and 'relation intensive' organisational solutions, seem to serve their clients more effectively.

This current trend has taken shape and has taken its place in the current economic environment. Despite this, in view of the absence of regulatory and legal regulation, basic concepts, methods of evaluation, management and optimization of crypto-economics processes have not yet been formulated. The present study is devoted to the pricing of ICO as a source of financing for the activities of enterprises that are used practically in all sectors of the economy.	embedded system;ico;mathematical optimization;value (ethics)	Daniel S.

It points to some gaps in the current body of knowledge about KM, and provides a parsimonious set of ‘partitions’ that link to and from traditional knowledge management research and practice. It proposes that attention be paid to knowledge mobilization that reflects the demand side that is dominated by knowledge being part of individual identity and hence personal choice of whether, where, why and with whom to share knowledge and expertise as oppose to just understanding the traditional knowledge management that addresses only the supply side of information and the creation of environments for communication and collaboration, especially those “knowledge” largely being independent of the individual.	autonomous robot;consciousness;data mart;definition;discretionary access control;dreams;gaussian blur;knowledge management;learning organization;logistics;occam's razor;public-key cryptography;relevance;semiconductor industry;strategic management;theme (computing);thought leader;uninterruptible power supply;write-ahead logging	Peter Keen;Margaret Tan	2007	IJKM	10.4018/IJKM.2007100101	kilometer;information exchange;knowledge integration;computer science;knowledge management;data mining;management science	Web+IR	-72.36040145647205	-1.2479238496540237	138866

At the same time, Chinese government debt risk problem has emerged. How to manage the risk of local government debt exposure has been a major challenge to local government. This paper carried on research about the local government debt risk pre-warning problem to find out a more accurate index that can reflect the local government debt risk, and aimed to establish a system model that can properly evaluate and warn the Chinese local government risk. The study adapts the Chinese present financial system reforms, and will have great theoretical significance and practical value.	loose coupling	Xianquan Wang;Qinliang Fan	2012	JCP	10.4304/jcp.7.4.851-857	debt-to-gdp ratio;external debt;actuarial science;public finance;government revenue;internal debt;warning system;debt levels and flows	AI	-75.68518005950862	-8.502779066212927	138886

Agencies across Oregon have begun evaluating and testing NASA Word Wind (WW) JAVA SDK as enabling technology for vertical and horizontal data sharing at the local level (complex public works infrastructure with private engineering firms), data sharing at the regional level (county-wide address information, cadastral information, land use information, and political boundaries), data sharing at the state level (state-wide elevation information and hydro systems) and data sharing with federal agencies. Specific business areas include managing local electronic assets (facilities inventories), coordinating data flows between regional consortia that manage the regional land information systems, and serving large dynamic remote sensing data sets such as climate, imagery and elevation (LiDAR). The State's Elevation Framework Implementation Team, the Pacific Northwest Hydro Community, the City of Springfield and many others from government, education, federated tribes and the private sector are evaluating new methods to overcome age-old problems regarding NSDI implementation. The presentation will focus on challenges, user needs and key advances under investigation with empowering OSS such as WW. In short, this talk will be needs based and WW centric -- rich with the nuances of local SDI.	data infrastructure;inventory;land information system;open sound system;software development kit;dialog	Brandt Melick	2011		10.1145/1999320.1999363	geography;data mining;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-63.70179263673017	-5.116152066710068	138909

This paper examines definitions of service and service system that could frame or otherwise influence future developments in service science and could have implications for what should and should not be included within service science. It argues that the initial development of service science should use straightforward definitions that are understandable, useful, broadly applicable, and teachable. It proposes a definition of service system that is different from the definition proposed in this book’s Call for Chapters and in the 2008 White Paper produced by a service innovation symposium attended by many leaders in the effort to create service science. In comparison with that definition, this paper’s alternative definition is more understandable, useful, broadly applicable, and teachable.		Steven L.

From personal finance to managing defense capabilities to controlling a vast web of aircraft traffic, digitized information systems and software packages have become integrated at virtually all levels of individual and collective activity. While such integration has been met with immense increases in efficiency of service delivery, it has also been subject to a diverse body of threats from nefarious hackers, groups, and even state government bodies. Such cyber threats have shifted over time to affect various cyber functionalities, such as with Direct Denial of Service (DDoS), data theft, changes to data code, infection via computer virus, and many others.	computer virus;cyber resilience;data theft;denial-of-service attack;itil;information system	Igor Linkov;Alexander Kott	2018	CoRR		data theft;computer virus;service delivery framework;hacker;computer security;information system;government;computer science;software;denial-of-service attack	Security	-71.66449998698478	-8.078133227282695	139300

One of these challenges is to be able to determine the optimal mix of subjects from the various disciplines that best meets the objective of developing the requisite professional competencies of knowledge professional. A two-pronged methodology was adopted for this study comprising a survey research to gather perceptions on KM and KM education as well as an investigation of relevant web sites on the Internet for existing postgraduate programs. The latter was used to support a comparative review of the courses' objectives and curriculum, where available. The study established that the adoption of KM in Singapore was most significant in large organizations and the public sector. However, there were differing perceptions as to who in an organization should be responsible for KM and what full-time KM roles should be in-scaled. Nonetheless, the findings did suggest that there is a potential market for knowledge professionals and reinforced the fact that KM is indeed interdisciplinary and drew upon the theories and practices of a number of disciplines such as information technology, information science, communication, business, and management.	knowledge management	Cher Loon Lau;Suliman Al-Hawamdeh	2002	JIKM	10.1142/S021964920200042X	information science;computer science;knowledge management;management science;personal knowledge management;management;information technology;technology	HCI	-77.00187411456328	-8.120259690619733	139455

Portals for releasing open data have been developed, hackatons organized, apps are increasingly being developed and many practices have become available. Yet the practices are diverse and there is hardly any overview of generic methods, principles and practices for the opening and use of open data. This workshop aims at bringing together various stakeholders in the field of open data to discuss the uptake and utilization of open data. The fragmented landscape will be brought together and practices will be presented and shared. In particular, the problems of scaling up publishing and usage of open data will be tackled.	fragmented object;image scaling;portals	Adegboyega K.

The research aims to specify any digital marketing skills gaps encountered by professionals working in communication industries. In-depth interviews were undertaken with 20 communication industry professionals. A focus group followed, testing the rigour of the data. We find that a lack of specific technical skills; a need for best practice guidance on evaluation metrics, and a lack of intelligent futureproofing for dynamic technological change and development are skills gaps currently challenging the communication industry. However, the challenge of integrating digital marketing approaches with established marketing practice emerges as the key skills gap. Emerging from the key findings, a Digital Marketer Model was developed, highlighting the key competencies and skills needed by an excellent digital marketer. The research concludes that guidance on best practice, focusing upon evaluation metrics, futureproofing and strategic integration, needs to be developed for the communication industry.

Besides the changes in the social dialectic, the concept and conduct of war fighting have also changed. Information as a resource has now become a strategic weapon. Information dominance has now become the principle goal of war fighting. However technological capabilities and societal dependence on IT of developed nations is vastly superior to those of the developing countries. Here in lies the need for identifying the developing countries’ perspective on information warfare (IW) and to look into an emerging paradigm. An attempt has been made to figure out a road map for developing countries to gain sufficient defensive and offensive capabilities. The study was carried out in three phases which concluded IW as an effective warfare in technological asymmetric situations and a deterrent in different levels of conflict spectrum.	iw engine;information system;plan;programming paradigm	Zafar Husain;Ashutosh K Pathak;Ramkrishna Vyas	2005	IJITM	10.1504/IJITM.2005.006403	developing country;computer science;engineering;sociology;information management;war;management;operations research;law;information technology;computer security;information system	AI	-73.28641608341776	-7.62414761635213	140734

DBR is applied to develop and evaluate an m-learning environment, Mobile Learning Research (m-LR) delivered by mobile handheld devices. The emergence and evolution of DSR in the information systems discipline and, similarly, DBR in educational technology are overviewed, noting similarities and differences. The development of an m-learning application for a South African tertiary education context, illustrates DBR. The development and research process involved six iterations, comprising four evaluations and two digital profile studies. The study reflects on the nature and extent of the conformance of m-LR to the features and tenets of DBR. In line with the characteristic dual-outcomes of DBR, the development process not only generated the designed artifact, m-LR, but also produced theoretical contributions.	ansi escape code;conformance testing;distributed bragg reflector;emergence;information system;iteration;lr parser;mobile device	Ruth de Villiers;Patricia Harpur	2013		10.1145/2513456.2513471	simulation;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-76.81324338387626	-2.1168807926813304	140861

A data set of publicly available secondary data sources and grounded theory analysis are used to build a hypothesis (attacker taxonomy) to base the attacker personas on. Benefits of attacker personas, for example raising security awareness, are outlined as well as current drawbacks, like a lack of integration into the wider security management environment. Future research topics such as methodological advancement, stakeholder verification and collaboration are also mentioned.	online banking;process modeling;security awareness;security management;taxonomy (general);user-centered design	Caroline Moeckel	2018		10.1145/3240167.3240241	procedural approach;human–computer interaction;persona;grounded theory;knowledge management;information security;secondary data;stakeholder;security awareness;security management;computer science	Security	-74.55822687187639	-2.6768542624262417	140952
eaedf2e5da409c18d1075429abe24200e7d3ae6e	survey on big data analytics in public sector of russian federation	большие данные	Everyone is talking about big data, and how it will transform government. However, looking past the excitement, questions abound. How to use big data to make intelligent decisions? Perhaps most importantly, what value will it really deliver to the government and the citizenry it serves to? By reviewing the literature and summarizing insights from a series of business reports and interviews of public sector and top companies Chief Information Officers (CIOs), we offer a survey for both practitioners and researchers interested in understanding big data in the public sector of Russian Federation. Remarkable changes are taking place in IT industry of Russian Federation at present: new strategies of Federal Government, sanctions and import substitution tendency. The paper makes the estimate of internal and external factors, which effect on big data development in public sector of Russian Federation and makes comparative analysis of Russian and world practices of the study area. © 2015 The Authors.

Along with recent progress and popularization of Information Technology, social sciences have been experiencing great advances in survey methodology. It has become possible for researchers to utilize huge social data with computers. However, there have been only conceptual studies in business school and few quantitative studies about enterprise organizations. In a survey of an enterprise, we evaluated strategic organization changes with graph/network analysis of the communication network constructed from email transaction data. Moreover, there is strong business needs to know how activities change according to an organization transformation. Utilizing the agent-based approach, we have constructed a dynamic model and simulation of communication over an organization structure. The result of the simulation indicates the power distribution for link degrees which is also observed in the real world as universal characteristics of the scale-free network.	agent-based model;agent-based social simulation;business requirements;computer;dynamic enterprise;email;mathematical model;social network analysis;telecommunications network;transaction data	Hideyuki Mizuta;Fusashi Nakamura	2005	Proceedings of the Winter Simulation Conference, 2005.		enterprise private network;simulation;enterprise systems engineering;enterprise software;network analysis;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;management science;enterprise integration;business communication;information technology;enterprise information system;enterprise life cycle	DB	-76.84514815360946	3.283611712700075	141057

42e6fd0be9c6c34c926a2ababc74b23f60cd3301	machine justice: governing security through the bureaucracy of algorithms		The use of algorithms to predict behaviour is becoming the gold standard in criminal justice in various countries. This article critically analyses the algorithm-driven risk assessment tools used in predictive policing and predictive justice. First, we propose to see algorithms as essentially bureaucratic instruments. They are the digital offspring of the classic bureaucratic procedure, creating classification through standardised and impersonal decision-making. Second, we argue that the application of algorithms in criminal justice expands the bureaucratic field to areas previously understood as bulwarks of professional judgement. Third, we analyse the shift in purpose of algorithmic decision-making: instead of determining a citizenu0027s status of beneficiary or obligate, we now see algorithmic anticipation of behaviour. This shifts the logic of decision-making over investigations, probations, and sentencing from individual judgement to bureaucratic classification based on the algorithms that are designed into risk assessments tools. This article is both a bureaucratic critique of algorithm-driven risk assessment tools in criminal justice and a call to rethink bureaucracy and bureaucratisation beyond the boundaries of public administration.	algorithm;bureaucracy	Rik Peeters;Marc Schuilenburg	2018	Information Polity	10.3233/IP-180074	judgement;bureaucracy;anticipation;predictive policing;risk assessment;algorithm;risk management tools;beneficiary;political science;criminal justice	Crypto	-75.673028448799	-7.3782078417465184	141174
1cfeb6311d5077bb06a67695dc23ffca5f664943	managing complex work systems via crowdworking platforms: how deutsche bank explores ai trends and the future of banking with jovoto		Crowdsourcing has evolved into a powerful new instrument for companies. In the last years, crowdworking platforms that manage work systems as intermediaries between crowdsourcers and crowd workers have increasingly been used. Nevertheless, they currently often manage rather simple work systems. Although they have the potential for managing more complex ones, there is still little knowledge how this can be done and what measures are necessary to do so. To explore this question in more detail, we investigate three seminal projects that Deutsche Bank completed with the crowdworking platform Jovoto and that aimed at exploring AI trends and developing concepts for the future of banking. We derive measures necessary for the successful management of complex work systems and provide a model as guidance for both companies and crowdworking platform operators. With our findings, we extend current knowledge in the realm of IS, organizational theory, and platform ecosystems.	crowdsourcing;ecosystem;work systems	Volkmar Mrass;Christoph Peters;Jan Marco Leimeister	2018			knowledge management;information management;management science;organizational theory;intermediary;work systems;crowdsourcing;engineering	Web+IR	-74.88909443745253	3.1491661722741626	141300

Six case studies of technological learning and links to external sources of know-how from the South of China in the Pearl River Delta are examined. It is shown that the learning process that has been experienced in these enterprises is similar to that of other fast growing East Asian economies. Until now enterprises have been acquiring technology through external linkages with foreign clients that become their main providers of technology. A detailed account of the enterprises allows a typology of the external technological learning. It is claimed that the growth of the South of China lies in this ‘external’ interactive technological learning, as in other East Asian economies.	biological anthropology;foreign function interface	Rigas Arvanitis;Wei Zhao;Haixiong Qiu;Jian-niu Xu	2006	IJTM	10.1504/IJTM.2006.009964	economics;marketing;technology management;management;economic growth;china;economic system;commerce	NLP	-74.81718202065447	1.109362714729263	142546

However, much of what has emerged has been small scale or tool-centric. While these efforts are vitally important to the development of the field, in order to truly transform education, learning analytics must scale and become institutionalized at multiple levels throughout an educational system. Many institutions are currently undertaking this grand challenge and this panel will highlight cases from: the University of Wisconsin System, the Society for Learning Analytics Research, the University of New England, and Rio Salado College.	big data;consortium;donald becker;grand challenges;linear multistep method;namecoin;new media;sas;software deployment;the australian;thomas m. baer;winsock	Kimberly E.

b575e9acaf665f2584ddd7f8d2bf6e4896b626d8	towards a new synthesis of ontology technology and knowledge management	knowledge management;semantic web	This paper provides a synthesis of ontology research and one of its most significant application areas, the business discipline of Knowledge Management (KM for short). Despite that such a synergy is in great demand between consumers and suppliers of ontology technology, there is a lack of understanding on one side and a lack of realism on the other. The lack of communication and understanding between ontology research and applied Knowledge Management holds the danger that mainstream KM will remain neutral to ontologies, while research develops as a largely unguided exploration. We provide an analysis of the state-of-the-art in technologies for Knowledge Management in order to explain the role and potential contribution of ontologies to the development of Knowledge Management. Our main contribution towards a synthesis of Ontology Technology and Knowledge Management is a visual classification framework called the Semantic Web Matrix, which gives an easily understood, businessoriented account of application scenarios for ontology-based Knowledge Management, both centralized and distributed. We conclude our survey by discussing the most significant bottleneck in applying ontologies, namely a lack of understanding regarding the social nature of knowledge and the consequences this has for efforts targeted at the management of distributed knowledge.	centralized computing;knowledge management;ontology (information science);semantic web;synergy	Peter Mika;Hans Akkermans	2004	Knowledge Eng.

bf5da9459eafafe1d5e416b806c2130cd5e98533	universal enterprise integration: challenges of and approaches to web-enabled virtual organizations	enterprise integration;virtual organization	We began the call for papers for this special issue by implying that the foremost challenges to web-enabled virtual organizations were due to the need to spontaneously link different organizations: entities with different worldviews, different cultures, different processes, different descriptions for their processes and different and even divergent goals. Further, we stressed two points. First, this is a previously defined problem, that of the “integration of semantically heterogeneous entities” and much research has been devoted to the problem across many fields over many years. Second, the WWW, with the potential for the linking of constantly evolving global mass of consumers and producers via a common technological infrastructure, has brought new salience and technical difficulties to these time honored (and only partially solved) problems. We find in the papers in this issue that the time-honored approaches to the problem (or conceptual lenses used to view the problem) continue. However the same technological infrastructure that accentuates the semantic heterogeneity issue yields the potential for new solutions. Though the traditional lenses are still in place, the distinctions along all dimensions have blurred. As a brief example, consider that at one time the dimension nexus of control would yield either a clean centralized translation or a many-to-many web model. Now, however, hybrid, models are technologically possible and pragmatically desirable. The classification of solutions is much fuzzier than 15 years ago when the same problems were addressed as “distributed artificial intelligence” or as “office information systems”. In this overview of the special issue we first discuss both the traditional approaches and the new and very interesting hybrid models seen in many of the papers in this issue through a framework with three dimensions. We then briefly review each of the special issue papers with reference to the framework in the hope of making the context, applicability and assumptions of each more quickly evident.	centralized computing;distributed artificial intelligence;enterprise integration;entity;foremost;information system;many-to-many;semantic heterogeneity;virtual organization (grid computing);www	Vijay K.

Based on questionnaires completed by 293 farmer households in 40 villages and towns in 10 counties of Sichuan province and Chongqing municipality, this paper explores farmers' decision-making behaviors with consideration of information cost, by establishing utility functions and Logistic models. The investigation suggests that farmers' willingness to pay is significantly influenced by factors like their education, agricultural acreage, income of agricultural production and operation and their accessibility of information services. Based on this, this paper proposes some strategies, such as improving farmers' ability of searching and using information through various channels and following the path of combining 'public-interset information service' with 'commercial information service'. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

This study systematically reviews past researches of industrial cluster. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of this issue regarding the driving forces for the growth of industrial cluster and find out the priority among these cluster policies. Taiwan HsinChu Science Park is a prime example for this paper, and its connection with the innovative participators. We begin with an examination of the literature on cluster about its driving forces and policies upon which we propose a conceptual framework. In doing so, we explore the cluster-based industrial system. Then this research adopts the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process as the analytical tool. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process method is used to determine the weightings for evaluation dimension among decision makers. From our research results, the Factor Conditions is the most important driving force for advancing the industrial cluster performance. Moreover, the promotion of international linkages policy and broader framework policies rank the first two priorities for cluster policy. Overall, this paper concludes with some simulations of cluster policy alternatives confronting the industry and the Taiwanese government. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It can be embodied in people, products, raw materials, processes; just to name a few knowledge repositories. Knowledge itself cannot be managed, but there are knowledge processes which can be managed. Knowledge can be for example created, acquired, shared, exchanged, transformed and combined. In this course we will go through these processes and many others and discuss what these processes are; what they require from the organization and its members, and how they contribute to the success of the organization and its employers. The students will also familiarize themselves with practical knowledge management tools and techniques. After the course students are expected to understand the complex nature of knowledge in organizations which will enable them to analyze, understand and implement knowledge management practices in organizations.	embodied cognition;information repository;knowledge management	Joline Morrison;Lorne Olfman	1999		10.1109/HICSS.1999.772787	organizational learning;cognition;data management;computer science;knowledge management;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;management science;personal knowledge management;data analysis;information technology;memory management	Web+IR	-76.21881011564982	2.4840525213340197	145539

The resilience of the crude oil pipeline network was analysed using the model-based risk analysis (MBRA) software tool developed by the Naval Post Graduate School Center for Homeland Defense and Security. Results identified five critical hubs, with the most critical hub being the Cushing, OK Trading Hub (COTH). A disruption in operation of the COTH or any of the five critical hubs would have far reaching negative consequences, creating long lasting political, psychological, and economic impacts. Based on the results of this assessment, it is recommended that the critical hubs be considered critical national assets and protected as such.	risk assessment	Patrick K. Smith;John M.

In the face of such scenario the open innovation seems to be an effective strategy to keep enterprises aware of customer needs and also interact with universities which are able to understand the tendencies and holds deep knowledge of innovative subjects. Although open innovation has a rich literature regarding the benefits and cases of success this literature does not focus on how collaboration systems are used to support open innovation. In this article we present the important relation that exists between open innovation and collaborative systems with a case study of Natura Campus program. We evaluated tools which compose the collaboration platform and how it supports Natura Campus Open Innovation. We found that CSCW tools are capable of support open innovation and help to bring effective results in order to enhance competitiveness.	blog;collaborative real-time editor;collaborative software;comparison of project management software;computer-supported cooperative work;email;gamification;microsoft outlook for mac;mobile app;open innovation;social network;theory;wiki	Marcio Geovani Jasinski;Luis Bernardes;Carla Diacui Medeiros Berkenbrock	2014	Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE 18th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD)	10.1109/CSCWD.2014.6846886	knowledge management	Visualization	-75.29443438884869	3.752403927414409	146156

43b0a104b00332d938ffe89885e2e845ab174203	bottom-up imaginaries: the cultural-technical practice of inventing regional advantage through it r&d		Recent HCI research on social creativity and bottom-up innovation has highlighted how concerted efforts by the government policy and business communities to develop innovation ecosystems are increasingly intertwined with IT research and development. We note that many such efforts focus on cultivating regional advantage [20] in the form of innovation hubs that are situated in and leverage distinct sociocultural histories and geographies. Cultivating regional advantage entails achieving broad consensus about what that region's advantage might be, that is, the construction of a regional advantage imaginary beyond the policies, IT supports, and practices to make it happen. Here, we document how an ongoing public debate among makers and manufacturers in Taiwan as a region-distinguished by direct engagement with design, fabrication, prototyping, and manufacturing processes-are proposing pathways toward a regional advantage that both reflects Taiwan's recent sociocultural and economic histories and also its near future aspirations.	bottom-up proteomics;ecology;ecosystem;human–computer interaction;imaginary time;rejection sampling;semiconductor device fabrication;situated;sociotechnical system;top-down and bottom-up design	Guo Freeman;Shaowen Bardzell;Jeffrey Bardzell	2018		10.1145/3173574.3173899	leverage (finance);multimedia;public policy;socioeconomics;situated;public debate;fabrication;sociocultural evolution;computer science;top-down and bottom-up design;creativity	HCI	-72.24971800623375	-3.4855897033059042	147202

It explained the dynamics of the increasingly vital production factor called IT. This theory is probably the most well-known and most widespread framework of the development of information technology in organisations. It provides many insights in the ways in which IT has evolved and continues to evolve. Moreover, it offers both senior (business) management and IT management the possibility of directing this complex phenomenon, without immediately going into technical details. Since 1973, a number of associated articles have been published by Richard L. Nolan and a number of co-authors. The theory has continuously been adapted to the current IT environment and has been applied by a huge number of large companies throughout the world. Proceeds with the development of the stages theory in order to be able to deal with the business and IT issues of the next five to ten years.

In such a condition, underwater pipeline networks would not certainly be adequate. An alternative solution would be the use of large capacity floating reservoir to store the processed oil on board and ship it to shore by smaller shuttle tankers. Thus, some desirable features for the FPSO system include large storage capacity, large deck-areas to accommodate separation plant and good hydrodynamic performance when acted by ocean waves, wind and sea currents. Until very recently, there were worldwide offers of old large tankers approaching life cycle limit. Such a market characteristic helped to increase the number of conversion of old large tankers onto stationary floating production units The declining of that market associated with the fast increasing of the number of FPSO new projects to be installed mostly in the Southeastern Brazilian Coast, the Western Coast of Africa and, more recently due to relaxation in the legislation, in the Gulf of Mexico, has pressed for changes in the way the next generation of FPSO will be planned. It is clear now that most of the new FPSO hulls will need to be designed and built from scrap. On the other hand, the design of a ship-like hull form to work specifically as a stationary unit raises opportunities to improve its operational performance. There is a wide open field for potential innovations to be incorporated into the design of new FPSO hulls to increase their hydrodynamic performance and to achieve higher efficiency and significant savings derived from using less-expensive equipments and possibly increasing operational time. The motivation of this paper is deeply involved in the perspectives mentioned earlier. It discusses results related to a new particular concept for a FPSO hull. The main focus of the discussion points towards the hydrodynamic behaviour of the new hull in waves and tries to identify its potential effects on costs and operational revenue.	enterprise life cycle;graphics pipeline;gulf of evaluation;linear programming relaxation;next-generation network;stationary process	Joel Sena Sales;P.

After a description of the framework for public support of privateinnovation and the tools for selecting innovative public venture capitalprojects, cognitive maps (i.e., graphic representations of individual states ofknowledge in a defined field) are used to uncover ANVAR's project selectionprocesses. Results indicate that that the agency's models of evaluation are differentfor projects related to the two emerging technologies. In other words, projectsrelated to each of the technologies have their own specificity in terms ofcapacity to appropriate rents from innovation, factors limiting profitability,and the nature of risks. These findings offer useful insights for privateventure capital organizations as well as public agencies.

Particularly the coastal zone will feel the consequences of climate change and the associated effects like sea level rise, increased storminess and flooding. Thus there is an urgent need for local and regional spatial planners to include climate change in their planning efforts. Using modelling and simulation, we can increase our understanding of the future land-use system under influence of a changing climate and accordingly reduce uncertainty concerning decisions. The current paper describes how land-use simulations combined with climate change scenarios can facilitate the definition of adaptation strategies to counteract the consequences of potential climate changes.

Based on concepts originally developed in coastal geomorphology and adapted to medical geography, a theory of retail chain expansion and maturity is presented whereby retailers expand in waves with alternating periods of faster and slower growth. Using a space-time matrix of new store openings, four stages are identified: prospective, deploying, saturation, and revisiting. By analyzing the net change from one period to the next at increasing distances from a retailer's original store, the stages can be represented as swash, backwash, and re-swash waves. Target and Walmart adopted dissimilar strategies, with Walmart diffusing gradually from Arkansas and Target growing from the coasts inward. They were similar, however, in that after expanding into an area they reached a point of saturation and opened fewer stores, then moved on to other areas, only to revisit the earlier areas for new store deployment.	capability maturity model	Lawrence Joseph;Michael J.

Generally, the goal is to optimize the selection from a technology viewpoint. These theories do not address all of the human interaction specifics of technology selection. There are additional criteria that are not considered as part of the standard Information Theories of Reasoned Action or Technology Acceptance Model. The proposed Technology Selection Model includes peer and industry evaluations, vendor marketing efforts, Satisficing, organizational fit as well as the typical technical evaluation.

d914be5a7a7764d36fbd5ffb2ebb7eb14428770b	aufbau eines ppgis zur standortplanung von fahrradstationen		Public participation increasingly occurs in the context of modern GIS applications and goes much further than just crowd sourcing. Those web based applications enables the user to be actively involved in urban planning processes. Additionally, planners do profit from the participation of public. By the example of charging station for e-bikes, the participatory planning process is shown in this paper. The application is completely built on open source technologies and free available data. Two user groups are addressed by the application: citizens that would like to add their ideas to an urban planning process, and planners, that would like to identify most ideal locations for e-bike-stations by using GIS-based analysis in combination with additional information.	crowdsourcing;gis applications;open-source software;public participation geographic information system	Karsten Weißmann;Jonas Pieper;Conrad Franke;Jürgen Schweikart	2016	AGIT Journal	10.14627/537622042	cartography;geography;public participation gis	HCI	-68.09102438313404	-4.033730214041466	148863

7ddbdaac93b8f5bac96b9ef426711885b209ba1a	shared mobility systems: an updated survey		Transportation habits have been significantly modified in the past decade by the introduction of shared mobility systems. These have emerged as a partial response to the need of resorting to green means of transportation and to the desire of being more flexible in the choice of trips, both from a spatial and a temporal point of view. On the one hand, shared mobility systems have taken advantage of the interest of riders for shared experiences. On the other hand, their success has been possible as a result of the recent advances in information and communications technology. The operational research community is already very active in this emerging field, which provides a very rich source of new and interesting challenges, covering several planning levels, from strategic to operational ones, such as station location, station sizing, rebalancing routes. A fascinating feature of this field is the variety of the methods used to deal with these questions. Our purpose is to survey the main problems and methods arising in this field.

The attraction of  the ‘virtual’ concept is well documented and numerous examples of its efficacy exist in the literature. Applications of the  concept vary from the complete application of the virtual model to partial solutions to meet a need for specialist process  and capability requirements. This paper identifies some of the issues that will have an impact on planning performance systems.  Clearly the notion of ‘asset leverage’ and ‘zero working capital’ are corporate ideals but before these can be anywhere near  realities some problems must first be resolved.

ADP-managers saw greater promise in the concept of information administration than did information managers. Many informants were concerned that planned information administration could lead to control and restriction of the information flow rather than to a supportive and facilitative approach. Furthermore, most informants reported various deficiencies in current information handling practices. The consequences of the results for improved IT use in organizations are discussed.

With regard to the existence of many approaches to developing Electronic Health Records, the basic question is what kind of Model is suitable for the guarantee of the security of Electronic Health Records? The present study is a descriptive–comparative investigation conducted in Iran in 2007, along with comparisons made Electronic health records information security requirements of Australia, Canada, England and U.S.A with. The research was based on the study of texts such as articles, library’s books and journals and reliable websites from 1992 to 2006. Based on the collected data, a primary Model was designed. The Delphi Technique was offered to evaluate the questionnaire and final Model was designed and proposed. Australia, Canada, England and U.S.A have requirements related to organizing information security, classifying and controlling information asset, security of human resources, environmental and physical security, Operational and communication management security, information access control security and development and Maintenance security of Electronic Health Records information systems. In the U.S.A, the above security requirements are presented in administrative, Physical and Technical safeguards. Based on the research findings, a comprehensive model of electronic health record security requirements in seven pivots is presented for Iran. This model is a collection of EHR security requirements from studied countries. The studied countries are solely subject to part of elements of this model. The suggested model is different from the ones used in other countries in some respects and is recommended for application in Iran.	access control;book;classification;delphi method;description;electronic health records;information systems;information access;information security;information system;journal;organizing (structure);physical security;requirement	Mehrdad Farzandipour;Farahnaz Sadoughi;Maryam Ahmadi;Iraj Karimi	2009	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-009-9276-7	information security audit;computer security model;standard of good practice;certified information security manager;cloud computing security;itil security management;certified information systems security professional;security information and event management;security engineering;delphi method;computer science;information security;comparative research;information security standards;data mining;security service;information technology;world wide web;computer security;information system;information security management	Security	-70.37717079685115	-8.40427503156857	151303
