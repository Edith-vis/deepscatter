It is shown with the method of characteristic functions that the cross-correlation coefficients between the desired user's and the interfering users' spreading sequences tend, in distribution, to independently and identically distributed circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random variables as the processing gain goes to infinity. Based on this Gaussian approximation, the structure of the spatio-temporal matched filter receiver is derived and a bit error rate formula is obtained. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, as well as analytical methods, it is shown that the spatio-temporal matched filter receiver achieves a significant performance improvement over the conventional, temporal, and spatial matched filter receivers by effectively suppressing the multiple access interference.	approximation;bit error rate;coefficient;cross-correlation;interference (communication);matched filter;monte carlo method;process gain;simulation	Joon Ho Cho;James S.

The study is part of a larger project to develop efficient and near-optimal MIMO detection algorithms for high-order symbol constellations. Fouladi Fard's near-optimal detection algorithm differs from the conventional V-BLAST algorithm by considering each possible value of the noisiest symbol in the current symbol vector, and then performing V-BLAST in parallel for each candidate to detect the remaining symbols. We investigated modifications of Fouladi Fard's algorithm that restrict the search space for the first (noisiest) symbol, thereby reducing the computational complexity while still producing performance that significantly exceeds that of V-BLAST.	algorithm;blast;brute-force search;cs-blast;computational complexity theory;mimo;map (parallel pattern);multi-user;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Arsene Pankeu Yomi;Bruce F.

To estimate the high order channel parameters, we develop a layered architecture using dimension-reduced parameter estimation algorithms to estimate the frequency-selective multipath channels. In the proposed architecture, to exploit the space-time geometric characteristics of multipath channels, spatial beamformers and constrained (or unconstrained) temporal filters are adopted for clustered-multipath grouping and path isolation. In conjunction with the multiple access interference (MAI) suppression techniques, the proposed architecture jointly estimates the direction of arrivals, propagation delays, and fading amplitudes of the downlink fading multipaths. With the outputs of the proposed architecture, the signals of interest can then be naturally detected by using path-wise maximum ratio combining. Compared to the traditional techniques, such as the Joint-Angle-and-Delay-Estimation (JADE) algorithm for DOA-delay joint estimation and the space-time minimum mean square error (ST-MMSE) algorithm for signal detection, computer simulations show that the proposed algorithm substantially mitigate the computational complexity at the expense of only slight performance degradation.	algorithm;mimo;telecommunications link	Yung-Yi Wang;Wen-Hsien Fang;Jiunn-Tsair Chen	2009	IEICE Transactions		computer simulation;joint;minimum mean square error;propagation delay;code division multiple access;transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;space time;signal processing;music;direction of arrival;antenna array;fading	Visualization	49.946763562620404	78.36712498596994	51185

In this paper, the layer error characteristics of LRA-V-BLAST detectors are analyzed and compared with those of conventional V-BLAST ones. Two important conclusions are drawn for the LRA-V-BLAST detectors. First, the variation of their mean square error (MSE) within each detection iteration is not as large as in conventional V-BLAST detectors. Second, thanks to lattice reduction there exists an inherent sub-optimal detection order from the last to the first layer. These conclusions allow LRA-V-BLAST detectors to avoid optimal ordering to further reduce the complexity. LRA-V-BLAST detectors without optimal ordering are shown to obtain almost the same BER performance of LRA-V-BLAST detector with optimal ordering	blast;bell laboratories layered space-time;bit error rate;iteration;lattice reduction;mimo;mean squared error;sensor;x.690	Tien Duc Nguyen;Xuan Nam Tran;Tadashi Fujino	2006	2006 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1093/ietfec/e89-a.10.2535	lattice reduction;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics;spatial multiplexing;statistics;mimo	Arch	46.984159760266884	77.38534718651317	51393
b0d2c074da0e02c62faac63d8541957ccd0d7d4b	an enhanced receiver for an impulsive uwb-based plc system for low-bit rate applications		This paper focuses on the convergence speed improvement and the computational complexity reduction during the training phase of a receiver based on reduced rank adaptive filter, which is applied to a power line communication system based on impulsive ultra wideband modulation. In this regard, the use of variable step-size, set-membership, and soft threshold into the training phase of a reduced rank adaptive filter is introduced. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal, performance analyses with measured in-home and outdoor power line channels distorted by additive noise, which are modeled as white Gaussian and impulsive Gaussian, are carried out. Based on the numerical results, we show that the convergence speed can be considerably improved with the proposed enhancement for training this adaptive filter. Regardless the types of adopted additive noises and power line channels, we show that the improved convergence speed results in low bit error rate if the number of training symbol is reduced, which is a severe constraint associated with the coherence time of power line channels. Moreover, we show that the use of epochs during the training phase is convenient to deal with short coherence time. Performance comparisons with other receivers show that the proposal is more effective to deal with the hardness of power line channels. Moreover, computational complexity comparison shows that the proposed improvement demands less computational complexity than its predecessors. Finally, we show that proposal yields a receiver that outperforms the receivers based on matched filter or a combination of matched filter with the median filter, when similar computational complexity applies.	ultra-wideband	Marlon Lucas Gomes Salmento;Eduardo P. de Aguiar;Ândrei Camponogara;Moisés Vidal Ribeiro	2017	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2017.08.003	mathematics;algorithm;mathematical optimization;power-line communication;median filter;computational complexity theory;coherence time;adaptive filter;gaussian;ultra-wideband;matched filter;control theory	Networks	50.24231474098363	75.87138464333033	51578

Moreover, we present an evaluation of the average bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed scheme over time-selective fading channels.	bit error rate;carrier frequency offset;doppler effect;error floor;interference (communication);selectivity (electronic)	Kyung Seung Ahn;Jae-Young Kim;Heung Ki Baik	2005	Proceedings.

It is also known that under some weak conditions, all local minima of CMA are identical to that of a CMA which is constrained in signal subspace. Based on this property, we propose a subspace-constrained CMA that is able to increase the convergence rate of the conventional SGD-CMA. To reduce the computational complexity, a technique referred to as projection approximate subspace tracking with deflation (PASTd) is used to calculate the signal subspace. Our simulation shows that the proposed algorithm is significantly superior to the conventional SGD-CMA both in the convergence rate and in the sensitivity to the step size.	approximation algorithm;cma-es;computational complexity theory;maxima and minima;modulus of continuity;rate of convergence;signal subspace;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;stochastic gradient descent	Yu X.

Several linear power allocation strategies combined with single-user equalization schemes are compared with a joint pre-filtering with an equal power constraint at the base station and maximal ratio combining at the mobile terminals. Our bit error rate analysis obtained in this paper facilitates predicting the performance of various space-frequency pre-filtering schemes without massive simulations.

The performance of the system is evaluated in terms of user capacity. In order to incorporate traffic with a wide range of source rates, line rates (adjusted data rates before spreading) have to be selected for transmission. For traffic with source rates higher than the line rate of concern, we propose the use of concatenated orthogonal/PN spreading sequences to subdivide a high rate stream into parallel line rate streams. Therefore, in this paper, we first analyze the properties of the concatenated orthogonal/PN spreading sequences. The results are used to evaluate their performance for homogenous voice traffic in various cellular mobile environments with multipath fading, lognormal shadowing, and path loss. Our results show that the proposed spreading scheme offers a significant improvement in the forward link capacity as compared to using the conventional nonconcatenated long PN sequence, especially if the multipath fading is Rician (e.g., microcellular and indoor picocellular systems). Incorporating the notion of line rate, we then evaluate the performance of a system with integrated voice and video traffic. Special emphasis is placed on the effect of line rate selection on the overall capacity which leads to the optimal selection of line rates.	concatenation	Mo-Han Fong;Vijay K.

62a38c2639864e294f865f5692a4cb86b0fbc8db	distributed compressed spectrum sensing via cooperative support fusion		Spectrum sensing in wideband cognitive radio (CR) networks faces several significant practical challenges, such as extremely high sampling rates required for wideband processing, impact of frequency-selective wireless fading and shadowing, and limitation in power and computing resources of single cognitive radio. In this paper, a distributed compressed spectrum sensing scheme is proposed to overcome these challenges. To alleviate the sampling bottleneck, compressed sensing mechanism is used at each CR by utilizing the inherent sparsity of the monitored wideband spectrum. Specifically, partially known support (PKS) of the sparse spectrum is incorporated into local reconstruction procedure, which can further reduce the required sampling rate to achieve a given recovery quality or improve the quality given the same sampling rate. To mitigate the impact of fading and shadowing, multiple CRs exploit spatial diversity by exchanging local support information among them. The fused support information is used to guide local reconstruction at individual CRs. In consideration of limited power per CR, local support information percolates over the network via only one-hop local information exchange. Simulation results testify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by comparing with several existing schemes in terms of detection performance, communication load, and computational complexity. Moreover, the impact of system parameters is also investigated through simulations.

We construct an LPTV-based Multiple Access (LPTVMA) system with complex modulators and matrix interleavers. This LPTVMA system has good spreading properties and small Multi User Interference (MUI). However, the equalization problem of such LPTV filters in stationary multipath channels remains unsolved. We show that, due to the presence of matrix interleavers, the received signal is affected by a time varying delay. By using a Zero Padding (ZP) technique, classical single user equalization techniques can be used. Further, when the users in the LPTVMA system are quasi-synchronous, MUI-free transceivers can be achieved. Comparisons of the LPTVMA system with a Chip Interleaved Block Spread (CIBS) - CDMA system are made in quasi-synchronous and asynchronous scenarios. Simulations showed that the LPTVMA system has better performances in the asynchronous scenario than the CIBS-CDMA system.	computer simulation;interference (communication);low-power broadcasting;magic user interface;multipath propagation;performance;stationary process;transceiver	Bogdan Cristea;Daniel Roviras;Benoît Escrig	2005	2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;delay spread	HPC	44.99958819123164	78.51993770661655	51847

The use of a channel estimator and equalizer counteracts the channel induced distortions and thus improves the system's Bit Error Rate (BER). In our study, a simple-to-implement channel estimator is proposed. It is based on averaging the sub-channel frequency responses of successive OFDM symbols in time, considering a very slow time-varying channel. In the frequency domain, spline interpolation is applied. The proposed estimator can be used in practical receivers with limited computation power and low memory capacity.	bit error rate;computation;digital video broadcasting;distortion;equalization (communications);frequency response;spline interpolation;throughput;x.690	Spiridon Zettas;Pavlos I.

821bd476f378494fe1e9a0b4214e91831aa8c839	nonlinear precoding for phase-quantized constant-envelope massive mu-mimo-ofdm		We propose a nonlinear phase-quantized constant-envelope precoding algorithm for the massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink. Specifically, we adapt the squared-infinity norm Douglas-Rachford splitting (SQUID) precoder to systems that use oversampling digital-to-analog converters (DACs) at the base station (BS) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to communicate over frequency-selective channels. We demonstrate that the proposed SQUID-OFDM precoder is able to generate transmit signals that are constrained to constant envelope, which enables the use of power-efficient analog radio-frequency circuitry at the BS. By quantizing the phase of the resulting constant-envelope signal, we obtain a finite-cardinality transmit signal that can be synthesized by low-resolution (e.g., 1-bit) DACs. We use error-rate simulations to demonstrate the superiority of SQUID-OFDM over linear-quantized precoders for massive MU-MIMO-OFDM systems.	1-bit architecture;12-bit;algorithm;baseband;computational complexity theory;digital-to-analog converter;electronic circuit;iteration;mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;nonlinear system;oversampling;radio frequency;simulation;telecommunications link;use error	Sven Jacobsson;Oscar Castañeda;Charles Jeon;Giuseppe Durisi;Christoph Studer	2018	2018 25th International Conference on Telecommunications (ICT)	10.1109/ICT.2018.8464896	real-time computing;mimo;automatic gain control;multi-user mimo;oversampling;telecommunications link;topology;precoding;computer science;multiplexing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing	EDA	43.54779860925616	86.3790001535675	52777

Several criteria can satisfy this goal. In this paper, we introduce a new criterion to optimize the OFDM/OQAM pulse shape. The proposed criterion is flexible and leads to a fast design optimization procedure.

In this letter, curve fitting technique has been employed to express bit error probability over AWGN of any digital modulation scheme in terms of a simple Gaussian function. Using this Gaussian function, a generalized closed form expression for computing average probability of bit error over Rayleigh fading channels has been derived.

In this letter, we investigate the compensation of channel reciprocity for TDD massive MIMO-OFDM systems in the presence of IQ imbalances at both the transmitter and receiver. A frequency-domain compensation scheme is proposed, which uses compensation matrices to precode uplink and downlink transmissions. By disassembling the effective channel model into pairs of mirror subcarriers and utilizing block matrix inversion, the compensation matrices can be calculated with a complexity that is linear in the number of antennas at the base station and mobile station. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	channel (communications);duplex (telecommunications);elegant degradation;frequency divider;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;subcarrier;telecommunications link;test-driven development;transmitter;x.690	Yan Liang;Hongbin Li;Fei Li;Rongfang Song;Lihua Yang	2017	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2017.2740936	mimo;computer network;telecommunications link;mathematics;mimo-ofdm;transmitter;mobile station;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;electronic engineering;base station;communication channel	Mobile	48.76413018837038	80.56691739174732	53356

It has been shown that conventional waveform design can significantly improve the system performance of TR systems. However, when the symbol rate is very high, the severe intersymbol interference still limits the performance at high-power region. In this work, we study a new waveform design with interference pre-cancellation by exploiting the message information to further improve the performance. In the proposed design, the causal interference is subtracted by interference compensation, and the anticausal interference can be further suppressed by conventional waveform design by virtue of the more abundant degrees of freedom. The transmitter utilizes the information of previous symbols to enhance the signal quality while the receiver structure remains simple. In the multiuser scenario, both the interuser interference and intersymbol interference can be similarly categorized by the causality, and then be tackled accordingly by the proposed waveform design with interference pre-cancellation. The resulting multiuser waveform design is a nonconvex optimization problem, for which two iterative algorithms are proposed and both are guaranteed to converge to suboptimal solutions. Simulation results validate the convergence behavior and demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement over the conventional waveform design in the previous work.	algorithm;anticausal system;categorization;causality;converge;convex optimization;gradient method;interference (communication);iterative method;mathematical optimization;multi-user;optimization problem;scenario (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;t-symmetry;transistor;transmitter;waveform;x.690;iui	Yu-Han Yang;K.

09b159c5b05b6d9a2d551ae958da984d35e87d81	performance analysis of ofdm over multi-scale multi-lag channels		Due to the low speed of sound in water, the underwater acoustic (UWA) signal suffers obvious time scaling when relative motion exists between the transceivers. In general, given a single scale, the scaling-induced distortion can be rectified by a resampling operation. However, the scaling coefficients of the channel paths may be different from each other, especially in shallow water. In recent years, a multi-scale multi-lag (MSML) model has been used to describe the high speed mobile UWA channels in the literature. In this paper, we analyze the performance of OFDM system under this model. Considering the resalmper as a part of the channel, we get a an equivalent MSML channel. We first derive the sub-channel gains in closed form, and then get the analytical expression of the average channel gains and inter-carrier interference (ICI) under given statistics of the channel paths. Finally, we discuss the average achievable rate of the system and get a lower bound of that in closed form.	acoustic cryptanalysis;coefficient;distortion;ici (programming language);image scaling;interference (communication);profiling (computer programming);rectifier (neural networks);resampling (statistics);shallow parsing;transceiver	Yun Liu;Fei Ji;Fangjiong Chen;Miaowen Wen;Hua Yu;Yinming Cui	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8287943	msml;speed of sound;electronic engineering;scaling;distortion;interference (wave propagation);computer science;lag;communication channel;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing	Robotics	42.03010189271755	80.58648631476926	53685

It is shown that relaying achieves SNR (signal-to-noise power ratio) gain over DT due to less pathloss, but with several relaying penalties, including a lower multiplexing gain (due to half-duplex), a lower transmit power and a higher outage requirement at each hop (due to multi-hop). We determine the conditions over which relaying outperforms DT, where the SNR gain is greater than the loss due to relaying penalties. The result is applied to the LTE-advanced networks (LTE-A) where the relay nodes (RNs) are implemented to relay information between the user equipment (UE) and the evolutional NodeB (eNB). The major difference between LTE-A and a general relay system lies in that the UE-RN hop consists of multiple frequency-division access links, while the RN-eNB hop is a point-to-point link. By investigating the effects of diversity gain on the transmission rate, we propose an outage-capacity based adaptive relaying (OCA-R) scheme to replace the conventional same-carrier relaying (SC-R). It is shown that the transmission rates of both SC-R and OCA-R are one half of the harmonic means between the outage-capacities for two hops, where the advantage of OCA-R over SC-R comes from a higher diversity gain in the RN-eNB link.	compaq lte;downtime;duplex (telecommunications);multiplexing;noise power;point-to-point (telecommunications);relay;signal-to-noise ratio;sun outage	Shenghui Song;Ali F.

In this context, we consider several optimal classification schemes such as support vector classifiers (SVC), logistic regression (LR) and quadratic discrimination (QD) for primary user detection. It is demonstrated that these classification techniques have a significantly reduced complexity of implementation in practical CR applications compared to conventional likelihood based detection schemes as they do not require knowledge of the channel state information and noise power. Further, in the presence of disruptive malicious users, the proposed classifiers have a significantly lower detection error compared to conventional detection schemes. Also, we propose a novel QD classifier for blind MIMO spectrum sensing scenarios. The detection performance of the proposed classifiers is compared with existing schemes in co-operative CR scenarios. It is demonstrated through simulation of several scenarios including the presence of malicious users, Doppler shift, and carrier frequency offset that the proposed classifiers offer a robust and significantly superior alternative to existing schemes for co-operative MIMO CR spectrum sensing.	carrier frequency offset;channel state information;cognitive radio;cooperative mimo;distortion;doppler effect;lr parser;logistic regression;malware;multi-user mimo;noise power;quantum dot;selectivity (electronic);simulation	Siddharth Sharma;Aditya K.

However, such systems are very sensitive to imperfections in the analog front-end, resulting in radio frequency (RF) impairments such as in-phase/quadrature-phase (IQ) imbalance and carrier frequency offset (CFO). The RF impairments in such low cost front-end systems are unavoidable and can result in a severe performance degradation. In this paper we propose a generally applicable equalization technique for space-time block coded (STBC) MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems. The Alamouti based STBC scheme is examined in detail. It is shown that the compensation scheme can be easily extended to other higher order STBC systems. We consider a digital compensation scheme for joint transmitter and receiver IQ imbalance along with front-end filter mismatch, CFO and frequency selective channel distortions.	analog front-end;carrier frequency offset;distortion;elegant degradation;fast fourier transform;frequency divider;in-phase and quadrature components;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multipath propagation;multiplexing;radio frequency;transmitter	Deepaknath Tandur;Marc Moonen	2008	2008 IEEE 68th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2008.131	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;control theory	EDA	49.15348863452048	79.83475325284519	53902

In this paper, we consider signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation in the presence of constant deterministic interference. A maximum likelihood (ML) non-data-aided algorithm is proposed for SNR estimation. We first consider a real-valued model and then extend this to a complex-valued model. The proposed algorithm applies an iterative approach initialized with approximate closed form estimates so as to guarantee stability and convergence. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is also derived as the theoretical limit of the jitter variance. Computer simulations based on pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) sources show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is close to the CRB.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;interference (communication);iterative method;kernel density estimation;pulse-width modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Fangjiong Chen;Yabing Kang;Hua Yu;Fei Ji	2014	EURASIP J.

384cc0a62dd93789fcc57905bde5a06abbb5c196	hybrid beamforming design with finite-resolution phase-shifters for frequency selective massive mimo channels		Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) theoretical performance results have attracted the attention of the community due to the possibility of increasing the spectral efficiency in wireless communications. The performance potential is mainly conditioned to the use of digital beamforming techniques which demand one radio-frequency (RF) chain per antenna element. For large arrays, this implementation may result in high complexity, power consumption, and cost. To reduce the number of RF chains, we use a hybrid beamforming (HB) architecture of an analog beamformer implemented by using phase-shifters and a low-dimensional digital beamformer. The performance of the HB depends on the resolution of the phase-shifters. However, very few works in the literature take into account finite phase-shifters. In this paper, we address the problem of designing HB in frequency selective channels using finite-resolution phase-shifters. The strategy is to exploit the second-order statistics of the channel and a least-square formulation to obtain the discrete phase of each phase-shifter. The digital part is derived based on analog solution to maximize the single-user MIMO system sum-rate. This solution requires a number of RF chains compared to the rank of the spatial covariance matrix which is far lower than ones demanded to implement the full digital beamforming. The simulation results show that the proposed technique can achieve a sum-rate performance very close to that of the digital beamforming assuming low-rank channels.	beamforming;mimo;multi-user;radio frequency;simulation;spectral efficiency	Daniel C.

Many schemes have been proposed to suppress ICI, but they are computationally complex or at the price of sacrificing bandwidth. In this paper, we provide an ICI analysis in time domain while existing literatures analyze the ICI effects mainly in frequency domain. Basing on this analysis, we propose a time-domain ICI mitigation method whose complexity is linear in the OFDM symbol length. The method does not reduce any redundancy, and thus has high bandwidth efficiency. Theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed method can effectively mitigate ICI with low complexity.	computational complexity theory;frequency divider;ici (programming language);interference (communication);multiplexing;redundancy (engineering);simulation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;zero suppression	Shaoping Chen;Tianren Yao	2004	2004 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

The algorithms operate within a self-referencing matched filter synchronizer structure, and are particularly useful in reducing synchronization overhead on links designed to carry packet-type services. The main distinguishing characteristic between the two schemes is that one uses hard-decision while the other uses soft-decision detection. The proposed schemes are especially applicable to reverse link transmissions in quasisynchronous CDMA systems in which timing at portable terminals is established via pilot and synchronization signals received on respective code-division channels from the home base. If discontinuous (bursty) transmission is used on reverse links, the acquisition process is required for each transmission burst because of the propagation time uncertainty. Analysis of the algorithms on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels reveals that their Performance depends significantly on the choice of synchronizer parameters and the average despread signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). When this choice is proper, acquisition over a single preamble of relatively short duration can be achieved with high probability.

Combining RM QRM-MLD and IAC, within a high Eb/No range, the BER performance of the algorithm degrade because of excess reduction of surviving symbol replica candidates at each stage.

Conventional channel sounders employ the same transmit power level when operating over a specific frequency band. However, the maximum-tolerable transmit power levels permitted across the spectrum within a DSA network can potentially be non-uniform. Our proposed channel sounder is designed to tailor the transmit power level across the frequency band of operation, limiting it to the constraints imposed by both licensed and unlicensed devices, as well as by regulatory agencies. Employing a combination of multicarrier spread spectrum modulation and a conventional channel sounding approach, our proposed technique achieves a mean squared error of the estimated channel impulse response of 10-3 at an SNR of -13 dB and -17 dB respectively for 15- and 31-chip spreading sequences.	agile software development;automatic sounding;broadcast delay;catastrophic interference;code;cognitive radio;committed information rate;cross-correlation;decibel;frequency band;interference (communication);mean squared error;modulation;operating environment;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Qinfei Chen;Alexander M.

Recently, we introduced an OFDM-AF schemes that achieves significant SNR gains by reordering groups of received subcarriers (chunks) at the relay station to optimally couple them into the 2n hop channel. This reordering process, however, destroys the correlation between chunks, so channel estimation techniques based on interpolation no longer work. To mitigate this problem, we propose to insert a new pilot grid at the relay station in addition to the existing pilot grid. At the mobile, channel estimation is performed in two steps, where the 2n and 1 hop channels are estimated separately. The proposed pilot and channel estimation scheme allows to fully exploit the gains through chunk reordering at the relay station with only a small increase in complexity.	anisotropic filtering;broadcast relay station;channel state information;interpolation;mimo-ofdm;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;subcarrier	Markus Herdin;Gunther Auer	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.264	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	48.12772876197872	79.63332224859697	54783

Such techniques have the potential to increase the number of supportable users and increase per-user throughput. To realize these gains in actual systems, however, channel estimation capabilities sufficient for successful PH-MUD must be developed. In fact, the fundamental feature of such systems, hopping, requires that estimation be performed on a perhop basis, which precludes training amortization. We describe potential estimation techniques for PH-MUD and evaluate the resulting overhead, energy requirements, and performance. Practical estimation techniques with reasonable overhead are seen to provide good PH-MUD performance; thus PH-MUD remains a promising capability for frequency-hopping systems.	channel state information;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;mud;multi-user;overhead (computing);requirement;throughput	David Qiu;IV C.

13badc8a0ebe060944b9aabf3f1b4cfb8e13a07d	a multilayer perceptron-based impulsive noise detector with application to power-line-based sensor networks		For power-line-based sensor networks, impulsive noise (IN) will dramatically degrade the data transmission rate in the power line. In this paper, we present a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based approach to detect IN in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based baseband power line communications (PLCs). Combining the MLP-based IN detection method with the outlier detection theory allows more accurate identification of the harmful residual IN. For OFDM-based PLC systems, the high peak-to-average power ratio of the received signal makes detection of harmful residual IN more challenging. The detection mechanism works in an iterative receiver that contains a pre-IN mitigation and a post-IN mitigation. The pre-IN mitigation is meant to null the stronger portion of IN, while the post-IN mitigation suppresses the residual portion of IN using an iterative process. Compared with previously reported IN detectors, the simulation results show that our MLP-based IN detector improves the resulting bit error rate performance.	anomaly detection;baseband;bit error rate;detection theory;iteration;memory-level parallelism;multilayer perceptron;multiplexing;power-line communication;quad flat no-leads package;sensor;simulation	Ying-Ren Chien;Jie-Wei Chen;Sendren Sheng-Dong Xu	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2825239	residual;computer network;bit error rate;electronic engineering;computer science;data transmission;multilayer perceptron;detector;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;baseband;multiplexing	Mobile	48.69510506644391	85.35881158720599	54855

Existing techniques like e.g. control coding do not reduce the computational load when reducing data rates. In this paper, we introduce differential Extended Symbol OFDM (differential ES-OFDM) which is based on the transmission of symbols that are extended in time. This way it can operate at low SNR. Using differential BPSK modulation, approximately 2.1 dB SNR improvement per doubling of the symbol length (halving the bitrate) is obtained. The sensitivity to frequency offsets of differential ES-OFDM is basically independent of symbol extension. Extending symbols reduces the computational load on the radio modem within the transmitter which is essential to reduce overall power consumption. The differential ES-OFDM receiver architecture also offers opportunities to reduce power consumption.		André B. J. Kokkeler;Gerard J. M.

The evaluation is based on the following specifications: IEEE 802.15.3c and IEEE 802.11ad, which have been designed to provide data rates of multi-Gbps at physical layer. First, by using measured power delay profiles (PDPs) in hospital environments, both inter-symbol-interference (ISI) and channel capacity are calculated. Then, system simulations are carried out in order to show achievable throughputs. The results reveal that OFDM systems provide the required throughput for the application scenario in all the measured PDPs. On the other hand, the single carrier (SC) systems without any equalization are limited to 85 % of the measured PDPs where the required throughput is achieved. Also, it is shown that the calculated channel capacity for each measured PDP reveals the similar trend with the available throughputs obtained from the system simulations.	channel capacity;data rate units;interference (communication);performance evaluation;simulation;throughput	Kenichi Takizawa;Mikko Kyrö;Katsuyuki Haneda;Hiroaki Hagiwara;Pertti Vainikainen	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364610	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;intersymbol interference;computer network	Visualization	41.08625101555349	79.24847889122219	55109

Vector precoding (VP) is one of the most promising non-linear precoding schemes, which achieves a performance close to the optimum albeit impractical dirty paper coding (DPC) with a feasible complexity. This contribution presents a novel design for the hardware implementation of a high-throughput vector precoder based on the Fixed Sphere Encoder (FSE) algorithm. The proposed fixed-complexity scheme greatly reduces the complexity of the most intricate part of VP, namely the search for the perturbing signal in an infinite lattice. Additionally, an optimized reduced-complexity implementation is presented which considerably reduces the resource usage at the cost of a small performance loss. Provided simulation results show the better performance of the proposed vector precoder in comparison to other fixed-complexity approaches, such as the K-Best precoder, under similar complexity constraints.

Linear precoders are usually designed to reverse the distortion that the channel inflicts on the transmitted data signals. This way, the information symbols are pre-multiplied by a precoding matrix which can be designed based on different criteria. If a zero-forcing (ZF) approach is followed, the removal of all the interference between the users’ streams is required, which leads to the precoding matrix being reduced to a simple channel inversion (Peel, Hochwald, & Swindlehurst, 2005). The main drawback of this straightforward approach is the considerable increment in the power of the precoded signal, especially for ill-conditioned channels, which results in a substantial noise enhancement and a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receivers. This problem can be overcome by allowing for some interference among the users’ streams. The relaxation in the design constraints derives in the insertion of a regularization term in the channel inversion. The resulting linear precoder, also known as the regularized inversion precoder, outperforms the ZF approach especially in the low SNR regime (Peel, Hochwald, & Swindlehurst, 2005). It is also possible to design the precoding matrix following a Wiener filter approach in such a way that the mean square error (MSE) is minimized. Having a lower MSE, this approach outperforms the previous ones in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance. A considerable performance improvement over linear precoding techniques can be achieved by including non-linear signal processing algorithms at both ends of the communication link. Nevertheless, the enhanced performance is a consequence of an extra added complexity, which may be prohibitive for realtime practical systems. This is the case of the well-known and capacity achieving dirty paper coding (DPC) technique presented in Costa (1983). Despite its relevance in the theoretic assessment of the capacity of multiuser broadcast channels, the large amount of required channel state information at the transmitter side and the great sensitivity to possible imperfections in this information render it unsuitable for practical implementation. This has led to the development of other non-linear precoding algorithms that aim at achieving a similar performance with a more reasonable complexity. One of the most noteworthy methods of non-linear pre-processing is Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (THP), which was originally developed in Harashima (1972) and Tomlinson (1971) to mitigate the effect of intersymbol interference and was later adapted for transmission over MIMO channels in Fischer, Windpassinger, Lampe, and Huber (2002). The most remarkable feature of this precoding approach is the insertion of a modulo operation at both ends of the communication link in order to reduce the power of the precoded symbols. The modulo operator at the transmitter side can be equivalently replaced by the addition of a perturbing signal which can be optimized directly following various design criteria, such as minimizing the transmit power of the precoded symbols or optimizing the overall MSE. This leads us to the concept of vector precoding (VP) (Hochwald, Peel, & Swindlehurst, 2005), which improves the performance of THP at the expense of a greater complexity. Although VP bridges the gap to the capacity limit set by DPC, the computation of the perturbing signal represents a challenge for its hardware implementation as it entails a search for the closest point in an infinite lattice. One of the most popular schemes to reduce the complexity of the aforementioned search is the sphere encoder (SE) algorithm. Despite its optimal performance, the variable complexity and sequential nature of the algorithm hinder its hardware implementation. A suboptimal method for the computation of the perturbing vector is proposed (Windpassinger, Fischer, & Huber, 2004), where the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovász’s (LLL) lattice reduction algorithm (Lenstra, Lenstra, & Lovász, 1982) is used along with the Babai’s approximate closest point solution. Even though the performance of this technique is very close to that of the optimal sphere encoder, the hardware implementation of the required LLL preprocessing stage is a complex matter. 16 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/design-implementation-lowcomplexity-multiuser/62991?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Communications and Social Science.

Firstly, we derive the closed-form expression of the non-asymptotic downlink (DL) achievable rate by using the second-order channel statistical information. Based on this, we present the spatial orthogonality condition for inter-cell pilot reuse without rate loss, which offers a powerful way to discriminate UTs in the same time-frequency interval. Regarding that the spatial orthogonality condition can not always be met over realistic channels, we further propose a spatial orthogonality-based greedy pilot assignment algorithm which exploits the statistical channel covariance information. The simulation results indicate that, in the large-number-of-antennas, the pilot contamination effect can be vanished completely under the spatial orthogonality condition presented, and pilot reuse among inter-cell UTs will not incur any rate loss. The proposed spatial orthogonality-based greedy pilot assignment algorithm can provide a substantial gain in system rate performance.	greedy algorithm;mimo;pilot ace;simulation;telecommunications link	Mingmei Li;Shi Jin;Xiqi Gao	2013	2013 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing	10.1109/WCSP.2013.6677139	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	40.508496959025614	85.42652492159328	55235

Maximum beamforming (MB) is used for SNR improvement but just in single-substream transmission. MB-BD is based on maximum beamforming for multi-substream transmission and can improve the received SNR at each antenna of desired users because it uses the sum space of the eigenvectors which correspond to the strong eigenvalues (eigen modes) to transmit data for desired users. Comparing to block diagonalization (BD), MB-BD has 6dB gain if we set constraint of BER at 10-3 and the sum rate of the proposed method is identical to BD. MB-BD has lower computational complexity than BD because it needs only to do one SVD (or EVD) and one QR decomposition for computing the precoding matrix of each user. We can get about 37.5% reduction of computational complexity at transmitter. To enhance the detection performance and lower computational complexity, we use simplified maximum likelihood (SML) at each receiver. Comparing to original ML, we can get about 33.33% reduction of computational complexity at receiver.	beamforming;blu-ray;computation;computational complexity theory;deferred procedure call;eigen (c++ library);gaussian elimination;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;qr decomposition;set constraint;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;singular value decomposition;spatial multiplexing;telecommunications link;transmitter;x.690	Yen-Hsu Chiang;Hsi-Pin Ma	2012	2012 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2012.6167557	electronic engineering;telecommunications;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	47.84379384837868	78.08754080792565	55348

It is shown that the TDS-OFDM still fulfils the circular convolution relationship even if pseudo-noise (PN) sequence is used as guard interval. While conventional methods perform the channel estimation based on the cyclic prefix reconstruction or residual intersymbol interference cancellation in the time domain, by processing the data part and the known symbol padding in one TDS-OFDM block separately, the new proposal uses the one- tap frequency-domain equalization to separate the data part and the known symbol padding and the CIR can be estimated in an iterative manner. In a typical example for 3780-point FFT based TDS-OFDM system with 16QAM constellations, the mean square error (MSE) of of the proposed channel estimator can be reduced to about 10-5/2 after two iterations when the channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is larger than 8 dB, without the initial CIR estimation. The BER performance of a QPSK TDS-OFDM system shows that the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) degradation based on the proposed channel estimator is less than 0.3 dB compared with the lower bound for both Brazil A and B channels.	algorithm;channel state information;circular convolution;committed information rate;discrete fourier transform;elegant degradation;equalization (communications);fast fourier transform;interference (communication);iteration;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;pseudorandom number generator;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;x.690	Shigang Tang;Fang Yang;Kewu Peng;Chang-Yong Pan;Ke Gong;Zhixing Yang	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.812	speech recognition;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;time domain;computer science;mean squared error;iterative method;upper and lower bounds;signal-to-noise ratio;transient response;frequency domain;intersymbol interference	Mobile	48.93619561254117	78.13101215688144	55565

However, reliable communication in multiuser systems is affected by the presence of both multi-access interference (MAI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) in multi-path channels. In this paper, we therefore investigate a transceiver design for a wideband multiuser-MiMO communication system, where the co-channel users are equipped with multiple transmit and multiple receive antennas. In particular, we propose a two-step interference cancellation scheme with an error correction coding technique for the receiver of a multiuser uplink system. The scheme employs orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation and space-time block codes (STBC). The receiver performs as a soft output multiuser detector based on minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) interference suppression at the first stage, and then, MAI cancellation is implemented with a bank of single-user channel decoders. The paper also includes computer simulations which help to improve the understanding of specific issues involved in the design of multiuser STBC-OFDM systems, and confirm the utility of the proposed approach.	algorithm;block code;channel capacity;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;data compression;error detection and correction;forward error correction;frequency divider;half rate;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;modulation;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;transceiver;transmitter;zero suppression	Xiang Lin;Mathini Sellathurai;Jonathon A.

The linear frequency modulation (LFM) signals are employed as transmitted waveforms. Based on the sensed statistics of the target and clutter-plus-noise, assuming the LFM waveforms transmitted at different transmitters can have different starting frequencies and bandwidths, these waveform parameters are designed to maximize the signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio at the receiver of the cognitive MIMO radar system. The constraints of the allowable range of operating frequency and total transmit energy are considered. We show that in the tested examples, the designed waveforms are nonorthogonal which leads to superior performance compared with that of the frequency spread LFM waveforms commonly used in the traditional MIMO radar systems.

In order to incorporate the impact of this random phenomenon on system analysis and design, in many cases, we need to calculate the probability density function (pdf) of the received signal envelope in multipath fading channels. In this paper, we consider a general multipath fading channel with arbitrary number of paths, where the amplitudes of multipath components are arbitrary correlated positive random variables, independent of phases, whereas the phases are independent and identically distributed random variables with uniform distributions. Since the integral form of the envelope pdf for such a general channel model is too complicated to be used for analytic calculations, we propose two infinite expansions for the pdf: a Laguerre series and a power series. Based on the tight uniform upper bounds on the truncation error of these two infinite series, we show that the Laguerre series is superior to the power series due to the fact that for a fixed number of terms, it yields a smaller truncation error. This Laguerre series with a finite number of terms, which expresses the envelope pdf just in terms of simple polynomial-exponential kernels, is particularly useful for mathematical performance prediction of communication systems in those indoor and outdoor multipath propagation environments, where the number of strong multipath components is small.	channel (communications);multipath propagation;performance prediction;polynomial;portable document format;software propagation;system analysis;time complexity;truncation error	Ali Abdi	2009	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2009.2032824	multipath propagation;random variable;stochastic process;telecommunications;delay spread;laguerre polynomials;mathematics;fading;statistics	Embedded	39.764009386505386	76.67625189408777	56193

The basic idea is to equalize the channel stage by stage. To begin with the stage with the highest signal power level, the BCJR algorithm is used to equalize each level by averaging the interference of the undecoded levels. Both the hard and soft decisions are passed to the next stages. The scheme hugely reduces the complexity of full-branch BCJR on the entire received page of data and makes the equalization applicable. Based on the statistic output of each stage the overall information rates are evaluated. Furthermore, the coding simulation results are presented. All of these results show the proposed scheme is a good candidate for decoding such M-ary 2D ISI channels.	algorithmic efficiency;bcjr algorithm;information sciences institute;interference (communication);multistage amplifier;simulation	Jiaxi Xiao;Arash Karbaschi;Ali Adibi;Steven W.

efef30bf5bba77b88985e48828b46dcd083e9d00	a fast start-up modified lms algorithm		Due to the time-delay spread of the channel, the equalizers for high data rate mobile communication systems has critical importance in mitigation of inter-symbol interference (ISI). One of the most important channel equalization algorithms is the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm. However, the slow convergence rate and the need for long training sequences are the major disadvantages of the LMS algorithm. In this paper, a faststart-up modified LMS (FSU-M-LMS) algorithm based on channel matched filter (CMF) has been proposed to increase the convergence speed and performance of the LMS algorithm. In order to prove the performance of the proposed method, computer simulations are performed on stationary and nonstationary frequency selective Rayleigh fading channels. The obtained simulation results illustrate that the proposed FSU-M-LMS algorithm has better mean square error (MSE), bit error rate (BER) and channel tracking performances than the conventional LMS, modified LMS (M-LMS), normalized LMS (N-LMS) and conventional RLS algorithm.	algorithm;bit error rate;computer simulation;interference (communication);least mean squares filter;matched filter;mean squared error;performance;rate of convergence;rayleigh fading;recursive least squares filter;stationary process;uncompressed video;x.690	Elif Nur Ayvaz;Meryem Maras;Ali Özen	2018	2018 26th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2018.8404487	pattern recognition;rayleigh fading;artificial intelligence;control theory;rate of convergence;computer science;least mean squares filter;signal-to-noise ratio;bit error rate;matched filter;recursive least squares filter;communication channel	Mobile	49.86367778319746	75.85691817826066	56571

Since different subcarriers see different channel gains in frequency-selective channels, the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) of the codeword must be selected based on the vector of signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) of these subcarriers. Exponential effective SNR mapping (EESM) maps the vector of SNRs into an equivalent flat-fading SNR, and is widely used to simplify this problem. We develop a new analytical framework to characterize the throughput of EESM-based rate adaptation in such wideband channels in the presence of feedback delays. We derive a novel accurate approximation for the throughput as a function of feedback delay. We also propose a novel bivariate gamma distribution to model the time evolution of EESM between the times of estimation and data transmission, which facilitates the analysis. These are then generalized to a multi-cell, multi-user scenario with various frequency-domain schedulers. Unlike prior work, most of which is simulation-based, our framework encompasses both correlated and independent subcarriers and various multiple antenna diversity modes; it is accurate over a wide range of delays.	approximation;bivariate data;code word;compaq lte;frequency divider;modulation;multi-user;multiplexing;scenario (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;the times;throughput	Jobin Francis;Neelesh B.

In this part of the paper, optimization over the proposed class of systems is considered for a fixed number of users per unit bandwidth. The first case studied is a system where the only noise not attributable to users in the system is additive white Gaussian noise. It is observed that either a system employing exclusive allocation, where users are allocated time-bandwidth resources that are not simultaneously shared with other users, or a system employing maximum resource sharing, where all users simultaneously share time-bandwidth resources, is optimal. Next, the preferable of these two extreme forms of resource allocation is determined. For any reasonable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and user density, it is shown that the system employing exclusive resource allocation is optimal in a single-cell environment with perfect subchannel separation at the receiver. Finally, the optimization is repeated in the presence of partial-band interference (PBI). Once again, either a system employing exclusive resource allocation or a system employing a maximum resource sharing scheme is observed to be optimal. The presence of the PBI increases the range of user densities and SNR’s where a system employing a maximum resource sharing scheme is optimal, particularly when the probability of a particular time-bandwidth slot experiencing interference is high.	additive white gaussian noise;coherence (physics);digital subchannel;exclusive or;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-user;signal-to-noise ratio;utility functions on indivisible goods	Dennis Goeckel;Wayne E.

However, FTN transmissions introduce inter-symbol interference (ISI), antenna polarization multiplexing suffers from cross-polarization interference (XPI) and HoM makes a communication system vulnerable to phase-noise (PN) distortions. In this work, we investigate for the first time a DP-FTN HoM transmission system that offers more than 150% increase in SE compared to a single-polarized Nyquist transmission. We propose an interference cancellation and PN mitigation structure coupled with adaptive decision-feedback equalization to jointly mitigate XPI, FTN and multipath ISI, and accomplish carrier-phase tracking. Numerical results confirm that a DP-FTN transmission can yield a 3–6 dB performance improvement over an equivalent DP-Nyquist system that uses a higher modulation order to achieve the same data rate.	backhaul (telecommunications);data rate units;distortion;elegant degradation;information sciences institute;interference (communication);least mean squares filter;modulation;multipath propagation;multiplexing;nyquist rate;phase noise;polarization (waves);signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;uncompressed video;vulnerability (computing)	Mrinmoy Jana;Lutz H.-J.

However, the flexibility of choosing a pulse shaping filter may result in intercarrier interference (ICI) and intersymbol interference (ISI), which becomes more severe in a broadband channel. In order to eliminate the ISI and ICI, based on discrete Gabor transform (DGT), in this paper, a transmit GFDM signal is first treated as an inverse DGT, and then a frequency-domain DGT is formulated to recover (as a receiver) the GFDM signal. Furthermore, to reduce the complexity, a suboptimal frequency-domain DGT called local DGT is developed. Some analyses are also given for the proposed DGT-based receivers.	catastrophic interference;frequency divider;ici (programming language);interference (communication);multiplexing;noise shaping;pulse shaping;waveform	Peng Wei;Xiang-Gen Xia;Yue Xiao;Shaoqian Li	2016	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2598568	transmitter;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;interference;frequency domain	Visualization	48.99129367922297	81.66304204477562	57258

In a heterogeneous environment, the test and training data have different covariance matrices. An approximate expression for the expectation of the normalized output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) (i.e., the average SINR loss) is derived with the consideration of both the signal steering vector mismatch and environmental heterogeneity. Simulation results show that the analytical results are very close to the results obtained by using Monte Carlo techniques. This theoretical expression can be used to facilitate the performance evaluation of the SMI beamformer in real scenarios where the mismatch and heterogeneity cannot be neglected. & 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the effectiveness of OFDM in the receivers is impaired by inter-carrier interference (ICI) due to the significant time variations under UWA channels. In this letter, we consider the weighted-type fractional Fourier transform (WFRFT)-based hybrid carrier (HC) modulation system with PFFT demodulation for UWA communication. The residual ICI, after PFFT demodulation and weight compensation, can be further suppressed in the WFRFT domain. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the superiority of HC scheme with PFFT demodulation over the single carrier (SC) and OFDM schemes with PFFT demodulation at a very moderate complexity.	acoustic cryptanalysis;fast fourier transform;fractional fourier transform;frequency divider;ici (programming language);interference (communication);modulation;multiplexing;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio	Yong Li;Xuejun Sha;Kun Wang	2013	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2013.102613.131651	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science	HPC	48.61100905831952	80.41152062604348	57347

In this paper, we propose a primary interference suppression technique by using direct sequence spread spectrum. We show that secondary users can efficiently suppress the high power signal from a primary transmitter by using proper processing gains. Also, we propose a simple deployed underlay transmission scheme in a host channel for a secondary network. We show that by using primary interference suppression for direct sequence spread spectrum links our proposed transmission scheme achieves 186.09 Mbps and 362.73 Mbps capacity respectively at the center and at the edge of a primary cell when there are 60 secondary channel applicants in secondary network and processing gain is 100. Also, we show that the achieved capacity is gained without producing harmful interference temperature in the host channel and perceptible interference in adjacent channels.	data rate units;interference (communication);process gain;transmitter;zero suppression	Shadi Ebrahimi Asl;Bahman Abolhassani	2009	2009 First International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks	10.1109/CICSYN.2009.16	transmitter;adjacent-channel interference;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing	Mobile	46.19591758081366	83.68571855583886	57512
ce768dba0e8d9281f0a1a1dc5971b1d0b2053326	low complexity modem structure for ofdm-based orthogonal time frequency space modulation		Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a 2-D signaling technique that has recently emerged in the literature to tackle the time-varying (TV) wireless channels. OTFS deploys the Doppler-delay plane to multiplex the transmit data where the time variations of the TV channel are integrated over time and hence the equivalent channel relating the input and output of the system boils down to a time-invariant one. This signaling technique can be implemented on the top of a given multicarrier waveform with the addition of precoding and post-processing units to the modulator and demodulator. In this letter, we present discrete-time formulation of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based OTFS system. We argue against deployment of window functions at the OTFS transmitter in realistic scenarios and thus limit any sort of windowing to the receiver side. We study the channel impact in discrete-time providing deeper insights into OTFS systems. Moreover, our derivations lead to simplified modulator and demodulator structures that are far simpler than those in the literature.		Arman Farhang;Ahmad RezazadehReyhani;Linda E.

b6139ca7db1308c7577b94d0facf242f6420f6fe	time - frequency iterative multiuser detection in time - frequency-domain spread multicarrier ds-cdma systems over nakagami-m fading channels	time frequency	In this paper, we propose and study a novel Time–frequency-domain iterative multiuser detector (TF-IMUD) for the multicarrier direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) systems employing both time (T)-domain and frequency (F)-domain spreading, which, for brevity, are referred to as the TF/MC DS-CDMA systems. This novel TFIMUD consists of a set of T-domain soft-input soft-output MUDs (SISO-MUDs) and a set of F-domain SISO-MUDs, where information is exchanged between the T-domain and F-domain through two multiuser interference (MUI) cancellation units. The T-domain and F-domain SISO-MUDs are operated under the maximum likelihood (ML) principles, and they are facilitated to be implemented using parallel signal processing techniques. In this paper, the complexity of the TF-IMUD and the bit error rate (BER) performance of the TF/MC DS-CDMA systems employing the proposed TF-IMUD are investigated and also compared with the other existing MUD schemes, including the optimum ML-MUD and the joint/separate minimum mean-square error (MMSE)-MUDs. Our study and simulation results show that the TF-IMUD is capable of achieving nearly the same BER performance as the optimum ML-MUD, but at significantly lower complexity.

0ebc63546daa892bff30363f884cf18d19a8a96f	long-reach pon based on ssb modulated frequency-shifted qam and low-cost direct-detection receiver with kramers-kronig scheme		As PON systems move towards terabit/s aggregated data rates with longer transmission distance, optical coherent receivers become preferred due to their high tolerance to power fading from fiber transmission. To solve the high complexity and high cost problems of optical coherent receivers, a scheme for complex QAM signal transmission with simple direct detection is recommended in this paper. The scheme based on optical SSB modulation with frequency-shifted QAM signals and low-cost single-ended PD provides an efficient low-cost solution for long reach coherent PON. Due to its minimum phase property of the optical SSB modulated signal, Kramers-Kronig scheme can be used to reconstruct the complex QAM signal from the received intensity signal. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is validated by both numerical simulations and experiments for both QPSK and 16-QAM modulated signals. By using standard commercially available components, the experiments demonstrated that the combination of SSB modulation of frequency-shifted QAM signal and its single-ended PD receiver with KK scheme can support SSMF transmission over 75 km for both QPSK and 16-QAM signals with receiver optical power penalty less than 1.5 dB.

Our results apply for various modulation formats and arbitrary numbers of transmit and receive antennas. Our results show the average BER increases with channel estimation error, feedback delay and Ricean A'-factor at a polynomial rate that is inversely proportional to the difference between the numbers of transmit and receive antennas. We also show that the achievable BER performance is limited by the presence of an irreducible error floor as the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio increases.	bit error rate;channel state information;error floor;interference (communication);irreducibility;mimo;marginal model;modulation;polynomial;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;singular value decomposition;x.690	Edward K.

Any two codes OVSF of different levels are orthogonal if and only if one of two codes is not ancestor/descendant in each other. Therefore, when an OVSF code is assigned to a user, it blocks all of its ancestor and descendant codes. This results in a major drawback of OVSF codes, called blocking property: When an OVSF code is assigned, it blocks all of its ancestor and descendant codes from assignment because they are not orthogonal to each other. This paper presents a new extended orthogonal variable spreading factor (EOVSF) codes to support a quite large number code candidates for more user used in multi-rate next-generation wireless system. Thereby, no EOVSF code blocks the assignment of any other EOVSF code. It decreases more reject probability in WCDMA system.	blocking (computing);channelization (telecommunications);code::blocks;entity–relationship model;hadamard transform;linear algebra;milstein method;modulation;non-blocking algorithm;qr code;scheme;simulation;ubiquitous computing	Yih-Fuh Wang;Hsing-Hu Chen;Tun-Ying Lin	2006		10.1145/1143549.1143717	block code;concatenated error correction code;prefix code;turbo code;fountain code;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;linear code;w-cdma;computer network	OS	44.17018068716045	80.11016110147706	58050

To mitigate the effect of multiple access interference (MAI) caused by CFOs of different users, a new parallel interference cancellation (PIC) compensation algorithm is proposed. This scheme uses minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion to obtain the estimation of interference users, then circular convolutions [6] are employed to restore MAI and compensate CFO. To tackle the complexity problem of circular convolutions, an efficient MAI restoration and cancellation method is developed.

8cb7f8c84f8608fc6bfbda92c6aa1fac83a6c27e	performance of adaptive modulation with optimal switching thresholds for distributed antenna system in composite channels		In this paper, the performance of distributed antenna system (DAS) with adaptive modulation (AM) over a composite fading channel which takes path loss, Rayleigh fading, and log-normal shadowing into account is studied. Based on target bit error rate (BER), the AM scheme for DAS with average BER constraints is presented. The optimum switching thresholds (STs) for attaining maximum spectrum efficiency (SE) are derived by using Lagrange optimization method. An effective iterative algorithm based on Newton method for finding the optimal STs is proposed. With these thresholds, the closed-form expression of SE and average BER are derived for performance evaluation. Simulation results for SE and BER are in good agreement with the theoretical analysis. The results show that DAS-AM with optimal STs has higher SE than that with conventional fixed thresholds. Moreover, the proposed AM can fulfill the target BER for different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).	algorithm;bit error rate;iterative method;mathematical optimization;modulation;newton's method;performance evaluation;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;x.690	Binbin Wu;Xiangbin Yu;Ying Wang;Wenting Tan;Ming Chen	2015	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/s12243-015-0464-9	electronic engineering;telecommunications;control theory;mathematics	HPC	39.433015477578465	82.27331247099158	58339

We employ an eigenvalue perturbation theory based approach to model the uncertainty in the estimated signal covariance matrix. Subsequently, we derive an optimization framework for the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) based robust test statistic detector (RTSD) and robust estimator-correlator detector (RECD) towards primary user detection, which incorporate the channel state information (CSI) uncertainty inherent in such scenarios. Further, employing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, we derive closed form expressions for the proposed robust spectrum sensing schemes. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed robust detectors in comparison to the uncertainty agnostic estimator-correlator (EC) detector for spectrum sensing in MIMO cognitive radio networks with CSI uncertainty.	channel state information;cognitive radio;coherence (physics);cross-correlation;eigenvalue perturbation;kaplan–meier estimator;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;mimo;mathematical optimization;perturbation theory;sensor;simulation;tucker decomposition	Adarsh Patel;Bhishm Tripathi;Aditya K.

With the channel state information (CSI) available only at the receiver side, the minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based ordered successive interference cancellation is employed for detection with either forward or reverse ordering. When the channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter, separate channels are obtained via singular value decomposition (SVD) of the channel matrix. The post processing SNR for each stream is fed back to the transmitter to adapt the modulation level corresponding to each stream. The multi-user diversity gain due to scheeduling is observed to be very significant especially without power control. The SE gain from the SVD scheme becomes negligible in a high SNR region which would not justify the complexity of having the CSI at the transmitter. The proportional fair scheduling is a good choice to compromise SE and fairness when the average channel conditions of users are different.	blast;channel state information;crew scheduling;fair-share scheduling;fairness measure;interference (communication);mimo;mean squared error;modulation;multi-user;proportionally fair;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;singular value decomposition;spatial multiplexing;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput;transmitter	Long Bao Le;Ekram Hossain	2004	2004 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (IEEE Cat.

For such a system, however, the important phenomenon of phase transition has received little attention in the literature. In this paper, we study the phase transition on the target detection probability of a SNR maximizing detector. Such a detector declares a target to be present when the largest eigenvalue of the observed data matrix exceeds a threshold. In particular, we identify a critical value below and above which the limiting detection performance is described by the Tracy-Widom law and the Gaussian law, respectively. Under both laws, the scaling limits and asymptotic expansions of misdetection probability at the vanishing regime are derived using tools from random matrix theory.	image scaling;mimo;mathematical model;radar;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;two-phase commit protocol	Lu Wei;Zhong Zheng;Alfred Hero;Vahid Tarokh	2016	2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)	10.1109/ITW.2016.7606853	electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Metrics	49.63052858159688	86.55996505904979	58735

We study the impact of RX IQ imbalance on noise, and derive the maximum-likelihood algorithm to acquire the imbalance parameters, which is decoupled from transmitter IQ imbalance, channel response, and carrier offset. Also, the proposed method has low computational complexity and meets the low-power and low-cost requirements of 60 GHz systems. Moreover, the jitter performance of the estimation reaches the corresponding Cramer–Rao lower bound under a wide range of imbalance parameters.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;low-power broadcasting;network packet;overhead (computing);received noise power;requirement;systems design;transmitter	Changming Zhang;Zhenyu Xiao;Bo Gao;Li Su;Depeng Jin	2014	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-013-1397-0	cramér–rao bound;telecommunications;maximum likelihood;statistics	Metrics	52.59458748695079	79.09433303737254	58740

The complex exponential basis expansion model (CE-BEM) is used to approximate the time-varying multi-path fading channel. In this BEM, the time-varying channel is viewed as a bank of time-invariant FIR filters and the time-variation is captured by means of time-varying complex exponential basis functions. Based on the Gaussian approximation, exact expressions for the a-priori, a-posteriori and extrinsic information are derived for QPSK modulation. The MC system is implemented using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). The performance of the proposed turbo equalization schemes are evaluated using numerical simulations.	approximation algorithm;basis function;boundary element method;finite impulse response;mean squared error;modulation;multiplexing;numerical analysis;simulation;time complexity;time-invariant system;turbo equalizer	Imad Barhumi	2012	2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)	10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310692	turbo code;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;channel code;telecommunications;numerical analysis;computer science;finite impulse response;control theory;gaussian process;mathematics;statistics;approximation theory	Robotics	48.434570584087076	75.2140213989276	59230

457e055193b7e88ed51d28d3d060d512882963f9	generalized subband-filtered and pulse-shaped multicarrier for quasi-synchronous uplink access		In this paper, a new subband-filtered and pulse-shaped multicarrier (SBF-PS-MC) scheme is introduced and investigated in a generalized framework. The main motivation behind is to capture inter-user quasi-synchronicity (QS) and channel spread in 5G massive machine-type communication (mMTC) use case where uplink (UL) synchronization and other control procedures need to be simplified or even dropped to reduce signaling/protocol overhead. Based on downlink synchronization, UL transmissions from geographically distant users can entail severe relative symbol time and carrier frequency offsets by fractional amounts of multicarrier (MC) symbol interval and subcarrier spacing, respectively (i.e., interuser QS). SBF-PS-MC scheme can take advantage both of subband filtering and pulse shaping, whereby, on the one hand, other-subband (or other-user) interference (OBI) is effectively suppressed by subband filtering and, on the other hand, intra-subband and inter-symbol interference is reduced and OBI even further mitigated by pulse shaping. A main contribution is to provide a generalized framework for SBF-PS-MC scheme to handle each of the interference terms analytically dependent on the used subband filter and prototype pulse. Eventually, SBF-PS-MC is numerically evaluated over inter-user QS in time and delay spread channel that per-subband average signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of SBF-PS-MC is superior to those of conventional cyclic prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), weighted overlap-add OFDM, universal filtered OFDM, and subband-filtered OFDM.	2.5d;carrier frequency;frequency divider;interference (communication);multiplexing;noise shaping;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);overlap–add method;prototype;pulse shaping;roll-off;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signaling protocol;slater-type orbital;sub-band coding;subcarrier;synchronicity;telecommunications link;waveform	Wooram Shin;Giyoon Park;Gerhard Wunder;SeungKwon Baek;Joonhyuk Kang	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292657	filter (signal processing);real-time computing;cyclic prefix;pulse shaping;pulse (signal processing);computer science;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;communication channel;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;delay spread	Arch	47.86344421894694	82.90675941932241	59476

However, the benefits of such approach can be realized only when proper channel information is available at the transmitter. Since the amount of the channel information required by the transmitter is large with so many antennas, the feedback is arduous in practice, especially for frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. This paper proposes channel feedback reduction techniques based on the theory of compressive sensing, which permits the transmitter to obtain channel information with acceptable accuracy under substantially reduced feedback load. Furthermore, by leveraging properties of compressive sensing, we present two adaptive feedback protocols, in which the feedback content can be dynamically configured based on channel conditions to improve the efficiency.	channel state information;compressed sensing;duplex (telecommunications);feedback;frequency divider;futures studies;mimo;many antennas;overhead (computing);prospective search;quantization (signal processing);transceiver;transmitter	Ping-Heng Kuo;H.

Unless the coherence interval is large, coherent communication, which requires explicit channel estimation and tracking prior to detection, incurs training overhead which may be excessive, especially for multiple-antenna communication. In contrast, noncoherent detection may be viewed as a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) which jointly estimates the channel and the data, and hence does not require separate training. The main results in this paper are as follows 1) We develop a “signal space” criterion for signal and code design for noncoherent communication, in terms of the distances of signal points from the decision boundaries. 2) The noncoherent metric thus obtained is used to guide the design of signals for noncoherent communication that are based on amplitude/phase constellations. These are significantly more efficient than conventional differential phaseshift keying (PSK), especially at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Also, known results on the high-SNR performance of multiple-symbol demodulation of differential PSK are easily inferred from the noncoherent metric. 3) The GLRT interpretation is used to obtain near-optimal lowcomplexity implementations of noncoherent block demodulation. In particular, this gives an implementation of multiple symbol demodulation of differential PSK, which is of linear complexity (in the block length) and whose degradation from the exact, exponential complexity, implementation can be made as small as desired.	amplitude-shift keying;block code;channel state information;coherence (physics);elegant degradation;key (cryptography);overhead (computing);pre-shared key;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;time complexity	Dilip Warrier;Upamanyu Madhow	2002	IEEE Trans.

Unlike narrowband OFDM, the UWB-OFDM spectrum can have gaps between subcarriers. The modified sigma-delta modulator, dubbed N-Tone sigma-delta, introduces N zeros at the frequencies in the quantization noise spectrum. These zeros match the locations of frequencies used by the OFDM system and the quantization noise spectrum fills the gaps in the spectrum of the UWB-OFDM signal. In fact this new structure could be used in other UWB systems anytime we have gaps in the spectrum of the transmitted signal. We describe both the transmitter and receiver structures for UWB-OFDM. We also study the spectrum of the underlying system.	delta-sigma modulation;transmitter	Ebrahim Saberinia;Ahmed H.

For this scheme, we derive the maximum likelihood (ML) estimators for the UL and DL subspaces, formulate the corresponding Cramér–Rao bounds, and show the asymptotic efficiency of both (singular value decomposition (SVD) based) estimators by means of Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we illustrate how to compute the underlying (rank-1) SVD with quadratic time complexity by employing the power iteration method. To enable power control for the data transmission, knowledge of the channel gains is needed. Assuming that the UL and DL channels have on average the same gain, we formulate the ML estimator for the uplink channel vector norm, and illustrate its robustness against strong noise perturbations by means of simulations.	duplex (telecommunications);frequency divider;loopback;monte carlo method;power iteration;simulation;singular value decomposition;telecommunications link;time complexity	Stefan Wesemann;Thomas L.

Theoretically, one of the main concerns in an RF power amplifier design is the nonlinear effect of the amplifier. Quantitatively, no explicit relationship or expression currently exists between the out-of-band emission level and the nonlinearity description related to the third-order intercept point (IP/sub 3/). Further, in experiments and analysis, it was discovered that, in some situations, using IP/sub 3/ only is not accurate enough to describe the spectrum regrowth, especially when the fifth-order intercept point (IP/sub 5/) is relatively high compared to the third-order intermodulation. In this article, we analyze the nonlinear effect of an RF power amplifier in CDMA (IS-95 standard), TDMA (IS-54 standard) and MIRS M-16-QAM (Motorola MIRS standard) system, give an expressions of the estimation of the out-of-band emission levels for each system expressed by power spectrum respectively, in terms of the IP/sub 3/ and the IP/sub 5/, as well as the power level of the signal.

Interference suppression is important for the UWB devices to operate over spectrum occupied by narrowband systems. In this paper, the use of a notch filter in time-hopping impulse radio (TH-IR) for UWB communication is considered, where a Gaussian monopulse is employed with pulse position modulation. Lognormal channel fading is assumed, and a complete analytical framework is provided for the performance evaluation of using a transversal-type notch filter to reject narrowband interference (NBI). A closed-form expression of bit-error probability is derived, and the numerical results show that the use of a notch filter can improve the system performance significantly. Furthermore, a performance comparison between TH-IR and multicarrier code-division multiple-access (MC-CDMA) UWB systems is made under the conditions of the same transmit power, the same data rate, and the same bandwidth.

Due to the high cost and power consumption of mixed-signal devices in mmWave systems, the hybrid analog and digital precoding transceiver architecture has recently received considerable attention. In this paper, we fully deploy spatial structure of mmWave channel to find hybrid precoders with near-optimal performance and reduce the number of feedback bits. MmWave MIMO channel exhibits the block sparsity structure because of the limited number of scattering clusters with low angular spreads. Consequently, we formulate hybrid precoders design as a block-sparse reconstruction problem and a lower complexity algorithm for finding precoders is proposed based on the greedy sequence clustering. To assure the performance of this algorithm, a estimation method for the number of the blocks and radio frequence (RF) chains is proposed. Under this framework, for the analog precoder the number of the phases needed to be quantized is only two times minus one of that of all blocks, which remains unchanged even the number of RF chains increases. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve the near-optimal performance and save the feedback overhead by utilizing the block sparsity information.	mimo;sparse matrix	Xuefeng Liu;Weixia Zou	2018	Physical Communication	10.1016/j.phycom.2017.12.001	real-time computing;mimo;architecture;wireless;extremely high frequency;computer science;precoding;electronic engineering;transceiver;communication channel	Networks	43.37010562507652	86.0245626422456	60005

ICA based technique is based on independence of source signals and these conditions are satisfied in multi-user CDMA environment. Combining an ICA element to conventional signal detection reduces multiple access interference (MAI) and enables a robust, computationally efficient structure.

The conventional approach to obtain an analytical expression for the average error probability (bit or symbol) relies on finding the joint probability density function (PDF) of the channel and the channel estimate, and then, average the conditional error probability over the joint PDF. Usually, averaging the conditional error probability requires solving a three-fold integral. We will first give a simple proof to the asymptotic Gaussianity of the Intercarrier Interference (ICI), then we show that by expressing the channel in terms of the channel estimate, the problem of obtaining the average error probability is greatly reduced, and simplified to solving a single integral. The derived expressions are general, and may be used to analyze the performance of a variety of channel estimation schemes for OFDM systems in static and time varying channels.	catastrophic interference;channel state information;computer simulation;frequency response;ici (programming language);multiplexing;portable document format;statistical interference;x.690	Mishal Al-Gharabally;Pankaj Das	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.255488	probability density function;telecommunications;mathematics;error exponent;statistics	EDA	39.70118729936132	76.55634929273944	60546

However, since mobile terminals (MTs) need to estimate and feed back channel state information (CSI) related to several cooperative base stations (BSs), reductions in CSI feedback overhead and delay are more demanding in MCP enabled networks. In this paper, a novel overlaid-pilot based CSI feedback scheme for multicell cooperative networks is proposed. MTs directly overlay the received downlink pilot data of all the cooperative BSs on the uplink pilot data and then broadcast it to the cooperative BSs. Each cooperative BS can recover multiple CSIs from the overlaid pilot by a presented overlaid-pilot based channel estimation algorithm. Because the overlaid pilot is fed back on the uplink pilot channel, no extra uplink channel is occupied and the downlink CSI feedback process is with zero-overhead regardless of the number of cooperative BSs. In addition, as it just needs one broadcast to feed back multiple CSIs to BSs, the feedback delay is decreased significantly. Numerical simulations show that the performance of the proposed CSI feedback scheme outperforms the traditional feedback scheme.	algorithm;backchannel;channel state information;ici (programming language);interference (communication);overhead (computing);positive feedback;simulation;telecommunications link	Qinyan Jiang;Tianpeng Yuan;Xiaofeng Tao;Qimei Cui	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343299	telecommunications link;telecommunications;statistics;computer network	Mobile	41.88485827158441	83.51912312807417	60887

To increase the channel capacity, we consider exploiting the polarisation information and send two different signals simultaneously at the same direction, same frequency, but with different polarisations. These two signals can also be considered as one composite signal using the four dimensional (4-D) modulation scheme across the two polarisation diversity channels. In this paper, based on cross-dipole arrays, we formulate the design to find a set of common weight coefficients to achieve directional modulation for such a composite signal and examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

It is shown that LAS DS-CDMA exhibits a significantly better performance than the family of traditional spreading sequences used in a quasisynchronous DS-CDMA scenario having a low number of resolvable multipath components and a sufficiently high number of RAKE receiver branches. The benefits of LAS codes in ad hoc networks are multifold: (i) Their performance is noise-limited, rather than interference-limited, provided that the multipath and multi-user interference arrives within their interference free window. (ii) Under the same conditions LAS codes are robust against the ‘near–far’ effects imposed by ad hoc networks operating without base-station-aided power control, without accurate synchronisation and without implementationally complex interference cancellers.	bit error rate;code;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);multi-user;multipath propagation	Xiang Liu;Hua Wei;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2007	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com:20050549	wireless ad hoc network;synchronization;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;computer network	Mobile	42.68501922019421	75.44353668904105	61005

In order to overcome the channel variation due to fading, we consider exploiting short observation interval and applying the Viterbi algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation due to this short interval. Our simulation results shows that the proposed detection scheme outperforms not only multiple symbol differential detection but also coherent detection with channel estimation under fast fading conditions. In addition, we easily extend the proposed detection scheme to an iterative version by simply incorporating a priori information from the channel decoder. It is also shown that this iterative method improves the performance as the number of iterations increases.	block code;viterbi algorithm	Ye-Hoon Lee;Dong-Ho Kim	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24082-9_17	soft output viterbi algorithm;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;iterative viterbi decoding	Crypto	47.12625918714156	75.39535286030888	61175

In its system, several spreading sequences (bi-orthogonal sequences) are used in a code shift keying basis. Hence, design of the spreading code synchronization system has been an issue in the M-ary bi-orthogonal SS systems. In this paper, the authors focus on a code tracking system using a differential detector and a Delay Lock Loop (DLL). They investigate a tracking performance of their code tracking system by theoretical analysis. In addition, a multi-stage interference canceler is applied to the M-ary bi-orthogonal SS system. As the result, it is shown that the tracking performance of the theoretical analysis is almost the same as that of computer simulations in a multi-user environment. It is also shown that the multi-stage interference canceler is effective in improvement of the BER performance.	tracking system	Junya Kawata;Kouji Ohuchi;Hiromasa Habuchi	2011	IEICE Transactions		jitter;telecommunications;computer science	OS	45.5561282879005	76.69702361333904	61346

EVM is modelled as independent Gaussian noise, which is sent together with the original signal by the transmitter. A simplified self-interference cancellation model at the full-duplex receiver is considered. It suppresses the self-interference via three-stage processing. The stages are antenna isolation, RF cancellation and digital baseband cancellation. It is assumed that the self-interference caused by the EVM noise can be suppressed only by the first two stages. The self-interference caused by the original signal can be also suppressed by baseband processing because it can be estimated in digital baseband of the receiver. The analysis is performed by comparing the rate regions and the transmission power efficiencies of the corresponding half-duplex and full-duplex links.	baseband;computer simulation;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;noise (electronics);numerical analysis;performance per watt;radio frequency;time-sharing;transmitter	Wei Li;Jorma Lilleberg	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952125	telecommunications	Mobile	45.96118693162089	83.7181711325557	61499

The traditional view on how to enable CSIT has been as follows so far: In time-division duplexed (TDD) systems, uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) channel reciprocity allows for the use of a training sequence in any given uplink slot, which is exploited to obtain an uplink channel estimate. This estimate is in turn recycled in the next downlink slot. In frequency-division duplexed (FDD) systems, which lack the UL and DL reciprocity, the CSIT is provided via the use of a dedicated feedback link of limited capacity between the receivers and the transmitter. In this paper, we focus on TDD systems and show that the traditional TDD CSIT acquisition fails to fully exploit the channel reciprocity in its true sense. In fact, we show that the system can benefit from a combined CSIT acquisition strategy mixing the use of limited feedback and that of a training sequence. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in terms of improved CSIT quality under a global training and feedback resource constraint.	beamforming;channel state information;downtime;ergodicity;feedback;mimo;multi-user;multiplexing;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;test-driven development;transmitter	Umer Salim;David Gesbert;Dirk T.

539721820cf799815fccead376d7329613f84236	analog transmission of correlated sources over fading simo multiple access channels		Joint source-channel coding for discrete-time analog sources is an appealing transmission approach because of its extremely low delay and complexity. When the users access the channel orthogonally, analog transmission of correlated information over fading multiple access channels (MACs) using modulo-like mappings provides better performance than uncoded transmission. In this paper, we propose a simplified decoder for modulo mappings in possibly non-orthogonal MAC scenarios with a single-antenna users and a multiple-antenna receiver. Sphere decoding is investigated to reduce the computational complexity when the number of users is large. In addition, affordable strategies are proposed to optimize the mapping parameters according to the channel conditions and the source correlation. The obtained results show that the use of modulo mappings is suitable when the number of antennas at the receiver is larger than the number of users and for high correlation between user data.	analog transmission;channel capacity;computational complexity theory;forward error correction;modulo operation	Pedro Su&#x00E1;rez-Casal;Óscar Fresnedo;Luis Castedo;Javier Garc&#x00ED;a-Fr&#x00ED;as	2017	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2695197	coding (social sciences);fading;electronic engineering;analog transmission;decoding methods;computer science;encoding (memory);computational complexity theory;modulo;communication channel	Mobile	44.13274096925164	79.68561232545397	61626
c5dd2e0a094274a30cef7eea54504a217367bc2b	spatial correlation based csi feedback reduction in dual-polarized massive mimo system		In this paper, a joint antenna selection and two- stage precoding scheme is proposed to reduce the channel state information (CSI) feedback in dual- polarized massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. The proposed scheme can exploit the polarization resource and the spatial correlation from both sides of the transceiver to acquire more accurate CSI with low feedback. First, an antenna selection algorithm is proposed in the pilot training stage to select the least spatially correlated BS antennas, and the acquired partial CSI can be averaged for the CSI of remaining antennas. Both the dimension of the effective uplink channel and the number of necessary radio frequency chains can be reduced. Then, by grouping the spatially correlated users, the two-stage precoding algorithm further divides each CSI coefficient in the effective uplink channel into two categories. Long- term CSI can be reported less frequently while short-term CSI feedback can also be reduced in half due to the isolation between orthogonal polarized directions. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can enhance both the achievable rates and the energy efficiency of the system.	channel state information;coefficient;coefficient of determination;cooperative mimo;feedback;jaccard index;polarization (waves);radio frequency;selection algorithm;simulation;telecommunications link;transceiver	Shulun Zhao;Zhimin Zeng;Fangfang Liu;Chunyan Feng	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)	10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403600	selection algorithm;topology;computer science;real-time computing;mimo;spatial correlation;channel state information;telecommunications link;precoding;transceiver;communication channel	Mobile	41.042806324623946	85.44469313835229	61629

In this paper, an AdaptiveRegularized Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit (ARCoSaMP) algorithm is proposed. Unlike anterior greedy algorithms, the new algorithm can achieve the accuracy of reconstruction by choosing the support set adaptively, and exploiting the regularization process, which realizes the second selecting of atoms in the support set although the sparsity of the channel is unknown. Simulation results show that CS-based methods obtain significant channel estimation performance improvement compared to that of conventional preamble-based methods. The proposed ARCoSaMP algorithm outperforms the conventional sparse adaptive matching pursuit (SAMP) algorithm. ARCoSaMP provides even more interesting results than the mostadvanced greedy compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP) algorithm without a prior sparse knowledge of the channel.	approximation algorithm;calcium-sensing receptor;channel state information;choose (action);compressed sensing;filter bank;gibbs sampling;greedy algorithm;least squares;matching pursuit;mike lesser;modulation;multipath propagation;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;simulation;sparse matrix;time complexity;x.690	Han Wang;Wencai Du;Lingwei Xu	2016		10.3390/s16070966	greedy algorithm;text mining;telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;theoretical computer science;data mining;compressed sensing;statistics	Mobile	50.863740283656895	80.35938055784393	61704

OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) system has been studied a lot as the method to transmit high speed data in wireless visible light communication system. However, OFDM system has drawbacks which are non-linear distortion by high PAPR characteristic and ICI problem occurred by RF impairments. In wireless visible light communication system, output power of visible light which is generated by driven current of LED (light emission diode) has non-linear characteristic. Therefore, transmitted signal is distorted by it. Researches for receive performance of visible light output which is emitted by non-linear LED transfer function and OFDM signal have been studied. In this paper, we suggest a new PAPR reduction technique to reduce non-linear distortion of LED for reducing the PAPR. Also, we propose an adaptive ICI suppression algorithm in order to improve receive performance through enhanced SNR (signal to noise power ratio) by an adaptive channel estimation method of proposed algorithm. Improved performance of proposed system is verified through computer simulation.	algorithm;channel state information;computer simulation;diode;distortion;frequency divider;ici (programming language);linear model;modulation;multiplexing;noise power;nonlinear system;performance per watt;power architecture platform reference;radio frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;transfer function;x.690;zero suppression	Sang Burm Ryu;Jae Hoon Choi;Junyeong Bok;HuiKyu Lee;Heung-Gyoon Ryu	2011	2011 4th IFIP International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security	10.1109/NTMS.2011.5720581	computer simulation;telecommunications;computer science;transfer function;light-emitting diode	EDA	47.496873268003164	81.80336157790846	62111

But the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is the major setback for OFDM systems demanding expensive linear amplifiers with wide dynamic range. In this article, we introduce a low-complexity partial transmit sequence (PTS) technique for diminishing the PAPR of OFDM systems. The computational complexity of the exhaustive search technique for PTS increases exponentially with the number of sub-blocks present in an OFDM system. So we propose a modified Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm with novel mutation, crossover as well as parameter adaptation strategies (MDE_pBX) for a sub-optimal PTS for PAPR reduction of OFDM systems. MDE_pBX is utilized to search for the optimum phase weighting factors and extensive simulation studies have been conducted to show that MDE_pBX can achieve lower PAPR as compared to other significant DE and PSO variants like JADE, SaDE and CLPSO.	algorithm;amplifier;brute-force search;computational complexity theory;differential evolution;digital data;dynamic range;jade;multiplexing;particle swarm optimization;power architecture platform reference;simulation	Saurav Ghosh;Subhrajit Roy;Swagatam Das;Ajith Abraham;Sk.

2ad1ef5a0566dddd5219d770ef1ba483b1cc9cb9	elimo: eliminating channel feedback from mimo		MIMO beamforming provides high throughput for WiFi networks, but it also leads to high computation and communication overhead due to Channel State Information (CSI) feedback. Explicit CSI feedback provides high beamforming gains, but it introduces extremely high overhead. Implicit CSI feedback has low overhead, but it provides very low beamforming gains. We propose EliMO to completely Eliminate CSI feedback from MIMO without sacrificing beamforming gains. EliMO uses two-way channel estimation to allow WiFi Access Points (AP) to accurately estimate downlink CSI without explicit CSI feedback. To measure downlink CSI at the WiFi AP, the WiFi station (STA) puts the received signal of downlink training symbols into Feedback Training Field (FTF) and sends it back to the AP. The AP estimates the two-way channel using the received signal of FTF. Analysis and experiment results show that EliMO is able to provide as high beamforming gains as explicit CSI feedback and as low overhead as implicit CSI feedback. EliMO significantly reduces computation and communication costs of measuring and sending CSI feedback for smart devices, like smartphones, smartwatches, and wireless drones. We evaluate the throughput and energy consumption of EliMO by experiment measurements in both static and mobile scenarios. Evaluation results show that EliMO provides 5× and 4× throughput as implicit and explicit CSI feedback, espectively. Energy consumption of EliMO is only 85%/30% of that of implicit/explicit CSI feedback.	activity recognition;beamforming;channel state information;chipset;computation;matlab;multi-user mimo;online and offline;overhead (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;smart device;smartphone;smartwatch;telecommunications link;throughput;tracing (software)	Yongsen Ma;Gang Zhou;Shan Lin	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)	10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2017.7947004	mimo;channel state information;throughput;wireless;telecommunications link;real-time computing;beamforming;computer science;communication channel;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	43.554037679818215	83.91574501055598	62134

In practice, it may be beneficial to have a constant overall DFT-spread-OFDM/OFDM symbol time, which is the sum of the duration of a CP and the duration of a data portion. We propose to adapt the CP duration to the delay spread without changing the overall symbol time for DFT-spread-OFDM or OFDM, and address implementation challenges. In particular, we propose changing the clocking rate of ADC and DAC or using a Farrow filter to reduce the computational complexity of arbitrary-size DFT/IDFT resulting from the adaptation.	approximation;clock rate;computational complexity theory;harris affine region detector;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;spectral efficiency	Liangping Ma;Tao Deng;Alpaslan Demir	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504182	symbol rate;electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;interference	Mobile	47.42569579516782	81.11933901926629	62138

A general analytical framework is developed for modeling the multiple access interference (MAI) in low-duty systems that is substantially complicated than analysis of more commonly known DS-code division multiple access (CDMA). Using Rake receiver with maximal ratio combining (MRC), we are able to produce a simple error rate expression for general number of combined paths. The theoretical results are then used for performance evaluation and comparison of the two systems. Results show that in multiple access environment, a DS/TH system may gain many fold performance improvement as compared to a DS system.	frequency-hopping spread spectrum;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);maximal set;performance evaluation;rake;ultra-wideband	Mohammad Azizur Rahman;Shigenobu Sasaki;Shahi Taphsir Islam;Masaru Asai;Hisakazu Kikuchi;Hiroshi Harada;Shuzo Kato	2008	2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699710	additive white gaussian noise;time-hopping;code division multiple access;nakagami distribution;telecommunications;word error rate;computer science;probability of error;ultra-wideband;interference;radio receiver;signal-to-noise ratio;spread spectrum;fading;maximal-ratio combining;rake receiver	Arch	40.90210156627877	76.435873486923	62195

This system has lower processing complexity as compared with the existing TAS schemes with maximal-ratio combining and selection combining (TAS/SC) at the receiver. The performance of the TAS/SECPS system with different modulation schemes over independent and nonidentically distributed Rayleigh fading channels is examined. The expressions of average output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and symbol error rate (SER) are derived and validated by simulation. It is shown that the proposed TAS/SECPS is able to achieve similar average output SNR and SER performance as compared with TAS/SC when the predetermined SNR threshold is optimized. Moreover, the TAS/SECPS requires less number of channel estimates.	ampersand;maximal set;modulation;postselection;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;thermal-assisted switching;transmitter	Beng Soon Tan;Kwok Hung Li;Kah Chan Teh	2013	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2013.2243172	transmitter;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;radio receiver;modulation	Mobile	41.37917884035466	76.45130475534357	62236

In this paper, an approach of using time division multiplexing (TDM) with a MIMO receiver to reduce the power consumption and cost of the multiple antenna RF chains is proposed and evaluated. By using the TDM technique, our proposed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM-MIMO receiver reduces the number of RF chains from N to 1, which significantly reduces the overall cost and size of the MIMO receiver. Finally simulation results show that the simple MIMO receiver almost can provide the same diversity gain as the diversity gain of the multiple RF chain MIMO systems.	frequency divider;mimo;multiplexing;rf modulator;radio frequency;simulation	Bong-Jun Kim;Sung-Kyu Kim;Sung Wook Yoon;Heung-Gyoon Ryu;Seung Hwan Lee;Dong-Jin Shin	2014	2014 14th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2014.7011857	3g mimo;statistical time division multiplexing;electronic engineering;real-time computing;multi-user mimo;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;spatial multiplexing;time-division multiplexing;mimo	Arch	42.17734493347479	84.17316591828607	62247

We focus on the following two problems. The first issue is the threshold setting. Traditional methods to set the threshold are reasonable but based on heuristics. We propose a new threshold based on the analytical expression of the channel impulse response (CIR) in the DCT domain. The second issue is the leakage estimation for DCT-based channel estimators. Recently, we have proposed the leakage estimation for discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based channel estimators. It is well known that there is the channel leakage in the high frequency region of the DCT domain, and the leakage causes the error floor. In order to eliminate the error floor, we propose to estimate the leakage in the high frequency region. Simulation results show that the DCT-based channel estimator with the proposed threshold achieves better performance and the error floor is mitigated after leakage estimation.	committed information rate;discrete fourier transform;discrete cosine transform;error floor;heuristic (computer science);multiplexing;regular expression;simulation;spectral leakage;subcarrier	Xin Xiong;Bin Jiang;Xiqi Gao;Xiaohu You	2013	2013 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing	10.1109/WCSP.2013.6677065	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;control theory	EDA	48.994979007980476	80.38201542525039	62421

To estimate the MIMO channel, a standard least mean square (LMS) algorithm was often applied to adaptive channel estimation because of its low complexity and stability. The sparsity of the broadband MIMO channel can be exploited to further improve the estimation performance. This observation motivates us to consider adaptive sparse channel estimation (ASCE) methods using sparse LMS (ASCE-LMS) algorithms. However, conventional ASCE methods have two main drawbacks: (i) sensitivity to random scaling of training signal and (ii) poor estimation performance in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. The former drawback is tackled by proposing novel ASCE-NLMS algorithms. ASCE-NLMS mitigates interference of random scale of training signal and therefore it improves its algorithm stability. It is well-known that stable sparse normalised least-mean fourth (NLMF) algorithms can achieve better estimation performance than sparse NLMS algorithms. Therefore the authors propose an improved ASCE method using sparse NLMF algorithms (ASCE-NLMF) to improve the estimation performance in low SNR regime. Simulation results show that the proposed ASCE methods are shown to achieve better performance than conventional methods, that is, ASCE-LMS by computer simulations. Also, the stability of the proposed methods is confirmed by theoretical analysis.	algorithm;channel state information;computer simulation;image scaling;interference (communication);least mean squares filter;mimo;mean squared error;signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix	Guan Gui;Fumiyuki Adachi	2014	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2013.0665	mathematical optimization;least mean squares filter;computer science;control theory	ML	50.958568351742	80.12251179993068	62608

Selection is performed from a set of NR available relay nodes each equipped with two antennas and outer convolutive coding is used to improve performance. A near-optimum detection scheme is used at the destination node for overcoming the effects of imperfect synchronization among selected relay nodes. End-to-end simulation results show that the employed detection scheme can effectively eliminate the interference components induced by asynchronism with low detection complexity. Furthermore, the one-bit feedback scheme and relay selection technique can enhance the overall system performance and outperform previous feedback methods. © VDE VERLAG GMBH.	relay	Walid M.

In CDD, cyclically delayed copies of the same signals are transmitted from potentially multiple transmit antennas. However, CDD frequency-diversity approach results in poor multi-user frequency-selective scheduling performance for low mobility users. In this paper, we describe an adaptive cyclic delay diversity (ACDD) scheme that can overcome the shortcomings of CDD for low mobility users. In ACDD, the delay values for signals from multiple transmit antennas are adaptively selected based on the user channel profile and velocity. The proposed approach provides enhanced multi-user frequency-selective scheduling performance for low mobility users while keeping the benefit of frequency-diversity for high mobility users.	cdd;multi-user;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);simulation;velocity (software development)	Farooq Khan;Cornelius van Rensburg	2006	IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VTCF.2006.56	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;operating system;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	40.97530194197733	83.96330547199507	63041

The RF signal power reduction and phase variation caused by the high optical power are investigated by experimentation in CA-VLC system.	distortion;interference (communication);modulation;radio frequency;vlc media player	Hyun-Seung Kim;Sang-Kook Han	2013	2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2013.6766024	materials science;electronic engineering;telecommunications;optoelectronics;optical transistor;optical performance monitoring;optical modulation amplitude;optical cross-connect;optical communications repeater	EDA	40.68500292360643	79.7777186471558	63088

An optimal precoder, with the objective to minimize the estimation errors of the AoAs, is first derived. However, to compute the optimal precoder requires the channel state information (CSI) exclusive of the receiver array, which cannot be separately estimated practically. A more feasible precoder design approach, which leverages on the feedback instantaneous CSI estimated at the receiver, is next proposed. Using the ideal optimal design to benchmark the performance, our simulation shows that the proposed practical precoder can achieve near-optimal performance, and both can achieve about 4-6 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to the case when only MUSIC algorithm is applied without precoding. Finally, the performance of the AoA estimator under channel estimation errors is studied through simulation, to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach.	algorithm;angle of arrival;benchmark (computing);channel state information;optimal design;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Xiang Lin;Yong Huat Chew;Lawrence Wai-Choong Wong	2011	2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6139710	algorithm design;estimation;speech recognition;angle of arrival;optimal design;multiple signal classification;channel state information;signal-to-noise ratio;precoding;statistics	Mobile	41.70844425427086	86.93842776432291	63395
a8b92989e1613f6432bb0e651fd2c193ccebf883	joint automotive radar-communications waveform design		The paper studies the problem of waveform design for a joint Radar-Communications (RadComms) system in an automotive setting characterized by a multitarget environment. The envisaged joint waveform allows exploitation of existing infrastructure to support additional functionalities. In this contribution, an automotive radar employing Phase Modulated Continuous Waveform (PMCW) is considered wherein, the transmission of communications bits is additionally facilitated. Particularly, the RadComms system is enabled by the transmission of Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) communications symbols, each symbol modulated by the PMCW sequence. Further, the receiver processing includes demodulation of the communication symbols in addition to the extraction of the radar parameters — range, Angles of Arrival (AoA) and Doppler returns of the targets. In particular, FFT and subspace-based methods are proposed for estimating the radar parameters which are subsequently used in the demodulation of the communication symbols using diversity combining techniques. The performed study demonstrates the impact of the joint set-up on the two systems. It also highlights the effect of system parameters on the performance of receiver algorithms and the trade-off between the FFT and sub-spaced based processing.	algorithm;bit error rate;channel (communications);doppler effect;fast fourier transform;modulation;radar;simulation;waveform	Sayed Hossein Dokhanchi;Bhavani Shankar;Yogesh Anil Nijsure;Thomas Stifter;Saeid Sedighi;Björn E.

Improved flexibility is crucial to cater diverse service requirements. This letter proposes a novel waveform design scheme that exploits axis warping to enable peaceful coexistence of different pulse shapes. A warping transform manipulates the lattice samples non-uniformly and provides flexibility to handle the time–frequency occupancy of a signal. The proposed approach enables the utilization of flexible pulse shapes in a quasi-orthogonal manner and increases the spectral efficiency. In addition, the rectangular resource block structure, which assists an efficient resource allocation, is preserved with the warped waveform design as well.

MC — CDMA is the best candidate for the fourth generation of mobile communications. Many works present techniques to reduce the PAPR like the Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS), Selected Mapping (SLM), Clipping and Filtering and so on, but all are either increases the system complexity or reduce the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance. In this paper, we proposed a technique that is easy to implement and enhance the BER performance at the same time. The key idea of this method is based on a phase changing transform. We have used the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) as a phase re — distributor which consequently will reduce the PAPR at the same time it will enhance the Walsh — Hadamard spreading code when it is not fully loaded. Simulation results show good enhancement with respect of PAPR and the BER approximately doesn't affected without increasing the complexity.	bit error rate;clipping (computer graphics);code;computation;fast fourier transform;hadamard transform;itil;point of view (computer hardware company);power architecture platform reference;simulation;x.690	Montadar Abas Taher;Jit Singh Mandeep;Mahamod Ismail;Hussain Falih Mahdi	2011	The 17th Asia Pacific Conference on Communications	10.1109/APCC.2011.6152895	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;mathematics	EDA	46.36544755239001	81.23473237222476	63611

In this paper we characterize the performance of MMSE MIMO receivers in the limit of large antenna numbers in the presence of channel correlations. Using a different approach, we generalize our results obtained in [1] to correlated channels showing that the mutual information converges in distribution to a Gaussian random variable whose mean and variance can be characterized analytically. Our results agree very well with simulations even with a moderate number of antennas. We conclude by observing that for a fixed target rate and operating SNR, using a larger number of antennas and with a simple linear MMSE receiver may be a convenient design choice compared to limiting the number of antennas and insisting on more complicated non-linear receivers.	mimo;mutual information;nonlinear system;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Aris L.

Called OWSS pulses, they are generated through a combination of orthogonal wavelet-division multiplexing (OWDM) and spread-spectrum concepts. Specifically, they are derived from the OWDM pulses by spreading them in the wavelet domain, using a suitable family of PN codes. Unlike the pulses used in OFDM, TDMA, and even OWDM, these new pulses have both a wide time support and a wide frequency support. Some of the advantages realized are: (a) single or multiple user capability, (b) inherent frequency diversity for overcoming frequency selective fading, (c) continuously pipelined operation (in contrast to OFDM), and (d) a high bandwidth (BW) efficiency, which is about twice that for DS-CDMA (assuming rectangular chips for DS-CDMA). The target bit rates for this work range from 100 Mbps upwards, in the 5.7 GHz band.	data rate units	Vijay K.

The proposed scheme utilizes W-CDMA system with STBC and a receive array antenna with SBAA processing at the receiver. The received signal is converted into the frequency domain before de spreading and adaptive processing is performed for each subband. A novel SBAA construction is introduced to process W-CDMA signals based on STBC. To improve the performance of the proposed scheme, the evaluation is performed over STBC-SBAA using spreading codes.

We extend some of our recent results on sampling of certain classes of parametric non-bandlimited signals and develop a frequency domain framework that yields high-resolution estimates of all relevant channel parameters by sampling a received signal below the traditional nyquist rate. In particular, we show that the minimum required sampling rate in an UWB receiver is determined by the so-called innovation rate, which corresponds to the number of degrees of freedom of the received UWB signal. Our framework allows for faster acquisition compared to current digital solutions and potentially reduces power consumption and complexity of digital UWB receivers significantly. It is particularly suitable in applications such as ranging or positioning and can also be used for identification of more realistic UWB channel models, where different propagation paths undergo different frequency-selective mitigation.	bandlimiting;channel state information;image resolution;nyquist rate;sampling (signal processing);software propagation;ultra-wideband	Irena Maravic;Martin Vetterli;Kannan Ramchandran	2004	2004 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

The algorithm exploits inherent sparsity of the mmWave channel in the angle of departure (AoD) and arrival (AoA) domain, employs sparse channel sensing protocol, and performs blind CFO compensation and estimation of channel paths in the angular domain. The simulation tests show that the proposed algorithm considerably outperforms the conventional orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based mmWave channel estimation algorithm under different CFO and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Aside from the mmWave channel estimation problem, the algorithm is more generally applicable for greedy sparse recovery problems associated with estimating a sparse vector from measurements impaired by frequency offset.	angularjs;carrier frequency offset;channel state information;compressed sensing;greedy algorithm;matching pursuit;motion compensation;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sparse matrix	Milutin Pajovic;Pu Wang;Toshiaki Koike-Akino;Philip V.

TCH codes possess several properties that allow us to use them efficiently in various applications which includes channel estimation, as we address in this paper. With this objective, several performance results were obtained through simulations which allowed the evaluation of the impact of different pilot power levels and modulations, as well as the comparison of TCH against other conventional pilots. In order to cope with the interference between pilots and data, an iterative receiver with interference suppression was employed for the superimposed pilots method.	channel state information;code;interference (communication);iteration;multiplexing;performance;qr code;simulation;zero suppression	Bruno Lopes;Silvia Catarino;Francisco Cercas;Nuno M.

All base stations (BSs) and mobile stations (MSs) are equipped with multiple antennas. The multiuser interference in such a system is inherently asynchronous due to different path distance of BS to MSs. Theoretically we can at best synchronize the desired signal component but not the interference components. We propose a new precoding design in order to curb the impact of asynchronicity of interference, and the effect of interference is mitigated by introducing second-order statistics of interference into the linear precoding design. It has been shown that the proposed design improves the system performance significantly and outperforms Joint Wiener Filtering scheme consistently.

Further improvement in performance is achieved with codebook based precoders adopted by third generation partnership project (3GPP) for spatial multiplexed transmission mode. Open loop and closed loop precoded spatial multiplexing for fixed and adaptive rank transmissions were simulated and analyzed on the backhaul link of a cooperative MRN system in a high speed train. To obtain improved performance, channel information in the form of precoder matrix indicator (PMI) and rank indicator (RI) are required for the closed loop operation while the RI is only needed for the open loop operation. The results show that throughput gain on the backhaul link of the cooperative MRN system can be achieved with the precoded transmission when compared to unprecoded spatial multiplexing transmission. Further improvement in throughput was achieved when the transmission rank changed dynamically according to the channel condition.	backhaul (telecommunications);closed-loop transfer function;codebook;compaq lte;relay;simulation;spatial multiplexing;throughput	Ayotunde O.

Long training sequences are used to estimate the channel response in the frequency domain, and a scalar Kalman filtering scheme is designed to refine the channel estimation. To track the channel variations during a long burst packet, pilots estimated via vector Kalman filtering are used to interpolate linearly and modify the estimated channel response. Both channel AWGN and state variable noise variance are adaptively estimated. Furthermore, to overcome phase changes across symbols owing to the frequency offset estimation error, a pilot based phase compensation scheme is incorporated. The complete algorithm can be processed in real time with much better performance than training sequence based or pilot based channel estimation methods.

However, recently, another metric known as cubic metric (CM), is being considered in several multicarrier systems since it can predict HPA power de-rating more accurately. In this paper tone reservation (TR) technique, originally used for PAPR-reduction, is reformulated to reduce CM. We first simplify CM to define the objective function, denoted as objective CM (OCM). Then we demonstrate that OCM is convex and formulate TR for CM-reduction as an unconstrained convex optimization problem. The solution to this problem is found by means of an iterative algorithm which approaches the optimal solution with few steps. In this paper a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm capable of approaching the optimum with sufficient accuracy is also proposed. Simulation results show that for similar computational complexity, the performance of CM-reduction is superior to that of PAPR-reduction both in terms of bit error rate and out-of-band leakage.	algorithm;amplifier;bit error rate;bures metric;computation;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;cubic function;delta modulation;iterative method;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;out-of-band agreement;power architecture platform reference;simulation;spectral leakage	Marc Deumal;Ali Behravan;Joan Lluís Pijoan	2011	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2011.042111.070613	convex function;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;convex optimization;computer science;control theory;mathematics;iterative method	Metrics	49.35521068982719	82.16573313722397	64764

A simplified version of BLAST known as V-BLAST has been proposed and implemented. In this paper we compare the performance of various V-BLAST algorithms through computer simulations. The results show that the nonlinear detection schemes with interference cancellation (Ie) have much better performance than linear detection schemes and Minimum Mean Squared Error schemes (MMSE) have better performance than Zero Forcing (ZF) schemes. The efficient square-root algorithm with Ie shows very attractive property that having low complexity while keeping the good performance compared with conventional IC scheme.

Flicker noise is one of the major impairments which severely affects the performance of the system. In this work, we investigate the use of signal processing techniques in the mitigation of flicker noise in OFDM-based systems which employ DCR architecture. The statistical properties of flicker noise are exploited to develop adaptive signal processing algorithms that reduce the effect of flicker noise in DCRs.

The proposed estimator exploits both scattered and continual pilots commonly used in mobile television systems such as DVB-H. Rapid channel estimation and CFO compensation is necessary in order to deal with high mobility, time-slicing and potential handovers during the receiver switch-off time. The proposed method achieves frequency synchronization within a single OFDM block. No extensive time averaging is needed, which makes the approach very attractive for time and frequency selective channels where the CFO may be time varying. It is particularly suitable to burst type of transmission used, for example in DVB-H. Simulation examples are provided within the framework of mobile DVB-H systems.	algorithm;carrier frequency offset;channel state information;coefficient;dvb-h;digital video broadcasting;mobile television;motion compensation;simulation;subcarrier;time slicing (digital broadcasting)	Timo Roman;Visa Koivunen	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378385	intermediate frequency;electronic engineering;real-time computing;broadcast television systems;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;digital television;telecommunications;computer science;digital video broadcasting	Arch	50.344386264138606	77.96018235423323	64939

The perfect feedback requires unlimited resources in the reverse communication link. However, the feedback resources are limited in a practical system. Therefore, there is a trade off between the feedback load and the performance of transmission scheme. In this work, we evaluate the performance of multi user inter cell interference alignment (MUICIA) based transmit precoding scheme in a downlink MIMO system. It has been shown that in a system with unlimited feedback resources, MUICIA outperforms state of the art transmit precoding schemes. Here we assess the gains of MUICIA in a limited feedback uplink which is an important step in realization of this transmission scheme in practical systems. We consider two vector quantization based feedback designs. One is based on random generation of codebooks and the other is based on hierarchical codebooks.	cell (microprocessor);channel state information;closed-loop transfer function;codebook;feedback;futures studies;interference (communication);mimo;mimo-ofdm;multi-user;procedural generation;quantization (signal processing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link;transmission (bittorrent client);transmitter;vector quantization	Danish Aziz;Radoslav Atanasov;Andreas Weber	2014	2014 IEEE 79th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2014.7023047	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;mathematics;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;vector quantization;statistics;mimo	Mobile	39.66440385637431	85.40106312549209	65167

We consider the general case of multiple antenna sensing in the presence of spatially and temporally correlated noise when the PU signal has more than one cyclic frequency. We model and formulate the multiple antenna sensing problem as a composite hypothesis testing problem and use the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) to derive a detector for the general model mentioned above. Then, we also propose the GLRT-based detectors for the two special cases of: 1) spatially uncorrelated but colored noise; 2) spatially white noise. Moreover, in order to calculate the decision threshold, the asymptotic performance of the proposed detectors under the null hypothesis is given. The provided simulation results show the superiority of the performance of the proposed detectors compared to the recently-proposed cyclostationary-based detectors.	cognitive radio;colors of noise;cyclostationary process;mimo;one-class classification;sensor;simulation;white noise	Saeid Sedighi;Abbas Taherpour;Tamer Khattab;Mazen O.

It is well-known that the M-ary CPM signal can be decomposed into the superposition of multiple PAM waveforms. In this paper, we apply the decomposed PAM waveforms for CPM classification through ALRT. However, to detect the CPM signals costs a high complexity because the PAM decomposition method requires multiple filters to match the PAM waveforms. Hence, we propose a new phase detection method which has lower complexity. In addition, we analyze the phase noise in the phase detection method to insure the prerequisite of applying the ALRT approach for modulation classification. Simulation results show that the new M-ary CPM classification method has satisfying probability of correct classification when SNR is beyond 0 dB.	approximation algorithm;matched filter;modulation;phase noise;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Chih-Ping Tsu;Dah-Chung Chang	2011	2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005913	phase detector;continuous phase modulation;probability density function;decomposition method;index term;telecommunications;likelihood-ratio test;computer science;phase modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;phase noise;statistics;satisfiability	Vision	53.455375261707445	82.64521262682491	65266

In an attempt to realize this capacity, Foschini proposed the layered space–time architecture. This scheme was argued to asymptotically achieve a lower bound on the capacity. Another line of work has focused on the design of channel codes that exploit the spatial diversity provided by multiple transmit antennas [2], [3]. In this paper, we take a fresh look at the problem of designing multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems. First, we develop a generalized framework for the design of layered space–time systems. Then, we present a novel layered architecture that combines efficient algebraic code design with iterative signal processing techniques. This novel layered system is referred to as the threaded space–time (TST) architecture. The TST architecture provides more flexibility in the tradeoff between power efficiency, bandwidth efficiency, and receiver complexity. It also allows for exploiting the temporal diversity provided by time-varying fading channels. Simulation results are provided for the various techniques that demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TST architecture over both the diagonal layered space–time architecture in [1] and the recently proposed multilayering approach [4].	algorithm;array processing;blast;code;decibel;forward error correction;information theory;interference (communication);iterative method;layered system;linear algebra;mimo;mathematical optimization;new foundations;performance per watt;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;signal processing;simulation;spectral efficiency;ternary search tree;trellis quantization	Hesham El Gamal;A.

Conventional timing estimation methods, which take advantage of the correlation property of a given preamble, always experience performance degradation in multipath fading channels with severe channel dispersion. To achieve accurate timing estimation, the authors propose a robust threshold-based timing detection method independent of the preamble structure. Based on the autocorrelation and cross-correlation, a novel timing metric with an extended correlation length is proposed to mitigate noise and resist large carrier frequency offsets. Due to the superior statistical property of the proposed timing metric, the threshold can be easily determined with no need for the process of noise variance estimation. Simulation results under different multipath fading channels demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a remarkably improved timing accuracy compared to the existing methods.	autocorrelation;carrier frequency;cross-correlation;elegant degradation;frequency divider;motion estimation;multipath propagation;multiplexing;simulation	Li Zhen;Hao Qin;Bin Song;Rui Ding	2016	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2015.1136	telecommunications;cross-correlation;mathematics;statistics	EDA	50.69909003528658	78.44815737340123	65411

Different stepped time interval pulse trains (STIPT) which are orthogonal are designed for spatially separated transmitting nodes. Because of the good autocorrelation and cross-correlation properties, mutual interference becomes weaker and signals from different stations can be separated entirely. Furthermore, the proposed approach can reduce distance side lobe and the highest peak to side lobe ratio increases obviously, so the pulse integration can enlarge the detection range greatly. Another advantage is that the proposed approach is compatible to conventional radars and can also be applied to the upgrade of the radars Simulation results show its good performance.	acoustic lobing;autocorrelation;computer;cross-correlation;interference (communication);radar;simulation;transmitter	Lianqing Fu;Lisheng Yang;Haiyong Wu;Chen Su;Qiu Wu	2012	JCP	10.4304/jcp.7.4.858-862	radar engineering details;telecommunications;pulse-doppler radar;pseudorandom noise;radar display;low-frequency radar	Mobile	46.483079207396244	84.00667773488485	65722

This carefully designed coding scheme, called cyclic odd bit inversion length 16 (COBI-16), meets all the following three essential criteria: (a) no spikes in the frequency spectrum, (b) low complexity correlation operations and (c) simple frequency offset and DC compensation operations. The scheme is tested in both AWGN and Rayleigh fading (flat and frequency selective) channels. Both coherent and non-coherent demodulations are investigated.

The primary objective of the proposed algorithm is to increase the overall throughput while ensuring the mean bit error rate (BER) is below a specified limit. To achieve this, spatial diversity is employed to improve the subcarrier signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. Simultaneously, (uniform or non-uniform) bit allocation, which is a function of subcarrier SNR, is performed to increase throughput. To reduce power consumption, spatial processing complexity, and hardware costs, antenna subset selection is also performed by the proposed algorithm to choose a set of active transmit/receive antennas. The results show that combining bit allocation with spatial diversity (employing antenna subset selection) can yield substantial throughput increases.	algorithm;bit error rate;computational complexity theory;markov chain;radio frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;subcarrier;throughput;transceiver;x.690	Alexander M.

In this paper, we extend ASM to spectrum sharing systems in an effort to improve the secondary system's performance in terms of energy efficiency and ASE. Based on a limited feedback from the primary user (PU), the secondary transmitter (ST) uses power adaptation in order to maximize its ASE while respecting a peak interference constraint to the PU. When compared to the recently-proposed fixed power scheme (FPS), the adaptive power scheme (APS) proposed in this paper offers lower transmission delays, higher effective throughput, and comparable error performance. In this work, we analyze the performance of APS in terms of ASE, effective throughput, and average bit error rate (ABER). We also provide several simulations through which we corroborate these analytical results.	adaptive server enterprise;bit error rate;cognitive radio;floating point systems;ibm systems network architecture;image scaling;interference (communication);mimo;modulation;simulation;spectral efficiency;throughput;transmitter	Zied Bouida;Ali Ghrayeb;Khalid A.

An a posterioriprobability (APP) algorithm for CPM is developed based on the classic APP algorithm for channel codes. The system is analyzed through upper bounds on the average bit error probability. For coded and interleaved minimum shift keying, the weight spectrum is computed, resulting in a transfer function bound. This is cumbersome for a general CPM system; instead, only the most significant error events contributing to the weight spectrum are identified. Simulations show that, firstly, these events give a satisfactory view of system performance when equal outer codes are used, and secondly, that remarkably good performance can be obtained for some simple systems. Finally, power spectral densities and bandwidths are computed, allowing for a bandwidth/performance comparison of different combinations.	algorithm;bit error rate;computer simulation;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;iteration;key (cryptography);modulation;transfer function	Pär Moqvist;Tor Aulin	2001	IEEE Trans.

2b9a343625d16a78df0d30bca00a152b045965a1	multiuser media-based modulation for massive mimo systems		Media-based modulation (MBM) is an attractive modulation scheme which is getting increased research attention recently. In this paper, we consider MBM for the uplink of a massive MIMO system, which has not been reported before. Each user is equipped with one transmit antenna with multiple radio frequency (RF) mirrors (parasitic elements) placed near it. The base station (BS) is equipped with tens to hundreds of receive antennas. We investigate the potential performance advantage of multiuser MBM (MU-MBM) in a massive MIMO setting. Our results show that multiuser MBM (MU-MBM) can significantly outperform other modulation schemes. For example, a bit error performance achieved using 500 receive antennas at the BS in a massive MIMO system using conventional modulation can be achieved using just 128 antennas using MU-MBM. Even multiuser spatial modulation and generalized spatial modulation in the same massive MIMO settings require more than 200 antennas to achieve the same bit error performance. Also, recognizing that the MU-MBM signal vectors are inherently sparse, we propose an efficient MU-MBM signal detection scheme that uses compressive sensing based reconstruction algorithms like orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP), and subspace pursuit (SP).	algorithm;basis pursuit denoising;bit error rate;channel state information;compressed sensing;detection theory;mbm (file format);mimo;matching pursuit;modulation;multi-user;openmp;radio frequency;sampling (signal processing);sparse matrix;telecommunications link	Bharath Shamasundar;Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam	2017	2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227731	compressed sensing;modulation;mimo;matching pursuit;detection theory;electronic engineering;telecommunications link;subspace topology;computer science;base station	Mobile	45.720266846783325	79.81522680828698	66609

The eigenvalue based detection (EbD) algorithm has received broad attentions, since it shows significant robustness to the noise uncertainty problem. However, in EbD algorithm, it is quite difficult to obtain the distribution for the eigenvalues of the statistic covariance matrix, causing the false alarm or detection probability fail to be controlled efficiently. To this end, in this paper, we reinvestigate the eigenvalues from the perspective of the circulant matrix and propose a power spectrum density (PSD) based detection (PbD) algorithm. The proposed algorithm not only shares the same principle as the EbD algorithm, but also its error probability can be calculated efficiently. The closed-form expressions for the sensing threshold and the detection probability of our PdD algorithm are also provided. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis well.	algorithm;circulant matrix;cognitive radio;new star games;simulation;spectral density	Zhe Sun;Weijia Han;Yuquan Li;Yan Zhang;Meilu Lin	2013	2013 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing	10.1109/GlobalSIP.2013.6737114	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;spectrum of a matrix;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	49.53122088753269	86.6325726138764	66622

This paper presents a purely analytical approach to PER prediction for rate-compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) with bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) MIMO OFDM systems based on the analysis of pairwise error probability (PEP) and the transfer functions of the codes.

An old result that rich scattering in MIMO propagation environments is a requisite for the channel matrix to have full rank (equivalently for the channel capacity to scale linearly with the number of antennas) is verified. Then, novel insights on the importance of scattering in MIMO channels from a graph-theoretical perspective are provided. By showing that the adjacency matrix of the whole propagation channel has same spectrum (eigenvalues) as the sub-graph inter-connecting the scatterers, it is inferred that all graph-theoretical properties of the propagation graph are contained in the scattering fraction of the channel. In particular, it is inferred that the channel model can be almost-surely reconstructed from the sole knowledge of the spectrum of the sub-graph interconnecting the scatterers. These results may find application in MIMO channel modeling in settings where full pilot-based channel estimation is infeasible or impractical, as in high-mobility scenarios.	adjacency matrix;channel (communications);channel capacity;channel state information;graph theory;level of detail;mimo;software propagation	Oussama Souihli;Tomoaki Ohtsuki	2013	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2012.120312.121184	telecommunications;graph theory;mathematics;spectral graph theory;precoding;channel capacity;computer network	Networks	43.44948818219911	85.18228780326275	66864
8bb54ea14183a9ba58f52febe43e3a46e08fd686	a novel carrier waveform inter-displacement modulation method in underwater communication channel		As the main way of underwater wireless communication, underwater acoustic communication is one of the foc uses of ocean research. Compared with the free space wireless com munication channel, the underwater acoustic channel suffersfrom more severe multipath effect, the less available bandwidthand the even complex noise. The underwater acoustic channel is one o f the most complicated wireless communication channels. To achi eve a reliable underwater acoustic communication, Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulation and Passive Time Reversal Mirror (PTRM) equalization are considered to be a suitable scheme. Howeve r, due to the serious distortion of the received signal caused b y the channel, this scheme suffers from a high Bit Error Rate (BER) under the condition of the low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). To solve this problem, we proposes a Carrier Waveform InterDisplacement (CWID) modulation method based on the Linear Frequency Modulation (LFM) PSK and PTRM scheme. The new communication scheme reduces BER by increasing the differe nce from the carrier waveform for different symbols.

In this paper, we extend the existing research to an optimal GLRT based cooperative spectrum sensing scheme in a heterogeneous network scenario, where each node can be equipped with different number of antennas and have different signal processing capacity, such as sampling rate. By considering the discrepancy of different secondary user nodes' sensing reliability due to different hardware configuration, we demonstrate that the optimal cooperative spectrum sensing scheme based on GLRT is a linear combination of each node's local test statistic. Moreover, the local test statistic is the logarithm of the arithmetic-to-geometric mean ratio of the eigenvalues associated with the sample covariance matrix. Furthermore, the optimal combining coefficient is a simple function of the numbers of the antennas and the received signal samples at each secondary user node, which can be intrinsically provided by each secondary user node without any prior information. Numerical results show that the proposed GLRT based cooperative spectrum sensing scheme performs better than the practical ED based scheme, i.e., equal gain combination based ED, especially under the case where the sensing reliability discrepancy of each secondary user node is significant.	coefficient;discrepancy function;jaccard index;original chip set;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;whole earth 'lectronic link	Jun Luo;Qiang Li;Shaoqian Li	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks	10.1109/DYSPAN.2012.6478162	electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	49.9506395049129	86.54941890724312	67232

In the 3GPP protocol, the frequency offset in the mid-speed and low-speed modes is not processed, and the frequency offset processing algorithm in the high-speed mode only applies to the case where the Doppler frequency offset does not exceed the unit sub-carrier. For solve the problem, a three-step improvement method is proposed. The first step is to perform the maximum likelihood (ML) offset estimation to do the frequency offset correction; the second step is to perform the sliding average filter processing to eliminate the influence of multipath; the third step is to use multiple sliding window peak detection algorithm. Compared with the traditional algorithm, the performance of the proposed method is better. And the false alarm performance under the AWGN channel is at least 3.8 dB better, and the false alarm performance under ETU channel is at least 1 dB better.

Considering that mobility is an essential property of wireless networks, we analyze the detection performance of soft-decision sensing by mobile SUs. Then, a data fusion rule is proposed aiming at mobile CRNs. Unlike conventional rules, ours needs no a prior information, which makes it more applicable and more suitable to mobile CRNs since prior information like SNR or each SU's location is not available when SUs keep moving. Finally, we analyze the performance of our rule and illustrate its superiority compared to conventional ones. Simulations show that our rule increases detection probability, decreases miss detection probability and error probability on condition that false alarm probability keeps the same, compared with equal gain combination (EGC).	coefficient;cognitive radio;computer simulation;essence;loss function;numerical analysis;one-class classification;optimization problem;signal-to-noise ratio;stationary process;superuser	Xinyu Wang;Min Jia;Qing Guo;Xuemai Gu	2015	2015 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2015.7413957	mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;probability of error;data integration;mathematical model;signal-to-noise ratio;computer security;measurement;statistics	Mobile	47.94929781319104	87.66237783854673	67409

The channel measurements are taken from an outdoor urban multiple input multiple output (MIMO) measurement campaign. Moreover, ABER performance results using simulated Rayleigh fading channels are provided and compared with a derived analytical bound for the ABER of SM, and the ABER results for SM using the measured urban channels. The ABER results using the measured urban channels validate the derived analytical bound and the ABER results using the simulated channels. Finally, the ABER of SM is compared with the performance of spatial multiplexing (SMX) using the measured urban channels for small and large scale MIMO. It is shown that SM offers nearly the same or a slightly better performance than SMX for small scale MIMO. However, SM offers large reduction in ABER for large scale MIMO.	bit error rate;mimo;modulation;rayleigh fading;smx (computer language);spatial multiplexing	Abdelhamid Younis;William Hedley Thompson;Marco Di Renzo;Cheng-Xiang Wang;Mark A.

However, carrier frequency offset (CFO), which is mainly due to oscillator mismatches and/or Doppler shift, will destroy the orthogonality among subcarriers and introduce intercarrier interference (ICI) as well as multiple-access interference (MAI) in uplink scenario. Thus, system performance will be seriously degraded. To overcome this problem, it is of great importance to do research on suppression of the interferences caused by CFO. In this paper, we proposed a novel time domain inverse matrix receiver to suppress the interference of multiple CFOs. Compared with the conventional frequency domain direct ZF inverse matrix method, which has high complexity in obtaining the ICI matrix and its inverse matrix, the proposed method has very low complexity in obtaining the interference matrix. Furthermore, the signal after interference suppression is a frequency domain signal. Thus the receiver complexity can be simplified. Simulation results show that this algorithm has almost the same performance to the frequency domain direct ZF inverse matrix method.	algorithm;carrier frequency offset;catastrophic interference;data rate units;density matrix;doppler effect;equalization (communications);fast fourier transform;frequency divider;ici (programming language);intelligence amplification;interference (communication);matrix method;reduction (complexity);simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero suppression	Xiupei Zhang;Heung-Gyoon Ryu;J.

However, such a scheme has a bandwidth efficiency that decreases inversely with the number of diversity branches making it less attractive in wireless communications applications. This paper considers combined orthogonal transmitter diversity and multi-level linear modulation techniques. The idea is to view the signal constellations of the modulation scheme in an augmented signal space formed by the modulation signal dimension and the number of branches of the transmitter diversity scheme. This augmented signal space provides a good spread for the modulation signal points and can be quite efficient for high-level linear modulation techniques. The obtained results show that this combined scheme, not only improves the system performance in both additive white Gaussian noise and fading multipath channels, but also improves the bandwidth efficiency of orthogonal transmitter diversity.	additive white gaussian noise;bit error rate;high- and low-level;modulation;multipath propagation;performance per watt;rayleigh fading;simulation;spectral efficiency;transmitter;trellis quantization;utility functions on indivisible goods	Slimane Ben Slimane	2006	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-006-9089-7	antenna diversity;telecommunications;computer science;diversity scheme;computer performance;cooperative diversity;fading;wireless;diversity gain	Mobile	44.02867046835166	79.08140359546323	67699

To decode the transmitted symbols and take advantage of the full multipath diversity that the channel has to offer, computationally complex maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding is often employed. We show that a linear equalizer followed by a hard decision is capable of benefiting from maximum multipath diversity in linearly precoded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, where the information symbols are mapped through a matrix transformation before the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) at the OFDM transmitter. As far as we are aware, this is the first proof of a linear equalization scheme achieving maximum multipath diversity over single-input single-output wireless links. We can conclude from this result that at sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), precoded OFDM systems will perform better over channels with more taps even with linear equalization, due to the increase in diversity order.	codec;decoding methods;distortion;equalization (communications);fast fourier transform;multipath propagation;multiplexing;signal-to-noise ratio;transformation matrix;transmitter	Cihan Tepedelenlioglu	2004	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2003.821987	digital radio;fast fourier transform;transmitter;equalizer;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;antenna diversity;telecommunications;computer science;delay spread;diversity scheme;mathematics;maximum likelihood;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless	Mobile	45.765380463496044	78.67419760924406	67949

The authors consider the generalised-K distribution in order to include both shadowing and small-scale fading effects. Generalised-K distribution is generic and versatile as it can incorporate various composite fading and shadowing effects observed in wireless communication channels with mathematical tractability. The authors derive analytical BER expressions that are functions of band-limited pulse shapes, MTJ parameters and shadowing and fading parameters of the wireless channel. The system incorporates either a Nyquist pulse or a cosine band-limited pulse shape. Numerical results show that the systems with cosine pulse demonstrate better BER performance than the ones with Nyquist pulse in the presence of MTJ. Furthermore, in the presence of MTJ, MMSE-based systems demonstrate improved BER performance as compared to LDW-based systems. The authors also observe that the systems employing two-dimensional scheme, that is, the combination of space and multipath diversity, outperform the ones with multipath diversity scheme.	bandlimiting;bit error rate;decorrelation;discrete cosine transform;k-distribution;mean squared error;multi-user;multipath propagation;numerical method;nyquist rate;radio jamming;sensor;x.690	Haider Mehdi;Kah Chan Teh;Kwok Hung Li	2010	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2009.0824	bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	40.44846752898576	76.62184254709814	68274
66a7f7b89fc518de77623a9f78f0fcd2a7f15513	efficient scheme for channel estimation in ofdm system	channel estimation;mmse;ofdm;ls	The choice of channel estimation is of fundamental importance in OFDM receiver designs, which further involves a trade-off between complexity and estimation accuracy. In pilot-symbol-aided OFDM system, the Least Square (LS) estimator suffers from inherent additive Gaussian noise and Inter Carrier Interference (ICI), although the estimator exhibits lower complexity and requires implicit knowledge of the channel. In comparison, the Minimum Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) estimator shows much better performance than the LS. However, a major drawback of the MMSE is its higher computational overhead, which further grows with increasing the number of pilots. Accordingly, the optimal design of channel estimators has remained an area of ongoing research. This study performs modifications to both existing LS and MMSE algorithms, followed by proposing two new channel estimators, namely Simplified Least Square (SLS) and Simplified Minimum Mean Square Error (SMMSE). Mathematical analyses and simulation results show that the proposed SLS method is more robust against the additive Gaussian noise and outperforms the original LS estimator. Moreover, this method can perform almost similar to the MMSE for a range of SNRs. Meanwhile, in our study the proposed SMMSE method requires only a minimum knowledge of the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) to efficiently estimate the channel. Additionally, the SMMSE exhibits computational complexity to be significantly lower than that of the original MMSE estimator.	algorithm;channel state information;committed information rate;computation;computational complexity theory;ici (programming language);interference (communication);least squares;low-rank approximation;mean squared error;optimal design;overhead (computing);simulation;standard sea level;structured-light 3d scanner;utility functions on indivisible goods	Md.

Based on the experimental results, we clarify the impact of parameter M in the best-M individual method and derive the sub-optimal M value of four, which achieves nearly the best performance irrespective of the PDSCH transmission bandwidth for the target UE when the sub-band bandwidth is 720 kHz in SIMO transmission. Furthermore, we clarify that when M=4 the best performance is achieved also in the MIMO transmission, and that the gain from adaptive sub-band allocation based on the CQI of each sub-band is smaller than that in the SIMO transmission because the CQI of each sub-band is averaged between codewords and receiver antennas.	code word;experimental system;mimo;telecommunications link;throughput	Yoshiaki Ofuji;Naoto Okubo;Sadayuki Abeta;Takehiro Nakamura	2008	2008 IEEE 68th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2008.327	code word;throughput;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications link;channel code;link adaptation;telecommunications;power control;computer science;engineering;phase-shift keying;resource management;interference;bandwidth;computer network;mimo;bandwidth allocation;modulation	Mobile	44.47309620945077	82.21644718769649	68576

A new retransmission structure with a sequence of multiple codebooks is proposed that are optimized for combining gain, rather than using a single identical codebook for every retransmission. Furthermore, a criterion for selecting a pre-coding matrix for each retransmission can be provided so as to minimize the retransmission error probability. Under the proposed multiple codebook structure for MIMO-HARQ systems, a sequence of optimum codebooks is constructed for the subsequent retransmissions. Simulation results are presented for showing that the proposed scheme achieves significant error performance advantages over conventional schemes with a single codebook and furthermore, a near-optimal performance is achieved as the codebook size chosen is large enough.

While SSW is very robust against the additive noise, it suffers from an inherent noise. The noise is resulted from host interference on detection of the embedded hidden information. The host interference is one of the main reasons of relatively low embedding rate in SSW and its reduction is important. In this paper, a new method for SSW detector is proposed to reduce the host interference. The proposed method is based on the law of large numbers and symbol detection of embedded information, instead of bit detection. Since the method is based on the detection of symbols longer than 1 bit, the detector can employ PN sequences with larger length, resulting in decrease of the interference. Symbol error rate using this algorithm is calculated employing maximum a posterior criterion. Comparison of bit error rates between the modified SSW algorithm and conventional bit detection shows that the modified algorithm is much more robust against the host interference.	1-bit architecture;additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;ampersand;bit error rate;embedded system;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;interference (communication);pseudorandom number generator;utility functions on indivisible goods	Saeed Sedghi;Yôiti Suzuki	2007	Third International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing (IIH-MSP 2007)	10.1109/IIH-MSP.2007.256	law of large numbers;bit error rate;telecommunications;digital watermarking;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	EDA	46.99954917500234	75.63435403528284	68729

We call this novel ClR estimation method Time-OfArrival based Blended Least Squares (TOA-BLS) which uses symbol rate sampled signals, and it is based on blending correlation processing followed by TOA estimation in the frequency domain by the least squares based channel estimation. TOA estimation in the frequency domain is accomplished by estimating the AR model parameters by solving the forward and forward-backward linear prediction equations in the least squares sense. Simulation examples are drawn from the ATSC digital TV 8-VSB system [I ] . The delay spread for digital TV systems can be as long as several hundred times the symbol duration; however digital TV channels are sparse where there are only a few dominant multipaths. 1. OVERVIEW OF DATA TRANSMISSION MODEL For the communications systems utilizing periodically transmitted training sequence, least-squares (LS) based channel estimation or the correlation based channel estimation algorithms have been the most widely used two altematives. Both methods use a stored copy of the known transmitted training sequence at the receiver. The properties and the length of the training sequence are generally different depending on the particular communication system's standard specifications. In the sequel, although the examples following the derivations of the blended channel estimator will be drawn from the ATSC digital TV 8-VSB system [ I ] , to the best of our knowledge i t could be applied with minor modifications to any digital communication system with linear modulation which employs a training sequence. We should note that we are not using semiblind techniques (subspace based [6] or IQML[51). Since our main focus is applying this technique in real time on the ATSC Digital TV system which has 10.76 MHz symbol rate [I] , we want as low complexity as possible. Computing eigenvectors, or implementing an iterative search scheme, may be prohibitive in real-time for the very long channel lengths that one has to deal with in Digital TV, which may span up to 500 symbols or so.

The use of OHL enables OAF relaying FSO systems to remove accumulated background noise, which is one of the main factors that limit the system performance. The performance of proposed systems is analytically studied by which closed-form expression for bit-error rate (BER) is formulated, taking into account the effects of atmospheric turbulence channels and noises caused by background radiation and receiver.

6f4cc791b03bd114ab0caa0366ace7965a6f1b5b	a technique to reduce papr for ofdm-im using multiple mapping rules for im		Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with index modulation (IM) (or OFDM-IM) has attracted increasing attention due to its high spectral efficiency as well as high energy efficiency for next generation wireless communication systems. Despite its advantages over OFDM, it also inherits drawbacks of OFDM, e.g., a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) problem. In this paper, we propose a novel PAPR reduction method for OFDM-IM by exploiting the availability of multiple mapping rules for IM. While the proposed approach is similar to the selected mapping (SLM) scheme for conventional OFDM, the main difference is that it is based on multiple mapping rules that are naturally given for IM (thus, this method is not applicable to OFDM). Furthermore, in order to avoid the transmission of side information (of the used mapping rules), a blind search detector that combines a blind search method and a low-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) detector is proposed. From the simulation results, we can observe that the proposed PAPR reduction method for OFDM-IM has a lower computational complexity than that of the SLM method for conventional OFDM, while providing similar or slightly better performances in terms of bit error rate (BER) and PAPR reduction.	algorithm;bit error rate;computation;computational complexity theory;frequency divider;modulation;multiplexing;performance;power architecture platform reference;simulation;spatial light modulator;spectral efficiency;transmitter;x.690	Hanseong Jo;Yonggu Lee;Sangin Jeong;Jinho Choi	2018	2018 IEEE 87th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2018.8417535	modulation;electronic engineering;maximum likelihood;computer science;detector;bit error rate;computational complexity theory;spectral efficiency;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing	HPC	45.64992431826672	80.45541429200823	69095

The use of clipping and filtering techniques (which can be repeated several times) was shown to be an effective way of reducing the PMEPR of DS-CDMA signals. We consider an improved receiver where there is an iterative estimation and cancelation of nonlinear distortion effects. The proposed receiver allows significant performance improvements after just a few iterations, even when we have strong nonlinear distortion effects.	amplifier;clipping (computer graphics);code;distortion;filter (signal processing);iteration;nonlinear system;requirement;transmitter	Rui Dinis;Paulo Silva	2009	2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks	10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235357	transmitter;telecommunications;computer science	EDA	47.730168844276605	78.89994542852311	69178

The proposed scheme is to change the metric calculation adaptively to the channel SNR, grounded on the fundamental relationship between the detection capability and the bit-error rate (BER) performance with respect to the channel SNR. An efficient hardware architecture implementing the proposed scheme is also presented to show its applicability in a practical sense and it is proven that the architecture induces only a negligible hardware overhead compared to the state-of-the-art MIMO symbol detector. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can indeed increase the detection capability effectively without degrading the BER performance noticeably.	bit error rate;mimo;overhead (computing);sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;throughput;x.690	Byeong Yong Kong;In-Cheol Yong Park	2013	2013 IEEE 77th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2013.6691858	detector;throughput;electronic engineering;real-time computing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;hardware architecture;signal-to-noise ratio;measurement;statistics;mimo	Mobile	44.797029976300244	80.49857158667335	69188

The desired signal is corrupted by N interfering sources apart from additive white Gaussian noise. The channel is Rayleigh fading. As a result, the channel matrix for the desired signal and the propagation vectors of the interferers have zero-mean complex Gaussian entries; the entries are assumed to be independent and identically distributed. The complex receive weight vector used for combining the received signals is chosen so as to maximize the output signalto-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). From the statistics of the channel matrix and the propagation vectors of the interferers, we derive a closedform expression for the probability density function (p.d.f.) of the maximum output SINR. This p.d.f. can be used to obtain the symbol error probability for various digital modulation schemes.	additive white gaussian noise;interference (communication);modulation;rayleigh fading;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;software propagation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Parag A.

One of such kind of systems is called DPC-OF/TDMA (dynamic parameter controlled orthogonal frequency and time division multiple access) which targets at beyond 100 Mbps data rate. In order to support higher data rates, e.g., several hundreds of Mbps or even Gbps for future wireless multimedia applications (e.g., streaming video and file transfer), it is necessary to enhance DPC-OF/TDMA system based on MIMO-OFDM (multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) platform. In this paper, we propose an enhanced DPC-OF/TDMA system based on Multi-Layer MIMO-OFDM scheme which combines both diversity and multiplexing in order to exploit potentials of both techniques. The performance investigation shows the proposed scheme has better performance than its counterpart based on full-multiplexing MIMO-OFDM scheme. In addition to the Exhaustive Detection (EXD) scheme which applies the same detection algorithm on each subcarrier independently, we propose the Reduced-Complexity Detection (RCD) scheme. The complexity reduction is achieved by exploiting the suboptimal Layer Detection Order and subcarrier correlation. The simulation results show that huge complexity can be reduced with very small performance loss, by using the proposed detection scheme. For example, 60.7% complexity can be cut off with only 1.1 dB performance loss for the 8 × 8 enhanced DPC-OF/TDMA system.

78bdd349a73dd4873692603f906fb5d8e2365733	efficient joint estimation and compensation of cfo, tx/rx frequency-selective i/q imbalance, and the mimo radio channel in ofdm systems		MIMO OFDM is a very promising technique for future wireless communication systems. By applying direct conversion architecture, low-cost, low-power, small size, and flexible implementation of MIMO OFDM systems can be realized. However, the performance of direct conversion architecture-based MIMO OFDM systems can be seriously affected by RF impairments incling carrier frequency offset (CFO) and I/Q-imbalance. While OFDM is sensitive to CFO, direct conversion architecture is sensitive to I/Q imbalance. SuchRF impairments aggravate as the carrier frequency becomes higher for example, beyond 60GHz. To achieve the desired high performance ofMIMOOFDM, suchRF impairments have to be compensated for. In this paper, the joint compensation of CFO, transmitter and receiver frequency-selective I/Q imbalance, and the MIMO radio channel is investigated. Two preamblebased schemes are proposed for impairment parameter estimation. The proposed preambles are constructed both in time and frequency domains and require much less overhead than the state-of-the-art designs. Furthermore, much lower computational complexity is allowed, enabling efficient implementation.The advantages and effectiveness of both proposed schemes are compared and verified by numerical simulations and complexity analysis.	analysis of algorithms;carrier frequency;coefficient;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;estimation theory;finite impulse response;frequency offset;iteration;low-power broadcasting;mimo;mimo-ofdm;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);rf modulator;rx microcontroller family;radio frequency;softswitch;systems design;toeplitz hash algorithm;transmitter	Jian Luo;Wilhelm Keusgen;Andreas Kortke	2013	J.

The loss of orthogonality among the subcarriers will degrade the system performace, and this effect is named intercarrier interference (ICI). In this paper, a Wiener-based successive interference cancellation (SIC) scheme is proposed to detect the OFDM signals. It provides good ICI cancellation performance; however, it suffers large computation complexity. Therefore, a modified Wienerbased SIC scheme is further proposed to reduce the computation complexity. Simulation results show the performance of the Wienerbased SIC scheme is better than those of zero forcing, zero forcing plus SIC and original Wiener-based schemes. Furthermore, with the modified Wiener-based SIC scheme, the performance is still better than the others. Although the performace of the modified Wiener-based SIC scheme suffers little degradation compared to Wiener-based SIC scheme, the computation complexity can be dramatically reduced.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;bell laboratories layered space-time;catastrophic interference;channel state information;computation;elegant degradation;frequency divider;ici (programming language);interference (communication);mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;rayleigh fading;sic-povm;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simplified instructional computer;simulation;subcarrier;wiener filter;x.690;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Jyh-Horng Wen;Yung-Cheng Yao;Ying-Chih Kuo	2013	Comput.

7807d14b577af88d752df402c9fe5f3fefe716b5	a 2-d fft-based transceiver architecture for oam-ofdm systems with uca antennas		"""Radio orbital angular momentum (OAM) provides another perspective of spatial multiplexing to improve the spectrum efficiency. However, multipath induces severe intra- and interchannel crosstalk. To solve the problem in a uniform circular array (UCA)-based OAM system, we first incorporate the effect of sign changing of OAM reflection in modeling the multipath OAM channel. Then, we propose a transceiver architecture for broadband OAM orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless communication systems, which uses baseband digital 2-D fast Fourier transform (FFT) rather than existing radio frequency analog phase shifters to generate and receive the OAM-OFDM signal, thus reducing energy consumption and hardware cost. At last, a flexible 2-D FFT algorithm is developed. Analysis and simulation results show that compared with the traditional row–column FFT algorithm, the proposed 2-D FFT algorithm could reduce the multiplication complexity by <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\frac{1}{4}MN\log _2N$</tex-math> </inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$N$</tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$M$</tex-math></inline-formula> are the number of UCA antenna elements and the number of subcarriers, respectively."""	angular momentum operator;angularjs;baseband;crosstalk;fast fourier transform;molecular orbital;multipath propagation;object access method;radio frequency;simulation;spatial multiplexing;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;transceiver;unicode collation algorithm	Rui Chen;Wenhai Yang;Hui Xu;Jiandong Li	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2817230	fast fourier transform;multipath propagation;spatial multiplexing;electronic engineering;transceiver;computer science;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;baseband;spectral efficiency;multiplexing	Mobile	46.277148500214345	83.19889636777071	69656

In particular, we assume massive antenna arrays in which the number of antennas in a RRH is much larger than the number of active users. The proposed method consists of two phases: dimensionality reduction phase and individual quantization phase. The key idea of the first phase is to apply principal component analysis (PCA). It performs low-rank approximation of a matrix - composed of received signals - by exploiting the correlation of the received signals across space and time. In the second phase, our method individually quantizes the dimensionality-reduced signal by applying transform coding with bit allocation to reduce the number of quantization bits. An LTE link-level simulator provides numerical results which show that the method achieves up to 8 × compression ratio for the uplink with 64 antennas and 4 active users, along with improvement in communication system performance as a result of denoising.	baseband;compaq lte;dimensionality reduction;low-rank approximation;noise reduction;numerical analysis;principal component analysis;remote radio head;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;transform coding;uncompressed video	Jinseok Choi;Brian L.

The IRC receiver is typically based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criteria, which requires highly accurate channel estimation and covariance matrix estimation that includes the inter-cell interference. To do this, the channel estimation and covariance matrix must be averaged within a subframe, i.e., 1 msec. However, the source of the inter-cell interference is changed within one subframe of the covariance matrix estimation due to the change in the user allocation at the interfering cells if asynchronous networks are employed. This affects the performance gain of the IRC receiver. This paper investigates the impact on asynchronous networks and the gain from the IRC receiver in terms of the downlink user throughput performance. Simulations results based on a 57-cell model environment, i.e., a cellular environment in the LTE-Advanced downlink, show that the IRC receiver which has two antenna branches effectively suppresses the inter-cell interference even when asynchronous networks are employed.	asynchronous i/o;channel state information;compaq lte;computer simulation;elegant degradation;interference (communication);internet relay chat;mean squared error;rejection sampling;telecommunications link;throughput	Yusuke Ohwatari;Nobuhiko Miki;Tetsushi Abe;Hidekazu Taoka	2012	2012 IEEE 75th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240127	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;co-channel interference;radio receiver	Mobile	43.04360744930609	82.6085045512305	70067
8d91eba1d4339c5b85885c25eee8d93e0a0ace51	power allocation for multicell mixed-adc massive mimo systems in rician fading channels		This paper investigates the achievable uplink spectral efficiency (SE)of a massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems with a mixed analog-to-digital converter (ADC) receiver architecture, in which some antennas are equipped with costly full-resolution ADCs while others are equipped with cheap low-resolution ADCs. We derive the theoretical results and corresponding approximate expressions of the achievable SE in single cell systems and multicell systems. Based on approximated results, analysis demonstrates that the achievable SE is decided by the transmit power, the number of antennas, the proportion of full-resolution ADCs and quantization precision of the low-resolution ADCs. Especially, we propose the power allocation algorithms based on the lower bound and upper bound of approximate achievable SE for multicell systems with Riean fading channel and MRC detector. Simulation results show that the total achievable SE improves by increasing the number of BS antennas, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the quantization precision. Moreover, by comparing the total achievable SE for the proposed power allocation algorithms and the equal power allocation algorithm, results showcase that proposed power allocation algorithms remarkably improve the total achievable SE, which verifies the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.	analog-to-digital converter;approximation algorithm;cobham's thesis;fractal antenna;mimo;memory management;quality of service;quantization (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Mengjiao Zhang;Weiqiang Tan;Junhui Gao;Xi Yang;Shi Jin	2017	2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171074	fading;computer science;real-time computing;transmitter power output;mimo;quantization (signal processing);telecommunications link;rician fading;electronic engineering;upper and lower bounds;spectral efficiency	EDA	41.63455385116375	86.98847450916035	70325

Instead of direction estimation of the frequency response on each subchannel, an interpolation filter is used on the pilot symbols to estimate a smaller set of coefficients that are sufficient to characterize the multipath channel. The actual frequency responses on the subchannels are then computed through inverse filtering of these coefficients. Because the same amount signal energy is used to estimated a reduced set of unknowns, the estimation accuracy is improved. The scheme is well suited for packet-based communication systems where pilot symbols instead of pilot tones are usually used at the beginning of packet for fast synchronization and channel estimation.	channel state information;coefficient;digital subchannel;frequency response;interpolation;inverse filter;multipath propagation;network packet;simulation	Haiyun Tang;Kam Y.

Based on the signature vector formulated for each user, a new user detector is proposed. It is shown that when matched filtering is employed to suppress MAI in the proposed detector, under imperfect power control, strong users can severely degrade the performance of its neighboring users. To improve the system performance, we derive a subspace zero-forcing and a subspace MMSE MAI suppression scheme for the proposed detector. We show that only the knowledge of the desired user's CFO is required in MAI suppression and the system can be rendered almost MAI-free provided that the CFO estimation is accurate enough.	frequency divider;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);zero suppression	Shengwei Hou;Chi Chung Ko	2006	IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VTCF.2006.187	zero forcing equalizer;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;power control;computer science;engineering;control theory;computer performance;matched filter	Mobile	47.626224843243904	78.94140728147708	70572

They all originate from the set-membership filter (SMF). Our algorithms have some advantages over traditional adaptive algorithms. First, They provide region estimates in addition to point estimates. Second, they exhibit better convergence due to the optimization of the weighting sequence. Third, our algorithms feature a unique selective update criterion that requires parameter updates to be computed for only a small fraction of the data. Simulation shows our algorithms are superior to other blind algorithms in serious near-far effect.	algorithm;multi-user;set theory	Qiang Zheng;Xufeng Zheng;Chengshu Li	2002		10.1109/PIMRC.2001.965419	randomized algorithms as zero-sum games;mathematical optimization;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;telecommunications;resource management;point estimation;mathematics;statistics	Theory	48.84844011033497	75.22693979546335	70588
04329569c6cf9292b0b4f5cf73e7ba00d29a7dce	iterative gfdm receiver based on the paratuck2 tensor decomposition		Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) is one of the multi-carrier transmission techniques considered as an alternative to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for 5G wireless communication systems. GFDM is a flexible multi-carrier scheme that spreads the data symbols in a time-frequency block. Compared to OFDM, in GFDM each subcarrier is additionally filtered with a circular pulse shaping filter. Tensor algebra efficiently describes multidimensional signals, preserves their structure and provides improved identifiability. Moreover, in the past communication systems have been modeled using tensor algebra and often showed a tensor gain compared to matrix based receivers. Therefore, we model the GFDM system using tensor algebra and tensor decompositions. In this paper, we present a tensor model for the GFDM transmit signal for single and multiple antennas based on the PARATUCK2 decomposition. Furthermore, based on this model we design an iterative receiver that simultaneously estimates the channel and the transmitted data. It significantly outperforms the Least Squares (LS) receiver. The proposed iterative receiver has a comparable performance with the state-of-the-art Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) receivers while having a significantly lower computational complexity.	channel state information;computational complexity theory;download;filter bank;frequency divider;iteration;iterative method;least squares;multiplexing;noise shaping;pulse shaping;subcarrier	Kristina Naskovska;Sher Ali Cheema;Martin Haardt;Bulat Valeev;Yury Evdokimov	2017			mathematical optimization;tensor;mathematics	Mobile	50.18004659305195	81.18270991201557	70711

These “iterated-decision equalizers” use an optimized multipass algorithm to successively cancel ISI from a block of received data and generate symbol decisions whose reliability increases monotonically with each iteration. These equalizers have an effective complexity comparable to the decision-feedback equalizer (DFE), yet asymptotically achieve the performance of maximum-likelihood sequence detection (MLSD). We show that, because their structure allows cancellation of both precursor and postcursor ISI, iterateddecision equalizers outperform the minimum mean-square error DFE by 2.507 dB on severe ISI channels even with uncoded systems. Moreover, unlike the DFE, iterated-decision equalizers can be readily used in conjunction with error-control coding, making them attractive for a wealth of applications.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;download;effective complexity;equalization (communications);error detection and correction;information sciences institute;interference (communication);iteration;nonlinear system	Albert M.

The SC-MLP equalizer is proposed to mitigate the effect of intersymbol interference (ISI) and non-linearity in the system. It is demonstrated that the SC-MLP offers significantly superior bit error rate (BER) performance compared to the complex-valued transversal equalizer and the complex-valued Volterra equalizer in a highly non-linear SI-POF system. For example, for a 10 m SI-POF, a data rate of 15 Gbps is attainable at a BER of 10^-3 with SC-MLP compared to 10 Gbps with the complex-valued transversal equalizer using CAP-64.	bandlimiting;bit error rate;data rate units;distortion;equalization (communications);interference (communication);layer (electronics);lotka–volterra equations;memory-level parallelism;modulation;multilayer perceptron;nonlinear system;optical fiber;quad flat no-leads package;reliability engineering;signal-to-noise ratio;x.690	Isaac N.

The multiuser transmission (MUT) with adaptive antenna arrays for the downlink direction is considered to increase system capacity and to eliminate the multiple-access interference (MAI) and the inter-symbol interference (ISI) of the CDMA system. In this paper, the angular gain of the spatial filter is modeled by a piece-line function to analysis the interference difference between the in-beam users and the out-beam users. Based on this analysis, a lower complexity MUT scheme using spatial classes is proposed for avoiding MUT computation complexity, which can achieve the nearly same performance with the conventional MUT scheme. The bit-error probability approximation of this MUT scheme is also analyzed as well. The simulation result is used to confirm the availability of this lower complexity MUT scheme.	profiling (computer programming)	Zheng Jiang;Yanyan Liao;Yan Zhang;Dacheng Yang;Xin Zhang	2007		10.1109/VETECF.2007.213	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;spatial filter	Vision	42.776404676642635	78.84010428016224	71372

In contrast to a conventional receiver, here, only knowledge of the spreading code and rough timing of the desired user is required. By investigating the code space of the multipath signals and the data vector space, a RAKE filtering vector is developed to extract the desired data from all the paths of the desired user. Our proposed technique not only exploits the characteristics of multipath propagation but also the characteristics of timing offsets that may occur in the receiver, to facilitate the application of a blind linear filter-optimization technique for robust interference suppression. Based on the RAKE filtering vector, interference rejection is implemented by using the auxiliary-vector (AV) technique. Our approach, however, effectively overcomes the sensitivity of the original AV method to multipath propagation and timing offsets. To mitigate the signal cancellation at relatively high signal-to-interference and noise ratios (SINR) resulting from the estimation errors of the RAKE filtering vector, robust strategies are introduced in addition to the linear filter optimization. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.	data point;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-user;multipath propagation;rake;rayleigh fading;rejection sampling;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;zero suppression	Pingan Li;Khaled Ben Letaief	2007	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2007.904404	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;signal processing;linear filter;mathematics;statistics;rake receiver	Visualization	50.22509388007405	74.66484346312158	71511

The method makes use of frequency-domain updating, but time-domain implementation of the canceller. It introduces no delay into the received signal path and presents no special difficulties for interframe interpolation between near-end echo, far-end echo, or far-end data signal. The authors also investigate the fast initialization and the special case of far-end frequency offset in the echo signal. >	echo suppression and cancellation	John M. Cioffi;John A. C.

This increases nonlinear distortion in its wideband power amplifier (PA) because the PA needs to concurrently amplify multi-band signals. By taking higher harmonics as well as interand cross-modulation distortion into consideration, we have developed a method to analytically evaluate the adjacent channel leakage power ratio (ACPR) and error vector magnitude (EVM) on the basis of the PA’s nonlinear characteristics. We devise a novel method for modeling the PA amplifying dual-band signals. The method makes it possible to model it merely by performing a one-tone test, making use of the Volterra series expansion and the general Wiener model. We then use the Mehler formula to derive the closed-form expressions of the PA’s output power spectral density (PSD), ACPR, and EVM. The derivations are based on the assumption that the transmitted signals are complex Gaussian distributed in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission systems. We validate the method by comparing measurement and simulation results and confirm it can appropriately predict the ACPR and EVM performance of the nonlinear PA output with OFDM inputs. In short, the method enables correct modeling of a wideband PA that amplifies dualband signals merely by conducting a one-tone test. key words: nonlinear power amplifier, spectral regrowth, ACPR, EVM, OFDM, complex Gaussian distribution, Flexible Wireless System, Volterra series expansion, general Wiener model	adjacent channel power ratio;audio power amplifier;distortion;frequency divider;input/output;intermodulation;modulation;multiplexing;nonlinear system;norm (social);series expansion;simulation;spectral density;spectral leakage	Ikuma Ando;Gia Khanh Tran;Kiyomichi Araki;Takayuki Yamada;Takana Kaho;Yo Yamaguchi;Kazuhiro Uehara	2013	IEICE Transactions		electronic engineering;complex normal distribution;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;earned value management;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;statistics	ML	42.45888007693945	77.77037990575116	71551

The multiuser interference is firstly derived in the context of single user detection, which reveals that the interference is determined by the modulation format. Therefore, the interference can be successfully suppressed by carefully chosen modulation parameters. Based on this observation, a class of orthogonal multiple access schemes is proposed. It is shown that the proposed strategy not only facilitates simple detection at the receiver side but also offers improved sum rate.	interference (communication);modulation;multi-user	Li Bing;Tor Aulin;Baoming Bai	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037414	adjacent-channel interference;telecommunications;computer science;zero-forcing precoding;euclidean distance;mathematics;interference;phase modulation;co-channel interference;wireless	Mobile	42.80172695441711	78.8240022397141	71589

In practice, an accurate threshold that the technique relies on is difficult to obtain, since optimizing the threshold requires prior knowledge of channel statistics and signal/noise power, which are not always known a priori nor are easy to estimate. In this paper, we propose a new thresholding method that does not rely on such prior knowledge and is robust against an inaccurate threshold.	line-of-sight (missile);multipath mitigation;multipath propagation;noise (electronics);noise power;thresholding (image processing);time of arrival	Chunpeng Yan;H.

The novel scheme is based on embedded pilots that are characterized as virtual users and their number is determined in a dynamic fashion according to the propagation channel conditions. The superimposed code-multiplexed pilots are used initially for channel estimation before the despreading operation, thus achieving per subcarrier estimation using the known unique multi-layer pattern of the virtual users. Afterwards, the estimation is enhanced by using the despread pilots. Furthermore, an iterative scheme is incorporated in channel estimation process minimizing the effect of multiuser interference and operates either in interference cancellation, or in virtual user mode. The proposed architecture is evaluated for spatial diversity systems (space- frequency block coded) with two transmit and up to four receive antennas operating in realistic propagation channels for various modulation and coding schemes. The results demonstrate a significant performance improvement especially as the channel is dominated by its time variant characteristics. The dynamic assignment of spreading codes in the payload and the pilots offers to the system realistic flexibility and adaptivity in demanding channels achieving concurrently maximization of the real overall system throughput, while maintaining low overhead and complexity burden.	channel state information;mimo	Athanasios D.

The excellent performance of this signal was reached by Alternative Binary Offset Carrier (AltBOC) modulation, which is specially designed for high precision range measurement and which is featured by extremely wide bandwidth. However, this modulation presents some drawbacks. The most severe one is the ambiguity problem in AltBOC signal acquisition and tracking, which introduces a large bias in the pseudo-range measurement. In order to solve this problem, an unambiguous tracking method based on a pseudo correlation function for AltBOC(15,10) modulation signal is proposed in this paper. It employs two local signals and a novel combination function, which completely removes side peaks from the correlation function while keeping the sharp main peak. Impacts of multipath on the proposed method are also investigated.

To achieve this, two multiple signal classification (MUSIC)-based algorithms are first addressed to jointly estimate the nominal DOAs and frequency offsets of the incoming rays. The first algorithm is an extension of the classic two-dimensional (2-D) MUSIC, which, however, calls for enormous amount of computations. To alleviate the computational overhead, the second algorithm estimates the nominal DOAs and frequency offsets in a space-frequency-space (SFS) tree structure, in which two S-MUSICs and one F-MUSIC are invoked alternatively to estimate the nominal DOAs and the frequency offsets, respectively. In between every other MUSIC, a spatial beamforming process and a temporal filtering process are employed to decouple the uplink signals from different transmitters, thus enhancing the estimation accuracy. Thereafter, based on the estimated nominal DOAs and frequency offsets, a data detection procedure is also addressed. Simulations show that both algorithms can provide satisfactory performance while the SFS MUSIC calls for substantially lower computational complexity	algorithm;beamforming;clustered file system;computation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;direction of arrival;frequency divider;frequency offset;mimo;mimo-ofdm;music (algorithm);multiplexing;overhead (computing);standard database management analysis;telecommunications link;transmitter;tree structure	Kuo-Hsiung Wu;Wen-Hsien Fang;Jiunn-Tsair Chen	2006	2006 IEEE 63rd Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2006.1683414	statistical classification;electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;mathematics	Visualization	49.72932690862335	78.23713267022467	71752

The algorithm performs simultaneous identification and equalization of a non minimum phase channel from its output only. Simulatioii results, with QAM signals, are presented to demonstrate the ef €ectiveness of POTEA. I. INTRCIDUCTION HIS LETTER introduces a new adaptive algorithm for T blind equalization, based on secondand fourth-order statistics. The only information u priori blind equalizers require about the transmitted signal is related to its statistical properties. As such, they have an obvious advantage over trained equalization techniquq as they avoid long delays and wasted energy associated with training sequences. The new algorithm, named POTEA, belongs to a family of symbol-spaced, blind equalizers that are based on higher-order cumulants, or their Fourier transforms called higher-order spectra (see [l] and references therein). A popular class of blind equalizers are the Busijgang-type techniques (see [l] and references therein) according to which the error quantity e ( i ) used in the tap-weight adaptation law is formed between the output of the equalizer, md a nonlinear transformation of the output signal. Thus the nonlinearity is introduced ufier the blind equalizer. However, in POTEA the nonlinearity is applied on the received signal, before it enters the blind equalizer. The latter approach sxploits statistics of the received signal from the second-order domain (cepstrum of the power spectrum) and the fourth-order domain (cepstrum of the tricoherence function). We concentrate on quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) signals with up to 64 signa points arranged in a squared constellation. Such signals ?.re widely used in digital microwave radio and in voicebsnd modems. High-speed digital radio is subject to severe frequency-selective fading due to the distortion effects of a Inultipath medium. In order to compensate it and increase the reliability of the system by augmenting the margin against noise, intersymbol interference (ISI) and equipment imperfections, it is necessary to employ adaptive equalizers.

The main feature is to use a small matrix of main channel information and recursive calculation of matrix inverse to significantly reduce the complexity, which makes it feasible for low cost OFDM consumer terminals.

However, the time and frequency dispersion of the mobile radio channel leads to the loss of orthogonality which produces intersymbol interference (ISI) and interchannel interference (ICI). Therefore, another requirement on the elementary pulse has to be imposed: the good localization in time and frequency. Based on the characteristics of the mobile radio channel, we design a new pulse to minimize ICI and ISI.	catastrophic interference;elementary;ici (programming language);information sciences institute;interference (communication);internationalization and localization	Ralf Haas;Jean-Claude Belfiore	1997	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1023/A:1008859809455	pulse shaping;nyquist isi criterion;time–frequency analysis;internationalization and localization;telecommunications;computer science;co-channel interference;intersymbol interference	Mobile	49.102794080747024	82.14438914996761	72190

Unlike the traditional binary PNC that focuses mainly on BPSK modulation, the proposed symbol-based PNC is tailored for the general MPSK modulation. In particular, the product of the two modulated signals is considered as a network-coded symbol, which exploit the characteristic of MPSK modulation to compact the solution space of the intended network-coded symbol. Based on the autocorrelation of the received signal at the relay node, a novel PNC-oriented detection scheme is developed to estimate the network-coded symbol for broadcasting. The proposed scheme achieves receive diversity advantage with linear complexity at the relay node. In addition, the proposed scheme can effectively handle information exchanging with asymmetric data rates between the two sources. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms other linear-MIMO detection based counterparts in terms of diversity order, and it also outperforms the existing decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) approaches when dealing with the asymmetric information exchanging.	anisotropic filtering;autocorrelation;direction finding;feasible region;linear logic;linear network coding;mimo;modulation;relay channel;simulation	Ruohan Cao;Tiejun Lv;Hui Gao	2011	2011 - MILCOM 2011 Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2011.6127678	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;relay channel;communication	Vision	43.99564441675124	79.45842705695578	72300

Combination of Raptor code and use of interference cancellation in the resulting Multiple Access Channel (MAC) results in almost perfect removal of the effect of the interfering channel. Thus, the primary channel's performance remains intact. As in the other MAC detection scenarios, for optimal performances, a power difference between the main and interfering transmitters is required. In the case that these two powers are equal, we propose a hard decision stage prior to the decoding at the destination in order to eliminate erased symbols. The proposed technique can also be used for increasing the capacity of forward and/or return links of the DVB Return Channel via Satellite (DVB-RCS).	channel (communications);dvb-s2;digital video broadcasting;electronic circuit;function overloading;interference (communication);performance;primary channel;raptor code;return channel;revision control system;simulation;transmitter	Mohammad Jabbari Hagh;M.

In this paper, we propose to use discrete sine/cosine transforms in place of the DFT for SC-FDMA. Eight SC-FDMA systems based on various DST/DCT types are studied. The bit error rate (BER) and the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) are used to evaluate performance of these eight DST/DCT-based SC-FDMA systems in comparison with the conventional DFT-based SC-FDMA system in an AWGN environment. Simulation results show that the DST/DCT-based SC-FDMA systems with the use of localized FDMA scheme can provide better BER performance and yet keep the same PAPR performance as compared to the DFT-based SC-FDMA system.	modulation	Ling Zhuang;Lu Liu;Jibi Li;Kai Shao;Guangyu Wang	2014	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-014-1819-7	embedded system;bit error rate;daylight saving time;telecommunications;computer science;discrete cosine transform;mathematics	Mobile	46.26690847876641	81.14018784097252	72446

Based on the two-step optimal precoder design algorithm that maximizes the lower bound of the mutual information with finite-alphabet inputs, the proposed method simplifies the precoder design by fixing the right singular vectors of the precoder matrix to be the modulation diversity matrix, eliminating the iterative optimization between the two steps, and discretizing the search space of the power allocation vector. The modulation diversity matrices are designed for different modulations, which outperform the existing maximum diversity for BPSK and 8PSK inputs. For a 4×4 channel, the computational complexity of the proposed precoder design is reduced to 3% and 6% of that required by the original two-step algorithm with Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) and 8PSK, respectively. The proposed method achieves nearly the same mutual information as the two-step iterative algorithm for a large range of SNR region.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;discretization;iterative method;key (cryptography);mimo;mathematical optimization;modulation;mutual information;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Mingxi Wang;Yahong Rosa Zheng;Chengshan Xiao;Weiliang Zeng	2012	MILCOM 2012 - 2012 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415680	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics	EDA	40.849538420380306	88.19895143030567	72495

We exploit the sparse structure of the channel impulse response to improve the performance of the channel estimation algorithm, due to the reduced number of taps to be estimated. The resulting novel algorithm initially estimates the overall sparse channel taps from the source to the destination as well as their locations using the matching pursuit (MP) approach. The correlated non-Gaussian effective noise is modeled as a Gaussian mixture. Based on the Gaussian mixture model, an efficient and low complexity algorithm is developed based on the combinations of the MP and the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) technique, to improve the estimates of the channel taps and their location as well as the noise distribution parameters in an iterative way. The proposed SAGE algorithm is designed in such a way that, by choosing the admissible hidden data properly on which the SAGE algorithm relies, a subset of parameters is updated for analytical tractability and the remaining parameters for faster convergence Computer simulations show that underwater acoustic (UWA) channel is estimated very effectively and the proposed algorithm has excellent symbol error rate and channel estimation performance.	acoustic cryptanalysis;anisotropic filtering;channel state information;computer simulation;consensus dynamics;doppler effect;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency divider;iteration;iterative method;matching pursuit;mixture model;multiplexing;portable document format;relay;sparse matrix	Habib Senol;Erdal Panayirci;Murat Uysal	2014	2014 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)	10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2014.6848994	electronic engineering;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science	Robotics	50.71511755140873	80.45115647024919	72536

To this end, cognitive radio represents a promising technology since it allows to exploit the unused radio resources. In this context, the spectrum sensing task is one of the most challenging issues faced by a cognitive radio. It consists of an analysis of the radio environment to detect unused resources which can be exploited by cognitive radios. In this paper, three different cognitive radio architectures, namely, stand-alone single antenna, cooperative andmultiple antennas, are proposed for spectrum sensing purposes. These architectures implement a relatively fast and reliable signal processing algorithm, based on a feature detection technique and support vector machines, for identifying the transmissions in a given environment. Such architectures are compared in terms of detection and classification performances for two transmission standards, IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.16e. A set of numerical simulations have been carried out in a challenging scenario, and the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed architectures are discussed.	algorithm;cognitive radio;computer simulation;cyclostationary process;detection theory;feature detection (web development);frequency band;ieee 754-1985;mimo;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;overhead (computing);performance;signal processing;support vector machine	Luca Bixio;Marina Ottonello;Mirco Raffetto;Carlo S.

Firstly, a new parameterized form of Neighbor-dmin precoder is presented, where all angles containing the phase are assumed to be zero to reduce the number of difference vectors providing dmin. The optimization problem is, therefore, less complex and the new precoder has less distinct expressions. When a rectangular QAM modulation is used at the transmitter, the general Neighbor-dmin precoder for three independent data-streams is proposed. This precoder has only three expressions, which allocate power on one, two, and three virtual subchannels, respectively. Simulation results over Rayleigh fading channels confirm a significant bit-error-rate improvement of the new precoder in comparison with other traditional precoding strategies.	bit error rate;euclidean distance;mimo;mathematical optimization;modulation;most significant bit;optimization problem;rayleigh fading;simulation;transmitter	Quoc-Tuong Ngo;Olivier Berder;Pascal Scalart	2011	2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference			Robotics	39.83684767357701	83.96291296698001	72764

We propose an effective pilot contamination elimination scheme for multi-cell time division duplexing based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems, by carefully designing a sophisticated amalgam of downlink (DL) training and `scheduled' uplink (UL) training. During the DL training stage, each base station (BS) transmits the DL pilot symbols (PSs) to its mobile stations (MSs) for them to estimate their frequency-domain channel transfer functions (FDCHTFs), which are then embedded in the UL PSs by `predistorting' the PSs with the estimated FDCHTFs. During the scheduled UL training, each BS's UL receiver in turn extracts the FDCHTFs of its MSs from their received PSs by eliminating the pilot contamination imposed by the simultaneously transmitted UL PSs of all other cells. Our simulation results demonstrate that the pilot contamination is completely eliminated by the proposed scheme, even for the network consisting of a large number of unity frequency reuse cells. Most significantly, unlike many existing pilot contamination reduction schemes, our scheme does not rely on the assumption that each BS knows the second-order statistics of all the interfering UL channels.	division by zero;duplex (telecommunications);embedded system;frequency divider;multiplexing;pilot ace;simulation;telecommunications link	Jiankang Zhang;Bo Zhang;Sheng Chen;Xiaomin Mu;Mohammed El-Hajjar;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2014	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing	10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2309936	telecommunications	Mobile	40.84031035588233	85.27975549904862	73035

Especially, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) already standardized evolutions of the 2G and 4G networks to include IoT features. These new standards share the common trait of using blind repetitions to improve the legacy coverage of the system, renewing interest for diversity combining. The present paper focuses on the IQ combiner approach which works on complex baseband samples without any previous phase synchronization. Our study evaluates the impact of the frequency offset, resulting of an imperfect frequency synchronization, on the average Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of IQ-combined frames. We derive new closed-forms: a first one for the statistical distribution of the residual phase angle between two consecutive symbols after imperfect frequency demodulation, a second one for the average SNR of the combined frame. These derivations allow us to highlight and quantify the negative impact of an inaccurate frequency synchronization in the context of IQ combining strategies.	baseband;diplexer;frequency offset;internet of things;profiling (computer programming);signal-to-noise ratio;sybase iq	Louis-Adrien Dufrene;Matthieu Crussière;Jean-François Hélard;Jean Schwoerer	2017	2017 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2017.8108162	real-time computing;time diversity;computer science;synchronization;frequency offset;phase synchronization;frequency modulation;baseband;signal-to-noise ratio;diversity combining	Arch	44.23906489886585	82.86098336807373	73041

Building upon our earlier work, we propose a novel minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based receiver design tailored to broadband cooperative networks. We show that, by incorporating linear processing techniques, our MMSE-based receiver is able to collect full antenna and multipath diversity gains, while maintaining low complexity implementation. Specifically, under the assumption of perfect power control and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the underlying links and assuming either of source-to-relay (S → R) or relay-to-destination (R → D) links to be frequency selective Rician fading, our performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed receiver is able to achieve a maximum diversity order of min (LSR,LRD) + LSD + 2, where LSR, LRD, and LSD are the channel memory lengths for S → R, R → D, and source-to-destination (S → D) links, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed receiver outperforms the conventional cooperative MMSE-SC-FDE receiver by performing close to the matched filter bound (MFB).	adobe framemaker;carrier frequency;channel memory;computational complexity theory;equalization (communications);matched filter;maxima and minima;mean squared error;multipath propagation;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Homa Eghbali;Sami Muhaidat;Naofal Al-Dhahir	2011	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2010.011111.100088	minimum mean square error;space–time block code;equalization;strontium;telecommunications;power control;computer science;wireless network;cooperative diversity;radio receiver;matched filter;computational complexity theory;signal-to-noise ratio;frequency domain;fading;computer network;broadband networks	Mobile	42.25402116114527	79.35161640005639	73045

We consider the coherent detection of digital signals received over correlated Nakagami fading channels, where the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratios (SNR’s) of the diversity branches are not necessarily independent or identically distributed. Specifically: 1) these SNR’s can be arbitrarily correlated; 2) the SNR distributions can be from different Nakagami families, i.e., fading parameters (m’s) are not necessarily equal; and 3) the average SNR’s (averaged over the fading) of the branches are not necessarily equal. We derive closed-form expressions for three performance measures of a MRC diversity system: 1) probability density function (p.d.f.) of the combiner output SNR; 2) symbol error probability (SEP) for coherent detection; and 3) outage probability. We obtain a caiionzcal stnictzlre for these performance measures as a weighted sum of the corresponding expressions for a non-diversity (single-branch) system with appropriately-defined parameters. This result is fundamental: the canonical structure depends only on the properties of the channel and diversity combiner, and not on the specific modulation technique. Calculations of SEP for specific modulation techniques are illustrated through examples.	carrier recovery;coherence (physics);diplexer;downtime;maximal set;modulation;multipath propagation;norm (social);power dividers and directional couplers;signal-to-noise ratio;sun outage;symantec endpoint protection;weight function	Moe Z.

This ability of CRs makes them a feasible choice to achieve green radio networks. CRs perform spectrum sensing, wherein presence and/or absence of licensed users' signals is detected in the wideband input frequency range in order to allow opportunistic access of the vacant frequency bands to unlicensed users. Variable digital filters (VDFs) which can provide frequency responses with variable cutoff frequencies are widely used for spectrum sensing in CRs. In this paper, we propose an energy detector based spectrum sensing scheme which employs such VDFs based on first order all pass transformation and the modified coefficient decimation method. With the help of design example of an air-ground communication scenario, we show that VDFs employed in the proposed scheme are low complexity alternatives to the other relevant VDFs in literature. The proposed spectrum sensing scheme can be useful not only for solving the anticipated spectrum scarcity caused by the existing static spectrum allocation scheme in current air-ground communication systems, but also in achieving energy efficient green communications.	coefficient;cognitive radio;decimation (signal processing);digital filter;frequency allocation;frequency band;frequency response;radio frequency;spectral density;transceiver	Abhishek Ambede;Kavallur Gopi Smitha;A.

The method is that the mobile station observes and estimates the channel characteristic from the received signal, and pre-compensates the transmitted signal adapting to the fading channel to improve the performance. Although preamble signals are necessary in the conventional method to observe and estimate the channel characteristic, the proposed method needs not the preamble signals, which decrease the information rate. Computer simulations show better BER performance than the differential detection that is usually used in Rayleigh fading channel.	acm-mm;carrier recovery;coherent;computer simulation;duplex (telecommunications);rayleigh fading;test-driven development;transmitter;x.690	Young An Kim;Choong Seon Hong	2007	2007 International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering (MUE'07)	10.1109/MUE.2007.104	computer simulation;telecommunications;computer science;base station;fading;computer network	Mobile	43.76151080183228	80.32052460631571	73207

VPFDM allows each user to utilize multi-carrier frequency slots of the Vertical and Horizontal polarizations simultaneously. Since the VPFDM demodulator cancels cross-polarization interference by using signal processing, the user station can use a simple antenna that does not track polarization. In this paper, we introduce a new VPFDM demodulator with adaptive multi-carrier modulation (AMCM); it can vary the modulation level carrier by carrier to enhance frequency and power efficiency. We then propose a noise and frequency offset tolerant AFC that is the key to the success of AMCM. Finally, simulation results show its excellent performance.

As conventional PTS technique requires an exhaustive searching over all the combinations of the given phase factors, which results in the computational complexity increases exponentially with the number of the sub-blocks. In this paper, we aim to obtain the desirable PAPR reduction with the low computational complexity. Since the process of searching the optimal phase factors can be categorized as combinatorial optimization with some variables and constraints, we propose a novel scheme, which is based on a nonlinear optimization approach named as simulated annealing (SA), to search the optimal combination of phase factors with low complexity. To validate the analytical results, extensive simulations have been conducted, showing that the proposed schemes can achieve significant reduction in computational complexity while keeping good PAPR reduction.	brute-force search;categorization;combinatorial optimization;computation;computational complexity theory;data rate units;effective method;frequency divider;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;pts-dos;power architecture platform reference;reduction (complexity);simulated annealing;simulation;subcarrier	Tao Jiang;Weidong Xiang;Paul C.

Theoretical expressions are derived for the performance degradation caused by the timing jitter, in the presence of a multipath channel. Assuming an additive white Gaussian noise channel, perfect power control, and full load, it is shown that the performance degradation for the downlink transmission is independent of the number of subcarriers, of the spreading factor, and of the spectral contents of the jitter at the receiving mobile station, but only depends on the jitter variance. Under the same assumptions, we point out that, if the jitter spectra of all transmitting mobile stations are the same, the degradation on the uplink is the same as the degradation on the downlink.	additive white gaussian noise;elegant degradation;multipath propagation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Heidi Steendam;Marc Moeneclaey	2004	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2004.823632	additive white gaussian noise;code division multiple access;electronic engineering;jitter;index term;telecommunications;power control;computer science;engineering;mobile station;spread spectrum;computer network	Mobile	41.256761153328256	78.07674093881354	73689

A novel design method of transmit weights is proposed to successively eliminate the interference among DU's, each of which is equipped with multiple receive antennas. We firstly study the transmit weights design for the conventional Amplify-and-Forward (AF) relay system where the Relay Station (RS) just retransmits the received signals, then we extend it to the joint design of transmit weights both at the Base Station (BS) and the RS. In the joint design, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used for the first channel link (link between BS and RS), then a user selection algorithm is adopted at the RS to generate the transmit weight of each DU. The channel matrix of system is transformed into a triangular matrix, where the Dirty Paper Coding (DPC) technique is employed to remove the interference among DU's and maintain the achievable rate of system.

In the uplink of DS-CDMA systems, however, the base station receiver typically knows the spreading waveforms of the users within its cell but does not know those of the users in other cells. In this paper, we propose a partial zero-forcing adaptive minimum mean squared error (MMSE) receiver for the DS-CDMA uplink utilizing the spreading waveforms known at the base station as well as training data. The proposed receiver first removes the intracell interference using a linear filter based on the knowledge of the spreading waveforms of the interfering users within the cell. Then the intercell interference remaining in the output of the linear filter is mitigated by adaptive MMSE detection. To speed up the convergence of the adaptive filter weights without loss of the steady-state performance, we develop a modified least mean square (LMS) algorithm based on the canonical representation of the filter weights. It is shown through analysis and simulation results that the proposed receiver improves the convergence speed and the steady-state performance.	adaptive filter;algorithm;electronic filter;interference (communication);least mean squares filter;mean squared error;multi-user;simulation;steady state;telecommunications link;zero suppression;zero-forcing precoding	Ju Ho Lee;Hyung-Myung Kim	2002	IEEE Trans.

However, lower SNR ranges appear in many practical scenarios. Thus, further improvements of the Cadambe-Jafar scheme are demanded to enable interference alignment in more realistic settings. In this work, we propose a new precoding vector optimization that improves bit error rates (BER) using zero-forcing at the receivers. Furthermore, we compare and combine our approach with existing performance enhancement techniques for interference alignment such as orthonormalizing the precoding matrices or using lattice decoding instead of zero-forcing at the receiver. Finally, we implement interference alignment with symbol extension in the frequency domain along with the presented BER enhancement techniques on a software defined radio platform to validate our approaches. Both simulation results and testbed measurements show significant BER improvements for different M-QAM schemes compared to the original interference alignment mechanism. Moreover, our precoding optimization scheme based on zero-forcing outperforms lattice decoding in practical systems due to its lower sensitivity to real-world effects.	bit error rate;etsi satellite digital radio;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;testbed;vector optimization;x.690;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Alexander Kühne;Adrian Loch;Thomas Nitsche;Joerg Widmer;Matthias Hollick;Anja Klein	2014	2014 11th International Symposium on Wireless Communications Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2014.6933317	bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;lattice;zero-forcing precoding;mathematics;interference;signal-to-noise ratio	Arch	45.16318263656452	79.06987152446538	73971

We first describe an implementation of ML detection separating Inand Quadrature-phase components and using wellknown linear filters. In the proposed algorithm, we produce hypothesis symbol vectors in a tree structure by partly changing the sub-optimum hard decisions based on the linear filter output. At each stage, we adopt the best M likely paths with respect to the true log likelihood or distance function as survivors. We determine the symbol vector which minimizes the distance function at the final stage. Although the complexity of ML detector is exponentially increasing as a function of the number of users, the proposed scheme requires by far less complexity. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves equivalent Bit Error Rate (BER) performance with lower complexity in comparison with ML detector by computer simulations. Moreover we compare the proposed detection scheme with QRD-M algorithm which is based on QR decomposition combined with M algorithm. key words: MC-CDMA, maximum likelihood detector, tree structure, M algorithm, LLR, QRD-M algorithm	algorithm;bit error rate;computer simulation;in-phase and quadrature components;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;multi-user;qr decomposition;telecommunications link;tree structure;x.690	Yoshihito Morishige;Masahiro Fujii;Makoto Itami;Kohji Itoh	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e89-a.10.2622	mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;tree structure	Vision	47.40384138116701	76.85827904305741	74064

To mitigate the resulting time- and frequency-selective (or doubly-selective) channels, an optimal training strategy is designed in this paper for block transmissions over doubly-selective channels, relying on a basis expansion channel model. The optimality in designing our PSAM parameters consists of maximizing a tight lower bound on the average channel capacity, that is also shown to be equivalent to the minimization of the minimum mean-square channel estimation error. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical designs.	carrier frequency;channel (communications);channel capacity;channel state information;doppler effect;selectivity (electronic);software propagation	Xiaoli Ma;Georgios B.

Based on its trellis structure, a low-complexity suboptimal differential decoder using the per-survival processing technique (PSP) is developed. In slow fading channels, it can approach the performance of SOSTTC with coherent decoding. Furthermore, an adaptive receiver is presented for time-varying channels, in which no training data is needed. Simulation results show that our scheme can achieve a good performance in both slow fading and time-varying fading channels with a reasonable complexity.	algorithm;carrier recovery;coding gain;coherence (physics);convolutional code;recursive least squares filter;simulation;trellis quantization;viterbi decoder	Xiang-Gen Xia	2005	Proceedings.

This paper addresses the problem of channel estimation in an underlay interference-prone cognitive radio setup. We consider a primary and a secondary base station, both with multiple antenna capability and serving multiple users. Although previous studies propose the use of beamforming to handle secondary-caused interference, this cannot be done in practice unless channels are correctly estimated in the first place. However channel estimation itself is plagued by interference (pilot contamination effects). Therefore we propose a method to address channel estimation at the primary system while removing contamination caused by the secondary transmitter. The approach is twofold: (i) We develop a robust channel estimator which makes use of covariance information. We show analytically that the performance of this estimator is identical to the interference free scenario under certain when the number of antennas becomes large under a condition on the distribution of the multipath model. (ii) We build a pilot assignment algorithm which seeks to fulfill this condition. Significant gains are reported.	algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;cognitive radio;interference (communication);list of code lyoko episodes;mimo;multi-user;multipath propagation;pilot ace;transmitter	Miltiades Filippou;David Gesbert;Haifan Yin	2012	2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328481	control channel;transmitter;3g mimo;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;operating system;co-channel interference;scheduling;computer network;mimo	Arch	41.47321635944187	84.63420979864148	74226

However, since the number of pilot symbol is proportionally depending on the number of transmit antenna, the total transmission rate of massive MIMO would be degraded. To solve this problem, channel estimation by virtual pilot signal (VPS) with a few pilot signals has been proposed. However, since the conventional method iteratively identifies the channel state information (CSI), the complexity is considerable work. Then again, time-frequency interferometry (TFI)-OFDM has been proposed. This method can achieve a good BER performance with a few pilot symbols. In this paper, we propose a novel channel compensation based on VPS and TFI for massive MIMO without increasing the system complexity. The proposed scheme has a low complexity, with improving BER performance to compared with the conventional method using linear interpolation and FFT/IFFT after specific operations. From the simulation results, the proposed scheme can improve BER performance to compared with the conventional method in 4 × 4 and 8 × 8MIMO systems.	channel state information;fast fourier transform;linear interpolation;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multipath propagation;simulation;tfi-5;virtual private server;x.690	Masaya Okamura;Chang-Jun Ahn;Tatsuya Omori;Ken-ya Hashimoto	2015	2015 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)	10.1109/ISPACS.2015.7432829	3g mimo;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;precoding;mimo	Mobile	47.8752265865222	79.85580551443489	74304

In our previous work we have developed DualCUSUM, a distributed algorithm for change detection and used it for cooperative spectrum sensing. The algorithm is based on sequential change detection techniques which optimally use the past observations. But DualCUSUM requires the knowledge of the channel gains for each of the secondary users. In this work we modify DualCUSUM to develop GLR-CUSUM which can work with imprecise estimates of the channel gains. Next we extend the algorithm to the case where the receiver noise power is also not known exactly. We show that the SNR wall problem encountered in this scenario is not experienced by our algorithm.

9d2f6227d50cd60d6b7edc77f8e3c93a0ca502b7	a pca-based modeling method for wireless mimo channel		Geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel describes the channel impulse response (CIR) in the sense of rays and clusters, which obey the empirical distributions. Thus, the correlation between MIMO sub-channels is not explicitly defined, which makes it difficult for GBSM to predict channel capacity accurately. Facing the increased antenna number of massive MIMO for fifth generation (5G) communication, we propose a channel modeling method using principal component analysis (PCA). This method takes advantage of the hidden features and structures extracted from the measured channel data, combining the information of the scenario and antenna configurations, to reconstruct the amplitude and phase of the CIR respectively. The sparse features and structures can efficiently support the high antenna number of massive MIMO. By the proposed scheme, the accuracy of 56 × 32 MIMO capacity improves 12.8% compared with the GBSM model.	channel capacity;committed information rate;fifth generation computer;mimo;principal component analysis;simulation;sparse matrix	Xiaochuan Ma;Jianhua Zhang;Yuxiang Zhang;Zhanyu Ma;Yu Zhang	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2017.8116491	3g mimo;topology;mimo;spatial multiplexing;wireless;multi-user mimo;impulse response;communication channel;channel capacity;computer science	Vision	43.565897095661946	84.86231142655414	74631

Processing of data from a large number of receive array elements involves a large number of receivers, resulting in high cost and complex implementations. In many practical applications, a large number of receiving antenna elements is available, however, the number of receivers is limited due to their high cost. In this work, we address the problem of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation with a large number of antenna array elements and a small number of receivers, where the receivers are connected to the array elements via a reconfigurable switching matrix. A cognitive approach, named cognitive antenna selection (CASE), for sequentially switching the elements of the array based on previous observations is proposed. The criterion for antenna selection is based on minimization of the conditional Bobrovski-Zakai bound (BZB) given history observations on the mean-squared-error (MSE) of the DOA estimate. The performance of the CASE algorithm is evaluated via simulations and compared to two other non-adaptive approaches. It is shown that the CASE algorithm outperforms the other compared algorithms in terms of MSE both asymptotically and in the threshold region.	algorithm;array processing;cognition;dvd region code;direction of arrival;mean squared error;sampling (signal processing);simulation	Omri Isaacs;Joseph Tabrikian;Igal Bilik	2015	2015 IEEE 6th International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)	10.1109/CAMSAP.2015.7383806	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;smart antenna;sensor array;sparse array	Visualization	45.368846249304795	74.90126651952878	74670

For a temporally correlated fading process with band-limited Doppler spectrum in [-F, F], with 0 ≤ F <; 1/2, it has been shown that ZF achieves a fraction 1-2F of the optimal degrees of freedom (DoF). On the other hand, MAT exploits delayed channel state information at transmitter (CSIT) and guarantees a constant DoF irrespectively of the fading Doppler bandwidth. In this work, we compare the net DoFs of both schemes by accounting for the correlation between fading blocks and for the resource required for downlink channel estimation. It is found that the downlink training for each receiver to learn the CSI of the others might be detrimental for the performance of MAT especially when the system size (number of users and transmit antennas) is not much smaller than the channel block length.	bandlimiting;beamforming;block code;broadcast domain;channel state information;system analysis;telecommunications link;transmitter;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Mari Kobayashi;Giuseppe Caire	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283919	spatial correlation;channel code;telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;channel state information;precoding;statistics	Mobile	39.717538277415336	80.99080222135859	75138

Despite promising a better result, CS based channel estimation still suffers from high complexity computations due to huge matrix multiplication and matrix inversion operations. This paper will propose an effective CS based channel estimation VLSI architecture for ISDB-T system. Since ISDB-T system is using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique for its transmission, its CS channel estimation will utilize a measurement matrix which is formed by parts of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrix. By exploiting the fact that the measurement matrix will inherit some symmetrical properties from DFT matrix, we can achieve a low complexity CS based channel estimation for practical implementation.	approximation;channel state information;compressed sensing;computation;dft matrix;discrete fourier transform;elegant degradation;frequency divider;isdb;matrix multiplication;multiplexing;reduction (complexity);strength reduction;very-large-scale integration;x.690	Rian Ferdian;Yafei Hou;Minoru Okada	2015	2015 15th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2015.7458360	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;theoretical computer science	EDA	48.316608528203645	80.22767148041935	75536
54b5facd96bd51e22c64fd1ba905fef6df8b0c76	asep of mimo system with mmse-osic detection over weibull-gamma fading channel subject to awggn		Ordered successive interference cancellation (OSIC) is adopted with minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection to enhance the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system performance. The optimum detection technique improves the error rate performance but increases system complexity. Therefore, MMSE-OSIC detection is used which reduces error rate compared to traditional MMSE with low complexity. The system performance is analyzed in composite fading environment that includes multipath and shadowing effects known as Weibull-Gamma (WG) fading. Along with the composite fading, a generalized noise that is additive white generalized Gaussian noise (AWGGN) is considered to show the impact of wireless scenario. This noise model includes various forms of noise as special cases such as impulsive, Gamma, Laplacian, Gaussian, and uniform. Consequently, generalized Q-function is used to model noise. The average symbol error probability (ASEP) of MIMO system is computed for 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) using MMSE-OSIC detection in WG fading perturbed by AWGGN. Analytical expressions are given in terms of Fox-H function (FHF). These expressions demonstrate the best fit to simulation results.	additive white gaussian noise;curve fitting;gamma correction;interference (communication);mimo;mast radiator;mean squared error;multipath propagation;noise shaping;pulse-width modulation;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Keerti Tiwari;Davinder S.

In GPSM only a part of the receive antennas is activated with the aid of pre- coding at the transmitter. Hence, information bits are mapped to a spatial symbol, corresponding to a particular activation pattern, and to modulation symbols. Optimal performance is achieved with a Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector, but its exhaustive search leads to an intractable complexity. In this paper we present a novel detector, referred to as Soft MMSE with Exhaustive Search (SOMES) detector, that computes soft information for each symbol by employing a soft- output Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) detector.

A modification of the traditional subspace methods is derived to suit the non-contiguous nature of training data in mobile communication systems. To track the time variation of the channel, a new recursive subspace-based channel estimation is proposed and demonstrated in simulation with practical MIMO channel models. The comparison between the state-space-based channel estimation algorithm and the FIR-based Recursive Least Squares algorithm shows the former is a more robust modeling approach than the latter. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We show how, in an LTE-Advanced system, CSI harvesting mechanism followed by the conventional Zero-Forcing Beam-Forming (ZFBF) results in improved MU-MIMO performance, relative to the current method for acquiring CSI at the transmitter. The proposed progressive CSI harvesting scheme is also shown to yield significant saving in terms of feedback overhead.

Traditional static threshold-based decision strategy in the fusion center (FC) can be effective to defend against the deterministic SSDF attacks, but useless for the probability SSDF attacks. In this paper, based on the analysis of relationships between the threshold and the fusion value in the FC, a dynamic threshold-based strategy is proposed to defend against the probability SSDF attacks. In this method, the dynamic threshold is updated according to the fusion value's upper and lower bounds, which are achieved by past observations of the fusion value. By this method, both the false alarm and the missed detection probabilities can be theoretically decreased. Simulation results show that our proposal outperforms the static threshold-based strategy in defending against all kind of SSDF attacks in CRNs.	cognitive radio;decision theory;malware;simulation	Liangliang Wang;Lin Zhang;Xiang Chen	2015	2015 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2015.7341094	telecommunications;computer science;communication;computer security	Mobile	47.79622353912509	87.68220696993147	76270

In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a widely linear (WL) cooperative strategy at a fusion center side where the CR user statistics have been received by means of multipath fading channels. The proposed strategy jointly elaborates the received signal and its conjugate version to take advantage by the information contained in the statistical pseudo-covariance function of the received signal. We design the WL strategy to maximize a modified deflection coefficient and we compare it with a strictly linear (SL) cooperative strategy. Results of numerical simulations show that the WL fusion-rule outperforms the SL one in operative conditions of practical interest.	coefficient;cognitive radio;interference (communication);multipath propagation;numerical analysis;programming paradigm;sl (complexity);sl-1;simpson's rule;simulation	Angela Sara Cacciapuoti;Marcello Caleffi;Luigi Paura	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683198	computer simulation;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network	Mobile	48.24571492784716	86.78593521994114	76723

In this paper, we propose a family of distributed space-frequency codes (SFCs) for cooperative transmissions with multiple CFOs and flat fading channels. These codes can achieve full cooperative (spatial) diversity with only linear receivers, such as zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers, instead of the computationally exhausted maximum likelihood (ML) detector. The codes in this family have different symbol rates, orthogonality and performances for different number of relay nodes, which can be adjusted by choosing different design parameters. Actually, frequency-reversal SFC (FR-SFC), and frequency-shift SFC (FS-SFC) proposed in our previous paper are special cases of the new codes. Furthermore, new SFCs outperform both FD-SFC and FS-SFC can be obtained, from the systematic design.	carrier frequency;code;internet relay chat;mimo;mean squared error;performance;space-filling curve;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Huiming Wang;Qinye Yin	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5501923	telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Robotics	43.52126574940918	76.91744569100923	76959

We propose a framework based on canonical multipath-Doppler coordinates for addressing these issues in an integrated fashion. The canonical coordinates are derived from a fundamental characterization of channel propagation dynamics in terms of discrete multipath-delayed and Doppler-shifted copies of the transmitted waveform. These delayed and Doppler-shifted spreading waveforms constitute a natural fixed basis and dictate a canonical low-dimensional processing. In addition to providing a robust vehicle for channel modeling and estimation the framework facilitates exploitation of dispersion effects for MAI suppression via subspace-based processing in the canonical coordinates. Finally, the low-dimensional subspace formulation affords a direct handle on the complexity of the DSP algorithms.		Akbar M.

A block-spreading code-division multiple-access (BS-CDMA) system with zero correlation window (ZCW) is designed and applied in UWB systems. It is shown that multiple access interference is completely removed by maintaining code orthogonality, even with asynchronous reception. Furthermore, the UWB channel can be modelled as a block circulant matrix by re-ordering the received sequence. With the advantage of the circulant matrix, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) based minimum mean square error equalization scheme is applied to eliminate the ISI to such an extent that the system performance approaches the AWGN channel. As the large number order of the UWB channel, the FFT based equalization scheme also dramatically decreases the computational complexity.	additive white gaussian noise;circulant matrix;code;computation;computational complexity theory;fast fourier transform;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);mean squared error;multi-user;signal-to-noise ratio;ultra-wideband;x.690	Yang Tang;Branka Vucetic;Yonghui Li	2005	IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2005.

Uniform planar array (UPA) antenna structures are a focus of much commercial discussion because of their ability to enable a large number of antennas in a relatively small area. With UPA antenna structures, the base station can control the beam direction in both the horizontal and vertical domains simultaneously. However, channel conditions may dictate that one dimension requires higher channel state information (CSI) accuracy than the other. We propose the use of an additional one bit of feedback information sent from the user to the base station to indicate the preferred domain on top of the feedback overhead of CSI quantization in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems. Combined with variable-rate CSI quantization schemes, the numerical studies show that the additional one bit of feedback can increase the quality of CSI significantly for UPA antenna structures.	channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);frequency divider;mimo;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);quantization (image processing);quantization (signal processing);simulation	Junil Choi;Taeyoung Kim;David James Love;Ji-Yun Seol	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248530	3g mimo;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;control theory	Mobile	40.751810892500316	85.72602960516483	77369

The proposed switching efficient scheme (SES) uses the scan and wait (SWC) combining technique where a transmission occurs only when a branch with an acceptable performance is found, otherwise data is buffered. In our scheme, the modulation constellation size and the used transmit branch are determined to achieve the highest spectral efficiency with a minimum processing power, given the fading channel conditions, the required error rate performance, and a peak interference constraint to the primary receiver. Selected numerical examples show that the SES scheme minimizes the average number of switched branches for the average and the high secondary signal-to-noise ratio range. This improvement comes at the expense of a small delay introduced by the SWC technique. For reference, we also compare the performance of the SES scheme to the selection diversity scheme (SDS) where the best branch verifying the modulation mode and the interference constraint is always selected.	accessible surface area;adaptive filter;adobe swc file;cognitive radio;interference (communication);modulation;multi-user;numerical analysis;scsi enclosure services;scheme;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;transmitter;verification and validation	Khalid A.

In MIMO systems, eigen-beam space division multiplexing (E-SDM) that achieves good performance by weighting at the transmitter using channel state information (CSI) has been studied. Early studies for E-SDM have assumed perfect CSI at the transmitter. However, in practice, CSI fed back to the transmitter is not identical to that when the signals are transmitted owing to the time-varying nature of channels and feedback delay. As a result, the performance of E-SDM is degraded. In this paper, as methods that reduce the performance degradation of E-SDM in the presence of feedback delay, we evaluate the performance of a method that predicts CSI when the signals are transmitted at the receiver and feeds the predicted CSI back to the transmitter (denoted by channel prediction method). We also evaluate the performance of a method that uses the receive weight based on zero-forcing (ZF) or minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion instead of those based on singular value decomposition (SVD) criterion (denoted by ZF or MMSE receive weight method). Simulation results show that bit error rate (BER) degradation of E-SDM in the presence of feedback delay is reduced by three methods. We also show that the ZF and MMSE receive weight methods achieve the identical BER with smaller amount of calculation than the channel prediction method.	bit error rate;cap gemini sdm;channel state information;eigen (c++ library);eisenstein's criterion;elegant degradation;feedback;mimo;mean squared error;multiplexing;simulation;singular value decomposition;software development process;spectral efficiency;transmitter;x.690;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Kazuyuki Kobayashi;Tomoaki Ohtsuki;Toshinobu Kaneko	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.255723	zero forcing equalizer;minimum mean square error;transmitter;degradation;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;feedback;mathematics;channel state information;singular value decomposition;statistics;spectral efficiency;data transmission;mimo	Mobile	43.8822232305243	80.34204167526096	77579

The ultimate goal of the PCP-OFDM system is to achieve concurrent transmission of CR control signaling parameters with data information. Therefore, hardware and computational efficient demodulation of PCP is of huge importance to recover the signaling parameters and for the design of fair spectrum sharing mechanism in cognitive radio scenario. But due to the hardware and computational complexity of the conventional optimal matched filter [2], recently a demodulator was proposed in paper [3] which has reduced complexity than the conventional approach. However, the complexity is still high which is often very difficult to implement and also not cost-effective. In this paper, we propose a low complexity demodulator for the efficient demodulation of the signaling information carried by the PCPs. Design of this demodulator is presented and performance is evaluated through the simulations in different channel scenarios. Along with a peak combining technique, impact of the multipath impairment can be mitigated to a reasonable extent. More importantly, the hardware and computational complexity is reduced substantially compared with the other techniques proposed earlier. It is also found from the numerical simulation results that this demodulation scheme provides the same performance as the conventional optimal matched filter, with significantly reduced hardware and computational complexity, therefore reducing the overall complexity and cost of the PCP-OFDM receiver.	bit error rate;cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;matched filter;multipath propagation;multiplexing;pcp theorem;selection algorithm	Md.

To further improve the performance of blind equalizers, we propose a channel shortening method that attempts to maximize the minimum FFT output power over data subcarriers. Simulation results indicate that the max-min strategy has performance improvement over a conventional channel shortening method. key words: inter-block interference, carrier nulling algorithm, blind equalization, semi-definite relaxation	algorithm;blind equalization;equalization (communications);fast fourier transform;interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;maxima and minima;semiconductor industry;simulation;subcarrier	Tsukasa Takahashi;Teruyuki Miyajima	2013	IEICE Transactions		telecommunications;electrical engineering;blind equalization;control theory	EDA	49.087556348740414	81.55952872457961	77726

Here, the authors address the noise variance estimation problem for signal-to-noise ratio estimation in such systems. Our investigations focus on the estimation schemes both robust to the pilot sequence and the channel type. First, the authors, respectively, define the correlated noise samples and the uncorrelated ones, where the difference signals or the sum signals of two adjacent received pilot signals are included. Then, with the help of the Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB) theorem, the authors either use the correlated or the uncorrelated samples to estimate the noise variance based on the difference signals and the sum signals, respectively, regardless of the pilot sequences. The corresponding CRLBs are also given and analysed. Finally, under either the correlated or the uncorrelated noise samples, the authors propose to linearly combine the estimator of the difference signals with that of the sum signals where the weight coefficients are optimised. Since the proposed two combined estimators are not only robust to the pilot sequence but also automatically adapt the weights to the channel condition, they can significantly outperform the existing estimators.	carrier frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;ultra-wideband	Dan Wang;Qing Zhao;Lei Yang	2015	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2014.1000	telecommunications;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	51.55287085164234	78.54740269264447	77903

The results show that comparing with the case where the training data utilizes the homogeneous secondary samples (which are independent and identically distributed (IID) to the snapshot in the cell under test (CUT)), formulating the adaptive weight with the secondary samples which have stronger clutter power than that in CUT will increase the output SINR. Nevertheless, the achievable performance improvement might be quite limited. Conversely, selecting the secondary samples with weaker clutter power will degrade the performance.	algorithm;clutter;interference (communication);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;snapshot (computer storage)	Bo Tang;Jun Tang;Yingning Peng	2013	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2013.6494421	electronic engineering;speech recognition;computer science;constant false alarm rate;mathematics;clutter	HPC	50.768100216648385	88.17583486692484	77965
9dce542deccdda58db2a9e20df9e16255f727adf	single carrier waveform solution for millimeter wave air interface		Ultra broadband mobile communication is a key requirement of fifth generation (5G) wireless cellular networks. To fulfill this requirement much larger bandwidth is needed which can be delivered in millimeter band from 30 to 300 GHz. Beam formed transmission over a massive MIMO (m-MIMO) structure is an essential element of a millimeter wave (mmwave) system to compensate the large air propagation loss. This however requires new air interface design to overcome hardware limitations tied to m-MIMO and mmwave, particularly for higher frequencies above 40 GHz. In this paper a block-wise single carrier (BWSC) waveform with low peak-to-average ratio (PAPR) is proposed to lower the cost of massive number of RF components needed to realize an m-MIMO structure for mmwave. Same as OFDM, data-based cyclic prefix (CP) is attached to every BWSC block to enable frequency domain equalization (FDE). Evaluations have been conducted to demonstrate the advantage of data-CP BWSC over orthogonal division multiplexing (OFDM) and null-CP single carrier waveform in terms of some key performance measures such as system efficiency, adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR), inter-symbol inference (ISI) and PAPR.	adobe framemaker;circular convolution;fifth generation computer;mimo;multiplexing;noise shaping;nonlinear system;overhead (computing);phase noise;power architecture platform reference;radio frequency;software propagation;spectral leakage;waveform	Hosein Nikopour;Wookbong Lee;Roya Doostnejad;Eren Sasoglu;Claudio R.

In particular, this paper considers the use of orthogonal polyphase (OPP) sequences on the synchronous and asynchronous uplink to benefit from the codes’ good cross-correlation properties. A code allocation algorithm is also presented in this paper that aims to exploit the cross-correlation properties to achieve the best possible system performance. For the sake of comprehensiveness, the paper compares the performance of this new diversity technique with a conventional pairing diversity technique and with the well known maximum gain combined (MGC) time diversity. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional pairing technique, in terms of BER, and with proper code allocation, is also able to outperform time diversity systems. The new algorithm is able to accommodate up to 200% system loading even under severe asynchronous and multipath conditions.	algorithm;asynchronous i/o;cross-correlation;multipath propagation;open prosthetics project;polyphase matrix;polyphase quadrature filter;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;whole earth 'lectronic link;x.690	A.

A second, auxiliary antenna and channel are employed by an SLB system to produce a second output. This latter output is compared to that of the primary antenna channel, and a decision is then made, based on the classic Maisel SLB architecture, as to whether to blank the primary channel output. This work extends previous performance results, with more realistic and versatile expanded models for targets and interference. The determination of SLB performance involves the evaluation of several probability functions. The derived probability expressions allow for an arbitrary number of integrated pulses. The SLB design and performance results can be determined with these probability functions. In this paper, examples are presented and discussed, and design results for typical SLB systems are obtained.	interference (communication);primary channel;radar;vertical blanking interval	David A.

This can be overcome by sending a (know) training sequence and identifying the channel (active identification). However, in a nonstationary context, the channel model has to be updated by periodically sending the training sequence, thus reducing the transmission rate. We address herein the problem of blind identification, which does not require such a sequence and allows a higher transmission rate. In order to track nonstationary channels, we have derived an adaiptive (Kalman) algorithm which directly estimates the entire set of characteristic parameters. An original adaptive estimation of the noise model has been proposed for this investigation. Monte-Carlo simulations confm the expected results and demonstrate the performance.	algorithm;channel (communications);interference (communication);monte carlo method;multipath propagation;rayleigh fading;simulation	Joel Grouffaud;Pascal Larzabal;Henri Clergeot	1997		10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604641	telecommunications;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics;monte carlo method	ML	48.925715559814314	75.07219407550882	78329
9e4c4e9ad2d6d344e629e2b99b52483e8a4083a4	an efficient cross-layer scheduling with partial channel state information		The proposed Cross-Layer scheduling can boost the spectral efficiency of multi-user OFDMA wireless systems with heterogeneous delay requirements. The existing designs usually have two important assumptions that the users are delay insensitive and Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT) is perfect. In practice, users have heterogeneous delay requirements and CSIT usually becomes outdated in time varying channel, which in turn leads to systematic packet errors and hence results in significant degradation on the throughput. The Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) is a promising tool for increasing the spectral efficiency of time varying channel, while maintaining the target Bit Error Rate (BER) and the Packet Error Rate (PER). In this paper, a novel design problem is formulated which combines AMC and CSI at the physical layer and scheduling using queuing theory at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, in order to maximize the throughput and spectral efficiency under the heterogeneous delay constraints. For the above proposed work, transmissions on Rayleigh fading channel including Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) are employed. Simulation results show that the proposed scheduler provides robust system performance enhancement over conventional cross-layer scheduler with perfect CSIT.	access control;additive model;additive white gaussian noise;advanced mezzanine card;bit error rate;camera serial interface;channel state information;elegant degradation;modulation;multi-user;network packet;quality of service;queueing theory;rayleigh fading;requirement;retransmission (data networks);scheduling (computing);simulation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;throughput;transmitter;x.690	Indumathi Ganesan;Murugesan Karuppasamy	2011	Informatica (Slovenia)		real-time computing;telecommunications	Mobile	40.8407279794351	82.6015341193098	78339

We have developed a new formulation for a spatial-temporal decorrelating detector using the maximum-likelihood criteria. The detector is shown to be near–far resistant. We propose to implement the spatial-temporal decorrelating receiver iteratively by applying the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. Simulation results show that the SAGE-based decorrelating receiver significantly outperforms the conventional single-user receiver and with performance close to that of a spatial-temporal decorrelating receiver with known channel parameters. We have observed that adding base-station antennas can actually improve convergence of the proposed iterative receiver.	code;decorrelation;detection theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;iterative method;multi-user;rayleigh fading;simulation;telecommunications link	Ruifeng Wang;Steven D.

6b1b7bf1bc9fc733c4d828570cefb832e015351e	multidimensional constellations for uplink scma systems - a comparative study		Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a class of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) that is proposed to support uplink machine-type communication services. In an SCMA system, designing multidimensional constellation plays an important role in the performance of the system. Since the behavior of multidimensional constellations highly depends on the type of the channel, it is crucial to employ a constellation that is suitable for a certain application. In this paper, we first highlight and review the key performance indicators (KPIs) of multidimensional constellations that should be considered in their design process for various channel scenarios. We then provide a survey on the known multidimensional constellations in the context of SCMA systems with their design criteria. The performance of some of those constellations are evaluated for uncoded, high-rate, and low-rate LTE turbo-coded SCMA systems under different channel conditions through extensive simulations. All turbo-coded comparisons are performed for bit-interleaved coded modulation, with a concatenated detection and decoding scheme. Simulation results confirm that multidimensional constellations that satisfy KPIs of a certain channel scenario outperform others. Moreover, the bit error rate performance of uncoded systems, and the performance of the coded systems are coupled to their bit-labeling. The performance of the systems also remarkably depends on the behavior of the multi-user detector at different signal-to-noise ratio regions.	bit error rate;compaq lte;concatenation;modulation;multi-user;neural coding;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sparse;telecommunications link	Monirosharieh Vameghestahbanati;Ian D.

However, they are yet to be practical due to high scheduling overhead in mobile, radio-unfriendly, mining environments. A new decentralized relay-assisted multiuser MIMO approach is proposed, which cuts the overhead by 80% and enables relay-assisted multiuser MIMO to be implemented in practice. This approach is a new distributed participatory downlink transmission method, where both the relays and destinations participate in the scheduling decisions. A new recursive algorithm is also developed to optimally quantize the channel conditions of the vehicles, thereby minimizing the feedback requirement. Analytical results, confirmed by simulations, show that the proposed approach is able to achieve 97.6% of the sum-rate upper bound of the network, using only three bits to characterize the channel condition of each vehicle. In terms of throughput, the proposed decentralized scheme can perform 45.2% better than the existing centralized scheme. The proposed approach is compatible with industrial communication standards and can be implemented with commercial industrial communication systems.	aggregate data;algorithm;centralized computing;data rate units;mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;overhead (computing);recursion (computer science);relay;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;uncompressed video	Wei Ni;Iain B.

c5088339c3d0f0b43c0509cd28b884aef3ee7742	hybrid sub-nyquist spectrum sensing with geo-location database in m2m communications		To enable dynamic spectrum access of machine-to- machine (M2M) communications for internet of thigns (IoT) applications, incorporating real-time wideband spectrum sensing with geo- location database is a promising approach to reducing complexity and promoting low latency. However, high sampling rate and high speed signal processing of the wideband signal acquisition pose a major implementation challenge in compact M2M/IoT devices with limited power supply and low computation capabilities. In this paper, to reduce the required sampling rate without degrading the detection performance, a hybrid sub- Nyquist wideband spectrum sensing scheme with geo-location database is proposed. The iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm is modified to incorporate a priori information from geo-location database, therefore enabling local spectrum sensing to be performed only on a limited number of potentially vacant TV channels. Theoretical analyses and experimental results show that the proposed hybrid scheme improves detec- tion performance with reduced sub-Nyquist sampling ratio and demonstrates a better detection capability over lower signal-to- noise ratio (SNR) regions.	algorithm;computation;geolocation;iteratively reweighted least squares;machine to machine;nyquist rate;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;power supply;real-time clock;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio	Yue Gao;Xingjian Zhang;Yuan Ma	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8287975	electronic engineering;iteratively reweighted least squares;computer science;database;latency (engineering);nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;sampling (statistics);sampling (signal processing);signal processing;wideband;communication channel	Mobile	51.92406360267412	83.96739430429938	78726

We first consider a fixed data rate system and vary the number of transmit antennas and constellation such that the minimum margin in the signalto-noise ratio (SNR) is maximized for linear and Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST) receivers. We also derive transmit antenna and constellation selection criteria for a successive interference cancellation receiver (SCR) with a fixed detection order and a variable number of bits transmitted on each substream. Compared with a system using all available antennas, performance results show significant gains using a subset of transmit antennas, even for independent fading channels. Finally, we select a subset of transmit antennas to maximize data rate given a minimum SNR margin. A lower bound on the maximum outage data rate is derived. The maximum outage data rate of the SCR receiver is seen to be close to the outage channel capacity.	blast;bell laboratories layered space-time;channel capacity;data rate units;interference (communication);mimo;noise margin;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial multiplexing;sun outage;uncompressed video	Ravi Narasimhan	2003	IEEE Trans.

Simulation results demonstrate that the LCRs and AFDs of the correlation signals are larger than those of the uncorrelated signals at lower levels. Furthermore, the effects of fading severity of the channel and the number of diversity branches on the LCRs and AFDs are also studied.	maximal set;simulation	Dongdong Li;Vasant K.

This CDF and associated formulas are then used to find out the error probability of non-coherent M-ary frequency shift keying with multichannel reception. Simple finite-range integral expression for the symbol error probability (SEP) with selection diversity is found through CDF method. Next, closed-form expressions of moment generating functions (MGF) are presented for the switched diversity case and SEP values are calculated using the derived MGFs. Some other performance parameters like, outage probability and average SNR with switched diversity, are provided. In addition, analytic frameworks are presented for calculation of optimum switching thresholds that ensure minimum outage probability or minimum SEP.

In the TDD Low Chip Rate (LCR) UMTS system after the frequency scan procedure, which alms to find the carrier frequency, an error as great as 20 kHz is expected. The requested maximum frequency offset between the local oscillator and the Node B oscillator is 200 Hz (0.1 ppm.). The aim of this paper is to present a frequency recovery algorithm suited for the TDD/sub LCR/ system and to verify if the requested precision of 0.1 ppm is reachable with the proposed frame format. Many data aided frequency estimators have been proposed in the literature. In this paper the best suitable estimator for TDD/sub LCR/ (Luise et al.

The performance results show that a combination of an open loop estimation with a closed loop configuration, exploiting two different training sequences, ensure a final accuracy of 0.1 ppm, even in the worst environment conditions. The modified nonlinear recursive algorithm, introduced in the closed loop configuration, is a promising approach to increase accuracy and to reduce convergence time.	algorithm;nonlinear system;test-driven development	Caterina Cangemi;Alessandro Ventura	2002		10.1109/PIMRC.2002.1045442	chip;synchronization;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;frequency offset;control theory;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;oscillation;local oscillator;time-division multiplexing;recursion	EDA	51.76577804006893	77.79035616664441	79047

The preamble signal is used for block synchronization. The following performances are evaluated by theoretical analysis: (1) the data transmission rate; (2) the block error rate when the receiver detects the preamble correctly; (3) the synchronization performances (the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm); (4) the block error rate considering the synchronization performances; and (5) the efficiency. Consequently, the data transmission rate of the SS-PSM system is much higher than that of the conventional spread-spectrum pulse position modulation (SS-PPM) system. The block error rate considering the synchronization performance can reach the lower bound by making use of the preamble. The efficiency of the SS-PSM system is 2 times greater than that of the conventional SS-PPM system.

In this study Chirp z transform based spectrum sensing is proposed for the increase of dispersed spectrum utilization and in this context firstly used in literature. Also with the system model, using inverse fast Fourier transform in transmitter and Chirp z transform in receiver rather than fast Fourier transform, the computational complexity and the processing time are reduced, and performance increase is observed for high signal to noise ratio values.	chirp;cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;fast fourier transform;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Mustafa Namdar;Baris Sahin;Haci Ilhan;Lutfiye Durak-Ata	2012	2012 20th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2012.6204563	computer vision;fast fourier transform;constant q transform;discrete-time fourier transform;cognitive radio;speech recognition;s transform;harmonic wavelet transform;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;short-time fourier transform;continuous wavelet transform;telecommunications;computer science;fractional fourier transform;discrete sine transform;discrete fourier transform;mathematics;spectral density estimation;discrete fourier transform;chirp spread spectrum;bluestein's fft algorithm;non-uniform discrete fourier transform;spectral density;chirp;cyclotomic fast fourier transform	Mobile	51.50449761589648	82.91935635673664	79245

The transmit and receive weight vectors are estimated by using an iterative update algorithm to detect the preceding signal and its delayed versions. The preceding signal and its delayed versions after detection are combined with the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion to maximize the output SINR at the receiver side. This improvement of output SINR is useful for MIMO systems to complement the high-quality for increasing high data rate transmission in broadband wireless communication.	algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;data rate units;iterative method;mimo;mean squared error;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;transmitter	Huy Hoang Pham;Tetsuki Taniguchi;Yoshio Karasawa	2006	Advanced Int'l Conference on Telecommunications and Int'l Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services (AICT-ICIW'06)	10.1109/AICT-ICIW.2006.177	minimum mean square error;transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;channel state information;signal-to-noise ratio;precoding;wireless;statistics;detection theory;mimo	Mobile	47.93786834195334	76.85929441378245	79262

The propagation is assumed to be inversely proportional to a power of the distance from the target and the signal is assumed to be subject to Rayleigh fading and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). As the location and power of the target are unknown, the probability of detection and probability of false alarm are also not known for each individual detectors. Thus, the optimum Chair-Varshney fusion rule does not apply. Instead, a two stage method based on a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is derived and proposed. Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to evaluate the performance of the global fusion rule. The results show that the performance of this fusion scheme is significantly better than the intuitive counting rule.	additive white gaussian noise;coherence (physics);monte carlo method;rayleigh fading;sensor;simulation;software propagation;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Arian Shoari;Alireza Seyedi	2012	MILCOM 2012 - 2012 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415676	electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	39.67255368444312	80.13167750079455	79310

As systems are moving towards multi user and other advanced configurations, it's becoming more important to have accurate CSI at the transmitter (CSIT). In this paper, a double codebook-like mechanism is proposed to enable channel estimation at the transmitter. The novel feedback mechanism and estimation techniques are numerically tested in a time-varying, frequency selective system employing single user MIMO and multi user MIMO. Compared to a LTE Release 8 based scheme, the proposed scheme is seen to (a) provide significantly better multi user MIMO performance when single antenna receivers are employed (b) allow the transmitter to perform multi user MIMO much more frequently.	channel state information;codebook;compaq lte;duplex (telecommunications);emoticon;feedback;frequency divider;mimo;multi-user;numerical analysis;telecommunications link;transmitter	Enoch Lu;Yingxue Li;I-Tai Lu	2012	2012 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2012.6167410	3g mimo;electronic engineering;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	41.460966438723794	83.58838289967417	79558

By truncated power control we mean power control where transmission is interrupted if the channel state deteriorates to bad enough. Inverse power control minimizes the interference that a cognitive radio (CR) creates to licensed users and allows more users to share the spectrum. To further reduce the transmission power and consequently the interference, truncation in power control is used. The performance of the system is improved and the amount of needed transmitted energy is smaller. Based on numerical analysis this new method offers energy efficient transmission, helps to minimize interference to the primary users, and allows even more users to share the same spectrum.	aggregate data;algorithm;beamforming;best, worst and average case;cognitive radio;experiment;interference (communication);interrupt;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;real-time clock;real-time computing;requirement;spectral efficiency;throughput;transmitter;truncation	Marko Höyhtyä;Anant Sahai;Danijela Cabric;Aarne Mämmelä	2007	2007 2nd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications	10.1109/CROWNCOM.2007.4549808	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Mobile	39.570574545316674	87.15385717889347	79645

Conventional methods require periodically transmitted pilot tones in frequency domain or identical training symbols in preamble. To achieve a blind estimation scheme, a joint maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator is proposed by applying another FFT within one symbol duration. Its simplified closed-form solution is then derived to reduce computational complexity. Theoretical analysis and simulation results confirm that the proposed low-complexity scheme achieves almost the same performance as ML estimation and outperforms other blind methods.	carrier frequency offset;computational complexity theory;fast fourier transform;frequency divider;multiplexing;sampling (signal processing);simulation	Xiang Li;Jinming Hu;Wei Heng;Fenyan Yu;Gang Wang	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925909	telecommunications;computer science;statistics	Visualization	50.30186123289919	78.12344243890736	79733
2df3a9935cfac7d59fad08f97ff92d60962ccacf	compressive sensing techniques for next-generation wireless communications		A range of efficient wireless processes and enabling techniques are put under a magnifier glass in the quest for exploring different manifestations of correlated processes, where sub-Nyquist sampling may be invoked as an explicit benefit of having a sparse transform-domain representation. For example, wide-band next-generation systems require a high Nyquist-sampling rate, but the channel impulse response (CIR) will be very sparse at the high Nyquist frequency, given the low number of reflected propagation paths. This motivates the employment of compressive sensing based processing techniques for frugally exploiting both the limited radio resources and the network infrastructure as efficiently as possible. A diverse range of sophisticated compressed sampling techniques is surveyed, and we conclude with a variety of promising research ideas related to large-scale antenna arrays, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and ultra-dense network (UDN) solutions, just to name a few.	algorithm;committed information rate;compressed sensing;computational complexity theory;nyquist frequency;nyquist rate;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;realms;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;software propagation;sparse matrix	Zhen Gao;Linglong Dai;Shuangfeng Han;I Chih-Lin;Zhaocheng Wang;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2018	IEEE Wireless Communications	10.1109/MWC.2017.1700147	computer science;nyquist frequency;compressed sensing;impulse response;distributed computing;wireless;sparse matrix;sampling (statistics);bandwidth (signal processing);electronic engineering;telecommunications;communication channel	Mobile	52.0363020981351	84.10189324351458	79803

Thus, in this paper, we propose the fast spectrum sensing algorithm using the discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) and infinite impulse response (IIR) polyphase filtering schemes.

Ways of overcoming these problems are suggested, and the phase is considered as a parameter to be estimated, as well. Phase estimates are important if multipath components are to be eliminated, or recombined with the direct signal. Cramer-Rao bounds for the estimates of one-path channel parameters (with and without phase) are derived, and final expressions are discussed in light of the influence of phase.	estimation theory;multipath propagation;specular highlight	Zoran I.

At increased complexity, a soft version of SD, so termed list SD (LSD), has been recently applied to coded layered space-time (LST) systems enabling them to approach MIMO channel capacity. By introducing a novel bit-level multistream LST transmitter along with a soft-to-hard decoder conversion, we show how to achieve the near-capacity performance of LSD at reduced complexity, and even outperform it as the size of the block to be decoded (M) increases. Specifically, for binary real LST codes we develop exact max-log based SD schemes with average complexity O(M/sup 4/), and various approximate alternatives trading-off performance for average complexity down to O(M/sup 3/). These schemes apply directly to the real and imaginary parts of QPSK signalling, and also to QAM signalling after incorporating an appropriate interference estimation and cancellation module. We corroborate our reduced-complexity near-optimal soft SD algorithms with simulations.	approximation algorithm;bit-level parallelism;channel capacity;code;imaginary time;interference (communication);mimo;multi-user;secure digital;simulation;transmitter	Renqiu Wang;Georgios B.

Among various solutions, tone injection is an effective approach to mitigate this problem without incurring bandwidth loss. However, due to its computational complexity, finding the optimal tone injection becomes intractable for OFDM systems with a large number of subcarriers. In this work we present a novel convex optimization approach to numerically determine the near-optimal tone injection solution based on a semi-definite relaxation. This approach leads to significant PAPR reduction with polynomial complexity. An STBC-OFDM extension is also proposed.	cobham's thesis;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;frequency divider;linear programming relaxation;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;numerical analysis;power architecture platform reference;semiconductor industry;subcarrier;time complexity;tone mapping;transmitter	Neil Jacklin;Zhi Jun Ding	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937730	convex function;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;discrete mathematics;convex optimization;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;computer science;mathematics	EDA	48.13141308814638	80.65602476714501	80189

32d368840a092630b1833111397b399278c60054	segment-sliding reconstruction of pulsed radar echoes with sub-nyquist sampling		It has been shown that analog-to-information conversion (AIC) is an efficient scheme to perform sub-Nyquist sampling of pulsed radar echoes. However, it is often impractical, if not infeasible, to reconstruct full-range Nyquist samples because of huge storage and computational load requirements. Based on the analyses of AIC measurement system, this paper develops a novel segment-sliding reconstruction (SegSR) scheme to effectively reconstruct the Nyquist samples. The SegSR performs segment-by-segment reconstruction in a sliding mode and can be implemented in real time. An important characteristic that distinguishes the proposed SegSR from existing methods is that the measurement matrix in each segment satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP) condition. Partial support in the previous segment can be incorporated into the estimation of the Nyquist samples in the current segment. The effect of interference introduced from adjacent segments is theoretically analyzed, and it is revealed that the interference consists of two interference levels with different impacts to the signal reconstruction performance. With these observations, a two-step orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) procedure is proposed for segment reconstruction, which takes into account different interference levels and partially known support of the previous segment. The proposed SegSR scheme achieves near-optimal reconstruction performance with a significant reduction of computational loads and storage requirements. Theoretical analyses and simulations verify its effectiveness. 本文提出新的分段滑动重构方法, 并进行深入的理论分析和计算机仿真实验。主要创新点如下:1. 提出一个新的雷达回波信号分段方法, 该方法使得每段测量对应的测量矩阵满足约束等距特性, 从而确保每段信号的可重构性。 2. 深入地理论分析了相邻段对当前段重构性能影响, 揭示了前一段和下一段的干扰特征。3. 根据干扰特征和前一段估计信息, 提出一个两步正交匹配追踪算法, 有效地抑制不同干扰。除外, 我们开展了大量计算机实验, 验证了本文方法的有效性和正确性。	full-range speaker;interference (communication);matching pursuit;nyquist rate;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;online advertising;radar;requirement;restricted isometry property;sampling (signal processing);signal reconstruction;simulation;system of measurement	Suling Zhang;Feng Xi;Shengyao Chen;Yimin Zhang;Zhong Liu	2015	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-015-0602-9	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;control theory;statistics	HPC	51.99796771634513	83.6987331530595	80348

In this paper, we apply the principle of statistical invariance to obtain the optimum TR receiver on a decision-theoretic basis, and it is shown that the autocorrelation receiver is optimal only in a special case. Performance of the optimum receiver and the suboptimum AcR for some important modulation schemes is also evaluated. The results imply that allocating a part of the transmitted energy and bandwidth to reference pulses would not help improve the performance of the system and the optimal performance might be achieved via much simpler non-TR transceiver structures. However, it is shown that differential TR and some other generalizations might be used to boost the performance, and numerical results are provided to assess the degree of performance improvement achieved in each case.	autocorrelation;bandwidth (signal processing);computer performance;modulation;numerical analysis;theory;transceiver;transistor	Mahmoud Farhang;Jawad A.

The RSs will utilize the readily available signal replica and the additional diversity naturally inherent in them to either perform cooperative multipoint (COMP) relaying or remain silent with only the direct transmission being considered. We investigate this scheme in a 7 cell network to demonstrate system level capacity and energy efficiency improvements. Results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional adaptive relay scheme and is able to benefit from the more aggressive full bandwidth frequency reuse plan at low relay transmit power.	autoregressive model;broadcast relay station;cooperative mimo;image processing;inline linking;mobile phone;multi-user mimo;multipoint ground;video coding engine	Ivan Ku;Cheng-Xiang Wang;John S.

We compare the performance and complexity GDFE with MLSE method for different channels used in GSM systems. The GDFE differs from the conventional DFE in its tap values and value of tap feedback filter related with channel length, which discussed in simulation result. Our simulation results, obtained for fading multi path channels, show that the GDFE scheme improves the performance 1 dB approximately in comparison with conventional DFE. The GDFE method is robust to errors channel and this is a good specific beside low complexity, which is applicable in practical systems.	algorithm;equalization (communications);maximum likelihood sequence estimation;recursion;recursive least squares filter;signal processing;simulation;single-sideband modulation;superposition principle	Mahdi Moshfegh;Alireza Rahmati;Abolfazl Hajisami	2011	2011 UkSim 13th International Conference on Computer Modelling and Simulation	10.1109/UKSIM.2011.98	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	EDA	49.24396925271344	75.73004864682557	80733

The proposed channel estimator is performed in two stages. The pre-FFT stage employs the Least Square (LS) estimation and smoothing technique to estimate the Channel Frequency Response (CFR). The post-FFT stage employs this CFR estimate to extract the UW influence and then refines the CFR estimate using a decision feedback technique. Via simulation results, we show that the proposed estimator provides higher performance gain over the conventional LS channel estimator and performs closely to the Linear Minimum Mean-Squared Error (LMMSE) one. Additionally, the computational complexity of our proposal is comparable with the LS approach and significantly lower than that of LMMSE one.	analysis of algorithms;channel state information;computation;computational complexity theory;fast fourier transform;frequency response;least squares;multiplexing;simulation;smoothing;ultra-wideband;x.690	Moufida Hajjaj;Walid Chainbi;Ridha Bouallegue	2016	2016 24th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)	10.1109/SOFTCOM.2016.7772156	electronic engineering;speech recognition;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	49.486640043867666	77.15025189993366	81000

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage-concatenated FTNS system achieves a better error-ratio performance than previous systems that do not consider colored noise effects in the high-symbol-packing FTNS regime. Furthermore, as an explicit benefit of the proposed iterative decoder, near-capacity performance is achieved with practical decoding complexity.	colors of noise;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;decorrelation;iterative method;mean squared error;set packing;simulation;transceiver	Takumi Ishihara;Shinya Sugiura	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7510967	transmitter;colors of noise;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;demodulation;frequency domain;statistics	Robotics	46.36337872624068	74.53019957983032	81443

Leveraging the available millimeter wave spectrum will be important for 5G. In this work, we compare an information theory based analytic result for the achievable rate of digital beamforming systems using low resolution Analog-to-Digital-Converters (ADCs), to a link-level simulation of the same system. For both evaluation methods we include imperfect channel knowledge at the receiver and the effects of the ADC in a wideband multi-user uplink scenario. For the system we choose a configuration defined by 3GPP New Radio (5G). Our results show a performance gap between the two systems, which is comparable to other evaluations of this kind for systems like LTE (4G). In the low-to-medium SNR regime from −20 to 0 dB there is a constant difference of about 4 dB between the two evaluation methods. However, due to a number of effects not modeled in the achievable rate analysis the maximum spectral efficiency saturates at a significantly lower value.	analog-to-digital converter;beamforming;carrier frequency offset;compaq lte;image resolution;information theory;multi-user;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral density;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;uncompressed video	Kilian Roth;Hessam Pirzadeh;A.

The theoretical performance of two different design strategies for MMSE detection are compared. In one case, the MMSE filters are designed separately for each carrier, while in the other case the optimization of the filters is done jointly. Naturally, the joint optimization produces a better receiver, but the difference in performance is shown to be substantial. The multicarrier CDMA performance is then compared to that of a single-carrier CDMA system on a frequency-selective fading channel. A mechanism is then developed to track the channel fading parameters for all the users' signals so that joint optimization of the receiver filters is possible in a time-varying channel. Simulation results show that the performance of this receiver is close to ideal theoretical results for moderate vehicle speeds. The performance begins to degrade when the normalized Doppler rate is higher than about 1%.	mathematical optimization;mean squared error;simulation	Scott L. Miller;Bradley J.

The decision-directed PLL is widely used carrier recovery technique for QPSK, which does not work for higher order QAMs. The reduced-constellation phase locked loop (RC-PLL) was proposed for the case of higher-order QAM. However, its performance in frequency offset detection still does not satisfy the system requirement especially when the offsets are large. In this paper, modified RC-PLL with tracking and hold algorithm (MRC-PLL) is proposed in order to improve the performance of RC-PLL in detecting phase offset as well as frequency offset in higher order QAM. Proposed MRC-PLL provides the acquisition range up to 45 degree phase offset and about up to 10 kHz frequency offset with the reduced acquisition time by half in comparison with RC-PLL.	algorithm;carrier recovery;frequency offset;modulation;phase-locked loop;sensor;system requirements	Chanwoo Park;Jinbeom Lee;Younglok Kim	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378597	carrierless amplitude phase modulation;in-phase and quadrature components;electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;quadrature amplitude modulation;telecommunications;amplitude and phase-shift keying;computer science;engineering;phase-shift keying;control theory;quadrature modulation	Arch	51.48794044549886	78.03150450251024	81917
487acc6606763ab70b39d70e1f1c7d1530096c93	hybrid beamforming for single-user mimo with partially connected rf architecture		Hybrid analog-digital beamforming has been recognized as a promising solution for a practical implementation of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems based on millimeter-wave technology. In this paper, three hybrid beamforming algorithms are proposed for single-user MIMO systems with partially connected radio frequency (RF) architecture, including a singular value decomposition (SVD) matching algorithm, an iterative orthogonalization algorithm, and a transmit-receive zero forcing (ZF) algorithm. The rate performance of the proposed algorithms is compared with fully digital and analog beamforming in a realistic geometry-based stochastic channel model. The simulation results show that the transmit-receive ZF is superior among hybrid methods, and it provides performance relatively close to that of the digital beamforming. In conclusion, carefully designed partially connected hybrid beamforming can obtain an excellent balance between hardware complexity and performance.	algorithm;beamforming;channel (communications);iterative method;mimo;multi-user;radio frequency;simulation;singular value decomposition;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Mohammad Majidzadeh;Aleksi Moilanen;Nuutti Tervo;Harri Pennanen;Antti Tölli;Matti Latva-aho	2017	2017 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)	10.1109/EuCNC.2017.7980696	mimo;architecture;control theory;orthogonalization;beamforming;wsdma;telecommunications;singular value decomposition;precoding;communication channel;computer science	HPC	43.0677675822135	86.71879194533477	81927

Expressions for the variance of estimation error are derived to evaluate the performance of the MAP estimator. The relation between the correlation of subchannels taps and error variance and the effect of signal to noise ratio (SNR) are investigated. The performance of the simplified MAP estimator is analyzed using measured channel data. Approximations are developed in order to make the MAP estimator practical. The simulations show that the proposed estimator operates satisfactorily.	approximation;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier	Selva Muratoglu Çürük;Yalçin Tanik	2007	2007 IEEE 65th Vehicular Technology Conference - VTC2007-Spring	10.1109/VETECS.2007.648	efficient estimator;minimax estimator;minimum-variance unbiased estimator;electronic engineering;bayes estimator;stein's unbiased risk estimate;telecommunications;computer science;trimmed estimator;mean squared error;bias of an estimator;signal-to-noise ratio;consistent estimator;statistics	Robotics	49.51174969477026	76.05524827284775	81942

The cell capacity or the number of users per cell is limited by the interference. In this paper we analyze a new blind adaptive array structure called the spectral correlation discriminator array (SCDA), designed to reject cochannel interference for advanced mobile phone service (AMPS) signals. The blind adaptive array exploits the spectral redundancy in the AMPS signals which arises due to the presence of the supervisory audio tone (SAT). SCDA is shown to provide an improvement of 25–30 dB in signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) in static multipath channels and 10–15 dB improvement of SINR in Rayleigh fading channels. The SCDA is compared to the least squares constant modulus array (LSCMA) and is shown to have better signal selectivity properties. The reduction in interference power can significantly reduce the frequency reuse factor.	cell (microprocessor);discriminator;error analysis (mathematics);flow-based programming;interference (communication);least squares;mean squared error;mobile phone;modulus robot;multipath propagation;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;rejection sampling;selectivity (electronic);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio	Paul Petrus;Jeffrey H.

The sensing structure is flexible such that we can use one or two branches to cope with different SNRs. Under low SNR condition, each branch uses distinct characteristics between noise and signals in the wavelet transform to eliminate the singularities generated by the noise. By using bandpass filter to calculate PSD values of the subbands which are distinguished by the signal’s singularities, the subband with the minimum PSD value among all of the subbands could be found. Then, the results of the two branches are merged and analyzed in order to make the final decision. Finally, we use signal reconstruction to further remove the noise and then accurately detect the spectrum holes. When the SNR is high, only one branch through the denoising procedure is needed to get accurate sensing result. Our simulation results show that the two-branch wavelet method is more accurate than conventional approaches under given SNRs.	cognitive radio;image noise;noise reduction;signal reconstruction;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral density;wavelet transform	Xiaoyan Li;Fei Hu;Hailin Zhang;Chao Shi	2014	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-013-9787-x	mathematical optimization;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;noise reduction;mathematics;wavelet packet decomposition;computer network;wavelet transform	Mobile	50.93410054843254	84.51204665149696	82110

The discrete bit loading algorithms are proposed, which sustain the target bit error rate even under high mean square error (MSE) of estimation. The proposed scheme enhances the robustness of the system against noisy channel estimation without significantly compromising on the system throughput. The results are shown for a power line communication system using a well-known multipath channel model. It is shown that the proposed LP-OFDM allocation is more robust to estimation noise than OFDM allocations and provides higher throughputs even at high MSEs.	bit error rate;channel (communications);channel state information;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency divider;lp-type problem;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;multipath propagation;multiplexing;noisy-channel coding theorem;power-line communication;throughput;x.690	Fahad Syed Muhammad;Jean-Yves Baudais;Jean-François Hélard	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5450145	real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;statistics	Mobile	45.31746640373947	78.25411894729898	82216

In this paper, we propose a new orthogonal beamforming algorithm to achieve high capacity performance in MIMO broadcast channel. In the proposed algorithm, the base station generates a unitary beamforming vector set using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We extend the algorithm of LF-OSDMA (Opportunistic SDMA with Limited Feedback) to guarantee that the system never loses multiplexing gain for fair comparison with the proposed algorithm by informing unallocated beams. Finally, we show that the proposed method can achieve a significantly higher sum capacity than LF- OSDMA and the extended LF- OSDMA without a large increase in the amount of feedback bits and latency.	algorithm;beamforming;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;schmidt decomposition;standard database management analysis;telecommunications link;throughput	Kunitaka Matsumura;Tomoaki Ohtsuki	2011	2011 IEEE 73rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1186/1687-1499-2011-41	high-throughput screening;multi-user mimo;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;base station;distributed computing;precoding;gram–schmidt process;mimo	Mobile	40.38007225430809	84.0188071157974	82224

A rake receiver is used to combine a subset of the resolvable multipath components using the maximal ratio combining technique. Inter-path and multiple-access interferences are modeled and incorporated into the bit-error-rate expressions. The analytical and simulation results allow one to quantify many critical aspects of a DS-PPM UWB system such as the gain of the optimally spaced signaling scheme over the orthogonal signaling scheme, the potential error floor given a specific channel multipath delay spread and the number of interfering users, tolerance of the system to timing jitter, and impact of user codes.	autocorrelation;bit error rate;code;elegant degradation;error floor;maximal set;multipath propagation;pulse-width modulation;rake;simulation;transponder timing;typical set;ultra-wideband;x.690	Mario E.

The carrier phase estimated from a single symbol is corrupted by noise; hence, it is necessary for CPE to average a block of symbols to mitigate the noise effect. Symbols with significant noise in the averaging block can severely distort the overall phase estimation, especially when the averaging block is small. We propose a selective averaging (SA) method to identify those symbols with significantly large noise and exclude them in the phase averaging process of CPE. We apply our proposed SA technique to the decision-aided maximum likelihood (DAML) CPE and demonstrate via Monte Carlo simulation and experimental results that the modified DA-ML has better optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) performance compared to the conventional DAML in large laser linewidth and medium to high OSNR region.	averaging argument;coherence (physics);constant phase element;darpa agent markup language;distortion;monte carlo method;quantum phase estimation algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Dezhao Huang;Tee Hiang Cheng;Changyuan Yu	2013	2013 9th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing	10.1109/ICICS.2013.6782823	telecommunications;maximum likelihood;statistics;monte carlo method	EDA	46.230689431417666	74.75092947025661	82395

Compared with singleuser spectrum sensing, multiple-user spectrum sensing can overcome the impacts caused by the fading environment of cognitive radio. Since diversity technology has been proved to provide the system high transmission rate and high link reliability, we propose a diversity-based multi-antenna cooperative detection model based on the original cooperative detecting model. By introducing the antenna technology, sensing users are equipped with a multi-antenna system. Simulations show that the performance of our proposal is better than that of detection based on single-antenna in cognitive radio network. What’s more, performance of cooperative detection based on multi-antenna is even better than that of cooperative detection based on single-antenna cognitive radio network.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);cognitive radio;computer simulation;experiment;information management;multi-user;sensor	Zhenquan Qin;Wenjing Liu;Huizhen Jiang;Weifeng Sun	2013	JDIM		3g mimo;cognitive radio;antenna diversity;telecommunications;computer science;cooperative diversity	Mobile	41.853971209333196	82.15540448565746	82397

Also, a simplified PET sensing method, which needs to compare only one eigenvalue to its threshold, is introduced. A performance comparison between the proposed method and other existing methods is provided. Spatial antenna correlation at the secondary user is a crucial factor for practical systems.

The channel is time varying within one V-OFDM data-block period, which causes the inter-carrier interference (ICI). With the help of an equivalent V-OFDM system model and an auxiliary transform matrix, a novel mathematical expression for the received signal with the ICI signal is derived, which clearly expresses how the signal of a target vector block (VB) is interfered by other VBs. The ICI signal is analysed and two theorems about its property are proposed. The first theorem presents the expression of the power of the ICI signal, showing that the ICI signal power increases with the VB number. The other one indicates that ICI signals at different subcarriers are not correlated. With the two theorems, a novel detection method utilising the correlation of the ICI signal is therefore proposed. Numerical results verify the validity of the derived theorems and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection can suppress the ICI effect and it is superior to the conventional MMSE detection in terms of both detection mean square error and bit error rate performance.	frequency divider;multiplexing	Wen Zhou;Lisheng Fan;Hongbin Chen	2014	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2013.1064	speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;expression;mathematics	OS	48.44364421632099	79.84049255686789	82648

In order to select concurrent uplink (UL) users with strong channel orthogonality and thus high total capacity, channel state information (CSI) feedback from users is required. However, the inaccurate CSI feedback can seriously influence the efficiency of data transmission. Moreover, due to spontaneous uplink traffic, uplink user s- election cannot rely on the access point central assignment and needs a distributed realization instead, which makes the problem even more challenging. In this paper, we propose a CSI validation algorithm, called CVU, to detect the CSI spoofing of uplink users. CVU requires CSI at transmitting AP to set antenna gains and phases to enable simultaneous verification code distribution through beamforming. Only accurate CSI feedback can user accurately obtains its verification code. AP selects the users with accurate verification codes to obtain their data using a nonlinear equalizer. Our simulation results show that CVU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art user selection methods under CSI spoofing attack.	algorithm;beamforming;card security code;channel state information;equalization (communications);feedback;multi-user mimo;nonlinear acoustics;nonlinear system;simulation;spontaneous order;spoofing attack;telecommunications link;transmitter;wireless access point	Wei Xi;Rong Ma;Yuanhang Cai;Kun Zhao	2015		10.1145/2820716.2820726	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	42.52433092533412	83.57775267520498	82780

It will be shown that the Hamming window far outperforms the rectangular window, and that the interference is for all purposes completely eliminated when the Hamming window is used in conjunction with the overlap and save scheme.

Depending on how it is applied, CS-FAM has one or two steps, allowing for versatility in multiband signal detection and parameter extraction. In the first step, the active sub-bands are detected using multiple measurement vectors (MMVs) and multiuser detection is achieved using a bandwidth constraint. In applications where it is required, such as in estimations of carrier frequency, symbol rate, or modulation format identification, the second step can be used to reconstruct the cyclic spectrums of each user individually. Based on the results of first step, parameter extraction is performed by searching for peaks in the cyclic spectrum rather than by the usual method of setting a threshold. Compared to other cyclic feature detection methods based on sub-Nyquist sampling, CS-FAM is low in complexity, allowing for practical implementation. Based on the results of the first step, parameter extraction from the cyclic spectrum is performed by searching for peaks rather than by setting a threshold. Although CS-FAM can only be employed for multiband signal detection, compared to other cyclic feature detection methods based on sub-Nyquist sampling, it is low in complexity, which makes practical implementation possible. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the robustness of CS-FAM's multiband signal detection and the effectiveness of its cyclic spectrum estimation against both sampling rate reduction and noise uncertainty.	carrier frequency;compressed sensing;computational fluid dynamics;detection theory;fast fourier transform;feature detection (computer vision);feature detection (web development);fuzzy associative matrix;modulation;multi-user;numerical linear algebra;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;simulation;spectral density estimation;stationary process;tree accumulation	Lebing Pan;Shiliang Xiao;Xiaobing Yuan;Baoqing Li	2014	EURASIP J.

44c7613e7dea1f362e37f1b5f41fc116317ff9d6	a hybrid beamforming receiver with two-stage analog combining and low-resolution adcs		In this paper, we propose a two-stage analog combining architecture for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications with hybrid analog/digital beamforming and low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). We first derive a twostage combining solution by solving a mutual information (MI) maximization problem without a constant modulus constraint on analog combiners. With the derived solution, the proposed receiver architecture splits the analog combining into a channel gain aggregation stage followed by a spreading stage to maximize the MI by effectively managing quantization error. We show that the derived two-stage combiner achieves the optimal scaling law with respect to the number of radio frequency (RF) chains and maximizes the MI for homogeneous singular values of a MIMO channel. Then, we develop a two-stage analog combining algorithm to implement the derived solution under a constant modulus constraint for mmWave channels. Simulation results validate the algorithm performance in terms of MI.		Jinseok Choi;G. E. Lee;B. L. Evans	2018	CoRR			ML	42.76945390455102	87.02940916114308	83164

The emergence of interference alignment (IA) provides an effective way to solve this problem. However, in order to utilize the IA algorithm, the real-time and accurate channel state information (CSI) is required at both transmitters and receivers. But in practical IA system, it is hard to get the perfect CSI due to the capacity constraint, channel estimation errors and time delay, which will severely affect the system performance. In this paper, the impact of delayed CSI on average signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and achievable sum rate of IA system are analyzed. To eliminate the effect of delayed CSI, a novel channel predictor based on the linear Markov chain (LMC) is proposed. Using the finite state Markov chain model, the CSI of next time instant can be predicted according to the former and current CSI. Simulation results show that the proposed IA scheme based on LMC predictor can significantly upgrade the performance of IA system with the delayed CSI, and it can achieve better results with lower complexity compared with traditional AR predictor.	algorithm;broadcast delay;channel state information;cognitive radio;emergence;interference (communication);kerrison predictor;little man computer;markov chain;real-time clock;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;transmitter	Zhenguo Shi;Zhilu Wu;Zhendong Yin;Shufeng Zhuang	2014	2014 International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)	10.1109/WPMC.2014.7014851	transmitter;simulation;doppler effect;telecommunications;mathematics;interference;markov process;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	Mobile	41.59297123447842	83.51227476991623	83205

66065b09e92c57c52b9770d1d7bd9fd04efbd795	a novel method of signal fusion based on dimension expansion		A novel method of signal fusion, namely multi-dimensional unified signal (MDUS) fusion algorithm, is proposed based on dimensionality expansion of the cognitive radio (CR). The paper focuses on the issue of under-utilized and overcrowded spectrum bands in CR, through multi-component signal fusion. The proposed MDUS fusion algorithm can meet the basic requirement of signal fusion, that is, transmitting multi-component signal in one signal simultaneously, while basic signal elements, such as amplitude and bit rate, are not constrained by the fusion. The one-dimensional imaginary domain of the signal can be expanded to two, three or higher-dimensional imaginary space by exploiting the property of logical recursion. The original data flows can be extended to three, four or higher dimensions according to functional demands. Thus, the complementary aims of mutually independent orthogonal space and multivariate signal transmission without interference, are achieved by fusing multiple uni-dimensional signals into a multi-dimensional signal. Hence, based on the electromagnetic environment, a more flexible solution can be provided for spectrum occupancy of CR users. Specifically, the number of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) sub-bands and MDUS dimension can be dynamically converted, based on the MDUS–OFDM structure. The proposed approach can be utilized to provide more accurate estimation and prediction of transmission quality for CR Networks. Simulation results show the MDUS offers both BER and dimensionality advantage compared to the OFDM. Additionally, single-dimensional spectrum patterns can be expanded to alterable multi-dimensional spectrum patterns owing to the flexibility of MDUS–OFDM structure.

168c4e71aebd18a5a4c80e6fc63df1720fd51f9b	sub-nyquist spectrum sensing based on modulated wideband converter in cognitive radio sensor networks		The large-scale deployment of wireless sensor networks is indispensable to the success of Internet of Things. Considering dynamic spectrum access and the limited spectrum resources in cognitive radio sensor networks, sub-Nyquist spectrum sensing based on the modulated wideband converter is introduced. Since the transmission signals are usually modulated by different carrier frequencies, the interested spectrum can be modeled as the multiband signal. Modulated wideband converter (MWC) is an attractive alternative among several sub-Nyquist sampling systems because it has been implemented in practice and the frequency support reconstruction algorithm is the most important part in MWC. However, most existing reconstruction methods require the sparse information, which is difficult to acquire in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a blind multiband signal reconstruction method, referred to as the statistics multiple measurement vectors (MMV) iterative algorithm to bypasses the above problem. By exploiting the jointly sparse property of MMV model, the supports can be obtained by statistical analysis for the reconstruction results. Simulation results show that, without the sparse prior, the statistics MMV iterative algorithm can accurately determine the support of the multiband signal in a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio by using various numbers of sampling channels.	algorithm;carrier wave;cognitive radio;internet of things;iterative method;modulation;multiply-with-carry;multiuse model view;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;sampling (signal processing);signal reconstruction;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software deployment;sparse matrix	Xue Wang;Min Jia;Xuemai Gu;Qing Guo	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2859229	reconstruction algorithm;wireless sensor network;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;cognitive radio;computer science;distributed computing;frequency modulation;wideband;communication channel;signal reconstruction;electronic engineering	Mobile	52.01085483614821	83.89110661451662	83724

The presence of NBI characterizes many practical contexts, including cellular applications and emerging spectrum sharing systems, where coexistence of different types of wireless services over the same frequency band may result into remarkable co-channel interference. The coding scheme is the bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM). Conventional maximum likelihood (ML) decision strategies for BICM-OFDM transmissions suffer from significant performance degradation in the presence of NBI. To overcome this difficulty, in this work we develop a new bit-metric for the decoding of the transmitted data that achieves near-optimum results.	algorithm;coexist (image);colors of noise;computer simulation;decoding methods;download;elegant degradation;frequency band;interference (communication);list of code lyoko episodes;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multiplexing;noise power	Michele Morelli;Marco Moretti	2010	2010 2nd International Workshop on Cognitive Information Processing	10.1109/CIP.2010.5604218	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	45.1876603655994	77.81066827546657	83727

By using computer simulations, the synchronization performances of the traditional SPS and the new proposed SPS algorithms are evaluated in terms of their probabilities of synchronization failure.	algorithm;computer simulation;dvb-h;digital video broadcasting;frequency divider;frequency offset;handheld game console;ibm 1401 symbolic programming system;multiplexing;performance;sampling (signal processing);ubiquitous computing	Won-Jae Shin;Young-Hwan You	2009	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2009.5277963	computer simulation;synchronization;electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science	Visualization	47.41272608684679	78.91607641981527	83763

However, WPMCM is sensitive and vulnerable to time synchronization errors because its symbols overlap. In this paper, we design new wavelets to alleviate WPMCM’s vulnerability to timing errors. First, a filter design framework that facilitates the development of new wavelet bases is built. Then the expressions for errors due to time offset in WPMCM transmission are derived and stated as a convex optimization problem. Finally, an optimal filter that best handles these deleterious effects is designed by means of Semi Definite Programming (SDP). Through computer simulations the performance advantages of the newly designed filter over standard wavelet filters are proven.	autocorrelation;computer simulation;convex optimization;filter design;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;modulation;optimization problem;semiconductor industry;wavelet	Dzemal Karamehmedovic;Madan Kumar Lakshmanan;Homayoun Nikookar	2009	GLOBECOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425608	computer simulation;synchronization;convex optimization;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;filter bank;control theory;mathematics;wavelet packet decomposition;filter design;correlation;semidefinite programming;wavelet transform;modulation	Visualization	50.05974441030882	83.5793999953128	83879

This choice has provoked a growing interest in this transmission technology; therefore, there is extensive literature on its performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) and PAPR. However, research on its spectral efficiency has been scarce until now. This paper aims to help fill this gap with an analytical study of the spectral efficiency in SC-FDMA when adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) and linear frequency-domain equalization are applied. This paper therefore computes the spectral efficiency for zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum-mean-square-error frequency-domain equalization (MMSE-FDE) for different Nakagami-m fading channels.	adobe framemaker;advanced mezzanine card;bit error rate;carrier frequency;compaq lte;frequency response;modulation;overhead (computing);power architecture platform reference;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;telecommunications link;verification and validation;x.690;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Juan Jesús Sánchez Sánchez;M.

6c40beb28dd535d4ebb2cc8196607288249294dd	a novel trellis-coded differential chaotic modulation system		In this paper, a novel coded modulation scheme named Trellis-Coded Differential Chaotic Modulation (TC-DCM) is proposed, which combines trellis codes with M-ary Differential Chaotic Shift Keying (M-DCSK). The new scheme not only reduces the multipath interference efficiently due to its inherent spreading property, but also avoids the use of Channel State Information (CSI), exact synchronization, despreading and the Rake receiver, making the corresponding receiver design simpler and more suitable for band-limited communication systems under severe multipath propagation conditions. Analytical Bit-Error-Rate (BER) bounds are derived and verified over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels. Both analytical performances and simulation results show that the proposed scheme with different states and different coding rates can obtain significant coding gains, compared to the corresponding uncoded schemes with the same bandwidth over AWGN channels. In addition, it is found from simulations that over multipath Rayleigh fading channels without CSI, the proposed TC-DCM system outperforms the Trellis-Coded Modulation Direct-Sequence Spread-Spectrum (TCM DS/SS) system with the same bandwidth efficiency.	additive model;additive white gaussian noise;bandlimiting;bit error rate;catastrophic interference;channel state information;communications satellite;computer cooling;convolutional code;dicom;interference (communication);key (cryptography);modulation;multipath propagation;performance;rake;rayleigh fading;simulation;software propagation;spectral efficiency;trellis quantization;x.690	Yanchun He;Lin Wang;Chenglong Zhou;Guanrong Chen	2017	2017 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium (WTS)	10.1109/WTS.2017.7943522	modulation;multipath propagation;multipath interference;channel state information;additive white gaussian noise;rake receiver;keying;mathematics;spectral efficiency;control theory	Security	44.649331768777415	79.3788059104361	83943

Our results apply to a wide class of multichannel systems which transmit on the eigenmodes of the MIMO channel, allowing for transmission on any arbitrary number of eigensubchannels, with possibly different modulation formats, and with possibly unequal powers. New exact expressions are derived for the symbol error rate (SER) of each eigensubchannel, the global SER, and the outage probability. We also present simplified closed-form expressions for the high SNR regime, and show that cochannel interference has no effect on the diversity order, but leads to a loss in array gain.

As a result, it is verified by theoretical analysis and numerical results that the proposed scheme achieves the upper-bound performance in correlated antenna arrays, and is robust to failures and calibration errors of radio frequency chains. Moreover, the proposed scheme is a low-cost and power-efficient solution by making full use of the power amplifiers.	amplifier;angularjs;audio power amplifier;beamforming;compaq lte;complementarity theory;mimo;numerical analysis;radio frequency;randomness;smart antenna	Wei Jiang;Xuezhi Yang	2012	2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2012.6362693	omnidirectional antenna;calibration;collinear antenna array;time–frequency analysis;bit error rate;telecommunications;directional antenna;smart antenna;mathematics;beamforming	Embedded	39.778417873391696	82.9006114363945	84427

0381a636ad53d063d5fd4983ad1211cc3c3c2560	fast cooperative energy detection under accuracy constraints in cognitive radio networks		Cooperative energy detection (CED) is a key technique to identify the spectrum holes in cognitive radio networks. Previous study on this technique mainly aims at improving the detection accuracy, while paying little attention to the performance of detection time.This paper concentrates on the issue of fast CED, which is achieved byminimizing its detection time subject to the constraints on detection accuracy. Firstly, the prevalent counting rule based CED algorithm is optimized. Taking the special cases of counting rule (AND rule and OR rule), for example, we show that detection time can be minimized by selecting an optimal number of secondary users. Moreover, we prove that OR rule is superior to AND rule in detection time, and thus OR rule based CED is faster than AND rule based CED. Then, a sequential test (ST) based CED algorithm is proposed to exploit the benefit of ST and detect primary user even faster. After analyzing its detection time, we illustrate that ST based CED is able to spend the minimal detection time in satisfying the accuracy constraints by choosing an optimal sample number. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of both fast algorithms discussed in this paper.

Two new PN mitigation techniques are proposed, especially targeted for reducing the intercarrier interference (ICI) effects due to PN. The first proposed method is a fairly simple one, stemming from the idea of linearly interpolating between two consecutive common phase error (CPE) estimates to obtain a linearized estimate of the time-varying phase characteristics. The second technique, in turn, is an extension to the existing state-of-the-art ICI estimation methods. Here the idea is to use an additional interpolation stage to improve the phase estimation performance around the boundaries of two consecutive OFDM symbols. The paper also verifies the performance improvement of these new PN estimation techniques by comparing them to the existing state-of-the-art techniques using extensive computer simulations. To emphasize practicality, the simulations are carried out in 3GPP-LTE downlink -like system context, covering both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and extended ITU-R Vehicular A multipath channel types.	additive white gaussian noise;catastrophic interference;compaq lte;computer simulation;constant phase element;ddos mitigation;distortion;ici (programming language);interference (communication);iterative method;li-chen wang;linear interpolation;multipath propagation;oscillator phase noise;performance;phase-locked loop;quantum phase estimation algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;stemming;telecommunications link;test engineer;utility functions on indivisible goods	Ville Syrjälä;Mikko Valkama;Nikolay N.

In this paper, an efficient linear precoder based on the maximization of the minimum Euclidean distance between two received data vectors for three data-stream MIMO spatial multiplexing systems is proposed. By using a singular value decomposition, the precoding matrix can be parameterized as the product of a power allocation matrix and an input shaper matrix. According to this representation, the optimal precoders are proposed for the case of three independent data-streams. Simulation results over Rayleigh fading channels show considerable bit-error-rate improvement with the proposed solution in comparison with other precoding strategies.	bit error rate;channel state information;download;euclidean distance;expectation–maximization algorithm;mimo;rayleigh fading;simulation;singular value decomposition;spatial multiplexing;transmitter	Quoc-Tuong Ngo;Olivier Berder;Pascal Scalart	2012	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2012.052412.110702	transmitter;3g mimo;spatial correlation;telecommunications;computer science;zero-forcing precoding;euclidean distance;control theory;feedback;mathematics;spatial multiplexing;precoding;multiplexing;mimo	Visualization	39.29320726196762	84.08665000019894	85386

Unlike classical decorrelating and minimum mean-square error linear multiuser detectors, the new receivers exploit the information contained in the pseudoautocorrelation of the observables, and are, thus, capable of achieving much better performance. In this letter, we present new results on the performance analysis of this class of new receivers. In particular, with reference to a CDMA system with deterministic spreading codes, we show that the new receivers outperform the classical ones in terms of both error probability and near–far resistance. With regard, instead, to CDMA systems with random spreading, we compute the average system near–far resistance, showing that the new receivers can accommodate twice the number of users accommodated by the classical linear multiuser receivers.	code;decorrelation;delta modulation;key (cryptography);multi-user;observable;profiling (computer programming);sensor	Stefano Buzzi;Marco Lops	2003	IEEE Trans.

cd5f26dbca36fcddb67703bb3c4272e24e9728c5	mitigating co-channel interference using transmitter pre-processing for double space-time transmit diversity aided idma system		A double space-time transmit-diversity (DSTTD) architecture achieves higher throughput by employing four transmit antennas and four receive antennas. In this article, we compute Error-Rate (ER) performance of DSTTD-Interleave-division multiple-access (IDMA) system using Multi-user transmitter pre-processing (MUTP) for standard channel models. We realize MUTP using SVD technique to mitigate Co-channel interference (CCI) effects apart from Multi-user Interference (MUI), which are considered to be major channel impairments. The MUTP exploits the signal space of the entire active user’s channel state information (CSI). We estimate CSI and quantize using vector quantization at each mobile unit and formulate TP by recovering at base station. Our simulation result reveals that considered system with MUTP technique achieves better ER with less SNR while offering high data rate for downlink transmission. Further, we observe that the ER performance of our considered system depends on code book size of vector quantized parameters. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We also provide a novel technique, which utilizes the channel''s correlation, for recovering the pilot sequence, and show that we can achieve accurate channel and side information estimation even at relatively low S$R values. Additionally, the impact of various sequence types on the pilot sequence detectability are investigated under different scenarios. It will be demonstrated here that the proposed method can successfully work and used in a number of applications.	channel state information;convolutional code;feedback;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-noise ratio;subcarrier	Emad Alsusa;A.

During high speed and distance transmission signal fades below a definite level due to transmission impairments; Bit error rate (BER) increases rapidly that degrades the system performance. In this work, a novel signal regeneration technique is proposed for 60 Gb/s differential phase shift keying transceiver system that transmits and receives the highspeed signal over single mode fiber at transmission distance of 300 km. The designed system is modeled mathematically and its real time simulation are demonstrated. It is examined that novel proposed technique is significantly regenerating the signal for 300 km fiber length. The proposed technique has achieved the BER of 10 with eye open diagram in the presence of high amplitude noise, phase noise and dispersion per kilometer in optical fiber transmission. At the receiver, the proposed system has adequately mitigated the amplitude noise up to 88% and phase noise up to 89% from the transmitted signal. The proposed system will be helpful for system design engineer to design high-speed communication with required BER before its physical realization to provide quality performance for future generation high-speed communication system.	bit error rate;diagram;differential phase;gigabyte;key (cryptography);mimo;modulation;optical fiber;phase noise;pre-shared key;real-time computing;signal regeneration;simulation;soliton;systems design;transceiver;x.690	Bhagwan Das;Mohammad Faiz Liew Abdullah;Bhawani Shankar Chowdhry;Nor Shahida Mohd Shah	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-017-4351-8	phase noise;real-time computing;communications system;computer science;bit error rate;single-mode optical fiber;amplitude;differential phase;signal regeneration;electronic engineering;keying	EDA	45.46621416160947	84.27039946291936	86370

With the help of received chunk of data and the extracted watermark, which is actually extracted version of the selected chunk of data, the channel is equalized by using Normalized LMS algorithm. In this method, neither receiver requires to know the training sequence in advance nor the sender requires to send training sequence.

Several spectrum sensing algorithms based on energy detection, matched filtering and autocorrelation based feature detection have therefore been proposed in the literature. All these algorithms tend to have higher complexity for achieving better sensing performance, which requires higher computing power and/or more sensing time. Moreover they are not flexible enough to dynamically trade complexity with sensing performance. In this paper, we present a novel low-complexity spectrum sensing technique based on correlation of intra-segment decimated vectors. The primary signal to be detected is sampled at a particular frequency, and digitized samples are segmented and decimated by suitable decimation index. The means of resulting vectors are correlated to detect the presence of the signal. MATLAB simulations of the proposed technique have been carried out to validate the proposed technique. Single-tone and Multi-tone signal at a 25MHz IF frequency and ATSC DTV (in UHF) signal and PAL-B Analog TV (in VHF) signal are down-converted to 25MHz IF frequency, and used to validate the proposed detection technique. Not only the proposed scheme is found to able to detect the presence of a signal effectively, but also the complexity of the proposed scheme is only nearly 1/10th of the complexity (for vector length n = 10) of the simplest of the existing correlation based technique.	atsc standards;algorithm;analog television;autocorrelation;cognitive radio;decimation (signal processing);feature detection (computer vision);feature detection (web development);higher computing;matlab;pal;simulation;ultra high frequency	Syed Naveen Altaf Ahmed;Pramod Kumar Meher;A.

As the pre- and postfilters are not paraunitary, the output signal-to-noise ratio is degraded compared to QR-based beamforming. We investigate the role of the postfilter on the noise enhancement and propose a simple and efficient solution. We show that a simple normalisation of the postfilter, using row balancing, is sufficient to significantly improve the conditioning of the system and thereby, the performance of the system. With the resulting performance increase, the LU-based polynomial matrix decomposition for MIMO beamforming becomes competitive as compared to its QR-based counterparts, in terms of bit error rate, for medium input SNR.	beamforming;bit error rate;gaussian elimination;lu decomposition;mimo;polynomial matrix;signal-to-noise ratio	Mamadou Mboup;Moussa Diallo;Moustapha Mbaye	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953013	mimo;bit error rate;mathematical optimization;polynomial matrix;matrix decomposition;beamforming;conditioning;signal-to-noise ratio;gaussian elimination;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	48.94953472355464	81.74908694971793	86781

Furthermore, the frequency-offset error is separately compensated by using an adaptive minimization of a fourth-order statistics based cost function.	algorithm;frequency offset;heterodyne;in-phase and quadrature components;intermediate frequency;loss function	Shafayat Abrar;Azzedine Zerguine;Asoke K.

26fe1a1c87742b1fa7ff5c702c49d6c3454e2704	fast compression of ofdm channel state information with constant frequency sinusoidal approximation		We propose CSIApx, a very fast and lightweight method to compress the Channel State Information (CSI) of Wi-Fi networks. CSIApx approximates the CSI vector as the linear combination of a small number of base sinusoids on constant frequencies, and uses the complex coefficients of the base sinusoids as the compressed CSI. While it is well- known that the CSI vector can be represented as the linear combination of sinusoids, fixing the frequencies of the base sinusoids is the key novelty of CSIApx, which is guided by our mathematical finding that almost any sinusoid can be approximated by the same set of base sinusoids with small bounded error. CSIApx enjoys very low computation complexity, because the key steps in the compression can be pre-computed. We extensively test CSIApx with both experimental and synthesized Wi-Fi channel data, and the results confirm that CSIApx can achieve very good compression ratio with little loss of accuracy.	approximation algorithm;channel state information;coefficient;computation;network performance;precomputation	Avishek Mukherjee;Zhenghao Zhang	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254927	algorithm;real-time computing;compression ratio;channel state information;computation;computer science;linear combination;computational complexity theory;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;matrix decomposition;communication channel	Mobile	51.92251657861234	81.20275773153598	86883

Our aim is to introduce a new receiver for STBC MIMO-OFDM transmission over Rayleigh fading channels using Zernike moments which apply either k-nearest neighbor (KNN) or support vector machine (SVM) for classification. The detrimental effects of multipath on the transmitted symbols are alleviated using invariance to rotation, and scaling properties of the Zernike moments. The performance of the new method is shown in symmetric α-stable (SaS) and Middleton noise environments.	channel (communications);image scaling;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multipath propagation;rayleigh fading;semiconductor industry;support vector machine	Mostafa Nosrati;Hamidreza Amindavar	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - ICASSP '07	10.1109/ICASSP.2007.366537	support vector machine;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;mathematics	Robotics	46.107461058905606	77.08351339323197	87027

Furthermore, detailed analyses on performance of the decoders are given. These show that, for any integer k, 1 ≤ k ≤ K (K is the number of users), there is an affine projection decoder such that its diversity order is M - K + k, while its decoding complexity is higher than linear decoders (if k > 1), and lower than Maximum-Likelihood (ML) decoder (if k <; K). Hence, any diversity order between M - K + 1, which is the diversity order of linear decoders and M, which is one of ML decoder, can be realized, while decoding complexity is also increased with the increase of the diversity order.	mimo;performance;telecommunications link	Haiquan Wang;Liniin Hou;Luping Ma;Lei Shen	2012	2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542832	electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics;communication	Robotics	44.576199554079736	78.62453564191314	87054

Since users are asynchronous in this scenario, signal in one hop of the desired users is affected by partial signals in unaligned hops, called the interference fragments, of the interfering users. We address the interference model by defining a virtual user, which has the same hopping pattern as that of the desired user and contains the feature of the interfering fragments. Then, we derive the joint interference reconstruction and multiple-user detection (MUD) algorithm using the factor graph framework. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm can be improved by up to 2 dB than that of the traditional single user detection (SUD) in AWGN at the packet error rate of 10−2 for a total of 8 users over 20 hopping frequencies, and an outstanding performance may also be achieved in the channel with Doppler.

0741ffc3a0ebff27ffc8dc2f448cd8dce72885ac	iterative channel estimation algorithm based on compressive sensing for gfdm		Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) is a promising solution for the cellular system of the fifth generation (5G) PHY layer because its flexibility can address the different application requirements. However, due to the pulse shaping, there is inherent interference existing in the received signal, which has a negative impact on pilot-based channel estimation. Although the interference on the pilot symbols can be eliminated at the transmitter by using precoding matrices, the accompanied transmitting power penalty increases with the non-orthogonality of subcarriers and subsymbols. In our work, we propose an iterative method for interference cancellation at the receiver, which can efficiently mitigate the effect of neighboring symbols on pilots without transmitting power penalty. In addition, to improve the accuracy of channel estimation, we adopt the compressive sensing (CS) technology. Simulation results show that our proposed channel estimation algorithm is efficient even when the interference is severe, and by using orthogonal match pursuit (OMP) recovery algorithm, the performance of our algorithm can be close to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB).	algorithm;channel state information;compressed sensing;fifth generation computer;interference (communication);iterative method;mimo;multiplexing;noise shaping;openmp;phy (chip);performance;pulse shaping;requirement;simulation;subcarrier;transmitter	Jinnian Zhang;Yan Li;Kai Niu	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)	10.1109/ICNIDC.2016.7974573	iterative method;single antenna interference cancellation;compressed sensing;frequency-division multiplexing;pulse shaping;interference (wave propagation);precoding;algorithm;computer science;communication channel	Mobile	48.23765892112106	80.2173104645877	87394

In fast-varying channels, because of the propagation and estimation delays, and the short channel coherence time, both the feedback information and the estimated CSI may become outdated at the transmit instant, leading to a reduction in power control performance. In this paper, a new channel prediction-based adaptive power control technique is proposed for uplink transmission in Time Division Duplex (TDD) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Based on the predicted Channel Impulse Responses (CIRs) provided by a cluster-based time- domain channel predictor, the transmit power is allocated to each OFDM subcarrier and then, a global gain is applied to compensate for the propagation path loss. In doing this, the power control process does not rely on the feedback information from the BS nor the estimated CSI at the MS and thus, the system responsiveness, adaptivity, and power savings are improved.	channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);kerrison predictor;multiplexing;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;performance per watt;quality of service;requirement;responsiveness;software propagation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;test-driven development	Viet-Ha Pham;Xianbin Wang;Md.

Two different approaches based on the zero forcing (ZF) and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criteria have been investigated. We have compared our frequency domain approach with the classical RAKE, considering an illustrative scenario where a base station transmits to several mobile terminals in an indoor environment characterized by severe multipath propagation. The results show that the receiver based on the MMSE criterion achieves the best performance with respect to the other schemes, irrespective of the number of active terminals. Hence, the proposed approach is well suited in indoor wireless environment where multipath propagation tends to increase the effects of both the inter-path and the inter-user interference.	akaike information criterion;interference (communication);mean squared error;multipath propagation;rake;sensor;software propagation;transmitter;ultra-wideband;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Simone Morosi;Tiziano Bianchi	2004	2004 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (IEEE Cat.

Extending the orthogonalized spatial multiplexing (OSM) scheme which was developed recently for transmitting two data streams, we propose a new SM scheme where a larger number of data streams can be supported. To achieve this goal, we partition the data streams into several subblocks and execute the block-diagonalization process at the receiver. The proposed scheme still guarantees single- symbol maximum likelihood (ML) detection with small feedback information. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme achieves a huge performance gain at a bit error rate (BER) of 10-4 over conventional closed-loop schemes based on minimum mean-square error (MSE) or bit error rate (BER) criterion. We also show that an additional 2.5 dB gain can be obtained by optimizing the group selection with extra feedback information.	bit error rate;decibel;mimo;mean squared error;openstreetmap;simulation;spatial multiplexing;transmitter;x.690	Sung Hyun Moon;Heunchul Lee;Young-Tae Kim;Inkyu Lee	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.749	minimum mean square error;group selection;bit error rate;computer science;theoretical computer science;control theory;mathematics;maximum likelihood;data stream mining;spatial multiplexing;multiplexing;statistics	Mobile	39.945038063156346	84.23233556086315	87564

However, the user is usually equipped with a small number of antennas due to space constraints. Thus, multi-user beamforming (MU-BF) was proposed to dramatically boost the spectrum efficiency by transmitting multiple users' data on the same time-frequency resource. The co-channel interference (CCI) among users scheduled on the same resource can be eliminated by block diagonalization (BD); however, the performance of downlink MU-BF with BD relies on the accuracy of channel estimation to a great extent. Therefore, the effect of imperfect channel estimation on MU-BF for the downlink of LTE-Advanced system is studied in this paper. The reference signal targeting data demodulation (DM-RS) and uplink sounding reference signal (SRS) for deriving the downlink channel in TDD system are considered with different error models respectively. The estimation errors are modeled through link level simulations. It is shown that the imperfect SRS and DM-RS channels degrade the system performance in different degree through system level simulation.	automatic sounding;beamforming;blu-ray;brainfuck;cosmo-rs;catastrophic interference;channel state information;compaq lte;gaussian elimination;interference (communication);multi-user;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;test-driven development;transmitter	Jing Jin;Chongsheng Lin;Qixing Wang;Hongwen Yang;Yafeng Wang	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493794	electronic engineering;real-time computing;time–frequency analysis;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer performance;statistics	Mobile	42.581140409026965	82.47637283522764	87690

Multiple-user interference, shot-noise, and receiver thermal noise effects on the pbe are studied in detail. One-coincidence optical orthogonal codes and prime codes are considered in the numerical analysis. Equal-weight orthogonal signaling formats that do not require dynamic estimation of the receiver threshold are proposed. Our results suggest that equal-weight orthogonal signaling schemes are preferable to the on-off orthogonal signaling schemes commonly employed in the literature.	approximation;auditory processing disorder;avalanche effect;bit error rate;cell signaling;chernoff bound;code;interference (communication);johnson–nyquist noise;numerical analysis;on-off keying;profiling (computer programming);shot noise	Alex W.

The IEEE is developing the 802.22 standard for spectral reuse in TV bands that uses cognitive radio (CR) technology. One of the essential and challenging features of CR is spectrum sensing. This paper proposes a novel spectrum sensing algorithm using spectral covariance of the received signal. The proposed spectral covariance sensing (SCS) algorithm exploits different statistical correlations of the signal and noise in the frequency domain. Test statistics are computed from the covariance matrix of spectrogram and compared with the decision threshold. Detection performance is theoretically analyzed and verified through extensive simulation according to the IEEE 802.22 requirements. We show that SCS achieved 3dB better sensitivity to pilot location detector with the same sensing time. It is also shown that SCS is very robust to the noise uncertainty, which is one of the critical performance measures of spectrum sensing. The results of the paper suggest that SCS is an efficient and viable sensing scheme for IEEE 802.22 systems.	algorithm;cognitive radio;requirement;simulation;spectral density;spectrogram	Jaeweon Kim;Jeffrey G.

Unfortunately traditional schemes fail to balance between accuracy and complexity, which are the key indicators for the performance of spectrum sensing. In this paper, a new spectrum sensing scheme based on phase difference is proposed. Through analyzing the distributions of phase difference between adjacent samples of noise and noise-perturbed primary signal, we notice that the mean of phase difference varies from noise when primary signal is present. On this basis, a novel sensing scheme using the accumulation of phase difference as test statistics is formulated. Then the analytical performance of our scheme is derived and its complexity is analyzed. Our proposed scheme is simple, accurate and immune to noise uncertainty. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms conventional energy detection and can achieve a detection probability of 99% at -7dB signal-to-noise ratio using 500 data samples.	auditory processing disorder;cognitive radio;complexity;modulation;noise power;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;tree accumulation	Jian Yang;Xiao Yan;Mingfei Gao;Hao Lian;Han Zhang;Zhiyong Feng;Yifan Zhang	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6951978	gaussian noise;noise spectral density;noise;signal transfer function;telecommunications;noise temperature;noise measurement;quantum noise;direct-sequence spread spectrum;noise;noise;noise figure;noise floor;signal-to-noise ratio;phase noise;stochastic resonance;carrier-to-receiver noise density;statistics	Mobile	49.99046558082659	84.88355791036454	87848

Given this signaling, the effective channel matrix for the received signal is banded, allowing for the modification of prior methods of equalization for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing over narrowband LTV channels. Performance of such equalizers and signaling is provided via simulation and shown to offer good performance coupled with high spectral efficiency over previously proposed designs.	frequency divider;multiplexing;orthogonal wavelet;simulation;spectral efficiency;time complexity	Tinghui Xu;Geert Leus;Urbashi Mitra	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5946246	statistical time division multiplexing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory	EDA	46.58787371268184	81.85204247017789	88147

It also presents a closed-form expression for the power loss of SC compared to maximal ratio combining (MRC) over a Nakagami- m fading channel. It is found that this power gap is a function of only the number (L) of independent Nakagami-m channels and the fading parameter m. For a fixed m, the gap monotonically increases with L. For a fixed L, the gap monotonically increases with m and approaches 10 log10 L dB (the asymptotic gap between MRC and SC in an AWGN channel) as m ¿ ¿. In addition, numerical results show the accuracy of the ASERs obtained from closed-form expressions for both MRC and SC with MPSK and MQAM signals for large SNRs. They also show that the SNR gap is identical to that predicted by the analysis for arbitrary L and m.	additive white gaussian noise;asymptote;gap theorem;maximal set;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio	Ning Kong;Laurence B.

We design the OFDM symbol as a concatenation of two sub-blocks. The first one is shorter and carries out few data with few subcarriers whereas the second one contains both informative and pilot symbols. The first sub-block serves to estimate the Doppler scaling factor while the pilots in the second sub-block are used for estimating the equivalent channel. Both estimation approaches are based on high resolution methods for solving harmonic retrieval problems in time and frequency domains respectively. Each sub-block contains a cyclic suffix, which allows having more data to be processed. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated by means of simulation results.	acoustic cryptanalysis;concatenation;doppler effect;image resolution;image scaling;information;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Alain Y.

In this paper, we propose a low-complexity PAPR reduction scheme for SFBC MIMO-OFDM systems, where the input sequence is multiplied by a set of phase rotation vectors respectively and then each resulting sequence is decomposed into several sub-sequences based on the linear property of SFBC. After computing the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) to convert each frequency-domain sub-sequence into a time-domain signal, we perform equivalent SFBC encoding operations in the time domain for generating candidate signal sets, where the one with the lowest maximum PAPR is selected for transmission. With the proposed scheme, we can generate a large number of candidate signal sets by computing only a few IFFTs. As compared to previous related schemes, the proposed one achieves similar PAPR reduction performance with much lower computational complexity.	computation;computational complexity theory;fast fourier transform;frequency divider;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;power architecture platform reference;spatial light modulator	Chin-Liang Wang;Shun-Sheng Wang;Hsiao-Ling Chang	2011	2011 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2011.5779373	telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;frequency domain;statistics	HPC	46.83857424777837	80.87894972542881	88843

Specifically, the cyclostationary pilot signature of an IEEE 802.16e standard compliant waveform is investigated. The proposed scheme performs waveform identification through a preamble cross-correlation technique. Classification is achieved through the use of a pilot cross-correlation technique in combination with cyclostationary feature extraction in order to determine the cyclic prefix of the IEEE 802.16e waveform. Similar methods are then used for determining other OFDMA waveform parameters, such as the FFT size, Segment number and IDcell. MATLAB simulation results validate the preamble cross-correlation and pilot cross-correlation techniques as effective methods of signal identification and classification, respectively.	cellular automaton;cross-correlation;cyclostationary process;fast fourier transform;feature extraction;ieee 754-1985;ieee 802.1aq;matlab;simulation;waveform	Ryan Gray;Murali Tummala;John C.

Based on the random matrix theory, we propose principal component sequence as a discriminating feature, which is detected by sliding window in the frequency-domain. With this feature, Euclidean distance is employed for decision making. The proposed algorithm does not need priori knowledge of the signal parameters such as channel coefficients, the modulation mode or noise power. Meanwhile, this algorithm is compatible to identify single-antenna systems and spatial multiplexing of different orders without another module. Moreover, the simulations show the proposed algorithm adapts to multipath fading effectively with a short observation period.	algorithm;code;coefficient;computer simulation;euclidean distance;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multipath propagation;noise power;principal component analysis;spatial multiplexing	Mingjun Gao;Yongzhao Li;Tao Li;Xiaofeng Lu;Hailin Zhang	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925908	mathematical optimization;computer science;mathematics;statistics	Vision	46.66199815566645	77.40331403801441	89782

Finger placement is typically performed using a path searcher, which estimates the power/delay profile (PDP) of the received signal to determine where signal energy is present. A commonly used finger placement approach is to place fingers at delays corresponding to the peaks of the PDP, with a restriction that fingers he no closer than some minimum spacing. Another approach is to place fingers on an equally-spaced grid of delays. For the typical urban (TU) channel model, we quantify performance of the two approaches in terms of acquired signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and modem bit- error-rate (BER). We show that performance depends primarily on minimum finger spacing and number of fingers. The grid approach performs well when there are enough fingers to collect most of the signal energy. For a channel model in which path delays vary dynamically, we find that the grid approach provides robust performance.	bit error rate;channel (communications);coefficient;decibel;modem;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;rake;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;x.690	Carmela Cozzo;Gregory E.

It is derived from [1] where it was originally developed for 4QAM transmission. The algorithm employs a minimum mean–squared error (MMSE) filter in each iteration in order to refine the data estimates. The rule for generating soft decisions is adapted continuously to the current state of the algorithm. It can be shown by simulations for a 16QAM transmission, that a linear finite length MMSE channel equalizer according to [2] is clearly outperformed. In addition to [1], we compare our new generalized scheme for different MMSE filter lengths and show the achievable extra gain.	algorithm;equalization (communications);iteration;simulation	Jürgen F.

In this architecture, a portion of the antennas at the BS is connected to low-power one-bit ADCs while the other is fed to power-hungry high-resolution ADCs. By taking into account the mixed-ADC architecture, we derive a closed-form expression for the sum spectral efficiency (SE) when maximum ratio combining (MRC) detection is employed at the BS. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to determine, for a given power budget at the BS, what is the optimal distribution of one-bit and high-resolution ADCs that maximizes the sum SE. Interestingly, it is shown that in most realistic scenarios, using only one-bit ADCs provides the best spectral efficiency for a given power budget constraint.	analog-to-digital converter;image resolution;low-power broadcasting;mimo;mathematical optimization;multi-user;optimization problem;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Hessam Pirzadeh;A.

Next, the data block size can be chosen to be large enough to minimize the CP overhead, yet small enough to make the channel variation over the block negligible. This paper considers the possibility of reducing the overall CP assistance, when transmitting sequences of SC blocks, while avoiding an excessively long fast Fourier transform window for FDE purposes and keeping good FDE performances through low-complexity, noniterative receiver techniques. These techniques, which take advantage of specially designed frame structures, rely on a basic algorithm for decision-directed correction (DDC) of the FDE inputs when the CP is not long enough to cope with the time-dispersive channel effects. More specifically, we present and evaluate a novel class of reduced-CP SC/FDE schemes, which takes advantage of a special frame structure for replacing """"useless"""" CP redundancy by fully useful channel coding redundancy, with the help of the DDC algorithm. When using the DDC-FDE technique with these especially designed frame structures, the impact of previous decisions, which are not error-free, is shown to be rather small, thereby allowing a power-efficiency advantage (in addition to the obvious bandwidth-efficiency advantage) over conventional block transmission implementations under full-length CP. Additionally, the DDC algorithm is also shown to be useful to improve the power efficiency of these conventional implementations"""	adobe framemaker;algorithm;block size (cryptography);channel capacity;dispersive partial differential equation;display data channel;fast fourier transform;forward error correction;multiplexing;overhead (computing);performance per watt;run-length encoding;transmitter	António Gusmão;Paulo Torres;Rui Dinis;Nelson L.

The principle behind the MWF is a whitening operation naturally created by a tri-diagonalization of the covariance matrix at each stage. In blind mode, tri-diagonalization of the implicit covariance matrix structure no longer occurs, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we show, using the CDMA system as an example, that tri-diagonalization can occur for blind mode using larger sample support or spatial diversity at the transmit or receive antenna.	decorrelation;multistage amplifier;triangular function;wiener filter	Seema Sud;Wilbur L.

In this paper we investigate the Levinson and Schur algorithm, as well as circulant embedding and circulant approximation methods applied to the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method and Frequency Domain Equalization (FDE). We develop a novel circulant approximation method which improves the performance/complexity tradeoff. We show that the optimal choice of algorithms largely depends on the antenna configuration.

Our objective is to recognize modulation schemes in highly-mobile communication environments, for military or high-speed railway applications, without signal knowledge or Channel State Information at the receiver. The proposed identification process is based on Blind Source Separation (BSS) and feature classification. We introduce a sliding window technique for the BSS of a faded-mixture to overcome the effect of the high mobility. Then, to improve the recognition of modulation schemes, we adopt a specific multi Artificial-Neural-Network (ANN) classifier, where each ANN is trained to be used within a particular Signal-to-Noise Ratio range. The proposed identifier has a good probability for achieving correct identifications under high velocity for typical carrier frequency and bandwidth.	artificial neural network;blind signal separation;carrier frequency;channel state information;identifier;mimo;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;source separation;statistical classification;velocity (software development)	Sofiane Kharbech;Iyad Dayoub;Marie Zwingelstein-Colin;Eric Pierre Simon;Kais Hassan	2014	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2014.2318041	speech recognition;telecommunications	Mobile	53.68497338859201	82.89151326060392	90793

By carefully locating data on odd subcarriers and clipping the resulting time signal, ACO-OFDM guarantees non-negative output amplitudes and clipping noise orthogonal to the information. However, in the conventional receiver, clipping noise is ignored in detection and data are extracted from odd subcarriers only. In this paper, a new receiver design for ACO-OFDM is proposed which exploits the structure of the clipping noise to improve the optical power efficiency. By observing the anti-symmetry of time domain samples, a simple pairwise maximum likelihood detector is developed and is used to fix half of the received samples to zero. Simulation results show that employing the proposed detector design leads to 1.3 dB optical gain at a BER of 10−5.	antisymmetry;bandlimiting;decibel;digital monetary trust;genie;mimo-ofdm;modulation;optical wireless;performance per watt;simulation;subcarrier;x.690	Kasra Asadzadeh;Awad Dabbo;Steve Hranilovic	2011	2011 IEEE GLOBECOM Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2011.6162559	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;electrical efficiency;telecommunications;time domain;computer science;intensity modulation;mathematics;optical performance monitoring	Robotics	48.28168797206804	81.02043578422193	90934

However, zero-IF receivers suffer from the effect of IQ imbalance and carrier frequency offset which may have huge impacts on their performance. Several joint compensation schemes for these influences have been researched, based on the correlation between adjacent channel frequency responses. However, by the limitation assuming the perfect symbol synchronization, these schemes show performance degradation when a symbol timing error exists. In this paper, we analyze the effect of symbol timing errors and propose a robust and efficient compensation scheme. Simulation results show the proposed algorithm achieves an SNR gain of 7.3 dB over the conventional algorithm when a symbol timing error occurs.	carrier frequency offset;decibel;elegant degradation;frequency response;genetic algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Jiho Kim;Yunho Jung;Byungjik Son;Jaeseok Kim	2007	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.4.524	wi-fi;electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;operating system	Mobile	49.37844415693867	79.60533000178263	90962

In the overloaded MIMO system the number of receive antenna elements is less than that of transmit antenna elements. It has been shown that under the overloaded condition the performance of joint detection deteriorates while diversity reduces the amount of performance degradation caused by signal multiplexing. Thus, this paper proposes a maximum likelihood joint decoding scheme of block coded signals in the overloaded MIMO-OFDM system. The performance of joint decoding over Rayleigh fading channels is evaluated through the experiments. It is shown that the diversity through block coding realizes a limited amount of performance degradation in joint decoding of 2 Hamming coded signal streams.	elegant degradation;experiment;frequency divider;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;rayleigh fading;window function	Tatsuro Yabe;Mamiko Inamori;Yukitoshi Sanada	2013	2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems	10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704618	electronic engineering;telecommunications;communication	Arch	44.55032802455745	76.24686014352291	90994

However, spline and low pass interpolator even they add higher complexity to the system, are more efficient to estimate the channel state information and gain SNR over the linear type.	channel state information;computer simulation;distortion;doppler effect;frequency response;linear interpolation;low-pass filter;modulation;multi-user;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;spline (mathematics);substructural type system	Samah A.

The decision feedback equalizer (DFE) is one of the preferred receivers for high ISI channels. The high data and symbol rate of current communications systems often require parallel processing receiver implementations [1]. Unfortunately, the complexity of parallel architectures of the DFE grows exponentially with the channel memory [2] and limits their application to low ISI channels. The DFFE avoids the exponential growth of the DFE by using tentative decisions to iteratively cancel the ISI. We show that the DFFE can achieve performance similar to the DFE. These benefits make it an excellent choice for high-speed receivers required to operate over highly dispersive channels.	ampersand;channel memory;coefficient;dispersive partial differential equation;equalization (communications);feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;information sciences institute;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;parallel computing;time complexity	Ariel L.

327fe3d63cb9d80fda2052a06dea4e76b2780993	error analysis of tas/mrc in rayleigh fading channel with non-gaussian noise		Abstract Transmit antenna selection with maximal ratio combining at the receiver (TAS/MRC) is a promising technique that can be used to avoid the hardware complexity of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system without jeopardizing the diversity gain. The generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) is used to model different kinds of additive noise including Gaussian, Laplacian, uniform, and impulsive. In this paper, we study the bit error performance of TAS/MRC system assuming flat Rayleigh fading channels perturbed by additive white generalized Gaussian noise (AWGGN). To this end, we provide a closed form expression for the average bit error rate of coherent modulation techniques in terms of Mejier’s G function that is readily available in many commercial mathematical software packages like MATLAB and Mathematica. Moreover, we study the asymptotic behavior of the BER at high signal to noise ratio (SNR). Analytical results are verified by simulation.	rayleigh fading;thermal-assisted switching	Amer M.

ca905cd4f45e4437ec2c43a792fc02596d0d034d	new measurement matrix for compressive sensing in cognitive radio networks		Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising solution for an efficient usage of both wideband and narrowband spectrum. Compressive sensing (CS) paradigm is one of the methods that can assist CR to sense the wideband sparse spectrum using a small number of measurements. The implementation of CS depends on utilising a suitable random or structured measurement matrix. To fully enhance CS performance, the measurement matrix should be a full rank and has a small mutual coherence with the basis matrix. According to these necessities, this study introduces a new measurement matrix called the modified regular parity check (RPC) matrix. RPC matrix that is first designed by Gallager technique suffers from the missing of the previous requirements. Thus, a new algorithm is proposed to convert this matrix to a semi-orthogonal one using the gradient-descent method with a variable step size. The modified RPC matrix has fixed values for all entries regardless of the number of active CR users relative to the maximum expected number of CR users. The results show that the proposed matrix has a low recovery error without increasing the recovery time compared with Gaussian matrix. Moreover, it achieves a higher probability of detection and smaller probability of false alarm.	cognitive radio;compressed sensing	Ahmed Ebian;Bassant Abdelhamid;Salwa H.

The results of a single cell multiuser investigation demonstrate increased traffic capacity. However, this increase is initially very moderate due to corruption of the channel estimates by interference from symbols not yet demodulated and cancelled. A modification in the transmitted signal structure addressing this problem is proposed. The results of a single cell analysis of the modified cancellation scheme demonstrate that the system's traffic capacity reaches approximately 80% of that of a multistage successive interference cancelling receiver operating with the perfect knowledge of channel parameters. A subsequent multicell investigation shows that for a hexagonal cell geometry with a path loss exponent of four and without any forward error correction (FEC) coding or cell sectorization, the system capacity compares very favorably with that of the IS-95 system, which employs powerful error control coding. Capacities with other path loss exponents and cell geometries are also investigated. The results show a substantial traffic capacity increase over that of a comparable receiver without interference cancellation.	interference (communication)	Anthony C. K. Soong;Witold A.

One of the most important advantages of massive MIMO is the capability of supporting a large number of users in the same time-frequency resource, which requires much larger dimensions of matrix inversion for ZF than conventional multi-user MIMO systems. In this case, Neumann Series (NS) has been considered for the Matrix Inversion Approximation (MIA), because of its suitability for massive MIMO systems and its advantages in hardware implementation. The performance-complexity trade-off and the hardware implementation of NS-based MIA in massive MIMO systems have been discussed. In this paper, we analyze the effects of the ratio of the number of massive MIMO antennas to the number of users on the performance of NS-based MIA. In addition, we derive the approximation error estimation formulas for different practical numbers of terms of NS-based MIA. These results could offer useful guidelines for practical massive MIMO systems.	approximation error;error analysis (mathematics);error detection and correction;error floor;multi-user mimo;the matrix;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Dengkui Zhu;Boyu Li;Ping Liang	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248580	mathematical optimization;3g mimo;multi-user mimo;control theory;mathematics;spatial multiplexing	Embedded	51.26225794481618	81.06838317010113	91980

Cooperative communication has been widely investigated to improve the performance of wireless communication. Unfortunately, most existing cooperative schemes have the common fault of decreased transmission rate because the destination should receive the decodable compositions of symbols from the source and the relay. In this letter, we propose a new cooperative model that uses spatial phase coding (SPC) for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). This technique is free from the rate-loss and allows seamless cooperative communication while its diversity gain matches that of the conventional multiple antenna technique. The proposed technique is evaluated in terms of bit error rate (BER) and simulation results show that the proposed cooperative scheme approaches the performance of conventional multiple antenna system when the link between users is guaranteed. key words: SPC, OFDMA, cooperative communication		Ki-Ro Kim;Seung-Jun Yu;Hyoung-Kyu Song	2014	IEICE Transactions	10.1587/transinf.E97.D.1897	statistical process control;statistics	Mobile	43.70414461707016	81.65411020859408	92216

The NBI suppression is carried out in the analog domain (before the digital processing) via a feedforward structure. The suitability of this NBI suppression concept is confirmed by the performance evaluation in the presence of strong NBI. We consider both an unmodulated single-tone interference and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) interference from an IEEE 802.11a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). As a comparison, we also investigate the use of a Hard Limiter (HLM). To ensure an effective NBI mitigation, we discuss the threshold selection of the SLM/HLM in the case of full-resolution as well as b-bit receivers (1 ≤ b ≤ 4). When b ≠ 1, a joint adjustment of both the threshold and the Automatic Gain Control (AGC) is required. In the presence of the strong OFDM interference, a block-based threshold adaptive NBI suppression technique is proposed. Moreover, we also evaluate the frequency-dependent performance of the proposed receiver.	automatic gain control;coherence (physics);digital data;feedforward neural network;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;itil;interference (communication);limiter;modulation;multiplexing;performance evaluation;spatial light modulator;ultra-wideband;zero suppression	Nuan Song;Mike Wolf;Martin Haardt	2010	2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems	10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624384	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science	Arch	47.718497587000726	81.75442814830846	92225
5f6a69b71dc3a9f1f683a484cd7390b25a93f8e2	multiuser millimeter wave beamforming strategies with quantized and statistical csit		To alleviate the high cost of hardware in mm-wave systems, hybrid analog/digital precoding is typically employed. In the conventional two-stage feedback scheme, the analog beamformer is determined by beam search and feedback to maximize the desired signal power of each user. The digital precoder is designed based on quantization and feedback of effective channel to mitigate multiuser interference. Alternatively, we propose a one-stage feedback scheme, which effectively reduces the complexity of the signalling and feedback procedure. Specifically, the second-order channel statistics are leveraged to design digital precoder for interference mitigation while all feedback overhead is reserved for precise analog beamforming. Under a fixed total feedback constraint, we investigate the conditions under which the one-stage feedback scheme outperforms the conventional two-stage counterpart. Moreover, a rate splitting (RS) transmission strategy is introduced to further tackle the multiuser interference and enhance the rate performance. Consider: 1) RS precoded by the one-stage feedback scheme and 2) conventional transmission strategy precoded by the two-stage scheme with the same first-stage feedback as 1) and also certain amount of extra second-stage feedback. We show that 1) can achieve a sum rate comparable to that of 2). Hence, RS enables remarkable saving in the second-stage training and feedback overhead.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;beam search;beamforming;binary logarithm;codebook;exptime;euler;hp 48 series;interference (communication);inverse kinematics;jensen's inequality;linux/rk;maxima and minima;multi-user;overhead (computing);personal message;quantization (signal processing);radio frequency;reed–solomon error correction;signal-to-noise ratio;simplified instructional computer;social inequality;sparse matrix;transceiver;transmitter;turing completeness	Mingbo Dai;Bruno Clerckx	2017	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2017.2737009	telecommunications;control theory	Mobile	42.154331777497745	86.67899501838887	92241
922ea9b1aa462c97fedf2f0e5f31e91517275a06	performance of enhanced massive multiuser mimo systems using transmit beamforming and transmit antenna selection techniques		In this paper, the performances of massive multiuser multiple input multiple output (MMU MIMO) system with different transmit beamforming (BF) techniques and different suboptimal transmit antenna selection (TAS) algorithms over Rayleigh fading channels are investigated. Three linear transmit BF types are considered, namely, maximum ratio transmission (MRT BF), zero forcing (ZF BF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE BF). Two TAS algorithms are considered, that are pairwise error probability minimization (PM) and the capacity maximization (CM). TAS techniques are used in order to reduce the number of radio frequency (RF) chains, system complexity, and cost. This makes MMU MIMO more applicable in beyond 4G communication systems. The simulation results show that TAS algorithms are capable of decreasing the complexity of the system while maintaining the same performance of the MMU MIMO system, complex TAS techniques are not needed at large number of RF chains, and the performance improvement due to the increase of this number is limited to a certain threshold. It also demonstrated that the MMSE BF and ZF BF bit error rate performance values are better than MRT BF values for both CM and PM TAS algorithms, but it is limited to the large number of users. On the other hand, the MRT BF technique performance is good at small Eb/N0 values for both PM and CM TAS but it is relatively less affected by increasing the number of users.	beamforming;bit error rate;brainfuck;eb/n0;expectation–maximization algorithm;mimo-ofdm;markov chain;mean squared error;memory management unit;multi-user mimo;pairwise error probability;performance;radio frequency;rayleigh fading;scheduling (computing);selection algorithm;simulation;thermal-assisted switching;transmitter;x.690;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Said Esmail El-Khamy;Karim H.

Therefore, traditional Impulse radio receivers demand non-practical implementation structures. In this paper we propose a novel correlation-adaptive receiver structure with low complexity for indoor high speed ultra wide band systems. This novel structure combines correlation characteristics from Rake receivers with recursive filters from adaptive receivers. The receiver includes a low complexity recursive channel estimation filter capable of estimating hundreds of channel impulse responses, and a single filter-correlation filter used for coherent bit demodulation. Furthermore, we derive by simulations the bit error rate for high density multipath environments for several impulse radio modulations like TH-PPM, DS-BPSK and TH-BPSK and we compare the performance of the proposed structure with typical Rake receivers.	algorithm;bit error rate;catastrophic interference;central processing unit;channel state information;coherence (physics);digital signal processor;interference (communication);jumbo frame;multipath propagation;rake;recursion;recursive filter;shift register;simulation;ultra-wideband	Leonardo Betancur Agudelo;Andrés Navarro Cadavid	2009	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2009.091004	telecommunications;computer science;ultra-wideband	Networks	45.806052562042105	76.037301398042	92348

The developed algorithms are based on the maximum log-likelihood functions, which are derived from received signals. First of all, we derived the amplitude PDF of M-ary QAM signal over flat and slowly Rayleigh and Rician fading channel, then we developed the log-likelihood functions and then the decision functions for classification. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed classifier, we give an example to classify the 16/32 QAM signals. Results indicate that the performance of classifier is heavily dependent on the severity of channel fading. When channel is AWGN, which means that there exists only one path (may be specular path) between transmitter and receiver, and the Rician factor k, approaches infinity in this case, henceforth, the performance is the best. The performance, however, is degraded with the decrease of k, and finally the classifier performs worst when channel becomes Rayleigh. Further performance improvement can be achieved by increasing the length of record.

Just like the terminal complexity and consumption, the performance of the terminal depends narrowly on the number of Rake fingers. Removing the channel estimation bias can considerably improve the Rake receiver performance when the paths are spaced by less than a one chip period. The study shows that, in the presence of path correlation, the perfect channel estimation does not give necessarily the best performance.	channel state information;rake	Thierry Clessienne;Sheng Yang	2004	2004 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (IEEE Cat.

ca0d1f8aa2a6249cccf86e95edba4fb49edf6bf9	a virtual pilot-assisted channel estimation algorithm for mimo-scfde systems over fast time-varying multipath channels		This paper considers a novel virtual pilot-assisted channel estimation algorithm for multiple input multiple output single carrier frequency domain equalization (MIMO-SCFDE) systems over fast time-varying multipath channels. Given that the fast time-varying channels can no longer support the assumption that the channel frequency-domain response remains invariant for the duration of one SC-FDE symbol, most of the channel estimation methods cannot be directly applied to MIMO-SCFDE systems. We put forward an iterative interfrequency interference cancellation method for the time-varying multipath channels over one SC-FDE symbol. The proposed method utilizes the virtual pilot-assisted channel estimation and partial minimum-mean-square-error equalization to improve the accuracy of the estimation. Simulation results validate the improved performance of the proposed method for MIMO-SCFDE systems over fast time-varying multipath channels.	adobe framemaker;algorithm;carrier frequency;channel state information;interference (communication);iterative method;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;multipath propagation;simulation	Zedong Xie;Xihong Chen;Xiaopeng Liu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2810081	interpolation;single antenna interference cancellation;mimo;frequency domain;electronic engineering;multipath propagation;equalization (audio);computer science;algorithm;interference (wave propagation);communication channel	Visualization	49.502810403224835	79.42985224447902	92740

Three microdiversity techniques, equal gain combining (EGC), maximal ratio combining (MRC) and selection combining (SC) are compared. The system performances are assessed by considering two measures of coverage; one well suited for mobile users and one well suited for portable users. The detrimental effects of multipath fading in cellular mobile radio systems can be mitigated by using a number of microdiversity paths at the receiver. The effects of shadowing can be mitigated by using a number K of macrodiversity radio ports to serve each cell. The improvements gained by using microdiversity to combat multipath fading and macrodiversity to combat shadowing are investigated. The effects of the fading severity, the number of microdiversity branches at each port L and the number of macrodiversity ports K on the system performance are investigated in detail. The results, in most cases, are obtained by carrying out a single numerical integration (for any order of diversity). The results show that although MRC gives the best performance, EGC and SC perform nearly as well for dual (L=2) diversity. For larger L, i.e., L/spl ges/4, the relative performance of SC deteriorates substantially whereas the performance of EGC remains close to that of MRC. Also, our results show that as the fading gets less severe, the performance of EGC gets closer to that of MRC, while the performance of SC worsens compared to that of MRC. >		Adnan A.

In recent papers classical and Bayesian linear data estimators as well as the non-linear sphere decoding (SD) approach have been investigated in the UW-OFDM context. In general, the remaining error samples after a linear data estimation in UW-OFDM are correlated. In this work, noise interpolation (NI) is proposed, which uses preliminary data decisions together with Wiener interpolation to exploit these correlations. It turns out that the selection of samples to be used for NI is crucial. With the sample selection policy suggested in this work, NI clearly outperforms LMMSE data estimation, and due to its lower complexity compared to SD, it can be regarded as an attractive compromise for UW-OFDM reception.	bit error rate;cyclic redundancy check;frequency divider;interpolation;kernel density estimation;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;nonlinear system;simulation;whitening transformation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Alexander Onic;Mario Huemer	2014	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2014.2317512	stochastic process;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;interpolation;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics	ML	49.28729726285988	76.2659008741678	92959

We find the MIMO Fisher information matrix (FIM) and consider its properties, including the maximum rank of the unconstrained FIM, and develop necessary conditions for the FIM to achieve full rank. Equality constraints provide a means to study the potential value of side information, such as training (semi-blind case), constant modulus (CM) sources, or source non-Gaussianity. Non-redundant constraints may be combined in an arbitrary fashion, so that side information may be different for different sources. The bounds are useful for evaluating various MIMO source and channel estimation algorithms. We present an example using the constant modulus blind equalization algorithm.	channel state information;mimo	Brian M. Sadler;Richard J. Kozick;Terrence J.

An exact union bound formed by this formula, together with the asymptotic union bound, are studied for optimization and bit-error rate (BER) evaluation of space-time (S-T) codes. Numerical calculations and Monte Carlo computer simulation have been used to study these two union bounds on a 2-by-2 MIMO system using a rotation-based diagonal S-T code (D code) in a block fading channel.

Based on simulation results, the proposed scheme demonstrates superior performance compared to the conventional scheme as the number of iteration increases.	iteration;mimo;mutual information;simulation	Sangheon Kim;Myeongcheol Shin;Chungyong Lee	2007	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2007.906230	filter;detector;quadrature amplitude modulation;convergence;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;feedback;mathematics;statistics;mimo	Mobile	46.63025560468396	75.9012541068041	93455

On the contrary, we present an analysis based on the discrete model of the multicarrier signal. It is shown that the discrete model provides more accurate signal-to-distortion ratio and out-of-band spectrum prediction if the number of subcarriers is small. Only the effect of third-order nonlinearity is studied; however results can also be extended to the fifth-order polynomial model.

In the recent literature there are several comprehensive studies that analyze its performance results and main implementation issues. Nevertheless, there has not yet been addressed its possible impact on the transmitter Peak to Average Ratio (PAPR). The main objective of this paper is to fill that gap and study the PAPR behavior of LDM signals. Therefore, first of all a theoretical study is presented, and afterwards, the obtained conclusions are compared with several practical simulations. What is more, the instantaneous power fluctuations of the multi-layered signals are compared with the single layer (SL) OFDM physical waveform. Finally, several PAPR reduction techniques are briefly presented, and the TR (Tone Reservation) method is applied to an LDM signal.	atsc 3.0;baseline (configuration management);multiplexing;power architecture platform reference;radio frequency;sl (complexity);simulation;terrestrial television;transmitter;waveform	Jon Montalban;Jon Barrueco;Itziar Angulo;Liang Zhang;Yiyan Wu;Wei Li;Heung Mook Kim;Sung Ik Park;Jae-young Lee	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting	10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177279	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Arch	44.248388512836314	82.39254322871501	93646

The pointing errors are widely considered as a combination of two components: boresight and jitter. A statistical model is investigated for pointing errors with nonzero boresight by taking into account the laser beamwidth, detector aperture size, and jitter variance. A novel closed-form probability density function (PDF) is derived for this new nonzero boresight pointing error model. Furthermore, we obtain closed-form PDF for the composite lognormal turbulence channels and finite series approximate PDF for the composite Gamma-Gamma turbulence channels, which is suitable for terrestrial FSO applications impaired by building sway. We conduct error rate analysis of on-off keying signaling with intensity modulation and direct detection over the lognormal and Gamma-Gamma fading channels. Asymptotic error rate analysis and outage probability of such a system are also presented based on the derived composite PDFs. It is shown that the boresight can only affect the coding gain, while the diversity order is determined by the atmospheric fading effect as well as the pointing error effect.	approximation algorithm;coding gain;downtime;key (cryptography);modulation;on-off keying;portable document format;statistical model;terrestrial television;turbulence	Fan Yang;Julian Cheng;Theodoros A.

9202e02243040f2d6442a112a5e6ecf5a1f29d7c	compact antenna spacing in mmwave mimo systems using random phase precoding		Presence of strong line of sight (LOS) components in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating at mmWave frequencies result in ill-conditioned channel matrices. However, optimum inter-antenna spacing can result in orthogonal channel matrices under LOS conditions. This optimal spacing is typically large (of the order of tens of wavelengths). Antennas separated by less than optimal spacing result in degraded performance due to high spatial correlation. This motivates the need to investigate techniques that can reduce the spacing without compromising much in performance. In this work, we propose random phase precoding (RPP) as an attractive method to achieve this objective. Our contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, RPP for reducing inter-antenna spacing in mmWave communications is novel and has not been reported before. Our results show that, using RPP, the inter-antenna spacing can be reduced to the order of wavelength (5mm at 60 GHz frequency) compared to optimal spacing which is of the order of tens of wavelengths. This is achieved without the need for channel state information at the transmitter. We also present an analysis that shows that RPP reduces the effective correlation which, in turn, aids compact spacing. Second, we study an index modulation scheme where the random phase precoder matrices are indexed to convey additional information bits. The indexed RPP scheme is found to perform better than the non-indexed RPP scheme.	channel state information;condition number;indexed grammar;mimo;modulation;transmitter	G. D.

41c1fc2b0f0cb5cdd5cba6e054a9ae9def3402af	performance analysis of a novel antenna array calibration approach for direction finding systems		This paper addresses the problem of the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation in the presence of an uncalibrated array, i.e., when phase offset, carrier frequency offset, and phase noise occur among the array signals. The method that we propose consists in the use of a particular antenna array which comprises the elements for the DoA estimation and a common antenna which is shared with a splitter among the receivers. The signal that impinges on the common antenna is acquired by every receiver and allows the estimation of the phase ambiguity. After the calibration step is performed, analog switches select the array elements for the DoA estimation. A method which enables the phase ambiguity estimation is presented, and several simulated performance results are illustrated. Furthermore, we show the effect on calibration due to the presence of different carrier frequency offsets among the receivers, and we propose an approach for their compensation. The presence of phase noise is also considered, and its effect is analyzed.

In this paper, an efficient CCI cancellation method is proposed that may be utilized for an improved coexistence. The method treats both co-channel signals as desired signals and enhances them in an iterative manner. Through computer simulations, it is demonstrated that it yields significant gains in the symbol error rate (SER) performance of both the NB and multicarrier systems. Its computational complexity is compared with the complexity of the joint demodulation technique and it is shown to be much lower.	catastrophic interference;coexist (image);computational complexity theory;computer simulation;interference (communication);iterative method;naive bayes classifier;next-generation network	Mustafa E.

The threshold is calculated by the second-order statistics of the signal magnitude spectrum combined with the first-order statistics. The new algorithm is more constringent with the iteration.

After modelling MC-CDMA as a sphere packing lattice, a low-complexity maximum-likelihood (ML) detection, sphere decoding algorithm, is applied to jointly detect all users. The impacts of channel estimation errors are studied by incorporating a semi-blind subspace based channel estimation in the receiver. The selection of search radius and the complexity of the receiver are also investigated. Another promising detection technique, genetic algorithm (GA) based multiuser detector (MLJD) is also studied.

Chip equalization can restore the orthogonality and suppress the MUI. In the context of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) DS-CDMA systems, spatial multiplexing emits independant data streams from the MT transmit antennas which allows to significantly enhance the spectral efficiency. However, combined with DS-CDMA, spatial multiplexing also leads to an MT -fold increase of the MUI. Linear chip equalization only is not able to cope with the induced MUI. In this paper, we therefore propose a new combined linear and non-linear multi-user receiver for the Spatially Multiplexed DS-CDMA (SM DS-CDMA) downlink. The proposed receiver consists of an initial linear chip equalization stage and possibly multiple non-linear Parallel Interference Cancellation (PIC) stages with RAKE combining. With a single PIC/RAKE stage, it achieves a 5, 1 dB gain given a BER of 10, compared to the linear MMSE receiver only. A second PIC/RAKE stage brings an additional 0, 9 dB gain at the expense of increased complexity.	decibel;interference (communication);mimo;magic user interface;multi-user;multipath propagation;nonlinear system;rake;soft-in soft-out decoder;software propagation;spatial multiplexing;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;x.690	Frederik Petré;Damien Barbera;Luc Deneire;Marc Moonen	2002		10.1109/PIMRC.2002.1045201	chip;multipath propagation;code division multiple access;single antenna interference cancellation;telecommunications;computer science;space time;radio receiver;spread spectrum;spatial multiplexing;multiplexing;spectral efficiency;computer network	ML	45.48105239581882	77.7517607762344	94824

We show that with a single receive antenna a receiver is capable of detecting and cancelling a single in-band interferer using the same modulation and coding scheme as the desired signal. We investigate the benefits of using such an interference canceller at the mobile unit in the downlink scenario of wireless cellular networks. Significant improvements in terms of the average system throughput and outage probability are achieved with iterative interference cancellation. The effectiveness of the interference canceller allows us to consider more aggressive frequency reuse schemes, such as using smaller cluster sizes, and using three-sectored cells where all sectors share the same frequency band.	downtime;frequency band;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;modulation;multi-user;relay;sensor;telecommunications link;throughput;zero suppression	Ahmed Mohamed Abdelsalam Ahmed;Ian D.

OFDM is a promising solution achieving high data rates in a mobile environment. In wireless communication systems, signal distortion and attenuation in transmission caused by multipath effects makes it necessary to obtain knowledge related to the channel impulse response using channel estimation to provide compensation.This study combined a back propagation neural network for the estimation of channel and compensation signals with a genetic algorithm to improve performance and the convergence rate. We compared bit error rates and the mean square error of the proposed neural network with that of the conventional neural network, the least square (LS) algorithm, and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithm in existing OFDM channel environments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the LS algorithm and is on par with the MMSE algorithm. Communicated by V. Loia.

402920e880835a3dfeb299b3deb9948ad966c8f9	closed-form approximations for coverage probability of multistream mimo-zfbf receivers in hetnets		The evaluation of the coverage probability of multistream multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications in HetNets subject to noise, fading, and intercell interference is undoubtedly intricate. Unfortunately, the current literature misses its comprehensive evaluation, as the effects of noise and cross-stream correlation are often overlooked. Furthermore, computationally friendly expressions of the coverage probability allowing engineering insights and adaptive system design are lacking. For multistream MIMO zero-forcing beamforming, in this paper we tackle these issues by considering scenarios where a receiver is in the coverage if all of its data-streams are successfully decoded. Assuming the max signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) cell association (CA), we adopt the stochastic geometry tools to provide an upper bound and an easy-to-compute closed-form lower bound on the coverage probability, while their accuracies are confirmed against extensive simulations. Our contributions are as follows. We prove that full correlation of data streams of a given link slightly reduces the coverage performance. We show that from a coverage probability perspective, the single stream communication is preferable. We exploit our analysis to explore several pertinent design issues, which have not fully discussed in the literature. Our results demonstrate tradeoffs between densification and multiplexing gains. We, further, see that by appropriately designating feedback channel with modest capacity 8 bits per frame per user, the spatial throughput grows by nearly 180 $\%$ over the conventional 1-bit feedback scenario. Finally, We present important extensions of our analysis to underlay spectrum sharing, practical aspects of the max-SINR CA, and a nonhomogeneous path loss environment.	1-bit architecture;adaptive system;approximation;beamforming;interference (communication);mimo;multiplexing;norm (social);relevance;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;systems design;throughput	Mohammad G.

Additionally large scale antenna arrays with high gain adaptive beamforming are viewed as critical for overcoming the poor path loss conditions in the mmWave bands. User-specific beamforming can solve the coverage problem for user-specific data and control traffic, but the coverage problem for transmitting broadcast control information must also be solved. This paper explores the problem of enhancing the performance of a broadcast control channel, where control information must be transmitted to the entire sector in a non-user specific or multicast fashion. We propose a technique for transmitting broadcast control information in a mmWave system with RF beamforming that offers improved performance and several key advantages over a grid-of-beams type of approach where control information is simply repeated in time across successive narrow RF beams.	bch code;basis function;beamforming;mimo;multicast;phase noise;radio frequency;simulation;transmitter	Timothy A.

Space-time coding using multiple transmit antennas is an effective countermeasure for fading. For terminals which have only one antenna, due to the size/cost limitations, user cooperation has been introduced as a diversity technique. In this paper, a space-time coded cooperative relaying scheme for a multihop communications scenario, in cases where the number of hops is more than two, is proposed in order to combat the effects of fading among single antenna terminals, without bandwidth expansion. The scheme utilizes a space-time code for cooperative relaying and is developed in both frequency-flat and frequency-selective fading channels. By computer simulations, it is shown that the proposed scheme provides diversity gain and more improvement of frame error rate as the number of hops increases. Furthermore, the effects of an error correcting code and co-channel interference are shown.	bandwidth expansion;computer simulation;forward error correction;interference (communication);multi-user mimo;relay;routing	Tsuyoshi Miyano;Hidekazu Murata;Kiyomichi Araki	2004	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2004.

In general, 4 time s oversampling is enough for estimating continuous signal. B ut, we can use 2 times oversampling with similar bit error rate (BER) performance. Therefore, we can reduce the computatio nal complexity half roughly. Simulation results show that BER performance when 2 times oversampling is used is almost the same as 4 times oversampling is used. On the other hand, BER performance when 1 times ovesampling (Nyquist rate) is used is degraded than 2 times oversampling or 4 times oversampling a re used.

One of these particular RF challenges is the phase noise (PN) created by the local oscillators (LOs) which is made worse by upbanding (i.e., multiplication by some factor) the LO to reach the desired frequency. The result of this relatively large PN is that in block-processing systems such as frequency-domain equalization for single carrier, there will be an unknown phase value which changes from block to block. Thus even if the channel itself does not change from one block to another, there would be one unknown phase value which needs to be tracked. In this paper we explore existing and propose new blind methods for tracking the PN in a null cyclic prefix single-carrier communication system. The methods are designed for BPSK and QAM constellations and are seen in simulations to have better performance than pilot-assisted tracking.	bose wave system;local oscillator;phase noise;radio frequency;simulation	Timothy A.

This scheeme has a high potential to considerably improve the performance of cooperative OFDM systems. However, in practice, the implementation of this technique may suffer from multiple problems caused by the separation of the subcarriers from each other's. In this Contribution, we propose a new selection scheme denoted “Optimized Selective OFDMA” that approaches selective OFDMA performance in terms of outage probability while reducing its synchronization problems that may be caused by the subcarriers separation. The outage probability and diversity order of the proposed scheme are derived. The number of the used paths is also analyzed. We proved that for high SNR, the introduced scheme gives exactly the same performance of selective OFDMA with only one path for all the subcarriers.	code;cooperative mimo;downtime;signal-to-noise ratio;subcarrier;sun outage;whole earth 'lectronic link	Ala Gouissem;Mazen O.

In addition, the wideband characteristics of multi-carrier signals result in frequency-dependent distortions, typically known as memory effects. This study aims to analytically evaluate the impact of the distortion induced by non-linear HPA with memory on a multi-carrier signal exemplified by orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The behavioural model of HPA considered for theoretical analysis is a memory polynomial model, which is a truncated form of the Volterra series. In the theoretical framework developed, this study shows that memory in HPA considerably degrades the performance of OFDM in terms of symbol error rate (SER), and the distortion itself can be canonically characterised by a complex attenuation component and a non-linear noise component. Closed-form expressions for SER in additive white Gaussian noise channel are derived and the SER for fading channel is approximated by the adaptive Gauss-Kronrod quadrature method. Simulation results are shown for a realistic HPA, based on the Wiener-Hammerstein model, and compared with the analytical results to validate the proposed analysis.	audio power amplifier;frequency divider;multiplexing;nonlinear system	Vivek Ashok Bohara;See Ho Ting	2009	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2008.0740	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics	HPC	42.57163492390146	77.40200008891567	95714

Such knowledge is usually obtained via a training sequence. However in vehicular networks, the channel coherence time is very small due to the high speeds of the nodes, therefore the channel estimate from the training is likely to become inaccurate as the decoding proceeds. Using shorter packets can improve the performance at the cost of increased overhead. In this paper we introduce a novel channel tracking algorithm for VBLAST in vehicular networks with relatively little change in the overhead. The algorithm uses first order Kalman filters therefore it has less complexity than available tracking algorithms. The algorithm uses the detected symbols and received signal after the interference cancellation and detection processes of the VBLAST decoder to improve the channel estimation. Simulation results show considerable improvement in mean square error (MSE) and BER when using this algorithm compared to channel estimation by training only with small increase in hardware complexity.	algorithm;channel state information;interference (communication);kalman filter;mean squared error;overhead (computing);simulation;x.690	Ghassan M.

Apart from the huge spectral efficiency gain, 3-D massive-MIMO/FD-MIMO systems can also lead to significant reduction of latency, simplified multiple access layer, and robustness to interference. However, in order to completely extract the benefits of the system, accurate channel state information is critical. In this paper, a channel estimation method based on direction of arrival (DoA) estimation is presented for 3-D millimeter wave massive-MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. To be specific, the DoA is estimated using estimation of signal parameter via rotational invariance technique method, and the root mean square error of the DoA estimation is analytically characterized for the corresponding MIMO-OFDM system. An ergodic capacity analysis of the system in the presence of DoA estimation error is also conducted, and an optimum power allocation algorithm is derived. Furthermore, it is shown that the DoA-based channel estimation achieves a better performance than the traditional linear minimum mean squared error estimation in terms of ergodic throughput and minimum chordal distance between the subspaces of the downlink precoders obtained from the underlying channel and the estimated channel.	algorithm;channel state information;direction of arrival;ergodicity;frequency divider;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput	Rubayet Shafin;Lingjia Liu;Jianzhong Zhang;Yik-Chung Wu	2016	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2016.2594173	estimation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;mathematics;statistics;mimo	Metrics	43.41093830307195	85.05617828367178	95878

0da8ef109dad4abbfec55cd10bca7f9b4cc41d62	a low-complexity air interface with transmit diversity for low power wide area networks		We present the design of a low-complexity air interface for the uplink in Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) based on a recently published Differential Spatial Modulation scheme for two transmit antennas achieving full transmit diversity (FD-DSM). Extending the authors' work, we derive an optimized assignment from bits to space-time matrices comparable to Gray coding, which improves the bit error rate by up to 1 dB. Furthermore, FD-DSM's superiority over single-antenna differential PSK schemes as used in current LPWAN technologies is evaluated in extensive simulations and confirmed in uncoded and coded scenarios, where a convolutional code with soft-input Viterbi decoding is employed. It is shown that existing systems are outperformed by at least 5 dB for packet error rates below 1%. Our system utilizes the DSSS technique to achieve the enormous processing gains required to enable links over many kilometers. We propose the insertion of time gaps between chip sequences to allow for the rise and fall time of conventional, spectrally-efficient pulse shaping filters and to thus facilitate antenna switching without spectral broadening, a challenging issue in Spatial Modulation (SM) systems. The resulting rate loss is negligible but allows the realization of practical SM systems with the theoretical minimum of a single RF chain.	bit error rate;convolutional code;decibel;fall time;modulation;network packet;noise shaping;phy (chip);pre-shared key;pulse shaping;radio frequency;simulation;software propagation;spectral efficiency;systems design;telecommunications link;testbed;viterbi decoder;x.690	Felix Wunsch;Holger Jaekel;Friedrich Jondral	2018	2018 IEEE 87th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2018.8417641	viterbi decoder;electronic engineering;convolutional code;computer science;chip;transmit diversity;bit error rate;direct-sequence spread spectrum;network packet;gray code	Mobile	44.82851114985539	81.7071069602408	95967

However, the MSSNR method tends to design a TEQ with a bandpass-like frequency response, resulting in a spectrally uneven effective channel response. As as result, bitloading have to be performed to improve the bit rate of the system. Additionally, when residual intersymbol interference (ISI) is low compared to noise power, the spectral shape of the effective channel does not have much impact on the bit rate. However, the negative effect of the channel spectral unevenness on achievable bit rate increases as the noise power decreases. In this paper, a design method is proposed to maximize effective channel spectral flatness to increase the bit rate of the system.	algorithmic efficiency;equalization (communications);frequency response;information sciences institute;interference (communication);noise power;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral flatness	Ian Y.

3a8ca96beb03ce1a1a3fee1037cf22ffec73dac5	a compressed sensing technique for ofdm channel estimation using full-band training symbols		Based on compressed-sensing (CS) technique, a channel estimation scheme OFDM system for double-selected channel is proposed in this work. The variation of each channel path is fitted using a polynomial instead of the Doppler spread model, where a more flexible assumption is allowed, and the sparsity required for the CS technique is still available since each can be characterized using few parameters. In order to mitigate the inter-carrier interference (ICI) and observe the channel state information (CSI) more precisely, full-band training symbols are introduced instead of pilot tones. Combining the full-band training symbols and the polynomial fitting, a determinate measurement matrix is derived for the proposed CS channel estimation constructed using the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), and a more accurate channel estimation results can be provided comparing to that based on the conventional least-square (LS) algorithm. The case of multiple transmission antennas is also evaluated, and the improvement can be more significant.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;channel state information;compressed sensing;ici (programming language);interference (communication);least squares;matching pursuit;openmp;polynomial;property (philosophy);sparse matrix	Huang-Chang Lee;Pin-Yuan Chen;Cihun-Siyong Alex Gong	2017	2017 Ninth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)	10.1109/ICUFN.2017.7993851	channel state information;compressed sensing;matching pursuit;computer science;distributed computing;speech recognition;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;algorithm;polynomial;interference (wave propagation);matrix (mathematics);communication channel	Mobile	50.08540535768261	80.11232732691845	96127

Both single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) and multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) modes are supported. With UL-MIMO, multiple layers of data are mapped on the same set of recourses and transmitted simultaneously. Accordingly, the demodulation reference signal (DMRS) in LTE-A applies both frequency domain code division multiplexing and time domain code division multiplexing to support channel estimation for each multiplexed layer. Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based channel estimation schemes and the applications for LTE UL-MIMO have been widely studied. However, the orthogonality among DMRS of different layers could be reduced due to the channel conditions. The effect is significant when the arrival times of the paired user equipment (UE) at the receiver are not strictly aligned if MU-MIMO is applied. Consequently, the performance of DFT-based channel estimation schemes is affected. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel DFT based channel estimation scheme that can restore the inter-layer orthogonality. Simulation results show that the proposed method provides significant improvement over conventional DFT-based channel estimation methods.	channel state information;committed information rate;compaq lte;discrete fourier transform;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;reduction (complexity);sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;spectral leakage;telecommunications link;throughput	Qiang Li;Yu-chun Wu;Shulan Feng;Philipp Zhang;Lixia Xue;Yongxing Zhou	2014	2014 IEEE 79th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2014.7023010	electronic engineering;real-time computing;multi-user mimo;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications link;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;frequency domain;mimo	Mobile	48.326998019130464	81.32413775653959	96152

Most existing estimation techniques are designed for CDMA systems with short repetitive spreading codes. However, current and next-generation wireless systems use long spreading codes whose periods are much larger than the symbol duration. In this paper, we derive the maximum-likelihood channel estimate for long-code CDMA systems over multipath channels using training sequences and approximate it using an iterative algorithm to reduce the computational complexity in each symbol duration. The iterative channel estimate is also shown to be asymptotically unbiased. The effectiveness of the iterative channel estimator is demonstrated in terms of squared error in estimation as well as the bit error rate performance of a multistage detector based on the channel estimates. The effect of error in decision feedback from the multistage detector (used in the absence of training sequences) is also shown to be negligible for reasonable feedback error rates using simulations. The proposed iterative channel estimation technique is also extended to track slowly varying multipath fading channels using decision feedback. Thus, an MAI-resistant multiuser channel estimation and tracking scheme with reasonable computational complexity is derived for long-code CDMA systems over multipath fading channels.	approximation algorithm;bit error rate;channel state information;code;computational complexity theory;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;multi-user;multipath propagation;multistage amplifier;simulation	Srikrishna Bhashyam;Behnaam Aazhang	2002	IEEE Trans.

However, the constantly increasing demand for broadband and interactive satellite links emanates the need to apply novel interference mitigation techniques, striving towards Terabit throughput. In this direction, the objective of the present contribution is to investigate joint multiuser processing techniques for multibeam satellite systems. In the forward link, the performance of linear precoding is investigated with optimal nonlinear precoding (i.e., dirty article coding) acting as the upper performance limit. To this end, the resulting power and precoder design problems are approached through optimization methods. Similarly, in the return link the concept of linear filtering (i.e., linear minimum mean square error) is studied with the optimal successive interference cancelation acting as the performance limit. The derived capacity curves for both scenarios are compared to conventional satellite systems where beams are processed independently and interbeam interference is mitigated through a four color frequency reuse scheme, in order to quantify the potential gain of the proposed techniques.	adaptive coding;communications satellite;dvb-s2;digital video broadcasting;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;mean squared error;modulation;multi-user;nonlinear system;return channel;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;terabit;throughput	Dimitrios Christopoulos;Symeon Chatzinotas;Gan Zheng;Joel Grotz;Björn E.

If the correlations change, the detectors must be redesigned. An ideal computation of the decorrelating or the linear minimum mean-squared-error (LMMSE) detector requires order K/sup 3/ flops, where K is the number of users. To alleviate the computational complexity, iterative decorrelating and LMMSE detectors are proposed. The iterative detectors use steepest descent (SD), conjugate gradient (CG), and preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithms, and require order K/sup 2/ flops per iteration. Their main advantages are the reduced number of flops and their suitability to highly parallel implementations. The correlation coefficient computation can also be embedded into the CG algorithm, which is an advantage with time-varying signature waveforms. The performance of the iterative algorithms is studied via computer simulations.	multi-user	Markku J. Juntti;Behnaam Aazhang;Jorma Lilleberg	1998	IEEE Trans.

It primarily exploits the orthogonality structure of the noise and signal subspaces by applying a signal-noise space decomposition to the correlation matrix of the received signal. In practice, the correlation matrix is unknown and must be estimated through time averaging over multiple time samples. To this end, the wireless channel must be time-invariant over a sufficient time interval, which may pose a problem for wideband applications. We proposed a novel subspace-based blind channel estimation algorithm with short time averaging periods, as obtained by exploiting the frequency correlation among adjacent OFDM subcarriers. In this paper, asymptotic performance bounds of the proposed algorithm are investigated by using perturbation analysis. We also present numerical results of the proposed as well as referenced subspace-based methods, including cyclic prefix and virtual carriers approaches. Based on the asymptotic performance bounds, the proposed scheme is justified in obtaining a desired correlation matrix efficiently by reducing the number of the OFDM blocks for time averaging up to 85%.	algorithm;channel state information;mimo-ofdm;noise (electronics);numerical analysis;perturbation theory;profiling (computer programming);rate of convergence;subcarrier;time-invariant system	Chao-Cheng Tu;Benoît Champagne	2008	2008 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2008.10	covariance matrix;mathematical optimization;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;perturbation theory;mathematics;blind signal separation;matrix decomposition;statistics	Mobile	51.85892477496041	79.90508632704669	96528

In searching the proper modulation level of the peak reduction carriers, a modified algorithm to recursively adapt this modulation level is proposed. The adjustment is to ensure that a certain percentage of the reduction of the PAPR is achieved. The percentage is reduced in every iteration until the goal is achieved.	algorithm;iteration;modulation;power architecture platform reference;recursion;subcarrier	Wen-Thong Chang;Hsiang-Wen Chen	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394269	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory	Arch	47.568744576074074	81.48306010897694	96835

We show that the resulting reduced rank MSTxWF can be interpreted as an approximation of the TxWF in a Krylov subspace, allowing for an efficient computation of the MSTxWF with the Lanczos algorithm. The reduced rank MSTxWF shows near-optimum performance for relatively low rank, making it an interesting alternative to eigenspace-based methods for complexity reduction.	computation;krylov subspace;lanczos algorithm;low-rank approximation;reduction (complexity);truncation;wiener filter	Johannes Brehmer;Michael Joham;Guido Dietl;Wolfgang Utschick	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2004.1326949	additive white gaussian noise;mathematical optimization;transmitter;lanczos algorithm;network analysis;krylov subspace;finite impulse response;signal processing;control theory;mathematics;wiener filter;matrix decomposition;computational complexity theory;reduction;statistics;mimo	Robotics	48.54659982809466	76.97437707815861	96969

This article reviews our on-going research activities in the design of ‘isotropic air-interface technologies’ capable of substantially improving air-link performance of a CDMA wireless system. To enable bidirectional high-speed data transmission in the future 4G systems, the problem associated with incompatible upand down-link performance in 2–3G systems has to be addressed. The importance of the issue becomes even more evident due to the fact that the future wireless needs to support ‘mobile server’ applications, where a mobile terminal may act as a data source such that up-link traffic can possibly exceed that in down-link. In this article, two alternative methods enabling isotropic air-interface will be discussed, either using ‘isotropic spreading techniques’ that ensure a homogeneous link-performance regardless of its operation mode (synchronous or asynchronous), or relying on a precision up-link synchronization control techniques to pave a way for successful application of orthogonal codes in up-link channels, which otherwise are asynchronous and destroy the ‘orthogonality’ amongst the codes. The isotropic spreading techniques can minimize multiple access interference (MAI) and multipath-interference (MI), the prevalent impairing effects in the current 2–3G systems. This article will introduce a promising complete complementary CC/DS-CDMA scheme based on isotropic spreading techniques, which carries several extremely attractive properties such as MAI-free, MI-free, near–far effect resistance and low hardware complexity. The performance of the proposed CC/DS-CDMA scheme is limited only by noise. To implement up-link synchronization control, smart antenna and GPS-based techniques play an important role and a working example based on TD-SCDMA standard will be illustrated. Finally, we will also discuss the TDD techniques and its significance to implement isotropic air-interface technologies for the future 4G systems.

The basic idea for this system is to synthesize an intelligent adaptive waveform in the wavelet domain at both the transmitter and receiver to avoid spectral crowded regions. This approach offers better bit error performance in contrast to other conventional interference mitigation techniques that process the signal at the receiver only. Moreover, since this smart waveform is able to search """"spectrum hole"""" and adapt to electromagnetic environment, it could be a potential candidate in cognitive radio technology. The EWDCS exploits both transform domain processing and the evolutionary wavelet spectrum (EWS) estimation technique to extend interference avoidance capability from stationary interference to nonstationary interference. Compared to similar systems such as the transform domain communication system (TDCS) or the wavelet domain communication system (WDCS), the EWDCS significantly improves the bit error performance under nonstationary interference such as with swept-tone and also offers comparable bit error performance under stationary interference such as with single-tone, multiple-tone and partial-band interference. Our results indicate the proposed EWDCS is a viable approach to highly reliable communication or cognitive radio technology."""	bit error rate;cognitive radio;electromagnetic environment;erewhon;interference (communication);modulation;stationary process;transcranial direct-current stimulation;transmitter;waveform;wavelet	Kefeng Tan;Jean Andrian;Frank M.

Channel estimation is one of the key challenges in an OFDM system. In this paper, we formulate OFDM channel estimation as a compressive sensing problem, which takes advantage of the sparsity of the channel impulse response and reduces the number of probing measurements, which in turn reduces the ADC speed needed for channel estimation. Specifically, we propose sending out pilots with random phases in order to ``spread out"""" the sparse taps in the impulse response over the uniformly downsampled measurements at the low speed receiver ADC, so that the impulse response can still be recovered by sparse optimization. This contribution leads to high resolution channel estimation with low speed ADCs, distinguishing this paper from the existing attempts of OFDM channel estimation. We also propose a novel estimator that performs better than the commonly used $\ell_1$ minimization. Specifically, it significantly reduces estimation error by combing $\ell_1$ minimization with iterative support detection and limited-support least-squares. While letting the receiver ADC running at a speed as low as $1/16$ of the speed of the transmitter DAC, we simulated various numbers of multipaths and different measurement SNRs. The proposed system has channel estimation resolution as high as the system equipped with the high speed ADCs, and the proposed algorithm provides additional 6 dB gain for signal to noise ratio."""	algorithm;channel state information;compressed sensing;convolution;decimation (signal processing);experiment;frequency divider;image resolution;iteration;least squares;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;next-generation network;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;transmitter	Jia Meng;Yingying Li;Nam Tuan Nguyen;Wotao Yin;Zhu Han	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962563	algorithm design;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science	Robotics	51.176995465332304	80.04451832784198	97242

The channel fading effects are eliminated by the equalization of received signal, and the equalizer coefficients are determined according to the results of channel estimation. In this paper, the channel estimation of OFDM systems in time domain for fast fading channel is investigated and developed. The time-domain channel estimation scheme is achieved by inserting pseudo-noise (PN) sequences in the prefix of each OFDM symbol, and therefore the channel impulse response can be estimated. These proposed algorithms include both least-squares and maximum-likelihood estimation techniques. The proposed techniques can perform better than the conventional channel estimation with correlators. Some comparative simulations are given to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed channel estimation techniques.	algorithm;channel state information;coefficient;equalization (communications);least squares;pseudorandom number generator;simulation	Yan-Chang Chen;Wen-Jeng Lin;Jung-Shan Lin	2007		10.1145/1280940.1280963	telecommunications;computer science;computer performance;channel state information;least squares;precoding;channel capacity;statistics	Mobile	49.27121498339555	77.68804833201293	97515

We also propose two simplified implementations of the soft-Kalman filter for the case of constant-modulus signal constellations that allow considerable reductions in the receiver computational complexity, while performing more or less closely to the exact soft-Kalman estimator, depending on channel conditions. For non-constant-modulus signal constellations, however, the exact formulation of the soft-Kalman filter should be used.	channel state information;computational complexity theory;frequency divider;interference (communication);kalman filter;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulus robot;multiplexing	Eric Pierre Simon;Mohammad Ali Khalighi	2013	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/WCL.2013.081413.130515	mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;iterative method;computational complexity theory;mimo	Mobile	49.23141734765078	78.22326276844613	97658
e8ecb43a7bacd5c27deaa44b520cd059681c80a6	applying lattice reduction technique to space-time coded multiplexing systems		Latest communications standards have incorporated wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems combining the use of space-time coding (STC) and spatial multiplexing (SM) techniques. One of the challenges of such space-time coded multiplexing (STCM) systems is the design of high performance and low complexity detectors at large MIMO dimensions, where existing group-based and direct detection detectors suffer from either performance degradation or high computational cost. In this paper, we present pairwise element-based lattice reduction (ELR)-aided detectors for the STCM systems. By utilizing the symmetric structure of the equivalent channel matrix, the proposed pairwise ELR (PELR)-aided detectors approximately halve the complexity of the original ELR-aided detectors while keeping similar bit-error-rate (BER) performance. They also have a lower BER and similar complexity compared to other state-of-the-art detectors. We demonstrate the better tradeoff between the BER and complexity of our PELR-aided detectors under large MIMO systems with simulations.	algorithmic efficiency;bit error rate;elegant degradation;lattice reduction;mimo;pairwise summation;sensor;simulation;spatial multiplexing;x.690	Yiming Kong;Xiaoli Ma;Yiyin Wang	2018	2018 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2018.8390412	mimo;spatial multiplexing;detector;symmetric matrix;matrix (mathematics);communication channel;computer science;lattice reduction;electronic engineering;multiplexing	HPC	45.95906327049213	79.83353465062211	97795

Transmit beamforming is a low complexity technique that helps in achieving the full diversity afforded by the multiple antenna environment. MIMO-OFDMA systems using opportunistic beamforming are a promising solution to satisfy the growing demand in terms of data rate and Quality of Service (QoS). An important practical issue in MIMO-OFDMA systems is the feedback load. As a large number of carriers (e.g. 2048 for WiMax) is usually used in such systems, feeding back full Channel State Information at the transmitter (CSIT) for each carrier is prohibitive. In this paper, the problem of feedback reduction in MIMO-OFDMA opportunistic beamforming is addressed. We present different partial CSIT schemes that reduce significantly the feedback overload at little expense of system throughput.	beamforming;channel capacity;channel state information;cooperative mimo;crew scheduling;mimo-ofdm;quality of service;scheduling (computing);throughput;transmitter;uncompressed video	Issam Toufik;Hojin Kim	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.255518	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;feedback;precoding;statistics	Mobile	40.29668073055547	85.83505728991489	97879

The proposed method is compared to the conventional MC-CDMA and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). First we show that the signal-to-noise and interference power ratio (SINR) after minimum mean squared error (MMSE)-based equalization is represented as a weighted average of the instantaneous SNR of the respective subcarriers to which the spread symbols are mapped, where the weighting factor is determined by the respective chip power of the spreading sequence. Based on this, we propose a method for channel-dependent adaptive spreading code selection in which the minimum SINR among code multiplexed users is maximized. The simulation results show that the proposed adaptive spreading code matrix selection increases the minimum SINR at the outage probability of 10-2 by approximately 1 dB compared to the OFDMA with channel-dependent subcarrier allocation (frequency-domain scheduling).	code;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency divider;histogram equalization;interference (communication);mean squared error;multiplexing;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;sun outage;telecommunications link	Shota Yoshimura;Kenichi Higuchi	2011	2011 IEEE 73rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2011.5956760	chip;electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management	EDA	39.766139815729545	84.35406754550968	97967

The adaptive turbo code scheme is based on a subband adaptive method, and compares two adaptive systems: a conventional approach where a separate turbo code is used for each subband, and a single turbo code adaptive system which uses a single turbo code over all subbands. Five modulation schemes (BPSK, QPSK, 8AMPM, 16QAM, and 64QAM) are employed and turbo code rates considered are 1/2 and 1/3. The performances of both systems with high (10−2) and low (10−4) BER targets are compared. Simulation results for throughput and BER show that the single turbo code adaptive system provides a significant improvement.	adaptive system;algorithm;channel state information;code rate;forward error correction;modulation;multiplexing;numerical analysis;performance;shannon (unit);simulation;throughput;turbo code;x.690	Lei Ye;Alister G.

The design of the Bayesian MUD advocated is based on extending the optimum single-user Bayesian design to multiuser OFDM signals modeled by a Gaussian mixture, rather than by a single Gaussian distribution, when characterizing the conditional PDF of the received signal. In order to reduce the complexity of the Bayesian MUD, we introduce an a priori information threshold and then discard the low- probability terms during the calculation of the extrinsic information generated . The achievable complexity reduction as a function of different threshold values is analyzed and the best tradeoff values are derived with the aid of simulation. Both non-systematic and recursive systematic convolutional codes are used for exchanging extrinsic information with the MUD for the sake of achieving a turbo-detection aided iteration gain. The convergence behavior of the proposed low-complexity Bayesian turbo MUD is investigated using Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart analysis and compared to that of Soft Interference Cancellation aided Minimum Mean Square Error (SIC-MMSE) MUD schemes. As expected, the simulation results show that the proposed low-complexity Bayesian Turbo MUD outperforms the SIC-MMSE MUDs. A substantial benefit of the proposed MUD is that it is potentially capable of supporting up to three times higher number of users than the number of receiver antennas. In this challenging multiuser scenario, the resultant channel- matrix becomes rank-deficient, resulting in a linearly non-separable detector output phasor constellation, when classic linear receivers tend to exhibit a poor performance.	bayesian experimental design;bayesian network;convolutional code;exit chart;high-throughput computing;iteration;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;mud;mean squared error;multi-user;multiplexing;mutual information;ozoneweb;phasor;portable document format;recursion;reduction (complexity);resultant;simplified instructional computer;simulation;standard database management analysis;statistical interference;throughput	Lei Xu;Sheng Chen;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2007	2007 IEEE 66th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2007.131	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics	ML	46.6336642811228	75.75097895715359	98354

The proposed inner-outer decoder structures exploit the Soft-Output M algorithm (SOMA) to calculate bit-likelihood estimates via a limited search on a tree. A key element of the proposed designs is the way the SOMA front-end adapts at each iteration to new extrinsic information. This front-end defines the tree, both in terms of the order in which symbols are considered, as well as in terms of the subspaces used in the likelihood calculations at each depth in the tree. The proposed SOMA front-ends are different from the conventional QR-decomposition front-ends and provide a systematic way to adapt both the order and the subspaces at each iteration in an iterative decoding structure. Simulations for 4 × 4 16 QAM systems show that the proposed iterative receivers can yield significant performance gains over receivers using non-adaptive conventional front-ends.	algorithm;computer simulation;iteration;mimo;modulation;multi-user;qr decomposition	Haralabos C.

Although compressive sensing (CS) based CSIT estimation approaches have been proposed to reduce the pilot training overhead for massive MIMO systems, the existing schemes cannot properly dimension the minimum required pilot symbols to estimate the CSIT of all users at the required CSIT quality, because of the loose bounds on the required number of measurements for successful CS recovery and the unknown sparsity levels of user channels. In this paper, we propose a robust closed-loop compressive CSIT feedback and estimation framework which not only exploits the joint sparsity structure of the multi-user (MU) massive MIMO channels to improve the CSIT estimation performance, but also has the learning capability to adapt to the minimum pilot and feedback resources needed under unknown and time-varying channel sparsity levels. We establish the convergence of the proposed closed-loop adaptation algorithm. Simulations show that the proposed framework has substantial performance gain over conventional open-loop algorithms and is robust to dynamic sparsity and model mismatch.	autonomous robot;channel state information;compressed sensing;computer simulation;duplex (telecommunications);feedback;mimo;multi-user;overhead (computing);randomized algorithm;sparse matrix	Feibai Zhu;An Liu;Vincent K.

In this paper, a novel transmission scheme called time-frequency training OFDM (TFT-OFDM) is proposed. The time-frequency joint channel estimation for TFT-OFDM utilizes the time-domain training sequence without interference cancellation to merely acquire the time delay profile of the channel, while the path coefficients are estimated by using the frequency-domain group pilots. The redundant group pilots only occupy about 1% of the useful subcarriers, thus TFT-OFDM still has much higher spectral efficiency than CP-OFDM by about 10%. Simulation results also demonstrate that TFT-OFDM outperforms CP-OFDM and TDS-OFDM over time-varying channels.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);broadcast delay;channel state information;ici (programming language);interference (communication);iterative method;mimo;mimo-ofdm;overhead (computing);path coefficient;simulation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display	Linglong Dai;Zhaocheng Wang;Jintao Wang;Jun Wang	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6133989	real-time computing;time–frequency analysis;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science	Vision	48.17731180321876	79.17206808331137	98653

The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated for different pilot location in the frequency domain, and also in combination with the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spreading technique proposed in [Heung-Gyoon Ryu, et al., 2007]; in order to further reduce the PAPR. Simulation results show that the new technique achieves significant PAPR reductions, which are further enhanced when it is combined with DFT spreading. The simulation results also show that the performance of the technique is dependent on the pilot positions. In addition, further investigation was performed where the reduction tones are constrained, equal to the average power mask for the data tones, by a simple projection rule in the frequency domain both for the TR scheme and for the combined scheme. Simulation results show that the contiguous pilot arrangement provides better PAPR reduction performance in both cases, when the peak-cancellation signal is constrained in the frequency domain.	algorithm;compaq lte;discrete fourier transform;frequency divider;gradient;multiplexing;performance;power architecture platform reference;simulation;telecommunications link	Sundarampillai Janaaththanan;Christos Kasparis;Barry G.

CFO destroys the orthogonality of the subcarriers and introduces intercarrier interference (ICI), reducing the system performance. Previously, tone reservation (TR) was considered for reducing the peak interference-to-carrier ratio (PICR) and shown to provide significant PICR reduction. In this paper, we use submatrices of the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce the number of variables in the optimization to efficiently compute the optimal tones. Performance results are presented which demonstrate that the proposed algorithm yields PICR performance similar to that with the previous TR technique.	algorithm;carrier frequency offset;catastrophic interference;computation;computational complexity theory;fast fourier transform;frequency divider;ici (programming language);interference (communication);linear programming;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;optimization problem;reserved word;run time (program lifecycle phase);subcarrier;time complexity;transmitter	Abolfazl Ghassemi;T.

b97a0146fa23c8235b74a636518f92e614121d84	joint interference suppression and multiuser detection schemes for multi-cell wireless relay communications: a three-cell case		To cope with the interference problem in three-cell wireless relay systems, this paper proposes two schemes that perform interference suppression and multiuser detection. The proposed schemes do not require channel state information (CSI) feedback, and their computational complexity is much less than that of the maximum likelihood detection (MLD), which is considered in the optimal detection scheme. Of the two proposed schemes, the minimum mean-square error (MMSE)-based scheme estimates the weight coefficients for the interference suppression under the MMSE criterion. The other proposed scheme, the recursive least squares (RLS)-based scheme, directly estimates the weight coefficients using the RLS algorithm. The RLS-based scheme only requires two preamble sequences, whereas both the MMSE-based schemes and the MLD require the knowledge of all the three preamble sequences. Therefore, the RLS-based scheme can be considered more feasible. Moreover, computer simulations results and theoretical average bit error rate (BER) upper bounds of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing transmission under three-cell and frequency-selective fading conditions were provided. It was observed that simulation results are consistent with theoretical upper bounds and that the RLS-based scheme achieves a BER performance that is identical to that of the MMSE-based scheme with perfect CSI while requiring much less computational complexity than the MLD.	algorithm;bit error rate;cell (microprocessor);channel state information;coefficient;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;detection theory;eb/n0;estimation theory;interference (communication);mud;mike lesser;multi-user;multiplexing;recursion;recursive least squares filter;relay;sensor;x.690;zero suppression	Ahmet Ihsan Canbolat;Kazuhiko Fukawa	2018	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2780246	multiuser detection;fading;bit error rate;computer science;channel state information;recursive least squares filter;control theory;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;computational complexity theory;multiplexing	Mobile	48.36758159492477	77.41928483512079	98888

In conventional frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems, CSIT is obtained through downlink pilot-aided channel estimation and limited uplink feedback. However, the resources consumed by training and feedback become unacceptable in FDD massive MIMO systems due to the large number of BS antennas. In this paper, a one-bit feedback scheme is proposed to deal with this problem and realize massive MIMO gains in FDD systems. In contrary to the conventional scheme, estimation of instantaneous CSIT is no longer required in the proposed scheme. Instead, a number of predefined precoding vectors are probed in the training phase. Based on the received signal strength, each user feeds back one bit for each precoding vector indicating whether or not this precoding vector is suitable. In this case, the overhead used for training and feedback only depends on the number of predefined precoding vectors and the number of users. A low-complex user scheduling algorithm is further proposed at the BS based on the feedback bits. Numerical results have illustrated the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed scheme.	algorithm;channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);feedback;frequency divider;mimo;multi-user;multiplexing;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;transmitter	Yingjie Zhang;Wei Feng;Ning Ge	2016	2016 23rd International Conference on Telecommunications (ICT)	10.1109/ICT.2016.7500456	3g mimo;electronic engineering;multi-user mimo;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;precoding;statistics;mimo	Mobile	40.76614574031571	85.44109204165598	98976

Since envelope fluctuation of the multi-code signal is large, the system requires highly linear power amplifier. In this paper, we propose binary level multi-code pulse width (PW-) CDMA system. In the system, linear sum of orthogonal codes is truncated and pulse width modulated. The transmitting signal has constant envelope, and the receiver structure is very simple. Hence, the proposed system is appropriate for low cost high data rate applications.

This study compares the timing synchronization performance of these modulation techniques by using a simple non-data-aided algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the timing metric curve of N-continuous OFDM becomes flat near the ideal timing to detect an OFDM symbol. On the other hand, the curve of NCSP-OFDM exhibits a sharp peak, although its time has the gap against the ideal timing. We propose a gap-corrected ML estimation of time offset. From the results of numerical experiment, we find that the proposed estimation improves the timing synchronization performance of NCSP-OFDM as compared with that of N-continuous OFDM.	algorithm;mimo-ofdm;modulation;numerical analysis	Hikaru Kawasaki;Tadaki Fujita;Masaya Ohta;Katsumi Yamashita	2014	2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983167	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications	EDA	49.279762781691076	80.4427989997883	99232

The major difference is that the Log-likelihood ratio (LLR) threshold is identified as a key factor to control the demodulation rate, while the ADM uses decision region set (DRS) to adjust the bit rate. In the 16-QAM SDLT scheme, we deduce the decision regions over an additive white Gaussian channel, corresponding to the variation of LLR threshold and channel states. We also derived the equations to calculate demodulation rate and bit error rate (BER), which could be proven by simulation results. We present an adaptation strategy for SDLT, and compare it with ADM and adaptive modulation (AM). The simulation results show that our scheme not only significantly outperforms the ADM in terms of BER, but also achieves a performance as good as the AM scheme. Moreover, the proposed scheme can support much more rate patterns over a wide range of channel states.	adaptive system;additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;bit error rate;code;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;modulation;simulation;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Yuheng Huang;Yan Dong;Minho Jo;Yingzhuang Liu	2013	TIIS	10.3837/tiis.2013.04.009	telecommunications;likelihood-ratio test;statistics	Mobile	43.364770263276924	77.88214971007257	99255
45fbe4dfe617c8b0296c37f2f9f11ff858f6a986	cfo robust blind receivers for mimo-ofdm systems based on paralind factorizations		Carrier frequency offsets (CFO) is a well known impairment that destroys the orthogonality amongst subcarriers in multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems, and the resulting inter-carrier interference significantly degrades the performance of such systems. This paper proposes the CFO robust blind receivers for MIMO-OFDM systems based on parallel profiles with linear dependencies (PARALIND) factorizations. First, we model MIMO-OFDM signal in the presence of CFO to satisfy the PARALIND model, where the symbols, the CFO, and the MIMO channel matrices can be viewed as three independent factor matrices. Such a hybrid tensorial modeling enables a blind and joint estimation of symbols and CFO. Then, in order to improve the fitting precision of the PARALIND model, we introduce two algorithms for fitting the PARALIND model. The first one, called delta alternating least squares (DALS) algorithm, where we predict coarsely by exploiting the increment values between two iterations of the factor matrices, refine these predictions by using the enhanced line search and use these refined values to initialize factor matrices, this procedure helps us avoid the random initialization found in the traditional ALS algorithm. The second one, called orthogonal DALS (ODALS) algorithm that uses the solution of orthogonal constraint for the DALS algorithm to provide the initialization for one more factor matrix. The performance of proposed receivers is illustrated by means of simulation results, and a comparison is made with other approaches that allow to estimate symbols and CFO in two separated steps. Beside a robust to CFO characteristics, our approach gives a better BER performance than other compared blind approaches.	mimo-ofdm	Chung Buiquang;Zhongfu Ye;Jisheng Dai;Yawar A.

In this paper a simple extension to generic incremental redundancy (IR) hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) strategies is presented for two well-known L2S interfaces: the exponential effective SNR metric (EESM) and the mutual information effective SNR metric (MIESM). Then we focus on the problem of the L2S interface tuning, which is necessary to achieve the highest accuracy of the prediction models. The standard calibration procedure is compared with a new method, based on the average (over channel and noise) physical (PHY) layer performance. The latter, called average calibration procedure, is less time consuming than the standard procedure. Moreover, we show by simulation that the optimal calibration factors, calculated with the two methods, converge to close values thus obtaining equivalent prediction accuracy for the same L2S interface.	converge;hybrid automatic repeat request;mutual information;phy (chip);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;time complexity	Antonio Maria Cipriano;Raphaël Visoz;Thomas Salzer	2008	2008 IEEE 68th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2008.403	electronic engineering;real-time computing;calibration;convergence;telecommunications;computer science;noise;theoretical computer science;predictive modelling;mutual information;automatic repeat request;signal-to-noise ratio;broadband networks;modulation	Visualization	40.73596560402996	80.28876404118033	99333

For the first time, we comprehensively study the impact of timing errors on the performance of uplink ANOMA systems in this paper. We consider two types of timing errors, which are the synchronization timing error and the coordination timing error. We analyze how the timing errors affect ANOMA systems, and derive the throughput loss of ANOMA systems incurred by both the synchronization timing error and the coordination timing error. An interesting finding is that the synchronization timing error has a larger impact on the throughput performance of ANOMA systems compared with the coordination timing error.	oversampling;software bug;telecommunications link;throughput	Xun Zou;Biao He;Hamid Jafarkhani	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8423035	throughput;real-time computing;synchronization;telecommunications link;oversampling;computer science;asynchronous communication;time division multiple access	Embedded	42.72981509975961	82.45734330857934	99523

Pattern division multiple access (PDMA), as a novel non-orthogonal multiple access scheme, has been proposed recently to address these challenges. The performance of PDMA uplink system mainly depends on the receiver algorithm. The conventional message pass algorithm (MPA) cannot fully exploit the benefits of the coded PDMA system. In this paper, we devise an advanced receiver via iterative detection and decoding (IDD) algorithm which fully exploits coding potentials and diversity gains of the PDMA. The simulation results show that IDD based advanced receiver obtains a performance improvement about 1.6 dB at block error rate (BLER) of 0.01 for 300% overload compared with the MPA based approach.	algorithm;internet of things;iterative method;simulation;telecommunications link	Bin Ren;Xinwei Yue;Wanwei Tang;Yingmin Wang;Shaoli Kang;Xiaoming Dai;Shaohui Sun	2016	2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636794	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;5g;internet of things;computer network	Mobile	43.760326379291556	81.07432121216097	99588

This ICI term, which cannot be neglected in middle and high mobility scenarios, can even offer increased diversity if it is correctly processed by the detector, which requires a good knowledge of the complete channel, including ICI. In recent years, BEM has been successfully employed to model and estimate time-varying channels using clustered frequency-domain pilots. In this paper, we propose to combine a complex-exponential CE-BEM channel estimator with a belief-propagation based ICI-aware detector in an iterative (turbo) receiver architecture. The soft information transfer among the different receiver blocks, the iteration patterns and the design of optimized pilot clusters are analyzed for high-mobility scenarios. Simulation results show the very good performance of the proposed novel joint algorithm that not only cancels ICI, but also can benefit from the diversity it introduces, providing specially good results under high mobility scenarios.	algorithm;belief propagation;boundary element method;channel state information;dvb-h;digital video broadcasting;fast fourier transform;frequency divider;handheld game console;ici (programming language);information exchange;interference (communication);iteration;low-density parity-check code;multiplexing;next-generation network;outline of television broadcasting;simulation;software propagation;subcarrier;terrestrial television;time complexity	Lorena Martinez;Pello Ochandiano;Iker Sobrón;Mikel Mendicute	2012	IEEE international Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting	10.1109/BMSB.2012.6264248	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Mobile	47.505664631697115	78.09666485289542	99652

Data transmission is confined to a bandwidth located near DC, while out-of-band subcarrier signals are designed outside the data bandwidth to reduce the average optical power. Although the out-of-band signals at higher frequency are subject to severe corruption induced by multipath distortion, they are removed at the receiver and not used for detection. Optimizing the out-of-band carrier amplitudes over the set of real numbers yields gains as high as 2.6 dB over conventional MSM systems at the same bandwidth efficiency. We additionally apply in-band trellis coding and out-of-band signals, whose amplitudes are optimized over a discrete constellation. When no out-of-band signals are used, the system achieves an average optical power reduction of 0.9 dB over uncoded systems with a simultaneous peak power reduction of 0.4 dB. An additional average optical power reduction of 0.9 dB is realized at the expense of 4 out-of-band carriers and a moderate increase in peak power.	algorithm;distortion;markov switching multifractal;mathematical optimization;modulation;optimizing compiler;out-of-band agreement;power gain;rate–distortion theory;remote manipulator;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;subject matter expert turing test;trellis quantization	Weiwei Kang;Steve Hranilovic	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.255194	nonlinear optics;out-of-band management;telecommunications;computer science;optical filter;mathematics;bandwidth;data transmission	EDA	46.331056994652556	83.4960973348814	99863

It is assumed that the source-satellite (S-D) link and the relay-satellite (R-D) link experience independent shadowed Rician fading, and the source-relay (S-R) link experiences Rayleigh fading. The maximal ratio combining technique is used at the destination to combine the direct signal from the source and the relayed signal from the relay with different relaying protocols, such as amplify-and-forward (AF), decode-and-forward (DF) and selection decode-and-forward (SDF). With the trapezoidal rule-based integration approximation method and the moment generating function (MGF)-based approach, the closed-form expressions of the outage probability of the uplink in the LMS cooperative system with three relaying protocols are derived. The analytical results are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that the outage probability of the uplink in the LMS SDF cooperative system is the smallest among three relaying protocols, and the performance of the uplink in the LMS AF cooperative system is better than that of the DF cooperative system when the transmit SNR is high. Moreover, the outage probability of the uplink in the LMS cooperative system with SDF and AF relaying protocols obviously decreases as the channel condition of the S-D link gets better. The performance of the LMS DF cooperative system depends on the channel condition of the S-R link. In addition, the performance of the LMS cooperative system is better than that of the no relay LMS system in most of cases.	anisotropic filtering;approximation;consensus dynamics;direction finding;downtime;logic programming;msat;maximal set;mobile phone;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;performance;rayleigh fading;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sun outage;telecommunications link;trapezoidal rule	Luo Lan;Lei Xie;Huifang Chen	2014	2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992095	electronic engineering;geography;telecommunications;control theory	Robotics	39.7643752846596	78.66391594193692	99876

Also, the effect of space diversity on improving the performance is demonstrated. The results obtained in this correspondence shed light on the effect of fading on communications reliability as well as the amount of coding complexity required to achieve a certain decoding error rate.

Due to computational complexity limitations, Kalman filters based on low-order autoregressive (AR) models are often used although realistic Rayleigh-faded channels cannot be properly approximated by low-order AR models. By increasing the order of the AR model, the channel tracking performance is considerably improved, but the resulting computational complexity may become large. In this paper, the filters used to track the channel are restricted to have a recursive structure, based on the previous estimate and new observation.

However, due to high dimensionality of the massive MIMO systems, large overhead of the uplink CSI feedback is a big concern for frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. In this paper, we propose antenna group scheduling (AGS) algorithm that combines antenna selection and user scheduling for pursuing further reduction in feedback overhead. The AGS method selects the antenna group with the maximum channel gain to reduce the dimension of channel vector and schedules users in the group maximizing the sum rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique achieves significant feedback overhead reduction over the conventional beamforming techniques (33%~50%) under the same target sum rate requirement.	algorithm;apollo abort guidance system;beamforming;channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);frequency divider;mimo;overhead (computing);quantization (signal processing);scheduling (computing);side-channel attack;simulation;telecommunications link	Byungju Lee;Lua Ngo;Byonghyo Shim	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037316	database index;3g mimo;real-time computing;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;computer science;precoding;statistics;mimo	Mobile	40.03899060944931	86.25245268351134	100067
3f379f5a9b3f87592e9ff788a3a1a035e27f8ce3	discreteness-aware decoding for overloaded non-orthogonal stbcs via convex optimization		This letter proposes a decoding scheme for non-orthogonal space-time block codes (NO-STBCs) in overloaded multiple-input multiple-output systems, where the number of different transmitted streams is greater than that of receive antennas. For the underdetermined decoding problem, we iteratively solve a convex optimization problem with the update of the parameters in the objective function, which utilizes the discreteness of the transmitted symbols. For the NO-STBC based on cyclic division algebra, we can reduce the order of computational complexity of the algorithm by taking advantage of the structure of the code. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional schemes in the decoding of large-scale overloaded NO-STBCs.	.cda file;algorithm;code;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;iw engine;mimo;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;reduction (complexity);simulation;x.690	Ryo Hayakawa;Kazunori Hayashi	2018	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2866446	real-time computing;block code;computational complexity theory;decoding methods;underdetermined system;computer science;division algebra;algorithm;convex optimization	Metrics	39.98190937649339	87.80685302606342	100306

However, this method suffers from high computational complexity. To address this problem, this paper proposes an algorithm based on peak-windowing residual noise, which is generated by windowing the signal samples that exceed the predetermined threshold. Filtering the residual noise to satisfy tone reservation (TR) constraints and scaling with a scaling factor determined to minimize the out-of-range power generates the PCS. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve 6.9-dB PAPR reduction with much lower complexity than other schemes.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;image scaling;multiplexing;power architecture platform reference;resource reservation protocol;simulation	Jun Hou;Jianhua Ge;Feng-kui Gong	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2378811	electronic engineering;real-time computing;bit error rate;orthogonality;telecommunications;computer science;noise;mathematics;frequency domain;multiplexing	EDA	47.94273090826789	81.30891268492269	100618

The compaction is accomplished using one dimensional product code (PC). Significant PAPR reduction is achieved by carefully mapping the points in the compact version of the constellation to their radial symmetric points and choosing for transmission signalling points which result in lower PAPRs. Specifically, the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the modified OFDM signal shows about five dB improvement in PAPR at a clipping probability of 10−4 over the original OFDM signal. This performance is comparable to that in similar PAPR reduction schemes; however, it is achieved using simple single parity check (SPC) product code and at lower average power.	code rate;coding gain;data compaction;electronic product code;frequency divider;map;modulation;modulo operation;multiplexing;parity bit;power architecture platform reference;radial (radio);the circle (file system);universal product code	Ali Al-Shaikhi	2010	EURASIP J.

Conventional guard-interval-based (GIB) estimation method is very sensitive to intersymbol interference (ISI) caused by long and strong echoes of the SFN channel. In order to minimize ISI-dependent performance degradation, we first introduce a suboptimal minimum variance unbiased (MVU) estimation method based on best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) principle, and then we modify it to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results verify that the proposed methods improve the root mean square error (RMSE) performance without error floor due to ISI in contrast with the conventional method. Also, the reduced-complexity method can achieve suboptimal performance in typical multi-path channel as well as the SFN channel.	best practice;catastrophic interference;computational complexity theory;elegant degradation;error floor;frequency offset;gibibyte;information sciences institute;interference (communication);mean squared error;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;single-frequency network	Jung-In Kim;Se-Bin Im;Hyung-Jin Choi	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5450303	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;statistics	EDA	49.20990191267694	77.55302486628605	101169

ce6f5079de3b3d3b7df775378337b2d7a70a858c	an mmse interference estimator for turbo blast systems		Turbo BLAST(Bell LAb's Layered Space Time) [1] detection and decoding has demonstrated promising performance for coded BLAST systems. In Turbo BLAST system, an iterative interference cancellation and decoding approach is adopted to simplify processing. The interference is estimated using the extrinsic information from the decoder, which we refer as extrinsic estimator. In this paper, we propose an optimal Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) interference estimator for Turbo BLAST system. We show that the mean square error of interference estimation is improved using the proposed estimator. As a result, for QPSK system, the Turbo BLAST system using the MMSE estimator achieves superior performance compared to extrinsic estimator at low and medium SNR regions. At high SNR's, performance of both systems converges to the performance lower bound. For Turbo BLAST system with 16QAM modulation, using the extrinsic estimator leads to divergence of the bit error rate (BER) performance, while using the proposed estimator, the BER still converges to the lower bound.	blast;bit error rate;converge;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;mean squared error;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;turbo code;x.690	Yan Wu;Yuan Li;Sumei Sun	2004	2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference		minimum mean square error;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;control theory	Metrics	46.788439667366646	74.86550761798995	101258

One part is the research on mathematical methods in SA technology, i.e., how to isolate the array manifold parameter $${e^{ja_m }}$$ and then to get the weighting coefficient w m for the SA receiving signal $${S(t)e^{ja_m }}$$ . The estimation of DOA is included in the above handling process. The other is how to extract the signal $${S(t)e^{ja_m }}$$ from SA receiver, which should be the focus of the research of SA application. Utilizing the feature of mid-amble sequence of TD-SCDMA system, a novel DOA estimation method based on mid-amble sequence (MDOA) is presented in this paper, by which the array manifold $${e^{ja_m }}$$ can be extracted directly from the SA receiving signal. Making use of the array manifold parameter $${e^{ja_m }}$$ obtained by the MDOA method, the simulation of downlink beam-forming shows that the proposed MDOA method is feasible. This method will result in the research of mathematical methods used in SA being completely abandoned. Also, a usable SA receiver for TD-SCDMA with beam-forming by amplitude weighting in base-band is given as well as the correctness proof by using spectrum searching method in base-band.	rake;smart antenna	Xiangdong Jia;Wei Xiao;Haiyang Fu;Junfeng Fan	2011	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-010-0012-x	receiver;telecommunications;smart antenna;statistics	Mobile	52.68008268076959	80.62151679575587	101701

These invertible CEP formulas are of interest in the optimization of discrete-rate adaptive modulation designs and for computation of the symbol/bit error outage performance metric. We also present new non-invertible higher-order exponential-type approximations for the erfc(.) and erfcp(.) functions based on Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature method. Our analytical framework also facilitates the derivation of simple and tight closed-form approximation formulas for the average symbol error rate performance metric of both cooperative and non-cooperative diversity systems in conjunction with a wide range of digital modulation schemes over generalized fading channels via the moment generating function (MGF) approach. The accuracies of our closed-form approximations have been validated with that of the “exact” formulas in an integral form and via computer simulations.	approximation;bit error rate;chebyshev–gauss quadrature;computation;computer simulation;discrete rate simulation;mathematical optimization;modulation;sun outage;time complexity	Oluwatobi Olabiyi;Annamalai Annamalai	2012	2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314381	mathematical optimization;statistics;approximation theory	EDA	40.905071975336085	75.26272546808872	101780

We first develop a model for such a transmission scheme and focus particularly on multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Using this method, we analyze the impact of time variation within a transmission block (time variation could arise both from Doppler spread of the channel and from synchronization errors). To mitigate the effects of such time variations, we propose a time-domain approach. We design ICI-mitigating block linear filters, and we examine how they are modified in the context of space-time block-coded transmissions. Our approach reduces to the familiar single-tap frequency-domain equalizer when the channel is block time invariant. Channel estimation in rapidly time-varying scenarios becomes critical, and we propose a scheme for estimating channel parameters varying within a transmission block. Along with the channel estimation scheme, we also examine the issue of pilot tone placement and show that in time-varying channels, it may be better to group pilot tones together into clumps that are equispaced onto the FFT grid; this placement technique is in contrast to the common wisdom for time-invariant channels. Finally, we provide numerical results illustrating the performance of these schemes, both for uncoded and space-time block-coded systems.	channel state information;equalization (communications);fast fourier transform;frequency divider;ici (programming language);interference (communication);mimo;multiplexing;numerical analysis;time-invariant system	Suhas N.

This paper studies the relationship between the signal strength and multipath richness using indoor measurements taken at the Brigham Young University campus. It is found that the SNR and the multipath richness can be strongly correlated. Hence, some caution is needed when normalizing out the SNR in system performance studies. Furthermore, for an unnormalized channel, the channel capacity usually rises when moving from NLOS into LOS since the loss in multipath is more than compensated for by an increase in SNR. A theoretical study also reveals that for moderate sized systems, the required SNR increase for a LOS channel to yield the same channel capacity as a NLOS channel is not very large.	channel capacity;coefficient;link-richness;mimo;multipath propagation;signal-to-noise ratio;strongly correlated material	Thomas Svantesson;Jon W.

351200beeb56ced36c82f028455d1ce34b5fbbfa	on performance of analog least mean square loop for self-interference cancellation in in-band full-duplex ofdm systems		This paper evaluates the performance of an analog least mean square (ALMS) loop employed to cancel self-interference in in-band full-duplex (IBFD) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Cyclostationary analysis is applied to investigate the behavior of the ALMS filter. It is revealed that the performance of the ALMS filter for OFDM systems primarily depends on windowing function rather than pulse shaping as in single carrier systems. It is also noticed that the ALMS loop in OFDM systems provides a much higher level of sel-interference (SI) suppression because OFDM signals lead to reduced the error of the interference channel modelling with the adaptive filter. Simulations are then conducted to verify the theoretical findings.

We first study the problem of ambiguity between a timing offset and a frequency offset, which arises when a ZC sequence is used as a synchronization signal. We then show how a frequency offset can impair the timing property of a ZC sequence, causing irreducible timing errors. An analytical framework, particularly the timing spectrum, is developed, which fully characterizes a ZC sequence's timing properties and its fundamental limitations as a time synchronization sequence in the presence of a frequency offset between the transmitter and the receiver. This analytical framework provides a powerful analytical tool for timing signal design and performance analysis of ZC sequences.	autocorrelation;edmonds' algorithm;frequency offset;irreducibility;profiling (computer programming);pseudorandom noise;pseudorandomness;transmitter	Min Hua;Kristo W.

The key idea of SLM is to jointly exploit spatial, in-phase, and quadrature dimensions to modulate information bits into a multi- dimensional lattice. SLM achieves a higher spectral efficiency than the existing spatial modulation and spatial multiplex- ing methods under the constraint of M-ary pulse- amplitude- modulation (PAM) input signaling per dimension. In particular, it is shown that when the SLM signal set is constructed by using dense lattices, a significant signal-to- noise-ratio (SNR) gain, i.e., a nominal coding gain, is attainable compared to the existing methods. Additionally, a closed-form expression for the average mutual information of generic SLM is derived under Rayleigh- fading environments.

The focus is on the benefits of pilot-aided PSK over differential PSK (DPSK) when using these receivers in fast-fading channel conditions. For fading channels, DPSK is typically employed in preference to PSK because *it avoids the need for accurate channel tracking. However, for both the PSK and DPSK MAP receivers considered here, non-coherent quadrature analog front-ends are used, with channel estimation being performed digitally in conjunction with data estimation. Channel estimates are formed along each branch of an expanded MAP trellis. In the case of absolutely encoded PSK, phase ambiguity is resolved using pilot symbols. For our new MAP receivers, the choice between PSK and DPSK is no longer clear. This paper shows that pilot-aided PSK outperforms DPSK for these new receivers, despite the SNR penalty associated with pilot symbols. From a computational point of view however, the new MAP DPSK receiver developed in this paper is more efficient.	channel state information;coherence (physics);pre-shared key;signal-to-noise ratio;trellis quantization	Linda M.

In the proposed approach, multi-user-interference (MUI) is treated as a resource for increasing the signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) at the receiver side, in contrast with conventional precoding schemes from the literature which aim to minimize MUI. Two different CEP schemes are presented: a first technique, based on the application of the cross-entropy solver, and a two-step approach, based on an initial relaxation of the power constraints and a subsequent enforcement of per-antenna power constraints. The benefits of the proposed algorithms are evaluated in terms of computational costs and achievable symbol error rate (SER) in a perfect channel state information (CSI) scenario for different modulation orders. The analytical and numerical results show that interference-exploitation concepts are able to further extend the benefits of classical CEP.	algorithm;channel state information;computation;cross entropy;flops;interference (communication);key (cryptography);linear programming relaxation;mimo;magic user interface;mathematical optimization;modulation;multi-user;numerical analysis;performance;pre-shared key;reliability (computer networking);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;solver;telecommunications link	Pierluigi Vito Amadori;Christos Masouros	2016	2016 IEEE 17th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2016.7536765	electronic engineering;telecommunications;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;mathematics	EDA	41.39235065481603	88.10209043019302	102541

This frequency offset can be divided into an integer part and a fractional part. The fractional part mainly introduces inter-carrier interference (ICI), while the integer part causes frequency ambiguity. In this paper, based on the underlying structure of the received OFDM symbols, a novel blind algorithm is proposed to estimate the integer part of CFO. Compared with the conventional M&M's blind integer CFO estimator, the proposed one has considerably reduced computational load. Furthermore, simulation results show that under the multipath fading channel, the proposed estimator has lower probability of failure than the M&M's estimator	algorithm;carrier frequency;computation;floor and ceiling functions;frequency offset;ici (programming language);interference (communication);multipath propagation;multiplexing;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation	Hai Lin;H.

The paper proposes a batch scheme for jointly performing blind equalization and timing recovery, that embeds the timing recovery process inside the batch blind equalization algorithm. The proposed scheme adds the timing offset of sampling and interpolation filter in the objective function of constant modulus algorithm, iteratively updates the timing offset and equalizer coefficients in batch approach, thus achieves equalization, symbol timing error detector and timing recovery jointly. In this way, the timing recovery and the equalization processes can be coordinated.

27aa470bceb46f1fefe22bf2beac346ac6589dd9	hybrid precoding and combining design for millimeter-wave multi-user mimo based on svd		In this paper, we focus on the millimeter-wave multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (mmWave MU-MIMO) systems and propose a low-complexity hybrid precoding and combining design, which is applicable to both fully-connected structures and sub-connected structures. Based on the channel knowledge of each user, the analog combiner for each user is independently designed based on the singular value decomposition (SVD), while the analog precoder is obtained by the conjugate transposition to maximize the effective channel gain. Then, with the resulting effective analog channel, low-dimensional baseband precoders can be efficiently applied. The proposed scheme requires no optimization techniques or any complicated iterative algorithms, while the numerical results show that it can approach the performance of fully digital schemes and even achieve a better performance in some scenarios. It is also observed that sub-connected structures can achieve a much higher power efficiency compared to fully-connected structures and are therefore promising for the future green communication systems.

Acquiring the occupation status of a spectral band can be accomplished in different ways, one of which is called cyclostationary spectrum sensing. The aforementioned method exploits the prior knowledge of periodicities inherent in most man-made signals for the purpose of detecting their presence in a set of sample data. One prerequisite for the detection is the knowledge of the signal's cyclic autocorrelation (CA), which can be estimated from a finite amount of time-domain samples. This work introduces a new method for estimating the CA using a very small amount of time-domain samples, i.e. a short observation time. This is accomplished by modeling the desired CA vector using a custom dictionary describing its known properties and recovering it by solving a convex optimization problem.	autocorrelation;convex optimization;cyclostationary process;dictionary;full-spectrum light;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;sensor	Andreas Bollig;Rudolf Mathar	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638594	signal reconstruction;convex optimization;speech recognition;mathematics;statistics;detection theory	Robotics	53.49369629821268	81.23410732764079	102853

Using the sigmoid function instead of the signum function for this group of algorithms leads to a decreasing of the equalizer length, enhancement of the step size parameter (μ), optimization of the bit error rate (BER) and to a reduction of the mean square error (MSE). Applying a sigmoid function results in a nonlinear soft decision of the equalizer output compared to the signum function which represents a nonlinear hard decision. Additional to the simulation results, both algorithms are process-optimized for real-time baseband transmission in a digital signal processor (DSP) test-bed for differential modulations schemes. All presented BER simulation results are supported by BER measurements achieved with the laboratory test-bed. The character of the sigmoid-based nonlinearity can be described as a loupe function to increase the operating range of a blind equalizer for fixed step-size parameter.	algorithm;baseband;bit error rate;blind equalization;digital signal processor;equalization (communications);information sciences institute;line code;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;modulus robot;nonlinear system;rate of convergence;real-time clock;sigmoid function;signal processing;simulation;steady state;testbed;x.690	Stephan Meyer	2016	2016 10th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP)	10.1109/CSNDSP.2016.7573991	computer science;machine learning;control theory	EDA	52.32520862976387	75.0221150564965	102904

In this paper, we firstly investigate the $N$-continuous precoder in recently developed Subcarrier-Index Modulation Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (SIM-OFDM) systems, when the channel is modeled by frequency-selective fading. On the one hand, the Signal to Interference Plus Noise Ratio (SINR) is derived through theoretical analysis. Furthermore, with the quantified SINR, the achievable rate is first acquired for evaluating the performance of NC precoded SIM-OFDM.

236bcd12b50fee763fb8ea7b8f3f656d3af12082	performance of multiuser communication system using phase coded linear chirp modulation		Chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technique is capable of providing high processing gain, low power, robustness to multipath interference and immunity to Doppler frequency offset. The paper presents a new phase-coded modulation technique for CSS multiuser communication. The construction of a nth power chirp signal is explained and the design of the phase-coded linear chirp signal is presented in detail. The modulation scheme benefits from the merits of both chirp signal and pseudo noise (PN) codes: chirp signal is immune to Doppler frequency offset and cross-correlation among PN codes reduces multiple access interference. Another advantage is that low cost implementation of the proposed scheme is possible using passive devices such as surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters/correlators. A generic multiuser communication system model is presented and its bit error rate (BER) performance is analyzed in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and Rayleigh fading channel as a function of number of users. The performance of a multiuser communication system using the proposed scheme is compared with that of a multiuser linear CSS system reported in literature.

In the proposed method, a terminal transmits pilot signals using transmit beams which have large channel gains between the base station (BS) and the terminal. Then, the BS can obtain partial CSI through responses of the pilot signals. Furthermore, adaptive allocation of pilot signals is proposed, in which pilot signals for CSI reporting are adaptively allocated to terminals depending on the number of terminals. We evaluate system throughput of spatial scheduling under the partial CSI reporting from multiple terminals. Numerical results show that the proposed method reduces uplink radio resources for CSI reporting effectively, keeping high system throughput of spatial scheduling.	channel state information;computer terminal;cooperative mimo;mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;test-driven development;throughput	Yoshitaka Hara;Kazuyoshi Oshima	2007	2007 IEEE 65th Vehicular Technology Conference - VTC2007-Spring	10.1109/VETECS.2007.348	test-driven development;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;base station;operating system;channel state information;scheduling;time-division multiplexing;computer network	Mobile	39.57170645362279	85.18406167880501	103237

Cyclic prefix assisted single carrier transmission combined with joint frequency domain equalization is carried out to obtain the initial detection solution. Based on that, spatial diversity is employed to improve the performance, where every relayed component in the received signal is decoupled using linear interference cancellation technique, and then the components are synchronized and combined together, so the diversities supplied by the asynchronous relays are acquired.

Such noise/interference is dominated by periodic impulsive noise whose statistics varies with the AC cycle. The periodic impulsive noise statistics deviate significantly from that of additive white Gaussian noise, thereby causing dramatic performance degradation in conventional narrowband PLC systems. In this paper, we propose a robust transmission scheme and corresponding receiver methods to combat periodic impulsive noise in OFDM-based narrowband PLC. Towards that end, we propose (1) a time-frequency modulation diversity scheme at the transmitter and a diversity demodulator at the receiver to improve communication reliability without decreasing data rates; and (2) a semi-online algorithm that exploits the sparsity of the noise in the frequency domain to estimate the noise power spectrum for reliable decoding at the diversity demodulator. In the simulations, compared with a narrowband PLC system using Reed-Solomon and convolutional coding, whole-packet interleaving and DBPSK/BPSK modulation, our proposed transceiver methods achieve up to 8 dB gains in Eb/N0 with convolutional coding and a smaller-sized interleaver/deinterleaver.	additive white gaussian noise;codebook;convolutional code;eb/n0;elegant degradation;emulator;forward error correction;interference (communication);modulation;network packet;noise power;online algorithm;performance;power-line communication;pre-shared key;reed–solomon error correction;semiconductor industry;simulation;sparse matrix;spectral density;subcarrier;transceiver;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Jing Lin;Tarkesh Pande;Il Han Kim;Anuj Batra;Brian L.

Another drawback is lower than optimal sum rates, theoretically achievable with dirty paper coding (DPC). While multi-user diversity could be leveraged via user selection to narrow the sum- rate performance gap, it requires the presence of very large user pools. To help raise the practical feasibility of BD-SDM, we propose a scheme that jointly reduces CSI feedback while approaching optimal DPC sum rates with smaller user-pool sizes. Additionally, BD-SDM offers the flexibility for spatial mode allocation to cater for individual transmission rate requirements. This presents a challenging resource allocation problem because mode selection at one terminal affects the rates achieved at all other terminals and in turn, the overall sum rate. The proposed scheme offers a systematic means for resource allocation, while minimizing rate loss at the overall- and individual levels. It represents a streamlined process that simultaneously reduces CSI feedback while achieving sum rate maximization, user selection and systematic rate-loss minimizing resource allocation.	blu-ray;channel state information;deferred procedure call;expectation–maximization algorithm;gaussian elimination;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;negative feedback;reduction (complexity);requirement;simulation;software deployment	Boon Chin Lim;Witold A.

In this paper, polar codes, which have been adopted by 3GPP eMBB control channel, are applied to OFDM-IDMA systems for further performance improvement. The corresponding joint detection and decoding (JDD) scheme is proposed as well. To further reduce the decoding complexity, a sign aided JDD (SA-JDD) scheme is introduced. According to numerical results, the proposed polar-coded OFDM-IDMA scheme outperforms the uncoded one. The proposed JDD scheme has nearly 1.5 dB gain over the separated detection and decoding (SDD) scheme when BER = 4 × 10−3. SA-JDD scheme requires only half complexity of JDD with no performance degradation when SNR = 8 dB. Finally, the corresponding hardware architecture is also proposed.	application-specific integrated circuit;elegant degradation;hardware architect;ibm notes;mimo-ofdm;numerical analysis;polar code (coding theory);reduction (complexity);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;x.690	Xiangyun Deng;Jin Sha;Xiaotian Zhou;Xiaohu You;Chuan Zhang	2017	2017 IEEE 12th International Conference on ASIC (ASICON)	10.1109/ASICON.2017.8252596	electronic engineering;real-time computing;hardware architecture;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;control channel;decoding methods;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio	Robotics	44.61827019366949	81.12572006827413	103773

The transmitted signal is distorted by channel noise and interference from other sources causing bit error. Diversity is a technology to reduce both the effects of channel noise and interference. The diversity technique is used in the two previously mentioned techniques to send data through a fading channel at a high symbol rate. Beamforming technique is used to direct a signal to a particular direction. Recently, it is used in the aforementioned second technique to transmit data at a very high rate with low bit error probability. In this paper, we propose an alternative beamforming algorithm in this second technique to obtain better bit error rate performance for a multi-path fading channel, compared to results reported in earlier work The simulation results of the proposed algorithm also show expected performance.	access network;algorithm;beamforming;bit error rate;channel (communications);data rate units;interference (communication);interoperability;mimo;microwave;multiplexing;next-generation network;noise (electronics);simulation;x.690	Md.

This study introduces a novel antenna cancellation technique with the use of a parasitic antenna array at the FD transceiver. Elaborate Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) techniques that use parasitic arrays, such as Beamspace MIMO, have been recently proposed. These techniques use the variable reactances of the loads of the parasitic elements to increase channel capacity with the use of compact antennas and limited number of Radio Frequency (RF) chains. This study proposes a technique that can achieve high isolation of the transmitting and receiving elements of the FD transceiver and simultaneously beamform in order to improve signal reception with dynamic adaptation of the parasitic element load values. The performance of the technique was evaluated with simulation. Results show that the use of parasitic arrays in FD transceivers can drastically reduce the self-inflicted interference, improve overall reception and provide radio channels with FD operation support.	channel capacity;dipole antenna;duplex (telecommunications);expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);inverted-f antenna;mimo;rx microcontroller family;radio frequency;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;transceiver;transmitter;zero suppression	Konstantinos N.

Driven by the need for reducing the time required for identifying spectrum opportunities, the idea of data-adaptive and sequential block sampling is proposed, through which instead of examining each channel individually, a cognitive user takes samples that are linear combinations of simultaneous measurements from multiple channels. If such coarse samples indicate that the block of channels contains at least a vacant (unused) channel, then the channels are examined individually in order to accumulate more information about their spectral occupancy states, and otherwise, the entire block is discarded and the process resumes sequentially by examining the next block of channels.	agile software development;sampling (signal processing);spectral efficiency	Ali Tajer;H.

However, the previously proposed ML blind estimators utilizing cyclic prefix do not fully characterize the random observation vector over the entire range of the timing offset and will significantly degrade the estimation performance. In this paper, we present a global ML blind estimator to compensate the estimation error. Moreover, we extend the global ML blind estimator by accumulating the ML function of the estimation parameters to achieve a better accuracy without increasing the hardware or computational complexity. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the estimation performance in both additional white Gaussian noise and ITU-R M.1225 multipath channels.

Based on the MUSIC (multiple signal classification) and the ML (maximum likelihood) methods, a new joint estimation algorithm of frequency offsets and channel gains is proposed. The new algorithm has three steps. A subset of frequency offsets is first estimated by the MUSIC algorithm. Then all frequency offsets in the subset are identified by the ML method. Finally channel gains are estimated by the ML estimator. The algorithm is a one- dimensional search scheme and therefore greatly decreases the complexity of the joint ML estimation, which is essentially a multi-dimensional search scheme. The performance of this algorithm is evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations.	algorithm;estimation theory;mimo;music (algorithm);monte carlo method;simulation	Wei Dong;Jiandong Li;Zhuo Lu	2008	22nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (aina 2008)	10.1109/AINA.2008.80	maximum likelihood;statistics	HPC	49.843585041030764	77.3843035589778	104246

In order to solve the problems, we propose an enhanced DFT-based channel estimation using virtual interpolation with guard bands prediction, where linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) smoothing/prediction and circular frequency shifting are employed. This technique can efficiently mitigate the edge effect caused by the DFT of the truncated channel impulse response and compensate the pilot position mismatch that pilot symbols are not allocated at the first and the last subcarriers in a useful band.

By applying channel state information (CSI) in the transmitter, the BD criterion offers zeroforcing between the downlink data streams of different users. This paper proposes practical uplink MIMO schemes for time division duplex (TDD) systems to co-exist with downlink TX-RX zero-forcing so that the locally available CSI of the BD channel is used by the terminals in the uplink transmission. It is shown that the precoded pilot symbols are sufficient in both uplink and downlink to satisfy the needs of both transmission and reception. The achievable rate of the system is evaluated in conjunction with linear receivers in a time-varying fading channel and with channel estimation. According to the results the proposed uplink transmission strategy provides increased rates compared to user selection as well as non-precoded transmission, without being sensitive to CSI uncertainty.	blu-ray;channel capacity;channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);gaussian elimination;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multi-user mimo;point of view (computer hardware company);telecommunications link;test-driven development;transmitter	Petri Komulainen;Antti Tölli;Matti Latva-aho;Markku J.

General expressions are derived for the exact representation of ISI caused by an arbitrary frequency offset at the output of the receiver matched filter. Specific examples are developed for the case of a Square Root Raised Cosine (SQRTRC) pulse shape. It is shown that when FOI ISI compensation is performed digitally after the matched filtering operation, an equalizer is necessary for efficient data demodulation, even in the case of a non dispersive channel. Maximum Likelihood (ML) frequency offset estimation is revisited to accommodate the case of large FOI ISI. Its performance is assessed via simulation examples and compared to the derived Cramer-Rao bound. A combined equalization – frequency tracking scheme is also explored, in order to cope with residual frequency estimation errors and potential phase noise.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;computation;dispersive partial differential equation;equalization (communications);frequency offset;information sciences institute;interference (communication);matched filter;network packet;phase noise;pre-shared key;simulation;spectral density estimation	Timoleon Vaidis;Andreas Polydoros	2001		10.1109/GLOCOM.2001.965708	nyquist isi criterion;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;matched filter;statistics	EDA	50.56948856680878	76.06756436451914	105243

Without deliberate coordination and cooperation among the active links, there is a naturally occurring misalignment between the symbols of the targeted signal of a receiver and the symbols of the interfering signals. Interestingly, we show that the interference asynchrony can actually improve the BER performance, compared with the situation in which symbols of al signals ay aligned. In particular, we show that symbol misalignment can decrease the “effective interference power” and change the distribution of the interfering signals, in a way that results in lower BER. To ensure that symbol misalignment can be consistently attained, we propose two simple schemes that introduce time-varying symbol offsets to obtain an “average” performance of random symbol misalignment. Notably, our schemes do not change the simple receiver design structure; only the transmitters are modified in a minor way.	asynchrony (computer programming);catastrophic interference;interference (communication);network packet;sensor;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;statistical interference;transmitter;x.690	Shengli Zhang;Soung Chang Liew;Lu Lu;Hui Wang	2009	CoRR		telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;computer network	Mobile	39.36736868428067	82.69105510134499	105340

The uncoded bit error rate of the system is analyzed after taking account of the intercarrier interference due to time-varying fading channels, inter-code interference due to the multicode assignment, and multiple access interference. Numerical results indicate that the system performance is improved with increasing the number of parallel data substreams and the processing gain. The two parameters have to be sufficiently large for supporting multimedia services.	telecommunications link	Hongyi Fu;Jon W.

Although adaptive equalization could effectively eliminate the inter-symbol interference (ISI) with the help of training sequences, the convergence rate of equalization in sparse UAC decreased remarkably. Besides, channel estimation algorithms could roughly figure out channel impulse response and other channel parameters through several specific mathematical criterions. In this paper, a typical channel estimation method, least square (LS) algorithm, is applied in adaptive equalization to obtain the initial tap weights of least mean square (LMS) algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly enhances the convergence rate of the LMS algorithm.	acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive equalizer;algorithm;channel state information;interference (communication);least mean squares filter;least squares;mean squared error;rate of convergence;simulation;sparse matrix;user account control	Bo Li;Hongjuan Yang;Gongliang Liu;Xiyuan Peng	2017	EURASIP J.

One key benefit of SC-FDM is its low peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR), which is highly desirable in the UL to lower down the cost of the power amplifier (PA) in the user equipment (UE). In order to preserve the low PAPR, current LTE specification only allows one SC-FDM symbol to contain either all data or all pilots, but not both. This is insufficient and inflexible for scenarios like high Doppler. In this paper, we introduce one novel scheme to flexibly multiplex data and pilots within a single SC-FDM symbol while not distorting the single-carrier waveform. In the case of high Doppler, without increasing the pilot overhead, we can apply this scheme to multiplex pilots onto the data symbols to allow coherent channel estimation all the time. Numerical simulations demonstrate significant performance improvements over current LTE designs.	audio power amplifier;carrier frequency;channel state information;coherence (physics);compaq lte;distortion;finite difference method;multiplexing;numerical linear algebra;overhead (computing);power architecture platform reference;simulation;telecommunications link;transmitter;waveform	Xiliang Luo	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504332	statistical time division multiplexing;electronic engineering;telecommunications link;doppler effect;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;frequency-division multiplexing	Mobile	46.73422674825831	83.04034735722702	105849

By forming a SFN, a broadcasting system is able to serve an arbitrary large area with the same program within the same frequency block. At the mean time, the SFN structure provides the receiver with a potential of yielding the space diversity gain, while the power in every single transmitter is not increased. However, there are heavy artificial multipath propagation in the area covered by the SFN broadcasting. Traditionally, a transversal equalizer is used at the receiver to remove the SFN interference. The equalizer always cannot converge properly due to the over-long time delay and the over-large magnitude of the different paths from each transmitter of the SFN. To solve the problem, a new model based on the MIMO structure of the SFN is proposed in this paper, where the signal's space information is exploited. With the model in mind, a new receiving scheme is derived. By using a beamformer, signals with different incident angles are separated, so the problem caused by the over-long delay and the over-large magnitude is avoided. A bank of parallel sub-filters are used to remove the residual multipath spread. The space diversity gain is obtained at the output of a combiner.	beamforming;broadcast delay;converge;diplexer;direction of arrival;equalization (communications);interference (communication);mimo;multipath propagation;power dividers and directional couplers;simulation;single-frequency network;software propagation;transmitter	Lijun Zhang;Lin Gui;Yantao Qiao;Wenjun Zhang	2004	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2003.822985	electronic engineering;digital television;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering	Mobile	47.19959269069629	80.16895757836211	105909

This paper is concerned with the problem of how to quickly and accurately locate an unoccupied channel or determine that there is no unoccupied channel, from multiple (yet finite) candidate channels for a SU with a single detector. To design channel search algorithms, we propose a design criterion that minimizes average searching time subject to constraints on the error probabilities for a multichannel system. Relying on the proposed design criterion, we develop two efficient channel search algorithms that are based on a sequential application of the sequential probability ratio test and energy detection to the candidate channels.	cognitive radio;search algorithm;search problem	Yan Xin;Guosen Yue;Lifeng Lai	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683299	spectrum;cognitive radio;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;probability of error;probability;sequential probability ratio test;statistics;search algorithm	EDA	47.409828972895106	87.67853904870644	105969

However, in a high mobility environment, the channel changes within a STBC codeword and the BER performance significantly degrades due to the interference caused by the orthogonality distortion of STBC codeword. In this paper, we propose a multi-block (MB)-frequency-domain equalization (FDE) for SC-STBC-TDD transmission in a high mobility environment. The STBC codeword consists of multiple signal blocks. The proposed MB-FDE uses jointly optimized multiple FDE weight matrices, each associated with each signal block in a STBC codeword. We evaluate, by computer simulation, the BER performance when using the proposed transmit/receive MB-FDE and show that the proposed MB-FDE achieves a good BER performance in a high mobility environment.	adobe framemaker;bit error rate;channel state information;code word;computer simulation;distortion;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);iteration;mobile phone;test-driven development;x.690	Hiroyuki Miyazaki;Fumiyuki Adachi	2014	2014 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906391	real-time computing;telecommunications	Mobile	42.51791706145094	81.55359331471051	106027

The coefficients for data magnitude modulation are obtainedby using an iterative design loop. The parameters of this loop aretuned to obtain maximum gain. Roll-off factors from 10% to 100% are considered, with emphasis on small roll-off values for incr eased bandwidth efficiency. It is shown that a gain of almost 6dB can ideally be obtained for a roll-off factor of 10%. Error correction coding is used to compensate for the increased sensitivity t o noise of the magnitude modulated data. The loss due to this increas ed sensitivity is reduced from almost 5.5dB to 1.2dB for a rolloff factor of 10% by using high rate product codes, thus giving an overall gain of 4.8dB. Trade offs between spectral regrowth and impl ementation are addressed.	audio power amplifier;code;coefficient;communications satellite;control flow;decade (log scale);forward error correction;iterative design;iterative method;modulation;roll-off;spectral efficiency	Marcel Ambroze;Martin Tomlinson;Graham Wade	2003		10.1109/ICC.2003.1204001	information engineering;telecommunications;computer science;communications satellite	HCI	47.76731446028185	81.69218124552194	106233

This method does not require any assumption regarding the statistical or spectral distribution of multiple access interference (MAI), and it is also not necessary to assume that the fading encountered by the subcarriers is independent of each other.

Independent fading between diversity channels is assumed. Channel average powers may be distinctive, identical, or mixed with both. The rectangular M-QAM results are extended to square M-QAM, M-PAM, and binary antipodal signaling. All derived expressions are in elementary forms without complicated high-order transcendental functions and unevaluated integrals and, hence, are strictly exact and can be readily simulated by the computer. Moreover, it is shown that mixed Rayleigh fading results can be readily extended to various Nakagami-m fading results. A four-transmit-antenna system with a half-rate OSTBC for 16-QAM signaling is used to demonstrate that the theoretical result is in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo simulated result. From simulation curves, it is shown that, under the independent channel fading condition, channels with identical powers have better error rate performance than channels with distinctive powers.	block code;half rate;monte carlo method;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;symantec endpoint protection	Hong-Yu Liu;Rainfield Y.

After high rate physical users are modelled as several corresponding low rate virtual users, the space-time signature vectors of the low rate virtual users are derived. Then, these space-time signature vectors are estimated blindly based on a subspace projection algorithm to realize multirate multiuser detection without computing the ambiguous complex factor between the true and the estimated signature vectors. The proposed scheme can increase system performance and capacity by introducing spatial domain processing. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed scheme is close to that of a minimum mean-square error multiuser detector with perfect channel information and that it can increase the system capacity about two times to employ a two-element antenna array.	algorithm;channel capacity;interference (communication);multi-user;simulation;telecommunications link	Yiwen Zhang;Qinye Yin;Le Ding;Ronghai Sun	2005	2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1465933	minimum mean square error;code division multiple access;electronic engineering;real-time computing;process simulation;antenna diversity;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;base station;space time;estimation theory;antenna array;statistics	Arch	47.709926546432875	77.61517256822167	106836

Main motivation for the selection of Hp is to gain the same spectral efficiency benefits as that of H, but at a lower computational and RF hardware cost. In this contribution, we first present an analogy between the antenna and user selection problems. Secondly, a matrix volume maximization criterion that is applicable to both problems have been presented. We have proposed a low complexity deterministic algorithm for the selection of antennas/users such that the volume of Hp is maximum. We have shown that under particular channel propagation setup, smaller subsets can provide the same spectral efficiency as that of the full MIMO channel. We used a 3D extension of the WINNER channel model at center frequency 2.53 GHz to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.	channel (communications);column (database);deterministic algorithm;entropy maximization;mimo;mimo-ofdm;radio frequency;selection algorithm;simulation;software propagation;spectral efficiency	Naveed Iqbal;Christian Schneider;Reiner S.

Under additive impulsive noise, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) in the OFDM receiver introduces time-dependence in the subcarrier noise statistics. As a result, complexity of optimal detection becomes exponential in the number of subcarriers. Many previous approaches assume a statistical model of the impulsive noise and use parametric methods in the receiver to mitigate impulsive noise. Parametric methods degrade with increasing model mismatch, and require training and parameter estimation. In this paper, we apply sparse Bayesian learning techniques to estimate and mitigate impulsive noise in OFDM systems without the need for training. We propose two non-parametric iterative algorithms: (1) estimate impulsive noise by its projection onto null and pilot tones so that the OFDM symbol is recovered by subtracting out the impulsive noise estimate; and (2) jointly estimate the OFDM symbol and impulsive noise utilizing information on all tones. In our simulations, the estimators achieve 5dB and 10dB SNR gains in communication performance respectively, as compared to conventional OFDM receivers.	additive model;algorithm;compaq lte;estimation theory;fast fourier transform;iterative method;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sparse matrix;statistical model;subcarrier;time complexity;utility functions on indivisible goods	Jing Lin;Marcel Nassar;Brian L.

Low-cost RF chains can be employed to reduce the Base Station (BS) cost, however this may require additional baseband processing to handle induced distortions due to the hardware impairments. In this article the reduction of Peak-to-Average power Ratio (PAR) of the transmitted signals and IQ imbalance in the mixer are analyzed for the down-link. We analyze various pre-coding schemes and estimate the required processing energy per transmitted information bit. Simulation on gate-level show that the energy cost of performing pre-coding and tackling of hardware impairments are low, in the order of few pJ per bit.

This structure enables a simple, robust, and practical autocorrelation detector to be implemented in the receiver. It overcomes the major hurdle to the practical implementation of conventional transmitted reference (TR) systems, i.e., the long-wideband-delay-line requirement. TRPC is also compatible with the signal format proposed within the IEEE 802.15.4a Working Group for coherent and noncoherent systems. The performance of the proposed TRPC receiver and noncoherent pulse-position modulation (NC-PPM) with energy detection are analyzed and compared. Simulation results show that TRPC outperforms the conventional TR, NC-PPM, the recently proposed dual-pulse scheme, and the frequency-shifted reference system. In particular, it achieves power saving over NC-PPM by about 1.3-1.9 dB for IEEE 802.15.4a channel model 1 and 1.3-2.3 dB for channel model 8.	analog delay line;autocorrelation;channel (communications);coherence (physics);modulation;simulation;transistor;ultra-wideband	Xiaodai Dong;Li Jin;Philip V.

A state-space model with a priori information and the corresponding Kalman filtering (KF) and Kalman smoothing (KS) operations are developed. The KF operations perform a linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) equalization procedure with soft interference cancellation. In addition, the KF and KS operations produce and exchange the updated extrinsic information. During this IEKFS process, the soft estimate of a desired symbol does not participate in the equalization procedures for the desired symbol; only the feedback information of the other transmit symbols is used. Therefore, the proposed IEKFS performs iterative linear MMSE equalization based on the Kalman framework and turbo principle. The complexity of the IEKFS is linear with respect to the number of transmit signal vectors in a transmission block, and simulation results show that the IEKFS can achieve near-optimum bit error rate performances approaching the matched filter bound (MFB) of the channel in various environments.	bit error rate;equalization (communications);information sciences institute;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;kalman filter;mimo;matched filter;monte carlo method;performance;simulation;smoothing;state space;turbo code;turbo equalizer;windows legacy audio components;x.690	Sangjoon Park;Sooyong Choi	2015	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2015.2457399	kalman filter;invariant extended kalman filter;fast kalman filter;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;extended kalman filter;moving horizon estimation;statistics;mimo	Robotics	47.52264453455813	74.52330375928504	107313

On the assumption of independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) transmitted data the algorithm has fast convergence properties. It is robust with respect to system ovefit (supemumerarily assumed channel coefficients converge to zero) and influence of modest additive white Gaussian noise even in mixedphase moving average channels. The complete algorithm makes use of a-priori information, e.g., from an outer decoding stage (channel decoder) to improve the performance. Also exploiting training symbols is possible. Despite of the use of fourth order cumulants the complexity of the algorithm is rather low compared with alternative blind methodes. According to the BER rates after channel decoding the iterative blind scheme is as efficient as a training sequence based system.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;coefficient;converge;download;independent set (graph theory);iterative method;semiconductor industry;time complexity;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Andreas Schmidbauer	2001		10.1109/ISSPA.2001.949832	additive white gaussian noise;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;blind equalization;signal processing;mathematics;iterative method;fading;statistics	ML	48.11520853096552	74.68031141536918	107338

Recently, it has been exploited to design the transceiver to compress the intercell interference (ICI) in cooperative multi-cell downlink transmissions. However, most existing works focused on IA-based beamforming (IABF) design in order to compress ICI, where one transmitter has only one desired receiver and hence multi-user scheduling and corresponding multi-user interference (MUI) cancellation are not considered. In this paper, joint multi-user scheduling and IABF design are investigated for multi-user downlink interference channels. Based on the criteria of maximizing system sum rate, we proposed an algorithm that combines IABF and fast multi-user greedy search for cooperative multi-cell downlink transmissions. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can bring huge performance gains in multi-cell cooperative downlink transmissions.	beamforming;computer simulation;greedy algorithm;ici (programming language);interference (communication);mimo;magic user interface;multi-user;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;transceiver;transmitter	Huan Sun;Wei Fang	2013	2013 IEEE 77th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2013.6692648	single antenna interference cancellation;electronic engineering;greedy algorithm;real-time computing;telecommunications;numerical analysis;computer science;engineering;zero-forcing precoding;co-channel interference;scheduling	Mobile	39.68539331366549	86.86161987616458	107407

The proposed scheme utilizes CDMA with STBC and a receive array antenna with SBAA processing at the receiver. The received signal is converted into the frequency domain before despreading and adaptive processing is performed for each subband. A novel SBAA construction is introduced to process CDMA signals based on STBC. To improve the performance of the proposed scheme, we evaluate STBC-SBAA using spreading codes cyclic prefix (CP).

e6e43a20edf7dfe72f94ec61e799a65cd9e2acc7	computational complexity reduction for signal cyclostationarity detection based spectrum sensing		This paper presents a computationally efficient cyclostationarity detection based spectrum sensing in cognitive radio. Traditionally, several cyclostationarity detection based spectrum sensing techniques with a low computational complexity have been presented, e.g., peak detector (PD) or maximum cyclic autocorrelation selection (MCAS), and so on. Compared to both techniques, PD can be affected the noise uncertainty because PD requires the noise floor estimation whereas MCAS does not require the measurement. Furthermore, a computational complexity of MCAS is greater than that of PD because MCAS must compute some statistics for signal detection instead of the measurement unnecessary whereas PD must compute only one statistic. In the presented techniques that is based on MCAS, only one statistic must be computed unlike MCAS. Presented obtains other necessary statistics from the computation procedure of the statistic to be computed, and presented does not require the noise floor estimation as PD. Some numerical examples are shown to validate the effectiveness of the presented technique.	algorithmic efficiency;autocorrelation;cognitive radio;computation;computational complexity theory;cyclostationary process;detection theory;noise floor;numerical analysis;precision rectifier;reduction (complexity);sap composite application framework	Shusuke Narieda	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2017.8050564	cognitive radio;electronic engineering;noise floor;autocorrelation;detection theory;computer science;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;statistic;detector;computational complexity theory	EDA	51.53555226475786	83.21671517914028	107562

The uplink multiuser CDMA communication system model is described in the form of space-time domain through antenna array and multipath expression. Linear prediction technique is used to perform channel estimation. Based on the estimated channel state information, constrained minimum power digital filters are used to suppress interference. The pre-filtered multipath signals from all antennas are combined to get the final decision statistic. The correlation between the successive periods is considered to further improve the performances of the proposed scheme.

A novel system architecture, which is the combination of singlecarrier time-reversal zero-padded (SC-TR-ZP) based ST block coding with chip-interleaved block-spread (CIBS)-CDMA, is proposed for frequency-selective uplink transmissions. Moreover, several decision feedback sequence estimation (DFSE) schemes are proposed for ST coded CIBS-CDMA systems. The simulation results demonstrate a significant improvement in the performance of the proposed system compared to CIBS-CDMA without ST coding. The simulation results also indicate that a substantial performance improvement can be achieved either using multistage modified unwhitened DFSE (MMUDFSE) or whitened DFSE (WDFSE) scheme over the linear MMSE equalizer. Furthermore, a low-complexity linear prediction (LP) based approach can be adapted to compute the whitening prefilter required in WDFSE to transform the system model into its minimum phase equivalent.	decorrelation;equalization (communications);minimum phase;multipath propagation;multistage amplifier;simulation;systems architecture;telecommunications link	K.

This is particularly important since the number of fingers available is normally limited in order to maintain low receiver complexity. In this paper, we introduce a new RAKE receiver finger assignment algorithm (FAA) based on estimates of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) per path, as opposed to signal strength in the conventional schemes. We also introduce a simple algorithm to produce these SIR estimates. A performance comparison between the proposed scheme and the already existing schemes is presented. We show that the proposed scheme provides a significant performance improvement relative to that of the conventional schemes. For instance, the proposed scheme provides gains of up to 3.0 dB at bit error rate 10/sup -4/, relative to the conventional scheme.	algorithm;bit error rate;decibel;interference (communication);multipath propagation;rake	Mohamed Abou-Khousa;Mohamed El-Tarhuni;Ali Ghrayeb	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Communications (IEEE Cat.

Abstract GMSK is an efficient modulation technique for digital mobile communications. In this paper a simple solution to the modeling and simulation of GMSK systems impaired by fading channels and additive white Gaussian noise is given, and its effects on the channel characteristics are also considered. The modeling is based on the well-known linearized representation of phase-modulated signals. The analysis is not only useful for modeling and simulation purposes, but also gives a tool for the design of simple receivers.	additive white gaussian noise;carrier recovery;coherence (physics);embedded system;frequency offset;low-pass filter;modulation;randomness;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods;whole earth 'lectronic link	Enzo Baccarelli;Roberto Cusani;Guido di Blasio;Stefano Galli	1997		10.1109/ISCC.1997.616009	telecommunications;computer science;modeling and simulation;fading;computer network	EDA	42.480220042964795	76.92040618917905	107740

It is shown that this approach degrades the performance of the code phase acquisition and tracking, however. This effect prevents the system from acquiring and tracking long before the data detection is affected by the multiuser interference.	catastrophic interference;code;interference (communication);multi-user	Walter R.

The performance of systems using bandpass sampling is highly affected by jitter effects. This work investigates jitter effects for multiband bandpass sampling systems, and proposes a receiver that applies a two-stage method for combating the jitter effect. At the first stage, a maximum likelihood pilot-aided algorithm is used to estimate and compensate the dominated jitter. Then, at the second stage, we exploit the oversampled property of the received signal and propose a decimate-and-average scheme to further mitigate the residual jitter effect. Simulation results show that the proposed system can significantly reduce the jitter effect.	algorithm;decimation (signal processing);distortion;etsi satellite digital radio;oversampling;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;simulation;undersampling	Kuan-Chun Chen;Shang-Ho Tsai	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)	10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251897	electronic engineering;real-time computing;jitter;telecommunications;computer science	EDA	51.55515912381217	78.79142089226478	107785

This paper seeks to develop estimation and detection algorithms that enable cooperative communications for both decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying networks in the presence of MCFOs, MTOs, and unknown channel gains. A novel transceiver structure at the relays for achieving synchronization in AF-relaying networks is proposed. New exact closed-form expressions for the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the multi-parameter estimation problem are derived. Next, two iterative algorithms based on the expectation conditional maximization (ECM) and space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithms are proposed for jointly estimating MCFOs, MTOs, and channel gains at the destination. Though the global convergence of the proposed ECM and SAGE estimators cannot be shown analytically, numerical simulations indicate that through appropriate initialization the proposed algorithms can estimate channel and synchronization impairments in a few iterations. Finally, a maximum likelihood (ML) decoder is devised for decoding the received signal at the destination in the presence of MCFOs and MTOs. Simulation results show that through the application of the proposed estimation and decoding methods, cooperative systems result in significant performance gains even in presence of impairments.	anisotropic filtering;carrier frequency;channel state information;consensus dynamics;decoding methods;direction finding;estimation theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;iteration;local convergence;numerical analysis;relay;simulation;transceiver	Ali Arshad Nasir;Hani Mehrpouyan;Steven D.

6f5a176172f8211ff2f0f49651f3067ebabaed1d	time-varying channel estimation for millimeter wave multiuser mimo systems		Channel estimation for downlink millimeter wave (mmWave) multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) communications over a time-varying channel is demandingly challenging. This is due to a massive number of channel coefficients to be estimated and the severe propagation loss of mmWave transmissions. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes an effective channel estimation scheme for time-varying mmWave channels. Discovering the property that the variations of angles of arrival/departure (AoAs/AoDs) are much slower than that of path gains, we propose a novel transmission frame structure, where the channel estimation is decoupled into two separated stages including AoAs/AoDs estimation followed by path gains estimation. In the first stage, the sparse nature of mmWave channels is leveraged to formulate the AoAs/AoDs estimation into a block-sparse signal recovery problem, and we develop an adaptive angle estimation algorithm to estimate the AoAs/AoDs. In the second stage, the pilot beamforming based on the estimated AoAs/AoDs is designed aiming for maximizing the desired pilot power so that the path gains can be accurately estimated. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively estimate the time-varying mmWave channels with a small number of pilots.	algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;coefficient;detection theory;mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;simulation;software propagation;sparse matrix;telecommunications link	Qibo Qin;Lin Gui;Peng Cheng;Bo Gong	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2854735	electronic engineering;radio frequency;computer science;mimo;extremely high frequency;telecommunications link;beamforming;communication channel	Mobile	49.92690295229761	80.6453660943219	108363

The joint decision statistic, however, is highly nonlinear and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to reduce the computational overhead. Conducted simulation results show that the new approach yields satisfactory performance with reduced computational overhead compared with pervious works.	bit error rate;particle swarm optimization	Kyar-Chan Huang;Wen-Hsien Fang;Hoang-Yang Lu;Yie-Tarng Chen	2008		10.1109/VETECS.2008.64	mathematical optimization;detector;electronic engineering;bit error rate;computer science;control theory;mathematics;particle swarm optimization;computational model;radio frequency;statistics;mimo	Robotics	50.65418806496675	82.72518936676043	108584

In the paper, the influence of surrounding cell interference on a given base station receiver for various propagation path loss models is also analyzed and then the system performance is investigated theoretically.

Unlike previous works which were based on a fully pilot-based approach, we propose a semi-blind approach that exploits both the transmitted pilots as well as the received data samples to provide an enhanced estimation performance. Superimposed training is adopted at the relay to assist in the estimation of the individual channels. We base our semi-blind estimator on the maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion and employ an iterative low-complexity Quasi-Newton method to obtain the ML semi-blind channel estimates. As a performance benchmark we derive the semi-blind Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). Using simulation studies, we show that the proposed approach provides a substantial improvement in estimation accuracy over the conventional pilot-based approach.	anisotropic filtering;benchmark (computing);channel state information;download;exploit (computer security);iterative method;newton's method;quasi-newton method;relay;semiconductor industry;simulation	Saeed Abdallah;Ioannis N.

We develop a novel MIMO channel estimation algorithm that adopts a pilot symbol assisted modulation (PSAM) which has been proven to be effective for fading channels. In this approach, pilot symbols are periodically inserted into the data stream that is sent through the orthogonal STBC encoder. At the receiver, we propose a straightforward MIMO channel estimation method before being used by STBC decoder. Simulation results indicate that the proposed pilot-assisted MIMO concept provides accurate channel estimates.

Therefore, this paper focuses on the application of iterative intercell interference cancellation schemes in cellular multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems at the receiver side for the downlink. First, the influence of the interfering base stations to the total intercell interference is investigated. Then, different concepts for intercell interference cancellation are described and investigated for scenarios with several interfering cells. The first approach is based on the use of the hard decision of the demodulator to reconstruct the received signals. This does not require the higher amount of complexity compared to the second approach which is based on the use of the more reliable soft values from the decoding process. Furthermore, the extrinsic information as a reliability measure of this soft iterative cancellation process is investigated in more detail based on the geographical position of the mobile terminal. Both approaches show significant performance gains in the severe cell border area. With the soft intercell interference cancellation scheme, it is possible to reach the single-user bound. Therefore, the intercell interference can be almost eliminated.	catastrophic interference;complexity;decoding methods;interference (communication);iteration;loss of significance;mobile phone;multi-user;telecommunications link	Simon Plass	2008	EURASIP J.

The average bit error rate (BER) performance is analyzed in the channel environment and a theoretical expression is obtained. The simulation results indicate that the impacts of biasing and clipping for the average BER performance of the DCO-OFDM FSO communications system can be alleviated by enlarging the value of the bias to a certain degree, and the derived theoretical expression matches with the simulation results.	approximation;biasing;bit error rate;channel (communications);device configuration overlay;distortion;frequency divider;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;noise (electronics);nonlinear system;quantum fluctuation;simulation;statistical model;turbulence;x.690	Shanshan Tang;Jin-yuan Wang	2014	2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992079	electronic engineering;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;optics;optical performance monitoring;optical communications repeater	HPC	40.219099634701436	79.04435109155095	109516

Unlike the linear minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receiver, the OMU receiver depends only on the signature vectors and does not require knowledge of the received amplitudes or the channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Several equivalent representations of the receiver are developed with different implications in terms of implementation. In the first, the receiver consists of a decorrelator demodulator followed by an optimal whitening transformation on a space formed by the signatures. In the second, the receiver consists of a bank of correlators with correlating vectors that are projections of a set of orthogonal vectors, and are closest in a least squares sense to the decorrelator vectors and also closest in a least squares sense to the signature vectors. In the third, the receiver consists of a single-user matched filter (MF) followed by an optimal whitening transformation on a space formed by the signatures. We derive exact and approximate expressions for the probability of bit error, as well as the asymptotic signal-to-interference+noise ratio (SINR) in the large system limit. The analysis suggests that over a wide range of channel parameters the OMU receiver can outperform both the decorrelator and the single-user MF and perform similarly to the linear MMSE receiver, despite not knowing the channel parameters.	multi-user;whitening transformation	Yonina C.

According to CS, the success probability of recovery is highly dependent on the restricted isometry property (RIP) of dictionary matrix. Recent advances in CS suggest that minimizing the coherence of dictionary matrix is an alternative efficient and effective way to test RIP. In this basis, this paper addresses the pilot pattern design problem in spatial domain aiming at minimizing the averaged coherence of the dictionary matrix. We first formulate an optimization problem with regard to pilot power distribution (PPD) and pilot antenna indexes set (PAIS) in CS-based channel estimation. Then two algorithms are proposed to separately design PPD and PAIS. Moreover, a jointly optimizing algorithm is presented. Simulation results demonstrate that the designed CS-based spatial pilot pattern outperforms random pilots and equal pilots, which significantly reduce pilot overhead and improve channel estimation quality compared with linear square (LS) estimation in spatial domain for massive antenna arrays.	algorithm;channel state information;compressed sensing;dictionary;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;overhead (computing);restricted isometry property;simulation	Jing Xu;Ying Wang;Ailing Wang;Chong Yin	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2015.7127478	telecommunications;smart antenna	EDA	43.00797389649263	85.7164629854954	109599

In particular, fast fading channels encountered in mobile wireless communications are envisaged. Such channels are characterized by time varying frequency selective response. This contribution exploits the much slower variation of propagation time delays, compared to propagation gains, to enhance CIR estimation. To this end, we propose a scheme that disjointly and successively tracks the delay-subspace, by Kalman filtering, then tracks the CIR structure. Contrarily to former subspace based channel response tracking, the channel order is unknown. The channel sparsity in the time-domain is accounted for by incorporating an adaptive CIR support tracking. This adaptive procedure combines the last and current OFDM blocks recovered CIR structures. To fine tune the CIR support, enhanced threshold-based CIR structure detection is applied on the recovered CIR estimate over its detected support. Finally, a structured LS estimation is processed. The proposed scheme outperforms sparsity-unaware Kalman tracking algorithm. It achieves similar performance than the best benchmark which is based on perfect CIR structure knowledge.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);channel state information;committed information rate;frequency divider;kalman filter;least squares;mobile phone;multiplexing;propagation time;software propagation;sparse matrix	Zakia Jellali;Le&#x00EF;la Najjar Atallah	2017	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2017.2722220	electronic engineering;fast kalman filter;fading;impulse response;computer science;propagation time;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;subspace topology;kalman filter;control theory;communication channel	Mobile	50.33235826683429	79.45790560934728	109634

In this study, a novel multiple channel estimator, which consists of several possible channel models and can be self-adjusted to fit different channel uncertain conditions, is proposed for MC-CDMA systems to effectively estimate channel coefficients in the frequency domain over time-varying multipath fading channels. Based on the proposed channel estimation, an enhanced minimum mean-square error (MMSE) equalizer is employed for symbol detection of MC-CDMA systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multiple channel estimator can track the channel more accurately than the conventional channel estimators. With the consideration of channel estimation error, the enhanced equalizer based on the proposed multiple channel estimator performs much better than those based on the conventional channel estimators in bit error rate (BER).	channel state information;multipath propagation	Bor-Sen Chen;Jung-Feng Liao	2006		10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.632	spatial correlation;telecommunications;computer science;channel state information;spread spectrum;frequency domain;precoding;channel capacity;computer network;mimo	Mobile	49.40464670439459	76.6401131884972	109708

However, the deliberate loss of orthogonality affects many aspects of the system. In particular, the intercarrier interference results in the system becoming ill-conditioned, thus affecting the performance of the system, and particular to this work, the channel estimation accuracy. Therefore, in this work, a novel channel estimation technique benefiting from the structure of the SEFDM system to tackle the ill-conditioning is tailored. The technique is termed Partial Channel Estimation (PCE) and is based on transmitting pilot symbols invoking the partial orthogonality structure of the system to avoid the ill-conditioning impact and thus, is capable of delivering more accurate estimates. Numerical performance of the proposed estimator confirms favorable estimation accuracy and demonstrates a tangible error performance improvement and complexity reduction.	channel state information;condition number;finite difference method;interference (communication);multiplexing;reduction (complexity);spectral efficiency;subcarrier;transmitter;x.690	Safa Isam;Izzat Darwazeh	2012	2012 19th International Conference on Telecommunications (ICT)	10.1109/ICTEL.2012.6221292	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	48.392550571316114	80.2962229521018	109810

33e2842dadf3c5969b45bc3de65c7032f66b11df	passive channel gain estimation between primary transceivers in cognitive radio networks		In cognitive radio networks, the channel gain between primary transceivers is crucial for a cognitive transmitter (CT) to control the transmit power and achieve the coexisten ce. To obtain the channel gain, a backhaul between the primary system and the CT is needed. However, the backhaul is usually unavailable in practice. To deal with this issue, two passiv e estimators are proposed for the CT to obtain the channel gain between primary transceivers in this paper. In particular, by sensing primary signals, a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is developed for the CT to obtain the channel gain between prima ry transceivers. After demonstrating the high computationalcomplexity of the ML estimator, a median based (MB) estimator with proved low complexity is proposed. Furthermore, the estima tion accuracy of the MB estimation is theoretically characterized. By comparing the ML estimator and the MB estimator from the aspect of computational complexity as well as the estimatio n accuracy, both advantages and disadvantages of two estimat ors are analyzed. Numerical results show that the estimation er rors of the ML estimator and the MB estimator can be as small as0.6 dB and 0.7 dB, respectively. Besides, the ML estimator outperforms the MB estimator in terms of the estimation error if the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the sensed primary signals at the CT is no smaller than 4 dB. Otherwise, the MB estimator is superior to the ML estimator from the aspect of both computational complexi ty and estimation accuracy.	backhaul (telecommunications);cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;signal-to-noise ratio;transceiver;transmitter	Lin Zhang;Wenli Zhou;Guodong Zhao;Gang Wu;Ying-Chang Liang;Zhi Chen;Shaoqian Li	2016	CoRR		electronic engineering;telecommunications	Mobile	51.90741374634741	82.55397027405103	110382

Also, an estimation process is made to find the transition time delay which is the difference between the time at which the MS sends some data and the time at which the BS receives data. In this paper, the effect caused by jamming on the Ranging process will be analyzed. Jamming destroys orthogonality/pseudo orthogonality of the Ranging code set which affects the estimation of the codes. This in turn affects parameters like detection miss rate. This paper also discusses the improvement in the Ranging process where diversity techniques like maximal ratio combining (MRC), selection combining (SC), and equal gain combining are used. These diversity techniques are used in various fading channel models like Rayleigh, Rician, and Nakagami. The analyses indicate that for a Rayleigh fading channel, the code word error rate (CER) decreases by two orders of magnitude for a SC case as compared to the no diversity case, and that CER reduces by three orders of magnitude for an Equal Gain/MRC case as compared to the no diversity case. Similar results are observed for Rician and Nakagami fading channels also.	broadcast delay;code word;computation;maximal set;profiling (computer programming);radio jamming;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;rise time;transponder timing;word error rate	Vidhyacharan Bhaskar;Siraj Khaleel	2013	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-013-1170-4	ranging;telecommunications;computer science;maximal-ratio combining;diversity gain	Mobile	43.29154926677211	76.38908252838542	110495

This paper introdu ces a novel multi-rate sub-Nyquist spectrum sensing (MS) system that implements cooperative wideband spectrum sen sing in a CR network. MS 3 can detect the wideband spectrum using partial measurement s without reconstructing the full frequency spectrum. Sub-Nyquist sampling rates are adopted in sampli ng channels for wrapping the frequency spectrum onto itself. This significantly reduces sensing re quir ments of CR. The effects of sub-Nyquist sampling are considered, and the performance of multi-chan nel sub-Nyquist samplings is analyzed. To improve its detection performance, sub-Nyquist sampling r ates are chosen to be different such that the numbers of samples are consecutive prime numbers. Furtherm or , when the received signals at CRs are faded or shadowed, the performance of MS 3 is analytically evaluated. Numerical results show that the proposed system can significantly enhance the wideband spec trum sensing performance while requiring low computational and implementation complexities.	cognitive radio;numerical method;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;sampling (signal processing);spec#;spectral density;wrapping (graphics)	Hongjian Sun;Arumugam Nallanathan;Jing Jiang;Cheng-Xiang Wang	2013	CoRR		telecommunications	Mobile	48.51723756897049	84.00641918656807	110557

For the downlink of such systems, the authors study the degradation of zero-forcing precoded transmissions caused by imperfect channel estimation and channel variation over time. They derive exact expressions for the mean power of the desired signal received by an arbitrary user and of the interference caused by the mismatched precoder. By using these expressions, they show that for attaining a given signal-to-interference power ratio (SIR) these systems are limited by a maximum feedback delay of updated channel state information.

In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of a ranging subchannel in terms of the ranging code error probability versus the number of active users to attempt ranging, referring to specifications for the Korea's 2.3 GHz band wireless broadband portable Internet service based on the IEEE 802.16-2004 standard. We consider the additive white Gaussian noise and the two-ray Rayleigh fading channels. The result shows that the capacity in the case of two-ray Rayleigh fading channel decreases about one-third, comparing with that in the case of additive white Gaussian noise channel.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;arbitrary code execution;digital subchannel;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);physical symbol system;rayleigh fading;telecommunications link;time complexity;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Jisang You;Kanghee Kim;Kiseon Kim	2005	WiMob'2005), IEEE International Conference on Wireless And Mobile Computing, Networking And Communications, 2005.	10.1109/WIMOB.2005.1512842	additive white gaussian noise;code division multiple access;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network	Embedded	41.11322897124762	78.38154923360902	110761

In TR-OFDM, the time reversal processing cleverly converts multiple time-dispersive fading channels associated with SIMO-OFDM into a single channel with generally smaller time dispersion and less fading. As a result, a moderate cyclic-prefix (CP) length can be used without inducing much inter-block interference (IBI) even when the original channels are long. This paper tackles a technical challenge critical to the success of TR-OFDM, that is, how to minimize the CP length while satisfying certain performance requirements. Based on a data model derived for TR-OFDM, a quantitative relationship between the CP length and error performance is first established and a design procedure is then proposed. Our design reveals that the optimal CP length depends on the power delay profiles of underlying channels. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm the merits of our design.	computational complexity theory;computer simulation;data model;dispersive partial differential equation;frequency divider;inductive reasoning;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;multipath propagation;multiplexing;numerical analysis;requirement;run-length encoding;spectral efficiency;t-symmetry;time reversal signal processing;transistor	Zhiqiang Liu;T.

Several pilot-aided integer frequency offset estimation schemes have been proposed for OFDM-based DVB systems. However, the conventional schemes use only some parts of pilot combinations. Thus, in this paper, we propose new integer frequency offset estimation schemes exploiting the additional information of pilot combinations. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes outperform the conventional schemes in terms of the probability of carrier frequency offset estimation failure.	carrier frequency offset;digital video broadcasting;frequency divider;multiplexing;simulation	Youngyoon Lee;Taeung Yoon;Sanghun Kim;Seokho Yoon	2009		10.1145/1516241.1516326	estimation;real-time computing;telecommunications;frequency offset;statistics	EDA	46.93611603232593	80.6444010048812	110875

The characteristic functions of each of these stage r now dominated by the channel characteristics and it needs to be modified accordingly.

Past researchers have derived results by using an approximate average equation for the weights obtained under the assumption that the weights vary much more slowly than the input process. The weights are then treated as constants for averaging. The new method employs a two-variable perturbation analysis which uses as a small parameter the ratio of the loop bandwidth to the input process bandwidth. The analysis yields a significant correction term for the directivity pattern in interference nulls. This correction term is the result of stochastic weight fluctuations which are usually ignored in most analyses. Comparison of these results to those found by past researchers is given and the results of a computer simulation substantiate the analysis.	approximation algorithm;computer simulation;interference (communication);perturbation theory;radiation pattern;statistical machine translation	Roger H.

The overlaid signals are usually assigned different powers to combat slow fading and propagation loss. For channel estimation, specific training sequences are used for both signals. In the downlink, at each mobile station the channel coefficients and the sub-channel power imbalance ratio (SCPIR) have to be estimated. In this paper, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) for the training sequence based joint estimation of the SCPIR and the channel coefficients at the mobile station is derived and compared with the CRB for a conventional GSM transmission. The results are compared with the performance of channel estimation algorithms designed for VAMOS. It turns out that these algorithms perform very close to the CRB.	algorithm;channel state information;coefficient;key (cryptography);mean squared error;modulation;multi-user;software propagation;telecommunications link;vámos matroid	Michael A.

c57ab8f94b5058dd959e1c35eb8e6aba3662656c	downlink multiuser superposition using qpsk and 256-qam in mobile communication systems		Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a potential candidate for the 5th-generation mobile systems (5G). In NOMA, two types of modulation signals are superposed for two different user equipment (UEs) in the power domain. The use of higher-order modulation such as 256-QAM is an also important technique under consideration for 5G. In this paper, we propose superposed modulation using QPSK and 256-QAM for downlink NOMA, and demonstrate the performance by link-level simulation under static propagation condition. The BER performance is investigated for the “superposed QPSK and 256-QAM” transmission as parameters of power allocation sets. From these results, we clarify the requirements for paired NOMA UEs when the superposed QPSK and 256-QAM is used in downlink NOMA.	modulation;power domains;quantum superposition;requirement;simulation;software propagation;telecommunications link;x.690	Koki Senda;Hiroyuki Otsuka	2018	2018 Tenth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)	10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436777	user equipment;quadrature amplitude modulation;phase-shift keying;computer network;telecommunications link;modulation;mobile telephony;superposition principle;computer science	EDA	43.11185633490467	81.19315863126148	111406

To overcome this, MUI-free schemes, such as Suehiro's CDMA in N. Suehori (1994) and H.H. Chen et al. (2001) and CIBS-CDMA in S. Zhou et al. (2002) are introduced. In this paper a new class of cyclic prefix (CP) based convolutional spreading CDMA (CS-CDMA/CP) scheme employing zero correlation zone (ZCZ) codes [P.Z. Fan et al., May 1999] is proposed. We show that above two MUI-free schemes are special cases of CS-CDMA/CP and they only difference comes from the particular employed ZCZ code. A comparison in terms of PAPR and transmission power loss for the CS-CDMA schemes is given. We consider a pilot aided downlink CS-CDMA/CP employing equalizers, and compare its performance with the conventional DS-CDMA system employing RAKE receivers via simulation. Our simulation results show that, CS-CDMA/CP performs better than DS-CDMA when system has many users.	code;entity–relationship model;interference (communication);magic user interface;multi-user;multipath propagation;power architecture platform reference;rake;simulation;software propagation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;x.690	Nalin S.

These WFs are based on the use of sine-phased binary offset carrier (BOC) with adjustable width (BOC-AW). They are generated by adjusting the width of the three-level WF {-1, 0, 1}. By exploiting the three-level BOC-AW subcarriers in sine-phasing signal model, we developed several forms of BOC-AW by means of superposition and width adjustment. The resulting power spectral densities and autocorrelation functions of the proposed WFs were calculated and introduced. Also calculated were the spectral separation coefficients (SSCs) and the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs). The SSCs and CRLBs prove the efficiency of the proposed WFs in terms of interference separation. In addition, the simulation results show that the proposed WFs present better performances in MP mitigation compared to the WFs adopted by the Galileo and global positioning system modernization.	adjusted winner procedure;modulation;satellite navigation	Mustapha Flissi;Khaled Rouabah;Djamel Chikouche;Abdehalim Mayouf;Salim Attia	2013	EURASIP J.

It has been shown that under perfect symbol synchronization, parallel relays with space-time modulation can yield more than 10 dB power savings over conventional serial relays in a highly mobile environment. We analyze the effect of synchronization errors on the performance of parallel relays, and also study several effective methods to reduce the negative impact of synch errors. Our study shows that when the synch errors are much smaller than a symbol interval, the performance of parallel relays deteriorates gracefully. We have also found that well designed space-time coding techniques, such as TR-STC and ST-OFDM, can be highly effective in combating large synch errors with only marginal reduction of data rate.	cooperative mimo;data compression;hoc (programming language);marginal model;modulation;relay;uncompressed video	Yan Mei;Yingbo Hua;Ananthram Swami;Babak Daneshrad	2005	Proceedings.

This task is usually challenging due to channel variability. Modern satellite communications systems such as DVB-SH and DVB-S2 rely mainly on a time sharing strategy to optimise the spectrum efficiency. Recently, we showed that combining time sharing with hierarchical modulation can provide significant gains (in terms of spectrum efficiency) compared to the best time sharing strategy. However, our previous design does not improve the DVB-S2 performance when all the receivers experience low or large signal-to-noise ratios. In this article, we introduce and study a hierarchical QPSK and a hierarchical 32-APSK to overcome the previous limitations. We show in a realistic case based on DVB-S2 that the hierarchical QPSK provides an improvement when the receivers experience poor channel condition, while the 32-APSK increases the spectrum efficiency when the receivers experience good channel condition.	additive white gaussian noise;communications satellite;computation;dvb-s;dvb-s2;digital video broadcasting;large-signal model;modulation;multiplexing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spatial variability;spectral efficiency;time-sharing;x.690	Hugo Méric;José M.

In this paper, we propose a novel multiuser downlink beam training algorithm to estimate the angle of arrival (AoA) and the angle of departure (AoD) between the base station(BS) and the mobile stations (MSs).

It is the radio propagation channel that determines crucially the characteristics of the entire MIMO system. Therefore, accurate modeling of MIMO channels is an important requisite for MIMO system design, simulation, and deployment. Moreover, the multidimensional statistical behaviour of the MIMO fading channel is of foremost significance to the system performance (e.g., influence of the spatial fading correlation). Therefore, it is important for the designer of a MIMO communication system to have an appropriate MIMO channel simulation model.

A smart antenna is an array of antenna elements that can modify the array pattern adaptively to minimize the effect of multiple access interference (MAI) from other users and multipath. PN code acquisition using a fixed threshold may lead to an excessive number of false alarms, and thus, adaptive thresholding ATM-CFAR processing is considered. In addition, since the interference (MAI and multipath) can be considered as outliers, an outlier determiner is embedded to the proposed system based on the interquartile range. This novel approach of combining smart antennas and adaptive thresholding ATMCFAR detection with an outlier determiner proved to be very robust since it resulted in a serious enhancement of the probability of detection.	atm turbo;algorithm;censoring (statistics);constant false alarm rate;embedded system;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);norm (social);pseudorandom noise;rayleigh fading;smart antenna;thresholding (image processing)	Aghus Sofwan;Mourad Barkat;Salman A.

Due to the low propagation speed of the sound, the relative motion between the transmitter and receiver can result in serious Doppler effect. Even if both of the platforms stay still, the multipath signals along different eigenrays vary in angles of arrival, hence the radial velocities. Such Doppler velocities brings different time compressions or dilations to the multipath signals. In addition, as the signal bandwidth is usually comparable to the center frequency, it is more appropriate for the underwater acoustic channels to be modeled as wideband channels. In this paper, the parameter estimation of the wideband time-varying underwater acoustic channels is investigated. Linear frequency modulation signals are used as the training sequences, and the fractional Fourier transform is the key of the estimation algorithm. The communication scenario, with a fixed transmitter and a moving receiver, is built by the Bellhop software. The generated channel impulse response shows obvious time-varying property, as well as sparsity, in the multipath amplitudes and delays.

In this paper, an efficient user, bit and power allocation algorithm with low signalling overhead (LSO) is proposed for maximizing the downlink spectral efficiency of the adaptive multiuser MIMO-OFDM system with BD decomposition. A greedy allocation algorithm with Hughes-Hartogs loading is also proposed and used as a reference for LSO algorithm. For a small number of users, the performance of LSO algorithm is shown to be very close to the greedy algorithm. Iterative BD decomposition with a single reiteration is shown to provide significant gains to the non-iterative solution. Linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) filter is applied at the receiver to suppress the remaining multi access interference from incomplete orthogonalization together with a simple compensation algorithm with low rate scalar feedback to the transmitter. The proposed MU MIMO-OFDM system is also shown to be robust against imperfect channel state information at the transmitter, providing always superior performance to a time switched single user MIMO-OFDM solution.	blu-ray;channel state information;greedy algorithm;interference (communication);iterative method;local shared object;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;multi-user mimo;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput;transmitter	Antti Tölli;Markku J.

An estimate of the average radar cross section (RCS) of the target is required in order to adjust transmitted power based on the estimate such that a desired SNR can be realized. In this paper, a maximum-likelihood (ML) approach is presented for estimating the average RCS, and a numerical solution to the approach is proposed based on a generalized expectation maximization (GEM) algorithm. Estimation accuracy of the approach is compared to that of a previously reported procedure.	cross section (geometry);expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;medline;missile guidance;numerical method;numerical partial differential equations;radar;signal-to-noise ratio	Young-Hun Jung;Sun-Mog Hong;Seung Ho Choi	2010	EURASIP J.

Computer simulations verify that the 7-bit signalling scheme achieves the same performance as the S2 signalling.

Multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA) is seen as a promising candidate for the fourth-generation (4G) cellular communication systems because it can interestingly deal with the multipath propagation at a low processing complexity. Besides spectral efficiency and power consumption, the production cost of the transceiver should also be optimized. Direct conversion radio frequency (RF) receivers are appealing because they avoid costly intermediate frequency (IF) filters. However, they imply RF IQ separation, introducing a phase and amplitude mismatch between the I and Q branches. A communication system based on MC-CDMA is sensitive to synchronization errors and front-end non-idealities because it uses a long symbol duration. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the impact of the carrier frequency offset, the sampling clock offset, and the IQ imbalance on the MC-CDMA downlink system performance, considering a receiver based on channel tracking designed to cope with high mobility conditions. It is demonstrated that part of the effects is compensated by the channel estimation and an expression of the variance of the remaining symbol estimation error is provided. For the cellular system and the target performance considered in this paper, specifications are defined on the non-idealities.

We propose a modified analytical model for AA, taking into consideration the intermodulation distortion term due to the laser diode nonlinearity and the multiple interference access. By investigating the impact of AA on our model across weak-to-strong turbulence regimes, we show that there is a design tradeoff between the receiver lens aperture and the number of users to achieve a required CNIR ensuring a substantial scintillation fade reduction.	aperture (software);diode;distortion;interference (communication);intermodulation;nonlinear system;software propagation;statistical interference;sun outage;transmitter;turbulence	Chedlia Ben Naila;Abdelmoula Bekkali;Kazuhiko Wakamori;Mitsuji Matsumoto	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5963302	aperture;code division multiple access;free-space optical communication;telecommunications;gain;computer science;noise;probability;intermodulation	Visualization	40.211243530471954	79.14907771240118	112714

The impedance on the CPE side is suddenly changed and it thereby changes the crosstalk channel from the disorderly leaving line to the other vectored lines. The mismatch between the precoder and the changed crosstalk channel could make some of the other vectored lines to retrain. However, channel tracking based on the standard channel estimation method is too slow to solve the problem. In this paper, we propose a fast channel estimation method which needs only a few error samples. The simulation results show that channel tracking based on the proposed fast channel estimation method is an effective and robust way to avoid retrains on a DLE.	algorithm;channel state information;characteristic impedance;constant phase element;crosstalk;digital subscriber line;fast fourier transform;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Chenguang Lu;Per-Erik Eriksson	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962433	digital subscriber line;telecommunications;computer science	Robotics	50.37242214008678	81.0343555482286	112755
dc18519f91f64d21a2125e4c06008b6b7ac016b1	comparison of linear and widely linear processing in mimo-fbmc systems		This paper carries out a comparison between two multi-stream techniques aimed for filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) systems based on the offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM). The first option performs linear processing (LP) and, therefore, it does not take into account the non-circularity property of the transmitted symbols. The second technique considers the FBMC specificities and performs widely linear processing (WLP). With the aim of predicting which solution gives the best performance we have conducted a theoretical analysis that reveals that the technique based on the LP is able to achieve the lowest sum mean square error (MSE) at high SINR in channels with high coherence bandwidth. This holds true when the number of streams (S), and the number of transmit antennas (NT) and receive antennas (NR) are related as follows S = NR = 3, NT = NR. The numerical results show that the LP also gives the best performance in terms of BER if the aforementioned inequality is satisfied and the channel coherence bandwidth is substantially larger than the subcarrier spacing. If not, then the LP exhibits an error floor and the WLP may give better performance, especially at low noise regime.	mimo	Marius Caus;Ana I.

In the ultra-wideband (UWB) regime, such systems are motivated for overlay applications, as well as low probability of intercept and low probability of detection scenarios. Processing gain enables low-power transmission, and the UWB pulsing limits the interference effects into narrowband systems. We introduce a random ternary sequence model and use this to study multiuser system performance. We consider the issues of processing gain, jamming margin, coding gain, and multiuser interference (MUI) for a single-user matched filter receiver. The introduction of episodic transmission, with a corresponding reduction in bit rate, provides system flexibility with respect to both MUI rejection and handling multipath channels. Highly episodic transmission provides nearly orthogonal low-rate users, even with system asynchrony and no power control. Performance of a single-user RAKE receiver is evaluated via a Chernoff bound on bit error rate, in the presence of MUI. The analysis includes the impact of fading as well as pilot-aided channel estimation.	asynchronous i/o;bit error rate;channel state information;chernoff bound;coding gain;interference (communication);low-power broadcasting;magic user interface;matched filter;multi-user;multipath propagation;process gain;radio jamming;rejection sampling;ultra-wideband;visual intercept;x.690	Brian M.

b8a4734e2ff5aa364638cb87f6a01fcb82a3e133	a tight bound on ber of mcik-ofdm with greedy detection and imperfect csi		This letter first investigates bit error rate (BER) of Multi-Carrier Index Keying–Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing using a low-complexity greedy detector (GD). We derive a tight, closed-form expression for the BER of the GD in the presence of channel state information (CSI) uncertainty. Particularly, exploiting the fact that the GD detects the active indices first, and then detects the data symbols, we divide the BER into two terms: the index BER and the symbol BER. The asymptotic analysis is also provided to analyze impacts of various CSI conditions on the BER. Interestingly, via theoretical and simulation results, we discover that the GD is not only less sensitive to imperfect CSI, but also better than the maximum likelihood detector under certain CSI conditions. In addition, the derived expression is accurate in a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio regions.

It is observed that the proposed method outperforms the conventional energy detection (ED) at lower signal to noise ratio. It also provides better detection performance compared to Ordered Statistics (OS) based sensing method. We also use the CAD sensing method assuming noise uncertainty. It means noise variance at secondary user(SU) is unknown. We call it as Blind CAD sensing (B-CAD).

Joint Tx/Rx MMSE filtering transforms the MIMO channel to the orthogonal eigenmodes to avoid the inter-antenna interference (IAI) and performs MMSE based transmit power allocation to sufficiently suppress the inter-symbol interference (ISI) resulting from the severe frequency-selectivity of the channel. Rank adaptation and adaptive modulation are jointly introduced to narrow the gap of received signal-tointerference plus noise power ratio (SINR) among eigenmodes. The superiority of the SC-MIMO transmission with joint Tx/Rx MMSE filtering and joint rank adaptation/adaptive modulation is confirmed by computer simulation. key words: single-carrier transmission, MIMO, MMSE filtering, rank adaptation, adaptive modulation	adaptive filter;computer simulation;information architecture institute;information sciences institute;interference (communication);mimo;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;modulation;noise power;normal mode;rx microcontroller family;selectivity (electronic);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Shinya Kumagai;Tatsunori Obara;Tetsuya Yamamoto;Fumiyuki Adachi	2014	IEICE Transactions	10.1587/transcom.E97.B.1967	link adaptation;telecommunications;statistics;mimo	Networks	47.987363209715326	82.148334718652	113324

Simulation results show that the odd-degree Gold codes give better bit-error-rate performance than the even-degree Gold codes. Whereas the odd-degree codes exhibited relatively marginal loss in performance when the system was loaded, their even-degree counterparts degraded rapidly in performance, resulting in early emergence of an error floor, culminating in premature system saturation. The results show that the odd-degree Gold codes have better properties that make them more suitable for multiple-access applications.	bit error rate;code;emergence;error floor;marginal model;multi-user;simulation;user interface	Olanrewaju B.

938e61b4c1e7d85906a73579b75add53d4287497	hybrid precoding design with aod estimation for millimeter wave mimo systems		Millimeter Wave (mmWave) wireless communica­tions is considered an enabling technology to allow fifth generation (5G) cellular networks to achieve extremely higher data rates for future mobile applications. Compared to conventional multiple- input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, in mmWave MIMO sys­tems, precoding cannot be performed only at baseband due to high cost and power consumption of signal mixers and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Alternatively, the hybrid analog-digital archi­tecture at transceiver is considered as a cost-effective solution. In this paper, a maximum likelihood (ML) fixed weight beamforming technique is added to the precoder, by approximating the signal's direction of departure in the presence of random noise. Moreover, a low-cost Maximum Likelihood Orthogonality Based Matching Pursuit MLOBMP algorithm is then designed, with predefined layered radio frequency (RF) orthogonal codebook as a candidate matrix, which approximates the BS beamforming vectors in more accurate transmit directions.

A particular TH code, selected by log/sub 2/ M-bit data, modulates the basic pulses that are time-shifted by binary PPM (BPPM), resulting in combined MCSK and BPPM (i.e., MCSK/BPPM). The combined modulation can achieve a high data rate without affecting pulse shaping and further improve the bit-error-rate (BER) performance subject to the same signal energy per bit.	bit error rate;code;data rate units;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;key (cryptography);modulation;noise shaping;pulse shaping;rendering (computer graphics);spectral density;ultra-wideband;x.690	Serhat Erküçük;Dong In Kim	2004	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2004.

In the past, many CFO estimation methods have been proposed. In particular, the ESPRIT-based blind CFO estimation method is attractive because of its bandwidth efficiency. It can yield accurate estimates and it works for non constant modulus modulation symbols. This paper improves the ESPRIT-based method in two ways. Firstly, we show how the information of virtual carrier location can be exploited to further enhance the estimation accuracy. Secondly, we also derive a new algorithm that can estimate CFO in the presence of I/Q imbalance.	algorithm;carrier frequency offset;matroid rank;modulation;modulus of continuity;spectral efficiency;the matrix;vandermonde matrix	Tzu-Chiao Lin;Yen-Chang Pan;Wei-Jen Tai;See-May Phoong	2013	2013 IEEE 14th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2013.6612128	electronic engineering;speech recognition;telecommunications;engineering	Visualization	49.32743808419517	78.95623688466725	113788

The realized system covers 2 GHz available bandwidth. This paper describes the design and realization of the overall system including the baseband (BB), intermediate frequency (IF) and radiofrequency (RF) blocks. A differential binary shift keying (DBPSK) modulation and a differential demodulation are adopted at IF. In the BB processing block, an original byte/frame synchronization technique is designed to provide a small value of the preamble false alarm and missing probabilities. For the system performances, two different real scenarios are investigated: measurements carried out in a large gym and in hallways. Bit error rate (BER) measurements have been performed in different configurations: with/without RS (255, 239) coding, with frame synchronization using 32/64 bits preambles. As shown by simulation, the 64 bits preamble provides sufficient robustness and improves the system performance in term of BER. At a data rate of 875 Mbps, a BER of 10-8 was measured at 30 m using high gain antennas for line-of-sight (LOS) conditions.	64-bit computing;baseband;bit error rate;bitwise operation;byte;data rate units;gigabit;intermediate frequency;key (cryptography);line-of-sight (missile);modulation;performance;profiling (computer programming);radio frequency;simulation;x.690	Lahatra Rakotondrainibe;Yvan Kokar;Gheorghe Zaharia;Guy Grunfelder;Ghaïs El Zein	2010	21st Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2010.5672086	real-time computing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;computer performance;computer network	Arch	43.964075043315276	76.77154239748917	113812

A proposed solution is based on Chernoff approach with respect to Van Trees correction. It is demonstrated that the new formula obtained can achieve a good approximation of ideal formula and at the same time provides low complexity of calculation of bit error value. The proposed formula is created for environment of BPSK modulation in presence of multiple access interference and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), but can be extended for more complex Rayleigh fading case and higher order modulations. Moderate complexity of calculation method allows usage of this equation in different applications, where consistent calculation of error probability is required.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation;bit error rate;chernoff bound;interference (communication);modulation;rayleigh fading;utility functions on indivisible goods	Evgeny V.

An improved channel estimation method and interference rejection algorithm are discussed. The interference information is measured on the pilot sub-carriers which are sent regularly in time and frequency. An improved model averaged interference mitigation method parameterizes the interference and noise spatial-covariance-matrix on each carrier as a combination of several low-rank models, each associated with probability soft information. A reduced complexity a posteriori receiver is derived based on the low-rank spatial covariance model. Parameterizing the interference and noise covariance matrix helps in adapting receiver for different interference scenarios. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the model averaged interference rejection method applied to MIMO-OFDM system.	algorithm;channel state information;compaq lte;frequency divider;interference (communication);low-rank approximation;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multipath propagation;multiplexing;parametric model;rejection sampling;simulation;subcarrier	M.

Such transmitters, however, suffer severely from the I/Q imbalance effect, which introduces mirror-frequency interference and degrades data detection. This paper proposes a novel method for frequency-dependent I/Q imbalance estimation and compensation. The I/Q imbalance is estimated jointly in the frequency domain with very low complexity and minimum error variance, by relying on a specially designed pilot and its optimization. The performance and complexity of the algorithm are evaluated through both theoretical analysis and computer simulations. The simulation results are compared with those of existing techniques and show considerable advantages of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, a new time domain I/Q imbalance compensator structure is developed which delivers ideal compensation performance as well as the low complexity benefit. Both of the proposed estimation and compensation algorithms are implemented and their respective operation is verified on a test bed utilizing a commercial wideband direct-conversion based signal generator. Experimental results show excellent performance improvement in image rejection in the imbalanced modulator and a resultant very low EVM values below 0.5% across a frequency band of 90 MHz.	algorithm;complexity;computer simulation;frequency band;image response;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;modulation;pilot;rejection sampling;resultant;superheterodyne receiver;testbed;transmitter	Kexuan Sun;Izzat Darwazeh;Li-Ke Huang;Adrian Jones	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214171	computer simulation;transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;hardware architecture;maximum likelihood;frequency domain;statistics	EDA	51.26367365715921	79.12628681830746	114137

To solve the optimization problem in the hybrid design supporting multiple users and multiple data streams per user, we first propose a coordinated Radio Frequency (RF) beamforming technique based on the Generalized Low Rank Approximation of Matrices (GLRAM) approach and then develop an efficient Modified GLRAM (MGLRAM) algorithm. The proposed scheme only requires the information of the composite channel, instead of the complete physical channel matrix which is assumed to be known in the existing literature. It takes advantage of the coordination between the base station and users to achieve a maximal array gain and has no dimensionality constraint. The multiplexing gain is then exploited by applying the Block Diagonalization (BD) technique. It is shown that our proposed scheme is a practical and competing solution, which can be easily applied to both the Time Division Duplex (TDD) and Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) systems.	algorithm;approximation;baseband;beamforming;blu-ray;diplexer;duplex (telecommunications);evolutionary governance theory;iteration;iterative method;mimo;mathematical optimization;maximal set;multi-user;multiplexing;optimization problem;radio frequency;simulation;telecommunications link;test-driven development	Nuan Song;Huan Sun;Tao Yang	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841700	real-time computing;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;antenna;baseband;radio frequency;multiplexing;mimo	Mobile	42.7095081594942	86.87370269817082	114191
13ab16ad73f7fb1d0ecfebc025e12c8d745f805b	a calibration approach of timing mismatch in 2-channel time-interleaved adcs for multi-carrier signals		The existing timing mismatch calibration schemes for time-interleaved analog-to-digital converter (TI- ADC) work poorly when they are applied to wideband multicarrier modulated signals. In this paper, a novel timing mismatch calibration scheme for 2- channel TI-ADC is proposed. The scheme focuses on sampling wideband multicarrier modulated signal using 2-channel TI-ADC. Firstly, The timing mismatch distorted signal modeling in subcarrier level is established; then pilot tones assistant timing mismatch estimating algorithm is developed and the timing mismatch is corrected through an interpolator. Compared with existed works, the proposed scheme has advantage of low complexity because both timing mismatch estimation and correction do not need any FIR filter. The proposed scheme performs well for practical wideband multicarrier signals. Simulation results show that in terms of Error Vector Magnitude (EVM), a signal quality metric, an average 30dB improvement is achieved in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region and the EVM after compensation is almost the same as the no mismatch case in low and medium SNR region.	algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;finite impulse response;geforce 900 series;interpolation;modulation;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier	Yonghong Hou;Lijun Wang;Shichao Li;Liwei Wang;Hualong Lv	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)	10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403720	real-time computing;subcarrier;flight dynamics (spacecraft);computer science;calibration;wideband;sampling (statistics);orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;finite impulse response;electronic engineering;communication channel	EDA	50.99023175883592	78.14862167019368	114237

Due to the channel effect, one needs to further identify the channel impulse response (CIR) so as to obtain a better ST estimation. Overall, the required computational complexity is high because it involves correlation operation, as well as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT (IFFT) operations. In this work, without the FFT/IFFT operations and the knowledge of CIR, a low-complexity time-domain ST estimation is proposed. We first characterize the frequency-domain interference effect as a function of the ST by deriving some analytical equations considering the channel effect. Based on the derivation, the new method locates the symbol boundary at the sampling point with the minimum interference in the frequency-domain. Moreover, for reducing the computational complexity, the proposed frequency-domain minimum-interference metric is converted into a low- complexity time-domain metric by utilizing the Parseval's theorem and the sampling theory. Simulation results exhibit high performances for the proposed algorithm in the multipath fading channels.	algorithm;committed information rate;computational complexity theory;fast fourier transform;interference (communication);multipath propagation;multiplexing;performance;sampling (signal processing);simulation	Wen-Long Chin;Sau-Gee Chen	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518294	fast fourier transform;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;frequency domain	EDA	48.9803335252041	78.16673453240051	114249

It is designed to improve the average BER performance for high data rate applications while maintaining a reasonably high throughput in body-to-external links of a WBAN. The performance improvement fundamentally translates to power saving at the transmitter and/or receiver, thus reducing battery requirements and size of WBAN devices. Two novel blocks, namely the BER estimation-based adaptive algorithm which controls the set of modulation, STFC coding rate, and power of signal constellations, and the linearly interpolated CM4 WBAN channel model are implemented in the proposed adaptive STFC MB-OFDM UWB WBAN system. Three sets of adaptive schemes are defined, each of which is determined by two BER thresholds, i.e. the lower and upper thresholds, which are in turns calculated from the non-adaptive average BER performance as the benchmark. Simulation results show a significant improvement in the performance and/or Tx/Rx power saving, with the cost of a slight reduction in the throughput.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive system;benchmark (computing);bit error rate;channel (communications);data rate units;frequency divider;linear interpolation;mimo;mathematical optimization;megabyte;modulation;multiplexing;rx microcontroller family;requirement;simulation;throughput;transmitter;ultra-wideband;x.690	Miftadi Sudjai;Le Chung Tran	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6884225	megabyte;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;adaptive behavior;ultra-wideband;system;information technology;computer network	Mobile	45.11750732360491	81.30715878933181	114304

However, the major drawback of OFDM system is high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR). In this paper, we introduce low complexity phase weighting method to reduce PAPR of OFDM signals. Proposed method is derived from property of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of periodical sequences. PAPR can be reduced efficiently by phase weighting method with low complexity. The simulation results show the same PAPR reduction efficiency of proposed method in comparison with partial transmit sequence (PTS) or sub-block phase weighting (SPW). The proposed technique can reduce 2.15 dB of PAPR with two phase-factors and 3.95 dB of PAPR with four phase-factors. The analysis on complexity presents remarkable improvement of low complexity phase weighting method. Proposed method odd case can save 75% and 87.5% number of multiplications of PTS method and SPW method separately. The other case of proposed method, even case, can save near 60% number of additions of PTS and over 70% of SPW.	decibel;discrete fourier transform;fast fourier transform;frequency divider;multiplexing;pts-dos;power architecture platform reference;reduction (complexity);simulation	Nguyen Thanh Hieu;Sang-Woo Kim;Heung-Gyoon Ryu	2005	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2005.1510483	electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;discrete fourier transform;mathematics;communications system	EDA	46.7133048919896	81.14968162044329	114521

We derive the moment generating function (MGF) of the SINR for arbitrary antenna configurations from the cumulative density function of SINR.We show that the moment generating function of the SINR at the MMSE detector output can be used to estimate the BER performance of a coded MIMO system. The analysis is simple and gives an accurate BER estimation at a high SNR. Based on the analytical and simulated results, the diversity order is dependent on the antenna configuration and the free distance of the convolutional code. Finally, we compare the analytical expression with simulated results for validation.	bit error rate;computer simulation;convolutional code;mimo;mean squared error;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;x.690	Namshik Kim;Hyuncheol Park	2009	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2009.080938	telecommunications;antenna;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	41.455797140876065	74.94366921064591	114564

The bit error rate (BER) expressions of the OSTBC-OFDM system is derived for each transmit-receive antenna configuration in the presence of phase noise and channel estimation errors. With emphasis on complex signal constellations, we further investigate the effect of doppler on the performance of OSTBCOFDM for different code rates R : 1/2 ≤ R ≤ 1, including maximal-rate OSTBC codes. To illustrate the extent of system degradation due to these impairments on a proposed practical system, the presented results are verified through simulations by making use of the system parameters from the IEEE802.16e standard.	bit error rate;channel state information;code;elegant degradation;mimo-ofdm;maximal set;multiplexing;phase noise;radio frequency;rayleigh fading;simulation;x.690	Mohamed Jalloh;Pankaj Das	2009	VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073420	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	Mobile	42.78109128487867	78.16839272496038	114815

This receiver structure is also known as a multidimensional RAKE receiver. Expressions for the interference correlation matrix are derived, and subsequently, an analysis of the error probability is provided. With regard to antenna weights, the optimum combining linear receiver, which takes into account the spatial distribution of all the users in the system, is compared with the suboptimum combining receiver (SOC), which exploits knowledge of the desired user array vector only. It is shown how the two receivers, ideal in the sense that perfect channel estimation is assumed, achieve very similar performances under realistic conditions. Consequently, the investigated pilot assisted combining receiver, which estimates the channel based on limited overhead, calculates weights according to the SOC strategy by a very simple algorithm.

But OFDM is sensitive to the carrier frequency offset (CFO) and sample timing offset (STO). As these effects, inter-carrier interference (ICI), inter-symbol interference (ISI) and common phase noise error (CPE) occur. And these effects cause degradation of performance. In this paper, we estimate STO and CFO by using block type pilot and then send estimated data to time domain for compensation. Especially, STO is considered as integer and fractional type STO. Each type of STO is analyzed and compensated. And we confirm system performance through simulation. As a result of simulation, we ensure that STO and CFO can be compensated without equalizer through feedback.	carrier frequency offset;computer performance;constant phase element;effective method;elegant degradation;equalization (communications);frequency divider;ici (programming language);interference (communication);multiplexing;phase noise;simulation;slater-type orbital;transmitter	HuiKyu Lee;Heung-Gyoon Ryu	2011	2011 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium (WTS)	10.1109/WTS.2011.5960825	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Arch	48.26581166220431	79.20155049078431	115265

Furthermore, we derived closed-form of the false alarm, the detection probability and the threshold. Computer simulations show that the proposed SS technique can obtain good performances in low SNR values, which is a challenging issue in spectrum sensing.

In CDMA, a particular class of pseudonoise (PN) spreading codes yields a code-set Grammian with only two distinct eigenvalues. For these spreading codes, we propose a computationally efficient method for signal detection using Wiener filtering. Our approach relies on a matrix inversion step, where we gain in computational efficiency by using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula. The resulting approach involves significantly less computational load compared to popular approaches like Conjugate Gradient (CG) method and the (traditional) Cholesky decomposition.	algorithmic efficiency;cholesky decomposition;code;computation;computational complexity theory;conjugate gradient method;cubic function;detection theory;global positioning system;gradient descent;gramian matrix;pseudorandom noise;wiener filter	Rodrigo Carvajal;Kaushik Mahata;Juan C.

The system design in this paper is based on the joint optimization of the transmitter and the receiver in a synchronous multiuser channel characterized by multipath propagation. Joint optimization is represented by a linear transformation of the transmitted signals at the transmitter and a linear transformation of received signals at each receiving site that minimize the effect of multiple access and multipath interference. The minimum mean squared error between the true bit value and its estimate at the output of the receiver is taken as the cost function, subject to average and peak transmit power constraints. It is shown that joint transmitter–receiver optimization outperforms significantly either transmitter optimization or receiver-based techniques. The crucial assumption, in the case of multipath channels, is that the transmitter knows the multipath characteristics of all channels and that the channel dynamics are sufficiently slow so that multipath profiles remain essentially constant over a block of precoded bits. The practical applications can be found in indoor and cellular communications, satellite communications, or military communications where nonorthogonal signature waveforms are employed.	communications satellite;interference (communication);loss function;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multi-user;multipath propagation;software propagation;systems design;transmitter;zero suppression	Won Mee Jang;Branimir R.

Then, among statistically independent sequences in time domain generated after the IFFT (inverse fast Fourier transform) for the phase rotated sub-blocks, the sub-block combination with the lowest PAPR is selected and transmitted.

Interpulse interference is related to the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the received pulse (RP), the RP energy and its fading correspond to the ACF at zero lag, and multiple access interference is connected to the cross-correlation function (CCF) between two channel pulse responses. Each realization of the multipath channel shows different correlation functions due to the ldquorandomnessrdquo of the UWB propagation environment. This paper derives the first- and second-order statistics of the ACF and CCF, capturing this randomness. Such results are useful for incorporating the multipath channel into the performance and design optimization studies of UWB systems. The analysis is based on a model of the received UWB pulse. The model describes the random channel response by two continuous functions of the excess delay time-one expresses the power, the other expresses power variations-and by a prototype pulse shape representing all linear system components including the band limitation of the RP and antenna effects. The analytical results are validated through the analysis of simulated and measured channel responses.	acf;autocorrelation;bandlimiting;cross-correlation;interference (communication);linear system;mathematical optimization;microsoft customer care framework;multipath propagation;offset binary;prototype;rp (complexity);randomness;simulation;software propagation;ultra-wideband	Klaus Witrisal;Marco Pausini	2008	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2007.907008	electronic engineering;autocorrelation;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;cross-correlation;ultra-wideband;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	40.016196217504934	77.14397304997642	115962

The RM-PTS scheme not only the transmitted signal has error correction capability but also the transmitter has no need to transmit side information. However, one major drawback of the RM-PTS scheme is high computational loads which also occur in the PTS scheme for finding the transmitted signal with minimum PAPR out. Therefore, this paper investigates a suboptimal PAPR reduction method with low computational loads by using the improved genetic algorithm used the partheno-crossover operator (PCGA) as the selection mechanism of RM-PTS scheme. The GA-PTS scheme is an active PAPR reduction method, which has better PAPR performance than the GD-PTS scheme and has lower computational load than the PTS scheme and the GD-PTS scheme. Note that the GA-PTS scheme has no error correction capability and is a suboptimal PAPR reduction method. Based on the same computational loads, the RM-PCGA-PTS scheme with natural ordering has better PAPR performance than the GA-PTS scheme with adjacent partition in simulation results.	computation;error detection and correction;genetic algorithm;pts-dos;polynomial-time approximation scheme;power architecture platform reference;simulation;software release life cycle;transmitter	Hsinying Liang;Zhe Lin;Houshou Chen;Cheng-Ying Yang	2010	2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications	10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649479	mathematical optimization;transmitter;electronic engineering;genetic algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics	HPC	49.88272067537516	82.77683346678553	116108

Frequency ranges for probe arrays are from 75MHz to 40GHz. Recently the problem of exhaustive testing of the high number of multi beam antennas embarked on future satellite systems has received considerable attention [5]. Based on conventional measurements techniques this testing would lead to unacceptable cost and duration. Solutions based on “hybrid systems” taking full advantage of fast probe array technology on large mechanical scanners can drastically reduce the measurement time compared to conventional single probe test systems.

Although inter-symbol interference (ISI) of OFDM can be mitigated by using cyclic prefix whose length is longer than the maximum multi-path delay of wireless channel, the constellation of OFDM symbol sharply deteriorates, which will have an important effect on performance of OFDM systems. For different sub-channels with different carrier frequencies, the effects on constellation are quite distinct, that is, there exists frequency selectivity. In this paper, the frequency selective properties of constellation caused by multi-path channel are discussed and the corresponding simulation results are provided, which can be used as a theoretical reference for channel estimation of OFDM systems.	algorithm;carrier wave;channel state information;circular shift;discrete fourier transform;distortion;elegant degradation;frequency divider;interference (communication);multiplexing;selectivity (electronic);simulation;subcarrier;timeshift	Zhenyu Zhang;Lijia Ge;Gang Liu;Fanxin Zeng;Tao Shuang;Jianyuan Luo	2013	2013 22nd Wireless and Optical Communication Conference	10.1109/WOCC.2013.6676360	channel allocation schemes;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;intersymbol interference;computer network	Mobile	47.80315897215395	80.2081861211247	116159

b320038fddf54b5f2b4d040bf1625d3c990f4c30	joint carrier frequency offset and channel impulse response estimation for linear periodic channels		We study joint estimation of the channel impulse response (CIR) and of the carrier frequency offset (CFO) for linear channels in which both the CIR and the noise statistics vary periodically in time. This model corresponds to interference-limited communications as well as to power line communication and doubly selective channels. We first consider the joint maximum likelihood estimator (JMLE) for the CIR and the CFO and show it has a high computational complexity and relatively low spectral efficiency. This motivates the derivation of two estimation schemes with higher spectral efficiency and lower computational complexity compared to the JMLE, obtained by exploiting both the periodicity of the channel and the fact that, typically, the delay-Doppler spreading function of the CIR is approximately sparse, without requiring a-priori knowledge of the sparsity pattern. The proposed estimation schemes are numerically tested and the results demonstrate that substantial benefits can be obtained by properly accounting for the approximate sparsity and periodicity in the design of the estimation scheme.	approximation algorithm;carrier frequency offset;committed information rate;computational complexity theory;interference (communication);numerical analysis;power-line communication;quasiperiodicity;sparse matrix;spectral efficiency	Roee Shaked;Nir Shlezinger;Ron Dabora	2017	2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081331	periodic graph (geometry);statistics;power-line communication;signal processing;computational complexity theory;impulse response;control theory;carrier frequency offset;spectral efficiency;communication channel;mathematics	EDA	50.79279165047885	80.03467215599167	116291

By jointly optimizing the transmitter and the receiver filters of the overlay system, the sum of the mean-squared error MSE of the new system plus the excess MSE in the existing system due to the introduction of the overlay system is minimized. The effects of varying key parameters such as the overlay transmitter power and the amount of overlap between the legacy and the overlay systems are investigated. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the system to accuracy of signal-to-noise ratio SNR estimate and the channel estimate is also examined.		Monirosharieh Vameghestahbanati;Hasan S.

MC-CDMA is being researched as an alternate technology for fourth generation (4G) as well as fifth generation (5G) mobile systems. MAI has been a major concern for the CDMA based systems. MAI increases the bit error rate in a MC-CDMA system, which in turn degrades the system performance. The SIWCA is based on the social impact theory of human behavior in the society. The proposed approach combines the social sciences with the communication technology. The simulation results show that SIWCA based MC-CDMA detector is capable of significantly reducing the MAI and gives a near-optimum performance. Further SIWCA is compared with popular optimization techniques like genetic algorithm (GA) and binary particle swarm optimization (PSO) for different parameters. Simulation results show that SIWCA converges fast and works with lesser number of control parameters as compared to GA and PSO.	bit error rate;channel capacity;computational complexity theory;fifth generation computer;frequency allocation;genetic algorithm;humans;intelligence amplification;intelligent network;interference (communication);location-based service;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;mike lesser;mobile phone;network congestion;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;simulation;social network;software release life cycle;telecommunications network;x.690	Anmol Kumar;Jyoti Saxena;Ritesh Kumar;Rishemjit Kaur	2018	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-018-5791-5	genetic algorithm;computer science;real-time computing;communications system;bit error rate;code division multiple access;algorithm;detector;social impact theory;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;particle swarm optimization	Mobile	46.71122093067073	76.60623848717573	116826

Its superior performance comes however at the price of increased requirements-the knowledge of observation noise power and that of the channel frequency, as well as time correlation functions. In practical transmission scenarios, where channel correlation functions are not known or cannot be easily estimated, it is desirable to have an estimator that is robust to mismatches between the assumed and the actual channel correlation function. While such a robust estimator, for the case of an infinite number of observations, is well known for various uncertainty classes, not much attention has been paid to the practical case of a finite number of observations. We derive in this paper, the maximally robust (MR) 2-D channel estimator for the case of a finite number of pilot observations under some realistic constraints on the uncertainty class to which the 2-D channel correlation sequence belongs. We demonstrate that the correlation sequence associated with the MR estimator can be obtained by a simple semi-definite optimization procedure and is interestingly different from the well-known heuristic proposals. Simulation results establish the superiority of the proposed MR estimator over commonly employed heuristic robust estimator by as much as 3 dB in terms of the worst-case estimation MSE and around 1 dB in terms of the average BER performance under different practical transmission scenarios of interest.	best, worst and average case;channel state information;coefficient;decibel;frequency divider;frequency response;heuristic;least squares;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multiplexing;noise power;requirement;semiconductor industry;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link;x.690	Muhammad Danish Nisar;Wolfgang Utschick;Thomas Hindelang	2010	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2010.2043126	minimax estimator;mathematical optimization;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;least squares;statistics	Mobile	50.04506364584066	76.68126460335492	116836
27fd31c7ad5c201191e7633b779bc8e4947ceb20	an enhanced detection technique of cognitive radio networks	cognitive radio networks;adaptive threshold;sensing failure;energy detector;spectrum sensing;cooperative sensing	There are two types of sensing techniques available for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks (CRNs), signal specific sensing and blind sensing. Blind sensing is more popular because it doesnot require prior informationofprimaryusers (PUs).Conventional-energydetector (C-ED) is one of the examples of blind sensing technique, ease to implement and simplicity are main features of C-ED but at low signal to noise ratio (SNR) its performance degrades. The main factor of performance degradation is sensing failure problem which occurs at low SNR. In this paper, we introduce an improved-energy detector with adaptive double threshold (I-ED-ADT) sensing scheme to overcome sensing failure problem. In this method, each CR makes a local decision in the form of binary bit (0 or 1) when observed energy lies out of the confused region or lies within the confused region. Further, ED-ADT detector uses cooperative sensing where final decision about the presence or absence of PU signal is taken at fusion center (FC) after processing the received decisions. We have carried out MATLAB simulation tool to prove the superiority of the sensing technique in achieving a tradeoff between sensing time and detection performance.	bit error rate;cascading style sheets;cognitive radio;elegant degradation;ibm systems network architecture;matlab;mike lesser;one-class classification;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Ashish Bagwari;Jyotshana Kanti;G.

In this paper, the performance of OFDM-IM is studied in terms of the achievable rate assuming an M-ary constellation and that channel state information is available at the receiver. A closed-form lower bound is derived, based on which an interleaved grouping method is proposed for the use of subcarriers. In comparison with the existing grouping method, the proposed one can better benefit from the diversity effects over frequency-selective fading channels, especially when the spacing of any two subcarriers within a subcarrier group is larger than the coherence bandwidth. Through numerical results, it is revealed that OFDM-IM with interleaved grouping outperforms classical OFDM for small M and certain ranges of signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, the effects of modulation types on the performance of OFDM-IM are studied. It is found that the superiority of OFDM-IM over classical OFDM is greater for phase-shift keying than for quadrature amplitude modulation.	channel state information;frequency divider;internationalization and localization;key (cryptography);mimo-ofdm;modulation;multiplexing;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;subcarrier	Miaowen Wen;Xiang Cheng;Meng Ma;Bingli Jiao;H.

0263081ad7096159195d4833483af383b3f3ae45	uplink pilots for multiuser mimo with mixed grant free and grant based transmissions		Pilot based acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is a challenging problem in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems that allow unscheduled intermittent transmissions from user terminals (UTs). These challenges stem mainly from the need to account for i) possible intra-cell pilot collisions or interference which are characteristic of unscheduled uplink transmissions and ii) the fact that these same pilots are typically also needed for user activity detection at the base station (BS). The problem gets even more challenging in situations with both scheduled (grant based) and unscheduled (grant free) concurrent uplink transmissions because of the fact that grant free and grant based transmissions are typically different in terms of key performance indicators (KPIs). In this article, we present an assignment and multiplexing scheme for uplink pilot sequences from grant free and grant based transmissions that take place on the same time-frequency resources and we numerically assess its performance in terms of both CSI quality and user activity detection probability. The scheme is based on a novel method that can extend any set of state-of-the-art orthogonal pilots to generate a hybrid (orthogonal/non-orthogonal) pilot set with a built-in trade-off between the maximum achievable sum rate for grant based transmissions and the maximum tolerable level of pilot interference for grant free transmissions.	canonical account;channel state information;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;numerical analysis;simulation;telecommunications link	Nassar Ksairi;Mérouane Debbah	2018	2018 IEEE 87th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2018.8417579	computer network;mimo;computer science;throughput;channel state information;telecommunications link;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;multiplexing;interference (wave propagation);base station	Embedded	40.606282232939776	85.56283344116011	117142
7817ae9162ed265a52c52f190edc83517212740f	spectrum sensing and resource allocation for multicarrier cognitive radio systems under interference and power constraints	signal image and speech processing;quantum information technology spintronics	Multicarrier waveforms have been commonly recognized as strong candidates for cognitive radio. In this paper, we study the dynamics of spectrum sensing and spectrum allocation functions in cognitive radio context using very practical signal models for the primary users (PUs), including the effects of power amplifier nonlinearities. We start by sensing the spectrum with energy detection-based wideband multichannel spectrum sensing algorithm and continue by investigating optimal resource allocation methods. Along the way, we examine the effects of spectral regrowth due to the inevitable power amplifier nonlinearities of the PU transmitters. The signal model includes frequency selective block-fading channel models for both secondary and primary transmissions. Filter bank-based wideband spectrum sensing techniques are applied for detecting spectral holes and filter bank-based multicarrier (FBMC) modulation is selected for transmission as an alternative multicarrier waveform to avoid the disadvantage of limited spectral containment of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based multicarrier systems. The optimization technique used for the resource allocation approach considered in this study utilizes the information obtained through spectrum sensing and knowledge of spectrum leakage effects of the underlying waveforms, including a practical power amplifier model for the PU transmitter. This study utilizes a computationally efficient algorithm to maximize the SU link capacity with power and interference constraints. It is seen that the SU transmission capacity depends critically on the spectral containment of the PU waveform, and these effects are quantified in a case study using an 802.11-g WLAN scenario.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;audio power amplifier;cognitive radio;filter bank;frequency allocation;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;modulation;multiplexing;one-class classification;sensor;spectral leakage;transmitter;waveform	Sener Dikmese;Sudharsan Srinivasan;Musbah Shaat;Faouzi Bader;Markku Renfors	2014	EURASIP J.

The proposed scheme is an adaptive nonlinear predictor that consists of an (N+1)-level quantizer, four adders, and two adaptive linear filters, where N is the number of users in the CDMA system. Both adaptive filters have the same coefficients at each iteration: one for feedforward estimation of NBI and the other for feedback compensation for the estimated result. It could be regarded as an improved version of the nonlinear predictor with offset outputs presented recently by Wang et al. (1996). Computer simulation results support that the improved offset predictor performs much better than the original one under the same complexity. As compared with the nearly optimal approximate conditional mean filter, it achieves almost the same performance even at very low signal-to-noise ratio but involves much less complexity.	interference (communication);zero suppression	Chin-Liang Wang;Kuo-Ming Wu	2001	IEEE Trans.

Unfortunately, the conditions, such as, residual carrier frequency offset, time variations because of Doppler shift or phase noise, which thus destroys the orthogonality at the receiver, hence results in intercarrier interference (ICI) and degrades the bit error rate (BER) performance. In this paper, the conjugate cancellation (CC) to mitigate the ICI of OFDM systems is combined with 2×1 and 4×1 space-time (ST) code to form STCC systems. Even though any full orthogonal transmission matrix is not available, the STCC-OFDM systems with four transmit antennas not only significantly improves the BER of non-orthogonality of the transmission matrix, but also provides a higher transmission rate compared the full orthogonal with the coding rate 0.5 transmissions under the same antenna construction. Furthermore, the error floor provided by 4×1 STCC-OFDM systems with coding rate 1 is significantly lower than the regular CC, ST, and 4×1 ST-OFDM with coding rate 0.5. This STCC-OFDM system may serve as the needed function for the fifth generation (5G) in the multiple-input and multiple-output MIMO-OFDM systems without increasing power, bandwidth, and the computational load.	bit error rate;carrier frequency offset;catastrophic interference;doppler effect;error floor;fifth generation computer;frequency divider;ici (programming language);interference (communication);mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;phase noise;residual carrier;subcarrier;x.690	Hen-Geul Yeh;Samet Yildiz	2016	2016 Annual IEEE Systems Conference (SysCon)	10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490635	electronic engineering;telecommunications;communication	Embedded	47.460503875877755	79.98629074576162	117449

However, these new technologies can also deteriorate the receivers' bit-error rate (BER) performance. By bringing the concept of BER-awareness into network planning, we can alleviate the performance deterioration, which could in turn lead to simpler design of receiver and thus lower the total cost of LR-PON.#R##N##R##N#The effects of AWG and EDFA on BER are studied in this paper. An analytical model of BER performance is developed as a function of the output port location in the AWG and the distance of the receiver from the AWG. Not only does the proposed model capture the power loss caused by AWG, but it also accounts for several transmission impairments, including the beat noise due to inter-channel crosstalk in the AWG, the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise related to EDFA, and the thermal noise related to the receiver. Based on this model, we propose both short-term and long-term distance-aware wavelength allocation schemes, which balance the BER among the optical network units (ONUs) at different distance. Simulation results show that average BER improves and the relative standard deviation decreases.	passive optical network;x.690	Lei Shi;Avishek Nag;Debasish Datta;Biswanath Mukherjee	2013	Optical Switching and Networking	10.1016/j.osn.2013.03.002	bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;wavelength-division multiplexing	Robotics	40.93136886391578	79.94528014329214	117480

Since long delay spreads in UWB channels cause significant intersymbol interference, DS-UWB systems require equalization. In this second part of two papers, we investigate equalization for DS-UWB with 4-ary biorthogonal keying (4BOK), which is one of the two modulation formats that was proposed for standardization by the IEEE 802.15.3a task group. To this end, we first derive expressions for the bit error rate (BER) according to the matched-filter bound for 4BOK DS-UWB, which serve as theoretical performance limits for equalization. We then devise structures and methods for filter optimization for low-complexity linear and nonlinear equalization schemes. In this context, we develop a new equivalent multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) description of 4BOK DS-UWB, which facilitates the design of efficient equalizers using MIMO filter optimization techniques. Furthermore, we propose the application of widely linear processing to these equalizers. Simulation and semianalytical results show that MIMO equalization is greatly advantageous over more obvious non-MIMO schemes and that the proposed MIMO equalizers allow for power-efficient 4BOK DS-UWB transmission close to the theoretical limits with moderate computational complexity.	amplitude-shift keying;bit error rate;computational complexity theory;equalization (communications);feedforward neural network;interference (communication);key (cryptography);mimo;mimo-ofdm;matched filter;mathematical optimization;modulation;nonlinear system;rake;simulation;ultra-wideband;x.690	Ambuj Parihar;Lutz H.-J.

A simple and closed-form expression for the pairwise error probability (PEP) is provided. Based on the obtained PEP, a closed-form upper bound expression for the average bit error probability (BEP) is obtained. The obtained results clearly show the effect of the fading parameters on the average BEP. In case of the α-μ fading channels, increasing a has larger negative impact on the average BEP compared to increasing μ. In addition, the results demonstrate that the correlation coefficient of the transmit-antennas significantly deteriorates the average BEP when compared to the correlation coefficient of the receive-antennas.	bit error rate;coefficient;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;pairwise error probability;rayleigh fading	Osamah S.

The laser PN and the NLPN at high launch powers degrade system performance severely. In this letter, we investigate the use of Kalman filter (KF) to estimate and track both the laser PN and the NLPN in 100-Gb/s single channel coherent optical phase-modulated systems. Initially, the KF is operated in the training mode with pilot symbols; the filter is switched to decision directed mode after training. Simulation results for single-polarization, 100-Gb/s QPSK transmission over 20 × 80 km fiber with in-line dispersion compensation show that KF can successfully mitigate NLPN at 8-dBm launch power with 1-MHz laser linewidth. Comparison with digital backpropagation algorithm (one step/span) shows that KF provides 6-dB improvement in Q-factor. Kalman estimates corresponding to the time evolution of PN and NLPN are also provided, which shows optimal tracking of both the noise processes, thereby validating our proposed scheme.	algorithm;backpropagation;coherent;data rate units;dbm;kalman filter;modulation;nonlinear system;phase noise;polarization (waves);simulation;transmitter	Ankita Jain;Pradeep Kumar Krishnamurthy	2016	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2550429	kalman filter;nonlinear optics;dispersion;telecommunications;phase-shift keying;control theory;q factor;phase noise	Robotics	51.963589040831685	76.91074492351615	117654

In particular, there are emerging UAV applications such as aerial photograph and data relaying that require high-speed communications between the UAVs and the ground base stations (GBSs). Due to the high UAV altitude, the strong line-of-sight (LoS) links generally dominate the channels between the UAVs and GBSs, which brings both opportunities and challenges in the design of future wireless networks supporting both terrestrial and aerial users. Although each UAV can associate with more GBSs for communication as compared to terrestrial users thanks to the LoS-dominant channels, it also causes/suffers more severe interference to/from the terrestrial communications in the uplink/downlink. This paper studies the uplink communication from a multi-antenna UAV to a set of GBSs within its signal coverage by considering a practical yet challenging scenario when the number of antennas at the UAV is smaller than that of co-channel GBSs. To achieve highrate transmission yet avoid interfering with any of the existing terrestrial communications at the co-channel GBSs, we propose a novel multi-beam transmission strategy by exploiting the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique. Specifically, the UAV sends each data stream to a selected subset of the GBSs, which can decode the UAV’s signals and then cancel them before decoding the messages of their served terrestrial users, and in the meanwhile nulls its interference at the other GBSs via zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming. To draw essential insight, we first characterize in closed-form the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) achievable for the UAV’s sum-rate maximization under the proposed strategy. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to jointly optimize the number of UAV data streams, the data streamGBS association, and the transmit beamforming to maximize the UAV’s transmit rate subject to the interference avoidance constraints for protecting the terrestrial users. Numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed NOMAbased multi-beam transmission strategy.	aerial photography;beamforming;expectation–maximization algorithm;fifth generation computer;interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);telecommunications link;television antenna;terrestrial television;unmanned aerial vehicle;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Liang Liu;Shuowen Zhang;Rui Zhang	2018	CoRR		wireless network;data stream;mathematical optimization;telecommunications link;computer network;interference (wave propagation);mathematics;beamforming;cellular network;base station;communication channel	Mobile	40.259656519327436	87.01592491534208	117885

Specifically, IEEE 802.11a systems which operate around 5 GHz and overlap the band of UWB signals will interfere with UWB systems significantly. In this paper, a novel narrow-band interferences (NBI) suppression technique based on singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm for a direct sequence ultra-wideband (DS-UWB) communication system is presented. SVD is used to approximate the interferences which then are subtracted from the received signals. The proposed technique is simple and robust. Simulation results show that the proposed new technique is very effective.	algorithm;interference (communication);singular value decomposition;zero suppression	Shaoyi Xu;Zhiquan Bai;Qinghai Yang;Kyung Sup Kwak	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e89-a.7.1913	telecommunications;electrical engineering;mathematics;singular value decomposition;algebra	Visualization	48.52957565516179	80.9457109776002	117940
c94bd3f0916520a40c63125fe0238157e206164e	enhanced channel estimation and codebook design for millimeter-wave communication		The existing channel estimation methods for millimeter-wave communications, e.g., hierarchical search and compressed sensing, either acquire only one single multipath component (MPC) or require considerably high training overhead. To realize fast yet accurate channel estimation, we propose a multipath decomposition and recovery approach in this paper. The proposed approach has two stages. In the first stage, instead of directly searching the real MPCs, we decompose each real MPC into several virtual MPCs and acquire the virtual MPCs by using the hierarchical search based on a normal-resolution codebook. Then, in the second stage, the real MPCs are recovered from the acquired virtual MPCs in the first stage, which turns out to be a sparse reconstruction problem, where the size of the dictionary matrix is greatly reduced by exploiting the results of the virtual multipath acquisition. Moreover, to make the proposed approach applicable for both analog and hybrid beamforming/combining devices with strict constant-modulus constraint, we particularly design a codebook for the hierarchical search by using an enhanced subarray technique, and the codebook is also applicable in other hierarchical search methods. Performance comparisons show that the proposed approach achieves a superior tradeoff between estimation performance and training penalty over the state-of-the-art alternatives.	beamforming;channel state information;codebook;compressed sensing;dictionary;modulus of continuity;multipath propagation;overhead (computing);reconstruction conjecture;sparse matrix	Zhenyu Xiao;Hang Dong;Lin Bai;Pengfei Xia;Xiang-Gen Xia	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2854369	multipath propagation;computer science;compressed sensing;electronic engineering;codebook;real-time computing;extremely high frequency;beamforming;matrix (mathematics);communication channel	Vision	43.82724903671013	86.49433676202125	118038

However, its performance degrades significantly while multiple access interference (MAI) is present. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity adaptive filtering scheme to solve the problem. The proposed scheme comprises two adaptive filters, an adaptive spatial and an adaptive temporal filter. With a special structure, the spatial filter can act as a beamformer suppressing interference, while the temporal filter can act as a code-delay estimator. A criterion is proposed for minimization such that these filters can simultaneously adjusted by a constrained least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm. The proposed system is simple and it can acquire both the code-delay and direction-of-arrival (DoA) of the desired user. The performance as well as the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Closed-form expressions for optimum filters and steady-state mean-squared errors (MSE) are derived.

This detection method is used for determining the presence or absence of primary users in cognitive radio networks based on the eigenvalues of the cyclic covariance matrix of received signals. In particular, the cyclic correlation significance test is used to detect a specific signal-of-interest by exploiting knowledge of its cyclic frequencies. Analytical asymptotic expressions for the probability of detection and probability of false-alarm under both spatially uncorrelated and spatially correlated noise are derived and verified by simulations. The detection performance in a Rayleigh flat-fading environment is found and verified through simulations. One of the advantages of the proposed method is that the detection threshold is shown to be independent of both the number of samples and the noise covariance, effectively eliminating the dependence on accurate noise estimation. The proposed method is also shown to provide higher detection probability and better robustness to noise uncertainty than existing multiple antenna cyclostationary-based spectrum sensing algorithms under both AWGN as well as a quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;cognitive radio;cyclostationary process;mimo;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation	Paulo Urriza;Eric Rebeiz;Danijela Cabric	2013	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2013.131118	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;radio receiver;statistics;detection theory;computer network	Mobile	49.383933220927155	86.16349398384943	118049

An algorithm based on the cross-correlation property of fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) is proposed to generate a new timing metric. In this algorithm, cross correlation of received signal and Z–Chu sequence is taken at the receiver side in FRFT domain. The mathematical analysis of proposed estimator has been done and the variance of timing metric is obtained under the effect of AWGN channel. The simulation result shows that the variance of timing metric decreases as signal to noise ratio increases. The mean and MSE of the timing offset is simulated under HYPERLAN indoor channel (type-A). The proposed estimation method has been compared with existing methods and established as a better method to combat timing offset.

We present a synchronisation technique, operative in a navigation receiver under multipath interference, that takes into account its special conditions: low signal-to-noise ratio, DS-CDMA signals with long spreading codes, and very low data rates. The paper begins introducing the signal model of a deterministic antenna array. In this context, the system-specific features translate into the assumtion that all times of arrival must be inside a delay interval in which a truncated series approximation of the reference signal is valid. The introduction of this series in the signal model leads to an implementation based on a bank of correlators. Finally, the associated minimization problem is solved using three minimization algorithms: ESPRIT, IQML and a modification of Newton’s Method. The latter calculates the maximum Likelihood estimator with a low computational burden.	algorithm;approximation;catastrophic interference;code;elegant degradation;interference (communication);newton;newton's method;signal-to-noise ratio	Jesus Selva	2001		10.1109/ICASSP.2001.940436	telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics;rake receiver	Mobile	51.22764140790697	76.90253981372199	118359

This method was based on the estimation of the probability density function (pdf) of soft observed samples. The kernel method was used for the pdf estimation. In this paper, we suggest to use a Gaussian Mixture (GM) model. The Expectation Maximisation algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of this mixture. The optimal number of Gaussians is computed by using Mutual Information Theory. The analytical expression of the BER is therefore simply given by using the different estimated parameters of the Gaussian Mixture. Simulation results are presented to compare the three mentioned methods: Monte Carlo, Kernel and Gaussian Mixture. We analyze the performance of the proposed BER estimator in the framework of a multiuser code division multiple access system and show that attractive performance is achieved compared with conventional MC or Kernel aided techniques. The results show that the GM method can drastically reduce the needed number of samples to estimate the BER in order to reduce the required simulation run-time, even at very low BER.	bit error rate;expectation–maximization algorithm;information theory;kernel (operating system);kernel method;monte carlo method;multi-user;mutual information;portable document format;simulation;x.690	Samir Saoudi;Thomas Derham;Tarik Ait-Idir;Patrice Coupé	2010	EURASIP J.

We also introduce a pilot and control cancellation scheme for practical consideration in MIMO-CDMA.

Due to loopback channel estimation error and limitation of analog-to-digital converter, the loopback SI cannot be completely canceled. Multiple antennas at the relay can help loopback SI suppression, but beamforming is required to balance between the residual SI suppression and the desired signal transmission. Moreover, the relay beamforming matrix should be updated every time slot, because the residual SI in the previous time slot is amplified by the current beamforming matrix and added to the received signals from the two sources in the current time slot. We derive the optimally balanced relay beamforming and receive beamforming matrices in closed form based on minimum MSE, taking into account the propagation of the residual loopback SI from the first to the current time slot. We also propose beamforming design using only the channels of the $m$ latest time slots, not from the first time slot. Based on our numerical results, we also identify when FD is beneficial and propose selection between FD and half-duplex according to signal-to-noise ratio and interference-to-noise ratio.	analog-to-digital converter;beamforming;channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);loopback;mimo;mean squared error;numerical analysis;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;zero suppression	Yeonggyu Shim;Wan Choi;Hyuncheol Park	2016	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2016.2587768	telecommunications;antenna;silicon;relay channel	Mobile	39.29954272776597	88.28633358799355	118441

To reduce the number of outages resulting from the noise amplification by the zero-forcing (ZF) within the successive interference cancellation (SIC) procedure, the AP is given the possibility to request a selected number of sensors to retransmit their signals in a subsequent time slot. If necessary the AP suspends the ZF-SIC until the requested signals have been retransmitted, making the signal recovery a recursive procedure. The number of sensors required to retransmit depends on the order of the processed sensor signals within the ZF-SIC. We propose two algorithms for determining the decoding order: an algorithm which finds a decoding order necessitating a minimal number of retransmissions, and a suboptimal alternative algorithm with significantly lower complexity. By numerical means the performance and complexities of the considered algorithms are analyzed.	algorithm;blast;bell laboratories layered space-time;brute-force search;computer performance;decoding methods;detection theory;heuristic;interference (communication);numerical analysis;recursion;retransmission (data networks);search algorithm;sensor web;simplified instructional computer;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;transmitter;wireless access point;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Marc Selig;Thomas Hunziker;Dirk Dahlhaus	2011	2011 IEEE 73rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2011.5956568	electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;computer network	Mobile	45.78742748783713	86.76083433550883	118535

Our work is motivated by some emerging broad-band access standards which require a receiver that can first blindly start up, then blindly distinguish between CAP and QAM, and finally decode the signal. The “brute force” solution to this problem would be to implement CAP and QAM receivers in parallel. However, we propose a single novel receiver based on a single equalizer that accommodates both line codes, yielding significant computational savings. We describe the receiver architecture, blind start-up methods, and line code identification algorithms, as well as computer simulations and a laboratory experiment to verify the theoretical receiver behavior.	algorithm;blind equalization;brute-force search;computer simulation;equalization (communications);line code;pulse-width modulation;the legend of zelda: the minish cap	Lee M.

At each layer of detection, a group of best data streams are selected to be equalized and reliably detected via removing the phase and amplitude distortion caused by the multiple CFOs. The estimated phase rotations and amplitude scalars are required to be compensated to the detected data streams in order to reconstruct the interference signals which are canceled out from the received signals. Instead of direct estimation of CFOs, our algorithm is to estimate the phase rotations and amplitude scalars in a group-wise fashion, which dramatically reduces the computational complexity at receiver. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LFDE with phase compensation architecture can provide good performance for a MIMO system impaired by CFOs over unbalanced multi-path channels with long delay spread. We also show that the performance will be improved if more layers are used at receivers.	algorithm;carrier frequency;catastrophic interference;computational complexity theory;distortion;global communications conference;interference (communication);mimo;mimo-ofdm;simulation;subject matter expert turing test;unbalanced circuit	Jian Zhang;Yahong Rosa Zheng	2009	GLOBECOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5426087	receiver;telecommunications;computer science;phase-shift keying;control theory;interference;radio receiver;computational complexity theory;frequency domain;statistics;mimo;broadband networks	HPC	50.96721483362197	79.16496134216726	118917

However, TDS-OFDM suffers from reduced energy efficiency and performance loss due to the existing mutual inferences. In this paper, based on the newly emerging theory of structured compressive sensing (SCS), we propose a reliable and energy-efficient TDS-OFDM transmission scheme with reduced guard interval power (which is impossible for CP-OFDM) by designing a channel estimation scheme with high accuracy. The wireless channel properties including channel sparsity and inter-channel correlation, which are usually not considered in conventional OFDM schemes, have been exploited. We further exploit the worst-case system design principle to extract multiple interference-free regions of small size to simultaneously reconstruct multiple channels of large size without iterative interference cancellation. In this way, the guard interval power in TDS-OFDM can be reduced to achieve a 20% higher energy efficiency than standard CP-OFDM, and the system reliability can be also improved in fast fading channels.	best, worst and average case;channel state information;compressed sensing;computational complexity theory;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;mimo-ofdm;simulation;sparse matrix;spectral efficiency;systems design	Linglong Dai;Zhaocheng Wang;Zhixing Yang;Guan Gui;Fumiyuki Adachi	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6883940	channel allocation schemes;real-time computing;telecommunications	Mobile	49.951049508467975	80.81709609069135	119022

However, multiple RF chains connected to multiple antennas are usually more expensive and complex than antenna elements themselves. Selective space-time coding and selection diversity can be viewed as practical means to reduce the implementation complexity of MIMO systems while still taking benefit of the use of multiple antennas. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of selective space-time block coding and antenna selection diversity and analyze the performance of both schemes under perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) available at both ends of the transmission link. Our performance analysis reveals that, under perfect CSI, selective space-time coding diversity yields a loss in selection diversity gains when combined with space-time coding, and that selecting just a single antenna at the transmitter side to transmit data is the best strategy in this CSI case of operation. We also show that selection diversity still outperforms selective space-time coding diversity when the channel estimation is imperfect	channel state information;mimo;profiling (computer programming);quality of service;radio frequency;spectral efficiency;transmitter	Ya-Han Pan;Sonia Aïssa	2005	2005 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2005.1651867	antenna diversity;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;cooperative diversity;statistics	Mobile	42.172259957977005	81.26990582272384	119075

In this paper, in order to suppress spectral sidelobes, we propose a novel windowing scheme. The derivation of the optimum window function is based on the solution of an optimization problem. It aims to minimize in-band-out-of-subband (IBOSB) power radiation. An algorithm named GSSO is designed to approximate the optimum window function. The simulation results show that with a lower roll-off factor (2.5%) the proposed windowing scheme can significantly improve the performance of spectral sidelobes suppression.	approximation algorithm;frequency divider;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multiplexing;optimization problem;roll-off;simulation;window function;zero suppression	Lei Wang;Renhui Xu;Laixian Peng	2017	2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170964	computer science;real-time computing;approximation algorithm;radiation;algorithm design;window function;interference (wave propagation);orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;electronic engineering;optimization problem	EDA	48.88777556552677	81.71386872426305	119132

In particular, analog and hybrid beamforming solutions are receiving increasing attention as less expensive and more power efficient alternatives to fully digital precoding schemes. Despite their proven good performance in simple setups, their suitability for realistic cellular systems with many interfering base stations and users is still unclear. Furthermore, the performance of massive MIMO beamforming and precoding methods are in practice also affected by practical limitations and hardware constraints. In this sense, this paper assesses the performance of digital precoding and analog beamforming in an urban cellular system with an accurate mmW channel model under both ideal and realistic assumptions. The results show that analog beamforming can reach the performance of fully digital maximum ratio transmission under line of sight conditions and with a sufficient number of parallel radio-frequency (RF) chains, especially when the practical limitations of outdated channel information and per antenna power constraints are considered. This work also shows the impact of the phase shifter errors and combiner losses introduced by real phase shifter and combiner implementations over analog beamforming, where the former ones have minor impact on the performance, while the latter ones determine the optimum number of RF chains to be used in practice.	analog;antenna device component;articulation disorders;bands;beamforming;channel (communications);diplexer;emergency medical service communication systems;fifth generation computer;frequency band;hearing loss, high-frequency;mimo;performance evaluation;post-ictal memory loss;radio frequency;shifter device component;solutions;uncompressed video;millimeter	Sonia Gimenez;Sandra Roger;Paolo Baracca;David Martín-Sacristán;Jose F.

WFMT modulation scheme is based on the wavelet theory and complex filter banks for synthesis and analysis of multi-channel signal. WFMT modulation scheme keeps on the advantage of filter banks system and decreases the system complexity and can be easily possible for the implementation of filter banks. In this paper, we compare ISI (inter symbol interference) and ICI distortions of the WFMT and vehicular OFDM system due to the CFO (carrier frequency offset) and phase noise. And we analyze the PAPR performance of these systems and show the BER performance curve in the HPA and ICI situation owing to the Doppler frequency shift and the frequency offset. Also, the performance of WFMT system versus vehicular OFDM is calculated to find the SNR degradation on DMT (discrete multitone)/OFDM and WFMT system with number of FFT points in the presence of ICI, ISI, phase noise, PAPR and Doppler Effect. In the simulation results, the PAPR performance of WFMT system becomes worse because of characteristic of wavelet component coefficients.	carrier frequency offset;coefficient;delta modulation;digital monetary trust;distortion;doppler effect;elegant degradation;fast fourier transform;filter bank;ici (programming language);information sciences institute;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;phase noise;power architecture platform reference;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;wavelet;x.690;zero suppression	Junyeong Bok;Seon-Ae Kim;Heung-Gyoon Ryu	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364746	speech recognition;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;doppler effect;telecommunications;computer science;phase noise;intersymbol interference;wavelet transform	EDA	47.99960615299716	81.1868521500314	119356

However, PTS technique requires an exhaustive search over all combinations of allowed phase weighting factors, and the search complexity increases exponentially with the number of sub-blocks in OFDM system. Hence, there has been a trade-off between performance PAPR reduction and computational complexity in PTS OFDM system. The proposed is a sub-optimum PTS for PAPR reduction of OFDM system. Simulation results demonstrate that the superiority of evolutionary computation technique-particle swarm optimization (PSO) based on PTS which can be utilized for finding the optimum phase weighting factors, and can achieve the lower PAPR and computational complexity of OFDM systems. In addition, our evolutionary computation technique can be used to reduce reduction PAPR with comparable performance to genetic algorithm-based PTS, with much less computation cost. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

ccfecba0a793eb6c5427dd6a69a8b000b7990035	time diversity in multipath channels for cellular iot: theoretical and simulation analysis		The Internet of Things (IoT), describing the Machine Type Communications (MTC), is in the center of many new technical studies and industrial projects. It is also a central topic for the future 5G technologies standardization. Pending the new generation of cellular networks, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has already standardized in May 2016, an evolution of the 2G and 4G networks to include IoT features. EC-GSM-IoT, the standard for the 2G technologies including the MTC, uses several technical evolutions to obtain a 20 dB improvement of the legacy Maximum Coupling Loss (MCL) of GPRS. One of them is the use of blind repetitions, and of combination techniques in the receiver. In a previous work [1], the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of several time diversity combining mechanisms in a classical GSM receiver were studied in simulation. The present paper focuses on two of these combination techniques and leads a novel analytical study of their performances under a time variant multipath Rayleigh fading channel. The impact of the time correlation of the channels on the average Signal to Noise and Interference Ratio (SINR) is enlightened. Simulation results are compared to the theoretical curves and confirm the analytical work. This analytical investigation allows us to foresee the consequences on the final BER of the system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analytical study of the performance of such time diversity combining mechanisms under time variant multipath Rayleigh fading channels.	bit error rate;coupling loss;interference (communication);internet of things;macintosh common lisp;multipath propagation;performance;rayleigh fading;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;x.690	Louis-Adrien Dufrene;Matthieu Crussière;Jean-François Hélard;Jean Schwoerer	2017	2017 IEEE 13th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)	10.1109/WiMOB.2017.8115751	multipath propagation;general packet radio service;time diversity;bit error rate;standardization;theoretical computer science;rayleigh fading;computer science;cellular network;communication channel	Metrics	43.837615859654	82.11980920562249	119497
74c722f23a6987fa73bf74f489ae61402fc827d8	measurement based evaluation of interference alignment on the vienna mimo testbed		Most modern wireless multi-user networks suffer from undesired interference that impairs the data transmission over the individual radio links. In order to maximize the data throughput in such systems, several interference mitigation schemes have been investigated recently. Interference alignment stands out as one of the most promising ones, able to attain the maximum data throughput over interference disturbed links in theory, given the right conditions. As the theoretical research progresses, practical implementations have to be considered in order to confirm the theory and discover limitations introduced by hardware. Interference alignment utilizes linear filtering at each transmitter and receiver of the network. The transmit filters thereby partition the signal space at the receiver into two subspaces, a desired signal subspace containing the signal from the desired transmitter and an interference subspace accumulating all the interfering signals. The aligned interference is then forced to zero by the receive filter and only the desired signal is retained. For this to be accomplished, cooperation of all users in the network is required. This work first deals with the theoretical foundations of interference alignment by introducing the relevant system model and discussing feasibility and filter computation. It then advances to the characterization of the Vienna MIMO testbed on which interference alignment was implemented throughout this work. The testbed employs two outdoor transmitters on rooftops, one indoor transmitter and one indoor receiver. The radio channels in the considered setup are quasi-static. Hardware, software and the used signals are described. Performance measures for evaluation are introduced. Finally, measurement results are presented. The feasibility of interference alignment is shown, and the performance measures are evaluated over variable signal to noise ratio and variable signal to interference ratio. The results are discussed, and impairments introduced by hardware are highlighted.	computation;interference (communication);mimo;mimo-ofdm;multi-user;signal subspace;signal-to-noise ratio;testbed;throughput;transmitter;vienna development method	Martin Mayer;Gerald Artner;Gabor Hannak;Martin Lerch;Maxime Guillaud	2013			simulation;telecommunications	Networks	41.94086088171583	86.01798809595897	119719

For very high-speed and high-quality packet transmissions in a limited bandwidth, the joint use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiplexing and hybrid ARQ (HARQ) is an effective method. However, if single-carrier (SC) transmission is used, the transmission performance significantly degrades due to a large inter-symbol interference (ISI) resulting from a severe frequency-selective fading. In this paper, we propose an iterative frequency-domain successive interference cancellation (SIC) with two dimensional (2D) MMSE-FDE. At each iteration stage, the successive signal detection/cancellation is performed according to the descending order of the signal reliability. However, since the interference from the other transmit antennas can be only partially cancelled by performing SIC, the residual interference is present at the output of SIC. In this paper, we propose to update the 2D MMSE-FDE weights at each signal detection in order to suppress simultaneously the ISI and the interference from other antennas while obtaining antenna and frequency diversity gain. However, since a single use of SIC with 2D MMSE-FDE is insufficient, it is repeated a sufficient number of times. The bit error rate (BER) and HARQ throughput performance in a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel are evaluated by computer simulation.	adobe framemaker;bell laboratories layered space-time;bit error rate;computer simulation;detection theory;eb/n0;effective method;hybrid automatic repeat request;information sciences institute;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;network packet;next-generation network;rayleigh fading;simplified instructional computer;sorting;throughput;x.690	Akinori Nakajima;Fumiyuki Adachi	2006	IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VTCF.2006.351	computer simulation;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;frequency domain;statistics;computer network	Mobile	47.568723754090364	78.95382760090061	119774

However, the severe path loss needs to be compensated by extracting the channel state information (CSI) for beamforming gain. The CSI can be obtained by channel tracking in time-varying channel environment. In this paper, we present a two-stage channel tracking algorithm for time-varying channel of URAs in mmWave massive MIMO systems. The two-stage channel tracking algorithm focuses on obtaining accurate CSI. Firstly, the azimuth and elevation angles are easily estimated based on extending Kalman Filter to obtain the physical channel matrix. Then, the matrix factorization $(\mathrm{M}\Gamma)$ algorithm is proposed to calibrate the channel, which decrease the estimation error caused by EKF. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed algorithm. The proposed channel tracking algorithm can reduce the symbol error rates and increase the tracking time compared with traditional channel tracking algorithms.	algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;data rate units;extended kalman filter;linear approximation;mimo;simulation;the matrix	Haiyan Liu;Tiankui Zhang;Zhirui Hu;Jonathan Loo;Youxiang Wang	2018	2018 10th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2018.8555585	elevation;channel state information;real-time computing;mimo;path loss;kalman filter;computer science;beamforming;extended kalman filter;control theory;communication channel	Mobile	44.468626904194494	85.58653504824335	119844

First, we analyze the achievable sum rate lower-bound using the Bussgang decomposition under new assumptions. In the presence of the non-linear quantization, our analysis indicates the potential merit of reconsidering traditional signal processing techniques in coarsely quantized systems, i.e., reconsidering transmit covariance matrices whose rank is equal to the rank of the channel. Furthermore, in the latter part of this paper, we propose a linear precoder design that achieves the predicted increase in performance compared with a state-of-the-art linear precoder design. Moreover, our linear signal processing algorithm allows for higher order modulation schemes to be employed.		Oliver De Candido;Hela Jedda;Amine Mezghani;A. Lee Swindlehurst;Josef A.

As previously demonstrated for no latency with a fixed update rate, the SMSE waveform design process can exploit statistical knowledge of PU spectral and temporal behavior to maximize SMSE system throughput (bits/second) while adhering to SMSE and PU bit error rate constraints with mutual coexistent interference limited to manageable levels. Building upon this previous work, a sensitivity analysis is conducted here through parametric variation in both waveform update latency and update rate. Relative to a spectrally-only adapted waveform, the spectrally-temporally adapted waveform provides significant performance improvement. Maximum improvement is achieved using statistic-based prediction of channel temporal conditions and appropriate updating of the SMSE waveform design.	bit error rate;heart rate variability;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);modulation;one-class classification;subcarrier;throughput;waveform	Eric C.

The key idea of the proposed scheme is to joint channel estimation, noise plus interference power estimation and decoding together to enhance both the estimation accuracy and bit error ration (BER) performance. We derive the Cramér-Rao Bounds (CRB) for mean square errors of channel estimation and noise plus interference estimations, and the CRBs can be achieved via the proposed scheme with very few iteration numbers, hence, the complexity of the proposed scheme is very low. Moreover, simulation results show that the decoding performance of the proposed scheme substantially approaches to that of the maximum likelihood decoder with perfect channel estimation and full knowledge of interference distribution.	bit error rate;channel state information;decoding methods;frequency divider;interference (communication);iteration;mean squared error;multiplexing;simulation;x.690	Youwen Yi;Daiming Qu;Tao Jiang;Guangxi Zhu;Yejun He	2010		10.1145/1815396.1815620	cramér–rao bound;telecommunications;zero-forcing precoding;statistics	Mobile	49.07930033422792	77.25893951936317	120363

It is revealed that the conventional DA ML estimate is a special case of the novel DA ML estimate, and both the proposed DA ML and the proposed blind ML SNR estimation techniques can offer satisfactory SNR estimation without introducing significant additional complexity to the existing hybrid ARQ scheme. Based on the AONSS, both the generalized deterministic and the random Cramer-Rao lower bounds (GCRLBs), which include the traditional Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) as special cases, are also derived.

A novel blind technique is proposed based on the pseudo-rotation of the M-QAM constellation. The pseudo-rotation based compensator is a generic approach, because it does not depend on the modulation order and the level of imbalance. To implement the proposed compensation in practical systems, two algorithms are proposed: Recursive Pseudo-Rotation (RPR) that achieves the performance of the ideal compensator and LRPR, a Low complexity version of RPR. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the proposed compensator outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and the complexity/performance trade-off is also discussed. The efficiency of the proposed method is experimentally validated with a 10 Gbaud QPSK optical system showing its operation in the presence of Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI).	additive model;additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;babinet–soleil compensator;coherent;experiment;in-phase and quadrature components;information sciences institute;interference (communication);modulation;monte carlo method;phase noise;recursion (computer science);resilient packet ring;simulation;testbed;transmitter	Ti Nguyen-Ti;Matthieu Gautier;Pascal Scalart;Olivier Berder;Trung-Hien Nguyen;Fayçal Ait Aoudia	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841633	nonlinear optics;telecommunications;control theory	EDA	51.0560609482771	79.33464746547298	120483
41c0d915d74917378f48ff138294bfdb12c6691d	multiuser millimeter wave mimo channel estimation with hybrid beamforming		This paper focuses on multiuser MIMO channel estimation and data transmission at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies. The proposed approach relies on the time-divisionduplex (TDD) protocol and is based on two distinct phases. First of all, the Base Station (BS) sends a suitable probing signal so that all the Mobile Stations (MSs), using a subspace tracking algorithm, can estimate the dominant left singular vectors of their BS-to-MS propagation channel. Then, each MS, using the estimated dominant left singular vectors as precoding beamformers, sends a suitable pilot sequence so that the BS can estimate the corresponding right dominant channel singular vectors and the corresponding eigenvalues. The lowcomplexity projection approximation subspace tracking with deflation (PASTd) algorithm is used at the MSs for dominant subspace estimation, while pilot-matched (PM) and zero-forcing (ZF) reception is used at the BS. The proposed algorithms can be used in conjuction with an analog RF beamformer and are shown to exhibit very good performance.	algorithm;approximation;beamforming;channel state information;mimo-ofdm;matched filter;multi-user mimo;radio frequency;singular value decomposition;software propagation;test-driven development;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Stefano Buzzi;Carmen D'Andrea	2017	CoRR		3g mimo;precoding;mimo	Mobile	51.86532817174256	80.2895523512251	120716
90e51f939a10b377c8f0f4cae001c308851acab5	scalable non-orthogonal pilot design for massive mimo systems with massive connectivity		With the growing need for Internet of things (IoT) applications, wireless communications are facing the challenge of providing massive connectivity. However, as the number of users increases, the capacity of massive MIMO systems will be severely affected due to the huge channel estimation overhead. Therefore it is necessary to introduce non-orthogonal pilots to massive MIMO systems in order to ease the burden on the resources for channel estimation. In this paper, we propose a KKT-basediterativenon-orthogonalpilotdesignalgorithmwhich maximizes the mutual information between the received signal and the channel for MMSE channel estimation. For the typical antenna deployment of uniform linear array (ULA), we also provide scalable estimation schemes with low complexity based onchannelangularrepresentationasalternatives.Thesimulation results show that our schemes signi&#64257;cantly save the estimation overhead at the cost of slight decrease in the MSE performance of the channel estimation, and the saving is even more prominent when the system accommodates more users.	angularjs;centralized computing;channel state information;graph coloring;greedy algorithm;greedy coloring;internet of things;iterative method;multi-user mimo;mutual information;overhead (computing);scalability;scalable cluster environment;simulation;software deployment	Ruichen Deng;Sheng Zhou;Zhisheng Niu	2016	2016 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2016.7849035	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications	Mobile	44.6953680879433	86.48108507625174	120990

Hence high data rate is achieved without sacrificing signal energy captured. We derive the higher order moments of multiple access interference (MAI) and fit the distribution of MAI using a generalized Gaussian distribution. Numerical results are provided to show that generalized Gaussian distribution is a more appropriate model for the distribution of MAI. Next, accurate BER formula is derived using the characteristic function (CF) method. Numerical results show that the HDR Prerake DS UWB system outperforms the conventional partial-prerake DS UWB system.	characteristic function (convex analysis);data rate units;ici (programming language);intelligence amplification;interference (communication);numerical method;simulation;software release life cycle;ultra-wideband;x.690	Wei Cao;Arumugam Nallanathan;Chin Choy Chai	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.718	normal distribution;chip;real-time computing;characteristic function;higher-order logic;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;generalized normal distribution;statistics	HPC	48.95425968505841	82.3314052746215	121029

In order to formulate the net SISO-SFN gain (SISO-SFNG), we derive the average signal to noise ratio, where the SFN gain is calculated by the aggregate power sum as a function of the power imbalance, whereas the SFN loss is calculated by a two-term exponential model from a curve fitting as a function of the erasure probability, modulation order, and code rate. The accuracy and effectiveness of the derived formula are verified by comparing the measurement results with the analytical results. The derived formula helps to rationalize why the net gain is positive or negative under a given condition, e.g., a negative net gain is obtained if the power imbalance exceeds the erasure-free limit. The formula would be very useful to predict more realistic and accurate service coverage of SISO-SFN for various system configurations.	aggregate data;code rate;curve fitting;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation interoperability standards organization;single-frequency network;soft-in soft-out decoder;time complexity	Sungho Jeon;Junghyun Kim;Jae-Shin Han;Jong-Soo Seo	2015	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2015.2400812	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering	Mobile	40.500101736455456	79.10914367382456	121040

The proposed radiators are optimized in terms of unhindered EMC function, even when other vehicle electronic systems are involved. Moreover, to attain reliable designs, a generalized explicit method of scalable accuracy is developed. The featured technique combines a finite-volume time-domain and a pseudo-spectral time-domain approach which divide the domain into manageable regions. This concept leads to very accurate and economical discrete models, free of lattice artifacts. Results, compared with reference or measurement data, reveal the benefits of the miniaturized antennas and substantiate their potential applicability.	explicit and implicit methods;numerical analysis;scalability	Nikolaos V.

Our pulse design algorithm provides a flexible and effective method for designing suitable pulses for ultra-wideband communication applications that comply with frequency emission constraints.	algorithm;bandlimiting;bit error rate;effective method;gaussian (software);interference (communication);numerical analysis;spectral density;ultra-wideband;variable shadowing	Norman C.

The advantage of WPM is that it allows signal time and frequency to be divided and multiplexed. Therefore the time and frequency of noise signals, e. g., tone and impulse noise, can be identified and effectively partitioned in packets. Using this advantage, we propose a class-coded modulation method for WPM that has good bit error rate (BER) performance when the length of the code constraint is extended and can select time and frequency noise signals simultaneously.

The 5th generation (5G) M-MIMO radio system is deployed with beamforming techniques over 3-D environment that contains the correlation phenomenon between angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD). Moreover, the determination of moment generating function (MGF) and characteristic function (CF) approaches is applied to derive analytical expression of BER for 3-D M-MIMO in order to avoid some difficult steps. Besides, the channel capacity is presented by using of mutual information to confirm the accuracy of the theoretical derived formulas. Furthermore, the work of performance evaluation is with different numbers of transmitter and receiver antenna. The correlation parameter between AoA and AoD definitely generates impact on the performance of BER when consider an M-MIMO system over the simplified 3-D channel and beamforming transmission.	mimo;performance evaluation;pre-shared key;x.690	Joy Iong-Zong Chen;Bo Hueng Lee;Wen Bin Wu	2018	Computers & Electrical Engineering	10.1016/j.compeleceng.2017.04.029	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	NLP	39.32840102605823	78.52095226738471	121863

Yet, ensuring a high speed internet access at high mobility is challenging. Indeed, high mobility leads to Doppler shifts that result in Inter Carrier Interference (ICI) in OFDM-based wireless systems. Many ICI equalization techniques have been proposed, yet these incur an additional computational complexity and hence higher energy consumption. In this work, we propose a very low complexity interference reduction method. Based on a linear modeling of the channel variation, we derive relations between the interference terms at the different subcarriers and show that interference can be significantly reduced through simple linear operations.	adaptive histogram equalization;approximation;computational complexity theory;ici (programming language);interference (communication);internet access;subcarrier	Youssef El Hajj Shehadeh;Sebastian Baumgärtner;Danai Chasaki;Gangolf Hirtz	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)	10.1109/ICCE.2015.7066561	single antenna interference cancellation;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio;frequency domain;computer network	EDA	46.891348484965455	80.87004474857099	121965

The NG provides the MUD’s with the equivariant and superfficiency properties, making them near-far resistant by construction and their convergence optimal. Moreover, the complexity of these structures is significantly reduced. These novel solutions are successfully applied to the multiuser synchronous CDMA channel.	centralized computing;decorrelation;gradient;information geometry;interference (communication);mud;multi-user;multiuser dos;sensor	Juan José Murillo-Fuentes;Francisco Javier González-Serrano;Javier Ramos;Antonio J.

This form of distortion is particularly problematic when the system employs Optical-OFDM because of the high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of its time domain symbol. This paper proposes using ancillary statistical properties of the O-OFDM signal in order to mitigate LED nonlinearities in an unsupervised fashion. By exploring the Gaussianity of the time domain OFDM signal and the idea of distribution equalization, we propose a semi-parametric approach to blind nonlinear post-equalization for asymmetrically clipped O-OFDM (ACO-OFDM) VLC systems. In addition to not requiring training data, the equalizer is robust to different LED types and it is adaptive to time-varying nonlinearities. Simulations with a realistic LED model show that the developed tool is capable of substantially mitigating the effects of nonlinear distortion on system performance.	blind equalization;device configuration overlay;distortion;equalization (communications);mimo-ofdm;noise (electronics);nonlinear system;power architecture platform reference;rate–distortion theory;semiconductor industry;simulation;vlc media player	Flávio R.

The efficacy of the proposed receiver is demonstrated on the physical layer (PHY) specified in the IEEE 802.11b wireless local area network (WLAN) standard. Packet error rate (PER) performance is compared with that of the conventional RAKE receiver. The proposed receiver structure and its low complexity variations demonstrate significant performance advantages over the RAKE receiver, especially in severe multipath channels. While a large delay spread can limit the performance of two low-complexity variations discussed here, performance of the optimal symbol DFE receiver is not limited by delay spread as long as the channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is sufficiently high.	bit error rate;equalization (communications);key (cryptography);multipath propagation;phy (chip);rake;signal-to-noise ratio	Younggyun Kim;Jaekyun Moon	2004	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2004.836839	equalization;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;demodulation;signal-to-noise ratio;spread spectrum;physical layer;computer network;complementary code keying;rake receiver	Mobile	43.22096179771232	75.25658109769968	122236
f704e3679a1979c1f5ab124e1bc57f465f88fc93	novel opportunistic interference mitigation schemes for heterogeneous networks	quantization codebook interference mitigation schemes heterogeneous networks uplink cross tier interference hetnets opportunistic interference alignment macrocell users adaptive reference signal spaces a rss channel state information macrocell base station;interference femtocells macrocell networks measurement computer integrated manufacturing uplink quantization signal;radiofrequency interference broadcasting cellular radio	This paper considers to mitigate the uplink cross- tier interference (CI) in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) by the idea of opportunistic transmission. Firstly, we introduce the conventional opportunistic interference alignment (OIA) into HetNets and it indeed reduces the CI from the macrocell users (MUs) effectively. Interestingly, based on the unique characteristic in HetNets, the performance of OIA can be further improved. Therefore, the novel opportunistic interference mitigation (OIM) schemes based on adaptive reference signal spaces (A-RSSs) are proposed. In the novel OIM, an A-RSS is defined for each FBS and the A-RSS of a FBS constantly updates as the channel state information (CSI) of its FUs changes. According to the A-RSSs of all FBSs, each MU calculates its scheduling metric and the macrocell base station (MBS) selects MUs by the metrics. However, broadcasting the A-RSS constantly makes the system more complicated, so a complexity- performance tradeoff is considered. To decrease the complexity of the system, the quantization codebook is introduced and the quantized A-RSS based OIM is proposed. At last, extensive simulations are conducted. It is shown that, in terms of femtocells, the performance of novel OIM is better than that of the codebook based OIM (CB-OIM) and the performance of CB-OIM is better than that of conventional OIA.	channel state information;codebook;function-behaviour-structure ontology;interference (communication);multitier architecture;online identity management;oracle identity management;overhead (computing);rss;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link	Deyue Zhang;Hui Gao;Yuan Ren;Tiejun Lv;Chau Yuen	2015	2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145957	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	40.291141179361624	85.617932722257	122241

The features are based on sample mean and sample variance of the imaginary part of the product of two consecutive complex signal values. Root raised cosine pulses are used to generate the linearly modulated signals. Support vector machines are employed to distinguish the signals. One benefit of using support vector machines is that it requires very few realizations for training. Moreover, no a priori information is required about carrier amplitude, carrier phase, carrier offset, symbol rate, pulse shape, initial symbol phase (timing offset) and channel impulse response. Effectiveness of the features and signal separation by support vector machines is tested by observing the joint effects of additive white Gaussian noise, carrier offset, lack of symbol and sampling synchronization, and either fast or slow fading. In the course of doing that, the proposed classifier is compared to the wavelet based classifier, equipped by support vector machines.	additive white gaussian noise;imaginary time;key (cryptography);modulation;oversampling;pre-shared key;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simple features;simulation;support vector machine;utility functions on indivisible goods;wavelet;window function	Mohammad Bari;Milos Doroslovacki	2015	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2014.2363615	carrierless amplitude phase modulation;continuous phase modulation;support vector machine;minimum-shift keying;quadrature amplitude modulation;on-off keying;telecommunications;amplitude and phase-shift keying;computer science;phase-shift keying;mathematics;frequency-shift keying;quadrature modulation	ML	52.62148191492704	78.62145683257343	122263

Via transmit and receive processing, we transform the original OFDM system into an equivalent one with fewer subcarriers. By reducing transmission rate, we are able to design a transmitted signal structure with inherent ICI self-cancellation capability without requiring the instantaneous channel state information. We develop a general structure of transmit and receive processing matrices so that all equivalent subchannels in the transformed OFDM system have the same average signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). For the developed structure, we further optimize the transmit and the receive processing coefficients to maximize the SIR based on channel statistics. Numerical and simulation results demonstrate that the developed reduced-rate OFDM transmission achieves an SIR gain of around 5 dB over the existing ICI self-cancellation schemes and significantly reduces the error floor at the receiver.	channel state information;coefficient;digital subchannel;error floor;frequency divider;ici (programming language);interference (communication);multiplexing;numerical analysis;numerical method;one-to-one (data model);simulation;subcarrier	Jun Ma;Philip V.

In this paper, maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of the Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) and Sampling Frequency Offset (SFO) are investigated in the framework of LTE downlink, aiming at precisely tracking time-varying fluctuations of the impairments. In order to make the tracking independent of the time index of the OFDM symbol, the differential CFO and SFO tracking algorithm are proposed. Combined with the phase ambiguity cancellation scheme, the differential tracking algorithm can work with high accuracy. The performances are analyzed and evaluated through simulations.	algorithm;ambiguity function;carrier frequency;channel state information;compaq lte;frequency offset;hole accumulation diode;performance;sampling (signal processing);simulation;telecommunications link;tree accumulation	Kaifeng Guo;Wen Xu;Guangxia Zhou	2011	2011 IEEE 73rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2011.5956576	electronic engineering;real-time computing;time–frequency analysis;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;maximum likelihood	Visualization	50.637509805666404	78.34609722778063	122600

Due to a concern of complexity, codebooks used in the analog beamforming are limited to their size. This paper shows that if the limited codebooks are made up of orthogonal steering vectors, the analog beamforming can be implemented with low complexity by exploiting implicit knowledge of the channel and then the resulting effective channel should be estimated explicitly to determine the optimal weighting coefficients in the digital beamforming. The simulation results show that the proposed low-complexity beamforming method can achieve nearly the same data rates as the one with perfectly known channel state information.	beamforming;channel state information;codebook;coefficient;complexity;simulation;throughput	Hsiao-Lan Chiang;Wolfgang Rave;Tobias Kadur;Gerhard P.

Transmitted waveforms with the proposed covariance matrix, at the receiver, significantly supress the side-lobe levels compared to phased-array, MIMO-radar, and phased-MIMO schemes. Moreover, in contrast to phased-MIMO our proposed scheme allows same power transmission from each antenna.

Moreover, the combination of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) offers a strong alternative to satisfy the demand for high data rates with rigorous quality-of-service (QoS) restrictions. In this study, this paper applies a closed-loop pre-equalisation methodology under a unified framework for MIMO and MC-CDMA systems that satisfies the QoS target with a single-user-based detector while minimising the power of the pre-equalisation factors. It is of particular interest to investigate the impact and limitations of combining the robustness of the feedback scheme with the degrees of freedom available in the system, given in terms of the number of subcarriers and multiple antennas. The contribution of this work includes the derivation of the distributed and centralised optimal closed-loop pre-equalisation solutions under the MIMO–MC-CDMA structure. The results and analysis illustrate important gains in the form of power savings, enabled by the spatial diversity of the MIMO scheme.	adaptive equalizer;mimo;multi-user;profiling (computer programming)	Jose Martin Luna-Rivera;Daniel U.

We describe two design approaches, namely, consistency in the probabilistic sense and absolute consistency. Existing preambles and pilot designs in the literature do not guarantee the absolute consistency. We derive general criteria for both approaches, present sufficient conditions on the pilot structures over the maximum carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation range (half of the sampling rate), and derive simple pilot designs satisfying these conditions. We also extend the sufficient conditions to any arbitrary but fixed CFO estimation range, and present some generalized design patterns. Furthermore, the CFO estimation performances of distinct consistent pilot designs can be quite different at moderate or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to different statistics of outliers which also yields a link failure. We develop efficient pilot-design criteria that provide both consistency and robustness against outliers at moderate-to-low SNR.

The performance of this LMMSE receiver is evaluated and shown to be superior to that of the other two schemes, equal-gain combining (EQC) and maximum-ratio combining (MRC). However, a perfect timing estimation of the desired user is needed for these receivers, as a misaligned sampling interval of these receivers results in severely self intersymbol interference (ISI) and intercarrier interference (ICI) for the desired signal at the output. In order to remove the timing acquisition requirement of a receiver for an asynchronous MC-CDMA system, we proposed a novel partial sampling MMSE (PS-MMSE) receiver. Numerical result shows that the PS-MMSE receiver without timing knowledge provides significantly stronger interference suppression capability than the LMMSE receiver with known timing. Moreover, a so-called reduced complexity partial sampling MMSE (RPS-MMSE) receiver is proposed to make the number of the receiver’s taps independent of the number of subcarriers. Results show that with a proper grouping parameter, a much less complicated RPS-MMSE receiver achieves almost the same performance as the PS-MMSE receiver. Thus, one is able to implement an MMSE receiver without a prior timing requirement to perform multiuser detection for the MC-CDMA system in an asynchronous scenario at the expense of a slight complexity increase.	catastrophic interference;ici (programming language);information sciences institute;interference (communication);mean squared error;multi-user;ps-algol;rayleigh fading;sampling (signal processing);subcarrier;web server;zero suppression	Pingping Zong;Kunjie Wang;Yeheskel Bar-Ness	2001	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.942521	code division multiple access;index term;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;radio receiver;computational complexity theory;spread spectrum;intersymbol interference;detection theory	Mobile	48.31559467164462	77.29298425768661	123119

Because wireless passive sensor networks reduce the dependence on the batteries, they have great potential to be used in body sensing applications. In a typical sensor network deployment, multiple passive sensor nodes modulate a common carrier. The superimposed reflected signals can be resolved by using code division multiple access (CDMA) principles. In practical systems however, a strong carrier component will leak to the receiver, causing offset to the constellation points and as a result it will destroy cross correlation properties of the CDMA codes. To address this problem, we propose a code shift modulation instead of vanilla CDMA. We develop maximum likelihood receiver and analyse its performance. Since the complexity of ML detection strategy scales exponentially with the number of sensors, we develop a reduced complexity detection technique based on Probabilistic Data Association (PDA). We demonstrate via numerical simulations that our reduced complexity detector approaches the ML performance.	algorithm;code;computer simulation;correspondence problem;cross-correlation;modulation;multi-user;numerical analysis;personal digital assistant;sensor;software deployment;video-in video-out	Wenxing Xu;Robert J.

The semi-blind SC-CP system also outperforms its OFDM counterpart with perfect CSI at high Signal to Noise Ratios (SNRs).	blind equalization;cp system;channel state information;convolution;equalization (communications);independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;mimo;overhead (computing);semiconductor industry;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spatial multiplexing;spectral efficiency	Luciano Sarperi;Xu Zhu;Asoke K.

This equalization exploits the guard interval (GI) redundancy together with the excess codes (EC) to restore the structural properties of MC-CDMA signal destroyed by multipath fading channels. Indeed, since in CDMA based wireless systems, the number of users per cell is significantly less than the spreading factor, a base station can set apart a subset of the codes, the excess codes that will not be used for spreading. It is shown that the joint use of the EC and GI redundancy improves significantly the equalization performance compared to the GI only or EC only cases. A second contribution consists in exploiting the previous information together with the one given by a pilot sequence in a semi blind scheme to further improve the performance. Finally, we propose a new adaptive algorithm for the estimation and tracking of the equalizer that has a faster convergence rate compared to existing algorithms of similar complexity order. Simulation based performance evaluations are given at the end of this paper to assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods in MC-CDMA.	adaptive algorithm;blind equalization;code;equalization (communications);multipath propagation;offset binary;rate of convergence;semiconductor industry;simulation;telecommunications link	Ahmed Bouzidi Djebbar;Karim Abed-Meraim;Ali Djebbari	2009	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2009.0901.060676	niobium;code division multiple access;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;time domain;computer science;engineering;base station;blind equalization;rate of convergence;redundancy;computational complexity theory	Mobile	48.88142356407041	78.47892995158739	123416

Especially, zero-IF receivers are very appealing, because they avoid costly IF filters. However, this implies IQ demodulation at RF, which therefore cannot be done digitally and thus introduces IQ mismatch. Unfortunately, OFDM is very sensitive to receiver IQ imbalance. Therefore, we developed a new compensation scheme to combat the IQ imbalance at baseband. In this paper, we describe the algorithm and present the performance results. Our compensation scheme eliminates the IQ imbalance almost perfectly. This leads to tremendous improvements, especially in multi-path channels (up to 10 dB performance gain), and enables lowcost zero-IF receivers.	algorithm;baseband;channel state information;decibel;phase noise;radio frequency;sybase iq	Jan Tubbax;Boris Come;Liesbet Van der Perre;Luc Deneire;Stéphane Donnay;Marc Engels	2003		10.1109/ICC.2003.1204086	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory	Mobile	51.652736047842815	79.13481630157735	123505

Rayleigh fading channels. With this motivation, we first derive the receiver structure for the optimum SC scheme, which combines one out of the available L diversity branches so as to minimize the probability of bit error. We show that the optimum SC scheme chooses the diversity branch having the largest magnitude of the logarithm of the a posteriori probability ratio (LAPPR) of the transmitted information bit. We also show that: 1) the optimum noncoherent diversity receiver, for binary NCFSK signals, is equivalent to combining the LAPPRs of all the diversity branches; 2) the SC scheme proposed by Neasmith and Beaulieu is a special case of the optimum SC scheme for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading; and 3) for i.n.d. fading with dual diversity (i.e., L=2), the performance of the optimum SC scheme is the same as that of the optimum noncoherent diversity receiver, whereas the Neasmith and Beaulieu SC scheme gives the performance of the suboptimum equal gain combining receiver. Bit-error rate (BER) results show that, at 10/sup -4/ BER, for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading, the proposed optimum SC scheme performs better than the existing SC schemes by 0.5-0.9 dB for L=3 and by 0.8-1.5 dB for L=5, and performs within 0.3 dB of the optimum noncoherent diversity receiver for L=3,5, and for i.n.d. Rayleigh fading with L=5, the optimum SC scheme gives an additional gain of about 2.0 dB over the Pierce SC scheme. Further, for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading, we derive the bit-error probability expression for a (3,L) selection scheme which combines three branches whose LAPPR magnitudes are the largest among the available L branches. Numerical results for this (3,L) selection scheme show that for L=5 at a BER of 10/sup -4/, combining the three branches with the largest LAPPR magnitudes yields almost the full performance of the optimum noncoherent diversity receiver, whereas, for L=7, it is just about 0.2 dB away from the latter.	bit error rate;decibel;key (cryptography);modulation;numerical linear algebra;rayleigh fading;x.690	Ramesh Annavajjala;Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam;Laurence B.

We present a promising IFDE scheme dubbed iterativeblock decision feedback equalization (IB-DFE) and propose a post-equalization phase noise estimation scheme within the iteration chain. In fact, by exploiting the Gaussianity of the equalizer output we are able to track the phase noise value by updating the state posterior distribution using the GSPF algorithm. Additionally, simulation results are presented considering QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM signalling in highly frequency-selective channels and different values for the phase noise variance and linear drift.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;equalization (communications);iteration;modulation;particle filter;phase noise;simulation	Pedro Pedrosa;Rui Dinis;Fernando Duarte Nunes;António Rodrigues	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6884009	gaussian noise;telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;phase noise	EDA	48.45489964043884	75.47216758570629	123849

In this paper, an Finite impulse response (FIR) precoder which supports multiple streams at the transmitter and an FIR minimum mean-squared-error decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE) at the receiver are jointly designed for broadband multi-input multi-output (MIMO) multicast systems. At the base station (transmitter), the FIR precoder design is combined by an FIR matrix multiplied by a unitary one, where the first one is optimized to maximize the system throughput, and the second one is aiming for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fairness among different data streams. Moreover, a Givens-based algorithm is employed to construct the unitary matrix in the multicast system. For each user (receiver), the corresponding FIR MMSE-DFE is derived to eliminate inter-symbol interference (ISI) introduced by both the multicast channel and the FIR filter used at the transmitter. The numerical simulations indicate that the proposed transceiver design with FIR structure has considerable improvement over the existing schemes in terms of BER performance.	algorithm;equalization (communications);fairness measure;finite impulse response;information sciences institute;interference (communication);mimo;multicast;numerical analysis;selectivity (electronic);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;throughput;transceiver;transmitter;x.690	Zilong Zhang;Xiaodong Xu;Zhiyong Chen;Jun Chen	2014	2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992008	3g mimo;electronic engineering;telecommunications;control theory	Mobile	48.80602077458085	81.80517127411188	124026

In a MIMO-OFDM frequency division duplex (FDD) system, the amount of CSI required by the transmitter increases linear with the number of subcarriers, and therefore becomes prohibitive for a large bandwidth configuration. Conventional schemes based on broadband analog CSI feedback can reduce the overhead, but has limitations to achieve higher spectral efficiency and feedback robustness. In this paper we first propose a novel broadband analog CSI feedback framework for MIMO-OFDM systems based on the distributed compressive sensing (DCS) theory. Then, we further optimize this framework to maximize its feedback benefits. By exploiting the sparse common support (joint sparsity) inherent in MIMO channels and taking advantage of the high efficiency of DCS in encoding original MIMO channels, the proposed framework is capable of significantly reducing the overhead and enhancing the robustness. The numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	analysis of algorithms;bridging (networking);channel state information;compressed sensing;computational complexity theory;duplex (telecommunications);feedback;frequency divider;interference (communication);mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);sparse matrix;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;transmitter	Peng Cheng;Zhuo Chen;Chang-Kyung Sung	2014	2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136125	3g mimo;multi-user mimo;mimo-ofdm;sparse matrix;telecommunications;interpolation;control theory;frequency domain;spatial multiplexing;precoding;statistics;mimo	Mobile	49.58206916686027	80.80695449160335	124151

8103e2a22614e976bfb645387ee93c78501020e3	a novel receiver design with joint coherent and non-coherent processing		"""In this paper, we propose a novel splitting receiver, which involves a joint processing of coherently and non-coherently received signals. Using a passive RF power splitter, the received signal at each receiver antenna is split into two streams, which are then processed by a conventional coherent detection (CD) circuit and a power-detection (PD) circuit, respectively. The streams of the signals from all the receiver antennas are then jointly used for information detection. We show that the splitting receiver creates a 3-D received signal space due to the joint coherent and non-coherent processing. We analyze the achievable rate of a splitting receiver, which shows that the splitting receiver provides a rate gain of 3/2 compared with either the conventional (CD-based) coherent receiver or the PD-based non-coherent receiver in the high SNR regime. We also analyze the symbol error rate (SER) for practical modulation schemes, which shows that the splitting receiver achieves asymptotic SER reduction by a factor of at least <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\sqrt {M}-1$ </tex-math></inline-formula> for <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$M$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-QAM compared with either the conventional (CD-based) coherent receiver or the PD-based non-coherent receiver."""	carrier recovery;coherent;demultiplexer (media file);modulation;power dividers and directional couplers;radio frequency;signal-to-noise ratio	Wanchun Liu;Xiangyun Zhou;Salman Durrani;Petar Popovski	2017	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2698475	tuned radio frequency receiver;rf front end;modulation;direct-conversion receiver;electronic engineering;computer science;qam;radio receiver design;low if receiver;signal-to-noise ratio	Security	42.3122551217341	78.94518101595926	124274

Demultiplexing high-rate users typically entails, at the receiver end, a time-varying processing if Variable Spreading Length (VSL), Variable Chip Rate (VCR), or Variable Chip Rate with Frequency Shift (VCRFS) modulation formats are used, and Rake-Type demodulation schemes if the chip rate exceeds the channel coherence bandwidth. The realization of fully adaptive receivers thus requires the joint estimation of (a) the interference to be suppressed, whether from other users of the high-rate network or from the secondary network, and (b) the channel tap weights. The solution that we consider here assumes that, for each user, a pilot signal is transmitted along with the information-bearing signal, whether in a time-multiplexed or in a parallel-channel format. We consider both the uplink and the downlink channel and, based on a Minimum-Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) optimality criterion, we have come up with a fully adaptive system, capable on the one hand of tracking, through a cyclic RecursiveLeast-Squares type algorithm, the periodically time-varying variations of the interference subspace and on the other of updating the channel tap weights estimates. A thorough performance assessment is presented, and the convergence dynamics of the system are derived through computer simulations in order to assess the impact of the prior uncertainty with regard to the other-users signatures and the channel tap weights realizations.	adaptive system;algorithm;channel state information;computer simulation;electronic signature;emoticon;interference (communication);modulation;multiplexing;optimality criterion;rake;telecommunications link;videocassette recorder	Stefano Buzzi;Marco Lops;Antonia Maria Tulino	2001	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1023/A:1008926902988	computer simulation;chip;minimum mean square error;telecommunications;computer science;adaptive system;control theory;fading	Mobile	45.694320821979744	77.86166872301091	124303

In this study, the authors introduce an efficient low-complexity joint regularised equalisation and carrier frequency offset compensation (LJREC) scheme for single-carrier frequency division multiple access system. The proposed LJREC scheme avoids the noise amplification problem and the estimation of the signal-to-noise ratio and the interference matrices of other users. From the obtained simulation results, the proposed scheme enhances the system performance with lower complexity and sufficient robustness to the estimation errors.	additive white gaussian noise;carrier frequency offset;download;frequency divider;interference (communication);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Faisal S.

At most 2M - 1 - 1 beamforming vectors with the same beampattern can be generated from any given beamforming vector, where M is the size of the beamforming vector. Thus, one can start with a single (mother) beamforming vector, which gives a desired beampattern, but may not satisfy some other desired properties, and generate all other beamforming vectors, which give the same beampattern, in a computationally efficient way. Then the beamforming vectors, which in addition satisfy other desired properties that the mother beamforming vector may not satisfy, can be selected. Such procedure is developed in this letter in the application to the transmit beamspace design that ensures practically important properties for multiple-input multiple-output radar. A computationally efficient sub-optimal method for selecting best beamforming vectors from a population of vectors that give the same beampattern is also developed.	algorithmic efficiency;beamforming;column (database);direction of arrival;mimo;radar;radiation pattern;transformation matrix	Aboulnasr Hassanien;Sergiy A.

cc8775d696416d058fd369b1667ac4a2387cdf4f	prediction of the optimal threshold value in df relay selection schemes based on artificial neural networks	protocols;radial basis function networks;artificial neural networks;cooperative communication;neurons;relays	In wireless communications, the cooperative communication (CC) technology promises performance gains compared to traditional Single-Input Single Output (SISO) techniques. Therefore, the CC technique is one of the nominees for 5G networks. In the Decode-and-Forward (DF) relaying scheme which is one of the CC techniques, determination of the threshold value at the relay has a key role for the system performance and power usage. In this paper, we propose prediction of the optimal threshold values for the best relay selection scheme in cooperative communications, based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for the first time in literature. The average link qualities and number of relays have been used as inputs in the prediction of optimal threshold values using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks. The MLP network has better performance from the RBF network on the prediction of optimal threshold value when the same number of neurons is used at the hidden layer for both networks. Besides, the optimal threshold values obtained using ANNs are verified by the optimal threshold values obtained numerically using the closed form expression derived for the system. The results show that the optimal threshold values obtained by ANNs on the best relay selection scheme provide a minimum Bit-Error-Rate (BER) because of the reduction of the probability that error propagation may occur. Also, for the same BER performance goal, prediction of optimal threshold values provides 2dB less power usage, which is great gain in terms of green communication.	artificial neural network;bit error rate;cooperative mimo;direction finding;memory-level parallelism;multilayer perceptron;numerical analysis;propagation of uncertainty;quad flat no-leads package;radial (radio);radial basis function network;relay;soft-in soft-out decoder;software propagation;x.690	Ferdi Kara;Hakan Kaya;Okan Erkaymaz;Ertan Ozturk	2016	2016 International Symposium on INnovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)	10.1109/INISTA.2016.7571823	telecommunications;engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Mobile	41.418619136223874	82.14124294361682	124597

As a performance improvement method, performance distortion can be improved by applying convolution coding. As a result, in OFDM system, we could see that the higher a frequency offset is, the worse performance will be, and we could see that there was performance improvement by applying convolution coding in OFDM system in order to reach (BER=). However, when we use 64QAM (64Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), there was a huge influence between carriers by frequency offset at 0.05, 0.1.	carrier frequency;profiling (computer programming)	Jiwoong Kim;Heau-Jo Kang;Kwon-Hyun Lee	2004	J.

We explicitly take communication aspects into account and propose a number of distributed pre-coding (beamforming) schemes allowing for an over-the-air compressed representation of the set of spatially correlated observations. Those observations are then encoded in a number of consecutive sensor-to-Fusion Center (FC) transmissions. The ultimate goal is to minimize the distortion in the reconstructed random field and, simultaneously, keep the number of transmissions low (i.e., the compression ratio high). Specifically, we first propose a family of distributed pre-coding schemes based on the Karhunen-Loève (KL) and partial KL transforms and we derive closed form expressions of the optimal power allocation strategies. Aspects such as residual phase synchronization errors or the fact that some sensors might be idle (inactive) are specifically taken into account in the analysis. Next, we propose an iterative and greedy scheme by which the pre-coder design and power allocation problems can be jointly solved for the general case. We assess the performance of the proposed pre-coding schemes by means of computer simulations. Other uncompressed transmission schemes are used as a benchmark.	beamforming;benchmark (computing);computer simulation;distortion;greedy algorithm;iterative method;principal component analysis;scheme;sensor	Javier Matamoros;Carles Antón-Haro	2014	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2014.2362750	mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Mobile	44.72644808675534	88.26147011075736	124926

Studied on the basis of a mutual information lower bound, joint processing is found to provide a non-negligible advantage relative to separate processing, particularly for fast fading. It is shown that, regardless of the fading rate, only a very small number of pilot symbols (at most one per transmit antenna and per channel coherence interval) should be transmitted if joint processing is allowed.	mutual information;sensor;spectral efficiency	Nihar Jindal;Angel E.

An additional filtering is not required to remove the out-of-band (OOB) spectrum radiation as required in the conventional clipping method. The IC is designed with a minimized computational complexity though the iteration is performed. The results confirm that the CI/OFDM with the proposed IC presents many advantages in terms of BER performance and OOB spectrum radiation. Based on the optimization on BER and OOB spectrum, it is found that 2 and 3 iterations is an effective number for the IC in OFDM and CI/OFDM systems, respectively. The total degradation (TD) improvement by the effective IC in CI/OFDM is about 0.32 dB for QPSK and 2.1 dB for 64 QAM symbol on an SSPA with an output-back-off (OBO) 4dB and 8 dB, respectively.	audio power amplifier;clipping (computer graphics);computational complexity theory;elegant degradation;iteration;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;open biomedical ontologies;out-of-bag error;out-of-band agreement;performance;solid-state drive;x.690	Khoirul Anwar;Takao Hara;Minoru Okada	2008	2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699570	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;nonlinear system;computer science;mathematics;computer performance	Arch	47.78865609348711	80.24387401003416	125125

We assume that the sensors make independent local decisions on the M hypotheses under test and report these decisions to the fusion center using differential phase-shift keying (DPSK), so as to avoid the channel estimation overhead entailed by coherent decision fusion. For this setup we derive the optimal and three low-complexity, suboptimal fusion rules which do not require knowledge of the instantaneous fading gains. The suboptimal fusion rules are obtained by applying certain approximations to the optimal fusion rule and are referred to as Chair-Varshney (CV), ideal local sensors (ILS), and max-log fusion rules. Since all proposed fusion rules exploit an observation window of at least two symbol intervals, we refer to them collectively as multiple-symbol differential (MSD) fusion rules. For binary hypothesis testing, we derive performance bounds for the optimal fusion rule and exact or approximate analytical expressions for the probabilities of false alarm and detection for all three suboptimal fusion rules. Simulation and analytical results show that whereas the CV and ILS fusion rules approach the performance of the optimal fusion rule for high and low channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), respectively, the max-log fusion rule performs close-to-optimal for the entire range of SNRs. Furthermore, in fast fading channels significant performance gains can be achieved for the considered MSD fusion rules by increasing the observation window to more than two symbol intervals.	approximation algorithm;channel state information;coherence (physics);differential phase;key (cryptography);mobile phone;modulation;oracle fusion architecture;overhead (computing);sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Andre Lei;Robert Schober	2009	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425997	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;fading	Mobile	39.831500647687214	80.36495285971375	125150

Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) is MUI-free, but it does not enable the available channel diversity without employing error-control coding. On the other hand, coded OFDMA may achieve lower diversity than a CDMA system employing the same error-control codes. In this paper, we merge the advantages of OFDMA and CDMA to minimize MUI effects, and also enable the maximum available diversity for every user. In our group orthogonal multicarrier CDMA (GO-MC-CDMA) scheme, groups of users share a set of subcarriers. By judiciously choosing group subcarriers, we guarantee that every user transmits with maximum diversity. MUI is only present among users in the same group, and is suppressed via multiuser detection, which becomes practically feasible because we assign a small number of users per group. Performance is analyzed, and simulations are carried out to illustrate the merits of GO-MC-CDMA relative to existing alternatives.	catastrophic interference;code;decibel;elegant degradation;emoticon;error detection and correction;interference (communication);mud;magic user interface;multi-user;multipath propagation;simulation;subcarrier;transmitter	Xiaodong Cai;Shengli Zhou;Georgios B.

We study the transmission schemes for an amplify-and-forward relay-aided D2D system which has multiple antennas. To circumvent the prohibitive complexity problem of traditional maximum likelihood (ML) detection for full-rate space-time block code (FSTBC) transmission, two low-complexity detection methods are proposed, i.e., the detection methods with the ML-combining (MLC) algorithm and the joint conditional ML (JCML) detector. Particularly, the method with the JCML detector reduces detection delay at the cost of more storage and performs well with parallel implementation. Simulation results indicate that the proposed detection methods achieve a symbol error probability similar to that of the traditional ML detector for FSTBC transmission but with less complexity, and the performance of FSTBC transmission is significantly better than that of spatial multiplexing transmission. Diversity analysis for the proposed detection methods is also demonstrated by simulations.	algorithm;block code;multi-level cell;parallel computing;processing delay;relay;simulation;spatial multiplexing;symantec endpoint protection	Kangli Zhang;Fanglin Gu;Jian Wang	2017	Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering	10.1631/FITEE.1700018	spatial multiplexing;control theory;block code;maximum likelihood;full rate;computer science;space–time block code;theoretical computer science;computer hardware;detector;relay;cellular network	HPC	46.179784809543044	76.23181004475516	125302

Unlike the conventional conjugate beamforming which activates all the antenna elements to radiate the signals, our PACB activates only a fraction of the antennas by exploiting the spatial structure of LoS channel, and it can mitigate the inter-user interference more effectively, leading to dramatically enhanced downlink spectral efficiency. A low-complexity search algorithm is also introduced to calculate the optimal number of activated antennas. Theoretical analysis and simulation results both confirm that our PACB offers significantly higher downlink spectral efficiency compared to its conventional beamforming counterpart.	beamforming;interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);mimo;radiate;search algorithm;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Wendong Liu;Zhaocheng Wang;Jianfei Cao;Sheng Chen;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2872953	mimo;conjugate;telecommunications link;computer science;distributed computing;interference (wave propagation);beamforming;search algorithm;electronic engineering;spectral efficiency;communication channel	Mobile	42.81934821435876	85.5398990110349	125785
a3bdb3c17bcebbe0d79952fb3ddfb940111531bd	subcarrier-interlaced fdd for faster-than-tdd channel tracking in massive mimo systems		Canonical Massive MIMO uses time division duplex (TDD) to exploit channel reciprocity within the coherence time, avoiding feedback of channel state information (CSI), as is required for precoding at the base station. We extend the idea of exploiting reciprocity to the coherence bandwidth, allocating subcarriers of a multicarrier (OFDM)-based system in an interlaced fashion to upand downlink, respectively, referred to as (OFDM-)subcarrier interlaced FDD (IFDD). Exploiting this “two-dimensional” channel reciprocity within both time and frequency coherence does not require any CSI feedback and, even more so, offers faster-than-TDD channel tracking. To address imperfections of actual hardware, we conducted measurements, verifying the practical viability of IFDD. As it turns out, the scheme incurs similar transmit/receive isolation issues (self-interference) as well-known from the full-duplex (FDup) literature. As will be shown, such hardware challenges like self-interference or frequency offsets are not critical for massive MIMO operation, but can be neglected as the number of antennas grows large. Finally, we quantify how IFDD allows to track the channel variations much faster than TDD over a wide range of commonly used pilot symbol rates.	channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);frequency divider;frequency offset;interference (communication);interlaced video;mimo;simulation interoperability standards organization;subcarrier;telecommunications link;test-driven development;verification and validation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Maximilian Arnold;Xiaojie Wang;Stephan ten Brink	2018			subcarrier;mimo;mathematical optimization;channel state information;coherence time;precoding;coherence bandwidth;mathematics;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;communication channel	Networks	49.55882364084558	81.29060194736805	125910

When carrier frequency is ultra-high and/or bandwidth is ultra-wide, the impact of IQI on system performance is not negligible. While in most of the literatures, the combined effect of channel, TX, and RX IQI is discussed, in this paper, a method that can separate and simultaneously estimate the three is proposed. The complexity of the proposed method is low, and with estimated TX and RX IQI, simple symbol-by-symbol detection can be used to detect data symbols with negligible performance loss. Compared with the calibration methods, where auxiliary circuits are needed to separate the TX and RX IQI belonging to different communication links inside a transceiver, by exploiting the fact that the wireless channel changes much faster than the IQI, the method proposed here can separate not only the TX and RX IQI but also the channel belonging to the same communication link without any auxiliary circuits. Simulations are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed method.	carrier frequency;computer simulation;modulation;transceiver	Yabo Li;Linlin Z Fan;Hai Lin;Minjian Zhao	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6655286	calibration;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science	Robotics	52.18093864688288	78.83553136547526	126022

Authors present channel estimation techniques based on Least Squares (LS) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) algorithms and channel equalization based on Zero Forcing (Z F) and Minimum Mean Square Error (M M SE) methods. Performances analysis show that the MMSE channel estimator is better than the LS estimator in terms of mean square error for the two environments and the MMSE equalizer used for NB-PLC channel do not have good performances. Therefore, environment diversity can be exploited to enhance our system reliability.	algorithm;bit error rate;channel (communications);channel state information;equalization (communications);information security;least squares;mean squared error;methods of computing square roots;naive bayes classifier;performance;radio frequency;signal processing;smart meter;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Amani Aloui;Ons Ben Rhouma;Chiheb Rebai	2017	2017 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)	10.1109/ISNCC.2017.8072017	estimator;electronic engineering;signal processing;smart grid;telecommunications;equalization (audio);narrowband;minimum mean square error;mean squared error;communication channel;computer science	Robotics	45.13366163567524	77.88867161122201	126235

It is demonstrated that the high data users cause significant interference to the low data users if we do not employ beamforming. Furthermore, if we perform beamforming for both types of users, most of the gain we achieve is due to the high data users if the total power of the high data users is much higher than that of the low rate users. Thus we may reduce the computational requirement significantly if we perform beamforming for the high data users only with a small increase in total power.	beamforming;telecommunications link	Tao Luo;Elvino S.

Till now, however, various extended VP techniques are almost restricted to one antenna configuration of each user, termed as multi-user single-stream VP, which contradicts with the multi-antenna terminals of the next generation wireless systems. So, the popular block diagonal (BD) algorithm and VP was naturally combined and proposed to solve this problem. However, the so-called BD-VP completely suppresses multi-user interference at the expense of noise enhancement and results in performance degradation. To overcome the shortcoming of BD-VP, we propose three criteria based multi-user multistream VP (MUMS-VP) algorithms with different performance and complexity tradeoffs: zero-forcing expanded channel inversion (ZF ECI)-VP algorithm, minimum-total-meansquare-error criterion (MTMSE) based two MUMS-VP algorithms and maximum signalto-leakage-and-noise-ratio (MSLNR) criterion based MUMS-VP algorithm. The general expression of achievable rates of MUMS-VP algorithms is derived. Analysis and simulation results show that the proposed ZF MUMS-VP is equivalent to BD-VP, while MTMSE MUMS-VP II has the maximum achievable sum rates among these algorithms. MTMSE MUMS-VP I, II and MSLNR MUMS-VP greatly outperform BD-VP in BER performance for both fixed modulation scenario and adaptive modulation scenario. Furthermore, all proposed algorithms have much lower complexity than BD-VP.	adaptive filter;algorithm;blu-ray;elegant degradation;interference (communication);mimo;modulation;multi-user;next-generation network;simulation;spectral leakage;vp-info;vp/css;x.690;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Rui Chen;Jiandong Li;Changle Li;Wei Liu	2013	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-012-0576-8	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;mathematics;precoding;statistics;mimo	EDA	45.068740035629716	79.52467645583845	126448

The transmitter dynamically selects the optimum coding and modulation scheme according to the environment in order to maximize the spectrum and power efficiency. A constant average Bit Error Rate (BER) is maintained without changing (or with a very small change to) the transmitted power, and hence the scheme eases the power control requirements. In addition, a higher throughput can be achieved compared to Bxed (non adaptive) systems. Unlike other adaptive transmission systems, in our work the adaptation is based on the Rice factor. The paper also discusses a Rice factor estimation algorithm.	adaptive coding;algorithm;bit error rate;modulation;performance per watt;requirement;rice's theorem;throughput;transmitter;x.690	M. A. K.

To this end, we analyze the average quantization performance of the feedback strategies with or without PA feedback, respectively. By deriving the approximated bounds, we show that when the number of coordinated base stations is large and the number of antennas at each base station is small, the PA feedback will introduce evident performance gain especially for cell-edge users.

In addition, Monte Carlo SER simulation results are given for both systems. According to the obtained theoretical and simulation results, diversity order of the systems is equal to the number of total antennas at the relay, and thus it is shown that error performance of the conventional PLNC system is significantly improved by the proposed systems.

A conventional maximal ratio combining (MRC) is not an optimal method of combining (re)transmissions for the HARQ under the condition of the imperfect channel estimation. A modified MRC method is proposed, which allows decreasing the impact of the errors in the channel estimates to the performance of HSDPA.	channel state information;data rate units;hybrid automatic repeat request;maximal set;network packet;telecommunications link	Sergei Semenov	2004	2004 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (IEEE Cat.

Previous work in this area has focused on the narrowband flat fading case where spatial diversity only is available. In this paper, we investigate the use of space-time coding in OFDMbased broadband systems where both spatial and frequency diversity are available. We consider a strategy which basically consists of coding across OFDM tones and will therefore be called space-frequency coding. For a spatial broadband channel model taking into account physical propagation parameters and antenna spacing, we derive the design criteria f o r space-frequency codes and we show that space-time codes designed to achieve full spatial diversity in the narrowband case will in general not achieve full space-frequency diversity. Specifically, we show that the Alamouti scheme across tones fails to exploit frequency diversity. For a given set of propagation parameters and given antenna spacing, we establish the m a x i m u m achievable diversity order. Finally, we provide simulation results studying the influence of delay spread, propagation parameters, and antenna spacing on the performance of space-frequency codes. 1.

Diversity provides the receiver with several (ideally independent) replica of the transmitted signal and is therefore a powerful means to combat fading and interference. Common forms of diversity are time diversity (due to Doppler spread) and frequency diversity (due to delay spread). In recent years the use of spatial (or antenna) diversity has become increasingly popular. Spatial diversity is particularly attractive since it can be provided without loss in spectral efficiency.

We assume a block adaptive receiver in which the receiver coefficients are obtained from feedforward channel estimation. For the feedforward channel estimation, we propose a novel reduced dimension channel estimation procedure, where the number of unknown parameters are reduced usinga priori information of the transmit shaping filter’s impulse response. Fewer unknown parameters require a shorter training sequence. We obtain least-squares, maximum-likelihood, and maximuma posteriori (MAP) estimators for the reduced dimension channel estimation problem. For symbol detection, we propose the use of a matched filtered diversity combining decision feedback equalizer (DFE) instead of a straightforward diversity combining DFE. The matched filter form has lower computational complexity and provides a well-conditioned matrix inversion. To cope with fast time-varying channels, we introduce a new DFE coefficient computation algorithm which is obtained by incorporating the channel variation during the decision delay into the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. We refer to this as the non-Toeplitz DFE (NT-DFE). We also show the feasibility of a suboptimal receiver which has lower complexity than a recursive least squares adaptation, with performance close to the optimal NT-DFE.	adaptive equalizer;channel state information;coefficient;computation;computational complexity theory;condition number;dispersive partial differential equation;equalization (communications);feedforward neural network;matched filter;mean squared error;noise shaping;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;recursion;recursive least squares filter;toeplitz hash algorithm;windows nt	Heung-No Lee;Gregory J.

We next propose a precoder design to achieve this bound. However, such an optimal precoder requires channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) exclusive of the receiver array which cannot be separately estimated practically. A more feasible precoder design, which leverages on the feedback CSIT estimated at the receiver, is next proposed. Using the performance of the optimal precoder which achieves the bound asymptotically as a benchmark, the practical precoder design performs close to the optimal precoder even in the high-resolution scenario. Both precoder schemes exhibit performance improvement compared with the case when no precoder is used. & 2013 Elsevier B.V.

3d93364dbb0bead0a0beb7b21e6a3c55ab74c1ff	low-complexity two-way af relay design for millimeter wave communication systems		In this paper, we consider the problem of hybrid multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transceiver design for a non regenerative hybrid two-way amplify-forward (AF) relay based millimeter wave (mmWave) communication system. We propose two low complexity mmWave system designs based on the quality of available channel state information (CSI). We first propose the design of transceivers and a two- way AF relay, by minimizing sum-mean square error (SMSE) under the constraint of total relay transmit power while assuming the perfect channel knowledge. We later extend it to a robust design under the assumption that the transceivers posses only imperfect information about the channel state, where the CSI error is assumed to follow the Gaussian distribution. In both the designs, reduced hardware complexity (introduced due to large number of antenna elements in mmWave system) is achieved by analog-digital hybrid processing by using orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based sparse signal processing. We present numerical results on the performance of both the designs over various dictionaries. The comparison results show that robust design is resilient to the presence of CSI errors. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the convergence of both the proposed algorithms to a limit even though global convergence is hard to prove due to non convex nature of overall optimization problem.	algorithm;anisotropic filtering;central processing unit;channel state information;dictionary;filter design;local convergence;mimo;matching pursuit;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;numerical analysis;openmp;optimization problem;relay;signal processing;simulation;sparse matrix;transceiver	Deepa Jagyasi;P.

For the hybrid designs, zero forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) linear receivers are derived by a simple transformation. To improve error rate performance, we propose weighted soft decision Viterbi decoding by using the SINR of the transformed equivalent channel matrix. The proposed scheme can mitigate noise enhancement inherent to ZF and MMSE linear detectors.

Generally, relay selection algorithms require channel state information (CSI) feedback from all cooperating relays to make a selection decision. This requirement poses two important challenges, which are often neglected in the literature. Firstly, the fed back channel information is usually corrupted by additive noise. Secondly, CSI feedback generates a great deal of feedback overhead (air-time) that could result in significant performance hits. In this paper, we propose a compressive sensing (CS) based relay selection algorithm that reduces the feedback overhead of relay networks under the assumption of noisy feedback channels. The proposed algorithm exploits CS to first obtain the identity of a set of relays with favorable channel conditions. Following that, the CSI of the identified relays is estimated using least squares estimation without any additional feedback. Both single and multiple relay selection cases are considered. After deriving closed-form expressions for the asymptotic end-to-end SNR at the destination and the feedback load for different relaying protocols, we show that CS-based selection drastically reduces the feedback load and achieves a rate close to that obtained by selection algorithms with dedicated error-free feedback.	additive white gaussian noise;backchannel;channel state information;compressed sensing;end-to-end principle;feedback;least squares;overhead (computing);relay;selection algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;utility functions on indivisible goods	Mohammed E.

20ee343b720c30cad476a471153397c7d8da8f69	improved spatially-coupled multiuser transmission via constellation rotation		Spatial coupling has been applied in multiple access system in order to obtain higher spectral efficiency, where different users share the same resource blocks by superimposing data streams with different time offsets. In this paper, we introduce constellation rotation into the spatially-coupled multiuser system to further distinguish users and mitigate the interferences. The optimization of the rotation angles is carried out by maximizing the average mutual information between the transmitted symbols and the received signal. Simulation results show that the constellation rotation generally contributes to the performance improvement of the system and reduces the decoding latency. Benefiting from the optimization, the system with the optimal rotation angle set clearly outperforms the others.	exit chart;mathematical optimization;multi-user;mutual information;simulation;spectral efficiency;x.690	Min Jiang;Zhongwei Si	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292763	real-time computing;latency (engineering);data stream mining;decoding methods;mutual information;performance improvement;computer science;transmission (mechanics);spectral efficiency	Arch	40.781731861475414	83.27638810678741	127203

The relay detects the packets received from all sources and performs Galois field network coding. We propose a simple cooperative maximum-ratio combining scheme for the destination which is shown to achieve the maximum diversity gain of the system. Furthermore, we provide a mathematical framework for the asymptotic analysis of NCCD systems with M-ary modulation for high signal-to-noise ratios. Based on this framework, we derive simple and elegant closed- form expressions for the asymptotic symbol and bit error rates which provide significant insight into the impact of various system and channel parameters on performance and can be exploited for performance optimization. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the presented analysis and show that large performance gains are possible by optimizing the power allocation in NCCD systems based on the developed analytical results.	bit error rate;mathematical optimization;modulation;performance tuning;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Amir Nasri;Robert Schober;Murat Uysal	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683200	galois theory;closed-form expression;linear network coding;asymptotic analysis;bit error rate;telecommunications;word error rate;computer science;phase-shift keying;theoretical computer science;mathematics;cooperative diversity;silicon;signal-to-noise ratio;finite field	HPC	39.87306353138717	75.77061294073488	127356

In this paper, algorithms for joint estimation of these parameters and channels in amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying networks are proposed. A new training model and transceiver structure at the relays for achieving synchronization throughout the network is devised. New exact closed-form expressions for the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the multi-parameter estimation problem are derived. An estimation method is proposed for jointly estimating MCFOs, MTOs, and channel gains at the destination based on space-alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) and compared to a computationally-intensive least squares (LS) approach. The proposed estimator's performance is shown to be close to the CRLB at mid-to-high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) resulting in significant cooperative performance gains in the presence of practical impairments.	anisotropic filtering;carrier frequency;estimation theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;least squares;relay;run time (program lifecycle phase);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;transceiver	Ali Arshad Nasir;Hani Mehrpouyan;Steven D.

8be64451662fd014f69901aa4b5ffc109bda6f1e	transmit waveform/receive filter design for mimo radar with multiple waveform constraints		In this paper, we consider the joint design of both transmit waveforms and receive filters for a colocated multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar with the existence of signal-dependent interference and white noise. The design problem is formulated into a maximization of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), including various constraints on the transmit waveforms. Compared with the traditional alternating semidefinite relaxation approach, a general and flexible algorithm is proposed based on the majorization-minimization method with guaranteed monotonicity, lower computational complexity per iteration and/or convergence to a B-stationary point. Many waveform constraints can be flexibly incorporated into the algorithm with only a few modifications. Furthermore, the connection between the proposed algorithm and the alternating optimization approach is revealed. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated via numerical experiments in terms of SINR performance, ambiguity function, computational time, and properties of the designed waveforms. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithms are faster in terms of running time and meanwhile achieve as good SINR performance as the the existing methods.	ambiguity function;colocation centre;computational complexity theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;filter design;interference (communication);iteration;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;mimo;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;stationary process;time complexity;waveform;white noise	Linlong Wu;Prabhu Babu;Daniel Pérez Palomar	2018	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2017.2787115	mimo;mathematical optimization;control theory;white noise;mathematics;algorithm design;computational complexity theory;filter design;ambiguity function;waveform;signal-to-noise ratio	EDA	50.721836197871134	82.42573846620698	127405

A network sensing scenario comprising low-end sensors is considered, with each sensor reporting a single randomly filtered power measurement bit to the fusion center (FC), which estimates the ambient power spectrum from these bits. An adaptive thresholding algorithm is proposed to improve the quality and speed of power spectrum reconstruction. Upon receipt of each new bit, the FC picks the threshold for the next sensor so as to cut off a half-space from the feasible region along its Chebyshev center. Convergence of this algorithm to the true finite-length autocorrelation is shown, whose Fourier transform yields the power spectrum estimate. To avoid the `downlink' threshold communication overhead, an alternative algorithm is proposed, where each sensor pseudo-randomly chooses its threshold from a suitable distribution, and the FC judiciously polls sensors to form its power spectrum estimate.	algorithm;autocorrelation;chebyshev center;cognitive radio;feasible region;overhead (computing);pseudorandomness;randomness;sensor;spectral density;telecommunications link;thresholding (image processing)	Omar Mehanna;Nikos D.

d08aeea6e0015ac878c498065ef4628fb021e23f	a novel mirror-aided non-imaging receiver for indoor $2\times 2$ mimo-visible light communication systems		Indoor visible light communication (VLC) systems are now possible because of advances in light emitting diode and laser diode technologies. These lighting technologies provide the foundation for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) data transmission through visible light. However, the channel matrix can be strongly correlated in indoor MIMO-VLC systems, preventing parallel data streams from being decoded. Here, in  $2\times 2$  MIMO-VLC systems, we describe a mirror diversity receiver (MDR) design that reduces the channel correlation by both blocking the reception of light from one specific direction and improving the channel gain from light from another direction by utilizing a double-sided mirror deployed between the receiver’s photodetectors. We report on the channel capacity of the MDR system and the optimal height of its mirrors in terms of maximum channel capacity. We also derived analytic results on the effect of rotation on MDR’s performance. Based on numerical and experimental results, we show that the double-sided mirror has both constructive and destructive effects on the channel matrix. Our design can be used with previously described non-imaging systems to improve the performance of indoor VLC systems.	blocking (computing);channel capacity;diode;mimo;memory data register;numerical analysis;vlc media player	Ki-Hong Park;Hassan Makine Oubei;Wael G.

A practical cooperation strategy is provided to facilitate the time-frequency-space diversity for the coded single carrier frequency division multiple access system over frequency-selective Rayleigh block fading channels. To take advantage of the time-frequency dispersion and to facilitate the space diversity through cooperation, each user transmits his partner's and his own interleaved data on different subcarriers spreading over the entire available bandwidth. The allocation of subcarriers to each user and his partners can be either pre-specified or dynamically determined.

Orthogonality between the test beams is typically chosen to aid subsequent interference-free transmission to the corresponding terminals. However, much of this work assumes that i) the pool of terminals on a given time-frequency resource is large enough that a subset of terminals can be found whose spatial signatures match the orthogonal test beams; ii) the responses to the test beams of the entire pool are known to the base station; iii) beamforming considerations can drive traffic scheduling and resource allocation. These conditions are not always met. Rather, we examine orthogonalizing a given set of data-carrying beams for terminals that are scheduled on distinct time-frequency resources. The scheduled terminals are not chosen for their spatial signatures, but rather for their need to receive data. Our orthogonalization is chosen to maximize the beamforming gain to the scheduled terminals, whose channels are generally not spatially orthogonal. Unscheduled terminals may then ldquoeavesdroprdquo on pilots embedded in the orthogonal beams and thereby learn their own channel state information. This process eliminates the need for separate dedicated orthogonal training signals. We show how this scheme may be deployed in frequency-division duplex and time-division duplex systems. We quantify the price in beamforming gain paid for orthogonalizing a set of beams. One result analytically shows that the average price is at most 1.4 dB in SNR.	beamforming;channel state information;decibel;duplex (telecommunications);electronic signature;embedded system;interference (communication);multi-user;scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;type signature	Bertrand M.

By making different assumptions on the availability of the timing and frequency offset at the secondary user, we derive two algorithms based on likelihood ratio test and generalized likelihood ratio test, respectively and theoretically obtain the detection performances of them. The proposed algorithms jointly utilize energy of observations and correlation of the cyclic prefix (CP) data. The extensive simulations show that the two algorithms outperform the other CP-based methods, perform well at very low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and are robust to the CP ratio.

ce47422b187186919f3a38a73a88be5b432bbfec	downlink precoder and equalizer designs for multi-user mimo fbmc/oqam		In this contribution we propose two new iterative precoder and equalizer designs for the Downlink (DL) scenario of Multi-User (MU)-MIMO systems which employ Filter Bank based Multi-Carrier (FBMC) with Offset-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (O-QAM). In a MU-MIMO DL scenario, we must design our per-subcarrier filters to compensate the inter-symbol and intercarrier interference (ISI and ICI) present in an FBMC/OQAM system in addition to multi-user interference (MUI). The first method presented takes advantage of the Mean Squared Error (MSE)-duality to design Minimum MSE (MMSE)-based precoders and equalizers. The second method looks at maximizing the Signal-to-Leakage Ratio (SLR) in the transmitter and the Signalto-Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) in the receiver. Through numerical simulations we will evaluate the performance of these methods and compare them to recent approaches found in the literature.	algorithm;computer simulation;converge;equalization (communications);filter bank;ici (programming language);interference (communication);iterative method;magic user interface;mean squared error;modulation;multi-user mimo;numerical analysis;slr grammar;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral leakage;subcarrier;telecommunications link;transmitter;x.690	Oliver De Candido;Sher Ali Cheema;Leonardo Gomes Baltar;Martin Haardt;Josef A.

In order to combat this limitation, we propose a direct-code for SSK (DC-SSK) modulation technique. In DC-SSK, the transmitter is allowed to use 0,1,..., Nt antennas for each symbol, and groups of Nt bits are used to derive the transmitting antennas directly according to the bit value, active for `1' and inactive for `0'. DC-SSK improves the spectral efficiency by exploiting the indices of both the active and inactive antennas to convey the information. The analysis shows that the data rate of DC-SSK increases linearly with the number of transmitting antennas, while the data rate of conventional SSK increases as a base-2 logarithm. To keep the transmit side simple, we propose an on-off keying modulation, instead of generalized QAM. We analyze the performance of the proposed solution and validate the results by simulation. The results show that the DC-SSK is a promising solution for the next generation of wireless communications, as a response to the massive demand for increased data rates.	binary logarithm;data rate units;key (cryptography);modulation;next-generation network;on-off keying;simulation;spectral efficiency;transmitter	Nafel N.

A typical spread-spectrum IR that employs a matched-filter sum for bit decisions is susceptible to small numbers of large power pulses that can dominate the bit decision-threshold statistics. This letter describes a technique for chip discrimination prior to the spreading summation, that can greatly reduce the effects of large near-far power ratios among interferers. The technique exploits the very narrow pulsewidth and resulting low-duty-cycle characteristic only achievable with ultra-wide bandwidth. A statistical model is developed that predicts bit-error performance for binary offset pulse position modulation as a function of near-far density and power for varying discrimination thresholds. An analytic solution for perfect chip blanking is developed, and is in good agreement with chip discrimination for large near-far power ratios. We find that even a small number of very near interferers can greatly reduce the performance of a system without blanking or discrimination. Results show substantial improvement using this method for near interferers with near-far power ratios greater than 20 dB.	duty cycle;ewald summation;interference (communication);matched filter;modulation;simulation;statistical model;ultra-wideband;x.690	William M.

In this paper, we study the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing, in terms of the system probability of detection, when the secondary users' local decisions are correlated. We use a correlation model that is indexed by a single parameter and fix the fusion rule to one of three decision rules which are the OR, AND and Majority Voting rules. Our results show that the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing degrades with the increase in correlation between the secondary observations for all the fusion rules considered. We also show that, whether the OR or Majority Voting rule is superior depends mainly on the correlation index. When the secondary users' local decisions are independent, the Majority Voting rule outperforms the OR and AND fusion rules. However, as the correlation between the local decisions increases, the OR fusion rule outperforms the other two rules. Also, as the correlation index increases, for the same system probability of false alarm, higher signal-to-noise ratio is required to be received at the secondary users to achieve the same system probability of detection for all the fusion rules considered.	cognitive radio;rule 90;signal-to-noise ratio	Lamiaa Khalid;Alagan Anpalagan	2011	2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140040	cognitive radio;computer science;machine learning;data mining;computer security;statistics	Mobile	47.852963620540585	87.65272133931246	128439
d8bf31628f2402f38a1b9420cb6a12df92b44d6c	joint estimation of toa and data symbols in uwb communication in presence of impulsive interference		Ultra-wide band (UWB) ranging requires precise estimation of time-of-arrival (ToA) of first path (FP) signal. In UWB communication, estimation of ToA is challenging in the presence of impulsive interference and multipath. Generally in literature, ToA is estimated using threshold crossing techniques. Although threshold based ToA methods are simple, optimal threshold value is hard to determine in practice. In this paper, we propose joint estimation of ToA and data symbols by exploiting the cluster-sparsity of the received UWB signal in the presence of impulsive interference. The proposed receiver structure enhances the signal-to- noise ratio at the receiver output by mitigating the impulsive interference and barring inter-clusters noise accumulation. The proposed method is also free from any threshold, training, and optimization process. Robustness of the proposed algorithm is validated for standardized IEEE 802.15.4a channel models in the presence of both additive white Gaussian noise and impulsive interference.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multipath propagation;sparse matrix;tree accumulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Sanjeev Sharma;Anubha Gupta;Vimal Bhatia	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8253935	multipath propagation;real-time computing;robustness (computer science);additive white gaussian noise;interference (wave propagation);computer science;ranging;control theory;signal-to-noise ratio;communication channel	Visualization	50.64947046867516	79.39869369895548	128473

In this correspondence, however, we show that when MIMO channels experience single-keyhole conditions, the effect of spatial correlations between transmission antennas is more sophisticated for general STCs: When M > N (i.e., the number of transmission antennas is greater than the number of receiving antennas), depending on how the correlation matrix P beamforms the codeword difference matrix Δ, the pairwise error probability performance of general STCs can be either degraded or improved in high-SNR regimes. We provide a new measure, which is based on the eigenvalues of Δ and the numbers of transmission and receiving antennas, to examine if there exist certain correlation matrices that can improve the performance of general STCs in high-SNR regimes. Previous studies on the effect of spatial correlations over single-keyhole channels only concentrated on orthogonal STCs, whereas our study here is for general STCs and can also be used to explain previous findings for orthogonal STCs. Simulations also show that the results are applicable with imperfect channel knowledge.	code word;computer simulation;existential quantification;mimo;pairwise error probability;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Chen He;Xun Chen;Z.

In this paper, we propose a constant rate adaptive modulation with selection transmit diversity for broadband OFDM wireless systems. By combining the adaptive modulation with the adaptive selection diversity according to the characteristics of the channel on each sub-carrier, the transmit diversity obtained by antenna selection is further maximized through adaptive bit assignment and power assignment on each sub-carrier under the constraint of power and overall bit rate. As a result, the proposed system can achieve better performance compared to that of the conventional selection transmit diversity based OFDM systems without adaptive modulation and conventional adaptive modulation based OFDM systems without selection transmit diversity over multipath fading channels.	modulation	Yonghong Qiu;Ya-Han Pan;Zhigang Cao;Khaled Ben Letaief	2003		10.1109/PIMRC.2003.1264368	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;quality of service;link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;diversity scheme;pulse-position modulation;transmit diversity;fading;computer network	Mobile	43.20279343179748	81.55192020547214	128989

The MUD considered is an iterative receiver which utilizes the soft information to refine the estimation of the interference to enhance the interference cancellation capability. More specifically, users with different transmission rates are classified into separate groups and, in each iteration, these groups of users are detected sequentially based on a set of minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) group detectors with the removal of multiple access interferences (MAI) group by group. Furthermore, the estimated interferences in each group, either from the same or the other groups, are refined successively with the assistance of the soft information in the symbol detection process. Conducted simulations show that the proposed MUD, with moderate computational overhead, can effectively suppress the MAI to render superior performance compared with previous works.	computation;data rate units;filter bank;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);iteration;mud;mean squared error;multi-user;national supercomputer centre in sweden;overhead (computing);sql;sensor;simulation;telecommunications link;zero suppression	Yung-Ping Tu;Wen-Hsien Fang;Hoang-Yang Lu;Yie-Tarng Chen	2008	VTC Spring 2008 - IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2008.156	minimum mean square error;code division multiple access;detector;single antenna interference cancellation;electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;iterative method;computational complexity theory;computational model;intersymbol interference	Mobile	47.416268073544686	77.56725132682627	129040

To enable this new paradigm, fast and accurate spectrum sensing has to be performed over very wide bandwidth in noisy channel environments under energy constraints. Cyclic feature based sensing approach works well under noise uncertainty, but requires very high sampling rates in the wideband regime, and hence incurs high energy consumption and hardware costs. This paper aims to alleviate the sampling requirements of cyclic detectors by utilizing the compressive sampling principle and exploiting the sparsity structure in the two-dimensional cyclic spectrum domain. A technical challenge lies in the fact that the compressive samples collected in the time domain does not have a direct linear relationship with the two dimensional sparse cyclic spectrum of interest, which is a major departure from existing sparse signal recovery techniques for linear sampling systems. This paper solves this challenge by reformulating the vectorized cyclic spectrum into a linear form of the autocorrelation of the compressed samples. Further, based on the recovered cyclic spectrum, new cyclic-based detectors are developed to estimate the spectrum occupancy when multiple sources are present. Simulation shows that the proposed spectrum sensing algorithms can substantially reduce sampling rate with little performance loss, and is robust to the unpredictable noise uncertainty in wireless networks.	algorithm;autocorrelation;compressed sensing;detection theory;gibbs sampling;noisy-channel coding theorem;programming paradigm;requirement;sampling (signal processing);sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sparse matrix;thresholding (image processing)	Zhi Tian	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5963015	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	51.663462569177526	84.14613005635697	129070

Simulation results validating the proposed algorithm are given for various test cases. Further, the accuracy of estimation of RS code parameters using the proposed algorithm is also evaluated for various M−ary quadrature amplitude modulation schemes. From the simulation results, it is observed that the accuracy of estimation improves with a decrease in code dimension and modulation order and the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms in the prior works.	algorithm;angular defect;computer programming;estimation theory;modulation;reed–solomon error correction;simulation;test case	R.

With an emphasis on a preamble design for multichannel separation, we address a channel estimation based on the time-domain windowing and its imperfectness in the space-time block-coded (STBC) OFDM-CDMA systems, respectively. Also, for a simple construction of the OFDM-CDMA system with the low peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) and reduced transmitter complexity, we investigate a simple PAR reduction scheme and its combination with both decimated selective mapping (SLM) and partial transmit sequence (PTS) methods. Taking into account the false side information introduced by the PAR reduction scheme, the effects of diversity techniques and PAR on the performance of the STBC OFDM-CDMA system are investigated and the maximum achievable diversity gain for a two-path Rayleigh-fading environment is evaluated. From the presented results, we find that the OFDM-CDMA signal with the low PAR is easily constructed by a simple phase transform and its combination version with the SLM and PTS approaches can be implemented to be less complex by decimating the OFDM samples. At the same time, the OFDM-CDMA system applying a space-time-frequency diversity with two and four transmit antennas can give the diversity of D=4 and D=8 for the multiuser case with half user capacity, respectively, even if encountered with the false side information.	access network;channel state information;digital video broadcasting;itil;mimo-ofdm;multi-user;pts-dos;performance evaluation;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;spatial light modulator;terrestrial television;transmitter;wavelength-division multiplexing	Young-Hwan You;Wongi Jeon;Jong-Ho Paik;Mi-Jeong Kim;Dong-Sun Kim;Hyoung-Kyu Song	2005	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2004.838824	block code;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering	Mobile	44.08081262777618	79.14261743986037	129214
7f4aad4b6456ab7b6461a67a5a6a9ffa0d568f12	sinr prediction versus reverse reporting for soft reuse and interference management	interference signal to noise ratio receivers transmitters protocols	We investigate inter-cell interference management based on two methods: instantaneous signal-to-interference plus noise (SINR) prediction and reverse reporting. Reverse reporting, a concept where vulnerable receivers announce themselves, is a common approach. SINR prediction is an alternative solution which brings the decision responsibility to the receiver. This has a positive effect on the system performance as receiver has more crucial information at its disposal than the transmitter. The paper proposes a protocol with both SINR prediction and reverse reporting as interference management phases implemented by sounding the channel with orthogonal sequences, but focuses mainly on situations when only one of them is active. We simulate the two approaches in WINNER based indoor scenario and compare them in terms of spectral efficiency and user fairness. SINR prediction comes out superior as it achieves significantly higher spectral efficiency for the price of only small decrease in fairness.	interference (communication);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Michal Cierny;Cássio B.

Knowing that the optimal design has an exponential complexity which hinders the practicability, a reduced complexity approach is proposed. This approach keeps the existing channel estimation and decoding schemes almost intact, while applying the turbo or iterative processing principle to enable information exchange between them. Thus the complexity is rendered linear; and the filter adaptability can be easily established. We apply this approach to two commonly used modulation schemes for noncoherent detection, namely, pilot symbol assisted modulation (PSAM) and differential modulation, with the intention to overcome certain disadvantages seen in their demodulation. It turns out that the performance is improved and the robustness is enhanced. In this paper, we first give the system descriptions of the two applications. Their performances are then simulated and compared with the existing systems. To reveal the tradeoffs in practical applications, the two new designs are also compared with each other in terms of throughput, complexity, performance, and robustness.	model-driven engineering	Hsuan-Jung Su;Evaggelos Geraniotis	1999		10.1109/WCNC.1999.796999	adaptive filter;turbo code;throughput;convolutional code;information exchange;channel code;link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;optimal design;theoretical computer science;demodulation;estimation theory;computational complexity theory;signal-to-noise ratio;fading;statistics;robustness	Logic	47.9549333528535	76.69265845770899	129293

These results are very useful for performance evaluation of diversity systems without bit-level simulations. The results can also provide very useful characteristics such as average duration of fades, fading rate and outage probability for two-channel diversity systems and can be extended to multiple fading channels. Performance of diversity systems is often evaluated under the assumption of perfect interleaving and characterised in terms of long-term parameters such as the average bit-error rate, which does not capture the dynamics of fading channels. Statistical characteristics (static and dynamic) of the envelope of two correlated Rayleigh fading channels are explored using a physical model. For two popular diversity-combining schemes, maximal ratio combining and selection combining, both static and dynamic (level-crossing rate) properties of correlated fading channels are derived. These results are very useful for performance evaluation of diversity systems without bit-level simulations. The results can also provide very useful characteristics such as average duration of fades, fading rate and outage probability for two-channel diversity systems and can be extended to multiple fading channels.	bit error rate;bit-level parallelism;forward error correction;interval exchange transformation;maximal set;performance evaluation;rayleigh fading;simulation;sun outage	Wei Tang;Saleem A.

d204fcca8baa8442277bef21a524e96655a2fe53	performance evaluation of timing estimation technique using extended cyclic prefix for correlation sequence for ofdm systems	ofdm;sto;cfo;mle	This paper presents an analysis of symbol timing offset (STO) estimation method for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems. The proposed method does not require any preamble and with the use of available cyclic prefix (CP) samples we have proposed an extended CP. The extended CP is used to exploit more number of correlation products in correlation sequence so that a more accurate starting point of any symbol can be estimated. A simplified maximum likelihood estimation process for proposed timing estimation technique is given which enables us much more accurate timing estimate due to decreased error variance. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of mean square error of timing estimator against different signal to noise ratio values and in terms of error distribution of the estimators with and without the effect of carrier frequency offset in various channel scenarios such as AWGN, HIPERLAN/2A and HIPERLAN/2E. Simulation results shows that proposed method has significantly better performance compared to the CP based method for STO estimation.	performance evaluation	Sandeep Shukla;Vijay Shanker Tripathi	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-017-4553-0	real-time computing;computer science;carrier frequency offset;estimator;cyclic prefix;additive white gaussian noise;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;mean squared error;signal-to-noise ratio;hiperlan	Embedded	50.642408519015845	77.57862781977153	129736

In the current deployments small cells coexist with their respective macro cells in the same spectrum, due to the difficulty and costs involved in acquiring new spectrum licenses. This leads to considerable interference between the two systems. In this context, we propose an underlay cognitive interference alignment technique to remove the interference from the small cell to the macro cell system. In the proposed scheme the small cells sense the unused resources in the space dimension of the macro cell, i.e. its null space, and precode their signals such that they lie in the sensed null space. We demonstrate that only the sign of the null space components is necessary to obtain close to full null space information performance. This results in less overhead in the sensing process making the system more efficient and practically feasible.	coexist (image);interference (communication);kernel (linear algebra);overhead (computing);requirement	Daniel Castanheira;Atílio Gameiro;Adão Silva	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666366	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;zero-forcing precoding;mathematics;co-channel interference;precoding;computer network	Arch	40.60832764562582	86.39413125339132	129739

Due to the format of transmission, the channel affects the signal only at discrete frequencies, and hence single-tap equalization is usually deemed sufficient. In this paper the selection of an efficient algorithm for equalization and its implementation is reported for indoor WPAN applications based on the ECMA-368/9 standard. The observed deficiency of interpolation techniques is explained and alternative algorithms are suggested. The algorithm with the best tradeoff between performance and resource utilization (area etc) is implemented in Verilog and simulated in Cadence IUS for correctness with success.	algorithm;angular defect;correctness (computer science);interpolation;ultra-wideband;verilog	Arkosnato Neogy;Tuhin Subhra Chakraborty;Saswat Chakrabarti	2010	International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems	10.1109/ICUMT.2010.5676477	real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science	EDA	51.93944002405633	77.92431493983997	129755

The proposed algorithm is able to recover the transmitted data even when the channel changes on a symbol-by-symbol basis, making it suitable for fast fading channels. The proposed algorithm does not require any statistical information about the channel and thus does not suffer from latency normally associated with blind methods. The paper demonstrates how to reduce the complexity of the algorithm, which becomes especially low at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Specifically, it is shown that in the high SNR regime, the number of operations is of the order O(LN), where L is the cyclic prefix length and N is the total number of subcarriers.

Capacity or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) optimal AS has been considered to require an exhaustive search among all possible antenna subsets. In this work, we prove that, under a total power constraint on the beamformer, the maximum-SNR joint beamforming transmit AS problem with two receive antennas and an arbitrary number of transmit antennas N is polynomially solvable and develop an algorithm that solves it with quartic complexity, independently of the number of selected antennas. The algorithm identifies with complexity O(N4) a cubic-size collection of antenna subsets that contains the one that maximizes the post-processing receiver SNR. From a different perspective, for any given two-row complex matrix, our algorithm computes with quartic complexity its two-row submatrix with the maximum principal singular value, for any number of selected columns. In addition, our method also applies to receive AS with two transmit antennas. Finally, if we enforce a per-antenna-element power constraint on the beamformer (i.e., constant-envelope transmission), then the set of transmit AS subsets that contains the optimal one is the same as in the total power constraint case. Therefore, our algorithm offers a practical solution to the maximum-SNR antenna selection problem when either the transmitter or the receiver consists of a large number of antennas.	beamforming;brute-force search;column (database);cubic function;decision problem;mimo;mobile phone;radio frequency;selection algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;time complexity;transmitter;video post-processing	Maria Gkizeli;George N.

It provides better trade-offs between complexity and performance, especially in large-scale MIMO systems. It also achieves better bit error rate (BER) performance than known heuristic algorithms in large-scale MIMO literature, such as Local Ascent Search and Reactive Tabu Search algorithms, especially at higher-order modulations. This algorithm improves the performance of the conventional QP detectors using two stages of QP with the concept of interference cancellation and also with the concept of shadow area constraints as a measure of symbols reliability. Thus, we call it a Two-stage quadratic programming detector. Computer simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in large-scale MIMO systems for both uncoded and turbo coded cases.	bit error rate;heuristic;interference (communication);mimo;modulation;quadratic programming;search algorithm;sensor;simulation;tabu search;x.690	Ali A.

In this paper, we first investigate the channel estimation performance for the polynomial interpolation, which takes into account the impact of modeling mismatch and thermal noise. This is then followed by a novel sub- optimum pilot-placement scheme, which can considerably improve channel estimation and overall system performance for the consecutive chunks scenario, i.e., each user has several consecutive chunks along the frequency direction.	channel state information;chunking (computing);johnson–nyquist noise;polynomial interpolation;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link	Hongju Liu;Yi Ma;Rahim Tafazolli	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394519	real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;interpolation;polynomial interpolation;computer science;noise;computer performance;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	47.72704705906729	81.23416110528612	130836

The proposed receiver involves the following stages. First, the fuzzy CFO constrained MOE detector after coarse CFO estimation is proposed to suppress multiple access interference and combat the degradation problem of the conventional MOE detector caused by the CFO effect. Next, using the signal subspace projection technique, the proposed detector can further reduce the enhanced noise due to the fuzzy CFO constrained detector. Finally, the output data obtained from these detectors are coherently combined to offer multipath diversity gain in accordance with the maximum ratio combining criterion. Furthermore, the proposed single input single output (SISO) robust detector can be easily extended for a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) MC-CDMA system with a high rate of performance. Simulation results show that the proposed SISO detector, which offers a similar performance as the optimal detector, can provide robustness against CFO and outperform the conventional detectors. The proposed MIMO detector with spatial multiplexing gain also exhibits excellent performance.	carrier frequency;moe;multipath propagation;telecommunications link	Juinn-Horng Deng;Tsui-Tsai Lin;Shu-Min Liao	2012	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-011-0271-1	telecommunications;control theory	Mobile	47.232386700932274	82.66357041395699	130887

In particular, we consider a type of beamforming with a maximum ratio transmission, maximum ratio combining (MRT-MRC) transceiver structure. For this system we derive a central limit theorem for various block-based performance metrics. This motivates an accurate Gaussian approximation to the system data rate and the number of outages per OFDM block. In addition to data rate and outage distributions, we also consider the subcarrier SNR as a random process in the frequency domain and compute level crossing rates (LCRs) and average fade bandwidths (AFBs). Hence, we provide fundamental but novel results for the MIMO OFDM channel. The accuracy of these results is verified by Monte Carlo simulations, and applications to both performance analysis and system design are discussed.	approximation;beamforming;data rate units;frequency divider;mimo;mrc (file format);modulation;monte carlo method;multiplexing;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;stochastic process;subcarrier;sun outage;systems design;transceiver	Krishna P.

To overcome the complexity and costs of complete frame-TDD boundary synchronization in the network, a combined channel assignment (CA) and antenna array (AA) approach is proposed to mitigate interference. First a rotated-interleaved CA (RICA) scheme is applied, which exploits sector antenna directivity to reject the majority of interferers by receiving them through the antenna side and back lobes. Combined with RICA, an AA system is used in the base station side to further reduce intersector interference during both transmission and reception phases. For the worst-case interference scenario an unsynchronized TDD scheme, the proposed methodology achieves a 51.5% improvement in the average channel capacity while it considerably improves the uplink availability. An advantage of this approach is that it considers only low-complexity AA system configurations, thereby optimizing the corresponding cost	access network;best, worst and average case;channel capacity;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);smart antenna;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;test-driven development	Konstantinos Ntagkounakis;Panos Dallas;Bayan S.

Due to the detailed search mechanism, the maximum likelihood (ML) MUD that provides optimal performance is limited to a dramatically increased computational complexity. The QR decomposition with M-algorithm maximum likelihood detection (QRM-MLD) MUD reduces the computational complexity compare with the computational complexity of ML MUD. The minimum mean squared error (MMSE) MUD with low complexity exhibit poor performance. MMSE-successive interference cancellation (SIC) MUD with almost the same complexity provides better bit error rate (BER) performance than linear MMSE MUD. In this paper, Hybrid QRM-MLD-MMSE with SIC adaptive multiuser detection has been proposed for signal detection. The simulation results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the complexity of the system and controls the BER performance of the system at the desired level.	algorithm;bell laboratories layered space-time;bit error rate;computational complexity theory;detection theory;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;mud;mean squared error;multi-user;multiplexing;qr decomposition;simplified instructional computer;simulation;standard database management analysis;x.690	Ugur Yesilyurt	2018	2018 26th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2018.8404415	multiuser detection;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;computer science;qr decomposition;single antenna interference cancellation;signal-to-noise ratio;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;bit error rate;electronic engineering;space-division multiple access;minimum mean square error	HPC	47.36887139842644	77.18736718396003	131308

Two types of carrier-sensing errors, i.e., false alarm and miss-detection, are considered, and their impact on the system performance is analyzed using a new CSMA/CA model based on a Markov chain capturing the sensing error at the physical layer. The system throughput and delay as functions of the sensing error probabilities, as well as other CSMA/CA parameters, are obtained, and their sensitivity with respect to a key physical-layer parameter, i.e., the sensing threshold, is analyzed for commonly used energy detectors or matched filters. It is shown that the throughput and delay sensitivity heavily depends on the ratio of the contention window size W to the frame length L, and the throughput is sensitive to the design of the sensing threshold when the ratio W/L is either small or large. The result provides guidelines about how to operate CSMA/CA considering imperfect sensing at the physical layer.	markov chain;matched filter;portable collision avoidance system;profiling (computer programming);sensor;throughput	Jo Woon Chong;Dan Keun Sung;Youngchul Sung	2010	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2009.2036927	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;computer performance;matched filter;statistics;computer network	Mobile	42.1255474601092	75.16066099245347	131377

What is common to frequency offset estimators, is that they only can give correct results within a certain range, up to the Nyquist frequency. This makes a difference especially in OFDM systems with pilots only at certain symbols, such as LTE. In this paper we present an algorithm where the Nyquist frequency is increased, up to the same value as if pilots were present in all OFDM symbols. The algorithm is based on using two or more frequency offset estimators, with lower, but different, Nyquist frequencies.	algorithm;compaq lte;decision boundary;frequency offset;latent class model;lookup table;nyquist frequency;sensor	Niklas Andgart;Fredrik Nordstrom	2010	2010 IEEE 72nd Vehicular Technology Conference - Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2010.5594449	nyquist frequency;aliasing;impulse invariance;frequency response;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;nyquist rate	EDA	50.902396347322664	78.1249630800288	131378

However, the overhead induced by polling CSIs of a large number of users can overshadow the multi-user diversity gain. In our previous work, a user identification approach (UIDA) was proposed to reduce the system overhead. In this paper, by allowing a small degree of outage to occur, we simplify the UIDA to reduce the overhead further, and present the throughput and outage analysis of the simplified UIDA over Rayleigh fading channels. Computer simulations based on IEEE 802.11a systems show that the simplified UIDA achieves considerable throughput improvement.	channel state information;downtime;mad;multi-user;overhead (computing);rayleigh fading;scheduling (computing);simulation;sun outage;throughput	Hang Li;Qinghua Guo;Yunxin Li;Defeng Huang	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6133748	computer simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;statistics;computer network	Mobile	42.19673278099012	82.23565765109781	131656

In particular, this scheme provides an uplink scale weight vector pre-weighting space-time block code (STBC) signals at each transmit sub-carrier in accordance to its space-time constellation, without utilizing the transmit channel state information (TCSI). A Bayes decision rule is adopted to generate the optimum weights using channel statistics measured from pilot sub-carriers cluster per OFDM symbol. Analytical expressions of the signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) improvement, based on the 2 × 2 MIMO-OFDM system model, are derived and discussed over spatially correlated fading channel. From our Monte Carlo simulations, the proposed scheme outperforms the Alamouti's detection in terms of the bit-error-rate (BER) performance with respect to various OFDM symbol size and pilot interval. The Doppler effect causes the inter-subcarrier-interference (ISI) are also taken into account. Hence, the derived analytical expressions of the SNR improvement are validated.	beamforming;bit error rate;block code;catastrophic interference;channel state information;doppler effect;eigen (c++ library);frequency divider;interference (communication);mimo;mimo-ofdm;monte carlo method;multiplexing;noise power;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;systems design;telecommunications link;x.690	John F.

The optimal maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) receiver is derived and a general suboptimal receiver to approximate the MLSD is proposed. The performance of the parallel interference cancellation (PIC) and decorrelating receivers is compared. The PIC receiver is demonstrated to achieve better performance in known channels than the decorrelating receiver, but it is observed to be more sensitive to the channel coefficient estimation errors than the decorrelator. At high channel loads the PIC receiver suffers from bit error rate (BER) saturation, whereas the decorrelating receiver does not. The performance of data-aided (DA) and decision-directed (DD) multiuser channel estimation is also compared. DA channel estimation is shown to be more robust than DD channel estimation, which may suffer from BER saturation caused by hangups at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR’s). The impact of channel estimation filter impulse response on the BER is studied by comparing optimal and suboptimal channel estimation filters. The implementation complexity of the decorrelating and PIC receivers is compared in terms of required floating point operations and clock cycles in a practical communication scenario. It is observed that the PIC receiver is only moderately more complex to implement than the conventional matched filter bank receiver, whereas the decorrelating receiver is significantly more complex.	approximation algorithm;bit error rate;channel state information;clock signal;coefficient;decorrelation;filter bank;interference (communication);matched filter;multi-user;pic microcontroller;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;x.690	Markku J.

The proposed estimators, which operate in the frequency-domain, use CORDIC (coordinate rotation digital computer) processors to achieve an efficient hardware implementation which is simpler than other computational intensive estimators based on processing in the time-domain. The hardware saving is twofold: the proposed implementation does not require complex cells such as multipliers or dividers; and some cells already existing in OFDM receivers for pay-load demodulation are reused during the synchronization phase. In addition, this paper also shows how to optimize the CORDIC cells, in terms of number of iterations, to provide a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to approximation error, and proposes an error propagation model for the proposed synchronization architecture	approximation error;cordic;central processing unit;computer;frequency divider;frequency offset;iteration;modulation;multiplexing;network packet;optimal design;propagation of uncertainty;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation	Joaquín Granado;Antonio Torralba;Jorge Chávez;Vicente Baena	2006	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2006.1706469	synchronization;electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio	Arch	51.15911683796544	77.94111559811081	132327

In the new scheme, two successive signal periods are put into one transmit duration to minimize the time-variant channel effect. The even and odd components of the transmitted waveforms are modulated into distinct Doppler frequencies in the azimuth direction and can be separated by bandpass filter in the range-Doppler domain. The presented STC scheme can suppress the interchannel ambiguous energy caused by the time-variant channel responses, which typically occur in conventional STC schemes, and increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the echoes by a decoding matrix. To further suppress the interference, a waveform called time and frequency comb-like chirp (TFCC) is proposed. With the application of the complementary comb-like structure in the time and frequency domains, two TFCC waveforms are short-term shift-orthogonal and constant envelope. Moreover, these corresponding TFCC waveforms can share the same antenna and time gate without sacrificing any TFCC waveforms’ peak level. The theoretical analysis and simulation results illustrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme.	chirp;doppler effect;interference (communication);mimo;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;synthetic data;waveform	Shangwen Liu;Zenghui Zhang;Wenxian Yu	2017	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing	10.1109/JSTSP.2016.2631945	synthetic aperture radar;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio;chirp;frequency domain	Mobile	48.87744274470268	81.51744318290302	132555

5ce1b8cfc7b94cb036e4d13df2ab949692576203	uplink signaling and receive beamforming for dual-function radar communications		Current techniques for dual-function radar-communications (DFRC) have been focused on downlink communication and information embedding into the emission of the radar system. In this paper, we consider the problem of half-duplex uplink communications in dual-function multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar communication systems. The DFRC system consists of a dual-function platform which functions as a MIMO radar during transmit mode and simultaneously receives and processes signals reflected from targets and uplink communication signals transmitted by a communication user. We propose a method for uplink signaling via forming a number of uplink beams carrying the same number of data symbols. Moreover, we employ non-adaptive and adaptive beamforming techniques at the radar receiver to separate the received communication signal from the target return even if they arrive from the same spatial angle. Cross-interference between the received communication and the reflected radar signals is mitigated using adaptive beamforming. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed uplink communication technique by numerical results.	adaptive beamformer;beamforming;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);mimo;numerical analysis;radar;telecommunications link	Aboulnasr Hassanien;Cenk Sahin;Justin G.

Many techniques are presented for multiuser detection but most of them are static, i.e. assuming time-invariant channel which is not the practical case. Some of the presented techniques are dynamic but their transfer function is linear which doesn't give the optimum or near optimum BER as required. This paper presents a dynamic multiuser detection technique based upon backpropagation neural networks using sigmoid transfer function. Simulation is performed to compare the proposed technique with other neural networks techniques and other static techniques. The simulation results show that the proposal causes BER enhancement over the considered techniques.	artificial neural network;backpropagation;code;dynamic logic (digital electronics);edge enhancement;intelligence amplification;multi-user;programming paradigm;sigmoid function;simulation;time-invariant system;transfer function;x.690	Mohamed M.

We start by deriving analytical expressions of the SIR for OFDM/OQAM systems, for two reception approaches: the multiplicative approach and the dispersive approach. The former approach, which is based on a multiplicative modelling of the channel, is the conventional reception way. The dispersive approach is based on matched filtering and provides an optimum reception in the presence of thermal noise. These expressions and other well known expressions of the SIR for conventional OFDM are then confirmed by simulation. Our results show that OFDM/OQAM systems, based on the IOTA waveform, provide better robustness to channel dispersions with respect to conventional OFDM systems.	dispersive partial differential equation;iota and jot;johnson–nyquist noise;performance;simulation;waveform	Amin Ben Salem;Mohamed Siala;Hatem Boujemaa	2005	2005 12th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ICECS.2005.4633472	electronic engineering;telecommunications;communication	EDA	43.8286315803674	77.43973995778589	132875

cc2bdca6ea324231426180ddb024fc2815be077e	beam-domain full-duplex massive mimo: realizing co-time co-frequency uplink and downlink transmission in the cellular system		Co-time co-frequency uplink and downlink (CCUD) transmission was considered challenging in the cellular system due to the strong self-interference (SI) between the transmitter and receiver of base station (BS). In this paper, by investigating the beam-domain representation of channels based on the basis expansion model, we propose a beam-domain full-duplex (BDFD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme to make the CCUD transmission possible. The key idea of the BDFD scheme lies in intelligently scheduling the uplink and downlink user equipment (UE) based on the beam-domain distributions of their associated channels to mitigate SI and enhance transmission efficiency. We show that the BDFD scheme achieves significant savings in uplink/downlink training resource and achieves uplink and downlink sum capacities simultaneously as the number of BS antennas approaches infinity. The superiority of the BDFD scheme over the traditional time-division duplex (TDD)/frequency-division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO is evaluated through simulation for the macrocell environment. The results show that the spectral efficiency gain can even exceed 2 $\times$ in the specific scenarios, since the BDFD scheme utilizes the time-frequency resource more efficiently in both the training and data transmission phases.	cooperative mimo;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);scheduling (computing);simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;transmitter	Xiaochen Xia;Kui Xu;Dongmei Zhang;Youyun Xu;Yurong Wang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2698160	user equipment;electronic engineering;mimo;computer network;macrocell;duplex (telecommunications);transmitter;telecommunications link;computer science;data transmission;spectral efficiency	Mobile	40.521337944684724	85.5105180858171	133132

Large pilot overhead is needed to estimate the numerous parameters of doubly-selective channel, resulting in low-spectral efficiency. In this paper, considering the correlation of practical wireless channels in high-dimensional signal spaces, a recursive channel estimation scheme based on compressed sensing (CS) is proposed for high-mobility OFDM systems to reduce the pilot overhead. Specifically, by exploiting the sparsity of OFDM channel in basis expansion model (BEM), the sparse BEM coefficients is estimated instead of numerous channel taps. Then we theoretically verify that the BEM coefficients corresponding successive OFDM symbols also share a common support. To utilize this temporal correlation of BEM coefficients, a recursive channel estimation algorithm derived from the classical modified CS algorithm is proposed to improve the present estimation by prior channel information from previous estimation. Theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed recursive channel estimation scheme preforms better than conventional schemes in various scenarios, even with less pilot overhead.	compressed sensing;recursion (computer science)	Kai Wang;Jingzhi Liu;Zhichun Gan;Bo Zhang	2018	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-017-5201-4	computer science;compressed sensing;fading;real-time computing;recursion;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;electronic engineering;communication channel;multiplexing	Mobile	50.22889304909021	80.28363972902004	133359

Channel estimation is important for wireless applications because, in practical transmission scenario, channel correlation functions are either not known or cannot be easily estimated. It is therefore desirable to have an estimator which is robust to mismatches between the assumed and the actual channel correlation functions. The wireless channel has fading characteristics and its time varying nature adds additional cost to estimator design. A simplified Kalman filter is proposed which reduces the noise effects of the least square estimation. While the Kalman filtering algorithm requires the noise process to be zero mean besides the requirement to know the standard deviation of the noise process, H-infinity filtering algorithm makes no assumption about the noise and hence is said to be more robust in the wake of uncertainty. The proposed channel estimation algorithm is more robust in terms of model uncertainty and is more suitable for OFDM systems. Further, the complexity of the H-infinity filter is not too high. Given the conditions, H-infinity poses a suitable filter than any other, for channel estimation.	best, worst and average case;channel state information;computer simulation;dmz (computing);electrical engineering;email;genetic algorithm;iteration;kalman filter;mimo;mike lesser;multiplexing;next-generation network;profiling (computer programming)	Joseph Gladwin Sekar;Salivahanan Sankarappan	2015	JCS	10.3844/jcssp.2015.400.405	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;channel state information;h-infinity methods in control theory;precoding;statistics;mimo;channel	Robotics	50.480607570037215	77.25051120595465	134056

Deliberately clipping the transmission signal degrades system performance, and clipping mitigation is required at the receiver for information restoration. In this paper, we acknowledge the sparse nature of the clipping signal and propose a low-complexity Bayesian clipping estimation scheme. The proposed scheme utilizes a priori information about the sparsity rate and noise variance for enhanced recovery. At the same time, the proposed scheme is robust against inaccurate estimates of the clipping signal statistics. The undistorted phase property of the clipped signal, as well as the clipping likelihood, is utilized for enhanced reconstruction. Furthermore, motivated by the nature of modern OFDM-based communication systems, we extend our clipping reconstruction approach to multiple antenna receivers and multi-user OFDM.We also address the problem of channel estimation from pilots contaminated by the clipping distortion. Numerical findings are presented that depict favorable results for the proposed scheme compared to the established sparse reconstruction schemes.	channel state information;circuit restoration;clipping (computer graphics);clipping (signal processing);distortion;frequency divider;mimo-ofdm;multi-user;multiplexing;numerical analysis;numerical method;power architecture platform reference;scheme;simulation;sparse matrix;wi-fi protected access	Anum Ali;Abdullatif Al-Rabah;Mudassir Masood;Tareq Y.

In this paper, a novel two-dimensional space-frequency domain redundancy based SFBC identification algorithm for frequency selective fading is proposed in which the detection probability varies with the number of subcarriers. In particular, space-domain redundancy is utilized to construct the cross-correlation function of the estimator while frequency-domain redundancy is incorporated in the hypothesis test statistic. Simulation results verify the viability of the proposed algorithm and its superior performance for short observation periods with comparable computational complexity to the conventional algorithms.	algorithm;code;coefficient;computational complexity theory;cross-correlation;field-programmable gate array;mimo-ofdm;modulation;noise power;real-time transcription;simulation;subcarrier	Mingjun Gao;Yongzhao Li;Litao Mao;Hailin Zhang;Naofal Al-Dhahir	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254792	estimator;real-time computing;fading;redundancy (engineering);block code;algorithm;statistic;statistical hypothesis testing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;computational complexity theory;computer science	EDA	50.61419975194915	77.55126211895616	134567

A novel adaptive joint nonlinear transmit-receive processing algorithm is proposed based on zero-forcing (ZF) criterion. In this algorithm, a block successive ZF precoding is first applied at the multiple base stations to pre-cancel partial multiuser interference. Then nonlinear Tomlinson-Harashima precoding is applied to further reduce interference between the data streams of other users and the other data streams of the same user, whereas linear equalization and modulo operation are applied at each user. We first show that the proposed joint nonlinear transmit-receive processing algorithm effectively decomposes the multiuser MIMO channel into parallel independent single-user MIMO channels. Different from the method in [1], our proposed algorithm allows the number of sub-channels of each user to be arbitrary number no more than the rank of that user's equivalent channel, and then for the given set of the numbers of sub-channels and the given power allocation of all users, closed-form expressions of the transmit and receive processing matrices are derived to optimize the output signal to interference plus noise ratio of each user. Subsequently, an adaptive method is proposed to adapt the number of sub-channels according to the fading of the users' channel matrices (termed as adaptive algorithm). Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves much better throughput performance than the processing methods in the literature, such as the non-adaptive nonlinear preprocessing algorithm in [1] and the known block diagonalization techniques.	adaptive algorithm;blu-ray;clozure cl;feedforward neural network;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;modulo operation;multi-user mimo;nonlinear system;preprocessor;signal integrity;signal processing;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Liang Sun;Ming Lei	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503703	3g mimo;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;mathematics;spatial multiplexing;precoding;mimo	HPC	39.76716136636693	86.01844227589223	134630

The reduced-complexity acquisition algorithm uses a received preamble that has been shortened by summing its elements group-by-group. Therefore, the performance deteriorates because it loses the impulsive autocorrelation property of the preamble after summation and correlation. In this paper, we design a preamble sequence with a sliding correlator output function that shows a distinct peak at zero delay and symmetry even after summation based on a flipping and doubly spreading concept. By comparing with other preamble sequences, we prove that the proposed preamble shows better timing acquisition performance in ultra-wideband channel environment.Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	ultra-wideband	Sung-Yoon Jung	2014	Int.

The key idea is to minimize the BER at the receivers directly by pre-distortion of the transmitted symbols. The BER can be predicted in the transmitter by calculating the signal at the receiver (including interference) exactly and treating only the additive noise at the receiver statistically. Using state-of-the-art nonlinear optimization methods like SQP (Sequential Quadratic Programming), the BER minimizing pre-distortion coefficients can be found. Simulations compare the proposed scheme with the RAKE matched filter and linear transmitter preprocessing schemes, like Joint Transmission. The proposed MUT scheme can be applied for instance in the 3GPP-TDD and the TD-SCDMA standards, where the channel impulse response is known in the transmitter due to channel reciprocity.	additive white gaussian noise;coefficient;computer simulation;distortion;interference (communication);matched filter;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;preprocessor;rake;sequential quadratic programming;test-driven development;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Ralf Irmer;Wolfgang Rave;Gerhard P.

fa446e7f8c89d7ea69435e5cce6b1854f9928b31	fast multi-symbol based iterative detectors for uwb communications	signal image and speech processing;quantum information technology spintronics	Ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radios have shown great potential in wireless local area networks for localization, coexistence with other services, and low probability of interception and detection. However, low transmission power and high multipath effect make the detection of UWB signals challenging. Recently, multi-symbol based detection has caught attention for UWB communications because it provides good performance and does not require explicit channel estimation. Most of the existing multi-symbol based methods incur a higher computational cost than can be afforded in the envisioned UWB systems. In this paper, we propose an iterative multi-symbol based method that has low complexity and provides near optimal performance. Our method uses only one initial symbol to start and applies a decision directed approach to iteratively update a filter template and information symbols. Simulations show that our method converges in only a few iterations (less than 5), and that when the number of symbols increases, the performance of our method approaches that of the ideal Rake receiver.	algorithmic efficiency;automatic target recognition;channel state information;coexist (image);computational complexity theory;computer simulation;decision theory;iteration;multipath propagation;rake;sensor;ultra-wideband;x.690	Qi Zhou;Xiaoli Ma;Vincenzo Lottici	2010	EURASIP J.

The proposed scheme can use only one receive antenna to detect the transmitted signals, whereas neither the transmitter nor the receiver knows the channel state information (CSI). Simulation results show that the bit error rate (BER) performance is nonidentical when different delay offsets are applied. The optimum delay offset for two transmit antennas system, for example, is about 0.6 TS (where Ts denotes symbol period) when the system achieves better performance.	blast;bit error rate;channel state information;modulation;multiplexing;simulation;transmitter;x.690	Defu Sun;Youxi Tang;Shihai Shao;Shaoqian Li	2007	Future Generation Communication and Networking (FGCN 2007)	10.1109/FGCN.2007.104	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	44.59073360131954	76.08185655307041	135085

In addition to cooperation, transmitting the same symbols through different sub carriers (Multi-Carriers) introduces frequency diversity as well. The objective of this paper is to investigate cooperative diversity performance in Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) systems with orthogonal and non-orthogonal spreading codes. We evaluate the Symbol Error Rate (SER) of cooperative transmission in frequency-selective Rayleigh faded uplink channel. We focus on the use of despreading-combining (DC) receiver and coherent detection with Maximal Ratio Combining for the above selected criteria respectively. It is shown that the orthogonal spreading code cancels Multiple-Access Interference (MAI) and the performance is completely independent of the length of the spreading code. The approximate SER derived here for the the transmission scheme is well matched with the increasing number of users in the system. Hence the Gaussian approximation is acceptable for systems which are operating with their maximum user capacities at lower SNR values.	rayleigh fading;relay	Udesh Oruthota;R. M. A. P.

6d1ef04fa31ab513d4595cdcc7261654aa5ffbb0	optimal multicell coordinated beamforming for downlink high-speed railway communications		This paper investigates the multicell coordinated beamforming (MCBF) design for high-speed railway communications, where a high-mobility train goes through a multicell multiuser system in urban areas. All passengers in the train are aggregated to be a high-mobility “big user.” In order to explore the downlink system performance limit, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the information rate from the serving base station to the high-mobility train while guaranteeing the minimal required achievable information rates of all low-mobility users outside the train by optimizing MCBF vectors. The interchannel interference (caused by Doppler effect to the train), the intercell interference and the interuser interference are jointly considered. Since the problem is nonconvex and cannot be solved directly, we first introduce an auxiliary variable (AV), and for a given AV, we find the optimal MCBF vectors via solving a second-order cone programming. Then, by updating the AV with the bisection method, the corresponding global optimal MCBF vectors are numerically obtained. Simulation results show that our proposed MCBF design greatly enhances the information throughput of the high-mobility train without degrading the required data rates of low-mobility users.	beamforming;bisection method;conic optimization;doppler effect;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-user;numerical analysis;optimization problem;second-order cone programming;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Yang Lu;Ke Xiong;Pingyi Fan;Zhangdui Zhong	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2714958	throughput;electronic engineering;computer science;telecommunications link;code rate;beamforming;bisection method;base station;optimization problem	Mobile	39.238846222001264	86.78129956614218	135234

We compare two classical beamforming strategies for the design of the beamforming vectors: maximum ratio combining precoding and partial zero-forcing. Since full channel state information at the transmission is unfeasible, we consider a limited feedback link and compare different strategies for bit partitioning of the feedback information for serving and interferer base stations. We propose a simple adaptive bit partitioning strategy to select an optimum transmission scheme at the base station. We show that the adaptive bit portioning algorithm is improved the sum capacity performance of the multicell networks significantly.	algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;interference (communication);telecommunications link	Berna Özbek;Didier Le Ruyet	2010	2010 7th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems	10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624536	telecommunications;computer science;base station;adaptive system;control theory	Arch	39.19516905570135	85.61369621334983	135333

By utilizing the recursive interference suppression and successive interference cancellation techniques, the symbol vector can be partitioned into many subgroups. Subsequently, symbols in each subgroup are detected in terms of the K-best detector. The inter-group interference is effectively mitigated in the GAIL algorithm by creating a candidate list and iteratively correcting the unreliable symbols for the detection result. We provide the performance-complexity tradeoff based on different feasible parameter settings. The numerical results demonstrate that the GAIL algorithm can achieve close-to-optimal performance while maintaining low computational complexity. In addition, the running speed of the GAIL algorithm can be dramatically increased using parallel processing in real-time communication systems.	algorithm;bell laboratories layered space-time;computational complexity theory;interference (communication);iterative method;mimo;numerical analysis;parallel computing;real-time clock;recursion;zero suppression	Changle Jing;Jun Xiong;Xin Wang;Jibo Wei;Yantao Guo	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2607222	single antenna interference cancellation;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;computational complexity theory;statistics;mimo	Metrics	47.50396887303211	78.06703015785908	135367

The inherent cyclic prefix (CP) of the DVB-T symbol is used for CFO estimation. By means of simulations, the proposed coarse timing method shows excellent robustness even at a very low SNR for the continuous transmission mode, and is also suitable for burst mode. In addition, the performance of the designed CFO estimator is close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound, increases for increasing delay of multipath spread and the number of receive antennas, and also performs as expected with timing estimation errors, which all agree well with the theoretical results	burst mode (computing);carrier frequency offset;carrier recovery;data structure;digital video broadcasting;embedded system;frequency divider;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multipath propagation;multiplexing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Chenyu Huang;William John Misskey;Joe Toth	2006	2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering	10.1109/CCECE.2006.277549	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;control theory;maximum likelihood;statistics	EDA	50.24999483251248	78.16817677187215	135654
12d1861f1953d9a771577b45ebe7898420d275bd	a unified view of diversity in multiantenna-multicarrier systems: analysis and adaptation strategies	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;communications engineering networks	Multicarrier and multiple transmit/receive antenna have become two key technologies underpinning most of the current development and research efforts towards ubiquitous high-throughput wireless communications. Both techniques can be used to increase the link throughput and/or to improve its robustness against channel fading and noise. This paper presents a unified bit error rate analysis for a particular flavour of multicarrier, namely, group-orthogonal code-division multiplex (GO-CDM), in combination with multiple Tx/Rx antennas. This system can be shown to encompass many of current wireless architectures and the analysis is general enough to incorporate the effects of channel frequency selectivity and Tx and/or Rx antenna correlation. The first main outcome of this paper is a general analytical framework suitable to study the effects of the different types of diversity in multicarrier systems. This analytical framework paves the way for the second main outcome of this study, namely, the design of effective reconfiguration strategies that serve to balance different system requirements (e.g., performance, complexity, delay). Particularly, it will be seen that the analytical results not only allows a-priori design decisions to be made, but it also provides an insight that enables the derivation of dynamic reconfiguration strategies that take into account instantaneous channel state information. The overall conclusion is that GO-CDM can play an important role in improving the performance of adaptive MIMO-OFDM systems.	bit error rate;channel state information;high-throughput computing;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;rx microcontroller family;requirement;selectivity (electronic);system requirements;throughput;trionic	Felip Riera-Palou;Guillem Femenias	2012	EURASIP J.

However, to overcome the high pathloss in the mmWave frequencies, beamforming with large antenna arrays is required at both the base station and user equipments for sufficient link budget. This feature is a challenge for beamforming training during initial access due to low SNR and poor synchronization. A recently developed compressive sensing (CS) based training algorithm exploits channel sparsity but it is vulnerable to phase error from poor synchronization. We propose a novel CS-based algorithm that tracks and compensates frequency offset and phase noise. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves achievable rate by 10 times compared with existing CS-based method during initial beamforming training.	algorithm;beamforming;compressed sensing;frequency offset;mimo;phase noise;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sparse matrix	Han Yan;Danijela Cabric	2016	2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)	10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905916	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	44.11325574882865	85.73747957111362	135727

679b8241e084f579dd3e4265afaf723dcd449b5d	subspace decomposition channel estimation for multiple virtual mimo sc-fdma systems		In this paper, we investigate the use of a subspace decomposition MIMO channel estimation algorithm for the blind estimation of the multiple virtual MIMO (V-MIMO) channels in Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) systems in order to increase its spectral efficiency. Groups of multiplexed users are formed, where each user is equipped with a single antenna, to transmit on the same frequency and time resources. When deployed in a V-MIMO system that resembles the LTE standard parameters, the proposed blind algorithm can obtain accurate estimates of the V-MIMO channels for each active user over every block of transmitted data. In addition, it is necessary to have knowledge of the channels state information to perform the users grouping and frequency allocation (scheduling). According to the LTE standard, sounding reference signals are employed in conjugation with Interleaved-frequency division multiple-access (I-FDMA). By eliminating the need to transmit an entire block of pilot symbols for each active transmitter, this permits for additional bandwidth efficiency in V-MIMO SC-FDMA systems in which multiple users occupy the same set of subcarriers as indicated by the LTE standard. The advantages of employing our proposed blind subspace-based channel estimation algorithm are verified by simulations results over fading channels, which demonstrate its practicality for use in the resulting V-MIMO SC-FDMA scheme with reduced training.	adobe framemaker;algorithm;automatic sounding;carrier frequency;channel state information;compaq lte;download;equalization (communications);frequency allocation;frequency divider;mimo;multi-user;multiplexing;scheduling (computing);simulation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;telecommunications link;transmitter;uncompressed video	Ashraf Tahat;Claude D'Amours;Benoît Champagne	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT)	10.1109/CIT.2017.56	lte advanced;fading;mimo;real-time computing;3g mimo;computer science;mimo-ofdm;electronic engineering;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;spectral efficiency;multiplexing	Visualization	44.55925035942344	83.52640630440754	136347

Each user transmits with probability λ, where typically λn < m ≪ n, and the receiver must detect which users transmitted. We show that when the codebook has i.i.d. Gaussian entries, detecting which u sers transmitted is mathematically equivalent to a certain sparsity detection problem considered in compressed sensing. Using recent sparsity results, we derive upper and lower bounds on the capacities of these channels. We show that common sparsity d etection algorithms, such as lasso and orthogonal matching p ursuit (OMP), can be used as tractable multiuser detection schemes and have significantly better performance than single-user det ection. These methods do achieve some near–far resistance but—at hi g signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)—may achieve capacities far below optimal maximum likelihood detection. We then present a new algorithm, called sequential OMP, that illustrates that iterative detection combined with power ordering or power shaping can significantly improve the high SNR performance. Sequential OMP is analogous to successive interference cancellation ithe classic multiple access channel. Our results thereby provi de insight into the roles of power control and multiuser detect ion on random-access signalling.	algorithm;cobham's thesis;codebook;compressed sensing;interference (communication);iterative method;lasso;multi-user;noise shaping;online advertising;openmp;random access;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix	Alyson K.

2dd63e16865f898795153e724d3e075c5a3537a7	mac rate region of low resolution adc digital and hybrid beamforming massive mimo ul		For 5G it will be important to leverage the available millimeter wave spectrum. To achieve an approximately omnidirectional coverage with a similar effective antenna aperture, an antenna array is required at both the mobile and basestation. Due to the large bandwidth and inefficient amplifiers available in CMOS for mmWave, the analog front-end of the transceiver with a large number of antennas is especially power hungry. Two main solutions exist to reduce the power consumption: Hybrid BeamForming (HBF) and Digital BeamForming (DBF) with low resolution ADC. This work compares the uplink rate region for both systems assuming a basestation with a large number of antennas. We show, that in the low SNR regime, the performance of DBF even with about 1–2 bits of resolution outperforms the one of HBF in terms of the achievable sum rate. The higher the SNR, the higher also the required resolution of the ADC to achieve a similar performance compared to HBF. If there is a large spread in receive power of the signal from different users, systems with very low resolution (1–3 bit) suffer from a performance loss.	4-bit;amplifier;analog front-end;analog-to-digital converter;beamforming;cmos;image resolution;mimo;overhead (computing);radio frequency;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral density;telecommunications link;transceiver;transmitter	Kilian Roth;Josef A.

For each survivor path, the phase estimate is updated recursively using symbol- decisions implied in the path. Unlike in the existing per-survivor timing recovery approach, there exists a single global timing loop that operates on a single stream of phase sequence released from the phase-estimating maximum-likelihood detector that is associated with the merged survivor path or the best up-to-date survivor path. The timing error detector itself is derived as a recursive formulation of the least square solution that minimizes error between the observation sequence and the clean expected signal sequence. Jitter analysis, stability analysis and tracking time simulation validate the proposed approach.	carrier recovery;error detection and correction;interference (communication);recursion;simulation;trellis quantization;viterbi algorithm	Jaekyun Moon;Jaewook Lee	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.163	synchronization;von neumann stability analysis;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;intersymbol interference;statistics	Embedded	48.80965186686902	74.86281038624811	136774

Thus the choice of the number of sub-carriers involves a tradeoff between mitigation of multi-path delay spread and reducing phase noise effects. Simulation results also show that phase noise effects performance for BPSK, QPSK & 16 PSK constellation which lead to the conclusion that a phase noise mitigation mechanism is needed to obtain acceptable performance.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;elegant degradation;phase noise;pre-shared key;profiling (computer programming);simulation;x.690	Md.

We show that it outperforms the conventional LCCM-gradient algorithm [5], in t e v of output SINR and improvement percentage index, for MA1 cancellation under mismatch environment. Moreover, the Wavelet-based structure can be used to further improve the performance of the proposed algorithm with pure MC-CDMA system.	algorithm;gradient;modulus of continuity;poisson wavelet;qr decomposition;recursive least squares filter;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Shiunn-Jang Chern;Chung-Yao Chang;Hsiao-Chen Liu	2002		10.1109/ISCAS.2002.1009810	code division multiple access;transmitter;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;performance;telecommunications;computer science;filter bank;control theory;mathematics;radio receiver;signal-to-noise ratio;fading;robustness;wavelet transform	ML	49.60775408823619	78.83205776826385	137138

Specifically, in the first stage, a simple least squares (LS) estimation is proposed to estimated the corrupt channel realizations. In the second stage, based on the corrupt imperfect channel, a low complexity LS estimation algorithm is proposed to estimate the compensate the effective PHN and CFO. The complexity of the algorithm is comparable with that of the traditional zero-forcing/MMSE algorithm in MIMO system. The solution does not require explicit knowledge of the PHN model and hence, is very robust to model variations. Finally, we show by simulations that there is significant performance gain compared with various existing baseline schemes.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);carrier frequency offset;emoticon;least squares;mimo;mimo-ofdm;phase noise;simulation;the matrix	Huang Huang;William G.

However, little attention has been paid to the pilot design in the massive MIMO system. To obtain the near-optimal pilot placement, two efficient schemes based on the block coherence (BC) of the measurement matrix are introduced. The first scheme searches the pilot pattern with the minimum BC value through the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) method. The second scheme combines the BC with probability model and then utilizes the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) method to solve the pilot allocation problem. Simulation results show that both of the methods outperform the equispaced search method, exhausted search method and random search method in terms of mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimate. Moreover, it is demonstrated that SPSA converges much faster than the other methods thus are more efficient, while CEO could provide more accurate channel estimation performance.	channel state information;compressed sensing;cross entropy;detection theory;frequency divider;mimo;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multiplexing;online and offline;pilot ace;random search;simulation;simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation;sparse matrix	Yang Nan;Xin Sun;Xiang Lin	2015	2015 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2015.7454372	mathematical optimization;computer science;control theory;compressed sensing	Metrics	51.05216999439391	81.63448632845146	137214

The second-generation terrestrial digital video broadcasting standard (DVB-T2) defines the preamble using several orthogonal sequences to convey the signaling, which yields high complexity due to the large number of required sequence correlations at the receiver. To solve this problem, this letter proposes a low-complexity preamble design that embeds the signaling by relative subcarrier position of two power-boosted subcarriers. At the receiver, the signaling can be simply extracted by power detection; thus, the complicated sequence correlation is not required any more, which leads to a significant reduction in the computational complexity. Meanwhile, the proposed preamble can be also used for reliable timing/frequency synchronization and channel estimation as well. Simulation results verify the robustness of the proposed preamble over typical multipath fading channels.	channel state information;computational complexity theory;digital video broadcasting;embedded system;multipath propagation;simulation;subcarrier;terrestrial television	Bo Hao;Zhaocheng Wang	2014	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2337298	telecommunications;computer science;computer network	EDA	46.480780419319224	80.81998875629343	137455

Current mud-pulse commercial systems are limited to only a few bits per second (bps). In this paper, we are interested in acoustic data transmission through the steel body of the drill string. We propose trellis coded modulation (TCM) coupled with multicarrier modulation. To cope with the intersymbol interference (ISI) and any synchronization issues at the receiver, joint carrier-phase synchronization and decision feedback equalization is used. In addition, weights based on the knowledge of the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at different passbands are incorporated into the modified Viterbi decoder to improve the bit-error rate (BER). By using a realistic model of a 1-km-drill string channel, the BER performance of the acoustic system is demonstrated while achieving a signaling rate of 400 bps, about two orders of magnitude higher than current state-of-art mud-pulse telemetry systems. In addition, our results demonstrate that the decision feedback equalizer (DFE) is vastly less power-hungry than orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).	acoustic cryptanalysis;bandwidth (signal processing);bit error rate;carrier wave;channel capacity;data rate units;encoder;equalization (communications);forward error correction;frequency divider;information sciences institute;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;modulation;multiplexing;real-time clock;real-time transcription;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;stationary process;trellis quantization;viterbi decoder;waveform;x.690	Konstantinos Pelekanakis;Mandar Chitre;Lakshmi Sutha Kumar;Yong Liang Guan	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems	10.1109/ICCS.2014.7024875	synchronization;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio;passband	Embedded	45.533264464093016	78.45145730953111	137556

The proposed TSS-LS utilizes two different thresholds and search windows to achieve fast acquisition. Furthermore, unlike the TSS-BS in which the bit reversal algorithm is applied in both steps, the linear search is adopted for the second step in the proposed TSS-LS to correctly find the starting point in the range of effective delay spread of the multipath channels, and to obtain reliable bit error rate performance of the UWB systems.	multipath propagation;ultra-wideband	Jaewoon Kim;Suckchel Yang;Yoan Shin	2007	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e90-a.7.1491	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;ultra-wideband	Mobile	51.55866676882456	77.82547520245302	137620

To solve this problem, we propose a successive overrelaxation (SOR)-based precoding scheme to approximate the matrix inversion by exploiting the asymptotically orthogonal channel property in massive MIMO systems. The proposed SOR- based precoding can reduce the complexity by about one order of magnitude, and it can also approach the classical RZF precoding with negligible performance loss. We also prove that the proposed SOR-based precoding enjoys a faster convergence rate than the recently proposed Neumann-based precoding. In addition, to guarantee the performance of SOR-based precoding, we propose a simple way to choose the optimal relaxation parameter in practical massive MIMO systems. Simulation results verify the advantages of SOR-based precoding in convergence rate and computational complexity in typical massive MIMO configurations.	approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);computational complexity theory;converge;linear programming relaxation;mimo;rate of convergence;roland gs;simulation;successive over-relaxation;the matrix;zero-forcing precoding	Tian Xie;Qian Han;Huazhe Xu;Zihao Qi;Wenqian Shen	2015	2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145618	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;mathematics;precoding	HPC	41.999848473047564	88.36547374662057	137685

Depending on the concatenation scheme used, we divide these receivers into the partitioned approach (PA) and the iterative approach (IA) receivers. The performance of both the PA and IA receivers is evaluated in Rayleigh fading channels for the uplink scenario. Numerical results show that the MMSE front-end turbo space-time iterative approach receiver (IA) effectively combats the mixture of MAI and intersymbol interference (ISI). To further investigate the possible achievable data rates in the turbo interference cancellation receivers, we introduce the puncturing of the turbo code through the use of rate compatible punctured turbo codes (RCPTCs). Simulation results suggest that combining interference cancellation, turbo decoding, STBC, and RCPTC can significantly improve the achievable data rates for a synchronous DS-CDMA system for the uplink in Rayleigh flat fading channels.	catastrophic interference;concatenation;data rate units;information sciences institute;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;load (computing);mimo;numerical linear algebra;pa-risc;puncturing;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;receiver operating characteristic;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link;transmitter;turbo code	Derrick B.

This provides extra degrees of freedom compared to the traditional transmit beamforming approach. It has been shown in the recent literature that MIMO radar systems have many advantages. In this paper, we consider the joint optimization of waveforms and receiving filters in the MIMO radar for the case of extended target in clutter. A novel iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize the waveforms and receiving filters such that the detection performance can be maximized. The corresponding iterative algorithms are also developed for the case where only the statistics or the uncertainty set of the target impulse response is available. These algorithms guarantee that the SINR performance improves in each iteration step. Numerical results show that the proposed methods have better SINR performance than existing design methods.	active set method;algorithm;authorization;clutter;ieee xplore;iteration;iterative method;lagrange multiplier;loss function;mimo;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;modulus robot;numerical analysis;optimization problem;performance;radar;relevance;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;transmitter;waveform	Chun-Yang Chen;Palghat P.

In this paper, a new concept of coordinate interleaver for MIMO-OFDM system and an optimum receiver structure are suggested. Using the CI, the real and imaginary components of signals experience different fading channels and it provides additional diversity gains. Simulation results show that the system employing the proposed CI outperforms the conventional V-BLAST architecture.	blast;broadcast delay;forward error correction;frequency divider;imaginary time;mimo;mimo-ofdm;paging;simulation;spatial multiplexing;spectral efficiency	SeokJoon Hong;Jin-Yong Choi;Soon Up Hwang;Sungho Jeon;Jong-Soo Seo	2009	VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073614	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;knowledge-based systems;computer performance;fading	Robotics	42.76363218090826	79.69420542317758	138545

By utilizing the inherent data structure, the interference is first separated with the desired symbol and then further decomposed into the one caused by the residues of decision errors and the other one by the undetected symbols in the successive interference cancellation (SIC) process.With such an ingenious interference decomposition along with the soft processing scheme, the new receiver can render more thorough interference cancellation, which in turn entails enhanced system performance. Moreover, for practical implementations, a low-complexity version, which only deal with the principal components of inter-carrier interference (ICI), is also addressed. Conducted simulations show that the developed receiver and its low-complexity implementation can provide superior performance compared with pervious works and is resilient to the presence of carrier-frequency offsets (CFOs). The low complexity implementation, in particular, requires substantially lower computational overhead with only slight performance loss.	bell laboratories layered space-time;catastrophic interference;data structure;frequency divider;ici (programming language);interference (communication);overhead (computing);simplified instructional computer;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link	Yung-Ping Tu;Wen-Hsien Fang;Yie-Tarng Chen	2012	2012 IEEE 75th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240109	adjacent-channel interference;single antenna interference cancellation;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;co-channel interference	Mobile	47.46417360550319	79.01834180604061	138576

One link-end uses all available antennas, while the other chooses the L out of N antennas that maximize capacity. We derive an upper bound on the capacity that can be expressed as the sum of the logarithms of ordered chi-square-distributed variables. This bound is then evaluated analytically and compared to the results obtained by Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that the achieved capacity is close to the capacity of a full-complexity system provided that L is at least as large as the number of antennas at the other link-end. For example, for L = 3, N = 8 antennas at the receiver and three antennas at the transmitter, the capacity of the reduced-complexity scheme is 20 bits/s/Hz compared to 23 bits/s/Hz of a full-complexity scheme.

The concept of Seamless Rate Adaptation (SRA) was introduced to seamlessly adapt the data rate of a connection to the changing channel while in operation without any service interruption. Interleavers in communication paths impose a constraint on the amount of data rate that can be changed by an SRA procedure. In the case of large changes in the channel, multiple consecutive SRA procedures have to be executed. Moreover, to keep an equal signal-to-noise-ratio margin over all tones, it is very likely that the bit loadings of all tones have to be modified in each SRA procedure. Hence, the state of the art SRA is too slow and provides means of adaptation only to slowly changing channels and will not prevent reinitializations under certain conditions such as large rapid changes in noise. In our previous work [14], we have presented approaches that optimize the adaptation procedures and bring down the adaptation time from the order of tens of seconds to the order of seconds. In this paper, we further optimize the adaptation procedures and show that modifying the bit-loadings of the used tones in groups leads to a faster decrease in the average bit error rate (BER) and therefore to less occurred errors. We present a low complex iterative rate adaptation approach that can be used in practice by modems with limited computing power to seamlessly adapt to changing channels.	bit error rate;computation;digital subscriber line;interrupt;iterative method;modem;sequence read archive;signal-to-noise ratio;uncompressed video;x.690	Wagih Sarhan;Anja Klein	2014	2014 6th International Symposium on Communications, Control and Signal Processing (ISCCSP)	10.1109/ISCCSP.2014.6877870	electronic engineering;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	50.36727267532663	81.3606156052638	138652

The proposed switching efficient scheme (SES) and bandwidth efficient scheme (BES) use the scan and wait combining technique (SWC) where a transmission occurs only when a branch with an acceptable performance is found, otherwise data is buffered. In these schemes, the modulation constellation size and the used transmit branch are determined to minimize the average number of switched branches and to achieve the highest spectral efficiency given the fading channel conditions, the required error rate performance, and a peak interference constraint to the primary receiver (PR). For delay-sensitive applications, we also propose two variations of the SES and BES schemes using power control (SES-PC and BES-PC) where the secondary transmitter (ST) starts sending data using a nominal power level which is selected in order to minimize the average delay introduced by the SWC technique. We demonstrate through numerical examples that the BES scheme increases the capacity of the secondary link when compared to the SES scheme. This spectral efficiency improvement comes at the expense of an increased average number of switched branches and thus an increased average delay. We also show that the SES-PC and the BES-PC schemes minimize the average delay while satisfying the same spectral efficiency as the SES and BES schemes, respectively.	accessible surface area;adaptive filter;adobe swc file;baseline (configuration management);cognitive radio;interference (communication);modulation;nominal power (radio broadcasting);numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);scsi enclosure services;scheme;spectral efficiency;transmitter;x.690	Zied Bouida;Khalid A.

An analysis on the sortedQR decomposition behavior, including its impact on the performance of symbol detection in large ill conditioned MIMO channel matrices, has been presented. As the correlation on the channel matrix grows, the sorted QR decomposition may not ensure its requirements, causing misleading symbol estimation. In this context, it is shown that orthogonality condition may be broken, depending on the matrix condition, which comes from propagation errors on the norm updating of the modified Gram–Schimidt method. Numerical results have corroborated our claims, demonstrating the sensitivity of the Gram–Schimidt algorithm, as well as the deterioration of the large-scale MIMO detection performance under highly correlated channels scenarios.	algorithm;blast;computation;condition number;elegant degradation;flops;lr parser;mimo;numerical analysis;numerical method;qr decomposition;requirement;sensor;simplified instructional computer;software propagation;sorting;the matrix;voice inversion;x.690;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Ricardo Tadashi Kobayashi;Taufik Abrão	2016	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-015-0123-5	theoretical computer science;mathematics;qr decomposition	ML	47.990729057351516	79.97778694589697	139415

We study SS embedding in both the discrete cosine transform and the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) domains. The contributions of this article are multiple-fold: first, we show that the conventional SS scheme could not be applied directly into the magnitudes of the DFT, and thus we present a modified SS scheme and the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) decoder based on the Weibull distribution is derived. Secondly, we investigate the improved spread spectrum (ISS) embedding, an improved technique of the traditional additive SS, and propose the modified ISS scheme for information hiding in the magnitudes of the DFT coefficients and the optimal ML decoders for ISS embedding are derived. We also provide thorough theoretical error probability analysis for the aforementioned decoders. Thirdly, sub-optimal decoders, including local optimum decoder (LOD), generalized maximum likelihood (GML) decoder, and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) decoder, are investigated to reduce the required prior information at the receiver side, and their theoretical decoding performances are derived. Based on decoding performances and the required prior information for decoding, we discuss the preferred host domain and the preferred decoder for additive SS-based data hiding under different situations. Extensive simulations are conducted to illustrate the decoding performances of the presented decoders.	coefficient;discrete fourier transform;discrete cosine transform;embedded system;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;local optimum;mean squared error;performance;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Amir Valizadeh;Z.

In order to suppress these interferences, we propose a precoding scheme in a heterogeneous network with cooperative femtocells, called CotIN elimination and CrotIN suppression with precoding criterion selection (ESPS) scheme. In this scheme, we first eliminate the CotINs of each user by applying the QR decomposition to channel matrix. Then the CrotINs of macrocell users and femtocell users are suppressed via the macrocell base station (MBS) and femtocell access points (FAPs) with precoding criterion selection, respectively. By using the ESPS scheme, spatial resources can be efficiently exploited. In addition, our ESPS scheme requires little information exchange between MBS and FAPs without iteration and thus significantly reduces the implementation complexity. Furthermore, the robustness is increased through introducing the information of channel uncertainty into the ESPS when channel estimation or quantization error exists. The performance analysis for the ESPS demonstrates that the ESPS is practical in the heterogeneous networks. Finally, simulation results show that the ESPS can decrease users’ bit error rates and increase their transmission rates.

The resulting algorithm is based on the space alternating generalized expectation maximization-maximum a posteriori probability (SAGE-MAP) technique which is particularly well suited to multicarrier signal formats. The algorithm is implemented in the time-domain which enables one to use the Gaussian approximation of the transmitted OFDM samples. Consequently, the averaging process of the nonpilot data symbols becomes analytically possible resulting in a feasible and computationally efficient channel estimation algorithm leading to a receiver structure that yields also an equalized output from which the data symbols are detected with excellent symbol error rate (SER) performance. Based on this Gaussian approximation the exact Bayesian Cramér Rao lower bound (CRLB) as well as the convergence rate of the algorithm are derived analytically. To reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm, discrete Legendre orthogonal basis functions are employed to represent the rapidly time-varying fading channel. It is shown that, depending on the normalized Doppler frequency, only a small number of expansion coefficients is sufficient to approximate the channel very well and there is no need to know the correlation function of the input signal. The computational complexity of the algorithm is shown to be ~O(NL) per detected data symbol and per SAGE-MAP algorithm cycle where is the number of OFDM subcarriers and is the number of multipath components.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;basis function;channel state information;coefficient;computational complexity theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency divider;multipath propagation;multiplexing;need to know;rate of convergence;subcarrier	Habib Senol;Erdal Panayirci;H.

859d2dd9c75157505f9b695b01f1e6ed61ea42fa	robust low complexity digital self interference cancellation for multi channel full duplex systems		Self interference in a communications system occurs when there is electromagnetic coupling between the transmission (TX) and reception (RX) radio frequency (RF) chains or antennas. This coupling degrades the system’s RX sensitivity to incoming signals. In this paper a low complexity technique for self interference cancellation in multi channel systems is presented. In this scenario, multiple carriers at overlapping arbitrary bandwidths and powers are simultaneously received and transmitted by the system. Traditional algorithms for self-interference mitigation based on Recursive Least Squares (RLS) and Least Mean Squares (LMS), fail to provide sufficient rejection since the incoming signal is not spectrally white, which is critical for their performance. The proposed algorithm mitigates the interference by modeling the incoming multi carrier signal as an Auto-Regressive (AR) process and jointly estimates the AR parameters and self interference. The resulting algorithm can be implemented using a low complexity architecture comprised of only two RLS modules. The main advantage of the proposed technique over RLS and LMS is the robustness to the spectrum of arbitrary incoming signals and improved rejection levels of over 10dB. All of this is achieved while not compromising on low latency constraints.	algorithm;autoregressive model;bandwidth (signal processing);carrier wave;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);least mean squares filter;radio frequency;recursion (computer science);recursive least squares filter;rejection sampling	Shachar Shayovitz;Dan Raphaeli	2018	2018 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)	10.1109/SSP.2018.8450827	single antenna interference cancellation;communications system;robustness (computer science);duplex (telecommunications);radio frequency;recursive least squares filter;electronic engineering;least mean squares filter;interference (wave propagation);computer science	Mobile	51.514213292132915	79.95262377851043	139596

When binary code sequence such as M sequence is used, there is a possibility of generating extra Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) in the UWB system. Therefore, it is quite a challenging task to collect the energy efficiently although RAKE reception method is applied at the receiver. The main purpose of the proposed system is to overcome the performance degradation for UWB transmission due to the occurrence of Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) during high speed transmission of ultra short pulses in a multipath channel. The proposed system improves the system performance by improving the RAKE reception performance using RR sequence and suppressing the ISI effect with the equalizer. Simulation results verify that significant improvement can be obtained by the proposed system especially in UWB multipath channel models such as channel CM4 that suffered severe ISI effect.	ultra-wideband	Keat Beng Toh;Shin'ichi Tachikawa	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e91-a.9.2637	equalizer;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;ultra-wideband;computer performance;efficient energy use;matched filter;rake receiver	OS	45.801280810853726	80.67286101233722	139655

The system, which uses spatial resources bi-directionally and employs beamforming, is called a `bi-directional beamforming (BBF)' system. The use of full bandwidth and the reciprocity between time and frequency allow the BBF system to reduce the symbol duration. Focusing on this reduction in symbol duration, we propose a transmit antenna-switched receive diversity for BBF (TAS-BBF) scheme designed to improve reliability in time selective environments. The resulting TAS-BBF scheme with N antennas can achieve diversity order of 2(N-1) in fast fading environments without channel state information at the transmitter, whereas conventional schemes are only able to achieve a diversity order of N in this environment.	beamforming;best bin first;bi-directional text;channel state information;selectivity (electronic);thermal-assisted switching;transmitter	Dongkyu Kim;Hyungsik Ju;Seokjung Kim;Haesoon Lee;Daesik Hong	2013	2013 Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers	10.1109/ACSSC.2013.6810220	electronic engineering;antenna diversity;geography;telecommunications;communication;precoding	Mobile	42.59531276286918	79.59184649199445	139857

Considering the special case of the 2 × 1 Alamouti orthogonal space-time block code, this work proposes to reduce computational complexity associated with the CSI acquisition by including a decision rule to automatically determine the time instants when CSI must be again updated. Otherwise, a previous channel estimate is reused. The decision criterion has a very low computational complexity since it consists in computing the cross-correlation between preambles sent by the two transmit antennas. This allows us to obtain a considerable reduction on the complexity demanded by both supervised and unsupervised (blind) channel estimation algorithms. Such preambles do not penalize the spectral efficiency in the sense they are mandatory for frame detection as well as for time and frequency synchronization in current wireless communication systems.	algorithm;block code;channel state information;computational complexity theory;cross-correlation;simulation;spectral efficiency;supervised learning	Paula Maria Castro;Adriana Dapena;José Antonio García-Naya;Josmary Labrador	2012	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-012-1112-1	telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science	Mobile	50.15333429048291	77.43201828490079	139906

Accurate estimation of the channel parameters is critical as it has great impact on the overall BER performance. We present an iterative space-time multiuser (STMU) turbo detection and estimation scheme, based on space alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) algorithm. This algorithm operates on the coded symbols by exchanging soft information between the detector and the estimator. We show through computer simulations that the proposed low complexity STMU receiver considerably outperforms conventional estimation schemes and achieves excellent performance, both in terms of BER and estimation error variance. Finally, we will consider different mapping strategies and investigate their impact on the performance and complexity of the estimator.	complexity;computer simulation;estimation theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;iteration;iterative method;modulation;multi-user;multipath propagation;telecommunications link;x.690	Mamoun Guenach;Henk Wymeersch;Marc Moeneclaey	2005	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2005.853458	computer simulation;synchronization;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	47.745091049292455	74.55189011988027	139948

For an independent block fading channel, the Grassmannian beamformer has been shown to provide very good performance using limited amount of feedback. However, the original Grassmannian beamformer does not take the time domain correlation of the channel fading into consideration. In this work, based on a first order auto-regressive (AR1) dynamic fading model, we develop two new classes of beamforming algorithms that exploit the interframe correlations in the channel fading. The first algorithm is based on a predictive vector quantization (PVQ) approach, and the resulting PVQ beamformer accomplishes very good SNR performance. In addition, to simplify the implementation complexity, we also develop a successive beamforming (SBF) algorithm. The new SBF scheme uses the knowledge of the previous fading blocks to aid the beamforming codebook design of the current fading block. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed PVQ beamformer and successive beamformer outperform several other previously proposed beamformers at various fading scenarios.	algorithm;beamforming;codebook;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;vector quantization	Li Liu;Hamid Jafarkhani	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.254929	computer simulation;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;channel state information;fading;precoding;statistics	Robotics	47.41073324174217	77.95308077349385	139952

The design uses several techniques to significantly save computations and energy without affecting the performance. Prototype results clearly indicate significant reduction of calculations as Eb/N0 increases with no performance degradation. The proposed design will be highly useful in low power DVB-T2 receivers.

Accurate estimation of such parameter is critical in many applications that involve prior knowledge of the number of received signals. Information theoretic approaches such as Akaikes information criterion (AIC) and minimum description length (MDL) have been used extensively even though they are complex and show bad performance at some stages. In this paper, a new algorithm for estimating the number of sources is presented. This algorithm exploits the estimated eigenvalues of the auto correlation coefficient matrix rather than the auto covariance matrix, which is conventionally used, to estimate the number of sources. We propose to use either of a two simply estimated decision statistics, which are the moving increment and moving standard deviation as metric to estimate the number of sources. Then process a simple calculation of the increment or standard deviation of eigenvalues to find the number of sources at the location of the maximum value. Results showed that our proposed algorithms have a better performance in comparison to the popular and more computationally expensive AIC and MDL at low SNR values and low number of collected samples.	analysis of algorithms;autocorrelation;coefficient;expectation–maximization algorithm;information theory;mdl (programming language);minimum description length;std bus;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio	Tara Salman;Ahmed Badawy;Tarek M.

4447efeac8a16fbf3b1a34155ac3ca0fc127cd77	efficient channel state information acquisition in massive mimo systems using non-orthogonal pilots		The objective of this article is to review and benchmark strategies to acquire channel state information (CSI) in time-division duplex (TDD) Massive MIMO systems. In particular, we consider the use of statistical CSI at the base stations (BSs), together with non-orthogonal pilot sequences. Such techniques can theoretically reduce the amount of spectral resources dedicated to channel sounding, thanks to the increased pilot reuse that they allow. We review their application, and present a holistic evaluation of their practical implementation and limitations, including factors that are often neglected in theoretical works, including covariance estimation and tracking, non-orthogonal pilot sequences, signaling associated with dynamically allocated pilot sequences, realistic channel model (spatial covariance, stationarity), and imperfect statistical CSI. We present a possible design addressing these various problems with reasonable complexity, and benchmark the achieved performance. Our results show that when the cost of CSI acquisition is properly accounted for, the tracking of statistical CSI together with the use of non-orthogonal pilots enables to reach a higher effective spectral efficiency than what can be achieved with orthogonal pilot sequences.	automatic sounding;benchmark (computing);channel (communications);channel state information;cooperative mimo;duplex (telecommunications);holism;multi-user mimo;overhead (computing);spatial analysis;spectral efficiency;stationary process;test-driven development	Paul Ferrand;Alexis Decurninge;Maxime Guillaud;Luis Garcia Ordóñez	2017			mimo;real-time computing;channel state information;estimation of covariance matrices;channel sounding;reuse;covariance function;spectral efficiency;electronic engineering;communication channel;engineering	Mobile	43.836189176729164	84.66205649736582	140191

In this paper, a performance evaluation of OFDM/TDM using MMSE-FDE with pilot-assisted channel estimation over a fast fading channel is presented. To improve the tracking ability against fast fading a robust pilot-assisted channel estimation is presented that uses time-domain filtering on a slot-by-slot basis and frequency-domain interpolation. We derive the mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimator and then discuss a tradeoff between improving the tracking ability against fading and the noise reduction. The achievable bit error rate (BER) performance is evaluated by computer simulation and compared with conventional OFDM. It is shown that the OFDM/TDM using MMSE-FDE achieves a lower BER and a better tracking ability against fast fading in comparison with conventional OFDM.	adobe framemaker;bit error rate;channel state information;computer simulation;first-order predicate;interpolation;mean squared error;multiplexing;noise reduction;performance evaluation;toad data modeler;x.690	Haris Gacanin;Fumiyuki Adachi	2009	EURASIP J.

In this paper, we generalize this analysis by considering the generalized waveforms for multi-carrier (GWMC) modulation system based on any family of modulation functions, and we derive a general approximate expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of its PAPR, for both finite and infinite integration time. These equations allow us to directly find the expressions of the PAPR distribution for any particular functions and characterize the behaviour of the PAPR distribution associated with different transmission and observation scenarios. In addition to that, a new approach to formulating the PAPR reduction problem as an optimization problem, is presented in this study.	approximation algorithm;frequency divider;mathematical optimization;modulation;multiplexing;optimization problem;power architecture platform reference;waveform	Marwa Chafii;Jacques Palicot;Rémi Gribonval	2014	EURASIP J.

More specifically, we consider the case of a general time-division multiple access (TDMA) frame-based receiver equipped with multiple sensors and restrict our attention to second order based subspace methods that are suitable for most standard communication applications due to their moderate computational cost. The semi-blind channel estimator is obtained as a regularized least-squares solution where a blind subspace criterion plays the role of the regularization constraint. The main contribution of the paper consists of showing by asymptotic analysis how to optimally tune the balance between the blind criterion and the least-squares fit, depending on the design parameters of the system. Simulations show that the proposed solutions are robust and significantly improve the efficiency of the equalization."""	channel state information;semiconductor industry	Vincent Buchoux;Olivier Cappé;Eric Moulines;Alexei Gorokhov	2000	IEEE Trans.

a7359abcffd4f50334a29921275bade7881f09fb	two novel multiband centimetre-wave patch antennas for a novel ofdm based rfid system		—Two novel multiband patch antennas operating at centimetre band are proposed for a novel orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based radio-frequency identification (RFID) reader. Here, the first one is a dual band antenna with centre frequencies of 7.30 GHz and 9.50 GHz, while the second one is a triple band antenna centred at 7.75 GHz, 9.70 GHz and 11.90 GHz. Both the patch antennas are designed with equal-width horizontal arms as radiating elements and a microstrip feeding line as the feeder. The antennas are moderately small sized with dimensions of 40.30 mm by 35.10 mm. Simulations with Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio tool indicate that competitive values of different antenna parameters are achieved when compared with centimetre band antennas described in the literature. With the use of MATLAB tool, the bit error rate (BER) performance of the multiband antennas are simulated for outdoor Rayleigh and Rician fading channels. Simulation results for the proposed two antennas indicate that for a given number of OFDM subcarriers, the larger the bandwidth of the signals received by the RFID reader, larger the BER degradation. These results have confirmed the usability of the designed antenna in commercial OFDM based RFID readers.	acoustic lobing;bandwidth (signal processing);bit error rate;coat of arms;computer simulation;elegant degradation;frequency divider;matlab;microstrip;microwave;multiplexing;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;rayleigh–ritz method;subcarrier;usability;x.690	Nayan Sarker;Md.

Multi-dimensional set partitioning proposed by Zhang et.al. [1] is applied to form a reduced-state trellis or the subset trellis. The Max-Log-MAP algorithm is modified to operate on the subset trellis in order to generate soft information at reduced complexity. The backward recursion can often be avoided since the forward recursion of the Max-LogMAP algorithm is capable of providing reliable soft information when some fixed decision delay is introduced. This idea is leveraged in the equalization scheme proposed in this paper. It generates soft information using only the forward recursion of the Max-Log-MAP algorithm and is referred to as the Forward-Only algorithm. A key requirement of reduced-state equalization is the ability to decide winners of parallel transitions using low-complexity slicing operations, which is accomplished via a novel flexible-complexity algorithm, viz., Reduced-State Tree Detection. Due to set partitioning, soft decision failure can occur in the forward-only algorithm and in such an event, a general approach to regenerate soft information using delayed decision feedback is proposed. The low complexity and memory requirements of the forward-only algorithm makes it attractive for MIMO-ISI equalization.	algorithm;clipping (computer graphics);information sciences institute;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;recursion (computer science);requirement;trellis quantization;viz: the computer game	Bharadwaj Satchidanandan;Kiran Kuchi;R.

24cb281e73554486df5434cd882b049780381357	forward modeling assisted digital predistortion method for hybrid beamforming transmitters with a single pa feedback		This paper presents a novel forward modeling digital predistortion (DPD) method for hybrid beamforming transmitters based on a single power amplifier (PA) feedback. In hybrid beamforming transmitters, when multiple data streams are transmitted simultaneously, implementing DPD requires that all the PA’s outputs are sampled and divided into multiple data streams, which costs large hardware resources when there are massive antennas. However, generally, the PAs’ behavioral characteristics in beamforming transmitters are very similar, so the proposed method needs only one PA’s output in the feedback path to forward model all the PAs. Then all the PAs’ outputs can be estimated and used to extract DPD coefficients in digital domain. Compared with the DPD method that needs all the PA’s feedbacks of a hybrid beamforming transmitter, the proposed method can realize equivalent linearization performance while reducing PAs’ feedbacks significantly. The robustness of the proposed method is also validated by simulation. Compared with the existing single PA feedback DPD method, the proposed method can be also implemented even when multiple signals are in the same frequency band and it can thus enhance spectrum efficiency.

The decorrelating receiver applies the inverse correlation matrix of signature waveforms to detect the received signal. A procedure for finding such an inverse matrix is developed. This procedure employs the reciprocal basis, derived from the basis of normalized user signatures, to cancel simultaneously both the multiuser and the intersymbol interference. The proposed multiuser detector operates over a finite detection window, and the only restriction imposed on the set of signatures is that the signatures must be independent at the receiver end. If the channel is slowly variant, the detector can be very efficient for high bit rate transmissions. Theoretical bounds for the multiuser interference are obtained. Simulation results, in which both binary and non-binary sequences are used, reveal that the behaviour of the detector approaches the single user bound when an adequate set of signatures is employed. The reduced complexity of this detector indicates that it could be a good candidate for practical implementation.		Ángel M. Bravo-Santos;J. Monera-Llorca;Vijay K.

The concept of SC/FDE allows an advantageous combination of feed forward frequency domain equalization and feed back equalization in the time domain, that combines low signal processing complexity and powerful equalization. Although the concept of decision feedback equalization (DFE) is a well known and developed theory, this nonlinear equalization is rarely investigated in an overall system approach. Based on that the possible performance gain will be characterized under the constraints of channel characteristics, error propagation, higher order modulation schemes and channel coding. It will be demonstrated that these elements have significant influence on the possible performance of DFE and may reduce the propagated high performance gain.	adobe framemaker;channel capacity;forward error correction;modulation;nonlinear system;propagation of uncertainty;signal processing;software propagation	Harald Witschnig;Klemens Reich;Harald Stallinger;Robert Weigel;Andreas Springer	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Communications (IEEE Cat.

The modulation techniques examined are phase shift keying with and without differential encoding and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation. Two types of receiver structures are proposed, namely, the symbol-by-symbol receiver with pilot-symbol assisted-modulation and the simultaneous data detection and carrier frequency/phase offset estimation receiver. Both receivers incorporate the use of the maximum likelihood frequency/phase estimator of a single sinusoid in noise that we recently derived in the work of Fu and Kam (2007 and 2006) to estimate and compensate for the effects of the unknown carrier frequency and phase offset. The error performance of the proposed receivers are examined via computer simulations.	additive white gaussian noise;carrier frequency;computer simulation;delta-sigma modulation;key (cryptography);utility functions on indivisible goods	Hua Fu;Pooi Yuen Kam;Chee Cheon Chui	2008	VTC Spring 2008 - IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2008.279	computer simulation;continuous phase modulation;in-phase and quadrature components;electronic engineering;quadrature amplitude modulation;low if receiver;telecommunications;computer science;carrier recovery;frequency offset;control theory;radio receiver design;maximum likelihood;direct-conversion receiver;statistics	EDA	49.23780076743189	75.1618375665189	141713

The proposed scheme effectively mitigates the intercarrier interference (ICI) due to frequency offset (FO) between two distributed antennas. The transmitter side of the proposed scheme transmits each of the two subslots in Alamouti code through two remote subcarriers symmetric to the center frequency and is referred to as space-frequency reversal schemes by Wang et al. or Choi. The receiver side of the proposed scheme is significantly different from the conventional scheme or the scheme proposed by Wang et al. in that it performs two discrete Fourier transform (DFT), each of which is synchronized to each transmit antenna's carrier frequency. The decision variables are generated by performing a simple linear combining with the same complexity as that of the conventional Alamouti code. The derivation shows that in flat-fading channels, the dominant ICI components due to FO cancel each other during the combining process. The proposed scheme achieves almost the same performance as the ideal Alamouti scheme, even with large FO. To use this ICI self-cancellation property for selective fading channels or in cases with timing offset (TO) between two transmit antennas, the total subcarriers are divided into several subblocks, and the proposed scheme is applied to each subblock. For mildly selective channels or cases with practically small TO, the proposed scheme achieves significantly improved performance compared with the conventional space-frequency Alamouti-coded OFDM.	carrier frequency;catastrophic interference;decision theory;discrete fourier transform;frequency offset;ici (programming language);interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;simulation;subcarrier;time complexity;transmitter;uncompressed video;x.690	Bong-seok Kim;Kwonhue Choi	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2325606	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;fading	Mobile	47.17424935888218	79.23303057571934	141884

Coarse timing estimation is performed for the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system. The probability of worst case is introduced in terms of the probability of correct detection of each distributed receive antenna. A minimax criterion is proposed to provide the optimal antenna locations in a sense that it offers the best system performance that the probability of worst case is minimized. Simulation results illustrate that the distributed receive antennas should be located symmetrically about the linear cell when the mobile station distribution is uniform. The optimal antenna locations also show robustness to carrier frequency offset.

The proposed system shapes the channel matrix of a frequency-selective fading channel into a piecewise flat fading over each block of two adjacent subcarriers. Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms the conventional SFBC in frequency-selective fading channels, which assumes that the channel parameters are equal over the duration of the codeword. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed system offers a superior performance in fast time-varying channels where the interference that results from the channel variations acts only as an additive noise. In addition to its superior performance, the proposed system has low computational complexity, because it is based on the short-block-length Walsh-Hadamard transform.	additive white gaussian noise;code word;computation;computational complexity theory;hadamard transform;interference (communication);mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;simulation;subcarrier;utility functions on indivisible goods	Arafat J.

However, the correlation between individual sub-channels in a real-world wireless channel may result in a substantial degradation on the performance of the MIMO system. We investigate the MIMO link level performance with zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detections under the scenario that the individual sub-channels are correlated. We show that, for the exponential correlation channel model, an increase in channel correlation between the transmission paths results in a decrease in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver.	channel (communications);elegant degradation;mimo;multipath propagation;programming paradigm;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;stellar classification;time complexity;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Rongtao Xu;Francis Chung-Ming Lau	2005	2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1465748	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;control theory;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless;statistics;mimo	Mobile	44.6724586239472	77.8139769441396	142065

Most existing literature on spectrum sensing has focused on impairments introduced by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). However, this assumption fails to model the behavior of certain noise types in practice, such as impulsive noise. In this paper, the use of a non-parametric, easily implementable detection device, polarity-coincidence-array (PCA) detector, is proposed for weak primary signal detection with a cognitive radio equipped with multiple antennas. The detector performance in terms of the probabilities of detection and false alarm is derived when the communication channels between the primary user transmitter and the multiple antennas at the cognitive radio undergo Rayleigh fading. From the numerical results, it is observed that a significant performance enhancement is achieved by the PCA detector compared to that of the simple energy detector as the heaviness of the tail of the non-Gaussian noise increases.	additive white gaussian noise;cognitive radio;detection theory;mimo;numerical analysis;rayleigh fading;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Thakshila Wimalajeewa;Pramod K.

6447327204bf2fe9f1ad16b3186f621d1316414f	sequential channel equalization in strong line-of-sight mimo communication		In this paper, we show a novel algorithm for strong line-of-sight (LoS) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channel equalization. With optimally spaced antennas under specific arrangements, the LoS channels can be made spatially orthogonal. In practice, antenna displacements are expected. Conventional algorithms like zero-forcing (ZF) do not consider the special properties of the LoS MIMO channel and result in high complexity. We show that the LoS MIMO channel can be factorized into a product of three matrices. Thereby, the two diagonal matrices at the outer product positions are the most varying terms and should be compensated dynamically. Being a good tradeoff between complexity and robustness, the proposed sequential channel equalization is applied in a reverse order of the factorization. The algorithm can be applied to LoS MIMO systems with uniform linear or rectangular arrays, which are making use of digital or analog equalization. By considering the usage of the Winograd butterfly and Butler matrices, the number of multiplications in both digital and analog implementations of the proposed solution is increasing approximately linearly with respect to the number of antennas, while the complexity of the state-of-the-art designs grows quadratically. As found numerically and verified experimentally, the proposed method performs nearly as well as the ZF-based algorithms with near-optimal arrangements, while having significantly lower complexity.

First, we introduce a general framework for expressing the spatial multiplexing relation of the transmit signals only from the antenna scattering parameters and the modulating reactive loading. This not only avoids tedious far-field calculations, but more importantly provides an efficient and practical strategy for spatially multiplexing PSK signals of any modulation order. The proposed approach allows ensuring a constant impedance matching at the input of the driving antenna for all symbol combinations, and as importantly uses only passive reconfigurable loads. This obviates the use of reconfigurable matching networks and active loads, respectively, thereby overcoming stringent limitations of previous single-feed MIMO techniques in terms of complexity, efficiency, and power consumption. The proposed approach is illustrated by the design of a realistic very compact antenna system optimized for multiplexing QPSK signals. The results show that the proposed approach can bring the MIMO benefits to the low-end user terminals at a reduced RF complexity.	basis (linear algebra);characteristic impedance;embedded system;emoticon;hp 48 series;imaginary time;impedance matching;input impedance;lossless compression;mimo;modulation;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;out-of-band agreement;pre-shared key;radio frequency;real life;reconfigurable computing;rewrite (programming);scattering parameters;secure hash standard;spatial multiplexing;the matrix;transmitter	Mohsen Yousefbeiki;Osama N.

In this letter, we propose a minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithm for the OFDM equalization which allows to utilize the energy invested into the postfix. As a result, the bit-error rate (BER) of an OFDM system can be improved.	algorithm;bit error rate;catastrophic interference;equalization (communications);frequency divider;frequency offset;ici (programming language);interference (communication);mean squared error;multiplexing;subcarrier;x.690	Alexander Arkhipov	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5450323	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics	Embedded	47.88704408183088	81.07701516507656	142572

SLM requires the transmission of several side information bits for each data block, which results in some data rate loss. These bits must generally be channel-encoded because they are particularly critical to the error performance of the system. This increases the system complexity and transmission delay, and decreases the data rate even further. In this paper, we propose a novel SLM method for which no side information needs to be sent. By considering the example of several OFDM systems using either QPSK or 16-QAM modulation, we show that the proposed method performs very well both in terms of PAPR reduction and bit error rate at the receiver output provided that the number of subcarriers is large enough.	bit error rate;data rate units;itil;information needs;modulation;multiplexing;power architecture platform reference;spatial light modulator;subcarrier;uncompressed video;x.690	Stéphane Y.

The received array element outputs are transformed to delay–Doppler domain by using the cross-ambiguity function (CAF) for efficient exploitation of the delay–Doppler diversity of the multipath components. Clusters of multipath components can be identified by using a simple amplitude thresholding in the delay–Doppler domain. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) can be used to identify parameters of the multipath components in each cluster. The performance of the proposed PSO-CAF technique is compared with the space alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) technique and with a recently proposed PSO based technique at various SNR levels. Simulation results clearly quantify the superior performance of the PSO-CAF technique over the alternative techniques at all practically significant SNR levels. & 2011 Elsevier B.V.

c0f67c2e5896efac104fbbe0e0fed5f610ba4b6d	sum-mse performance gain of dft-based channel estimator over frequency-domain ls one in full-duplex ofdm systems with colored interference		In this paper, we make an investigation on the summean-square-error (sum-MSE) performance gain achieved by DFT-based least-square (LS) channel estimator over frequencydomain LS one in full-duplex OFDM system in the presence of colored interference and noise. The closed-form expression of the sum-MSE performance gain is given. Its simple upper and lower bounds are derived by using inequalities of matrix eigen-values. By simulation and analysis, the upper lower bound is shown to be close to the exact value of MSE gain as the ratio of the number N of total subcarriers to the cyclic prefix length L grows and the correlation factor of colored interference increases. More importantly, we also find that the MSE gain varies from one to N/L as the correlation among colored interferences decreases gradually. According to theoretical analysis, we also find the MSE gain has very simple forms in two extreme scenarios. In the first extreme case that the colored interferences over all subchannels are fully correlated, i.e., their covariance matrix is a matrix of allones, the sum-MSE gain reduces to 1. In other words, there is no performance gain. In the second extreme case that the coloredinterference covariance matrix is an identity matrix, i.e, they are mutually independent, the achievable sum-MSE performance gain is N/L. A large ratio N/L will achieve a significant sumMSE gain.	duplex (telecommunications);eigen (c++ library);interference (communication);least squares;simulation;subcarrier	Zhongjing Wang;Feng Shu;Jinhui Lu;Hai Yu;Riqing Chen;Jun Li;Dushantha Nalin K.

In this paper, a novel multi-rate sub-Nyquist spectrum detection(MSSD) system is introduced for cooperative wideband spectrum sensing in a distributed CR network. Using only a few sub- Nyquist samples, MSSD is able to sense the wideband spectrum without full spectrum recovery. Specifically, given the low spectral occupancy, sub-Nyquist sampling is performed in each sampling channel and a test statistic is formed by using sub-Nyquist samples from multiple sampling channels. Furthermore, the use of different sub-Nyquist sampling rates is proposed to improve the system detection performance, and the performance of MSSD over both non-fading and Rayleigh fading channels is analyzed. Numerical results show that MSSD can considerably improve the wideband spectrum sensing performance in a fading scenario, with a relatively low implementation complexity and a low computational complexity.	cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;nyquist rate;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;overhead (computing);rayleigh fading;requirement;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectrum analyzer	Hongjian Sun;Arumugam Nallanathan;Jing Jiang;David I.

However, despite its simplicity, this approach has certain drawbacks. In this paper, we propose an alternative approximate method which considers hexagonal-shaped cells. We develop a geometrical-based stochastic model and derive analytical expressions for the statistics of the angle-of-arrival of the uplink interfering signals in a cellular system. Simulations performed exhibit the characteristics of our proposal and evaluate both hexagonal and circular approximations. The impact of various parameters on the performance of a cellular system is also investigated. The derived expressions simplify the analysis of wireless networks and improve the accuracy of the simulations when hexagonal cells are employed.

2aff961c8f9327bdac3e3ac2fc017873b9549943	performance of soft-decision linear receivers for spatial-multiplexing fbmc/oqam		With the increasing demand for mobile data traffic, enhanced frequency localized transmissions are considered for the generation of wireless networks to come. Filter Bank Multi-Carrier modulation, with the use of Offset-QAM, proves to be an interesting candidate to satisfy those spectrum constraints. Contrary to CP-OFDM, FBMC does not use any CP. Its spectral efficiency is improved but it also weakens the transmissions over highly frequency selective channels. Complex detection stage based on precoding or multi-tap equalization is thus necessary to prevent orthogonality losses. Another solution can be the use of the Frequency-Spreading scheme which improves the frequency resolution. In this paper, we propose to extend probabilistic decoding to linear FBMC receivers. The performances of the two common FBMC receiver structures, PolyPhase Network and Frequency-Spreading, are assessed over frequency-selective LTE channel models.

We derive new expressions for the average error rate of DTD in the absence of receiver phase compensation (RPC), which is useful for a large number of modulation schemes. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of feedback delay and CGD on DTD compared to spatially correlated co-located transmit diversity (CTD) systems. Analytical results enable us to verify the fact that in DTD without RPC as CGD between antennas increases the performance degrades. Via extensive performance evaluations for various cases, we quantitatively analyze the sensitivity of the performance gap between CTD and DTD in absence of RPC according to feedback delay. The results show that, in without RPC case DTD is robust to feedback delay compared to correlated CTD.

In order to improve the performance and the efficiency of wireless communication systems these two techniques have been recently used jointly in new schemes named joint adaptive modulation and diversity combining (JAMDC) schemes. Considering the problem of finding low-complexity, bandwidth-efficient, and processing-power efficient transmission schemes for a downlink scenario and capitalizing on one of these recently proposed JAMDC schemes, we propose and analyze in this paper two fully joint adaptive modulation, diversity combining, and power control (FJAMDC) schemes. More specifically, the modulation constellation size, the number of combined diversity paths, and the needed power level are jointly determined to achieve the highest spectral efficiency with the lowest possible combining complexity, given the fading channel conditions and the required error rate performance. Selected numerical examples show that the newly proposed schemes considerably increase the spectral efficiency with a slight increase in the average number of combined path for the low signal to noise ratio (SNR) range while maintaining compliance with the bit error rate (BER) performance and a low radiated power which yields to a substantial decrease in interference to co-existing systems/users.	adaptive grammar;bit error rate;interference (communication);modulation;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;x.690	Zied Bouida;Khalid A.

At first, the uplink signal detection is performed independently in each cell according to minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion. Subsequently, the detection results are applied to reconstruct the transmit signals of different users and cancel their interference to neighboring cells. With the help of reconstruction results, the MMSE detection matrix of each cell is updated. The channel responses of both efficient and interference links are estimated with the help of pilots. The pilot allocation parameter is introduced to indicate the quality of channel estimation. The simulation results indicate that intercell interference can be greatly mitigated by the proposed algorithm with a moderate number of receiver antennas at the base station.	interference (communication);mimo	Zhengzhen Zhang;Chao Dong;Qian Wan	2018	Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing	10.1155/2018/3526906	computer network;mimo;single antenna interference cancellation;computer science;detection theory;telecommunications link;algorithm;minimum mean square error;interference (wave propagation);base station;communication channel	Mobile	42.993014278997066	84.38148867760286	143534

As the targeted data rate increases, shorter spreading codes are used, leading to a higher sensitivity to inter symbol interference (ISI). This paper presents a comparative study on the effect of different spreading codes on the system performance. The results show that the use of m-sequences increase the system performance in the case of BPSK modulation, at the cost of a decreased scalability in terms of available data rates. For 4BOK modulation, we present original coding schemes leading to an increased robustness to ISI in the case of uncoded communication. These results confirm that ISI can effectively be mitigated by using specifically optimized spreading codes.	data rate units;download;error floor;hadamard code;ibm tivoli storage productivity center;information sciences institute;interference (communication);modulation;qr code;scalability;ultra-wideband;uncompressed video	Pascal Pagani	2008	2008 14th European Wireless Conference		electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;communication	Mobile	43.41872928178205	79.90809289021065	143608

So modulation and multiple access schemes insuring minimum interference are required for CR transmission. Multiwavelets are rarely considered in the field of wireless communication. They are orthogonal and symmetric waveforms with short support and can insure lower multiple access interference in a multiuser environment. Hence a multi-user CR network using Bspline multiwavelets of different orders is considered in this paper for evaluating the performance characteristics. The cross correlation and multi-user interference are derived and its effect on error performance of linear, quadratic and cubic wavelets are analyzed. Simulation results p rove that the number of users within a network can be increased by using spline wavelets of different orders without compromising on error performance.	b-spline;cognitive radio;cubic function;interference (communication);multi-user;simulation;software deployment;spline (mathematics);spline wavelet	Mathew Manju;A.

However, the conventional receiver suffers from multiuser interference and the near-far effect. To alleviate this problem, various multiuser receivers have been proposed. They have been shown to enhance the performance of the conventional receiver with respect to capacity and interference rejection. But these receivers, intended for Gaussian noise channels, can fail in other environments such as impulsive noise conditions. A possible solution is to exploit the advantages of neural networks. A neural network’ s ability to reject non-Gaussian noise can be utilized to implement multiuser receivers that reject both impulsive noise and multiuser interference. Following this logic, this paper considers nonadaptive multiuser receiver and adaptive multiuser receiver based on radial basis function neural networks. Simulations of these receivers show results that are superior to previously studied multiuser receivers, with respect to practicality and performance.	adaptive grammar;algorithm;artificial neural network;computer simulation;horseland;interference (communication);mobile phone;multi-user;radial (radio);radial basis function network;rejection sampling	Insoo Sohn;Someshwar C.

In spectrum sensing, the energy detection has a disadvantage that it is difficult to detect the signal of the primary user in the low SNR. In this paper, we use a convolution neural network to enhance the performance in low SNR. For the practical test, the proposed scheme is implemented with Universal Software Radio Peripheral National Instruments 2900 devices. The experimental results of the proposed scheme are compared with the energy detection using accuracy metric according to SNR. With simulation results, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme shows much better performance in low SNR.	artificial neural network;cognitive radio;convolution;gnu radio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;universal software radio peripheral	Gyu-Hyung Lee;Young-Doo Lee;Insoo Koo	2018	2018 Tenth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)	10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436736	convolutional neural network;real-time computing;universal software radio peripheral;cognitive radio;computer science;distributed computing;communication channel	Mobile	47.33320873531946	84.81445225766429	143897

In order to take advantage of “null” sub-carriers (guard band) in LTE systems and make the algorithm simpler, an iterative compensated MMSE (IC-MMSE) channel estimation algorithm is proposed in frequency domain. Together with a simple “linear interpolation” in time domain, channel estimates are obtained in an iterative way with lower complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that the compensation process does not affect the accuracy of iterative MMSE channel estimation. Simulation results confirm that the proposed channel estimation has very robust performance and approaches the best achievable performance.	algorithm;channel state information;compaq lte;iteration;iterative method;linear interpolation;simulation	Yang Liu;Serdar Sezginer	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6363977	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;interpolation;computer science;iterative method;linear interpolation;frequency domain;statistics	Robotics	49.42977192780934	79.7805530603228	143947

The performance of an auto-regressive, super-resolution beam forming technique is analyzed and compared with other high-resolution methods. The AR coefficients, which represent an IIR filter, are determined adaptively using the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm. A linear algebra-based analysis is developed to show that the gain in signal-to-noise ratio is determined by the order of the extrapolation filter. It is also shown that if the filter coefficients are chosen such that there are poles on the unit circle corresponding to each source present, then the interference between the sources can be eliminated. However, if a pole is not placed on the unit circle for any given source, then it may interfere with the other sources. This yields no improvement in signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. This observation is of great importance in systems such as space division multiple access (SDMA), where separating the signals from sources that utilize the same frequency resources is critical.	algorithm;beamforming;coefficient;extrapolation;image resolution;infinite impulse response;interference (communication);least mean squares filter;linear algebra;profiling (computer programming);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;smart antenna;spectral density estimation;standard database management analysis;super-resolution imaging	Honglei Chen;Dayalan Kasilingam	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2004.1327120	least mean squares filter;linear algebra;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	52.18773833725286	79.55760934110926	144055

The proposed suboptimum coherent combining (SCC) and suboptimum noncoherent combining (SNC) schemes yield similar performance as the corresponding optimum combining schemes but require a lower computational complexity. In addition, the novel SCC and SNC strategies achieve large performance gains over conventional maximum ratio combining (MRC) and equal gain combining (EGC), respectively. For MRC and EGC, respectively, we also provide a performance analysis for coherent and differential M-PSK transmissions over general Ricean fading channels with Class-A noise. Furthermore, tight performance upper bounds for the proposed optimum and suboptimum combining schemes are derived.	bit error rate;coherence (physics);computational complexity theory;key (cryptography);modulation;nef polygon;numerical method;open network computing remote procedure call;optimistic concurrency control;pre-shared key;sap netweaver;x.690	Robert Schober;Yao Ma;Lutz H.-J.

The first part of the paper considers the conventional postdetection noncoherent equal-gain combiner (NC-EGC), in which a Fourier series inversion formula is employed to derive a simple and rapidly converging series-based expression for the system average BER. This expression is valid for arbitrary values of received average signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and fading parameters. The derived expression is then compared with some existing ones in the literature, and the results show a large reduction in computational complexity, particularly when M and/or the diversity order increases. In the second part, a new noncoherent combiner is proposed to achieve improvements over the conventional NC-EGC. It is also shown that this new combiner results in a simple closed-form expression for the system average BER that is given in terms of elementary functions; hence, it can be easily numerically evaluated with noticeable computation efficiency.	bit error rate;computation;computational complexity theory;diplexer;elementary function;key (cryptography);modulation;numerical analysis;power dividers and directional couplers;signal-to-noise ratio;x.690	Redha M.

A novel scheme to estimate multiuser Fi-Wi uplink channel using uncorrelated ternary pseudo-random signals is proposed. By exploiting proper harmonic suppression through signal design, the effects of nonlinear distortion and MAI can be eliminated or reduced.	channel state information;distortion;fiber to the x;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);multi-user;multipath propagation;nonlinear system;pseudorandomness;radio over fiber;signal-to-noise ratio;software deployment;telecommunications link;transceiver;zero suppression	Yin Hoe Ng;Teong Chee Chuah;Ai Hui Tan	2012	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2012.090312.120459	nonlinear distortion;estimation;telecommunications;harmonic analysis;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics;polynomial;computer network	Mobile	48.07209696886981	80.1293677057841	144303

RD-MUD exploits the fact that the number of active users is typically small relative to the total number of users in the system and relies on ideas of analog compressed sensing to reduce the number of correlators. We first develop a general framework for both linear and nonlinear RD-MUD structures. We then present theoretical performance analysis for two specific detectors: the linear reduced-dimension decorrelating (RDD) detector, which combines subspace projection and thresholding to determine active users and sign detection for data recovery, and the nonlinear reduced-dimension decision-feedback (RDDF) detector, which combines decision-feedback orthogonal matching pursuit for active user detection and sign detection for data recovery.

In this paper, to make the optimum MUD feasible, we put together a low-complexity iterative MUD algorithm for MC-CDMA systems based on Pearl's belief propagation (BP) scheme. The BP-based MUD algorithm can be implemented in a practical time scale.

This paper introduces a recognition algorithm of digital modulation signals which based on high-order cumulants. Due to the signals of 8PSK and MFSK have the same cumulants, we can't recognize them directly. Meanwhile, the identify species of exiting method are few. So, in this paper a new method is proposed to solve the problems. The method not only has a high recognition ratio, but also it is simple and effective. And it can classify more modulation mode than exiting algorithm, including 2ASK/2PSK, 4ASK, 8ASK, 2FSK, 4FSK, 8FSK, 4PSK and 16QAM signals.

Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm is one of the most popular channel equalization algorithms and is preferred over other algorithms such as the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) and Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation (MLSE) when simplicity is a dominant decision factor. However, LMS algorithm suffers from poor performance and convergence speed within the training period specified by most of the standards. The aim of this study is to improve the convergence speed and performance of the LMS algorithm by adjusting the step size using fuzzy logic. The proposed method is compared with the Channel Matched Filter-Decision Feedback Equalizer (CMF-DFE) [1] which provides multi path propagation diversity by collecting the energy in the channel, Minimum Mean Square Error-Decision Feedback Equalizer (MMSE-DFE) [2] which is one of the most successful equalizers for the data packet transmission, normalized LMS-DFE (N-LMS-DFE) [3], variable step size (VSS) LMS-DFE [4], fuzzy LMS-DFE [5,6] and RLS-DFE [7]. The obtained simulation results using HIPERLAN/1 standards have demonstrated that the proposed LMS-DFE algorithm based on fuzzy logic has considerably better performance than others.	algorithm	Ali Özen;Ismail Kaya;Birol Soysal	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74282-1_118	least mean squares filter;computer science;machine learning;control theory	Robotics	50.18763639256613	76.13701197774905	144862

The key idea of CR is to make it possible for a wireless system to find the vacant spectrum and transfer data without interfering with licensed users (LUs). Then, OFDM is proposed as a candidate signaling technology for such applications. However, the sidelobe interference of subcarriers has become a problem. In this letter, a method for sidelobe suppressing in OFDM systems is proposed and investigated. The proposed method is based on sampling in optimal locations with optimal weights in Active Interference Cancellation (AIC). By means of this technique, the maximum interference of the target spectrum is minimized. The proposed method can be used to minimize the maximum interference to licensed users in OFDM-based cognitive radio systems. Additionally, this method can be combined with other algorithms, such as Cancellation Carriers (CCs) and Subcarrier Weighting (SW), to enhance their performance under the minimax criterion.	active galactic nucleus;algorithm;cognitive radio;computation;context tree weighting;half-band filter;interference (communication);least squares;mimo-ofdm;minimax;sampling (signal processing);shattered world;subcarrier;zero suppression	Jinping Liu;Qian Yang;Bo Cheng;Shengfeng Xu	2014	JNW	10.4304/jnw.9.5.1178-1182	cognitive radio;single antenna interference cancellation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;co-channel interference;computer network	EDA	48.22879954281941	82.33293832278035	144937
