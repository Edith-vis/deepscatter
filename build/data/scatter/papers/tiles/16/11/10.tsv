The exact value of linear complexity kð6eÞ is determined when r 1⁄4 Pw i1⁄41p ei . Furthermore, an upper bound of the linear complexity is given for the other values of r. Our results show that this sequence has larger linear span than GMW sequence with the same parameters. Finally, the results of a Maple program are included to illustrate the validity of the results. 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We characterize a class of vectorial (hyper)bent functions of the form    \(F(x)=Tr_k^n(\sum _{i=0}^{2^k}a_ix^{i(2^k-1)})\)   , where    \(n=2k\)   , in terms of finding an explicit expression for the coefficients    \(a_i\)    so that    \(F\)    is vectorial hyperbent. These coefficients only depend on the choice of the interpolating polynomial used in the Lagrange interpolation of the elements of    \(\mathcal {U}\)    and some prespecified outputs, where    \(\mathcal {U}\)    is the cyclic group of    \((2^{n/2}+1)\)   th roots of unity in    \( {\mathbb F}_{2^n}\)   . We show that these interpolation polynomials can be chosen in exactly    \((2^k+1)!2^{k-1}\)    ways and this is the exact number of vectorial hyperbent functions of the form    \(Tr^n_k(\sum _{i=0}^{2^k}a_ix^{i(2^k-1)})\)   . Furthermore, a simple optimization method is proposed for selecting the interpolation polynomials that give rise to trace polynomials with a few nonzero coefficients.

The present paper provides practical algorithms for computing such representations. We propose two different approaches. The first one uses differential characteristic decompositions whereas the second one proceeds by prolongation and algebraic elimination. Both constructions depend on the choice of a tuple over the differential base field and their success relies on the chosen tuple to be separating. The probabilistic aspect of the algorithms comes from this choice. To control it, we exhibit a family of tuples for which we can bound the probability that one of its element is separating.	algorithm;linear algebra;resolution (logic)	Thomas Cluzeau;Evelyne Hubert	2008	Applicable Algebra in Engineering, Communication and Computing	10.1007/s00200-008-0079-8	mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;differential algebra;mathematics;algebraic differential equation;randomized algorithm;algorithm;algebra	PL	47.142541131271194	36.332919715769215	79573

As an application, we solve linear systems over the integers and compare the running times with Linbox and IML.	c++;computer algebra system;lambda lifting;lazy evaluation;lifting scheme;linear algebra;linear system;newton;regular expression	Jérémy Berthomieu;Romain Lebreton	2012		10.1145/2442829.2442842	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;complexity;mathematics;power series;algorithm;algebra	Theory	47.182484581209195	38.123267254661364	79611

This capability is achieved by cyclically modifying the effective connections in the feedback loop. A description of the behavior of the classical n-stage FSR in terms of cyclic transformations on its state space X sub n is formulated and used to analyze the behavior of the proposed generalized n-stage feedback shift-register, the (m, n)-FSR. The latter is shown to be capable of producing sequences of maximal period m(2 raised to the n power) for any m and n by cyclic application of properly chosen transformations. (Author)		Irving S.

86c29654148f2c71642e0b407ed96aa4678fb9ad	weihrauch goes brouwerian		We prove that the Weihrauch lattice can be transformed into a Brouwer algebra by the consecutive application of two closure operators in the appropriate order: first completion and then parallelization. The closure operator of completion is a new closure operator that we introduce. It transforms any problem into a total problem on the completion of the respective types, where we allow any value outside of the original domain of the problem. This closure operator is of interest by itself, as it generates a total version of Weihrauch reducibility that is defined like the usual version of Weihrauch reducibility, but in terms of total realizers. From a logical perspective completion can be seen as a way to make problems independent of their premises. Alongside with the completion operator and total Weihrauch reducibility we need to study precomplete representations that are required to describe these concepts. In order to show that the parallelized total Weihrauch lattice forms a Brouwer algebra, we introduce a new multiplicative version of an implication. While the parallelized total Weihrauch lattice forms a Brouwer algebra with this implication, the total Weihrauch lattice fails to be a model of intuitionistic linear logic in two different ways. In order to pinpoint the algebraic reasons for this failure, we introduce the concept of a Weihrauch algebra that allows us to formulate the failure in precise and neat terms. Finally, we show that the Medvedev Brouwer algebra can be embedded into our Brouwer algebra, which also implies that the theory of our Brouwer algebra is Jankov logic.	brouwer fixed-point theorem;closure (computer programming);embedded system;linear algebra;linear logic;mv-algebra;parallel computing	Vasco Brattka;Guido Gherardi	2018	CoRR		combinatorics;mathematics;discrete mathematics;algebraic number;operator (computer programming);closure operator;multiplicative function;lattice (order);linear logic	DB	39.60999498825001	34.64100982687944	81418

This attack makes use of linear properties of Sboxes. In this paper, we investigate the linear properties of Sboxes, mathematically, and generalize the criteria used in linear attacks in two aspects: the first aspect introduces nonlinear criteria for Sboxes; the second aspect is generalizing linear criteria in finite fields, and also for balanced linear transformations. The first aspect, generalizes the works of Harpes, Kramer and Massey in EUROCRYPT'95 and the second aspect is a generalization of the works of Baigneres in his dissertation in 2008. Combining these two generalizations, we study generalized (nonlinear) criteria for distinguishing Sboxes from random ones. At last, we prove a theorem which we could name “Generalized Piling up Lemma”.	cipher;differential cryptanalysis;differential-linear attack;kramer graph;linear cryptanalysis;nonlinear system;piling-up lemma;symmetric-key algorithm	S.

10e1021c24bc19259949b14e94822cbbb3cc3915	the twin of a theorem by cauchy		A classical result by Cauchy determines a disk containing all the zeros of a given polynomial. We derive this result using only linear algebra techniques, and, in the process, discover a twin disk that also contains all the zeros of the polynomial. There exists a relatively well-known theorem by Cauchy ([2], [5, Th.(27,1)]) stating that all the zeros of a polynomial p(z) = zn + an−1z + · · · + a1z + a0 with complex coefficients that are not all zero are contained in the disk, centered at the origin and with a radius that is the unique positive root of the real polynomial q(x) = xn − |an−1|x − · · · − |a1|x − |a0|. The theorem is a direct consequence of Rouche’s theorem. We will show how the same result can be obtained with basic linear algebra and how, in the process of doing so, a twin of this result appears. Our two main tools, the Gershgorin set and the companion matrix of a polynomial, are easily explained. The Gershgorin set of a matrix ([3], [4, Section 6.1]) is a union of disks that contains all the eigenvalues of the matrix.

Suppose m 1, . . . , m l are all coprime to the characteristic of R and let {g 1, . . . , g t } be the set of all monic basic irreducible polynomials in the factorizations of $${x^{m_i}-1}$$ (1 ≤ i ≤ l). Then the GQC codes over R of block lengths (m 1, m 2, . . . , m l ) and length $${\sum_{i=1}^lm_i}$$ are identified with $${{\mathcal G}_1\times\cdots\times {\mathcal G}_t}$$ , where $${{\mathcal G}_j}$$ is an R[x]/(g j )-submodule of $${(R[x]/(g_j))^{n_j}}$$ , where n j is the number of i for which g j appears in the factorization of $${x^{m_i}-1}$$ into monic basic irreducible polynomials. This identification then leads to an enumeration of such GQC codes. An analogous result is also obtained for the 1-generator GQC codes. A notion of a parity-check polynomial is given when R is a finite field, and the number of GQC codes with a given parity-check polynomial is determined. Finally, an algorithm is given to compute the number of GQC codes of given block lengths.	algorithm;cathode ray tube;herman ring;irreducibility;irreducible polynomial;monic polynomial;qr code	Yonglin Cao	2011	Applicable Algebra in Engineering, Communication and Computing	10.1007/s00200-011-0145-5	irreducible polynomial;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;enumeration;finite field;algebra	Theory	41.14114800920663	38.841216738236625	82572

Recent works have shown that arithmetic on an elliptic curve in Jacobi quartic form can be performed solidly faster than the corresponding operations in Weierstrass form. These proposals use up to 7 coordinates to represent a single point. However, fast scalar multiplication algorithms based on windowing techniques, precompute and store several points which require more space than what it takes with 3 coordinates. Also note that some of these proposals require d = 1 for full speed. Unfortunately, elliptic curves having 2-times-aprime number of points, cannot be written in extended Jacobi quartic form if d = 1. Even worse the contemporary formulae may fail to output correct coordinates for some inputs. This paper provides improved speeds using fewer coordinates without causing the above mentioned problems. For instance, our proposed point doubling algorithm takes only 2 multiplications, 5 squarings, and no multiplication with curve constants when d is arbitrary and a = ±1/2.	elliptic curve cryptography;jacobi method;multiplication algorithm;period-doubling bifurcation;quartic function	Hüseyin Hisil;Kenneth Koon-Ho Wong;Gary Carter;Ed Dawson	2009	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-642-02620-1_31	supersingular elliptic curve;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;jacobian curve;tripling-oriented doche–icart–kohel curve;counting points on elliptic curves;scalar multiplication;edwards curve;mathematics;hessian form of an elliptic curve;elliptic curve;jacobi elliptic functions;elliptic curve point multiplication;quartic surface;prime number;schoof's algorithm;algebra	Crypto	45.565679512436226	40.441537750663706	83467

6d75a84cdda43a807e1bdb4bcc64411e8d23c72c	secondary constructions of bent functions and their enforcement	bent function;block cipher;boolean function;boolean permutation;orthomorphic permutation;stream cipher	Thirty years ago, Rothaus introduced the notion of bent function and presented a secondary construction (building new bent functions from already defined ones), which is now called the Rothaus construction. This construction has a strict requirement for its initial functions. In this paper, we first concentrate on the design of the initial functions in the Rothaus construction. We show how to construct Maiorana-McFarland's (M-M) bent functions, which can then be used as initial functions, from Boolean permutations and orthomorphic permutations. We deduce that at least (2 n!×2 2n)(2 2n×2 2n-1)2 bent functions in 2n+2 variables can be constructed by using Rothaus' construction. In the second part of the note, we present a new secondary construction of bent functions which generalizes the Rothaus construction. This construction requires initial functions with stronger conditions; we give examples of functions satisfying them. Further, we generalize the new secondary construction of bent functions and illustrate it with examples. © 2012 AIMS.	bent function	Claude Carlet;Fengrong Zhang;Yupu Hu	2012	Adv. in Math. of Comm.	10.3934/amc.2012.6.305	boolean function;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;permutation;bent function;block cipher;enforcement;mathematics;bent molecular geometry;stream cipher	Crypto	40.291072145233834	36.46652126393004	83569

For functions f , g on represented sets, f is W-reducible to g if f can be computed by applying the function g at most once. Let RN be the Radon-Nikodym operator on the space under consideration and let EC be the non-computable operator mapping every enumeration of a set of natural numbers to its characteristic function. We prove that for every computable measurable space, RN is W-reducible to EC, and we construct a computable measurable space for which EC is W-reducible to RN.	characteristic function (convex analysis);computability;computable analysis;computable function;radon–nikodym theorem	Mathieu Hoyrup;Cristobal Rojas;Klaus Weihrauch	2012	Computability	10.3233/COM-2012-005	diagonal lemma;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;mathematics;computable number;computable analysis	Theory	45.03423839920839	33.43272191145473	83610

The group then is shown to be a quasidirect product of that K-loop by a suitable automorphism group. The major advantage of this point of view is the existence of examples which are hoped to shed some light on the still open problem of the existence of proper neardomains. c © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

All calculations are based on exact rational algebraic methods and provide the correct mathematical results in all, even degenerate, cases. By projection, the spatial problem is reduced to the one of computing planar arrangements of algebraic curves. We succeed in locating all event points in these arrangements, including tangential intersections and singular points. By introducing an additional curve, which we call the Jacobi curve, we are able to find non-singular tangential intersections. We show that the coordinates of the singular points in our special projected planar arrangements are roots of quadratic polynomials. The coefficients of these polynomials are usually rational and contain at most a single square root. A prototypical implementation indicates that our approach leads to good performance in practice.	chebyshev polynomials;coefficient;computation;computer performance;jacobi method;linear algebra;polynomial	Nicola Wolpert	2004		10.1016/j.comgeo.2004.02.007	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;algebraic element;algebraic solution;singular point of an algebraic variety;polar curve;computational geometry;dimension of an algebraic variety;mathematics;geometry;real algebraic geometry;intersection theory;algebraic curve;algebraic surface;algebraic extension;function field of an algebraic variety;algebraic expression;algebraic function;differential algebraic geometry;algebraic cycle;algorithm;stable curve	ML	51.51470449468453	33.5315412200411	84266

The principle of the permutation-perturbation method is that, while in algebra a given algorithm provides a single result r, the same algorithm carried out on a computer provides a set R of numerical results that are all representative of the exact algebraic result r. The perturbation procedure acts on the data and result of each elementary operation, and the permutation acts on the order on which operations are carried out. A statistical procedure is used to generate r and its accuracy from a few elements of the set R. In practice the method consists in adding (or not adding) a bit in low order position of each operand and the partial and final results of a computation. The permutation procedure consists in permuting (or not) the non-associative operators in the algorithm. The software simulation of the P-P algorithm has given excellent results. We describe in this paper our approach towards incorporating this concept as a microprogrammed module. It is expected that the study will be a step towards a machine structure that will yield an evaluation of the error together with the numerical results of an algorithm.	computation;computer;firmware;linear algebra;liu hui's π algorithm;microcode;numerical analysis;operand;probabilistic turing machine;significant figures;simulation	S.

In particular, we derive conditions sufficient to imply that the only factorizations are the trivial ones (all but one factor is a permutation matrix). Such matrices are called prime. There are classes of designs with non-trivial factorizations; such designs are called factorable. These include designs arising from projective geometries and from tensor products of Hadamard matrices.

This applies to the Thompson-Higman group Tk,1 as well. We show that lpGk,1 is a “diagonal” direct limit of finite symmetric groups, and that lpTk,1 is a k ∞ Prüfer group. We find an infinite generating set of lpGk,1 which is related to reversible boolean circuits. We further investigate connections between the Thompson-Higman groups, circuits, and complexity. We show that elements of Fk,1 cannot be one-way functions. We show that describing an element of Gk,1 by a generalized bijective circuit is equivalent to describing the element by a word over a certain infinite generating set of Gk,1; word length over these generators is equivalent to generalized bijective circuit size. We give some coNP-completeness results for Gk,1 (e.g., the word problem when elements are given by circuits), and #P-completeness results (e.g., finding the lpGk,1 · Fk,1 factorization of an element of Gk,1 given by a circuit).	boolean circuit;circuit complexity;co-np;one-way function	Jean-Camille Birget	2008	IJAC	10.1142/S0218196708004457	word problem for groups;circuit complexity;boolean circuit;word problem;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;direct limit;mathematics;geometry;symmetric group;group theory;one-way function;algebra	Crypto	39.87358251945875	33.77193283523603	87465

It is shown how symbolic approaches outperform the interactive ones when dealing with loci which are algebraic curves. Additionally, two experimental improvements are reported: i) an efficient computer algebra system allows symbolically generated loci to behave as dynamic objects, and ii) a general purpose computer algebra system is used to remove spurious parts of some loci.	list of interactive geometry software	Francisco Botana	2002		10.1007/3-540-46080-2_22	discrete mathematics;symbolic computation;mathematics;geometry;algebraic curve;algorithm	Robotics	51.30537079386878	33.833486525838325	87723

It has been shown by Stinson and van Rees that this latin square contains a 2-critical set of volume 4(n) - 3(n). We provide constructions for 2-critical sets containing 4(n) - 3(n) + 1 - (2(k-1) + 2(m-1) + 2(n-(k+m+1))) entries, where 1 less than or equal to k less than or equal to n and 1 less than or equal to m less than or equal to n - k. That is, we construct 2-critical sets for certain values less than 4(n) - 3(n) + 1 - 3 (.) 2([n /3]-1). The results raise the interesting question of whether, for the given latin square, it is possible to construct 2-critical sets of volume m, where 4(n) - 3(n) + 1 - 3 (.) 2([n/3]-1) < m < 4(n) - 3(n).

Good’s proof of his theorem being analytical, <:he later authors considered Lagrange inversion within the theory of formal power series. The first attempt for a purely combinatorial proof was made by Chottin [ 1 j, who treated a special case of the two dimensional formula. Tutte gave an extensive development of this subject in [ll j for an arbitrary number of variabks. While studying Rota’s theory of polynomial sequences of binomial type (see [8,9, lo]), Cigler [2], Garsia and Joni [3 j realized its intimate connection with Lagrange inversion (in the one dimensional case); &neralizing Rota’v theory to higher dimensions they obtained an analogot:s setting for the Lagrange-Good formula (see [2,4,6,73). This paper is mainly based on these work, it follows the same ideas and gives only a simplified version of the more technical part of their proofs. Readers interested in the connection to Rota’s theory which will not be treated here are referred to the above cited papers.	binomial type;lagrange multiplier;polynomial sequence	Josef Hofbauer	1979	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/0012-365X(79)90015-3	mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;calculus;mathematics	Theory	42.868021296378956	35.26351905505491	89594

PM is based on the REFCO III list processing system, which is described and compared with the LISP and SLIP systems. The PM subroutines for arithmetic of large integers are described as constituting an independently useful subsystem.

In this article, we propose an extremely fast point counting algorithm for hyperelliptic curves of type y = x + ax over given large prime fields Fp, e.g. 80-bit fields. For these curves, we also determine the necessary condition to be suitable for HCC, that is, to satisfy that the order of the Jacobian group is of the form l · c where l is a prime number greater than about 2 and c is a very small integer. We show some examples of suitable curves for HCC obtained by using our algorithm. We also treat curves of type y = x + a where a is not square in Fp.	algorithm;cryptosystem;elliptic curve cryptography;human-centered computing	Eisaku Furukawa;Mitsuru Kawazoe;Tetsuya Takahashi	2002		10.1007/978-3-540-24654-1_3	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;counting points on elliptic curves;mathematics;family of curves;algebra	Crypto	45.309891617815865	39.12049909310595	90351

Given two binomial algebras, one important problem is to decide whether or not they are isomorphic as algebras. We study an algorithm for solving this problem, when both algebras are finite-dimensional over a field. In particular, when they are monomial algebras (i.e. binomial algebras defined by monomials only), the problem has already been completely solved by the presentation uniqueness. In this paper, we provide some necessary conditions in terms of partially ordered sets for two certain binomial algebras to be isomorphic. In other words, invariants of the binomial algebras are presented. These conditions together serve as an effective procedure for solving the isomorphism problem.	algorithm;effective method;graph isomorphism problem;invariant (computer science);mv-algebra;modulo operation;monomial	Kioshi Shirayanagi	1990		10.1145/96877.96906	partially ordered set;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;non-associative algebra;mathematics;interior algebra;nest algebra;algebra	Logic	40.37997579161586	34.12824795071491	90657

We obtain explicit formulas and combinatorial representations for the sums of terms of these sequences. Finally we represent relationships between these sequences and permanents of certain matrices. 1. Introduction The Tribonacci sequence is dened by for n > 1 Tn+1 = Tn + Tn 1 + Tn 2 where T0 = 0; T1 = 1; T2 = 1: The few rst terms are 0; 1; 1; 2; 4; 7; 13; 24; 44; 81; 149; : : : : We dene Tn = 0 for all n 0: The Tribonacci sequence is a well known generalization of the Fibonacci sequence. In (see page 527-536, [3]), one can nd some known properties of Tribonacci numbers. For example, the generating matrix of fTng is given by Q = 24 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 35n = 24 Tn+1 Tn + Tn 1 Tn Tn Tn 1 + Tn 2 Tn 1 Tn 1 Tn 2 + Tn 3 Tn 2 35 : For further properties of Tribonacci numbers, we refer to [1, 4, 5]. Let Sn = Pn k=0 Tk: (1.1) In this paper, we obtain generating matrices for the sequences fTng,fT4ng, fSng and fS4ng : (The second result follows from a third order recurrence for T4n:) We also obtain Binet-type explicit and closed-form formulas for Sn and S4n: Further on, we present relationships between permanents of certain matrices and all the above-mentioned sequences. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classication. 11B37, 15A36, 11P.	emoticon;linear code;recurrence relation	Emrah Kilic	2008	Ars Comb.		combinatorics;mathematics;organic chemistry;anthranilic acid	Theory	40.09525868860089	35.92785584088066	91552

In this paper we studied the equal-weight symmetric Boolean functions. First the Walsh spectra of the equal-weight symmetric Boolean functions are given. Second the sufficient and necessary condition on correlation-immunity of the equal-weight symmetric Boolean function is derived and other cryptology properties such as the nonlinearity, balance and propagation criterion are taken into account. In particular, the nonlinearity of the equal-weight symmetric Boolean functions with n (n ≥ 10) variables is determined by their Hamming weight. Considering these properties will be helpful in further investigations of symmetric Boolean functions.	boolean algebra;correlation immunity;cryptography;hadamard transform;hamming weight;nonlinear system;software propagation;symmetric boolean function;window function	Yu Zhou;Guozhen Xiao	2009	Frontiers of Computer Science in China	10.1007/s11704-009-0002-x	boolean algebra;circuit minimization for boolean functions;reed–muller expansion;boolean network;boolean domain;boolean expression;symmetric difference;nonlinear system;computer science;maximum satisfiability problem;karp–lipton theorem;boolean algebras canonically defined;boolean function;complete boolean algebra;algorithm;two-element boolean algebra;free boolean algebra;parity function	Theory	42.17308743651495	41.519446525663334	92383

An elliptic curve is uniquely determined by mathematical parameters such as j-invariant of an elliptic curve. By giving trace of elliptic curve, t, a definition field (mathbb F_{p}), and discriminant D, an elliptic curve with order (sharp {E(mathbb F_{p})} = n) is determined. Therefore it is an open problem to determine explicit relations between the mathematical parameters and the embedding degrees k. Hirasawa and Miyaji presented concrete relations between the mathematical parameters and the embedding degrees. In this research, a new explicit relation between elliptic-curve parameters and embedding degrees is investigated by generalizing their research.

This transformation is essentially uniquely dened by itsrst column. Furthermore, we prove that the set of Hermitian diagonal-plus-semiseparable matrices is invariant under QR iteration.

A crucial step of this method is to compute the roots of a special type of class field polynomials with the most commonly used being the Hilbert and Weber ones. These polynomials are uniquely determined by the CM discriminant D. In this paper, we consider a variant of the CM method for constructing elliptic curves (ECs) of prime order using Weber polynomials. In attempting to construct prime-order ECs using Weber polynomials, two difficulties arise (in addition to the necessary transformations of the roots of such polynomials to those of their Hilbert counterparts). The first one is that the requirement of prime order necessitates that D≡3mod8), which gives Weber polynomials with degree three times larger than the degree of their corresponding Hilbert polynomials (a fact that could affect efficiency). The second difficulty is that these Weber polynomials do not have roots in $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ . In this work, we show how to overcome the above difficulties and provide efficient methods for generating ECs of prime order focusing on their support by a thorough experimental study. In particular, we show that such Weber polynomials have roots in the extension field $\mathbb{F}_{p^{3}}$ and present a set of transformations for mapping roots of Weber polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_{p^{3}}$ to roots of their corresponding Hilbert polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ . We also show how an alternative class of polynomials, with degree equal to their corresponding Hilbert counterparts (and hence having roots in $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ ), can be used in the CM method to generate prime-order ECs. We conduct an extensive experimental study comparing the efficiency of using this alternative class against the use of the aforementioned Weber polynomials. Finally, we investigate the time efficiency of the CM variant under four different implementations of a crucial step of the variant and demonstrate the superiority of two of them.	chebyshev polynomials;computation;discriminant;elliptic curve cryptography;experiment;polynomial;shapiro polynomials;time complexity	Elisavet Konstantinou;Aristides Kontogeorgis;Yannis C.

The para-orthogonal polynomials in the three term recurrence formula are such that their zeros are also dierent from z = 1. The two zeros of any of these para-orthogonal polynomials lying on either side of the point z = 1 will be referred to as the extreme zeros. The main objective of the present manuscript is to nd bounds for the extreme zeros of such para-orthogonal polynomials in terms of the coecients of their three term recurrence formula, thus in turn, also in terms of the Verblunsky coecients. Using the limiting behaviour of these extreme zeros, bounds for the support of the associated measure are also found. Using a measure obtained after a rotation of the original measure, results about the bounds for any gap within the support are also given. Examples are provided to justify these results.	polynomial	Andrei Martínez-Finkelshtein;A. Sri Ranga;D. O. Veronese	2018	Math.

In particular, results given here completely solve the problem of analyzing Extendible Hashing for which practical conclusions are given. The treatment relies on the saddle point method of complex analysis which is used here for extracting coefficients of a probability generating function, and on a particular technique that reveals periodic fluctuations in the behaviour of algorithms which are precisely quantified.	factorization of polynomials;hash function;polynomial;trie	Philippe Flajolet;Jean-Marc Steyaert	1982		10.1007/BFb0012773	branching process;mathematical optimization;generating function;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;factorization of polynomials;square-free polynomial;algebra	Theory	50.0658270917194	39.154664390116665	94932

We show that the use of k-bent functions as ciphering functions extremely increases the resistance of ciphers to such approximations. We consider examples of 4-bit permutations recommended for use in S-boxes of the algorithms GOST 28147-89, DES, and sDES; we show that in almost all cases there exist more probable (than linear) quadratic relations of a special form on input and output bits of these permutations.

An immediate consequence of this is the existence of an absolute upper bound upon min {vp(∆(E)) : p | ∆(E)}. In this paper, we will prove this local version of Szpiro’s Conjecture under the (admittedly strong) additional hypotheses that N(E) is divisible by a “large” prime p, and that E possesses a nontrivial rational isogeny. We will also formulate a related conjecture which, if true, we prove to be sharp. Our construction of families of curves for which min {vp(∆(E)) : p | ∆(E)} ≥ 6 provides an alternative proof of a result of Masser on the sharpness of Szpiro’s conjecture. We close the paper by reporting on recent computations of examples of curves with large Szpiro ratio.	computation;discriminant;maxima and minima;modulus of continuity	Michael A.

Recognizing loci means determining a single implicit polynomial equation and geometric invariants, characterizing an algebraic curve which is given by a discrete set of sample points. Starting with these discrete samples arising from a geometric ruler and compass construction an eigenvalue analysis of a matrix derived from the data leads to proposed curve parameters. Utilizing the construction itself, with its free and dependent geometric elements, further specifications of the type of constructed curves under generitcity assumptions are made. This is done by a second eigenvalue analysis of parameters of several generically generated curves.	algebraic equation;algorithm;coefficient;linear algebra;polynomial;preconditioner	Peter Lebmeir;Jürgen Richter-Gebert	2006		10.1007/978-3-540-77356-6_4	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;geometric design;computer science;mathematics	Theory	50.79204200954691	33.74822040931198	95891

Starting with a given partition μ, we deduce several skew diagrams which are related to μ. To each such skew diagram there corresponds the product of its hook numbers. By asymptotic methods we obtain some unexpected arithmetic properties between these products. The authors do not know ”finite”, nonasymptotic proofs of these results. The problem appeared in the study of the hook formula for various kinds of Young diagrams. The proofs are based on properties of shifted Schur functions, due to Okounkov and Olshanski. The theory of these functions arose from the asymptotic theory of Vershik and Kerov of the representations of the symmetric groups. ∗ Work partially supported by N.S.F.

94f56d87f299fff00b3cf8fb90e84c43d7ac0850	the nearest polynomial to multiple given polynomials with a given zero	nearest polynomial	The following type of problems have been well-studied in the area of symbolic-numeric computation for about twenty years: Given a polynomial f ∈ C[x] and a point z ∈ C, find the nearest polynomial f̃ ∈ C[x] to f with f̃(z) = 0. A common framework for such problems is described in [7]. In previous works, for example [3, 4, 7, 6], problems for one given polynomial were considered. Here, we consider a problem for multiple given polynomials. Through observation or by using different numerical algorithms for a given input data, we may obtain multiple polynomials being equal in theory but being slightly different each other. Thus, it is worth considering the problem for multiple polynomials. In this abstract, after the preliminaries, we define the nearest polynomial to multiple given polynomials. In the definition, we use a pair of norms to measure the nearness between polynomials. We remark the difficulty of the problem of finding the nearest polynomial depends on the norm pair. Finally, we describe an algorithm for the problem when both of the norms are the ∞-norm.	algorithm;numerical analysis;polynomial;symbolic-numeric computation	Hiroshi Sekigawa	2014		10.1145/2631948.2631975	irreducible polynomial;polynomial matrix;symmetric polynomial;lagrange polynomial;homogeneous polynomial;elementary symmetric polynomial;alternating polynomial;stable polynomial;wilkinson's polynomial;resultant;degree of a polynomial;monic polynomial;factorization of polynomials;matrix polynomial;minimal polynomial;characteristic polynomial;reciprocal polynomial;polynomial remainder theorem;square-free polynomial;polynomial	Theory	47.24776258907819	36.48997146775805	96740

Quasigroups are a well-known combinatorial design equivalent to the more familiar Latin squares. One of their most important properties is that all possible elements of certain quasigroup occur with equal probability. The quasigroups are evolved within a framework of a simple hash function. Prior implementations of quasigroups were based on look-up table of the quasigroup, which is infeasible for large quasigroups. In contrast, analytic quasigroup can be implemented easily. It allows the evaluation of hash function without storing large amount of data (look-up table) and the concept of homotopy enables consideration of many quasigropus.	genetic algorithm;hash function;lookup table	Václav Snásel;Ajith Abraham;Jiri Dvorský;Eliska Ochodkova;Jan Platos;Pavel Krömer	2009	2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)	10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393520	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;genetic algorithm;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;group theory	AI	41.39209756948871	44.39359149305921	97354

The same numbers appear as exceptional discriminants for which no indecomposable positive definite binary quadratic form exists, as shown in [Zhu and Shao 88] and [Peters 91]. We show the equivalence of the two problems. An indecomposable binary positive definite quadratic form with discrimant d (in the terminology of O’Meara [O’Meara 63]) exists iff d = ac− b with positive integers a, b, c with the reduction conditions 2b ≤ a ≤ c. In other words: d is represented by the ternary quadratic form xy − z with positive integers x, y, z with 2z ≤ x ≤ y. We show that this is equivalent to a representation of d by xy + yz + zx with positive integers.

The bound is proved to be tight for functions up to 10 input variables. As a consequence, we present a strategy to modify the bent functions, by toggling some of its outputs, in getting a large class of 1-resilient functions with very good nonlinearity and autocorrelation. In particular, the technique is applied upto 12-variable functions and we show that the construction provides a large class of 1-resilient functions reaching currently best known nonlinearity and achieving very low autocorrelation values which were not known earlier. The technique is sound enough to theoretically solve some of the mysteries of 8-variable, 1-resilient functions with maximum possible nonlinearity. However, the situation becomes complicated from 10 variables and above, where we need to go for complicated combinatorial analysis with trial and error using computational facility.	autocorrelation;bent function;nonlinear system	Soumen Maity;Subhamoy Maitra	2003	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-540-25937-4_10	uniform boundedness;combinatorics;bent function;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	Crypto	42.27845656990875	42.91674754407366	98444

In order to do this we investigate the measure of a more general Laurent polynomial Pa,b,c(x, y) = a ( x + 1 x ) + b ( y + 1 y ) + c and show that the wanted quantity m(P ) is related to a “half-Mahler” measure of P̃ (x, y) = P7,1,3(x, y).

Then we analyze the exact t-value of generalized Niederreiter sequences and we show that, for a range of dimensions of practical interest, Niederreiter–Xing sequences are demonstrably better than Sobol’ sequences in terms of the exact t-value.

It yields a unique additive decomposition that allows to decide hyperexponential integrability. Based on this reduction algorithm, we design a new algorithm to compute minimal telescopers for bivariate hyperexponential functions. One of its main features is that it can avoid the costly computation of certificates. Its implementation outperforms Maple's function DEtools[Zeilberger].

In this note we are interested in the property of semi-bentness of Boolean functions defined on the Galois field F2n (n even) with multiple trace terms obtained via Niho functions and two Dillon-like functions (the first one has been studied by Mesnager and the second one have been studied very recently by Wang, Tang, Qi, Yang and Xu). We subsequently give a connection between the property of semi-bentness and the number of rational points on some associated hyperelliptic curves. We use the hyperelliptic curve formalism to reduce the computational complexity in order to provide a polynomial time and space test leading to an efficient characterization of semi-bentness of such functions (which includes an efficient characterization of the hyperbent functions proposed by Wang et al.). The idea of this approach goes back to the recent work of Lisoněk on the hyperbent functions studied by Charpin and Gong.	computational complexity theory;dillon's rolling western;formal grammar;hadamard transform;semiconductor industry;time complexity;yang	Sihem Mesnager	2011	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-642-33481-8_2	arithmetic;discrete mathematics;hyperelliptic curve cryptography;mathematics;hyperelliptic curve;algebra	Crypto	43.799309805386834	40.01982082368797	99771

It has recently been extended to compute Iwahori-Hecke algebra characters and Brauer algebra characters. It is proved using the fact that the symmetric group L f and the general linear group GL ( r , C ) centralize each other on the tensor space ⊗ f V of f copies of the natural representation V of GL ( r , C ). This tensor space contains the polynomial representations of GL ( r , C ). The mixed tensor space T m , n = (⊗ m V ) ⊗ (⊗ n V∗ , where V∗ is the dual to V , contains the rational representations of GL ( r , C ). When r ⩾ m + n , its centralizer is the complex algebra B m, n r which is a subalgebra of the Brauer algebra B m + n r . If we let V q = V ⊗ C ( q ), then T q m , n = (⊗ m V q ) ⊗ (⊗ n V q ∗ ) contains the rational representations of the quantum group U q ( gl ( r , C )), and when r ⩾ m + n its centralizer is the two-parameter Iwahori-Hecke algebra H m , n r ( q ). We derive a combinatorial rule for computing B m, n r -characters and H m, n r ( q )-characters, and use it to compute character tables. The Murnaghan-Nakayama rules for L m and the Iwahori-Hecke algebra H m ( q ) are obtained as the special case when n = 0.		Tom Halverson	1995	J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

We study two methods unexplored so far, in spite of intensive recent work in this area. Correlation to numerical Pride approximation enables us to improve computations for both problems (gcds and Pade). Reduction to approximating polynomial zeros enables us to obtain a new insight into the gcd problem and to devise effective solution algorithms. Unlike the known algorithms, we bound the degree of approximate gcds at a low computational cost and certify the correctness of the solution for a large class of inputs. We also restate the problem in terms of the perturbation of te zeros (rather than coefficients) of the input polynomials, which always leads us to certified solution via the computation of maximum matchings or connected components in the associated bipartite	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;coefficient;computation;connected component (graph theory);control system;correctness (computer science);linear algebra;network theory;numerical analysis;padé approximant;polynomial ring	Victor Y.

c8367eb2f9b0fc8ea4957047c3c13ccfc78b5bb1	the anti-field-descent method	circulant hadamard matrices;cyclotomic integers;barker sequences	The essential fact behind the so-called field-descent method is that certain cyclotomic integers necessarily are contained in relatively small fields and thus must have relatively small complex modulus. In this paper, we develop a method which reveals a complementary phenomenon: certain cyclotomic integers cannot be contained in relatively small fields and thus must have relatively large complex modulus. This method, in particular, yields progress towards the circulant Hadamard matrix conjecture. In fact, we show that such matrices give rise to certain “twisted cyclotomic integers” which often have small complex modulus, but are not contained in small fields. Hence our “anti-field-descent” method provides new necessary conditions for the existence of circulant Hadamard matrices. The application of the new conditions to previously open cases of Barker sequences shows that there is no Barker sequence of length ` with 13 < ` ≤ 4 · 1033. Furthermore, 229,682 of the 237,807 known open cases of the Barker sequence conjecture are ruled out. ∗Ka Hin Leung’s research is supported by grant No. R-146-000-209-112, Ministry of Education, Singapore.	circulant matrix;modulus of continuity;modulus robot;twisted pair	Ka Hin Leung;Bernhard Schmidt	2016	J.

62c7a1c25a50197d792ab0c97f7059b35634ca19	modular algorithms for computing minimal associated primes and radicals of polynomial ideals		In this paper, we propose algorithms for computing minimal associated primes of ideals in polynomial rings over Q and computing radicals of ideals in polynomial rings over a field. They apply Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to Laplagne's algorithm which computes minimal associated primes without producing redundant components and computes radicals. CRT reconstructs an object in a ring from its modular images in the quotient rings modulo some ideals. In Laplagne's algorithm, ideals are decomposed over rational function fields by regarding some variables as parameters. In our new algorithms, we compute the minimal associated primes and the radical of < φ(G) > for a given ideal I= < G >, where φ is a substitution map for a parameter. Then we construct candidates of the minimal associated primes and the radical of I by applying CRT for those of < φ(G) >'s. In order for this method to work correctly, the shape of each modular component must coincide with that of the corresponding component of the ideal for computations of minimal associated primes, and radicals of modular images of given ideals must coincide with modular images of radicals of given ideals for radical computations. The former is realized with a high probability because a multivariate irreducible polynomial over Q remains irreducible after a substitution of integers for variables with a high probability and the latter is realized except for a finite number of moduli.	algorithm;cathode ray tube;computation;irreducibility;irreducible polynomial;modulo operation;polynomial remainder theorem;polynomial ring	Toru Aoyama;Masayuki Noro	2018		10.1145/3208976.3209014	irreducible polynomial;discrete mathematics;computer science;combinatorics;chinese remainder theorem;polynomial ring;algorithm;polynomial;rational function;gröbner basis;quotient;integer	Theory	44.257932933803524	40.93581808050614	102510

We generalise the algorithm to the case of an even degree model. We also analyse the adaptation of working with the x^idx/y^3 rather than the x^idx/y differential basis. This basis has the computational advantage of always leading to an integral transformation matrix whereas the latter fails to in small genus cases. There are some theoretical subtleties that arise in the even degree case where the two differential bases actually lead to different redundant eigenvalues that must be discarded.	algorithm	Michael C.

Our approach is based on the method introduced by Kasami in [1], using Pless identities. By interpreting some equations, we obtain a necessary condition for a coset to have a “high” minimum weight. Most notably, we are able to distinguish such cosets which have three weights only. We then apply our results to the problem of the nonlinearity of Boolean functions. We particularly study the links between this criterion and the propagation characteristics of a function.	boolean algebra;cryptography;minimum weight;nonlinear system;reed–muller code;software propagation;tadao kasami	Anne Canteaut;Claude Carlet;Pascale Charpin;Caroline Fontaine	2001	IEEE Trans.

Usually, no error estimates are added and even those algorithms which work reliable in theory, become unreliable in practice due to rounding errors and the use of fixed length floating point numbers. In this paper we prove the existence of polynomial time algorithms to approximate the Julia sets of given hyperbolic rational functions. We will give a strict computable error estimation w.r.t. the Hausdorff metric on the complex sphere. This extends a result on polynomials z 7→ z2 + c, where |c| < 1/4, in [RW03] and an earlier result in [Zho98] on the recursiveness of the Julia sets of hyperbolic polynomials. The algorithm given in this paper computes Julia sets locally in time O(k ·M(k)) (where M(k) denotes the time needed to multiply two k-bit numbers). Roughly speaking, the local time complexity is the number of Turing machine steps to decide a set of disks of spherical diameter 2−k so that the union of these disks has Hausdorff distance at most 2−k+2. This allows to give reliable pictures of Julia sets to arbitrary precision.	approximation algorithm;arbitrary-precision arithmetic;computable function;computer program;hausdorff dimension;julia set;polynomial;recursion (computer science);round-off error;rounding;time complexity;turing machine	Robert Rettinger	2005	Electr.

3ac3d42a20db56572a3db52bf89a9c72e17a83d0	a necessary condition of nonminimal aubry-mather sets for monotone recurrence relations	aubry mather set;nonminimal birkhoff solution;monotone recurrence relation	In this paper, we discuss a necessary condition for nonminimal Aubry–Mather sets for monotone recurrence relations, e.g. one-dimensional Frenkel– Kontorova (F–K) model with long range interactions [Angenent, 1990; Blank, 1989; de la Llave & Valdinoci, 2007a, 2010; Mramor & Rink, 2012, 2013]. In fact, for exact area-preserving monotone twist maps on the cylinder or the standard F–K model with nearest-neighbor interactions [Aubry & Le Daeron, 1983], Mather has investigated this problem in both directions [Mather, 1985]. Mather has proved that if there is no invariant circle with irrational rotation number ω, then there are uncountably many distinct Denjoy minimal sets of rotation number ω. The word “minimal” here means that each orbit in the set is dense. Actually, the Denjoy minimal set defined in [Mather, 1985] is similar to the Aubry–Mather set defined in [Katok & Hasselblatt, 1995], see also the definition of Aubry–Mather sets in [Arnaud, 2011]. We remark that the Aubry–Mather sets found by Golé’s method [Golé, 1992] are not necessarily composed of action minimizing orbits, see also [Koch et al., 1997]. Meanwhile, according to the Aubry–Mather theory for area-preserving monotone twist maps, for each irrational ω in the twist interval, there exists at most one minimal Aubry–Mather set with rotation number ω, in which the word “minimal” indicates that the Aubry–Mather set consists of action minimizing orbits, see Corollary 13.3.11 in [Katok & Hasselblatt, 1995]. Mather’s result in [Mather, 1985], shows that a sufficient condition for the existence of Denjoy minimal sets consisting of nonminimal orbits with irrational rotation number ω, is the nonexistence of the invariant circle with rotation number ω. A similar problem has been studied by Bessi for elliptic integrand setting [Bessi, 2005], he constructed many nonminimal nonself-intersecting solutions under the barrier hypothesis, which essentially says that the Birkhoff (nonself-intersecting)	birkhoff interpolation;cylinder seal;interaction;koch snowflake;linear algebra;map;recurrence relation;rotation number;monotone	Yanan Wang;Wen-Xin Qin	2014	I.

The difficulty arises from the relative scarcity of suitable boolean functions as the size of the S-box increases. We describe the construction of cryptographically strong 5×5 S-boxes using near-bent boolean functions of five variables. These functions, where the number of variables is odd, possess highly desirable cryptographic properties and can be generated easily and systematically. Moreover, the S-boxes they compose are shown to satisfy all the important design criteria. Further, we feel that it is possible to generalize near-bent functions to any odd number of variables, thereby making construction of yet larger S-boxes feasible.	s-box;strong cryptography	John Detombe;Stafford E.

It is possible to manufacture high- performance display products by using high integrated devices such as mobile application. However, there is a certain limitation to the downsizing technology. Therefore, new device synthesis techniques are becoming important. In this paper, we propose a device design that combines inorganic material based light- emitting diode (LED) and thin-film transistor (TFT). By integrating the LED and TFT devices into one region, it is possible to highly integrate the devices, which can greatly reduce the size of the entire device. To investigate a possibility of device implementation, technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation is used. After that, an optical and electrical characteristic of the device are analyzed.

Although it is unproved that this can be done for all N , a heuristic analysis shows that the algorithm has an expected run time that is polynomial in 2ω(N) log N , where ω(N) is the number of distinct prime factors of N . In the cryptographically relevant case where N is prime, an expected run time O((log N)4+ε) can be achieved.

One can treat the problem of finding non-holonomic overideals as a generalization of the problem of factoring a linear partial differential operator. The main result states that a principal ideal <i>J</i> = <<i>P</i>> generated by an operator <i>P</i> with a separable symbol <i>symb</i>(<i>P</i>) has a finite number of maximal non-holonomic overideals; the symbol is an algebraic polynomial in two variables. This statement is extended to non-holonomic ideals <i>J</i> with a separable symbol. As an application we show that in case of a second-order operator <i>P</i> the ideal <<i>P</i>> has an infinite number of maximal non-holonomic overideals iff <i>P</i> is essentially ordinary. In case of a third-order operator <i>P</i> we give sufficient conditions on <<i>P</i>> in order to have a finite number of maximal non-holonomic overideals. In the Appendix we study the problem of finding non-holonomic overideals of a principal ideal generated by a second order operator, the latter being equivalent to the Laplace problem. The possible application of some of these results for concrete factorization problems is pointed out.	integer factorization;maximal set;non-repudiation;polynomial	Dima Grigoriev;Fritz Schwarz	2010		10.1145/1837934.1837957	symbol of a differential operator;differential operator;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;mathematics;second-order logic;algebra;elliptic operator	Theory	45.0649205302396	35.99367323523939	105912

We consider the statement of whether symmetry of information holds in a polynomial time bounded environment. Intuitively, this problem is related the complexity of inverting a polynomial time computable function. We give some evidence supporting this intuition, by proving the following relations:    1.    If the polynomial time symmetry of information holds, then there is a polynomial time algorithm that computes the shortest description of a string for almost all strings.       2.    If the polynomial time symmetry of information holds, then every polynomial time computable function is probabilistic polynomial time invertible for almost all strings in its domain.       3.    If P=NP (i.e., every polynomial time computable function is polynomial time invertible), then the polynomial time symmetry of information holds.        	p (complexity);time complexity	Luc Longpré;Osamu Watanabe	1992		10.1007/3-540-56279-6_93	time complexity;polynomial matrix;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;bracket polynomial;invariant polynomial;symmetric polynomial;polynomial function theorems for zeros;homogeneous polynomial;alternating polynomial;computer science;stable polynomial;wilkinson's polynomial;degree of a polynomial;mathematics;polynomial long division;monic polynomial;matrix polynomial;characteristic polynomial;minimal polynomial;reciprocal polynomial;polynomial remainder theorem;square-free polynomial;algorithm;polynomial	Theory	45.39529356504991	36.17125947305651	107732

Large clusters of mutually symmetric variables are more advantageous than small clusters. One way to extend the symmetry of a function is to detect abstract two-cofactor relations in addition to ordinary symmetric relations. Unfortunately, ordinary symmetries are simply transitive but more complex types of relations are not. This paper shows how to convert the more complex relations into ordinary symmetries, allowing them to be used to form large clusters of symmetric variables, larger than would be possible using ordinary symmetries.	state space	Peter M.

65b48e32999025adcb0abc0152abe5a6084be788	critical point methods and effective real algebraic geometry: new results and trends	critical point method;real algebraic geometry	Critical point methods are at the core of the interplay between polynomial optimization and polynomial system solving over the reals. These methods are used in algorithms for solving various problems such as deciding the existence of real solutions of polynomial systems, performing one-block real quantifier elimination, computing the real dimension of the solution set, etc. The input consists of s polynomials in n variables of degree at most D. Usually, the complexity of the algorithms is (sD) ) where α is a constant. In the past decade, tremendous efforts have been deployed to improve the exponents in the complexity bounds. This led to efficient implementations and new geometric procedures for solving polynomial systems over the reals that exploit properties of critical points. In this talk, we present an overview of these techniques and their impact on practical algorithms. Also, we show how we can tune them to exploit algebraic and geometric structures in two fundamental problems. The first one is real root finding of determinants of n-variate linear matrices of size k × k. We introduce an algorithm whose complexity is polynomial in ( n+k k ) (joint work with S. Naldi and D. Henrion). This improves the previously known k bound. The second one is about computing the real dimension of a semialgebraic set. We present a probabilistic algorithm with complexity (sD), that improves the long-standing (sD) ) bound obtained by Koiran (joint work with E. Tsigaridas).	critical point (network science);linear algebra;mathematical optimization;quantifier (logic);randomized algorithm;root-finding algorithm;system of polynomial equations	Mohab Safey El Din	2013		10.1145/2465506.2465928	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;singular point of an algebraic variety;galois geometry;mathematics;geometry;real algebraic geometry;function field of an algebraic variety;differential algebraic geometry;algebraic geometry and analytic geometry	Theory	49.65734431274647	37.83781832997005	111331
b2b3cac854b6925b6648c0936b622be1fe684bec	indefinite sums of rational functions	rational function	We propose a new algorithm for indefinite rational summa-tion which, given a rational function F(z), extracts a rational part R(z) from the indefinite sum of F(z): If H(x) is not equal to O then the denominator of this rational function has the lowest possible degree. We then solve the same probleme in the g-difference case. 1 The decomposition problem We discuss here the problem of indefinite summation of rational functions. This problem is equivalent to the problem of solving the difference equation y(z + 1) – y(z) = F(z) (1) where F(z) is a rational function over a field K of characteristic O. The decomposition problem is to find whether (1) has a rational solution, and if it does not, then to extract an additive rational part l?(x) from the solution s.t. the remaining part satisfies a simpler difference equation, where the denominator of the new right-hand side has the lowest possible degree. This gives an equality ~F(z) = R(Lz)+ ~H(z) (2) values then we can use some integer bounds s < t for our sums: t t It is probable that the publication [Abr75] was the first in which the rational and nonrational parts were computed in an algorithmic way. In [Pau93], P. Paule introduced the concept of shift-saturated extension which allows one to give some useful explicit formulas, and presented two new algorithms to construct (2). One works iteratively and is similar to Hermite's algorithm. The other is an analogue of the algorithm of Ostrogradsky. Neither of them requires full factorization of polynomials. Our old algorithm [Abr75] works iteratively. In the next paragraph we discuss a new algorithm which is an analogue of the algorithm of Ostrogradsky. We will compare it with Paule's algorithm. 2 A new algorithm to solve the decomposition problem We can assume that F(x) is a proper rational function (the degree of its numerator is lower than the degree of the denominator). If the degree of the numerator of F(x) is not lower than the degree of its denominator, then one can extract the polynomial part p(x) from F(z): F(z) = p(z) + F*(z), where H(z) is a rational function whose denominator has the lowest possible degree.

This is accomplished by realising each number (representing a message unit) as a point in a product of affine spaces over various finite fields. Then algebro-geometric transformations on those spaces is transported back to provide encryption. For a specific block size < 2 128 we get more than 2 5478 keys.	block size (cryptography);encryption;spaces;symmetric-key algorithm	P.

The cardinality of these pure gaps is explicitly investigated. In particular, the numbers of gaps and pure gaps at a pair of distinct places are determined precisely, which can be regarded as an extension of the previous work by Matthews (2001) considered Hermitian curves. Additionally, some concrete examples are provided to illustrate our results.

For some small values of $$k$$ , the upper bounds on the $$k$$ -error linear complexity are derived, which are far less than their linear complexity. Finally the bounds on the autocorrelation of these sequences are also presented. Our results show that there exist some drawbacks in application of these two sequences.	autocorrelation;control theory;cryptography;existential quantification	Lin Tan;Hong A Xu;Wen-Feng Qi	2012	Applicable Algebra in Engineering, Communication and Computing	10.1007/s00200-012-0177-5	combinatorics;pure mathematics;mathematics;algebra	Logic	42.81811711081299	40.21304475627976	112705

It is shown that for polynomials which are completely dense an algorithm based upon evaluation and interpolation is more efficient than Horner's method. Then various characterizations for sparse polynomials are made and the subsequent methods are re-analyzed. In conclusion a test is devised which takes only linear time to compute and by which a decision can automatically be made concerning whether to use a substitution algorithm which exploits sparsity or one which assumes relatively dense inputs. This choice yields the method which takes the fewest arithmetic operations.	algorithm;chebyshev polynomials;horner's method;interpolation;polynomial;sparse matrix;time complexity	Ellis Horowitz	1973		10.1145/800192.805697	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	48.63781195621216	39.58195957410902	112788

This conjecture is about the number of primitive σ -LFSRs of a given order over a finite field, and it generalizes a known formula for the number of primitive LFSRs, which, in turn, is the number of primitive polynomials of a given degree over a finite field. Moreover, this conjecture is intimately related to an open question of Niederreiter (Finite Fields Appl 1:3–30, 1995) on the enumeration of splitting subspaces of a given dimension.	polynomial;shift register	Sudhir R.

38bed57bfbe6132482e6c13062463a0dbd7f7148	asymptotically fast solution of toeplitz-like singular linear systems	linear system	The Toeplitz-likeness of a matrix (Kailath et al. 1979) is the generalization of the notion that a matrix is Toeplitz. Block matrices with Toeplitz blocks, such as the Sylvester matrix corresponding to the resultant of two univariate polynomials, are Toeplitz-like, as are products and inverses of Toeplitz-like matrices. The displacement rank of a matrix is a measure for the degree of being Toeplitz-like. For example, an r × s block matrix with Toeplitz blocks has displacement rank r+s whereas a generic N × N matrix has displacement rank N . A matrix of displacement rank α can be implicitly represented by a sum of α matrices, each of which is the product of a lower triangular and an upper triangular Toeplitz matrices. Such a ΣLU representation can usually be obtained efficiently. We consider the problem of computing a solution to a possibly singular linear system Ax = b with coefficients in an arbitrary field, where A is an N ×N matrix of displacement rank α given in ΣLU representation. By use of randomization we show that if the system is solvable we can find a vector that is uniformly sampled from the solution manifold in O(αN(log N) loglog N) expected arithmetic operations in the field of entries. In case no solution exists, this fact is discovered by our algorithm. In asymptotically the same time we can also compute the rank of A and the determinant of a non-singular A. Toeplitz and Toeplitz-like matrices and the corresponding linear systems are ubiquitous in control theory, of course, but also in symbolic computation.

e63c13970d0a6b5a820ae4f8be2b903ad82f14f7	on indifferentiable hashing into the jacobian of hyperelliptic curves of genus 2		Many authors have studied the problem of constructing indifferentiable and deterministic hash functions into elliptic and hyperelliptic curves with well-distributed encodings. In this work, we have designed three encodings suitable for indifferentiable hashing for the following hyperellitic curves of genus 2: (mathbb {H}^{1}: y^{2}=F_{1}(x)=x^{5}+ax^{4}+cx^{2}+dx,  mathbb {H}^{2}: y^{2}=F_{2}(x)=x^{5}+bx^{3}+dx+e;  mathbb {H}^{3}: y^{2}=F_{3}(x)=x^{5}+ax^{4}+e). Since they are well-distributed, our encodings can be used to design indifferentiable and deterministic hash functions into the Jacobian of these hyperelliptic curves, using the technique developed by Farashahi et al. in 2013 (J. Math. Comput). Because of square rooting steps, these new encodings have the same asymptotic complexity as the work of Kammerer et al. at Pairing 2010, namely (mathcal {O}(log ^{2+circ (1)}q)).	cryptographic hash function;jacobian matrix and determinant	Michel Seck;Hortense Boudjou;Nafissatou Diarra;Ahmed Youssef Ould Cheikh Khlil	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-57339-7_12	jacobian matrix and determinant;topology;hash function;hyperelliptic curve;algebra;mathematics;hyperelliptic curve cryptography;pairing	Crypto	44.39676407972417	39.75558916820829	113535
7b1e30c5bdd3ccda4ed1add4e168f8c2a9cb24c2	multivariate splines and algebraic geometry		Multivariate splines are effective tools in numerical analysis and approximation theory. Despite an extensive literature on the subject, there remain open questions in finding their dimension, constructing local bases, and determining their approximation power. Much of what is currently known was developed by numerical analysts, using classical methods, in particular the so-called Bernstein-Bézier techniques. Due to their many interesting structural properties, splines have become of keen interest to researchers in commutative and homological algebra and algebraic geometry. Unfortunately, these communities have not collaborated much. The purpose of the half-size workshop is to intensify the interaction between the different groups by bringing them together. This could lead to essential breakthroughs on several of the above problems Mathematics Subject Classification (2010): 41A15, 13D40, 52C99. Introduction by the Organisers The workshop Multivariate Splines and Algebraic Geometry, was attended by 26 researchers interested in multivariate splines, polynomial approximation and algebraic geometry. A key problem in both pure and applied mathematics is to construct finite dimensional spaces of functions that are capable of approximating complicated or unknown functions well. Such spaces are especially important for scientific computing, where they are used in computer-aided geometric design, data fitting, and the solution of partial differential equations by the finite-element method. Historically, polynomials have played the central role, but more recently 1140 Oberwolfach Report 21/2015 it has been recognized that spaces of piecewise polynomials are much more efficient and effective. A C-differentiable piecewise polynomial function on a ddimensional simplicial complex ∆ ⊆ R is called a spline. Let S k(∆) denote the vector space of C splines on a fixed ∆, where each individual polynomial has degree at most k. But before we can use spline spaces, we need to solve several basic problems such as finding their dimension, constructing local bases, and determining their approximation power. Despite an extensive literature on the subject, there remain open questions in all of these areas. Much of what is currently known was developed by approximation theorists, using methods of classical analysis, in particular the so-called Bernstein-Bézier techniques. However, due to their many interesting structural properties, splines have also become of keen interest to researchers in commutative and homological algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and topology. Unfortunately, these various communities had not collaborated much. The main purpose of the workshop was to intensify the interaction between the different groups. We believe that the workshop brought together the two communities and fostered fruitful collaborations between individual researchers. We expect that such collaborations and the combined use of tools from the various mathematical fields will lead to essential breakthroughs on several of the above problems. The workshop began with a pair of introductory lecture series: Algebraic geometry for approximators and Approximation theory for geometers. These lectures established a firm grounding in common language and tools. We also held two open problems sessions that took place in the evenings. They highlighted the key conjectures as well. Several exciting new areas were discussed, such as T-Splines and the study of splines on polyhedral (rather than simplicial) complexes. We believe that the workshop generated strong ties between the two communities, and also emphasized to the younger participants the need for interdisciplinary techniques.

Smallest error tolerances for the case of eighth roots of unity are derived using a geometric argument. Scale factors involved are reduced from \alpha to \sqrt{\alpha} for this case with roughly the same percentage errors. The case of sixteenth roots of unity gives even better range reductions and is considered only briefly.	approximation;linear algebra	Richard A. Games	1985	IEEE Trans.

In this direction, we present a new algorithm, called UGS, which takes as input a finite set of parametric polynomials and outputs a universal Grobner system for the ideal generated by input polynomials, by decomposing the space of parameters into a finite set of parametric cells and for each cell associating a finite set of parametric polynomials which is a universal Grobner basis for the ideal corresponding to that cell. Indeed, for each values of parameters satisfying a condition set, the corresponding polynomial set forms a universal Grobner basis for the ideal. Our method relies on the parametric variant of the Grobner basis conversion and also on the PGBMain algorithm due to Kapur et al. to compute parametric Grobner bases. The proposed UGS algorithm has been implemented in Maple-Sage and its performance is investigated through an example.

The guest editors selected sixteen contributions covering various areas within these themes, ranging from public-key cryptography to matters related to key distribution and authentication, from problems in graph theory to resolvability issues in designs, from finite projective planes to higher-dimensional geometries. Many problems in these areas share common methods, including purely combinatorial techniques, but also algebraic methods for finite fields, geometric issues mainly involving incidence and collineations, and computational approaches. The papers “Projective k-arcs and 2-level secret-sharing schemes” by Korchmáros– Lanzone–Sonnino (doi:10.1007/s10623-011-9562-5), “Singer 8-arcs of Mathon type in PG(2, 27)” by De Clerck–De Winter–Maes (doi:10.1007/s10623-011-9502-4) and “42arcs in PG(2, q) left invariant by P SL(2, 7)” by Indaco–Korchmáros (doi:10.1007/ s10623-011-9532-y) deal with arcs and address questions related to their construction, maximality and classification up to projective equivalence. Polar spaces are the subject of the papers “Two forms related to the symplectic dual polar space in odd characteristic” by Cardinali–Pasini (doi:10.1007/s10623-011-9545-6) and “Collineations of polar spaces with restricted displacements” by Temmermans–Thas– Van Maldeghem (doi:10.1007/s10623-011-9509-x). In particular the description of these spaces in terms of forms and properties of their collineations are considered.	authentication;graph theory;incidence matrix;key distribution;linear algebra;public-key cryptography;secret sharing;symplectic integrator;turing completeness	Arrigo Bonisoli;James W.

Firstly, we construct graph-instances on which “weak PPSZ” has savings of at most (2 + ǫ)/k; the saving of an algorithm on an input formula with n variables is the largest γ such that the algorithm succeeds (i.e. finds a satisfying assignment) with probability at least 2. Since PPSZ (both weak and strong) is known to have savings of at least π +o(1) 6k , this is optimal up to the constant factor. In particular, for k = 3, our upper bound is 2, which is fairly close to the lower bound 2 of Hertli [SIAM J. Comput.’14]. We also construct instances based on linear systems over F2 for which strong PPSZ has savings of at most O (	algorithm;conjunctive normal form;linear system	Pavel Pudlák;Dominik Scheder;Navid Talebanfard	2017		10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2017.85	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	46.153681115505954	37.547442362361245	120674

For such groups specified by generating permutations the authors show that testing membership, computing order and testing isomorphism are NC/sup 1/-equivalent to (and therefore have essentially the same parallel complexity as) determining solvability of a system of linear equations modulo a product of small prime powers; they show that intersecting two such groups is NC/sup 1/-equivalent to computing setwise stabilizers; they show that each of these problems is NC/sup 1/-reducible to the problem of computing a generator-relator presentation. Then the authors prove that the aforementioned problems belong to NC/sup 3/, thus identifying several natural set recognition problems in NC which may lie outside NC/sup 2/. Finally they prove that NC/sup 4/ contains the problem of computing the cyclic decomposition of an Abelian permutation group. Background results include an NC/sup 1/ solution to the problem of computing the product of n integers modulo a (log n)-bit integer, and an NC/sup 1/ reduction from the problem of computing a path between two nodes in a graph to that of determining accessibility of one node from another.

Based on this cons truction, we give two classes of linear codes C̃ f and C f (see Theorem 1 and Theorem 6) over F2t from a Boolean functionf : Fq → F2, whereq= 2n andF2t is some subfield ofFq. The complete weight enumerator of C̃ f can be easily determined from the Walsh spectrum of f , while the weight distribution of the code C f can also be easily settled. Particularly, the number of nonz ero weights ofC̃ f andC f is the same as the number of distinct Walsh values of f . As applications of this construction, we show several series of linear codes over F2t with two or three weights by using bent, semibent, monomial a nd quadratic Boolean functionf .	enumerator polynomial;hadamard transform;linear code;monomial	Can Xiang;Keqin Feng;Chunming Tang	2017	IEEE Trans.

In particular, we study the freeness problem: given a finite set of matrices G generating a multiplicative semigroup S, decide whether each element of S has at most one factorization over G. In other words, is G a code? We show that the problem of deciding whether a matrix semigroup in SL(2,Z) is non-free is NP-hard. Then, we study questions about the number of factorizations of matrices in the matrix semigroup such as the finite freeness problem, the recurrent matrix problem, the unique factorizability problem, etc. Finally, we show that some factorization problems could be even harder in SL(2,Z), for example we show that to decide whether every prime matrix has at most k factorizations is PSPACE-hard.	sl (complexity)	Sang-Ki Ko;Igor Potapov	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-51963-0_21	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algebra	Robotics	39.9524334784297	34.65431635080659	121566

The set of all overlap-free words was studied e. g. by E. D. Fife [8] who described all binary overlapfree infinite words and P. Ś eébold [13] who proved that the Thue-Morse word is essentially the only binary overlap-free word which is a fixed point of a morphism. Nowadays the theory of overlap-free words is a part of a more general theory of pattern avoidance [5]. J.-P. Allouche and J. Shallit [2] asked if the initial Thue’s construction of an overlap-free word could be generalized and found a whole family of overlap-free infinite words built by a similar principle. This paper contains a further generalization of that result; its main theorem was conjectured by J. Shallit [14]. Let us give all the necessary definitions and state the main theorem.

We present an algorithm for a family of plane curves whose degrees in X and Y are low with respect to the curve genus, and suitably unbalanced. The finite base fields are arbitrary, but their sizes should not grow too fast compared to the genus. For this family, the group structure can be computed in subexponential time of Lqg (1/3, O(1)), and a discrete logarithm computation takes subexponential time of Lqg (1/3 + ε, o(1)) for any positive ε.

Given a box-spline, we first analyze its polynomial structure and find its space group which is composed of a point group and a translational group on the domain lattice. To evaluate a spline generated by the box-spline (or its derivative) function, the point group is decomposed into right cosets such that all the polytopes in the same coset share the same analytic polynomial formula. Moreover, by leveraging their symmetries, sufficient number of linearly independent derivative functions of the same order are chosen such that they have a change-of-variables relation with each other. Our OpenCL implementations show that our method is at least ≈ 30% faster but the kernel is at least ≈ 30% smaller compared with the other techniques.	box spline;graphics processing unit;opencl api;polynomial;spline (mathematics);thinking outside the box	Minho Kim	2017	Graphical Models	10.1016/j.gmod.2017.08.001	kernel (linear algebra);discrete mathematics;symmetry group;coset;homogeneous space;box spline;polynomial;group theory;mathematics;spline (mathematics)	Crypto	48.371626826252474	34.21939875577588	123239

(résolution de systèmes multi-homogènes et déterminantiels : algorithmes, complexité, applications)		Multivariate polynomial systems arising in Engineering Science often carry algebraic structures related to the problems they stem from. In particular, multi-homogeneous, determinantal structures and boolean systems can be met in a wide range of applications. A classical method to solve polynomial systems is to compute a Gröbner basis of the ideal associated to the system. This thesis provides new tools for solving such structured systems in the context of Gröbner basis algorithms. On the one hand, these tools bring forth new bounds on the complexity of the computation of Gröbner bases of several families of structured systems (bilinear systems, determinantal systems, critical point systems, boolean systems). In particular, it allows the identification of families of systems for which the complexity of the computation is polynomial in the number of solutions. On the other hand, this thesis provides new algorithms which take profit of these algebraic structures for improving the efficiency of the Gröbner basis computation and of the whole solving process (multi-homogeneous systems, boolean systems). These results are illustrated by applications in cryptology (cryptanalysis of MinRank), in optimization and in effective real geometry (critical point systems).	algebraic equation;algorithm;bilinear filtering;computation;computational complexity theory;critical point (network science);cryptanalysis;cryptography;gröbner basis;linear algebra;mathematical optimization;polynomial	Pierre-Jean Spaenlehauer	2012				Logic	48.2327848569461	36.62198978508032	123326

They also reduce the computation of all common roots to a problem in linear algebra. We propose a determinantal formula for the sparse resultant of an arbitrary system of n + 1 polynomials in n variables. This resultant generalizes the classical one and has significantly lower degree for polynomials that are sparse in the sense that their mixed volume is lower than their Bézout number. Our algorithm uses a mixed polyhedral subdivision of the Minkowski sum of the Newton polytopes in order to construct a Newton matrix. Its determinant is a nonzero multiple of the sparse resultant and the latter equals the GCD of at most n + 1 such determinants. This construction implies a restricted version of an effective sparse Nullstellensatz. For an arbitrary specialization of the coefficients, there are two methods that use one extra variable and yield the sparse resultant. This is the first algorithm to handle the general case with complexity polynomial in the resultant degree and simply exponential in n. We conjecture its extension to producing an exact rational expression for the sparse resultant.	algorithm;coefficient;computation;hilbert's nullstellensatz;linear algebra;minkowski addition;newton;partial template specialization;polyhedron;resultant;sparse matrix;subdivision surface;system of polynomial equations;time complexity	John F.

The number of MBFs in n variables is known as the nth Dedekind number. It is a longstanding computational challenge to determine these numbers exactly – these values are only known for n at most 8. Two monotone Boolean functions are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by permuting the variables. The number of inequivalent MBFs in n variables was known only for up to n = 6. In this paper we propose a strategy to count inequivalent MBFs by breaking the calculation into parts based on the profiles of these functions. As a result we are able to compute the number of inequivalent MBFs in 7 variables. The number obtained is 490013148.	algorithm;boolean algebra;computation;computational resource;lookup table;parallel computing;preprocessor;turing completeness;monotone	Tamon Stephen;Timothy Yusun	2014	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2013.11.015	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;boolean network;boolean domain;boolean expression;mathematics;algebra	Theory	42.784259243762556	38.88434975213798	124038

We clarify the relationship between MUC and the classifying of the truth value assignment. Next, we clarify the clauses correlation and orthogonal by using the two inner product of clauses. Because HornMUC has higher orthogonal, its orthogonal MUC is polynomial size. Because MUC has higher correlation, its orthogonal MUC is not polynomial size. And, HornMUC whereas only be a large polynomial is at most its size even if orthogonal than orthogonal high, MUC will be fit to size polynomial in the size and orthogonalized using HornCNF more highly correlated shown. So DP = P , and N P = P. 1. CNF's classification and CNFSAT We show the relationship between CNFSAT and CNF's classification. We show the relationship between MUC decision problem and CNFSAT. And We show the relationship that determined by the CNF. And We show the relationship between CNF's classification and MUC dicition problem.	boolean satisfiability problem;computation;computational complexity theory;conjunctive normal form;decision problem;karp's 21 np-complete problems;message understanding conference;p-complete;polynomial	Koji Kobayashi	2011	CoRR		discrete mathematics;dot product;computer science;decision problem;mathematics;computational complexity theory;algorithm	AI	39.90837165698354	40.31156987279988	124462

IfM is a matrix overR admitting a LU decomposition, it could happen that the entries of the fa ctorsL andU do not lie inR, but just inK. Having a good control on the valuations of these entries is ve ry important for algorithmic applications. In the paper, we prove that in average these valuations are not t oo large and explain how one can apply this result to provide an efficient algorithm computing a basis of a coherent sheaf over A1K from the knowledge of its stalks.	algorithm;coherence (physics);digital video recorder;lu decomposition;value (ethics)	Xavier Caruso	2012	CoRR			Theory	41.28793629413005	35.42515831269153	124686

It shows that Specht’s approach to the ordinary irreducible representations, along Specht polynomials, can be unified with Clausen’s approach to the modular irreducible representations using symmetrized standard bideterminants. The unified method, using symmetrized Specht polynomials is very easy to explain, and it follows directly from Clausen’s theorem by replacing the indeterminate xij of the letter place algebra by xj. Our approach is implemented in SYMMETRICA. It was used in order to obtain computational results on code theoretic properties of the p-modular irreducible representation[λ]p corresponding to ap-regular partitionλ via embedding it into representation spaces obtained from ordinary irreducible representations. The first embedding is into the permutation representation induced from the column group of a standard Young tableau of shape λ. The second embedding is the embedding of [λ]p into the space of [λ], thep-modular representation obtained from the ordinary irreducible representation [λ] by reducing the coefficients modulo p. We include a few tables with dimensions and minimum distances of these codes, others can be found via our home page.	code;coefficient;home page;indeterminacy in concurrent computation;irreducibility;method of analytic tableaux;modulo operation;polynomial;table (database);theory	Adalbert Kerber;Axel Kohnert	2004	Eur.

This lemma played a central role in the resolution of Serre’s conjecture. In case A contains a set E of cardinality greater than deg v1 + 1 such that y− y′ is invertible for each y 6= y′ in E, we prove that the γi can simply correspond to the elementary operations L1 → L1 + yi ∑n−1 j=2 uj+1Lj , 1 ≤ i ≤ ` = deg v1 + 1, where u1v1 + · · · + unvn = 1. These efficient elementary operations enable us to give new and simple algorithms for reducing unimodular rows with entries in K[X1, . . . , Xk] to t(1, 0, . . . , 0) using elementary operations in case K is an infinite field. Another feature of this paper is that it shows that the concrete local-global principles can produce competitive complexity bounds.	algorithm;elementary;existential quantification;monic polynomial;unimodular polynomial matrix	Henri Lombardi;Ihsen Yengui	2005	J.

Since the classical model has bad reduction, a renormalization of the parameters is required, that can be justified using the theory of algebraic theta functions. The formulas that are obtained are very efficient and may be useful in cryptographic applications. We also show that applying the same strategy to elliptic curves gives Montgomery-like formulas in odd characteristic that are faster than the classical ones, and we recover already known formulas by Stam in characteristic 2.	cantor;computation;cryptography;discrete logarithm;genus (mathematics);linear algebra;montgomery modular multiplication;quartic function	Pierrick Gaudry;David Lubicz	2009	Finite Fields and Their Applications	10.1016/j.ffa.2008.12.006	mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;kummer's function;mathematics;kummer theory;elliptic curve;theta function;algebra	Crypto	44.85677732593771	39.23932758831443	125223
bd0bac72ff69ca37c9205b6792b21be13043c863	first look: linear algebra-based triangle counting without matrix multiplication		Linear algebra-based approaches to exact triangle counting often require sparse matrix multiplication as a primitive operation. Non-linear algebra approaches to the same problem often assume that the adjacency matrix of the graph is not available. In this paper, we show that both approaches can be unified into a single approach that separates the data format from the algorithm design. By not casting the triangle counting algorithm into matrix multiplication, a different algorithm that counts each triangle exactly once can be identified. In addition, by choosing the appropriate sparse matrix format, we show that the same algorithm is equivalent to the compact-forward algorithm attained assuming that the adjacency matrix of the graph is not available. We show that our approach yields an initial implementation that is between 69 and more than 2000 times faster than the reference implementation. We also show that the initial implementation can be easily parallelized on shared memory systems.	adjacency matrix;algorithm design;forward algorithm;linear algebra;matrix multiplication;parallel programming model;reference implementation;shared memory;sparse matrix	Tze Meng Low;Varun Nagaraj Rao;Matthew Lee;Doru-Thom Popovici;Franz Franchetti;Scott McMillan	2017	2017 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)	10.1109/HPEC.2017.8091046	adjacency matrix;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;sparse matrix;hollow matrix;block matrix;diagonal matrix;single-entry matrix;matrix analysis;cuthill–mckee algorithm;mathematics	HPC	48.440078357285316	40.47641055304748	125299

0f392314c0d7ea08b447eaa98a8ce361388a5556	orthogonal arrays		Definition Orthogonal arrays (OAs) are objects that are most often generated via algebraic arguments. They have a number of applications in applied mathematics, and have often been studied by algebraic mathematicians as objects of interest in their own right. Our treatment will reflect their use as representations of statistical experimental designs. An OA is generally presented as a two-dimensional array, table, or matrix of N rows and k columns. Each entry in the array is one element of a set of s “symbols”, often taken to be {0, 1, 2, ..., s− 1} or {1, 2, 3, ..., s}. From the standpoint of basic definitions, the symbols are not regarded as numerical quantities, so {a, b, c, ...} could work just as well. However, the use of numerals (especially the first set above) is convenient for some construction techniques. The final basic quantity required for defining the array it its strength, a positive integer t ≤ k. The single requirement that an N -by-k array of s symbols must meet to be an OA of strength t is that every subset of t columns (from among the k columns), when considered alone, must contain each of the possible s ordered rows the same number of times. A standard notation often used to reference an OA of N rows, k columns, and s symbols, of strength t is OA(N, k, s, t). For example, the following array is an OA(9, 4, 3, 2):	array data structure;column (database);definition;design of experiments;linear algebra;numerical analysis;statistical model	C. R.

This is the problem of mapping decomposition, of which the usual function-decomposition problem [8] is a special case. It was believed that this problem is intractable in general. Some public key cryptosystems (PKC) are based on the difficulty of this mathematical problem. Two types of such PKCs are FAPKC, proposed by Tao [16], and the ``2R -schemes,'' proposed by Patarin and Goubin [11], [12]. FAPKC is based on composing finite automata (FA), while the ``2R -schemes'' use {quadratic functions} as the components. In this paper the decomposition problem for FA and for quadratic functions is investigated. Several methods for FA decomposing and one for quadratic functions are discovered. It is demonstrated that FA composition often exposes essential information about the components and that the full expression of composition of quadratic functions should not be given in 2R -schemes.	automata theory;cryptosystem;finite-state machine;linear algebra;pkc (conference);public-key cryptography;quadratic function	Dingfeng Ye;Zongduo Dai;Kwok-Yan Lam	2001	Journal of Cryptology	10.1007/s00145-001-0001-z	functional decomposition;composition;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;quadratic function;computer science;mathematics;finite-state machine;decomposition;algebraic expression;computer security;algorithm;algebra	Crypto	42.77138514813608	42.327155249338254	126203

If unknown bits of discrete logarithm are continuous then 1-dimensional algorithms for ECDLP may be used. One of these algorithms is improved Gaudry-Schost using equivalence classes which requires (O(1.47sqrt{n}) ) operations. It will be showed that if unknown bits are not continuous and are given in (cu003e1) partitions and also two most significant bits are known, transformation of this partitions into one partition to use 1-dimensional algorithm without increasing size of the problem is impossible. It is also showed that in some situations it is better to “forget” some of known bits to transform the problem to 1-dimensional ECDLP.	elliptic curve cryptography	Michal Wronski;Tomasz Kijko	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-76620-1_3	discrete mathematics;equivalence class;one-dimensional space;elliptic curve;partition (number theory);mathematics;discrete logarithm	DB	44.92988561146558	40.996479823257616	126313

Also, we show that a divisibility problem involving an unbounded number of sparse polynomials is NP-complete using a theorem of Linnik concerning the distribution of primes in arithmetic sequences. From these results it follows that certain problems involving inequalities, recurrence relations, differential equations, and eigenvalues of sparse matrices are NP-hard.

The Lagrange inversion formula is one of the fundamental results of enumerative combinatorics. It expresses the coefficients of powers of the compositional inverse of a power series in terms of the coefficients of powers of the original power series. G. Labelle [10] extended Lagrange inversion to cycle index series, which are equivalent to symmetric functions. Although motivated by Joyal's theory of species of structures [7], Labelle's proof was algebraic, and was based on the ordinary multivariable Lagrange inversion formula. We give here a new proof of this formula in the context of the theory of species. In contrast with the proof given in [10], the bijections involved are all natural in the categorical sense of the word. Our approach involves several new or little-known operations on species, some of which were studied earlier by Joyal [9], and which have other enumerative applications.	coefficient;euler–lagrange equation;lagrange multiplier;linear algebra	Ira M.

The combiner model, which is another possible way of using Boolean functions, requires the same properties as the filter model does, plus one extra criterion the Boolean function must fulfil: high order resiliency. No construction of functions is known which ensures all criteria for the combiner model, even if resiliency is taken in a weakened form, while such constructions are known for the filter model. But nonlinear functions used in this model must be in the particular form $$x_n+f(x_1,\dots ,x_{n-1})$$xn+f(x1,?,xn-1) to allow resistance to the distinguishing attacks for any choice of the tapping sequence. Much work has been done to construct and study Boolean functions allowing resistance to the main known attacks (the Berlekamp---Massey and ROnjom---Helleseth attacks, fast correlation attacks, algebraic attacks and fast algebraic attacks) on stream ciphers using the filter model. None of the found functions has the desired form above. Of course, we can take a function in $$n-1$$n-1 variables and add the extra variable $$x_n$$xn in order to obtain the desired form, but the algebraic immunity of the resulting function can be either equal to that of the original function $$f$$f (and it cannot then be optimal if $$n$$n is odd) or larger by 1. An increasement by 1 considerably impacts the complexity of algebraic attacks. Moreover, taking the best known constructions of functions and adapting them to the desired form result on functions which no longer ensure the best possible algebraic degree. This represents a gap in the research for Boolean functions usable in the filter model. In this paper we study the behavior of the cryptographic characteristics of a function when it is modified into the desired form and we study constructions of functions ensuring an optimal or almost-optimal tradeoff between all the necessary features in this form.	pseudorandomness;random number generation	Claude Carlet;Deng Tang	2015	Des.

0c6c68b36cd3ff6bf13ccff57818d566735bb678	a fast randomized geometric algorithm for computing riemann-roch spaces		We propose a probabilistic Las Vegas variant of Brill-Noether’s algorithm for computing a basis of the Riemann-Roch space L(D) associated to a divisor D on a projective plane curve C over a sufficiently large perfect field k. Our main result shows that this algorithm requires at most O(max(deg(C), deg(D+) ω)) arithmetic operations in k, where ω is a feasible exponent for matrix multiplication and D+ is the smallest effective divisor such that D+ ≥ D. This improves the best known upper bounds on the complexity of computing Riemann-Roch spaces. Our algorithm may fail, but we show that provided that a few mild assumptions are satisfied, the failure probability is bounded by O(max(deg(C), deg(D+) )/|E|), where E is a finite subset of k in which we pick elements uniformly at random. We provide a freely available C++/NTL implementation of the proposed algorithm and we present experimental data. In particular, our implementation enjoys a speed-up larger than 9 on several examples compared to the reference implementation in the Magma computer algebra system. As a by-product, our algorithm also yields a method for computing the group law on the Jacobian of a smooth plane curve of genus g within O(gω) operations in k, which slightly improves in this context the best known complexity O(g) of Khuri-Makdisi’s algorithm.

In this paper, we shall be concerned with symmetric series, that is, when the complex coefficients {c k } −∞ +∞ satisfyc −k=c k,k=0, 1,.... Making use of Brezinski's approach [1], for Padé-type approximation to a formal power series, rational approximants toF(z) with prescribed poles are obtained, and their algebraic properties considered. These results will allow us to give an alternative approach for the Padé-Chebyshev approximants.	approximation;chebyshev polynomials;coefficient;linear algebra;rational set	M.

The G-bentness and G-perfect nonlinearity of functions on X are studied by Poinsot and co-authors (Discret Appl Math 157:1848–1857, 2009; GESTS Int Trans Comput Sci Eng 12:1–14, 2005) via Fourier transforms of functions on G. In this paper we introduce the so-called G-dual set ̂X of X , which plays the role similar to the dual group ̂ G of G, and develop a Fourier analysis on X , a generalization of the Fourier analysis on the group G. Then we characterize the bentness and perfect nonlinearity of functions on X by their own Fourier transforms on ̂X . Furthermore, we prove that the bentness of a function on X can be determined by its distance from the set of G-linear functions. As direct consequences, many known results in Logachev et al. (Discret Math Appl 7:547–564, 1997), Carlet and Ding (J Complex 20:205–244, 2004), Poinsot (2009), Poinsot et al. (2005) and some new results about bent functions on G are obtained.

[Ka2]). While there is a rapidly growing literature concerning this connection, there as yet has been no explanation for it. This note contains an observation providing at least some kind of explanation. It also contains a seemingly useless method for “embedding” translation planes associated with the flocks “into” the generalized quadrangle. Just as in [BLT] we will only be able to deal with the case of odd parameters. It is not the purpose of this note to introduce all of the notation required. Instead, we refer to [Ka2; Ka3; Pal; Pa2; Th]. Let F= GF(q) and Q = F2 x Fx F2, with multiplication in Q given by (u, c, u)(u’, c’, 0’) = (U + u’, c + c’ + v . u’, v + v’), where v . U’ denotes the dot product. The construction in [Ka3; Pal; Pa21 of generalized quadrangles with parameters s=q2, t = q, assumes that 2 x 2 matrices B, and M, = B, + B:, Y E F, are given, and the construction uses the following family 9 of q + 1 subgroups ofQ:	flocking (behavior);pal;quadrangle (geography)	William M.

In this paper, we study various properties of symmetric tensors in relation to a decomposition into a symmetric sum of outer product of vectors. A rank-1 order-k tensor is the outer product of k non-zero vectors. Any symmetric tensor can be decomposed into a linear combination of rank-1 tensors, each of them being symmetric or not. The rank of a symmetric tensor is the minimal number of rank-1 tensors that is necessary to reconstruct it. The symmetric rank is obtained when the constituting rank-1 tensors are imposed to be themselves symmetric. It is shown that rank and symmetric rank are equal in a number of cases, and that they always exist in an algebraically closed field. We will discuss the notion of the generic symmetric rank, which, due to the work of Alexander and Hirschowitz, is now known for any values of dimension and order. We will also show that the set of symmetric tensors of symmetric rank at most r is not closed, unless r = 1.	outer product	Pierre Comon;Gene H. Golub;Lek-Heng Lim;Bernard Mourrain	2008	SIAM J.

Concerning bivariate polynomials, we present a new algorithm for the recombination stage that requires a lifting up to precision twice the total degree of the polynomial to be factored. Its cost is dominated by the computation of reduced echelon solution bases of linear systems. We show that our bound on precision is asymptotically optimal. Introduction Let F denote a polynomial in two variables x and y over a commutative field K. All along this text F represents the polynomial we want to factor over K. Many algorithms for factoring F proceed via so-called lifting and recombination schemes. Such schemes divide into three main stages. Informally speaking, in the first stage one of the two variables is specialized to a random value and the univariate polynomial obtained this way is factored. In the second stage, this factorization is lifted over a power series algebra and in the last stage the factorization over K is discovered from recombinations of the lifted factors. This article is devoted to the third stage only: we show that fast recombination is possible with lifting up to precision only twice the total degree d of F . Recently, using the logarithmic derivative method introduced in [1], it has been proved that lifting up to a precision d(d − 1) + 1 is sufficient to efficiently recover the factors of F by means of linear algebra, whatever the characteristic of the base field is. This bound on precision is optimal for small positive characteristics [1, Remark 5.5]. If K has characteristic 0 or sufficiently large, a linear bound is sufficient, as first shown in [2]. On the other hand, in [12, 13], Ruppert introduced the idea of characterizing the absolute reducibility of F in terms of the existence of closed differential 1-forms ω = HF dx + G F dy, where G and H are in K[x, y] and satisfy some constraints on their degrees. From this characterization, Gao derived an algorithm for computing both the absolute and rational factorizations of F [5]. The core of his algorithm relies on efficiently solving the linear system built from the condition of ω being Received by the editor May 10, 2004 and, in revised form, February 28, 2005. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

The functions with nonlinearity 241 have been identified by a heuristic search in the class of Rotation Symmetric Boolean Functions (RSBFs). In this paper we efficiently perform the exhaustive search to enumerate the 9-variable RSBFs having nonlinearity > 240 and found that there are such functions with nonlinearity 241 only and there is no RSBF having nonlinearity > 241. Our search enumerates 8×189 many 9-variable RSBFs having nonlinearity 241. We further show that there are only two functions which are different up to the affine equivalence. Towards the end we explain the coding theoretic significance of these functions.	brute-force search;enumerated type;heuristic;nonlinear system;theory;turing completeness	Selçuk Kavut;Subhamoy Maitra;Sumanta Sarkar;Melek Diker Yücel	2006	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/11941378_19	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;heuristic;nonlinear system;computer science;mathematics;boolean function;algorithm	Crypto	42.23029737954391	42.91659573607368	131043

This means that the main difficulty in proving the polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture consists in studying sets whose energy is greater than that implied by their doubling. One example is a generalized arithmetic progression of high dimension which cannot occur in finite characteristic.	additive model;berman–hartmanis conjecture;color gradient;period-doubling bifurcation;polynomial;utility functions on indivisible goods	Nets Hawk Katz;Paul Koester	2010	SIAM J.

However, practical methods for producing such drawings ubiquitously use iterative numerical approximations rather than constructing and then solving algebraic expressions representing their exact solutions. To explain this phenomenon, we use Galois theory to show that many variants of these problems have solutions that cannot be expressed by nested radicals or nested roots of low-degree polynomials. Hence, such solutions cannot be computed exactly even in extended computational models that include such operations.	approximation;circle packing theorem;computation;computational model;force-directed graph drawing;image scaling;iterative method;linear algebra;multidimensional scaling;numerical analysis;polynomial;set packing;sum of radicals	Michael J.

4ebeefcd4fae02909631c8f748a3d6b86bfd5b59	asymptotic approximation for the quotient complexities of atoms		In a series of papers, Brzozowski together with Tamm, Davies, and Szyku la studied the quotient complexities of atoms of regular languages [6, 7, 3, 4]. The authors obtained precise bounds in terms of binomial sums for the most complex situations in the following five cases: (G): general, (R): right ideals, (L): left ideals, (T ): two-sided ideals and (S): suffix-free languages. In each case let κC(n) be the maximal complexity of an atom of a regular language L, where L has complexity n ≥ 2 and belongs to the class C ∈ {G,R,L, T ,S}. It is known that κT (n) ≤ κL(n) = κR(n) ≤ κG(n) < 3 and κS(n) = κL(n − 1). We show that the ratio κC(n) κC(n−1) tends exponentially fast to 3 in all five cases but it remains different from 3. This behaviour was suggested by experimental results of Brzozowski and Tamm; and the result for G was shown independently by Luke Schaeffer and the first author soon after the paper of Brzozowski and Tamm appeared in 2012. However, proofs for the asymptotic behavior of κG(n) κG(n−1) were never published; and the results here are valid for all five classes above. Moreover, there is an interesting oscillation for all C: for almost all n we have κC(n) κC(n−1) > 3 if and only if κC(n+1) κC(n) < 3.	approximation;atom;linear algebra;list of code lyoko characters;maximal set;regular language	Volker Diekert;Tobias Walter	2015	Acta Cybern.	10.14232/actacyb.22.2.2015.7	discrete mathematics;combinatorics;mathematics;mathematical analysis;atom;quotient;asymptotic analysis	Theory	40.94729527987373	36.49896921905283	131407
abcac4c8f215b3184fc9055f91f0fc1be12cb4d7	some formulae for partitions into squares	partitions;squares	We consider the problem of determining the number of partitions of a number into a fixed number of squares. This problem is distinct from, but not unrelated to, the corresponding classical problem of determining the number of representations of a number as the sum of a fixed number of squares. Whereas the classical problem has received an enormous amount of attention over the years, see Dickson [3, Vol. II, Chapters VI–IX], it appears that this (restricted) partition problem has not previously been investigated. Hardy and Ramanujan [4, p.305] and Baxter [1] have looked at the problem of partitions of a number into (an unrestricted number of) squares, which finds application in statistical mechanics. To see why one might want to examine the partition problem, consider the following. Jacobi’s four square theorem states that the number of representations of n > 1 as the sum of four squares is given by	baxter (robot);jacobi method;partition problem	Michael D.

173b5f5b8690debe47d1e78d8fefd94f61b79821	two structural results for low degree polynomials and applications	004;low degree polynomials affine extractors affine dispersers extractors for varieties dispersers for varieties	In this paper, two structural results concerning low degree polynomials over finite fields are given. The first states that over any finite field F, for any polynomial f on n variables with degree d ≤ log(n)/10, there exists a subspace of F with dimension Ω(d·n1/(d−1)) on which f is constant. This result is shown to be tight. Stated differently, a degree d polynomial cannot compute an affine disperser for dimension smaller than Ω(d ·n1/(d−1)). Using a recursive argument, we obtain our second structural result, showing that any degree d polynomial f induces a partition of F to affine subspaces of dimension Ω(n1/(d−1)!), such that f is constant on each part. We extend both structural results to more than one polynomial. We further prove an analog of the first structural result to sparse polynomials (with no restriction on the degree) and to functions that are close to low degree polynomials. We also consider the algorithmic aspect of the two structural results. Our structural results have various applications, two of which are: Dvir [11] introduced the notion of extractors for varieties, and gave explicit constructions of such extractors over large fields. We show that over any finite field any affine extractor is also an extractor for varieties with related parameters. Our reduction also holds for dispersers, and we conclude that Shaltiel’s affine disperser [26] is a disperser for varieties over F2. Ben-Sasson and Kopparty [6] proved that any degree 3 affine disperser over a prime field is also an affine extractor with related parameters. Using our structural results, and based on the work of Kaufman and Lovett [19] and Haramaty and Shpilka [17], we generalize this result to any constant degree. 1998 ACM Subject Classification F.1.0 Computation by Abstract Devices – General	computation;polynomial ring;randomness extractor;recursion;sparse matrix	Gil Cohen;Avishay Tal	2013	Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity (ECCC)	10.4230/LIPIcs.APPROX-RANDOM.2015.680	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;affine hull;mathematics;algorithm;algebra	Theory	41.50197575357738	40.52031344000992	131634

In this paper we provide several examples of trace −2, including an explicit infinite family. We establish that the minimal degree for a Salem numb er of trace−2 is 20, and exhibit all Salem numbers of degree 20 and trace −2. Indeed there are just two examples. We also settle the closely-related question of the minimal d egreed of a totally positive algebraic integer such that its trace is ≤ 2d −2. This minimal degree is 10, and there are exactly three conjugate sets of degree 10 an d trace 18. Their minimal polynomials enable us to prove that all except five co njugate sets of totally positive algebraic integers have absolute trace gr eater than 16 /9. We end with a speculative section where we prove that, if a sin gle polynomial with certain properties exists, then the trace problem for t otally positive algebraic integers can be solved.	digital footprint;linear algebra;polynomial;salem;speculative execution	James McKee;Chris Smyth	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-24847-7_25	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;minimal polynomial;algebra	Theory	41.800833689814624	36.150947923514195	131654

More recently, connections to the theory of cryptographic communications have emerged. Combinatorial designs have provided solutions to problems coming from signal processing, radar, error-correcting codes, optical orthogonal codes, and image processing. Further, the most elegant solutions have come from designs with prescribed automorphisms. In this paper, we focus on partial geometric designs, a generalization of the classical 2-design. These designs have recently been shown to produce two directed strongly regular graphs. We generalize the well-known Kramer---Mesner Theorem for 2-designs to partial geometric designs. We also construct infinite families of partial geometric designs admitting a group of automorphisms which acts regularly on the point set and semi-regularly on the block set. The designs are obtained from new constructions of partial geometric difference families. These families were recently introduced a generalization of both the classical difference family and the partial geometric difference set.		Kathleen Nowak;Oktay Olmez	2016	Des.

For natural numbers 1 <= i, j <= 3, C , denotes llhe 3x3 matrix over Z 2 with l ' s on the i th row ~nd l ' s on the jth column, and 0's elsewhere.

Then we give some combinatorial formulas involving the hðxÞ-Fibonacci and hðxÞ-Lucas polynomials. Moreover we obtain the convolved hðxÞ-Fibo-nacci polynomials from a family of Hessenberg matrices. Fibonacci numbers and their generalizations have many interesting properties and applications to almost every fields of science and art (e.g., see [1]). The Fibonacci numbers F n are the terms of the sequence 0; 1; 1; 2; 3; 5;. . ., wherein each term is the sum of the two previous terms, beginning with the values F 0 ¼ 0 and F 1 ¼ 1. Besides the usual Fibonacci numbers many kinds of generalizations of these numbers have been presented in the literature. In particular, a generalization is the k-Fibonacci Numbers. In [2], k-Fibonacci numbers were found by studying the recursive application of two geometrical transformations used in the four-triangle longest-edge (4TLE) partition. These numbers have been studied in several papers; see [2–7].	chebyshev polynomials;convolution;fibonacci polynomials;karl hessenberg;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;polynomial;recursion	José L.

We consider the Bloch-Kato conjecture applied to the symmetric square L-function of an elliptic curve over Q, at s = 2. In particular, we use a construction of elements of order l in a generalised Shafarevich-Tate group, which works when E has a rational point of infinite order and a rational point of order l. The existence of the latter places us in a situation where the recent theorem of Diamond, Flach, and Guo does not apply, but we find that the numerical evidence is quite convincing.

It plays also a role in coding theory, since it is related to the covering radii of Reed-Muller codes. We introduce a method for lower-bounding its values and we deduce bounds on the second-order nonlinearity for several classes of cryptographic Boolean functions, including the Welch and the multiplicative inverse functions (used in the S-boxes of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)). In the case of this last infinite class of functions, we are able to bound the whole profile, and we do it in an efficient way when the number of variables is not too small. This allows showing the good behavior of this function with respect to this criterion as well.	block cipher;coding theory;cryptanalysis;cryptography;encryption;hamming distance;nonlinear system;recursion (computer science);reed–muller code;s-box;welch's method;window function	Claude Carlet	2006	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2007.915704	arithmetic;reed–muller code;block cipher;combinatorics;boolean expression;mathematics;boolean function;algorithm;statistics	Theory	42.10002951297012	44.05012164348429	136731

This approach leads to easy proofs for some known and new properties of algebraic normal and Walsh transforms. Several new results about algebraic and correlation properties that depend on the weight transform of Boolean functions are proved. Finally, we present a new probabilistic characteristic of a Boolean function that is defined by its algebraic normal and probabilistic transforms over the reals.	a-normal form;algebraic equation;algorithm;approximation;coefficient;fast fourier transform;hadamard transform;linear algebra;polynomial	Alexander Kholosha;Henk C.

The kernel is available in form of a software library module programmed in C++ extending LEDA. We introduce the basic data types like points, vectors, directions, hyperplanes, segments, rays, lines, spheres, affine transformations, and operations connecting these types. The description consists of a motivation for the basic class layout as well as topics like layered software design, runtime correctness via checking routines and documentation issues. Finally we shortly describe the usage of the kernel in the application domain.	computational geometry	Kurt Mehlhorn;Michael Müller;Stefan Näher;Stefan Schirra;Michael Seel;Christian Uhrig;Joachim Ziegler	1996	Comput.

In this paper, Jacobi forms are obtained by substituting theta series into the complete m-spotty weight enumerators of binary Type II codes. The Mellin transforms of those theta series provide functional equations for partial Epstein zeta functions which are summands of classical Epstein zeta functions associated with quadratic forms. Then, it is observed that the coefficientmatrices appearing in those functional equations are exactly the same as the transformation matrices in the MacWilliams identity for the complete mspotty weight enumerators of binary self-dual codes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Let H ( g ) be the maximum of the absolute value of the coefficients of g . For 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, let [ƒ] p denote the p th Bombieri norm of ƒ. This norm is a weighted ℓ p norm of the coefficient vector of ƒ, the weights being certain negative powers of the binomial coefficients. We determine explicit constants D ( p ) such that H ( g ) H ( h ) ≤ D ( p ) n [ƒ] p which implies that min( H ( g ), H ( h )) ≤ D ( p ) n/2 [ƒ] 1/2 p . The constants D ( p ) are proved to be best possible for infinitely many values of p including p = 1,2 and ∞. If ƒ, g and h have real coefficients, and if ƒ2(x) = (-1) n ƒ( x )ƒ(- x ) , we give explicit constants E ( p ) so that H ( g ) H ( h ) ≤ E ( p ) n [ƒ2] 1/2 p . For p = ∞, this gives an easily computed estimate which is better than the classical inequality H ( g ) H ( h ) ≤ 2 n M (ƒ), where M (ƒ) denotes Mahler's measure of ƒ, a quantity which is more difficult to compute.	polynomial	David W.

An MV family is called $q$-restricted if inner products $\langle u_i,v_j\rangle$ take at most $q$ different values. Our interest in MV families stems from their recent application in the construction of subexponential locally decodable codes (LDCs). There, $q$-restricted MV families are used to construct LDCs with $q$ queries, and there is special interest in the regime where $q$ is constant. When $m$ is a prime it is known that such constructions yield codes with exponential block length. However, for composite $m$ the behavior is dramatically different.

By exploring the periodic property of the binomial coefficients modulo $m$, two new lower bounds on the $MOD_{m}$-degree of the $MOD_{l}$ and $\neg MOD_{m}$ functions are proved, where $m$ is any composite integer and $l$ has a prime factor not dividing $m$. Both bounds improve from sublinear to $\Omega(n)$. With the periodic property, a simple proof of a lower bound on the $MOD_{m}$-degree with symmetric multilinear polynomial of the OR function is given. It is also proved that the majority function has a lower bound $n \over 2$ and the {MidBit} function has a lower bound $\sqrt{n}$.	polynomial ring	Shi-Chun Tsai	1996	SIAM J.

We prove that computation of immanants is VNP-complete if the immanants are attached to a family of diagrams whose separation is Ω(n δ) for some δ > 0. We define the separation of a diagram to be the largest number of overhanging boxes contained in a single row. Our theorem proves a conjecture of Bürgisser for a large variety of families, and in particular we recover with new proofs his VNP-completeness results for hooks and rectangles.	complete (complexity);computation;diagram;linear algebra;polynomial	Jean-Luc Brylinski;Ranee Brylinski	2003	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;automated theorem proving;symmetric group;computational complexity theory;algorithm	Theory	39.36527296508563	34.6444530501227	138374

The zero sets of $$v^T Av$$vTAv and $$v^T Bv$$vTBv, for $$v \in GF(q)^3$$v?GF(q)3 and $$v\ne 0$$v?0, can be viewed as (possibly degenerate) conics in $$PG(2,q)$$PG(2,q), the Desarguesian plane of order $$q$$q. Using combinatorial properties of pencils of conics in $$PG(2,q)$$PG(2,q), we are able to tell when it is possible to find a regular matrix $$S$$S with entries in $$GF(q)$$GF(q), such that $$S^T A S$$STAS and $$S^T BS$$STBS are both diagonal matrices. This is equivalent to the existence of a collineation, which maps two given conics into two conics in diagonal form. For two proper conics, we will in particular compare the situation in $$PG(2,q)$$PG(2,q) to the real projective plane and compare the geometrical properties of being diagonalizable with our combinatorial results.

e99aed617b14f37d53a6a1654d107b2dd58d3203	minimum length key in mst cryptosystems		As a special factorization category of finite groups, logarithmic signature (LS) is used as the main component of cryptographic keys that operate within secret key cryptosystems such as PGM and public key cryptosystems like MST 1, MST 2 and MST 3. An LS with the shortest length is called a minimal logarithmic signature (MLS) that constitutes of the smallest sized blocks and offers the lowest complexity, and is therefore desirable for cryptographic constructions. However, the existence of MLSs for finite groups should be firstly taken into an account. The MLS conjecture states that every finite simple group has an MLS. If it holds, then by the consequence of Jordan-Hölder Theorem, every finite group would have an MLS. In fact, many cryptographers and mathematicians are keen for solving this problem. Some effective work has already been done in search of MLSs for finite groups. Recently, we have made some progress towards searching a minimal length key for MST cryptosystems and presented a theoretical proof of MLS conjecture. 根据有限单群的分类定理,本文利用有限群论、代数群论、射影几何等学科的相关理论给出了剩余四种单群极小对数签名的结构,最终从理论上完成MLS 猜想的证明,为MST 密码系统提供了广阔的应用平台。具体成果如下: (a) 给出了一类经典单群极小对数签名的构造。(b) 给出了一类经典单群—射影特殊酉群极小对数签名的构造。 (c) 构造了所有十类特殊李型群的极小对数签名。 (d) 构造了剩余十三类零散群的极小对数签名。	computational group theory;cryptosystem;encryption;key (cryptography);key size;linear algebra;list of cryptographers;public-key cryptography	Haibo Hong;Licheng Wang;Haseeb Ahmad;Yixian Yang;Zhiguo Qu	2015	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-015-5479-3	discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Crypto	40.21672997732275	38.80097337353109	140571

Abstract: These seminar notes represent the proceedings of a seminar devoted to the analysis of algorithms and related topics. The subjects covered include combi-natorics, symbolic computation, asymptotic analysis, and average-case analysis of algorithms and data structures. Abstract : In the first part of this paper, we define approximate polynomial gcds (greatest common divisors) and extended gcds provided that approximations to the zeros of the input polynomials are available. We relate our novel definition to the older and weaker ones, based on perturbation of the coefficients of the input polyno-mials, we demonstrate some deficiency of the ]latter definitions (which our definition avoids), and we propose new effective sequential and parallel (RNC and NC) algorithms for computing approximate gcds and extended gcds. Our stronger results are obtained with no increase of the asymptotic bounds on the computational cost. This is partly due to application of our recent nearly optimal algorithms for approximating polynomial zeros. In the second part of our paper, working under the older and more customary definition of approximate gcds, we modify and develop an alternative approach, which was previously based on the computation of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the associated Sylvester (resultant) matrix. We observe that only a small part of the SVD computation is needed in our case, and we also yield further simplification by using the techniques of Pad4 approximation and computations with Hankel and Bezout matrices. Finally, in the last part of our paper, we show an extension of the numerical computation of the gcd to the problem of computing numerical rank of a Hankel matrix, which is a bottleneck of Pads and Berlekamp-Massey computations, having important applications to coding and transmission of information.

41c94218f423ef24745eaa21fd1f19ccd82d3e0c	scalable and sound low-rank tensor learning		A tensor A can be unfolded into a matrix A in various ways. We focus here on 2-way unfoldings that specify a proper partition of {1, . . . ,K} := [K] = {m1, . . . ,mp} ∪ {n1, . . . , nq}, an integer-valued row index function r, and a column index function c, such that Ai1,...,iK 7→ Ar(im1 ,...,imp ), c(in1 ,...,inq ). This is simply a rearrangement of the entries in A hence preserves its Frobenius norm. We use the notation A(r,c) for the 2-way unfolding under the index functions r and c. The above tensor unfolding interacts conveniently with the mode-k multiplication, once we define a suitable matrix Kronecker product. Fix two row index functions r and r̂. The Kronecker product of p matrices U ∈ Rd̂m1×dm1 , . . . ,W ∈ Rd̂mp×dmp is a matrix that has size ∏p k=1 d̂mk × ∏p k=1 dmk and satisfies (U · · · W )ı̂,i = Uı̂m1 ,im1 · · ·Wı̂mp ,imp , (16)	interface message processor;matrix multiplication;symmetric multiprocessing;unfolding (dsp implementation)	Hao Cheng;Yaoliang Yu;Xinhua Zhang;Eric P.

5aaa91108bc8201388f234b35b5a8637596a2369	a method for solving key equation for decoding goppa codes		In this paper we show that the key equation for decoding Goppa codes can be solved using Euclid's algorithm. The division for computing the greatest common divisor of the Goppa polynomial  g ( z ) of degree 2 t  and the syndrome polynomial is stopped when the degree of the remainder polynomial is less than or equal to  t  − 1. The error locator polynomial is proved the multiplier polynomial for the syndrome polynomial multiplied by an appropriate scalar factor. The error evaluator polynomial is proved the remainder polynomial multiplied by an appropriate scalar factor. We will show that the Euclid's algorithm can be modified to eliminate multiplicative inversion, and we will evaluate the complexity of the inversionless algorithm by the number of memories and the number of multiplications of elements in  GF ( q m  ). The complexity of the method for solving the key equation for decoding Goppa codes is a few times as much as that of the Berlekamp—Massey algorithm for BCH codes modified by Burton. However the method is straightforward and can be applied for solving the key equation for any Goppa polynomial.	goppa code	Yasuo Sugiyama;Masao Kasahara;Shigeichi Hirasawa;Toshihiko Namekawa	1975	Information and Control	10.1016/S0019-9958(75)90090-X	synthetic division;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;polynomial function theorems for zeros;homogeneous polynomial;alternating polynomial;stable polynomial;wilkinson's polynomial;degree of a polynomial;primitive polynomial;mathematics;polynomial long division;goppa code;monic polynomial;matrix polynomial;characteristic polynomial;reciprocal polynomial;polynomial remainder theorem;square-free polynomial;algorithm;polynomial;algebra	Crypto	46.6199548067168	40.167849831745194	141512

b9c1c6bb1d7828b4f47f2ee3330dab26adb946dc	an existence theory for pairwise balanced designs i. composition theorems and morphisms		One of the most central problems of modern combinatorial theory is the determination of those parameter triples (v, k, X) for which there exist (0, k, h)-BIBD’s (balanced incomplete block designs). The methods which have been put forth to construct BIBD’s divide roughly into two classes: direct constructions where a BIBD is obtained from an algebraic structure (often a design is constructed from its automorphism group), and recursive or composition methods where a BIBD is built up by purely combinatorial means from another design or an assortment of “smaller” designs (see [6]). It is the second class with which we deal here. One of the first instances of a composition theorem was presented by E. H. Moore [l l] in 1893 in connection with Steiner triple systems, i.e., (0, 3, I)-BIBD’s. Several methods were expounded by Bose and Shrikhande [l] and composition techniques were instrumental in their remarkable work (with E. T. Parker) on orthogonal Latin squares [2, 31. Significant contributions have been made by H. Hanani [7, 8, lo] in his work on BIBD’s with k = 3,4, 5 and composition methods are used by Ray-Chaudhuri and Wilson [12] in connection with Kirkman designs. An attempt is made here to unify some of these various constructions and to present them in a more general, common setting. The general theorems presented here will be illustrated by examples and will be applied in the second part of this article, “An Existence Theory for Pairwise Balanced Designs, II. The Structure of PBD-Closed Sets and the Existence Conjectures” [15], to a conjecture on the existence of BIBD’s [6, p. 2381. For simplicity of exposition, we consider only designs with X = 1.

Yuzvinsky’s Conjecture on intercalate matrices claims that the smallest n for which there is an intercalate matrix of type [r, s, n] is the Hopf-Stiefel function r◦s. In this paper we prove Yuzvinsky’s Conjecture is asymptotically true for 56 of integer pairs (r, s). We prove the conjecture for r 6 8, and we study it in the range r, s 6 32.

Recent work in 1 has given the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of normal bases of GF ( 2 n ) with a prescribed trace vector when n is odd or n is a power of two. However, the methods in 1 cannot work in general cases. In this paper, using methods different from 1, we give a complete characterization of the trace self-orthogonal relations of arbitrary normal bases. Furthermore, we provide a combination method to construct normal elements with the prescribed trace vectors. These generalize the results in 1 to general cases. The main result of this paper is shown as follows.Let a ? = ( a 0 , a 1 , ? , a n - 1 ) be a prescribed n-vector over GF ( q ) , with corresponding polynomial f a ( x ) = ? i = 0 n - 1 a i x i . We present that there exists a normal element α of GF ( q n ) over GF ( q ) , with trace vector a ? , such that a i = Tr q n | q ( α 1 + q i ) for all 0 ? i ? n - 1 , if and only if a i = a n - i for all 1 ? i ? n - 1 and1)when q is odd, f a ( x ) is prime to x n - 1 ; f a ( 1 ) is a quadratic residue in GF ( q ) ; for even n, if f a ( - 1 ) ? 0 , then f a ( - 1 ) is not a quadratic residue in GF ( q ) ;2)when q is even, f a ( x ) is prime to x n - 1 ; for even n, a n / 2 = 0 and if 4 | n , then Tr q | 2 ( ? i = 0 n / 4 - 1 a 0 - 1 a 2 i + 1 ) = 1 .

This problem has been extended to three or more variables; for this generalization, all fast algorithms proposed so far rely on the lattice approach. In this paper, we reduce this multivariate interpolation problem to a problem of simultaneous polynomial approximations, which we solve using fast structured linear algebra. This improves the best known complexity bounds for the interpolation step of the list-decoding of Reed-Solomon codes, Parvaresh-Vardy codes, and folded Reed-Solomon codes. In particular, for Reed-Solomon list-decoding with re-encoding, our approach has complexity O~(ℓω-1m2(n - k)), where ℓ, m, n, and k are the list size, the multiplicity, the number of sample points, and the dimension of the code, and ω is the exponent of linear algebra; this accelerates the previously fastest known algorithm by a factor of ℓ/m.	algorithm;approximation theory;bivariate data;fastest;folded reed–solomon code;linear algebra;list decoding;multivariate interpolation;polynomial;reed–solomon error correction;time complexity	Muhammad F.

The methods of elimination theory and undetermined coefficients also reveal that the implicit equation can be written with coefficients from the coefficient field of the parametric polynomials. All three techniques can be implemented as implicitization algorithms. For each method, the theoretical limitations of the proof and the practical advantages and disadvantages of the algorithm are discussed. Our results are important for two reasons. First, we caution that elimination theory cannot be generalized in a straightforward manner from rational plane curves to rational surfaces to show the existence of the implicit equation; thus other rigorous methods are necessary to bypass the vanishing of the resultant in the presence of base points. Second, as an immediate consequence of the coefficient relationship, we see that the implicit representation involves only rational (or real) coefficients if a parametric representation involves only rational (or real) coefficients. The existence of the implicit equation means every rational surface is a subset of an irreducible algebraic surface. The subset relation can be proper and this may cause problems in certain applications in computer aided geometric design. This anomaly is illustrated by an example.	coefficient	Eng-Wee Chionh;Ron Goldman	1994	CVGIP: Graphical Model and Image Processing	10.1006/cgip.1994.1003	rational function;discrete mathematics;computational geometry;mathematics;geometry;algorithm	ML	51.48902960933099	32.37154886250468	145731

After recalling some group-theoretical properties, we focus on the decomposition algorithm enabling to represent any periodic sequence taking values in a cyclic group as a sum of a reducible and a reproducible sequence. The implementation of this decomposition theorem in a computer aided music composition language, as OpenMusic [1] , enables to easily verify if a given periodic sequence is reducible or reproducible. In this special case, one of the two terms will be identically zero. This means that every periodic sequence has in itself a certain degree of reducibility and reproducibility. We also suggest how to use this result in order to explain some regularities of the distribution of numerical values in the case of the finite addition process and how to generalize the decomposition theorem by means of the Fitting Lemma. This opens the problem of the musical relevance of a generalized module-theoretical approach in Vieru’s theory of periodic sequences.	algorithm;constant function;curve fitting;finite difference;numerical analysis;openmusic;relevance	Moreno Andreatta;Dan Tudor Vuza;Carlos Agón	2004	Soft Comput.	10.1007/s00500-004-0382-7	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;cyclic group;periodic sequence;mathematics;decomposition	Theory	48.00818818262016	35.47883402217633	145812

The first one eliminates one variable from a finite set of polynomials with complex or real coefficients and it is based on a parametric version of Barnett’s Method for computing the greatest common divisor of a finite family of univariate polynomials. The second one, based on Hermite’s Method, deals with the global elimination of a block of variables from a finite set of multivariate polynomials with a particular structure (containing a Pham system). A common feature of both procedures is that the final step relies on a specific property of a real-valued inner product on vector spaces over the coefficient field: Gram’s Criterion. c © 1999 Academic Press	coefficient;linear algebra;polynomial	Laureano González-Vega;Neila Gonzalez-Campos	1999	J.

As applications, we consider (i) a new RSA cryptanalysis for multiple short secret exponents, (ii) its partial key exposure situation, and (iii) investigating the hardness of finding a certain amount of LSBs of the RSA secret exponent. More precisely, our algorithm can factor an RSA modulus from l ≥ 2 pairs of RSA public exponents with the common modulus corresponding to secret exponents smaller than N (9l−5)/(12l+4), which improves on the previously best known result N (3l−1)/(4l+4) by Sarkar and Maitra [41, 42]. For partial key exposure situation, we also can factor the modulus if β − δ/2 + 1/4 < (3l − 1)(3l + 1), where β and δ are bit-lengths /n of the secret exponent and its exposed LSBs, respectively. Particularly, letting β = 1, which means that the secret exponent is full-sized, the necessary amount of exposed bits is [5/2− 2(3l− 1)/(3l+ 1)]n, which is less than n for l ≥ 3. Suppose we have an algorithm that recovers the above amount of d from e and N satisfying e ≈ N . We showed that N can be factored in polynomial time in logN under a heuristic assumption that the Coppersmith technique works. When l becomes large, the necessary amount becomes 0.5n bits. Hence, we conclude that recovering the lower half of LSBs of d is polynomial time equivalent to the factoring under the heuristic assumption. From the last result, we propose a half-amount conjecture that roughly, factoring RSA modulus is polynomial-time equivalent to any continued bits of secret information such as p, q, d, p + q and p − q (or dp and dq for RSA-CRT). It is supported from several results, e.g., Coppersmith [12] shows that recovering the upper half of p is equivalent to factoring.	algorithm;cathode ray tube;cryptanalysis;heuristic;integer factorization;minkowski addition;modulus of continuity;polynomial;polynomial-time reduction;rsa (cryptosystem);time complexity	Yoshinori Aono	2012	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		minkowski addition;discrete mathematics;combinatorics;modular design;lattice (order);mathematics	Crypto	44.79717294619464	40.70331117073755	146754

By for now, in the addition of conic curves over Zn, all points on the curves are expressed by the form of (x,y) as the determinant condition. Then, the points belonging to C1,C2,Cn,O are computed and the results are discussed respectively. As a consequence too much cost is spent during the calculation. In mobile environment, more attention is paid to cut down the signature execution cost. How to make the signature more efficient is thus more important. The paper reconsiders the addition operation on conic curves over ring Zn as to reduce the amount of calculation. In the progress of the proposed addition operation, the value of (x, y) doesn’t need to be computed and all points could be expressed by parameter t. As a result, the computational cost is reduced.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;cryptography	Guo-jing Li;Tao Wen	2009	2009 Fifth International Conference on Information Assurance and Security	10.1109/IAS.2009.240	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;mathematics;geometry	Robotics	43.672984546680524	43.76941951569025	147248

Bounds on the dimension of the auxiliary system needed to optimally distinguish quantum operations are known in several situations. For instance, the dimension of the auxiliary space never needs to exceed the dimension of the input space [Smi83, Kit97] of the operations for optimal distinguishability, while no auxiliary system whatsoever is needed to optimally distinguish unitary operations [AKN98, CPR00]. Another bound, which follows from work of R. Timoney [Tim03], is that optimal distinguishability is always possible when the dimension of the auxiliary system is twice the number of operators needed to express the difference between the quantum operations in Kraus form. This paper provides an alternate proof of this fact that is based on concepts and tools that are familiar to quantum information theorists.	quantum decoherence;quantum entanglement;quantum information;quantum operation	John Watrous	2008	Quantum Information & Computation		quantum operation;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;quantum information;quantum discord;quantum capacity;pure mathematics;mathematics;quantum channel;quantum computer;decoherence-free subspaces;quantum process;quantum algorithm;physics;quantum mechanics;quantum phase estimation algorithm;quantum error correction	Theory	42.09772067825318	33.72520980767362	147563

We also present new connections between two of these measures.

f357a02f28be64396dec029b3dd127550b05d9b6	algebraic complexity in finite fields		Functions mapping a vector of elements of a finite field to another vector of elements of the same field are studied by using the concept of straightline algorithms and the corresponding algebraic complexity that counts additions and multiplications in the field. If the operations are in GF(2), then this complexity measure is essentially the Boolean circuit complex¬ ity. A central role in these considerations is played by binary representa¬ tions of finite fields, which are introduced and their algebraic complex¬ ity studied. A method of surrogate computation is introduced to prove several relations that give insight into binary representations. Several applications of these results are given. The circuit complexity of Zech's logarithm is shown to be closely related to the circuit complexity of the discrete logarithm problem applied in public-key cryptography. For any finite field with characteristic p such that p — 1 has only small prime factors, it is proved that algebraic complexity in this field is essentially equivalent to circuit complexity. Further, an efficient new algorithm to factor a polynomial over a finite field is presented that exploits a binary representation of the field; the algorithm is shown to be of practical value, e.g., in decoders for Reed-Solomon codes. New algorithms to evaluate polynomials are proposed. They exploit the fact that the coefficients of the polynomials are in a finite field. With respect to the number of operations (additions and multiplica¬ tions), these algorithms outperform all previously known algorithms for many interesting cases. These algorithms for evaluating polynomials are used to upperbound the algebraic complexity of functions. Tight bounds on the maximum complexity of functions are obtained, even when the function table is only partially defined. The most difficult functions are also studied with respect to multiplicative and additive complexity, i.e., the minimum number of multiplications and additions,		Jürg Ganz	1994			algebraic element;singular point of an algebraic variety;algebraic closure;field;dimension of an algebraic variety;real algebraic geometry;algebraic surface;algebraic extension;function field of an algebraic variety;algebraic function;differential algebraic geometry;algebraic cycle;algebraic geometry and analytic geometry	Theory	43.7227218402461	40.79734759684595	149103

Płonka sums with sup-semilattices as arities were originally defined as operations on algebras of regular theories.

Their arities are the categories of the regular polynomials over any sup-semilattice, i.e. any algebra for the terminal semi-analytic monad. We also show that similar operations can be defined on the category of algebras of any analytic monad. This time we can allow the arities to be the categories of linear polynomials over any commutative monoid, i.e. any algebra for the terminal analytic monad.

Given a polynomial in Fpm [x] of degree d over the finite field Fpm , one can view it as a map from Fpm to Fpm , and examine the image of this map, also known as the value set. In this paper, we present the first non-trivial algorithm and the first complexity result on explicitly computing the cardinality of this value set. We show an elementary connection between this cardinality and the number of points on a family of varieties in affine space. We then apply Lauder and Wan’s p-adic point-counting algorithm to count these points, resulting in a non-trivial algorithm for calculating the cardinality of the value set. The running time of our algorithm is (pmd)O(d). In particular, this is a polynomial-time algorithm for fixed d if p is reasonably small. We also show that the problem is #P-hard when the polynomial is given in a sparse representation, p = 2, and m is allowed to vary, or when the polynomial is given as a straight-line program, m = 1 and p is allowed to vary. Additionally, we prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether a polynomial represented by a straight-line program has a root in a prime-order finite field, thus resolving an open problem proposed by Kaltofen and Koiran in [5, 6].	algorithm;np-hardness;p (complexity);polynomial;sharp-p-complete;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;time complexity	Qi Cheng;Joshua E.

They have to solve a linear system with modular polynomial entries that requires another (modular) Gröbner basis computation. After an extension of luckiness to arbitrary (commutative noetherian) base rings we show in this paper that for a homogeneous polynomial ideal I one can lift not only its Gröbner basis but also a homogeneous basis of its syzygy module. The same result holds for arbitrary ideals and liftings from Z/p to Q. Moreover the same lifting can be obtained from a true Gröbner trace by linear algebra over Q only. Parallel modular techniques allow to find such a true Gröbner trace and a lucky prime with high probability. All these results generalize in an obvious way to homogeneous modules generated by the rows of matrices with polynomial entries. Since luckiness can be weakened to a condition that transfers from I to higher syzygy modules the lifting theorem generalizes to a lifting theorem for the resolution of I.	algorithm;computation;gröbner basis;lambda lifting;lifting scheme;linear algebra;linear system;polynomial;with high probability	Hans-Gert Gräbe	1993	J.

We first characterize all linear bijective maps on n(F) (n ≥ 4) preserving rank 2 when F is any field, and thereby the characterization of all linear bijective maps on n(F) preserving the max-rank is done when F is any field except for {0,1}. Furthermore, the linear preservers of the determinant (resp., adjoint) on n(F) are also characterized by reducing them to the linear preservers of the max-rank when n is even and F is any field except for {0,1}.

These monic polynomials can be defined recursively as 1(x) = x − 1 and ∏i |n i(x) = xn − 1 for n > 1. The first few are easily calculated to be x − 1, x + 1, x2 + x + 1, x2 + 1, . . . . For these and other basic facts, see an algebra text such as [5]. While it might appear that the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomials are always ±1, the presence of 2x7 in 105(x) shows that this is not invariably the case (and indeed is a good counterexample for those students who insist that the “law of small numbers” is universally valid; see [4] for further discussion). Naturally, much work has been done on the values of the coefficients of n(x). One amazing fact worthy of mention is that every integer appears as a coefficient in some cyclotomic polynomial (see [1], [8]).

Moreover, using a suitable grading for the algebra P compatible with the action of @S, we obtain a bijective correspondence, preserving Grobner bases, between graded @S-invariant ideals of P and a class of graded two-sided ideals of S. By means of the embedding @i this results in the unification, in the graded case, of the Grobner bases theories for commutative and non-commutative polynomial rings. Finally, since the ring of ordinary difference polynomials P=K[XxN] fits the proposed theory one obtains that, with respect to a suitable grading, the Grobner bases of finitely generated graded ordinary difference ideals can be computed also in the operators ring S and in a finite number of steps up to some fixed degree.	gröbner basis;polynomial ring	Roberto La Scala;Viktor Levandovskyy	2013	J.

We overcome this by considering real numbers equipped with additional structure, which we call a locator. With this structure, it is possible, for instance, to construct a signed-digit representation or a Cauchy sequence. Such constructions are reminiscent of computable analysis. However, instead of working with a notion of computability, we simply work constructively to extract observational information, by considering a certain locatedness structure on real numbers.	computability;computable analysis;computable function;observable;online locator service	Auke Bart Booij	2018	CoRR		cauchy distribution;discrete mathematics;computable analysis;dedekind cut;real number;constructive analysis;decimal representation;cauchy sequence;mathematics;integer	Logic	40.21660340754067	39.13832624321452	153538

The new operator computes the intersection of projection factor sets produced by different CAD projection orders. In other words, it computes the gcd of projection polynomials in the same variables produced by different CAD projection orders. We prove that the new operator still guarantees obtaining at least one sample point from every connected component of the highest dimension, and therefore, can be used for testing semi-definiteness of polynomials. Although the complexity of the new method is still doubly exponential, in many cases, the new operator does produce smaller projection factor sets and fewer open cells. Some examples of testing semi-definiteness of polynomials, which are difficult to be solved by existing tools, have been worked out efficiently by our program based on the new method.	computation;computer-aided design;connected component (graph theory);linear algebra;polynomial;regular semi-algebraic system;semiconductor industry;time complexity	Jingjun Han;Liyun Dai;Bican Xia	2014		10.1145/2608628.2608676	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;projection;projection;dykstra's projection algorithm;mathematics;projection;polynomial;algebra	Theory	48.61862685497264	39.5673460345389	153686

We give upper and lower bounds on the maximum magnitude (absolute value) of the coefficients required to represent such functions. These bounds are very close. In the linear case in particular they are almost matching. This quantity is the same as the maximum magnitude of integer coefficients of linear equations required to express every possible intersection of a hyperplane in R and the Boolean cube {0, 1}n, or in the general case intersections of hypersurfaces of degree d in R and the Boolean cube {0, 1}n. In the process we construct new families of ill-conditioned matrices. We further stratify the problem (in the linear case) in terms of the dimension k of the affine subspace spanned by the solutions, and give upper and lower bounds in this case as well. Our bounds here in terms of k leave a substantial gap, a challenge for future work.	boolean algebra;coefficient;condition number;dimension function;linear equation;polynomial;time complexity	László Babai;Kristoffer Arnsfelt Hansen;Vladimir V.

This mathematical tool can be helpful for the classification of non-linear functions f : F m p → F n p based on their cryptographic properties. It thus can have relevance in the design criteria for substitution boxes (S-boxes), the latter being commonly used to achieve non-linearity in most symmetric key algorithms. First, we introduce a simple but effective representation of the cryptographic properties of S-box functions when the characteristic of the underlying finite field is odd; following this line, we adapt the linear cryptanalysis technique, providing a generalization of Matsui’s lemma. This is done in order to complete the proof of Theorem 2 in [7], also by considering the broader class of generalized affine transformations. We believe that the present work can be a step towards the extension of known cryptanalytic techniques and concepts to finite fields with odd characteristic.	cryptography;linear cryptanalysis;linear function;nonlinear system;relevance;s-box;scientific literature;symmetric-key algorithm;turing completeness	Marco Macchetti;Mario Caironi;Luca Breveglieri;Alessandra Cherubini	2005		10.1007/11560586_27	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;boolean function;algorithm;statistics	Crypto	42.98411295427974	42.16757482425836	154870

In spite of the apparent difference of the algorithms of these two classes, their strong equivalence is demonstrated. (ii) Then we accelerate parallel division of two polynomials with integer coefficients of degrees at most m by a factor of log m comparing with the parallel version of the algorithm of Sieveking and Kung. The result relies on the analysis of the recent algorithm of D. Bini adjusted to the division of polynomials over integers. (Some known parallel algorithms attain the same parallel time but use zrn times more processors.) (iii) Finally the authors’ new algorithm improves the estimates for sequential time complexity of division with a remainder of two integer polynomials by a factor of log m, m being the degree of the dividend. Under the parallel model, it attains Boolean logarithmic time, which is asymptotically optimum. The algorithm exploits the reduction of the problem to integer division; the polynomial remainder and quotient are recovered from integer remainder and quotient via binary segmentation. (iv) The latter approach is also extended to the sequential evaluation of the gcd of two polynomials over integers.	central processing unit;coefficient;computational complexity theory;parallel algorithm;polynomial long division;polynomial remainder theorem;time complexity;toeplitz hash algorithm;turing completeness	Dario Bini;Victor Y.

In this talk, we study a quantum analogue of the Dixmier conjecture. More precisely, we exhibit quantum analogues of A1(C) that we obtain as primitive quotients of the positive part U q (so5) of the quantized enveloping algebra Uq(so5). It appears that some of these quotients belong to the family of (quantum) generalized Weyl algebras (GWA for short) introduced by Bavula about twenty years ago. In this talk, I will give a full classification of endomorphisms of quantum GWAs over a Laurent polynomial ring. In the case where these algebras are simple, our classification shows that every endomorphism is an automorphism. This result applies in particular to certain quantizations of the first Weyl algebra obtained as primitive quotients of U q (so5). This is based on joint work with Andrew Kitchin.	laurent polynomial;polynomial ring;wigner–weyl transform	Stéphane Launois	2015	ACM Comm.

For   c=0     c  =  0        the transform              V    f    c          reduces to the conventional Walsh transform, and hence a 0-bent 4  function is bent. In this article we generalize the concept of partially bent functions to the transforms              V    f    c         . We show that every quadratic function is partially bent, and hence it is plateaued with respect to any of the transforms              V    f    c         . In detail we analyse two quadratic monomials. The first has values as small as possible in its spectra with respect to all transforms              V    f    c         , and the second has a flat spectrum for a large number of  c . Moreover, we show that every quadratic function is  c -bent 4  for at least three distinct  c . In the last part we analyse a cubic monomial. We show that it is  c -bent 4  only for   c=1     c  =  1       , the function is then called negabent, which shows that non-quadratic functions exhibit a different behaviour.	boolean algebra	Nurdagül Anbar;Wilfried Meidl	2017	Finite Fields and Their Applications	10.1016/j.ffa.2017.03.008	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;hadamard transform;quadratic function;bent function;mathematics;boolean function;algebra	Crypto	43.78492728828095	36.11599506609897	155320

First we revisit an algorithm originally described by Brent and Kung for composition of power series, showing that it can be applied practically to composition of polynomials in Z[x] given in the standard monomial basis. We offer a complexity analysis, showing that it is asymptotically fast, avoiding coefficient explosion in Z[x]. Secondly we provide an improvement to Mulders’ polynomial division algorithm. We show that it is particularly efficient compared with the multimodular algorithm. The algorithms are straightforward to implement and available in the open source FLINT C library.

The method of this paper is to lower Wilson’s bound by using Weil’s theorem on character sums to exploit Wilson’s sufficient conditions for the existence of (q,6,1) difference families.

Our system features arrays of 64 electrodes. Each electrode can be addressed through a cross bar switch, to enable it to be used for stimulation or recording. This electrode switch, a bank of low noise amplifiers with an integrated analog to digital converter, power conditioning electronics, and a communications and control gate array are co-located with the electrode array in a 14 millimeter diameter satellite package that is designed to be flush mounted in a skull burr hole. Our system features five satellite packages connected to a central hub processor-controller via ten conductor cables that terminate in a custom designed, miniaturized connector. The connector incorporates features of high reliability, military grade devices and utilizes three distinct seals to isolate the contacts from fluid permeation. The hub system is comprised of a connector header, hermetic electronics package, and rechargeable battery pack, which are mounted on and electrically interconnected by a flexible circuit board. The assembly is over molded with a compliant silicone rubber. The electronics package contains two antennas, a large coil, used for recharging the battery and a high bandwidth antenna that is used to download data and update software. The package is assembled from two machined alumina pieces, a flat base with brazed in, electrical feed through pins and a rectangular cover with rounded corners. Titanium seal rings are brazed onto these two pieces so that they can be sealed by laser welding. A third system antenna is incorporated in the flexible circuit board. It is used to communicate with an externally worn control package, which monitors the health of the system and allows both the user and clinician to control or modify various system function parameters.	aluminum oxide;amplifier;analog;analog-to-digital converter;antenna device component;cable;cpu cache;circuit board device component;coil device component;compliance behavior;conditioning (psychology);connector device component;control theory;controllers;converter device component;diameter (qualifier value);download;electricity;flexible circuit;flushing;gadget (computer science);gate array;header device component;implants;neuron;phocidae;printed circuit board;rechargeable battery;requirement;ring device;seal (emblem);silicone elastomers;silicones;terminate (software);titanium;trephine hole;usb hub;welding occupations;electrode;millimeter	Caroline K.

This also enables us to devise a simple algorithm to factor polynomials with rational coefficients. All algorithms work in polynomial time. Introduction. Manuel Blum raised the following question: Suppose we are given an approximate root of an unknown polynomial with integral coefficients and a bound on the degree and size of the coefficients of the polynomial. Is it possible to infer the polynomial? We answer his question in the affirmative. We show that if a complex number a satisfies an irreducible polynomial h(X) of degree d with integral coefficients in absolute value at most H, then given 0(d? + d ■ logH) bits of the binary expansion of the real and complex parts of a, we can find h(X) in deterministic polynomial time (and then compute in polynomial time any further bits of a). Using the concept of secure pseudorandom sequences formulated by Shamir [23], Blum and Micali [3] and Yao [25], we then show that the binary (or m-ary for any m) expansions of algebraic numbers do not form secure sequences in a certain well-defined sense. We are able to extend our results with the same techniques to transcendental numbers of the form log(a),cos_1(a), etc., where a is algebraic. The technique is based on the lattice basis reduction algorithm from [16]. Our answer to Blum's question enables us to devise a simple polynomial-time algorithm to factor polynomials with rational coefficients: We find an approximate root of the polynomial and use our algorithm to find the irreducible polynomial satisfied by the exact root, which must then be a factor of the given polynomial. This is repeated until all the factors are found. This algorithm was found independently by Schönhage [22], and was already suggested in [16]. The technique of the paper also provides a natural, efficient method to compute with algebraic numbers. This paper is the final journal version of [13], which contains essentially the entire contents of this paper. 1. A Polynomial-Time Algorithm for Blum's Question.

9921d3877c240f2499c27c03283ea781fee989c5	a new algebraic method to search irreducible polynomials using decimal equivalents of polynomials over galois field gf(p^q)		Irreducible polynomials play an important role till now, in construction of 8-bit S-Boxes in ciphers. The 8-bit S-Box of Advanced Encryption Standard is a list of decimal equivalents of Multiplicative Inverses (MI) of all the elemental polynomials of a monic irreducible polynomial over Galois Field GF(2 8 ) [1]. In this paper a new method to search monic Irreducible Polynomials (IPs) over Galois fields GF(p q ) has been introduced. Here the decimal equivalents of each monic elemental polynomial (ep), two at a time, are split into the p-nary coefficients of each term, of those two monic elemental polynomials. From those coefficients the p-nary coefficients of the resultant monic basic polynomials (BP) have been obtained. The decimal equivalents of resultant basic polynomials with p-nary coefficients are treated as decimal equivalents of the monic reducible polynomials, since monic reducible polynomials must have two monic elemental polynomials as its factor. The decimal equivalents of polynomials belonging to the list of reducible polynomials are cancelled leaving behind the monic irreducible polynomials. A non-monic irreducible polynomial is computed by multiplying a monic irreducible polynomial by α where α GF(p) and assumes values from 2 to (p-1).

Since it uses nine numbers to represent three angular degrees of freedom, there are six independent constraints on the matrix elements. Each column(and row) is unit vector, which gives us 3 constraints and the columns (and rows) are orthogonal to each other, yielding another 3 constraints. The translation (∈ R) and rotation together are represented as Special Euclidean group SE(3). The 6 constraints are larger compared to all other parameterizations mentioned below. They are therefore computationally more expensive than them. However, these have the advantage that they have no singularities or ambiguities such as double cover in attitude space in their representation as the rotation matrix is uniquely determined for a given configuration.	angularjs;column (database);constraint (mathematics);isometric projection;the matrix	Hardik Parwana;Mangal Kothari	2017	CoRR		quaternion;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;euler angles;mathematics;parameterized complexity;complex number;computer vision;artificial intelligence	Vision	42.01364639749942	33.91945556236478	157584

Over the past half century numerical analysis has made great strides in the understanding of approximation in matrix computation. But also, roughly over the past three decades, a solid algorithmic basis for exact sparse and dense matrix computation has emerged. We argue that the computer algebra community has the interests, techniques, motivations, and applications to develop high performance computational capabilities for exact linear algebra It is a tale of two equivalence relations, similarity and matrix equivalence. These were characterized in the 19th century via the Jordan canonical form and Smith normal form respectively. Associated with these are the computational concerns of numerical linear algebra, eigenvalues and linear system solving respectively. But applications of exact linear algebra tend to need some or all of the invariants themselves associated with these equivalences. From rank to characteristic polynomial, computation of these invariants resists pure numerical solution and provides an important role for computer algebra.  We discuss the state of the art and current issues in algorithms and software system design for exact linear algebra over the integers, the rational numbers, and over finite fields. We show some of the applications in which large scale exact linear algebra has been used.	algorithm;approximation;characteristic polynomial;computational economics;iterative method;linear system;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;software system;sparse matrix;symbolic computation;systems design;turing completeness	David Saunders	2010	ACM Comm.

This problem arises because it is often desirable to set up a data structure for L before the numerical computation is performed, and in order to do this we must know the positions of the nonzeros of L. We describe a representation$\mathcal {R}_L $ for L which typically requires far fewer data items than the number of nonzeros in L, and an algorithm is then described which generates $\mathcal {R}_L $. The time and space complexity of the algorithm is shown to be $O(|A|,|\mathcal {R}_L |)$, and can never be worse than $O(|L|)$. Here $|\mathcal {R|}_L |$ denotes the number of items in the data structure for L, and $|A|$ (and $|L|$ denote the number of nonzeros in A and L respectively. For a certain class of problems, we show that the execution time of the algorithm is $O(N)$, even though $|L|$ ...	algorithm	Alan George;Joseph W. H. Liu	1980	SIAM J.

Based on this approach, we develop an algorithm for computing the characteristic cycle of the local cohomology modules H I (R) for any ideal I ⊆ R using the Čech complex. The algorithm, in particular, is useful for answering questions regarding vanishing of local cohomology modules and computing Lyubeznik numbers. These applications are illustrated by examples of computations using our implementation of the algorithm in Macaulay 2.	algorithm;computation;macaulay;polynomial ring	Josep Àlvarez Montaner;Anton Leykin	2006	J.

We use this idea to obtain a formula, known as the powersum formula, for the terms of theα-resolvent. Finally, we use the powersum formula to rediscover Cockle’s differential resolvent of a cubic trinomial.	bring radical;cubic function;indeterminacy in concurrent computation;polynomial;resolution (logic);trinomial	John Michael Nahay	2004	Int.

fe81f36405d5a79d626e7cf9f6eb147c72a3d916	fast computation of approximant bases in canonical form		In this article, we design fast algorithms for the computation of approximant bases in shifted Popov normal form. We first recall the algorithm known as PM-Basis, which will be our second fundamental engine after polynomial matrix multiplication: most other fast approximant basis algorithms basically aim at efficiently reducing the input instance to instances for which PMBasis is fast. Such reductions usually involve partial linearization techniques due to Storjohann, which have the effect of balancing the degrees and dimensions in the manipulated matrices. Following these ideas, Zhou and Labahn gave two algorithms which are faster than PM-Basis for important cases including Hermite-Padé approximation, yet only for shifts whose values are concentrated around the minimum or the maximum value. The three mentioned algorithms were designed for balanced orders and compute approximant bases that are generally not normalized. Here, we show how they can be modified to return the shifted Popov basis without impact on their cost bound; besides, we extend Zhou and Labahn’s algorithms to arbitrary orders. Furthermore, we give an algorithm which handles arbitrary shifts with one extra logarithmic factor in the cost bound compared to the above algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this improves upon previously known algorithms for arbitrary shifts, including for particular cases such as Hermite-Padé approximation. This algorithm is based on a recent divide and conquer approach which reduces the general case to the case where information on the output degree is available. As outlined above, we solve the latter case via partial linearizations and PM-Basis.

543e64334757b859241f58b1e9039dc3db146116	quantum spectrum testing	representation theory;property testing;mixed states;schur weyl duality	"""In this work, we study the problem of testing properties of the spectrum of a mixed quantum state. Here one is given n copies of a mixed state ρ∈ C<sup>d x d</sup> and the goal is to distinguish (with high probability) whether ρ's spectrum satisfies some property P or whether it is at least ε-far in l<sub>1</sub>-distance from satisfying P. This problem was promoted under the name of testing unitarily invariant properties of mixed states. It is the natural quantum analogue of the classical problem of testing symmetric properties of probability distributions.  Unlike property testing probability distributions---where one generally hopes for algorithms with sample complexity that is sublinear in the domain size---here the hope is for algorithms with <i>subquadratic</i> copy complexity in the dimension d. This is because the (frequently rediscovered) """"empirical Young diagram (EYD) algorithm"""" [ARS88,KW01,HM02,CM06] can estimate the spectrum of any mixed state up to ε-accuracy using only O(d<sup>2</sup>/ε<sup>2</sup>) copies. In this work, we show that given a mixed state ρ ∈ C<sup>d x d</sup>: Θ(d/ε<sup>2</sup>) copies are necessary and sufficient to test whether ρ is the maximally mixed state, i.e., has spectrum (1/d, ..., 1/d). This can be viewed as the quantum analogue of a result of Paninski [Pan08]. Θ(r<sup>2</sup>/ε) copies are necessary and sufficient to test with one-sided error whether ρ has rank r, i.e., has at most r nonzero eigenvalues. For two-sided error, a lower bound of Ω(r/ε) copies holds. Θ(r<sup>2</sup>) copies are necessary and sufficient to distinguish whether ρ is maximally mixed on an r-dimensional or an (r+1)-dimensional subspace. More generally, for r vs. r+Δ (with 1 ≤ Δ ≤ r), Θ(r<sup>2</sup>/Δ) copies are necessary and sufficient. The EYD algorithm requires Ω(d<sup>2</sup>/ε<sup>2</sup>) copies to estimate the spectrum of ρ up to ε-accuracy, nearly matching the known upper bound. Our techniques involve the asymptotic representation theory of the symmetric group; in particular Kerov's algebra of polynomial functions on Young diagrams."""	diagram;monte carlo algorithm;polynomial;property testing;quantum state;sample complexity;with high probability	Ryan M O'Donnell;John Wright	2015		10.1145/2746539.2746582	combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;representation theory;property testing;schur–weyl duality;mathematics	Theory	41.381979281164625	35.85451455375826	159473
883d000f8ad0166b8d6b757aa0f8f70d7f13ee7c	identification of two classes of planar septic pythagorean hodograph curves		Abstract Polynomial Pythagorean hodograph (PH) curves have a polynomial arc length function and rational offsets, which distinguish PH curves from general polynomial parametric curves. However, these algebraic properties can hardly be used directly for the identification of PH curves. In order to determine whether or not a given septic planar polynomial curve is a PH curve, Zheng et al. (2016) studied a class of septic curves’ geometric properties and proposed an efficient algorithm. In this paper, we further complete their work on Bezier control polygons of septic PH curves. We point out that there are three classes of septic PH curves according to different factorizations of their derivatives. Except the first class which has been studied, geometric characteristics of the other two classes are proposed. By introducing auxiliary points, the results are in terms of angles and lengths of legs of their Bezier control polygons. Moreover, we give feasible methods for the construction of auxiliary points, including various degenerate cases.		Yujun Li;Lincong Fang;Juan Cao;Guozhao Wang	2019	J.

For d q/3 + 2, the three first highest numbers of points of hypersurfaces of degree d in the n-dimensional projective space over the finite field Fq are given only by some hyperplane arrangements. We show that for q/2 + 5/2 d < q, this is no longer the case: the third highest number associated to some hyperplane arrangements can also be obtained in this case by some hypersurface containing an irreducible quadric. For the curves on Fp with p a prime number we show that this condition is the best possible. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In this correspondence a method for representing the groups in a form suitable for machine calculation is shown. An e5cient method for calculating the Fourier transform of a group is also proposed and its relationship to the fast Fourier transform is shown. For groups of characteristic two, the calculation requires only N log2 N additive operations where N is the order of the group. Proof: Any finite Abelian group can be uniquely decomposed into the direct product of cyclic groups of prime power orders (see MacDuffee [5], page 74, or Albert [I], page 22). Any cyclic group of order hi is isomorphic to the group of integers under addition modulo hi. Thus the theorem follows from the definition of direct product. It should also be noted that if N is the order of G then N = hlh2, * . -, hk. Let gi be generators of the cyclic subgroups Gi of order hi.

The function f is realized as a polynomial in each segment, and a lookup table stores the coefficients of the polynomial. Such an algorithm is an essential part of the design of lookup table methods [5,8,9,12,14,15] for realizing numeric functions, such as sin(πx), ln(x), and √ −ln(x). Our algorithm requires many fewer steps than a previous algorithm given in [6] and makes tractable the design of numeric function generators based on table lookup for high-accuracy applications. We show that an estimate of segment width based on local derivatives greatly reduces the search needed to determine the exact segment width. We apply the new algorithm to a suite of 15 numeric functions and show that the estimates are sufficiently accurate to produce a minimum or near-minimum number of computational steps.	algorithm;cobham's thesis;coefficient;computation;lookup table;polynomial	Jon T.

In this paper we revisit both results from the computational perspective. Specifically, we give an algorithm to construct space sextic curves that arise from blowing up P at eight points and provide algorithms to compute the 120 tritangents and their Steiner system of any space sextic. Furthermore, we develop efficient inverses to the aforementioned methods. We present an algorithm to either reconstruct the original eight points in P from a space sextic or certify that this is not possible. Moreover, we extend a construction of Lehavi [Leh15] which recovers a space sextic from its tritangents and Steiner system.

Moreover, we look at their effects geometrically instead of algebraically; this allows us to tackle cases that were not tractable with the classical algebraic approach.

This hybrid method applies to functions that remain of moderate growth near the unit circle and satisfy suitable smoothness assumptions—this, even in the case when the unit circle is a natural boundary. A prime application is to coefficients of several types of infinite product generating functions, for which full asymptotic expansions (involving periodic fluctuations at higher orders) can be derived. Examples relative to permutations, trees, and polynomials over finite fields are treated in this way.	coefficient;computation;exptime;enumerated type;glossary of computer graphics;golomb ruler;newton's method;pc bruno;polynomial;quantum fluctuation;refinement (computing);root of unity;time complexity;turing completeness	Philippe Flajolet;Éric Fusy;Xavier Gourdon;Daniel Panario;Nicolas Pouyanne	2006	Electr.

Our algorithm assumes that an upper bound on the number of erroneous evaluations is given as input, and is a generalization of the algorithm by Lakshman and Saunder [SIAM J. Comput., vol. 24 (1995)] for interpolating sparse Chebyshev polynomials and the techniques in error-correcting sparse interpolation in the usual basis of consecutive powers of the variable due to Comer, Kaltofen, and Pernet [Proc. ISSAC 2012 and 2014]. We prove the correctness of our list-decoder-based algorithm with a Descartes-rule-of-signs-like property for sparse polynomials in Chebyshev basis. We also give a new algorithm that reduces the sparse interpolation in Chebyshev basis to that in power basis, thus making the many techniques for the sparse interpolation in power basis, for instance, supersparse (lacunary) interpolation over large finite fields, available to interpolation in Chebyshev basis. Furthermore, we can customize the randomized early termination algorithms from Kaltofen and Lee [J. Symb.

In particular, the logistic map is used as one of the chaotic map. However, if the logistic map is implemented by using unite precision computer arithmetic, rounding is required. In order to avoid rounding, Miyazaki, Araki, Uehara and Nogami proposed the logistic map over finite fields, and show some properties of sequences generated by the logistic map over finite fields. In this paper, we show some properties of periods of sequences generated by the logistic map over finite fields with control parameter four. In particular, we show conditions for parameters and initial values to have a long period, and asymptotic properties for periods by numerical experiments.	arithmetic logic unit;chaos theory;experiment;logistic map;maximal set;numerical analysis;rounding	Kazuyoshi Tsuchiya;Yasuyuki Nogami	2015	2015 Seventh International Workshop on Signal Design and its Applications in Communications (IWSDA)	10.1109/IWSDA.2015.7458394	tent map;legendre symbol;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;logistic map;mathematics;hyperbola;statistics	Robotics	42.326635642697944	45.77189242658797	164926

We present our further observations on the structure of the AES algorithm relating to the cyclic properties of the functions used in this cipher. We note that the maximal period of the linear layer of the AES algorithm is short, as previously observed by S. Murphy and M.J.B. Robshaw. However, we also note that when the non-linear and the linear layer are combined, the maximal period is dramatically increased not to allow algebraic clues for its cryptanalysis. At the end of this paper we describe the impact of our observations on the security of the AES algorithm. We conclude that although the AES algorithm consists of simple functions, this cipher is much more complicated than might have been expected.	algorithm;cipher;cryptanalysis;linear algebra;maximal set;nonlinear system	Beomsik Song;Jennifer Seberry	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-39887-5_17	discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm;algebra	Crypto	43.510425821078506	41.24197939324725	165263
ca894740a6474abcd387c29fc46a40867b366b64	on the variance of sums of arithmetic functions over primes in short intervals and pair correlation for l-functions in the selberg class		We establish the equivalence of conjectures concerning the pair correlation of zeros of L-functions in the Selberg class and the variances of sums of a related class of arithmetic functions over primes in short intervals. This extends the results of Goldston & Montgomery [6] and Montgomery & Soundararajan [10] for the Riemann zeta-function to other L-functions in the Selberg class. Our approach is based on the statistics of the zeros because the analogue of the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture for the auto-correlation of the arithmetic functions we consider is not available in general. One of our main findings is that the variances of sums of these arithmetic functions over primes in short intervals have a different form when the degree of the associated L-functions is 2 or higher to that which holds when the degree is 1 (e.g. the Riemann zeta-function). Specifically, when the degree is 2 or higher there are two regimes in which the variances take qualitatively different forms, whilst in the degree-1 case there is a single regime.	autocorrelation;degree (graph theory);montgomery modular multiplication;turing completeness;while	H.

33f44482c3c9cb30c0c3cb91d0493695fd6e549f	composition theorems in communication complexity	communication complexity;satisfiability;inner function;quantum communication complexity;quantum physics;computational complexity;lower bound;simple group	A well-studied class of functions in communication complexity are composed functions of the form (f ◦ g)(x, y) = f(g(x, y), . . . , g(x, y)). This is a rich family of functions which encompasses many of the important examples in the literature. It is thus of great interest to understand what properties of f and g affect the communication complexity of (f ◦ g), and in what way. Recently, Sherstov [She09] and independently Shi-Zhu [SZ09b] developed conditions on the inner function g which imply that the quantum communication complexity of f ◦g is at least the approximate polynomial degree of f . We generalize both of these frameworks. We show that the pattern matrix framework of Sherstov works whenever the inner function g is strongly balanced—we say that g : X×Y → {−1,+1} is strongly balanced if all rows and columns in the matrix Mg = [g(x, y)]x,y sum to zero. This result strictly generalizes the pattern matrix framework of Sherstov [She09], which has been a very useful idea in a variety of settings [She08b,RS08,Cha07,LS09a,CA08,BHN09]. Shi-Zhu require that the inner function g has small spectral discrepancy, a somewhat awkward condition to verify. We relax this to the usual notion of discrepancy. We also enhance the framework of composed functions studied so far by considering functions F (x, y) = f(g(x, y)), where the range of g is a group G. When G is Abelian, the analogue of the strongly balanced condition becomes a simple group invariance property of g. We are able to formulate a general lower bound on F whenever g satisfies this property.	approximation algorithm;column (database);communication complexity;degree of a polynomial;discrepancy function;quantum channel;the matrix	Troy Lee;Shengyu Zhang	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14165-2_41	function composition;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;simple group;communication complexity;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;computational complexity theory;quantum mechanics;satisfiability	Theory	40.579867340354596	41.14320654798122	166582

It is shown that the membership problem of such a domain can be solved in P^N^P, i.e., in polynomial time relative to an oracle in NP, in contrast to the higher upper bound P^M^P for domains without the property of polynomial inverse modulus of continuity. On the other hand, the lower bound of UP for the membership problem still holds for domains with polynomial inverse moduli of continuity. It is also shown that the path problem of such a domain can be solved in PSPACE, matching its known lower bound, while no fixed upper bound was known for domains without this property.	polynomial;scott continuity	Ker-I Ko;Fuxiang Yu	2007	Electr.

The transformations included in this framework are called $\Lambda$-transformations and include permutation, skewing and reversal, as well as a transformation called loop scaling. This framework is more general than the existing ones; however, it is also more difficult to generate code in our framework. This paper shows how integer lattice theory can be used to generate efficient code. An added advantage of our framework over existing ones is that there is a simple completion algorithm which, given a partial transformation matrix, produces a full transformation matrix that satisfies all dependences. This completion procedure has applications in parallelization and in the generation of code for NUMA machines.	loop optimization	Wei Li;Keshav Pingali	1992		10.1007/3-540-57502-2_60	loop fusion;computer science;technical report;lattice;satisfiability	Vision	48.24912969836689	40.892671964278655	167557

Sundara Row on the geometry in paper folding published in 1893. After 123 years, the significance of the book remains. This note is intended to provide a short description of Sundara Row’s masterpiece from the viewpoint of the current mathematical theory of origami and show how various geometrical shapes that Sundara Row drew in his book can be produced by a modern tool of computational origami. Furthermore, the tool enables a reader to manipulate, by a simple scripting language, graphics of the produced shapes and the internal algebraic representations, as well as to perform algebraic proofs of the lemmas and theorems that Sundara Row wrote down in his book.	computation;correctness (computer science);eos;graphics;linear algebra;scripting language;viewpoint	Tetsuo Ida	2016	2016 18th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC)	10.1109/SYNASC.2016.017	shape;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;geometry;algorithm;algebra;compass	Theory	50.89134841332574	34.99127880555405	168761

1834ce965d4b1869f2c21fe799a9309eecb2c81a	on the largest affine sub-families of a family of nfsr sequences	families of nfsr sequences;94a55;94a60;journal;nonlinear feedback shift registers;stream ciphers	Recently nonlinear feedback shift registers (NFSRs) have frequently been used as building blocks for designing stream ciphers. Let NFSR (g) be an m-stage NFSR with characteristic function g = x0 ⊕g1(x1, . . . , xm−1)⊕ xm . Up to now there has been no known method to determine whether the family of output sequences of the NFSR (g), denoted by S(g), contains a sub-family of sequences that are exactly the output sequences of an NFSR ( f ) of stage n < m. This paper studies affine cases, that is, finding an affine function f such that S( f ) is a subset of S(g). If S(g) contains an affine sub-family S( f ) whose order n is close to m, then a large number of sequences generated by the NFSR (g) have low linear complexities. First, we give two methods to bound the maximal order of affine sub-families included in S(g). Experimental data indicate that if S(g) contains an affine sub-family of order not smaller than m/2, then the upper bound given in the paper is tight. Second, we propose two algorithms to solve affine sub-families of a given order n included in S(g), both of which aim at affine sub-families with the maximal order. Algorithm 1 is applicable when n is close to m, while the feasibility of Algorithm 2 relies on the distribution of nonlinear terms of g. In particular, if Algorithm 2 works, then its computation complexity is less than that of Algorithm 1 and it is quite efficient for a number of cases.	algorithm;computation;maximal set;national fund for scientific research;nonlinear system;shift register;stream cipher	Tian Tian;Wen-Feng Qi	2014	Des.

42be463a650cfff47f3d5962da5fbe9cd1c78bc8	an algorithm for isolating the real solutions of semi-algebraic systems	computacion informatica;ciencias basicas y experimentales;grupo a	a semi-algebraic system (sas for short), where n, s ≥ 1, r, t, m ≥ 0 and pi, gj , hk are all polynomials in x1, . . . , xs with integer coefficients. Furthermore, we always assume that {p1, . . . , pn} has only a finite number of common zeros. Many problems in both practice and theory can be reduced to problems of solving sas. For example, we may mention some special cases of the “p-3-p” problem (Folke, 1994) which originates from computer vision, the problem of constructing limit cycles for plane differential systems (Ma and Zheng, 1994) and the problem of automated discovering and proving for geometric inequalities (Yang et al., 1999, 2001). Moreover, many problems in geometry, topology and differential dynamical systems are expected to be solved by translating them into certain semi-algebraic systems. There are two classical methods, Tarski’s method (Tarski, 1951) and the cylindrical algebraic decomposition method proposed by Collins (1975), for solving semi-algebraic systems. Counting and isolating real solutions are two key problems in the study of the real solutions of a sas from the viewpoint of symbolic computation. Some effective methods for attacking the first problem are those using trace forms or the rational univariate representation (Pedersen et al., 1993; Gonzalez-Vega et al., 1999) and the algorithm	algebraic equation;algorithm;coefficient;computer vision;dynamical system;limit cycle;linear algebra;polynomial;semiconductor industry;symbolic computation;word lists by frequency;yang	Bican Xia;Lu Yang	2002	J.

We present here an algorithm for the computation of minimal generating sets in the non-modular case. Apart from very few explicit computations of Gröbner bases, the algorithm only involves very basic operations. As a test bed for comparative benchmarks, we use transitive permutation groups on 7 and 8 variables. In most examples, our algorithm implemented in Singular works much faster than the one used in Magma, namely by factors between 50 and 1000. We also compute some further examples on more than 8 variables, including a minimal generating set for the natural action of the cyclic group of order 11 in characteristic 0 and of order up to 15 in small prime characteristic. We also apply our algorithm to the computation of irreducible secondary invariants.	algorithm;computation;gröbner basis;irreducibility;magma;polynomial;pseudorandom permutation;testbed	Simon A.

be13bdcbb6d82aa0de12cdf719e9d3e34a9a8ac4	an extension of \((2, m(m+1)/2)\)-threshold secret sharing schemes		Fast (k, n)-threshold secret sharing schemes with XOR operations have proposed by Kurihara et al. and Fujii et al. independently. Their method are ideal that share size is equal to the size of the data to be distributed with the benefits that can be handled very fast for using the only XOR operations at distribution and reconstruction processes. In these cases for the number of shares n, target data must be equally divided into individual (n_p-1) pieces where (n_p) is a prime more than n. The existing methods described above are configured using the cyclic matrices with prime order. On the other hand, a new method in WAIS2013 has proposed, this leads to general constructions of ((2,p+1))-threshold secret sharing schemes. Moreover, we use m-dimensional vector spaces over (mathbb {Z}_2) on having bases that meet certain conditions in order to construct proposed methods. Moreover, existences of ((2,2^m))-threshold secret sharing schemes are published (in NBiS2013) by using a new notion “2-propagation bases set” as a bases set in m-dimensional vector spaces over (mathbb {Z}_2). However this construction for all parameter m is wrong, in other words, it constitutes just only ((2,m(m+1)/2))-SSS, not ((2,2^m))-SSS. This paper corrects mistakes of construction and also proposes an accurate construction by using Galois field (GF(2^m)) that elements are represented in the ring (F_p[X]/f(X)) where f(X) is an irreducible polynomial, these functionalities lead to general constructions of ((2,2^m))-threshold secret sharing schemes.	secret sharing	Yuji Suga	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-65521-5_84	irreducible polynomial;prime (order theory);discrete mathematics;distributed computing;vector space;computer science;matrix (mathematics);secret sharing;galois theory	Crypto	44.554478223094954	41.18570681219349	169747

In this paper we establish a similar result for sparse polynomials. We show that a k-sparse polynomial f 2 Fq[x] of degree d _ q=2 can be recovered from its values at O(k) randomly chosen points, even if a small fraction of the values of f are adversarially corrupted. Our proof relies on an iterative technique for analyzing the rank of a random minor of a matrix.We use the same technique to establish a collection of other results.

It is the basic idea of tame congruence theory developed by Ralph McKenzie and David Hobby [7] to describe nite algebras via minimal algebras that sit inside them. As shown in [7], minimal algebras have a very restricted structure. This paper presents a new tool, the Twin Lemma, which makes it possible to give short proofs of some of these structure theorems. This part can be read as an alternative introduction to the theory. Our method yields new information in the type 1 case, and is especially useful in describing E-minimal algebras (that is, algebras that are minimal with respect to every prime congruence quotient). We complete their theory given in [7] by proving a structure theorem for the type 1 case. Finally we show that if an algebra is minimal with respect to two quotients, then the two types are the same, and if this type is 2 , 3 , or 4 , then the bodies are also equal.	congruence of squares;mv-algebra;polynomial;tame;unary operation	Emil W.

9159d927de39d366a204e312b46e413705d5b9e2	on optimal bounds of small inverse problems and approximate gcd problems with higher degree	small inverse problem;approximate gcd problem;rsa cryptosystem;lll algorithm	We show a relation between optimal bounds of a small inverse problem and an approximate GCD problem. First, we present a lattice based method to solve small inverse problems with higher degree. The problem is a natural extension of small secret exponent attack on RSA cryptosystem introduced by Boneh and Durfee. They reduced this attack to solving a bivariate modular equation: $x(A+y) \equiv 1 \pmod{e}$, where A is a given integer and e is a public exponent. They proved that the problem can be solved in polynomial time when d≤N0.292. In this paper, we extend the Boneh---Durfee's result to more general problem. For a monic polynomial h(y) of degree κ(≥1), integers C and e, we want to find all small roots of a bivariate modular equation: $xh(y)+C \equiv 0 \pmod{e}$. We denote by X and Y the upper bound of roots. We present an algorithm for solving the problem and prove that the problem can be solved in polynomial time if $\gamma \leq 1-\sqrt{\kappa \alpha}$ and |C| is small enough, where X=eγ and Y=eα. We employ a similar approach as unravelled linearization technique introduced by Herrmann and May in especially evaluating the lattice volume. Interestingly, our algorithm does not rule out the case of C=0, which implies that our algorithm can solve a univariate unknown modular equation $h(y) \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$, where p is unknown. Our algorithm achieves the best bound in the literature. Then, we show that our obtained bound is natural under the similar sense of Howgrave-Graham's discussion in CaLC2001 and we prove that our bound, including Boneh---Durfee's bound, is optimal under the reasonable assumption.	approximation algorithm	Noboru Kunihiro	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33383-5_4	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	45.874050672855226	41.187739285444295	170990

This implementation uses the NTL library from Victor Shoup, replacing some of the general purpose modules of this library by some more specialized and better suited to cryptography, and adding new modules that complement the existing ones. With this class, we can obtain the classical representation of Vector Boolean Function such as its Truth Table and Algebraic Normal Form (ANF). It is possible to calculate mathematical structures such as the Walsh Spectrum, Linear Profile, Differential Profile and Autocorrelation Spectrum. Cryptographic criteria such as nonlinearity, linearity distance, order of correlation immunity, bal-ancedness, algebraic degree and propagation criterion can be obtained with this class. It permits to find out some interesting cryptologic parameters such as linear structures, linear potential, differential potential and the maximum possible nonlinearity or linearity distance of a Vector Boolean Function with the same dimensions. Finally, operations such as to identify if two Vector Boolean Functions are equal, their sum, direct sum, composition, bricklayering, adding coordinate functions and obtaining the polynomial representation over GF(2n) of a Vector Boolean Function given the irreducible polynomial and its Truth Table are presented.	a-normal form;algebraic normal form;autocorrelation;c++;correlation immunity;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;hadamard transform;irreducible polynomial;linear algebra;mathematical structure;ntl;nonlinear system;software propagation;victor shoup	José Antonio Álvarez-Cubero;Pedro J.

The relation is established by a special system of linear equations. Using this relation we give the lower bound on the number of nonzero coefficients of polynomial that depends on the number m of moved elements. Moreover we show that there exist permutation polynomials of special form that achieve this bound when m | q − 1 . In the other direction, we show that if the number of moved elements is small then there is an recurrence relation among these coefficients. Using these recurrence relations, we improve the lower bound of nonzero coefficients when m ∤ q − 1 and m ⩽ q − 1 2 . As a byproduct, we show that the moved elements must satisfy certain polynomial equations if the mapping induces a polynomial such that there are only two nonzero coefficients out of 2 m consecutive coefficients. Finally we provide an algorithm to compute the coefficients of the polynomial induced by a given mapping with O ( q 3 / 2 ) operations.	chebyshev polynomials;coefficient;irreducibility;irreducible polynomial;rudolf berghammer;shift register;sparse matrix	Amela Muratovic-Ribic;Qiang Wang	2011	Finite Fields and Their Applications	10.1016/j.ffa.2011.04.002	irreducible polynomial;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;recurrence relation;symmetric polynomial;alternating polynomial;stable polynomial;degree of a polynomial;mathematics;factorization of polynomials;linear equation;matrix polynomial;upper and lower bounds;minimal polynomial;reciprocal polynomial;finite field;square-free polynomial;polynomial;algebra;satisfiability	Vision	41.48397072202026	38.219217024964486	171263

In computer literature, these operations are usually denoted by ADD and XOR; they are hardware implemented in all modern computers, as far as we know.* We consider two natural questions. 1. What function Zq → Zq can be expressed via these two operations? 2. What identities connect these two operations? Theorem 1 gives a complete answer to the first question; we obtain a simple fast algorithm deciding whether or not an arbitrary given function can be expressed via ADD and XOR. We also calculate the total number of k-argument functions expressible via these two operation (Corollary 1). We do not give an explicit answer to the second question, but we prove that, for each q, all identities connecting ADD and XOR follow from a finite number of such identities (Theorem 2) and there exists an algorithm writing down such a finite basis of identities for any given q (Corollary 2). The problem of existence of finite basis of identities was extensively studied for groups, semigroups, rings, linear algebras (see, for example, [BaOl88], [Neum69], [Belo99], [VaZe89], [Grish99], [Zaits78], [Keme87], [Kras90], [Laty73], [Lvov73], [Olsh89], [Shch99], [GuKr03], [Kras09], [Speht52] and literature cited therein), but the “applied” algebra with operations ADD and XOR has never been studied from this point of view, as far as we known. In algebraic term, Theorem 1 is an explicit description of the free algebras of the variety, generated by the algebra Zq with two binary operations ADD and XOR; Theorem 2 says that this variety is finitely based (i.e. it has a finite basis of identities). See, for example, [BaOl88] or [GA91] for necessary information about varieties of universal algebras. Most of Notation we use is standard. Note only that the addition modulo q (i.e. ADD) is denoted by +; the bitwise addition modulo 2 (i.e. XOR) is denote by ⊕. The symbol ai denotes the ith bit of a number a ∈ Zq; the bits with negative numbers are assumed to be zero. The set {0, 1, . . . , q−1} = Zq when considered as a universal algebra with operations + and ⊕ is denoted by the symbol Aq.

For a projective plane of order q, we prove that s ≤ 1 + (q + 1)(√q − 1) and we also show that equality can be attained in this bound whenever q is an even power of two. For a Steiner triple system on v points, we prove that s ≤ (2v+ 5− √ 24v + 25)/2 and we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for equality to be attained in this bound.	power of two;steiner tree problem	Douglas R.

Its content is extensive and profound, and the matrix is an important part of mathematics. It can be seen in many fields. For example, in game theory and economics, the payoff matrix is used to represent the payoff of two game objects in various decision modes. Early cryptographic techniques, such as the Hill code, also used matrix. In the field of chemistry, where quantum theory is used to discuss molecular bonds and spectra, the matrix is applied. In physics, matrices have applications in electronics, mechanics, optics and quantum physics. In the field of computer engineering, it is more widely used, such as computer image processing, 3D animation production, text mining and its’ inverted index technology. Therefore, this paper mainly focuses on matrix operations and its application in personalized recommendation methods. This paper adopts recommendation method based on bipartite graph. This method improves the accuracy of recommendation effectively. The experimental results verify its feasibility.	algorithm;collaborative filtering;computer engineering;cryptography;game mechanics;game theory;graph theory;image processing;inverted index;numerical linear algebra;personalization;quantum mechanics;recommender system;text mining;the matrix;theory of computation	Fang Dong;Yinmei Lv	2018	2018 IEEE/ACIS 17th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS)	10.1109/ICIS.2018.8466378	computer animation;inverted index;game theory;normal-form game;matrix multiplication;computer engineering;stochastic game;matrix (mathematics);mathematics;text mining	ML	51.6569159757477	36.03293325685632	171354

Nathanson [Nathanson] finds the highest order term of the asymptotic formula for the number of partitions with parts in a finite set. This is done without referring to the partial fraction expansion of the generating function. In this paper, we essentially find the entire asymptotic formula without using partial fractions. This is done by the “metaphysical method” described in [Almkvist 98]. There the asymptotic formula was found using Fourier transformations of distributions in a rather obscure way. But when the generating function is rational, it is shown here that the method is perfectly sound. This is based on the following result:	fast fourier transform	Gert Almkvist	2002	Experimental Mathematics	10.1080/10586458.2002.10504696	combinatorics;additive number theory;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algebra	DB	40.813093466755085	35.80375996108809	171844

As such, they have been wellstudied, and have been used in several cryptographic applications. Vélu’s formulas show how to explicitly evaluate an isogeny, given a specification of the kernel as a list of points. However, Vélu’s formulas only work for elliptic curves specified by a Weierstrass equation. This paper presents formulas similar to Vélu’s that can be used to evaluate isogenies on Edwards curves and Huff curves, which are normal forms of elliptic curves that provide an alternative to the traditional Weierstrass form. Our formulas are not simply compositions of Vélu’s formulas with mappings to and from Weierstrass form. Our alternate derivation yields efficient formulas for isogenies with lower algebraic complexity than such compositions. In fact, these formulas have lower algebraic complexity than Vélu’s formulas on Weierstrass curves.	algorithm;arithmetic circuit complexity;bézier curve;computation;computational problem;cryptosystem;database normalization;elliptic curve cryptography;hessian;high-frequency direction finding;jacobi method;linear algebra;map;mathematical optimization;newton–cotes formulas;public-key cryptography;utility functions on indivisible goods;yet another	Dustin Moody;Daniel Shumow	2011	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1090/mcom/3036	supersingular elliptic curve;twisted edwards curve;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;twists of curves;tripling-oriented doche–icart–kohel curve;hyperelliptic curve cryptography;edwards curve;mathematics;geometry;hessian form of an elliptic curve;elliptic curve;hyperelliptic curve;schoof's algorithm;algebra	Crypto	44.78647118299036	39.315918985381714	171867

I note that one may often readily determine the coefficients in those relations by elementary linear algebra. I begin with some musings on here called ‘determined sequences’, and continue with detail on continued fraction expansion of square roots of polynomials and associated Somos type sequences particularly in the genus 1 and 2 cases. 1 Remarks on Determined Sequences 1.1 Michael Somos’ Sequences The canonical details are given in [8], but for story telling purposes1 let me introduce the matter as follows. Some fifteen years ago, Michael Somos noticed [8] that the two-sided sequence Ch−2Ch+2 = Ch−1Ch+1 + C2 h, 1 Referee 1 warns me that grossly simplified (in plain language: falsified) stories will not do. More precisely, David Gale [8] reports that Michael Somos discovered the apparent integrality of 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 23, 75, 421, 1103, 4057, 41783, . . . , namely 6-Somos, leading others to investigate 4-Somos and 5-Somos; specifically, Janice Malouf was the first to prove the integrality of 4-Somos. The trouble was that the early integrality proofs (of 4, 5, and 6-Somos) seemingly relied on algebraic accident and could not properly be said to give any explanation. To me, it seemed sufficient to mention a first-hand source allowing readers to replace legend by history. However, all this did provoke me to reread [8] alerting me to a number of interesting facts I had quite forgotten. I use this aside also to report a recent note of Chris Swart and Andy Hone [19] giving an alternative proof that the Th satisfying (1) are Laurent polynomials in the initial data, and sharper integrality conditions than immediately derivable from [7]. Referee 2 adds that “[this alternative] proof is based on (6) with t = 1 and the analogous formula with asymmetric shifts, and there is also a (much more verbose) discussion similar in spirit to §1.2.” F. Hess, S. Pauli, and M. Pohst (Eds.): ANTS 2006, LNCS 4076, pp. 393–405, 2006. c © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006 394 A.J. van der Poorten which I refer to as 4-Somos in his honour, apparently takes only integer values if we start from C−1 , C0 , C1 , C2 = 1. Indeed, Somos goes on to investigate also the width 5 sequence, Bh−2Bh+3 = Bh−1Bh+2 +BhBh+1 , now with five initial 1s, the width 6 sequence Dh−3Dh+3 = Dh−2Dh+2+Dh−1Dh+1+D h , and so on, testing whether each, when initiated by an appropriate number of 1s, yields only integers. Naturally, he asks: “What is going on here?” While 4-Somos (A006720), 5-Somos (A006721), 6-Somos (A006722), and 7-Somos (A006723), do yield only integers; 8-Somos does not. The codes in parentheses refer to Neil Sloane’s On-line encyclopedia of integer sequences. Fomin and Zelevinsky [7] give an algebraic explanation. For example, their theory of cluster algebras entails that a sequence (Th) satisfying αTh−2Th+2 + βTh−1Th+1 + γT 2 h = 0 , for all h ∈ Z , (1) has the Th Laurent polynomials in the four initial values over Z[β/α, γ/α] . 1.2 Self-determining Relations Suppose we are given a family T of sequences (Th) all satisfying a relation (1) with constant coefficients α , β , γ not all zero depending only on the family T . Further, there is no loss of generality in supposing that our family T contains a singular sequence, (Wh) say, here specified by W0 = 0. Then we readily determine the nontrivial coefficients by noting that Δ0,1,h = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ W−2W2 W−1W1 0 W−1W3 0 W 2 1 Wh−2Wh+2 Wh−1Wh+1 W 2 h ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = W−1W 3 1 Wh−2Wh+2 − W−2W2W 2 1 Wh−1Wh+1 − W 2 −1W1W3W 2 h = 0 . (2) In the context I have in mind, (Wh) is in fact anti-symmetric: W−h = −Wh , and clearly W1 = 0 must be supposed, so our determination yields W 2 1 Th−2Th+2 = W 2 2 Th−1Th+1 − W1W3T 2 h . (3) Whatever, given that there is a relation as described, one readily identifies its coefficients in terms of several initial elements of a, or the, singular sequence in the family. 1.3 Elliptic Sequences In the sequel I discuss curves C : Z2 − AZ − R = 0 with polynomial coefficients A and R satisfying deg A = g + 1, 0 < deg R ≤ g . Disclaimer. Here and throughout below I disregard the possibility that the given curve is of genus lower than g . In particular, if C is of genus zero then the continued fraction expansions are different from what we assert generic below. Determined Sequences, Continued Fractions, and Hyperelliptic Curves 395 In the case g = 1, set R = v(X − w). The transformation U = Z V − v = XU (4) transforms C into a Weierstrass model E for an elliptic curve, in effect by taking one of the points, say S, at infinity on C to SE = (0, 0) on E . It is an interesting but non-trivial exercise to confirm that there are welldefined integers Uh , Vh , Wh so that the rational points hSE for h ∈ Z have co-ordinates of the shape (Uh/W 2 h , Vh/W 3 h) satisfying gcd(Uh, Vh) = Wh−1 and Uh = −Wh−1Wh+1 ; (5) all this up to at most finitely many primes. For details see Rachel Shipsey’s thesis [16]. It follows, as long ago observed by Morgan Ward [20], that there is indeed a sequence Wh as above satisfying Wh−mWh+mW 2 t = W 2 mWh−tWh+t − Wm−tWm+tW 2 h (6) for all integers h , m , and t . It turns out [14], given an arbitrary point ME on E , that just so the ‘denominators’ Th of the ‘translated’ points ME + hSE satisfy W 2 t Th−mTh+m = W 2 mTh−tTh+t − Wm−tWm+tT 2 h . (7) It is easy to check that (6) is self-determining as h or t varies but to prove the identity requires showing, say by induction on m as in [14], that it is implied by the particular case (3) where m = 2. Such an argument does not require an understanding of the genesis of the family of sequences exemplified by (Th). Alternatively, one might recognise (Th) as an ‘elliptic sequence’, identify the corresponding elliptic curve by analytic means, and prove (7) as coming from an identity satisfied by the relevant ℘-function. That’s done by Ward [20], and rather more directly by Andy Hone [9]. Below I explain the identification by algebraic methods of M and the curve C , or E . It is intriguing that the recursion (3) depends only on the curve, but that four nonzero initial values of Th are required both to fix the curve among a class of admissible curves and to find the translation M . 1.4 Division Polynomials One might remark that there is gain in generality in having changed the transformation, by U ← (U − x), V ← (V − y), whereby in effect the co-efficients of E become polynomials in x and y and S is sent to SE = (x, y). The result is that the integers Wh become polynomials Wh(x, y) with the evident property that Wm(a, b) = 0 if and only if (a, b) is a point of torsion order dividing m . In other words, Wh(x, y) is the h-th division polynomial. That inter alia entails gcd ( Wr(x, y), Ws(x, y) ) = Wgcd(r,s)(x, y), explaining the division properties of the Wh(0, 0) and — conversely — the rapid growth of the coefficients of the division polynomials. 396 A.J. van der Poorten 1.5 Hyperelliptic Sequences The formulas (4) so relate the cubic and quartic models that the recursion relations for division polynomials produced from studying the quartic model coincide with those produced by the more familiar cubic model. One cannot expect that to be so if g > 1. It should therefore be no special surprise that sequences obtained by David Cantor [5] by studying Padé approximants to square roots of polynomials of odd degree 2g + 1 and with constant coefficient say 1, viewed as power series about zero, are not the same as sequences I obtain below from the continued fraction expansion of square roots of monic polynomials of even degree viewed as Laurent series about infinity. Just so, the results obtained in [3] by studying Kleinian σ -functions in genus 2 are not immediately applicable to my discussion below. 2 Continued Fraction of the Square Root of a Polynomial Suppose A(X) denotes a polynomial of degree g + 1 and R(X) a polynomial of positive degree at most g .

In this paper we classify all rational functions φ ∈ Fq(x) of degree 3 that induce a permutation of P(Fq). Our methods are constructive and the classification is explicit: we provide equations for the coefficients of the rational functions using Galois theoretical methods and Chebotarev Density Theorem for global function fields. As a corollary, we obtain that a permutation rational function of degree 3 permutes Fq if and only if it permutes infinitely many of its extension fields. As another corollary, we derive the well-known classification of permutation polynomials of degree 3.	coefficient;permutation polynomial;whole earth 'lectronic link	Andrea Ferraguti;Giacomo Micheli	2018	CoRR		mathematical analysis;corollary;permutation;if and only if;mathematics;finite field;polynomial;rational function;prime power	ML	42.4789719044583	37.1701386454404	172342

Our parametric state and time spaces are respectively graded parametric Lie algebra and graded ring. As a consequence, the parametric state space is also a graded module. Parameter space is observed as an integral domain as well as a vector space, while the near-identity parameter map acts on the parametric state space. The method of multiple Lie bracket is used to obtain an infinite order parametric normal form of codimension-one Hopf singularity. Filtration topology is revisited and proved that state, parameter and time (near-identity) maps are continuous. Furthermore, parametric normal form is a convergent process with respect to filtration topology.

The spectrum of values of v for which there exists a 1-rotational STS(v) under a cyclic, an abelian, or a dicyclic group, has been established in Phelps and Rosa (Discrete Math 33:57–66, 1981), Buratti (J Combin Des 9:215–226, 2001) and Mishima (Discrete Math 308:2617– 2619, 2008), respectively. Nevertheless, the spectrum of values of v for which there exists a 1-rotational STS(v) under an arbitrary group has not been completely determined yet. This paper is a considerable step forward to the solution of this problem. In fact, we leave as uncertain cases only those for which we have v = (p3 − p)n + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 96) with p a prime, n ≡ 0 (mod 4), and the odd part of (p3 − p)n that is square-free and without prime factors congruent to 1 (mod 6).	discrete mathematics;emoticon;existential quantification;graph automorphism;hoare logic;like button;modulo operation;square-free polynomial;steiner tree problem;école nationale des chartes	Simona Bonvicini;Marco Buratti;Gloria Rinaldi;Tommaso Traetta	2012	Des.

f4d2c838968656a1610b282f3e0df9d6cd7b7866	labeled factorization of integers	combinatorial identities;generalized stirling numbers	The labeled factorizations of a positive integer n are obtained as a completion of the set of ordered factorizations of n. This follows a new technique for generating ordered factorizations found by extending a method for unordered factorizations that relies on partitioning the multiset of prime factors of n. Our results include explicit enumeration formulas and some combinatorial identities. It is proved that labeled factorizations of n are equinumerous with the systems of complementing subsets of {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}. We also give a new combinatorial interpretation of a class of generalized Stirling numbers. 1 Ordered and labeled factorization An ordered factorization of a positive integer n is a representation of n as an ordered product of integers, each factor greater than 1. The set of ordered factorizations of n will be denoted by F (n), and |F (n)| = f(n). For example, F (6) = {6, 2.3, 3.2}. So f(6) = 3. Every integer n > 1 has a canonical factorization into prime numbers p1, p2, . . ., namely n = p1 1 p m2 2 . . . p mr r , p1 < p2 < · · · < pr, mi > 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ r. (1) The enumeration function f(n) does not depend on the size of n but on the exponents mi. In particular we define Ω(n) = m1 + m2 + · · · + mr, Ω(1) = 0. Note that the form of (1) may sometimes suggest a formula for f(n). For instance, • n = p gives f(n) = 2, the number of compositions of m. the electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R50 1 • n = p1p2 . . . pr gives f(n) = r ∑ k=1 k!S(r, k), the r ordered Bell number; S(n, k) is the Stirling number of the second kind. A general formula for the number f(n, k) of ordered k-factorizations of n was found in 1893 by MacMahon [9] (also [1, p. 59]):	integer factorization	Augustine O. Munagi	2009	Electr. J.

More concretely, we have developed some algorithms which, making use of the effective homology method, construct the homology groups of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces K(G, 1) for different groups G, allowing one in particular to determine the homology groups of G. Ours algorithms have been programmed as new modules for the Kenzo system, enhancing it with the following new functionalities: • construction of the effective homology of K(G, 1) from a given finite free resolution of the group G; • construction of the effective homology of K(A, 1) for every finitely generated Abelian group A (as a consequence, the effective homology of K(A, n) is also available in Kenzo, for all n ∈ N); • computation of homology groups of some 2-types; • construction of the effective homology for central extensions. In addition, an inverse problem is also approached in this work: given a group G such that K(G, 1) has effective homology, can a finite free resolution of the group G be obtained? We provide some algorithms to solve this problem, based on a notion of norm of a group, allowing us to control the convergence of the process when building such a resolution.	algorithm;bruce ellis;cartesian closed category;computation;experiment;graham scan;homology (biology);linear algebra;point of view (computer hardware company);twisted;x-machine	Ana Romero;Julio Rubio	2012	J.

cbb2536a7ea18cc928a52967630dc4354e09f4fa	a generalization of schönemann's theorem via a graph theoretic method		Recently, Grynkiewicz et al. [Israel J. Math. 193 (2013), 359–398], using tools from additive combinatorics and group theory, proved necessary and sufficient conditions under which the linear congruence a1x1+ · · ·+akxk ≡ b (mod n), where a1, . . . , ak, b, n (n ≥ 1) are arbitrary integers, has a solution 〈x1, . . . , xk〉 ∈ Z k n with all xi distinct modulo n. So, it would be an interesting problem to give an explicit formula for the number of such solutions. Quite surprisingly, this problem was first considered, in a special case, by Schönemann almost two centuries ago(!) but his result seems to have been forgotten. Schönemann [J. Reine Angew. Math. 1839 (1839), 231–243] proved an explicit formula for the number of such solutions when b = 0, n = p a prime, and ∑k i=1 ai ≡ 0 (mod p) but ∑ i∈I ai 6≡ 0 (mod p) for all I {1, . . . , k}. In this paper, we generalize Schönemann’s theorem using a result on the number of solutions of linear congruences due to D. N. Lehmer and also a result on graph enumeration recently obtained by Ardila et al. [Int. Math. Res. Not. 2015 (2015), 3830–3877]. This seems to be a rather uncommon method in the area; besides, our proof technique or its modifications may be useful for dealing with other cases of this problem (or even the general case) or other relevant problems.	arithmetic combinatorics;bell's theorem;congruence of squares;graph enumeration;graph theory;modulo operation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Khodakhast Bibak;Bruce M.

It is first shown that the set of polynomials serving as loop invariants has the algebraic structure of an ideal. Using this connection, a procedure for finding loop invariants is given in terms of operations on ideals, for which Grobner basis constructions can be employed. Most importantly, it is proved that if the assignment statements in a loop are solvable (in particular, affine) mappings with positive eigenvalues, then the procedure terminates in at most 2m+1 iterations, where m is the number of variables in the loop. The proof is done by showing that the irreducible subvarieties of the variety associated with the polynomial ideal approximating the invariant polynomial ideal of the loop either stay the same or increase their dimension in every iteration. This yields a correct and complete algorithm for inferring conjunctions of polynomial equations as invariants. The method has been implemented in Maple using the Groebner package. The implementation has been used to automatically discover nontrivial invariants for several examples to illustrate the power of the techniques.	algorithm;decision problem;gröbner basis;imperative programming;invariant (computer science);invariant polynomial;irreducibility;irreducible complexity;iteration;linear algebra;loop invariant;maple	Enric Rodríguez-Carbonell;Deepak Kapur	2004		10.1145/1005285.1005324	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;bracket polynomial;gröbner basis;mathematics;loop invariant;algebra	PL	48.532569318001144	36.09143695828245	175482

Let g(A): = |A + A| + |A · A|, where A+A = {a1 +a2 | ai ∈ A} and A ·A = {a1a2 | ai ∈ A} are the sumset and productset. We prove that if the determinant of the difference of any two distinct matrices in A is nonzero, then g(A) cannot be bounded below by cN for any constant c. We also prove that if A is a set of d× d symmetric matrices, then there exists ε = ε(d) > 0 such that g(A) > N. For the first result, we use the bound on the number of factorizations in a generalized progression. For the symmetric case, we use a technical proposition which provides an affine space V containing a large subset E of A with the property that if an algebraic property holds for a large subset of E, then it holds for V . Then we show that the system {a2: a ∈ V } is commutative, allowing us to decompose R as eigenspaces simultaneously, so we can finish the proof with induction and a variant of Erdős-Szemerédi argument. Introduction. Let A be a finite subset of a ring, and let |A| denote the cardinality of the set A. The sum set and the product set of A are A + A : = {a1 + a2 | ai ∈ A}, A ·A : = {a1a2 | ai ∈ A}.

These algorithms can be used for constructing and evaluating polynomials interpolating the function values and its derivatives of arbitrary order (Hermite interpolation). For interpolation, the parallel arithmetic complexity is 0(log2 M + log N) for large M and N, where M 1 is the order of the highest derivative information and N is the number of distinct points used. Unlike alternate approaches which use the Lagrange representation, the algorithms described in this paper are based on the fast parallel evaluation of a closed formula for the generalized divided differences. Applications to the solution of dual Vandermonde and confluent Vandermonde systems are described. This work extends previous results in polynomial interpolation and improves the parallel time complexity of existing algorithms.

The group F̄ is torsion free (see [1]), but it is unknown whether the group ring KF̄ of F̄ over the field K is a domain. This is true for some special cases of groups, for instance for the case when the group G is residually finite; it was proven in [5] that if G = F/N is residually {soluble-by-finite group} then the group ring KF̄ is a domain and embeds in a division ring D. We consider in this paper the division ring D in the case when the group G is a residually {finite p-group} or, more generally, G is a residually {soluble p-group} and char(K) > p − p + 1. We prove that if f̄1, f̄2 are two elements of F̄ whose images in F̄ /N̄ ∼= G generate a noncyclic subgroup G1 ⊆ G, then the elements 1+ f̄1 and 1+ f̄2 generate a noncyclic free subgroup in the multiplicative group D∗; more generally, if α and β are two nonzero elements of K, then each of two pairs	division by zero;torsion (gastropod)	Jairo Z.

The subroutines are based on a factorization method for comput ing g-splines discussed by Munteanu and Schumaker (Math. Comp. 27 (1973), 317-325). Description 1. bltroduction. In the following we present subroutines for calculating polynomial spline functions solving Hermite-Birkhoff (HB) interpolation problems. The subroutines are based on algori thms described in [9]. We begin by reviewing the definition of an HB-interpolation problem. Let N >_ 2 and xz < x,. < . . . < x N be prescribed. Suppose for each j, 1 < j < N, that zi is a positive integer, I M 1 j < I M ~ j < • • • < l M ~ i j are positive integers, and y~.:, y~.j, . . . , y~ . j are prescribed real numbers. The HB-interpolation problem is to determine s such that S(tMii--I)(Xi) = Y i j , i = 1, 2, . . . , zj, j = 1, 2, . . . , N. (1) We see that z j describes the number of derivatives prescribed at x j while the vector (IMI.j, . . . , lMzs. j) describes which derivatives. If z) = 1, j = 1, . . . , N, we have a simple interpolation problem. We are concerned with solving: HB-interpolation problems with polynomial splines. Let M be an integer, M >_ IMzj . i , j = 1, 2, . . . , N. Then (cf. [4]) there exists a function s satisfying (1) and s(2U)(t) = O, xj < t < x~+x, j = 1, 2, . . . , N 1; (2) s(M)(t) = 0, t < X~. t > Xlv; (3) s C C(~-z~( ° : , o¢); (4) s~ -""""u-~ (xs+) = s~ ~--~-~) (xi-) , (5) l C {l . . . . . M} \ { IM,5, . . . , IM~j. j} j = 1,2, . . . , N . The function s is called a g-spline. It is a polynomial spline o f degree 2M -1 ; i.e. it is piecewise a polynomial o f degree 2M 1. The way in which the pieces tie together is described by (4) and (5). If the only polynomial o f degree M 1 which solves the homogeneous HB-interpolation problem (i.e. satisfies (1) with zero right-hand side) is the identically zero polynomial, then we say the HB-problem is M-poised. In this case there is a unique g-spline of degree 2M-1 solving the HB-problem (1). We consider constructing g-splines only for M-poised HB-problems. Given an M-poised HB-interpolat ion problem, the unique g-spline interpolant s satisfying (1)-115) can be represented as ~p,(t), t < xl s(t) = ~pi(t) , .rj-z < t ~ x ~ , j = 2, 3, . . . , N, (6) [pN+l(t), t > XN, where f o r j = 1, 2, . . . , N, ps(t) is a polynomial of the form 2 M pj( t ) = ~ C t . s ( t xs) z-1 and (7) l=1"""	algorithm;binary prefix;birkhoff interpolation;computation;constant function;degree (graph theory);existential quantification;hermite polynomials;polynomial;spline (mathematics);subroutine	Harold D.

It was shown to be balanced only in the case p and q are twin primes or p and q are cousin primes with p ≡ q ≡ 3(mod4). In the case gcd(p − 1,q − 1) = 2, where p and q are two distinct primes, a modification of the binary two-prime Sidelnikov sequence is proposed in this paper. We show that the new defined sequence is always balanced.

We establish a series of structural theorems about these proof systems, the main one stating that P<sub>c</sub>(F) proofs can be balanced: if a polynomial identity of syntactic degree d and depth k has a P<sub>c</sub>(F) proof of size s, then it also has a P<sub>c</sub>(F) proof of size poly(s,d) and depth O(k+log<sup>2</sup> d + log d• log s). As a corollary, we obtain a quasipolynomial simulation of P<sub>c</sub>(F) by P<sub>f</sub>(F), for identities of a polynomial syntactic degree. Using these results we obtain the following: consider the identities: det(XY) = det(X)•det(Y) and det(Z)= z<sub>11</sub> ••• z<sub>nn</sub>, where X,Y and Z are n x n square matrices and Z is a triangular matrix with z<sub>11</sub>,..., z<sub>nn</sub> on the diagonal (and det is the determinant polynomial). Then we can construct a polynomial-size arithmetic circuit det such that the above identities have P<sub>c</sub>(F) proofs of polynomial-size and O(log<sup>2</sup>n) depth. Moreover, there exists an arithmetic formula det of size n<sup>O(log n)</sup> such that the above identities have P<sub>f</sub>(F) proofs of size n<sup>O(log n)</sup>.  This yields a solution to a basic open problem in propositional proof complexity, namely, whether there are polynomial-size NC<sup>2</sup>-Frege proofs for the determinant identities and the <i>hard matrix identities</i>, as considered, e.g. in Soltys and Cook (2004) (cf., Beame and Pitassi (1998).

a6d9b97b0632067bb9c9da07b6f10051b5d9d071	the pythagorean theorem: what is it about?		Although twenty five centuries old, the Pythagorean theorem appears vigorous and ubiquitous. A key to the distance formula in Descartes’s method of coordinates, the theorem is implicitly present in all scientific models and engineering computations involving spatial relationships or trigonometry. An invisible companion to the dot-product operation, it is inherent in equations of mathematical physics and continuum mechanics, be those Laplace, NavierStokes, Maxwell or Yang-Mills. Disguised by axiomatic constructions of linear algebra and Riemannian geometry, it animates both quantum physics and Einstein’s gravitation, which are otherwise so hard to reconcile. And of course, a rare day of a statistician or experimenter goes by without Euclid’s nightmare— fitting any three or more points into a straight line, which is accomplished by Gaussian least squares and hence is also reminiscent of Pythagoras. Quite deservedly, therefore, the philosopher’s pants are proudly displayed in middle-school textbooks to represent, perhaps, the only scientific truth circulating among the general public “with proof.” The most popular one (shown in Figure 1) is very convincing indeed. Yet it pictures the whole issue as a cut-and-paste puzzle and leaves us with a feeling of disproportion: one of the most fundamental facts of nature is due to an ingenious tiling trick. The vast majority of other proofs 1 are similar in nature.	byers-yang theorem;computation;cut, copy, and paste;euclid;image;least squares;linear algebra;maxwell (microarchitecture);multiply–accumulate operation;quantum mechanics;tiling window manager;triune continuum paradigm;yang	Alexander Givental	2006	The American Mathematical Monthly		calculus;mathematics;geometry	Theory	52.18181449748656	33.53462893924284	177738

It uses an expected number of field operations (and certain random choices) that is polynomial in the size of sparse representations of input plus output, provided the number of irreducible factors is bounded. We thus obtain probabilistic polynomial-time factoring procedures over algebraic number fields and over finite fields. The reduction is based on an effective version of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem.	integer factorization	Joachim von zur Gathen;Erich Kaltofen	1985	J. Comput. Syst.

This paper presents a public-key scheme which necessarily requires knowledge of the factorization of its modulus in order to be broken. Rabin introduced the first system whose security is equivalent to the difficulty of factoring the modulus. His scheme is based on squaring (cubing) for encryption and extracting square (cube) roots for decryption. This introduces a 1:4 (1:9) ambiguity in the decryption. Various schemes which overcome this problem have been introduced for both the quadratic and cubic case. We generalize the ideas of Williams' cubic system to larger prime exponents. The cases of higher prime order introduce a number of problems not encountered in the quadratic and cubic cases, namely the existence of fundamental units in the underlying cyclotomic field, the evaluation of higher power residue symbols, and the increased difficulty of Euclidean division in the field.

The invariance of a switching function under a single interchange of two variables can be readily detected from the equality of some of the residues of expansion about these two variables. This procedure of detecting invariance is directly applied for the identification of total or partial symmetry of a switching function whose variables of symmetry may be either all unprimed (or all primed), mixed, or of multiform nature.	numerical method;sensor	S.

f2a6eed10a1f76e3cd0bf8846ab9ffff324c122a	weight = nonlinearity for all small weight boolean functions		Given a Boolean function f , the (Hamming) weight wt(f) and the nonlinearity N(f) are well known to be important in designing functions that are useful in cryptography. The nonlinearity is expensive to compute, in general, so any shortcuts for doing that for particular functions f are significant. It is clear from the definitions that wt(f) ≤ N(f). We give a useful and practical sufficient condition for the weight and nonlinearity to be equal, namely wt(f) ≤ 2 if f has n variables. It is shown that this inequality cannot be improved, in general. This condition can also be used to actually compute the nonlinearity in some cases. As an application, we give a simple proof for the value of the nonlinearity of the well known majority function.

This means isolating all common real solutions in rational rectangles and calculating the respective multiplicities. Second, the computation of the sign of bivariate polynomials evaluated at two algebraic numbers of arbitrary degree. Our main motivation comes from nonlinear computational geometry and computer-aided design, where bivariate polynomials lie at the inner loop of many algorithms. The methods employed are based on Sturm-Habicht sequences, univariate resultants and rational univariate representation. We have implemented them very carefully, using advanced object-oriented programming techniques, so as to achieve high practical performance. The algorithms are integrated in the public-domain C++ software library synaps, and their efficiency is illustrated by 9 experiments against existing implementations. Our code is faster in most cases; sometimes it is even faster than numerical approaches.	algebraic equation;algorithm;bernard galler;bivariate data;c++;computation;computational geometry;computer-aided design;context of computational complexity;experiment;inner loop;library (computing);linear algebra;maniac mansion;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;polynomial;resultant;sturm's theorem	Ioannis Z.

7cd30e20e3de4ddf9ed2b4578ec4448bd518c642	polynomial equations and circulant matrices		1. INTRODUCTION. There is something fascinating about procedures for solving low degree polynomial equations. On one hand, we all know that while general solutions (using radicals) are impossible beyond the fourth degree, they have been found for quadratics, cubics, and quartics. On the other hand, the standard solutions for the the cubic and quartic are complicated, and the methods seem ad hoc. How is a person supposed to remember them? It just seems that there ought to be a simple, memorable, unified method for all equations through degree four. Approaches to unification have been around almost as long as the solutions themselves. In 1545, Cardano published solutions to both the cubic and quartic, attributing the former to Tartaglia and the latter to Ferrari. After subsequent work failed to solve equations of higher degree, Lagrange undertook an analysis in 1770 to explain why the methods for cubics and quartics are successful. From that time right down to the present, efforts have persisted to illuminate the solutions of cubic and quartic equations ; see [21]. In this paper we present a unified approach based on circulant matrices. The idea is to construct a circulant matrix with a specified characteristic polynomial. The roots of the polynomial thus become eigenvalues, which are trivially found for circulant matrices. This circulant matrix approach provides a beautiful unity to the solutions of cubic and quartic equations, in a form that is easy to remember. It also reveals other interesting insights and connections between matrices and polynomials, as well as cameo roles for interpolation theory and the discrete Fourier transform. We begin with a brief review of circulants, and then show how circulants can be used to find the zeroes of low degree polynomials. Succeeding sections explore how the circulant method is related to other approaches, present additional applications of circulants in the study of polynomial roots, and discuss generalizations using other classes of matrices.	characteristic polynomial;circulant matrix;cubic function;discrete fourier transform;eyetoy;hoc (programming language);interpolation;quartic function;unification (computer science)	Dan Kalman;James E.

Complexity can be reduced if this polynomial has prefactors, i.e., factors of its univariate constituent polynomials that are independent of the received vector, and hence known a priori. For example, the well-known re-encoding projection due to Koetter et al. leads to one class of prefactors. This paper introduces so-called Sierpínski prefactors that result from the property that many binomial coefficients, which arise in the multiplicity constraints defined in terms of the Hasse derivative, are zero modulo the underlying field characteristic. It is shown that re-encoding prefactors and Sierpínski prefactors can be combined to achieve a significantly reduced Guruswami-Sudan interpolation step. In certain practically relevant cases, the introduction of Sierpínski prefactors reduces the number of unknown polynomial coefficients by an additional 10% or more (beyond the reduction due to re-encoding prefactors alone), without incurring additional computational effort at the decoder.	algorithm;bivariate data;coefficient;complexity;cubic function;folded reed–solomon code;gaussian elimination;global storage architecture;hasse diagram;interpolation;linear system;microsoft outlook for mac;modulo operation;polynomial;pseudocode;soft-decision decoder;system of linear equations;the matrix;whittaker–shannon interpolation formula;whole earth 'lectronic link	Christian Senger	2014	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2014.2361347	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;interpolation;mathematics;statistics;polynomial;algebra	Theory	46.78342389557826	41.640230300792915	180019

Discrete logarithm problem in Cl(D) is hard if #Cl(D) is prime or has large prime divisor. But no algorithms for generating such D are known. We propose probabilistic algorithm that gives discriminant of imaginary quadratic order with subgroup of given prime order l. Algorithm is based on properties of Hilbert class field polynomial HD for elliptic curve ( ) l p E  over field of p l elements. Let trace of Frobenius endomorphism is T, discriminant of Frobenius endomorphism D = T 2 − 4p and ( ( )) l p p j E ∉   . Then deg(HD) = #Cl(OD) and #Cl(D) ≡ 0 (mod l). If Diophantine equation D = T 2 − 4p with variables 4 ( | |) l O D < , prime p and T has solution only for l = 1, then class number is prime. 1. Class group of imaginary quadratic order Let a, b, c ∈  and Q = (a, b, c) = {ax + bxy + cy} — integral quadratic form of discriminant D = b − 4ac. Form Q is positive definite if D < 0 and a > 0. If variables x, y run through , Q runs through subset of . Equivalent forms have equal sets of values (possibly permuted). It is sufficient to consider forms with (a, b, c) = 1, D is not perfect square and a > 1. If Q is positive definite form, then Q(x, y) ≥ 0 and Q = 0 if and only if x = 0 and y = 0. All considered forms are positive definite. Equivalent forms have the same discriminant. Equivalence partitions set of forms with given discriminant into finite set of classes.

However, the proof does not directly yield specific primes l for a given algebraic number field K.

We showed that automorphism groups of complete sets of MUBs and corresponding orthogonal decompositions of Lie algebras sl n (C) are isomorphic, and in case of symplectic spreads these automorphism groups are determined by automorphism groups of that spreads. By using new notion of pseudo-planar functions over fields of characteristic two we give new explicit constructions of complete sets of MUBs.	graph automorphism;mutually unbiased bases;symplectic integrator	Kanat S.

This makes it possible for all arithmetic to be performed with the superior security of interval methods without any penalty in speed. In such a situation the IEEE floating-point standard needs to be compared with a version of floating-point arithmetic that is ideal for the purpose of interval arithmetic. Such a comparison requires a succinct and complete exposition of interval arithmetic according to its recent developments. We present such an exposition in this paper. We conclude that the directed roundings toward the infinities and the definition of division by the signed zeros are valuable features of the standard. Because the operations of interval arithmetic are always defined, exceptions do not arise. As a result neither Nans nor exceptions are needed. Of the status flags, only the inexact flag may be useful. Denormalized numbers seem to have no use for interval arithmetic; in the use of interval constraints, they are a handicap.	denormal number;exception handling;interval arithmetic;nan;signed zero	M.

The programs use discrete logarithms, employing a table of successor logarithms to perform addition. The table is computed in advance, in parallel. The system can evaluate some 4 × 106 polynomial terms per second; performance is limited by the general communication time needed for table lookup. Orbits of the p-th power bijection (also calculated in parallel) are used to deal with common symmetries arising in the calculations. The techniques are illustrated by calculations to determine the number of rational points of a polynomial surface over several fields, quantities which are useful in analyzing certain cyclic codes.	connection machine	Ernest E.

fa7e5151d9c0359d2abcdf4acc3ef89da303dccd	a new algorithm for boolean matrix factorization which admits overcovering		Abstract We present a new algorithm for general Boolean matrix factorization. The algorithm is based on two key ideas. First, it utilizes formal concepts of the factorized matrix as crucial components of constructed factors. Second, it performs steps back during the construction of factors to see if some of the already constructed factors may be improved or even eliminated in view of the subsequently added factors. The second idea is inspired by 8M—an old, previously incompletely described and virtually unknown factorization algorithm, which we analyze and describe in detail. We provide experimental evaluation of the new algorithm and compare it to 8M and two other well-known algorithms. The results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms these algorithms in terms of quality of the decompositions as well in its robustness with respect to small changes in data.	algorithm	Radim Belohlávek;Martin Trnecka	2018	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2017.12.044	logical matrix;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;matrix (mathematics);robustness (computer science);algorithm;factorization	ML	47.596614394793676	40.43384903994328	182188

The approach we use here involves characteristic set techniques;‡ these were introduced by J. F. Ritt, the founder of differential algebra. The basic idea is to write the radical differential ideal generated by a finite set Σ of differential polynomials as an intersection of differential ideals that are uniquely defined by their characteristic sets. We will call these latter differential ideals components of {Σ} and we will call their intersection the characteristic decomposition of {Σ}. With a characteristic decomposition of {Σ} we can determine whether Σ = 0 has any solution, test membership to {Σ} and study the dimension properties of {Σ}. Similar to algebraic elimination methods, by choosing an appropriate ranking, an algorithm to compute a characteristic decomposition can also answer questions like: do the solutions of Σ = 0 satisfy: — An algebraic equation? Find all such constraints. — An ordinary differential equation in one of the independent variables? Find these ordinary differential equations. — A differential equation involving only a specific subset of the dependent variables? Find these differential equations. Algorithms in differential elimination have been applied in symmetry analysis of partial differential equations (Clarkson and Mansfield, 1994; Mansfield et al., 1998) and control theory (Diop, 1991, 1992; Fliess and Glad, 1993). Ritt (1950) gave an algorithm to compute a characteristic decomposition of {Σ} where	algebraic equation;algorithm;coherence (physics);control theory;dependent ml;ibm notes;lu decomposition;linear algebra;polynomial;polynomial ring;rough set;turing test	Evelyne Hubert	2000	J.

The Hasse-Weil bound provides an estimation for the number of zeros (in Fq ×Fq) of an absolutely irreducible polynomial in Fq[X,Y ]. The Hasse-Weil bound is a consequence of the Riemann’s hypothesis for function fields over finite fields and has many applications in the arithmetic of finite fields. In this talk we explore two recent applications where two conjectures about permutation polynomials over Fq are settled for large q.

For f ∈ Pd, let Γf be the set of points for which Newton's method converges to a root, and let Af ≡ |Γf ∩ B2(O)|/|B2(O)|, i.e. the density of Γf in the ball of radius 2. For each d we consider Ad, the worst-case density Af for f ∈ Pd. In |S|, S. Smale conjectured that Ad ≫ 0 for all d ≥ 3 (it was wellknown that A1 = A2 = 1).

In particular, Ad ≫ 0 for all d.	best, worst and average case;degree (graph theory);newton's method;polynomial	Joel Friedman	1986	27th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1986)	10.1109/SFCS.1986.35	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;harmonic analysis;mathematical model;mathematics;geometry;newton's method;unit sphere;polynomial;algebra	Theory	47.5686899380191	33.951920364902094	188156

A Hurwitz locus inMg is a locus of points representing G-covers of fixed genus g with a given ramification type. The classification of Hurwitz loci of complex curves admitting G is by the computation of orbits of a suitable surface braid group acting on the generating tuples of G. When the genus of the curve is low, the braid orbits can be enumerated explicitly using GAP (Groups, Algorithm, Programming) computer algebra system and the BRAID package by Magaard, Shpectorov and Völklein. However, the length of the orbits dramatically increases with the size of G and genus of the curve. In order to handle larger orbits, we propose to break up the tuples into two or more shorter pieces which can be computed within reasonable time, and then recombine them together as direct products to form the braid orbits.	algorithm;braid;computation;computer algebra system;genus (mathematics);locus;ramification problem;routh–hurwitz stability criterion;substructural type system	Gehao Wang	2012			discrete mathematics;braid theory;pure mathematics;mathematics;algebra	Crypto	44.65749246220172	36.86872272446582	188195

Consequently, Chabauty methods may be applied to try to nd all rational points. We do this for p = 4; 5, thus proving that x 3 + y 3 = z 4 and x 3 + y 3 = z 5 have only trivial primitive solutions. In the process we meet a Ja-cobian of a curve that has more 6-torsion at any prime of good reduction than it has globally.

1b274a4f0984b769450f6065bc51f0e9d37b822d	an infinite family of inv-wilf-equivalent permutation pairs		Wilf-equivalence is one of the central concepts of pattern-avoiding permutations, and has been studied for more than thirty years. The two known infinite families of Wilf-equivalent permutation pairs, due to Stankova-West and Backelin-West-Xin, both satisfy the stronger condition of shape-Wilf-equivalence. Dokos et?al. recently studied a different strengthening of Wilf-equivalence called inv-Wilf-equivalence, which takes account of the inversion number of a permutation. They conjectured that all inv-Wilf-equivalent permutation pairs arise from trivial symmetries. We disprove this conjecture by constructing an infinite family of counterexamples derived from the permutation pair 231 and 312. The key to this construction is to generalize simultaneously the concepts of shape-Wilf-equivalence and inv-Wilf-equivalence. A further consequence is a proof of the recent Baxter-Jaggard conjecture on even-shape-Wilf-equivalent permutation pairs.		Justin H. C. Chan	2015	Eur. J.

Three thousand years elapsed before European mathematicians determined how to express the roots of cubic and quartic equations in terms of radicals, and there they stopped, for their techniques did not extend. Lagrange published a treatise which discussed why the methods that worked for polynomials of degree less than five did not work for quintic polynomials [Lag],  They require double exponential time. Through the years other mathematicians developed alternate algorithms all of which, however, remained exponential. A major impasse was the problem of factoring polynomials, for until the recent breakthrough of Lenstra, Lenstra, and Lovász [L3], all earlier algorithms had exponential running time. Their algorithm, which factors polynomials over the rationals in polynomial time, gave rise to a hope that some of the classical questions of Galois theory might have polynomial time solutions.  Galois transformed the question of solvability by radicals from a problem concerning fields to a problem about groups. What we do is to change the inquiry into several problems concerning the solvability of certain primitive groups.	algorithm;arjen lenstra;cubic function;exptime;integer factorization;polynomial;quadratic equation;quartic function;quintic function;time complexity	Susan Landau;Gary L.

In this paper we present a quantum information-theoretic proof of the relation between the two problems that is asymptotic in one direction. This result has previously been obtained by Klyachko using geometric invariant theory [1]. The work presented in this paper does not, however, touch upon the non-asymptotic equivalence between the two problems, a result that rests on the recently proven saturation conjecture for GL(d, C) [2].	coefficient;information theory;irreducibility;quantum information;regular expression;richardson number;turing completeness	Matthias Christandl	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-69407-6_13	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;quantum information;irreducible representation;geometric invariant theory;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	43.43150939820556	33.65698667146951	189866

One such representation is wrNAF proposed by Takagi et al. at the international conference on information security 2004 (ISC 2004). This representation is obtained from right to left. In this paper, we present a new signed-digit radix-r representation with the same average weight, that is r 1 wðr 1Þþ1 as the wrNAF. The new representation uses the same digits as the wrNAF but has the advantage that it can be deduced using a left-to-right algorithm. Further, we show that like the wrNAF, the new representation has a minimal number of non-zero digits. Interleaved with the leftto-right scalar multiplication, the new representation can reduce both the time and space complexity of the computation compared to the right-to-left wrNAF. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The main result is that under certain condition, the number of ways to factor a d-cycle into a product of cycles of prescribed lengths is d r-2. To prove our result, we first define a new class of combinatorial objects, multi-noded rooted trees, which generalize rooted trees. We find the cardinality of this new class which with proper parameters is exactly d r-2. The main part of this paper is the proof that there is a bijection from factorizations of a d-cycle to multi-noded rooted trees via factorization graphs. This implies the desired formula. The factorization problem we consider has its origin in geometry, and is related to the study of a special family of Hurwitz numbers: pure-cycle Hurwitz numbers. Via the standard translation of Hurwitz numbers into group theory, our main result is equivalent to the following: when the genus is 0 and one of the ramification indices is d, the degree of the covers, the pure-cycle Hurwitz number is d r-3, where r is the number of branch points.

The reductions can be used for finding the rank and left nullspace of such matrices. When specialized to matrices of skew polynomials our reduction can be used for computing a weak Popov form of such matrices and for computing a GCRD and an LCLM of skew polynomials or matrices of skew polynomials. The algorithm is suitable for computation in exact arithmetic domains where the growth of coefficients in intermediate computations is a concern.

The summation is taken over the set of all permutations π of n elements. Avoiding divisions seems attractive when working over a commutative ring which is not a field, for example when the entries are integers, polynomials, or rational or even more complicated expressions. Such determinants arise in combinatorial problems, see [11]. We will describe an O(n4) algorithm that works without divisions, and we will look at this algorithm from a combinatorial and an algebraic viewpoint. We will also consider the Pfaffian of a skew-symmetric matrix, a quantity closely related to the determinant. The results are in many ways analogous to those for the determinant, but the algebraic aspect of the algorithms is not explored yet. This survey is yet another article which highlights the close connection between linear algebra and cycles, paths, and matchings in graphs [1,17,25].

All accessible blocks are then proved to have the same growth rate for a fixed  F . If the modulus is not a power of a prime, different blocks may have different growth rates. These growth rates are identical with the Hausdorff dimensions of related fractals. The methods generalize further to yield explicit computations of the centers of mass and higher moments for the fractals.	automata theory;cellular automaton;utility functions on indivisible goods	Stephen J.

The two main ideas of the first algorithm, called LiftHybrid, are the following: First, we may leave out certain terms of module elements during the computation which do not contribute to the result. These terms are called lower order terms, see Definition 4.2. Second, we do not need to order the remaining terms of these module elements during the computation. This significantly reduces the number of monomial comparisons for the arithmetic operations. For the second algorithm, called LiftTree, we additionally cache some partial results and reuse them at the remaining steps.	algorithm	Burçin Eröcal;Oleksandr Motsak;Frank-Olaf Schreyer;Andreas Steenpaß	2016	J.

Computer explorations by Haiman have revealed that DH n has a number of remarkable combinatorial properties. In particular DH n is an S n module whose conjectured representation, graded by degree in y, is a sign twisted version of the action of S n on the parking function module. This conjecture predicts the character of each of the y-homogeneous subspaces Y j of DH n. The space Y 0 of diagonal harmonics with no y dependence is known in the classical theory. In this article we construct a basis for the subspace Y 1 of diagonal harmonics linear in y. Using this basis we prove that the Y 1 specialization of the Parking Function Conjecture is correct, and we provide a formula for the character of Y 1 graded by degree in x. This last formula matches the Y 1 specialization of a master conjecture of Garsia and Haiman which expresses the bigraded character of DH n .	diffie–hellman key exchange;partial template specialization;polynomial;twisted	Joseph Alfano	1998	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/S0012-365X(98)00131-9	combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;mathematics;n! conjecture;differential equation;algebra;satisfiability	Theory	43.6874265107024	34.30325931399554	194274

Recently, several authors have studied permutation trinomials of the form xh ( x ) over Fq2 , where q = 2 , h(x) = 1+x+x and r, s, t, k > 0 are integers. Their methods are essentially usage of a multiplicative version of AGW Criterion because they all transformed the problem of proving permutation polynomials over Fq2 into that of showing the corresponding fractional polynomials permute a smaller set μq+1, where μq+1 := {x ∈ Fq2 : x q+1 = 1}. Motivated by these results, we characterize the permutation polynomials of the form xh ( x ) over Fq2 such that h(x) ∈ Fq[x] is arbitrary and q is also an arbitrary prime power. Using AGW Criterion twice, one is multiplicative and the other is additive, we reduce the problem of proving permutation polynomials over Fq2 into that of showing permutations over a small subset S of a proper subfield Fq, which is significantly different from previously known methods. In particular, we demonstrate our method by constructing many new explicit classes of permutation polynomials of the form xh ( x ) over Fq2 . Moreover, we can explain most of the known permutation trinomials, which are in [6, 13, 14, 16, 20, 29], over finite field with even characteristic.

We determine the degree, arithmetic genus and defining prime ideal of the central curve, thereby answering a question of Bayer and Lagarias. These invariants, along with the degree of the Gauss image of the curve, are expressed in terms of the matroid of the input matrix. Extending work of Dedieu, Malajovich and Shub, this yields an instance-specific bound on the total curvature of the central path, a quantity relevant for interior point methods.

This can be compared with the previous much more restrictive estimate s ≥ n − 0.192 √ n/ logn and shows that the minimum m(K) over the relative normalised size of nonzero algebraic integers α in such a field K is equal to 1 which is attained at α = ±1. Stronger than previous but apparently not optimal bound for m(K) is also obtained for the fields K satisfying 0.639 ≤ s/n < 0.827469 . . . .

d289a4811f1557616adc1db7848f70935cea7048	a simple proof of a theorem of block and hart		Proof: It is clear that x0 is a periodic point of f and we assume that the period is r. Then k = rm for some positive integer m. If m = 1 or m = 2, then there is nothing to prove. So we assume m u003e 3. Let g =f2 and gn = 2r. Then x0 is a fixed point of g and xn is a periodic point of gn of period m* u003e 1. In fact, m* = m if m is odd, or m* = m/2 if m is even. Clearly gu0027(x0)= [(f)u0027(x)]2 2 0. If gu0027(x0) = 1, then it follows from the Cu0027convergence of gn to g that for sufficiently large n, gm* has only one fixed point near x0. On the other hand, since m* u003e 1, Xn and gn(Xn) are two distinct fixed points of g*n with xn x0 and gn(Xn) -u003e x0, a contradiction. If g u0027(x0) = 1, then there exists an interval V containing x0 such that for n sufficiently large gu0027(x) u003e 0 on V and {xn, gn(xn), , gn* (x )} c V.

The most unexpected result is that this noncommutative problem of factoring partial differential operators can be approached effectively by reducing it to the problem of solving systems of polynomial equations over a commutative ring. In the case where a given polynomial is Zn-graded, we can reduce the problem completely to factoring an element in a commutative multivariate polynomial ring.  The implementation in Singular is effective on a broad range of polynomials and increases the ability of computer algebra systems to address this important problem.

A geometric resolution consists of a primitive element of the algebraic extension defined by the set of roots, its minimal polynomial, and the parametrizations of the coordinates. Such a representation of the solutions has a long history which goes back to Leopold Kronecker and has been revisited many times in computer algebra. We introduce a new generation of probabilistic algorithms where all the computations use only univariate or bivariate polynomials. We give a new codification of the set of solutions of a positive dimensional algebraic variety relying on a new global version of Newton's iterator. Roughly speaking the complexity of our algorithm is polynomial in some kind of degree of the system, in its height, and linear in the complexity of evaluation of the system. We present our implementation in the Magma system which is called Kronecker in homage to his method for solving systems of polynomial equations. We show that the theoretical complexity of our algorithm is well reflected in practice and we exhibit some cases for which our program is more efficient than the other available software. 2001 Academic Press	algebraic equation;bivariate data;coefficient;iterator;magma;minimal polynomial (field theory);newton;randomized algorithm;symbolic computation;system of polynomial equations	Marc Giusti;Grégoire Lecerf;Bruno Salvy	2001	J.

The algorithms designed for these problems make decisions based on signs of geometric predicates or on the roots of polynomials characterizing the problem. The reliability of the algorithm depends on the accurate evaluation of these signs and roots. In this paper, we present a {\em naive precision-driven computational model} to perform these computations reliably and demonstrate its effectiveness on a certain class of problems like sign of determinants with rational entries, boundary evaluation and curve arrangements. We also present a novel algorithm to compute all the roots of a univariate polynomial to any desired accuracy. The computational model along with the underlying number representation, precision-driven arithmetic and all the algorithms are implemented as part of a stand-alone software library, PRECISE.	algorithm;apache axis;arbitrary-precision arithmetic;computation;computational geometry;computational model;library (computing);linear algebra;medial graph;nonlinear system;polynomial;predicate (mathematical logic);voronoi diagram	Shankar Krishnan;Mark Foskey;Tim Culver;John Keyser;Dinesh Manocha	2001		10.1145/378583.378693	algorithm design;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;voronoi diagram;medial axis;floating point;propagation of uncertainty;linear algebra;convex hull;minkowski addition;mathematics;geometry;algebraic curve;algebraic function;algorithm	Theory	50.95529960164398	33.396665797034565	197314

c3765d8cdad080236246c9e8b13813533bdee900	the fundamental theorem of algebra via the fourier inversion formula		The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, or “FTA,” has a rich, centuries-old history [6]. The numerous proofs that can be found demonstrate the importance and continuing interest. Let the number of proofs be N (we can verify N u003e 80). We provide proofs N + 1 through N + 4 using the Fourier transform and its inversion formula, or “FIF.” A few reasons for so many proofs are: to have a proof by the most elementary means, a proof suitable for a class in math, and a proof by subject area. The FTA is a wellknown consequence of Liouville’s theorem, see [1, p. 122], a topic in complex variable math courses. This note is completed by showing FIF implies Liouville’s theorem. Our proofs of the FTA, that is, P(z) = 0 has a solution for any nonconstant polynomial P with complex coefficients, are suitable for a beginning course in Fourier transforms. Please see [3], [7], and [4] for basic results and an overview of the history of Fourier analysis. We shall use the following form of the Fourier transform and inversion formula, the proof of which is contained in the discussion found in [3, pp. 214–219]. Theorem 1 (FIF).

There are four main results: the first concerns the approximation of the inv rse of a Toeplitz operator by the inverses of its finite truncations. The second c oncerns a new proof of the ‘hard’ part of Baxter’s theorem, and the third concern s the Born approximation for a scattering problem on the lattice Z+ . The fourth and final result concerns a basic proposition of Golinskii-Ibragimov arisi ng n their analysis of the Strong Szegö Limit Theorem. 0. INTRODUCTION. Let dμ be a probability measure on the unit circle Γ = {z ∈ C : |z| = 1} and letΦn = z + ... , n ≥ 0, be the (monic) orthogonal polynomials (OPUC’s) associated withdμ, ∫ Γ Φm(z)Φn(z)dμ = 0, m 6= n, m,n ≥ 0 (see [20]). Let α = (αn)n∈Z+ denote the vector of Verblunsky coefficients αn = −Φn+1(0), n ≥ 0. By Verblunsky’s theorem (see [17]), the map V : dμ 7→ α is a bijection from the probability measures on Γ onto×j=0 D, whereD = {z ∈ C : |z| < 1} is the (open) unit disc inC. Following Cantero, Moral and Velázquez [6], we may, given α, construct a (pentadiagonal) unitary matrix operator U = U(α) in l+ = l (Z+) (the so-called CMV matrix) with the following property: e0 = (1, 0, ...) is a cyclic vector forU, i.e. < Uk e0 >−∞<k<∞ = l 2 +, and the associated spectral measure forU is preciselydμ = V(α). With this construction, Verblunsky’s theorem becomes a result in spectral/inverse spectral theo ry: Indeed, letS denote the map from CMV matrices U to their spectral measures dμ on Γ , (0.1) U 7−→ dμ and letI denote the map from measures dμ onΓ to their associated CMV matrices U = U(V(dμ)), (0.2) dμ 7−→ U(V(dμ)). ThenS andI are inverse to each other. The above correspondence, which i s the analog for the unit circle of the well-known correspondence between measures on the line and Jacobi operators (see e.g. [8]), divides the stu dy of OPUC’s naturally 1 2 P. DEIFT, J.ÖSTENSSON into two parts: thedirect problem(equivalently, the study of the properties of S) and theinverse problem(equivalently, the study of the properties of I). This is the approach taken in Simon’s new book [17, 18]: Part 1 focuse s onI and Part 2 focuses onS. The goal of the present paper is to show that the study of the m apI is greatly facilitated by using Riemann-Hilbert (RH) techn iques. We will do this by producing new and transparent RH proofs of some classical an d ce tral theorems in the subject: En route, we will also derive some new results . Denote byH± the closed subspaces of L (Γ) consisting of functionsu whose negative/non-negative Fourier coeffients are zero, and let P± : L (Γ) → H± be the associated orthogonal projections. Given a function φ ∈ L∞ (Γ) we define the associatedToeplitz operator with symbol φ, T (φ) : H+ → H+, by the formula (0.3) T(φ)u = P+(φu), u ∈ H+. In terms of the Fourier coefficients φk = φ̂ (k) = ∫π −π e−ikθφ(eiθ) 2π the Toeplitz operator becomes a truncated discrete convolutio n:	approximation;baxter (robot);coefficient;h+: the digital series;jacobi method;monic polynomial;stellar classification;toeplitz hash algorithm;truncation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Percy Deift;Jörgen Östensson	2006	Journal of Approximation Theory	10.1016/j.jat.2005.08.001	functional analysis;spectral theory;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;toeplitz matrix;mathematics;orthogonal polynomials;algebra	Theory	45.18232010719985	34.2698559851176	198373

1e34d6d0fddba8f3c09950cec9c3574b9c6bd7bf	using the regular chains library to build cylindrical algebraic decompositions by projecting and lifting		Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) is an important tool, both for quantifier elimination over the reals and a range of other applications. Traditionally, a CAD is built through a process of projection and lifting to move the problem within Euclidean spaces of changing dimension. Recently, an alternative approach which first decomposes complex space using triangular decomposition before refining to real space has been introduced and implemented within the RegularChains Library of Maple. We here describe a freely available package ProjectionCAD which utilises the routines within the RegularChains Library to build CADs by projection and lifting. We detail how the projection and lifting algorithms were modified to allow this, discuss the motivation and survey the functionality of the package.	algebraic equation;algorithm;computer-aided design;lambda lifting;lifting scheme;maple;quantifier (logic);regularchains;triangular decomposition	Matthew England;David J.

Matrix embedding is a well-known steganographic scheme that can improve the embedding efficiency. However, the embedding cost (running time) is expensive when employing high dimensional matrix, while higher dimensional matrix usually provides better embedding efficiency. In this paper, we construct a specific matrix for matrix embedding, in which data embedding procedure can be implemented with linear computational complexity. The novel scheme is computationally efficient, and meanwhile it leads to a relatively good embedding efficiency.	algorithmic efficiency;computational complexity theory;embedded system;steganography;time complexity	Yunkai Gao;Xiaolong Li;Bin Yang	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo	10.1109/ICME.2009.5202667	hamming weight;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;information security;theoretical computer science;linear code;mathematics;semidefinite embedding;steganography;information hiding;computational complexity theory;pixel;statistics	DB	40.55438313712815	44.75274719699517	198837

The main emphasis lies on transformations T induced by bijective changes  of the presentation. Several sufficient conditions are given for very complex functions f such that T –1 (f) is simple for an appropriate . On the other hand there are intrinsicially difficult functions that cannot be transformed into simple functions by any T. Usually several functions shall be transformed simultaneously into simple functions. The following result gives a strong limitation of the power of data change: If T is such that any primitive recursive (p.r.) f remains p.r., then no not p.r. function can be transformed into a p.r. function.	computation	Rutger Verbeek;Klaus Weihrauch	1976		10.1007/3-540-07854-1_228	computational problem;complexity;computational topology;decision tree model;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;computational resource;generic point;mathematics;computational complexity theory;computational learning theory;computational model;asymptotic computational complexity;algorithm;descriptive complexity theory	HPC	43.09534170407703	34.488735662805105	198888
