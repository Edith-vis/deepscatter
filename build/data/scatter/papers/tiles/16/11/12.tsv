This procedure works for certain nonlinear codes as well, and we apply it in this paper to the development of several decoding algorithms for the extended Nordstrom-Robinson code used in conjunction with both BPSK and QPSK modulations. The small operation counts and the highly regular structures of many of these algorithms make them particularly well-suited to VLSI implementation. We describe one such implementation in this paper.	algorithm;decoding methods	Ayyoob D. Abbaszadeh;Craig K.

Two classes of algorithms are considered: 1) algorithms that estimate spatially matched filter solutions and 2) adaptive techniques for suppressing interference. In the simulations that were conducted, the “matched filter” algorithms provide more consistent performance than the “adaptive” algorithms, and required less computation. This is due to the fact that CDMA interference is comprised of a large number of small interference contributions from throughout the cell.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;computation;interference (communication);matched filter;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation	John S.

In this letter, first, the authors propose a two-dimensional (2D) LOS/NLOS classification scheme that uses skewness of the channel impulse/pulse response, which has not been used by existing work. The log-likelihood ratio of the 2D LOS/NLOS classification is used to determine the weights for localisation. Then, the authors derive an iterative Gauss–Newton method to solve the location of the target, which provides a higher accuracy than the Gauss–Newton method used in existing work. Finally, they investigate improved localisation by incorporating the statistics of NLOS bias as a result of LOS/NLOS classification into the cost function, and derive the statistics of the corresponding errors of location estimates. The proposed 2D LOS/NLOS classification scheme is compared with an existing 3D scheme to demonstrate its effectiveness.	cellular automaton;comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;gauss–newton algorithm;iterative method;language localisation;line-of-sight (missile);loss function;newton;newton's method;software propagation;ultra-wideband	Arash Abbasi;Huaping Liu	2014	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2013.0438	speech recognition;telecommunications;mathematics;newton's method	ML	52.89151856409469	73.77311383466976	51450

The distribution of the decision statistics associated with the LRT and GLRT is studied. This allows us to give exact closed-form expressions of the probability of detection (PD) and false alarm (PFA) for two LRT-based receivers. Then, asymptotic (with respect to the data length) closed-form expressions are given for PD and PFA for four GLRT-based receivers.

Due to their symbol structure, they can have a representation close to that of an STBC. RS codes are admittedly more complex to decode as they have no orthogonal properties. However, they offer much higher coding rates. In addition, a wide range of these codes can be easily generated. To decode them, we have developed a new algorithm using a sliding encoding-window (SEW), which is combined with the decoding-based Chase algorithm. We compare the RS(15,7) code to the Alamouti one, both having an equivalent coding rate. Its performance compared to Alamouti gets better as the receive diversity increases. Moreover, RS codes do not require the channel to remain constant over the code duration. In fact, they offer better results if the channel changes rapidly, which can be obtained virtually by introducing interleaving	algorithm;coding theory;folded reed–solomon code;forward error correction;reed–solomon error correction;window function	Massinissa Lalam;Karine Amis;Dominique Leroux	2005	2005 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2005.1651393	block code;concatenated error correction code;real-time computing;space–time block code;telecommunications;computer science;linear code;mathematics;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;statistics	Arch	42.58639311500424	69.62931344268574	51911

But if the MCM signal is only simply operated by inverse companding transform at the receiver, the resultant spectrum may exhibit severe in-band and out-of-band radiation of the distortion components, and considerable peak regrowth by excessive channel noises etc. In order to prevent these problems from occurring, in this paper, two novel nonlinear companding schemes with a iterative receiver are proposed to reduce the PAPR. By transforming the amplitude or power of the original MCM signals into uniform distributed signals, the novel schemes can effectively reduce PAPR for different modulation formats and sub-carrier sizes. Despite moderate complexity increasing at the receiver, but it is especially suitable to be combined with iterative channel estimation. Computer simulation results show that the proposed schemes can offer good system performances without any bandwidth expansion.	bandwidth expansion;channel state information;companding;computer simulation;distortion;iteration;iterative method;modulation;multi-chip module;nonlinear system;out-of-band agreement;performance;power architecture platform reference;resultant;subcarrier;x.690	Tao Jiang;Wenbing Yao;Peng Guo;Yong-Hua Song;Daiming Qu	2006	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2006.872992	computer simulation;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;companding;signal processing;mathematics;iterative method	Mobile	52.219096155842706	72.80169494257879	52190

Two Gray-mapped quadrature-amplitude modulations are employed within a codeword so that the transmission rates of the proposed AMC can be controlled even though the rate of the employed LDPC code is fixed. The rate and degree distribution of the employed LDPC code are selected properly for the proposed scheme. We also optimize the bit-to-symbol mapping for the LDPC code over irregular modulation at each transmission rate. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared with that of the AMC scheme with a dedicated LDPC code at each transmission rate. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme has a performance comparable to that of the AMC scheme with dedicated LDPC codes.	advanced mezzanine card;code word;codec;degree distribution;differential evolution;encoder;loss function;low-density parity-check code;modulation;qr code	Seok-Ki Ahn;Kyeongcheol Yang	2010	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2010.080310.090176	computer simulation;electronic engineering;low-density parity-check code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	44.68327740877327	68.97067215126971	52320

This letter presents a new FEC scheme based on multiple-symbol interleaved Reed-Solomon codes and an associated two-pass decoding algorithm. It is shown that the proposed multi-symbol interleaved Reed-Solomon scheme can achieve nearly twice as much as the burst error correction capability of conventional single-symbol interleaved Reed-Solomon codes with the same code length and code rate.	algorithm;burst error;burst noise;code rate;error detection and correction;folded reed–solomon code;forward error correction;reed–solomon error correction	Zengfu Wang;Andrea Chini;M.

However, when the delay spread of the MIMO channel is too large there is significant performance degradation and there is a need for equalization. In this paper we use MLSE structures that decode the space-time codes and equalize the channel in one structure. The resulting complexity of MLSE is therefore increased and it is necessary to took at ways to minimize this. Here we compare the Forney and Ungerboeck forms and we find that the Ungerboeck form is more attractive. In particular its complexity does not depend on the number of receive antennas.	equalization (communications);maximum likelihood sequence estimation	J. Ho-Yin Fan;Wai Ho Mow;Ross D.

In this paper, low-complexity and compressive-sensing (CS)-based detectors for GSM systems are proposed. First, an extension of the normalized CS detector (E-NCS) based on the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is proposed, which is shown to be suitable for large-scale GSM implementations, due to its low complexity. Furthermore, to mitigate the error floor effect of the E-NCS detector, two efficient CS (ECS) detectors based on the OMP algorithm are designed with the aid of a preset threshold. Specifically, different searching algorithms are designed, whose objective is to balance computational complexity and system performance. An upper bound for the average bit error probability (ABEP) of the first ECS detector is derived and used to optimize the preset threshold. Simulation results show that the proposed ECS detectors are capable of achieving a considerable reduction in computational complexity, compared with other near-optimal algorithms, with a negligible performance loss.	bit error rate;compressed sensing;computation;computational complexity theory;dispersive partial differential equation;error floor;horseland;mimo;matching pursuit;modulation;network computing system;openmp;outside broadcasting;radio frequency;search algorithm;sensor;simulation;sparse matrix;transmitter	Lixia Xiao;Ping Yang;Yue Xiao;Shiwen Fan;Marco Di Renzo;Wei Xiang;Shaoqian Li	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2558205	gsm;detector;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;theoretical computer science;antenna;demodulation;radio frequency;mimo	Vision	46.42331295374364	74.51251859525905	52889

Specific constructions are considered for 4-level modulation schemes with full response and weak partial response-heuristic design rules are used for defining the subsets of codes within which an exhaustive search is conducted. The coding gains of the best codes within these subsets are better than those of best previously known multi-memory codes. >	additive white gaussian noise;code;modulation	Sliraga I.

The hybrid-decision scheme is a decoding scheme used that combines two iterative decoding algorithms for decoding LDPC codes. This scheme is suitable for many applications such as audio and video transmission that are sensitive to time. The hybrid-decision scheme mixes between the characteristics of the soft-decision decoding scheme and the harddecision decoding scheme to reduce the computational complexity of the whole decoding algorithm. The modification proposed in this paper is applied to the implementation-efficient reliability ratio weighted bit-flipping (IERRWBF) algorithm which represents hard-decision scheme in the hybrid algorithm. This modification is capable of achieving better performance than that of the hybrid decoding algorithm with reducing the number of iterations required at each SNR and approaching more to the performance of the SPA. This reduction is more observable as the maximum number of iterations assigned for the algorithm increases or as the code length increases with improving the error performance as proved by simulation results.

It is well-known that the diversity gain of the SVD scheme is limited by the subchannel gain with the smallest singular value. The SVD scheme can be combined with error correcting codes to compensate for the performance loss due to the smallest subchannel gain. In this paper, we provide the analysis of the diversity order for coded SVD schemes with arbitrary system configurations. When utilizing channel coding of code rate Rc for systems which transmit N streams with Nt transmit and Nr receive antennas, the maximum diversity order of the coded SVD schemes is derived as (Nt - lceilN . Rcrceil +1)(Nr - lceilN . Rcrceil +1). This analysis result shows that there is a tradeoff of the code rate and the diversity order in the coded SVD scheme and provides an insight for code design.	channel capacity;channel state information;code rate;digital subchannel;error detection and correction;forward error correction;like button;mimo;simulation;singular value decomposition;spatial multiplexing	Kyoung-Jae Lee;Inkyu Lee	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.881	transmitter;error detection and correction;channel code;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics;channel state information;singular value decomposition;singular value;spatial multiplexing;multiplexing;statistics;diversity gain;mimo	Mobile	41.51049190678966	72.72584938372535	54347

In this paper, we investigate a synchronization signal structure and corresponding cell search algorithm in the LTE system where two, primary and secondary synchronization signals are employed. We focus on the secondary synchronization signal which possesses two layered scrambling sequences in addition to basic sequences. These scrambling sequences minimize performance degradation in cell search, but incur a high complexity to a mobile station receiver. In this paper, we propose a new secondary synchronization signal structure which does not require additional scrambling sequences while maintaining almost the same performance as the current LTE scheme. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme under various channel environments by examining the impacts of multipath fading, frequency offset, and vehicular speed. We also compare the complexity of the proposed scheme with the LTE scheme.	analog television;collision problem;compaq lte;computer simulation;elegant degradation;frequency offset;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;idle (cpu);modem;multipath propagation;performance;search algorithm;telecommunications link	Il Gyu Kim;Youngnam Han;Hyun Chung	2010	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2010.01.090516	synchronization;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	48.87155986277525	71.99445529646863	54762

We firstly extend the modified protograph extrinsic information transfer (PEXIT) algorithm in order to analyze the convergence performance of protograph codes. Based on the extended PEXIT algorithm and Gaussian approximation, we further derive the asymptotic bit-error-rate (BER) expression of protograph codes. Utilizing the PEXIT algorithm, theoretical and simulated BERs, we compare the performance of two classical protograph codes, i.e., accumulate-repeat-by-3-accumulate (AR3A) code and accumulate-repeat-by-4-jagged-accumulate (AR4JA) code, regular LDPC code, and optimized irregular LDPC codes, and illustrate that the AR3A code is superior to other three codes. Additionally, we discuss the impact of the number of receive antennas (i.e., NR) on the system performance and verify that the theoretical analyses hold as NR varies. As a result, the AR3A code stands out as a good candidate for wireless communication applications with multiple antennas.	algorithm;approximation;approximation algorithm;asymptote;big data;bit error rate;block code;concatenation;ibm notes;low-density parity-check code;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;mathematical optimization;noise reduction;portable document format;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;soft-in soft-out decoder;x.690	Yi Fang;Guojun Han;Pingping Chen;Yong Liang Guan;Guoan Bi	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343282	block code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;low-density parity-check code;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;linear code;mathematics;error floor;fading;wireless;statistics;mimo	Arch	43.64682784114269	70.34036924092361	54819

Non-Gaussian noise is found in many wireless channels due to impulsive phenomena of radio-frequency interference. Bayesian inference of all unknown quantities is made from the blurred and noisy observations. The Gibbs sampler, a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure, is employed to calculate the Bayesian estimates. The basic idea is to generate ergodic random samples from the joint posterior distribution of all unknowns and then to average the appropriate samples to obtain the estimates of the unknown quantities. Blind Bayesian equalizers based on the Gibbs sampler are derived for both Gaussian ISI channel and impulsive ISI channel. A salient feature of the proposed blind Bayesian equalizers is that they can incorporate the a priori symbol probabilities, and they produce as output the a posteriorisymbol probabilities. (That is, they are “soft-input soft-output” algorithms.) Hence, these methods are well suited for iterative processing in a coded system, which allows the blind Bayesian equalizer to refine its processing based on the information from the decoding stage and vice versa—a receiver structure termed asblind turbo equalizer .	algorithm;bayesian approaches to brain function;catastrophic interference;circuit restoration;equalization (communications);ergodicity;estimation theory;gibbs sampling;information sciences institute;interference (communication);iterative method;markov chain monte carlo;monte carlo method;radio frequency;sampling (signal processing);turbo equalizer;utility functions on indivisible goods;white noise	Xiaodong Wang;Rong Chen	2001	IEEE Trans.

Specifically, we examine two schemes: automatic repeat request (ARQ), and hybrid ARQ (i.e. ARQ combined with forward error correction (FEC) capability). We focus on Reed-Solomon (RS) FEC codes (in hybrid ARQ) and propose a new model, incorporating different block sizes as well as code error-correction capability, to estimate the energy consumption for performing encoding and decoding operations in optical networks. The model considers the impact of varying pre-FEC bit-error rates (BER) of the optical channel, and the signal processing blocks used to implement RS codes. Our results show that when the pre-FEC channel BER is in excess of 10-5, hybrid ARQ offers better performance than ARQ in terms of energy efficiency. However, both hybrid ARQ and ARQ have similar performance under lower BER.	burst error;code;code word;error detection and correction;fibre channel;forward error correction;hybrid automatic repeat request;internet;offset binary;reed–solomon error correction;reliable messaging;signal processing;x.690	Kyle Guan;Bipin Sankar Gopalakrishna Pillai;Arun Vishwanath;Daniel C.

This proposal was verified in the context of a MIMO receiver, the effects of finite-length arithmetic and limited precision are evaluated in terms of their impact on the receiver bit error rate (BER). We will define the minimum fixed-point word size required not to adversely impact performance for nt transmit antennas and nR receive antennas. Our analysis of MIMO receiver under these conditions shows a strong robustness on the numerical precision, which allows to have a receiver performance very close to that obtained with floating point arithmetic in terms of BER, therefore we believe this scheme is attractive candidate for its implementation in current communications standards.	bit error rate;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point arithmetic;mimo;mimo-ofdm;numerical analysis;qr algorithm;qr decomposition;scalability;x.690	Jorge Robles;Joaquín Cortez;Eduardo Romero;Erica Ruiz	2017	2017 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium (WTS)	10.1109/WTS.2017.7943551	mimo;computer science;bit error rate;real-time computing;givens rotation;qr decomposition;fixed-point arithmetic;floating point;space–time block code;fixed point	Networks	44.431306480281684	67.46381421109177	56492

Without any other reliable network infrastructure, GSM can be applied for tele-monitoring applications, where high mobility and low cost are necessary. A core objective of this paper is to introduce the design of a more reliable and dependable Medical Network Channel Code system (MNCC) through GSM Network. MNCC design based on simple concatenated channel code, which is cascade of an inner code (GSM) and an extra outer code (Convolution Code) in order to protect medical data more robust against channel errors than other data using the existing GSM network. In this paper, the MNCC system will provide Bit Error Rate (BER) equivalent to the BER for medical tele monitoring of physiological signals, which is 10-5 or less [1].

The decoding is performed by a decision feedback equalizer and provides soft output which allows a concatenation of the lattice codes with other type of error-correcting codes. The problem of selecting a good rotation is also considered, and we show that a high dimensional random rotation exhibits very good performance on a Rayleigh fading channel.	algorithm;bibliothèque de l'école des chartes;code;concatenation;equalization (communications);error detection and correction;forward error correction;rayleigh fading	Catherine Lamy;Joseph Jean Boutros	1998	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/BF02998501	equalization;telecommunications;density;rotation;rayleigh fading;mean squared error;coding;physics;statistics	ML	43.096527574885094	71.84468188565641	56819
920033395dbe208ad02e6cb7543b895bea1a7d5f	low power bch decoder using early termination scheme for wban standard		This paper presents a (63, 51) BCH decoder for the IEEE 802.15.6 wireless body area network (WBAN) standard. WBAN is applied to medical and non-medical devices that require short-range communications for human body. To reduce power consumption, the proposed BCH decoder uses an early termination scheme for the syndrome computation and Chien search, which can correct errors earlier. The proposed (63, 51) BCH decoder is implemented using the Samsung 65-nm CMOS standard cell library. Implementation results show that power consumption decreased to 45.86% compared to the case without the ET scheme at SNR = 7 dB.	bch code;cmos;chien search;computation;signal-to-noise ratio;standard cell	Seo Lin Jeong;Myung Hoon Sunwoo	2017	2017 International SoC Design Conference (ISOCC)	10.1109/ISOCC.2017.8368884	chien search;real-time computing;wireless;computer science;decoding methods;computation;standard cell;bch code;body area network;cmos	EDA	45.24588417818354	64.91260821731598	56863

The first adaptive algorithm, referred to as the nonlinear least bit error, is a stochastic approximation to the Parzen window estimation of the detector output's probability density function while the second algorithm is based on a clustering. The proposed adaptive solutions are capable of providing a signal to noise ratio gain in excess of 8 dB against the theoretical linear minimum bit error rate benchmarker, when supporting four users with the aid of two receive antennas or five users employing three antenna elements.	adaptive algorithm;beamforming;bit error rate;cluster analysis;kernel density estimation;nonlinear system;offset binary;radial (radio);radial basis function network;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;stochastic approximation;symmetric multiprocessing	Sheng Chen;Khaled Labib;Rong Kang;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.493	stochastic approximation;mathematical optimization;radial basis function;probability density function;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics;approximation theory	Robotics	48.550867609448694	74.40003355956577	57523

These schemes combine the bandwidth efficiency of coded modulation with power efficiency of forward error control to provide a high efficient transmission. Simulations are carried out over the wireless channels. Both throughput and reliability are found to be improved by employing the HARQ schemes based on the multilevel coded modulation instead of the conventional trellis coded modulation. Simulation and performance analysis on code combining in multilevel HARQ is also presented. Code combining in the different multilevel HARQ schemes is found to influence the multistage decoding differently. Suggestion on scheme choosing for various requirements is presented at the end.	error detection and correction;hybrid automatic repeat request;modulation;multistage amplifier;performance per watt;requirement;simulation;spectral efficiency;throughput;trellis quantization	Qinglin Luo;Peter Sweeney	2004	2004 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (IEEE Cat.

The algorithm is applicable to a non-linear array where the number of signals could be greater than the number of antennas. It does not require a prior knowledge of the direction of arrivals (DOAs) of the signals of any user but requires the code sequence of a reference user. The proposed algorithm provides us with estimates of the DOAs, the multi-path impulse response of the reference signal source, and the calibration of the antenna gain and phase, even under a multiple access interference. We verify the algorithm by using synthetic data as well as field data measured through a custom-built W-CDMA test bed.	algorithm	Chong Hyun Lee;Joohwan Chun	2002	Signal Processing	10.1016/S0165-1684(02)00248-7	code division multiple access;electronic engineering;calibration;telecommunications;impulse response;computer science;electrical engineering;asynchronous communication;mathematics;iterative method;antenna gain;estimation theory;direction of arrival;antenna array;synthetic data;testbed	EDA	51.01985741138027	72.46290137982616	57938

4d885862941d3f8fd0e161d67d17f801c525880a	a new progressive algebraic soft decoding algorithm for reed-solomon codes	error correction capability progressive algebraic soft decoding reed solomon codes pasd progressively enlarged decoding parameter complexity reduction interpolation coordinate transform ict iterative polynomial construction;reed solomon codes algebraic codes computational complexity decoding error correction codes interpolation iterative methods polynomials;reed solomon codes algebraic soft decoding decoding complexity progressive decoding;polynomials interpolation decoding complexity theory variable speed drives memory management iterative decoding	The progressive algebraic soft decoding (PASD) algorithm can leverage the average complexity for algebraic soft decoding (ASD) of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. With a progressively enlarged decoding parameter that is the designed factorization output list size (OLS), it adapts the expensive interpolation computation to the quality of the received information and makes the average complexity of multiple decoding events channel dependent. However, the complexity reduction is realized at the expense of system memory since the intermediate interpolation information needs to be stored. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes a new PASD algorithm that can significantly reduce the memory requirement through the establishment of a condition on expanding the interpolated polynomial group without using the intermediate information. It has also embraced the interpolation coordinate transform (ICT) that alleviates the iterative polynomial construction task, resulting in the new proposal less computationally expensive than its predecessor, the PASD algorithm. Our numerical analysis shows that its memory requirement will be at most half of that of the PASD algorithm and it is less complex than various ASD algorithms, while the error-correction capability of ASD is preserved.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;code;computation;error detection and correction;information needs;interpolation;iterative method;numerical analysis;ordinary least squares;polynomial;reduction (complexity);reed–solomon error correction	Yi Lyu;Ling Chen	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2014.6875143	list decoding;concatenated error correction code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;sequential decoding;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;mathematics;berlekamp–welch algorithm;error floor;reed–solomon error correction	Theory	43.50350760406654	60.54932856519861	58267

Specifically, the asymptotic pairwise error probability is derived for imperfect channel state information (CSI) and of the minimum mean squared-error (MMSE) detector. The analysis is then used to evaluate the impact of two different training schemes. It is shown that inserting training symbols before precoder is a better option than multiplexing training symbols with data symbols after the precoder.

We divide the channel code into two levels, the upper code interacting with the shaping code and the lower code that does not such that it is information lossless. Our code design is more intuitive for designing DPC in the high SNR regime. The design of the lower code becomes trivial since it does not interact with the shaping code anymore. The design of the upper code is also simplified since we can now assume binary signaling for the code. We evaluate the capacity of each level and design codes to approach the estimated capacity. We demonstrate a good performance can indeed be achieved by simulations using low- density parity-check (LDPC) codes at each level. Our best code is only 0.45 dB from the no-interference Gaussian capacity at the spectral efficiency of 3 b/s/Hz.	channel capacity;deferred procedure call;interaction;interference (communication);lossless compression;low-density parity-check code;noise shaping;shaping codes;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency	Sae-Young Chung	2008	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2008.080278	systematic code;concatenated error correction code;prefix code;constant-weight code;low-density parity-check code;universal code;telecommunications;hamming bound;variable-length code;computer science;theoretical computer science;repetition code;cyclic code;code rate;linear code;mathematics;locally testable code;statistics	Arch	43.889028083840415	71.9439062900109	58464

Closest-point searches in lattices can be performed as nonbinary belief propagation on associated TGs; soft-information output is naturally generated in the process; the algorithm requires no backtrack (cf. classic sphere decoding), and extracts extrinsic information. A lattice's coding gain enables equivalence relations between lattice points, which can be thereby partitioned in cosets. Total and extrinsic a posteriori probabilities at the detector's output further enable the use of soft detection information in iterative schemes. The algorithm is illustrated via two scenarios that transmit a 32-point, uncoded super-orthogonal (SO) constellation for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, carved from an 8-dimensional nonorthogonal lattice D4⊕D4: it achieves maximum likelihood performance in quasistatic fading; and, performs close to interference-free transmission, and identically to list sphere decoding, in independent fading with coordinate interleaving and iterative equalization and detection. Latter scenario outperforms former despite absence of forward error correction coding-because the inherent lattice coding gain allows for the refining of extrinsic information. The lattice constellation is the same as the one employed in the SO space-time trellis codes first introduced for 2 × 2 MIMO by Ionescu et al., then independently by Jafarkhani and Seshadri. Algorithmic complexity is log-linear in lattice dimensionality versus cubic in classic sphere decoders.	algorithm;backtracking;belief propagation;coding gain;computational complexity theory;convolutional code;cubic function;error detection and correction;forward error correction;interference (communication);iterative method;log-linear model;mimo;soft-in soft-out decoder;software propagation;tanner graph;trellis quantization;turing completeness	Dumitru Mihai Ionescu;Haidong Zhu	2012	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2011.2178130	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;data structure;information theory;graph theory;theoretical computer science;lattice;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Vision	44.034400296158324	70.31044273418655	58649

Due to different path loss and shadowing from each transmitting station, the receiver experiences different long-term average signal powers from each transmitter. We first propose to use a tail-biting trellis to improve the performance of the vector quantization proposed in [2]. To reduce decoding complexity, we present a trellis labeling technique where efficient encoding and decoding can be performed by traversing the trellis twice. Lastly, we introduce a mechanism for dynamically allocating quantization bits amongst different parts of the augmented channel state vector. A trellis simplification procedure that keeps the number of trellis states at each stage to four is shown to provide a satisfactory performance.	beamforming;channel state information;level of detail;relay;transmitter;trellis quantization;vector quantization	Chun Kin Au-Yeung;Shahab Sanayei	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5496042	quantization;trellis quantization;telecommunications;space–time trellis code;computer science;path loss;base station;theoretical computer science;mathematics;channel state information;encoding;statistics	Robotics	43.50939146692906	69.8905203461496	58695

In this paper, we analyze the multiple access interference (MAI) performance of interleavers and propose a new design method for interleavers with lower complexity and less memory consumption: shifting interleavers. A series of interleavers can be generated by circular shifting a specific pseudo noise (PN) interleaver, which is generated by a PN sequence generator. Thus, the architecture of the proposed interleaver is much simpler than that of other interleaver schemes for IDMA systems. The simulation results show that shifting interleavers can achieve the same performance with much less resource consumption compared to random interleavers in the IDMA systems.	circular shift;forward error correction;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);pseudorandom number generator;simulation	Zhang Chenghai;Hu Jianhao	2007	Future Generation Communication and Networking (FGCN 2007)	10.1109/FGCN.2007.217	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science	EDA	47.809505414643716	69.26771903851458	58844

It is important to define exactly what is required in terms of phase noise within a particular system and to avoid expensive over-specification. Based on the analysis of allowable signal-to-noise ratio for phase reference and required phase error variance for M-ary PSK systems relative to a degradation loss objective, the general phase noise allocation method for M-ary PSK satellite communication systems has been proposed in this paper. The phase noise allocation using the proposed method is adopted for M-ary PSK multi-mode satellite communication systems. Using the oscillator phase noise model and the phase noise model of a frequency synthesizer, the required phase noise spectrum distributions are carried out and the validities of the allocated phase noise spectrums are verified by the system simulation.	communications satellite;phase noise	Young Wan Kim	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e88-b.3.1211	gaussian noise;spectrum;effective input noise temperature;noise spectral density;noise;degradation;frequency synthesizer;telecommunications;noise temperature;computer science;noise measurement;quantum noise;signal processing;noise;low-noise amplifier;noise;noise figure;oscillator phase noise;noise floor;signal-to-noise ratio;oscillation;phase noise;specification;communications satellite;carrier-to-receiver noise density;data transmission	Mobile	51.818737989374156	72.00928320503425	59292

We study this question in a situation where demodulation and pre-decoding of the incoming signal is performed independently at each antenna. The resulting bit stream is fed to a central processing unit, where bit error rate estimation and error correction are performed. It turns out that an increase in number of antennas from 1 to 2–5 unleashes completely new features of the antenna system. In this contribution, we provide the conceptual study of an algorithm that exploits these new features. It has the advantage of learning the channel statistics blindly-no pilot sequences are necessary in an idealized scenario.	algorithm;bit error rate;bitstream;central processing unit;channel state information;error detection and correction	Janis Noetzel;Christian Arendt	2016	2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)	10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7906015	electronic engineering;speech recognition;telecommunications;engineering;reconfigurable antenna;antenna noise temperature;smart antenna	Visualization	40.47900422051253	73.13254271344758	59490

Gallager's error exponent can be used to determine the required codeword length to achieve a prescribed error probability at a given rate below the channel capacity. We first provide new, analytical expressions for Gallager's exponent of STBC systems over η-μ fading channels. The Shannon capacity and cutoff rate, which can be directly derived from Gallager's exponent, are further examined. In order to get additional insights, a high signal-to-noise ratio analysis is pursued to investigate the effects of coherence time and codeword length on the error probability. For the sake of completeness, we provide the link to previous known results on Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading channels.	channel capacity;code word;error exponent;mimo;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-noise ratio	Jiayi Zhang;Michail Matthaiou;George K.

Although the results exposed herein are valid for any compound code built from both block and convolutional codes, we mainly focus on parallel turbo codes based on binary convolutional codes. The performance limit is found by evaluating the probability density function of the APP decoder output via a general propagation formula governing the density law through iterations. We propose also a second method to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio limit where the a priori density is assumed to be gaussian distributed. The results show that a gain in performance is achieved when bit nodes are combined into quaternary symbol nodes. For example, with a rate 1/2 Turbo code and a rate 2/3 binary RSC constituent, the minimal attainable signal-to-noise ratio per bit is 0:31 dB which is 0:13 dB away from the capacity of the AWGN channel with BPSK modulation.	additive white gaussian noise;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;convolutional code;iteration;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;turbo code	H.

The high sidelobes of the IDFT filter bank used can lead to spurious emissions (egress) in unauthorized frequency bands. Applying a window function within the DMT symbol can alleviate this. However, window functions either require additional redundancy or will introduce distortions that are generally not easy to compensate for. In this paper, a special class of window functions is constructed that corresponds to a precoding at the transmitter. These do not require any additional redundancy and need only a modest amount of additional processing at the receiver. The results can be used to increase the spectral containment of DMT-based wired communications such as ADSL and VDSL (i.e., asymmetric, resp., very-high-bitrate digital subscriber loop).	authorization;digital monetary trust;discrete fourier transform;distortion;egress filtering;equalization (communications);filter bank;frequency band;local loop;microsoft windows;transmitter;window function	Gert Cuypers;Koen Vanbleu;Geert Ysebaert;Marc Moonen	2006	EURASIP J.

The proposed algorithm consists of the following three steps: initialization, tree searching, and optimal selection. In the first step, the proposed detection scheme chooses several candidate symbols at the tree level of one. Based on these symbols, the MFA then finds the remaining transmitted symbols from the second tree level in the original tree structure. Finally, an optimal symbol sequence is decided among the most likely candidate sequences searched in the previous step.

This paper proposes a near-capacity MIMO bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) scheme for DTTB systems. The amplitude phase shift keying (APSK) constellation with Gray mapping is applied to the BICM scheme. From the perspective of average mutual information, APSK has the advantage of shaping gain compared to its quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) counterpart. Moreover, a new kind of bit interleaver named bit mapping, which takes into account the unequal error protection of both APSK and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, is proposed to further improve the system performance. The tool of extrinsic information transfer chart is utilized to help analyze and design the optimal bit mapping. Bit error rate simulations are carried out to verify the superiority of the proposed MIMO system.	bit error rate;forward error correction;key (cryptography);low-density parity-check code;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;mutual information;next-generation network;noise shaping;outline of television broadcasting;permutation pattern;simulation;spectral efficiency;terrestrial television;x.690	Tao Cheng;Kewu Peng;Fang Yang;Zhixing Yang	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2015.7127476	real-time computing;quadrature amplitude modulation;telecommunications;amplitude and phase-shift keying;mathematics	Mobile	43.27785198398606	69.95561975893311	60553

A suitable frequency error detector (FED) for large frequency offsets is the well-known balanced quadricorrelator. This FED is shown to produce great pattern jitter if it is to work with digital modulated MQAM and MPSK signals (M > 2) and random data. This paper describes how this pattern jitter for MQAM and MPSK signals can be overcome completely.

The model determines the amount of signal degradation caused by any noise environment that can be modeled as a Markov chain. The specific example of a Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) noise environment is discussed in detail. The model uses importance sampling to determine low bit error rates (BE&) for a wide range of noise environments. It is faster than a conventional simulation because the required run time is independent of the BER. It is more flexible than existing analytic models, as these make major assumptions, such as that symbol errors are independent (interleaving), or that all bursts have infinite power. The model increases the simulation efficiency by biasing the channel statistics so that more codeword errors occur and adjusts for this by using a weighting function whose value is calculated through the use of a Markov chain. The results show that using interleaving results in a significant performance improvement when the lengths of the interfering bursts are long relative to the data symbol length.	biasing;bit error rate;code word;elegant degradation;forward error correction;importance sampling;interference (communication);markov chain;noisy-channel coding theorem;radio frequency;run time (program lifecycle phase);sampling (signal processing);simulation;transmitter;viterbi decoder;weight function;x.690	Ted Berman;Jeffrey Freedman	1994	IEEE Trans.

Especially when distributed “slave” sensors (nodes) reach-back to communicate with the “master” sensor (gateway), low power cooperative schemes are well motivated. Viewing each node as an antenna element in a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) multi-antenna system, we design pilot patterns to estimate the multiple carrier frequency offsets (CFO), and the multiple channels corresponding to each node-gateway link. Our novel pilot scheme consists of non-zero pilot symbols along with zeros, which separate nodes in a time division multiple access (TDMA) fashion, and lead to low complexity schemes because CFO and channel estimators per node are decoupled. The resulting training algorithm is not only suitable for wireless sensor networks, but also for synchronization and channel estimation of single- and multi-carrier MIMO systems. We investigate the performance of our estimators analytically, and with simulations.	algorithm;carrier frequency;channel state information;mimo;sensor;simulation;software propagation;synchronization (computer science)	Mi-Kyung Oh;Xiaoli Ma;Georgios B.

We obtained a constellation that outperforms the 8-cross by 0.25 dB for a BICM mutual information of 2 bit/symbol. The optimized constellation for a low bit error rate requires a 0.4 dB lower SNR compared to the 8-cross for a BER of 10-3.	additive white gaussian noise;bit error rate;decibel;delta-sigma modulation;genetic algorithm;low-density parity-check code;mathematical optimization;mutual information;signal-to-noise ratio;utility functions on indivisible goods	Benjamin Müller;Bjom Zessack;Udo Zölzer	2014	2014 IEEE 15th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2014.6941465	electronic engineering;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;coding gain;mathematics	Mobile	44.35688717330618	71.07461868429144	62176

In the uncoded case, TRPC outperforms the conventional TR and non-coherent pulse position modulation (NC-PPM) signaling schemes. Moreover, it overcomes the implementation problem of the long delay line inherent in the conventional TR. Therefore, TRPC is a promising candidate for noncoherent UWB communication systems. Accordingly, coded TRPC has also been developed employing several forward error correction (FEC) codes, such as Reed-Solomon and convolutional codes. Based on these previous works, in this paper low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are introduced to the TRPC system and two methods are presented to construct the parity-check matrix for LDPC codes. We evaluate the bit error rate (BER) performance of the two corresponding LDPC codes in the IEEE 802.15.4a channels. Results show that both the two investigated LDPC codes obtain significant performance gains in terms of the BER over the existing FEC codes used in the TRPC system.	analog delay line;bit error rate;coherence (physics);computational complexity theory;convolutional code;delay line memory;error detection and correction;forward error correction;low-density parity-check code;message authentication code;modulation;parity-check matrix;qr code;r language;reed–solomon error correction;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;transistor;ultra-wideband;x.690;xfig	Junshan Zang;Zhonghua Liang;Jinjin Liu;Peipei Li;Xiaojun Yang	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343367	concatenated error correction code;turbo code;low-density parity-check code;error detection and correction;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;linear code;forward error correction;raptor code;error floor;encoding;statistics;computer network	Arch	43.7349318478292	67.6400777956265	62253

In the SWR context, parameterization is an approach to lessen the size of the software to be downloaded. This paper is dedicated to a reconfigurable linear feedback shift register based operator, which can carries out several front rank operations of multi mode CR transceivers. Focused on OFDM based Air Interfaces, the selected approach was to define a range of operations applying like-looking structures. In so doing, we point out a reconfigurable LFSR-based operator, which carries through pseudo random sequence generators, scrambling, convolutive coding, cyclic coding, Reed-Solomon Coding or Reed-Solomon decoding. We compare the implementation of such an operator with classical approaches.	cognitive radio;etsi satellite digital radio;keystone effect;linear-feedback shift register;mesh parameterization;pseudorandom number generator;pseudorandomness;reconfigurability;reed–solomon error correction;scheduling (computing);transceiver;vii	Laurent Alaus;Dominique Noguet;Jacques Palicot	2008	2008 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Pervasive Computing	10.1109/ISWPC.2008.4556222	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Arch	46.55163284411388	62.28676920244553	62357

In this paper, we propose a real-time VLSI implementation of this detection algorithm in the uplink system, where we have achieved both high performance in interference cancellation and computational efficiency. When interference cancellation converges, the difference of the detection vectors between two consecutive stages is mostly zero. Under the assumption of BPSK modulation, the differences between the bit estimates from consecutive stages are 0 and ±2. Bypassing the zero terms saves computations. Multiplication by ±2 can be easily implemented in hardware as arithmetic shifts. However, the convergence of the algorithm is dependent on the number of users, the interference and the signal to noise ratio and hence, the detection has a variable execution time. By using just two stages of the differencing detector, we achieve predictable execution time with performance equivalent to at least eight stages of the regular multistage detector. A VLSI implementation of the differencing multistage detector is built to demonstrate the computational savings and the real-time performance potential. The detector, handling up to eight users with 12-bit fixed point precision, was fabricated using a 1.2 μm CMOS technology and can process 190 Kbps/user for 8 users.	12-bit;algorithm;application-specific integrated circuit;autoregressive integrated moving average;cmos;computation;data rate units;fixed point (mathematics);interference (communication);iterative method;modulation;multistage amplifier;multistage interconnection networks;next-generation network;real-time clock;real-time computing;run time (program lifecycle phase);scalability;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;throughput;very-large-scale integration	Gang Xu;Sridhar Rajagopal;Joseph R.

Channel estimation is very important for suppressing interference and demultiplexing signals. In a wireless LAN system such as IEEE 802.11a, only a few training symbols are inserted in each subcarrier. First, we propose a channel estimation method for a MIMO-OFDM system with two training symbols per subcarrier. The basic idea is to estimate the time-domain channel responses between the transmit and receive antennas. The array response vectors for each subcarrier are calculated by applying a fast Fourier transform to them. We then can obtain the adaptive weights to cancel the interference. We show that employing training symbols having a lower condition number of the matrix used for the channel estimation improves the estimation accuracy. Furthermore, we show the bit error rate for several signal detection schemes using the above estimated channel. It is shown that an ordered successive detection based on an MMSE criterion has excellent performance, that is, it can achieve higher-speed transmissions with a lower transmit power.	channel state information;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing	Yasutaka Ogawa;Keisuke Nishio;Toshihiko Nishimura;Takeo Ohgane	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/E88-B.1.10	telecommunications;computer science;accuracy and precision;statistics	Mobile	50.43409963774941	73.26164016104535	62744

The spectral coding is based on the pseudoorthogonality of FO-CDMA codes properly written in the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) devices. A pair of maximal-length sequence codes is used to exemplify the coding and correlation processing among FO-CDMA user codes. Cooperating with TDMA and the tunable FBG coding devices, it can support more users without mass-deploying coding devices. Instead of making a direct correlation operation, we configure an FBG decoder scheme on basis of orthogonal correlation functions of nearly orthogonal m-sequence codes. With the devised FBG decoder architecture, an intended receiver user that operates on the defined orthogonal correlation functions will reject any interfering user and obtain a complete orthogonality between the FO-CDMA users in the system. Besides, we will show this devised system can provide a simple error detecting function.

Advantages of the method are that it is straightforward to parallelize, and that it offers a fully predictable runtime. PM trades performance for computational complexity via a user-defined parameter. In the limit of high computational complexity, the algorithm becomes the MAP demodulator. The PM algorithm also works with soft-input, but until now it has been unclear how to apply it for other modulation formats than binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) per real dimension. In this correspondence, we explain how to extend PM with soft-input to general signaling constellations, while maintaining the low complexity advantage of the original algorithm.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;key (cryptography);mimo;modulation	Daniel Persson;Erik G.

It reduces the tap-setting time to half of that required by the traditional half-duplex fast training schemes. However, its estimation accuracy may be degraded by the frequency offsets in both far echo and far signal that are caused by the analog carrier network. We extend the previous work and develop a new algorithm that can compensate for the phase rotation components introduced by these frequency offsets. The performance of the new method is analyzed in terms of mean-square error.

This allows the receiver to utilize the statistical characteristics of the source during the decoding process, and leads to significantly improved performance relative to systems in which source statistics are not exploited. One of the constituent decoders makes use of a modified trellis which jointly describes the source and the encoder. The number of states in this modified trellis is the product of the number of states in the hidden Markov source and the number of states in the encoder.	concatenated error correction code;concatenation;encoder;hidden markov model;markov chain;markov information source;open-source software;trellis quantization	Javier Garcia-Frias;John D.

In the case of synchronous CDMA, with random codes, it is possible to demonstrate the existence of a threshold in the load beyond which there is an apparent jump in computational complexity. At small load unit clause propagation can determine a jointly optimal detection of sources on a noiseless channel, but fails at high load. Analysis provides insight into the difference between the standard dense random codes and sparse codes, and the limitations of optimal detection in the sparse case.	code;computational complexity theory;software propagation;sparse matrix;unit propagation	Jack Raymond	2009	2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks	10.1109/WIOPT.2009.5291597	code division multiple access;detector;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;noise;theoretical computer science;cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition;mathematics;distributed computing;neural coding;computational complexity theory;statistics;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Arch	45.453573663266305	69.1648112575481	63532

In this paper, we demonstrate that this technique can be applied to pseudorandom code acquisition problems as well. To do this, we represent good pseudonoise (PN) patterns using sparse graphical models, then apply the standard iterative message passing algorithms over these graphs to approximate maximum-likelihood synchronization. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance than both serial and hybrid search strategies in that it works at low signal-to-noise ratios and is much faster. Compared with full parallel search, this approach typically provides significant complexity reduction.	approximation algorithm;block size (cryptography);casio loopy;channel state information;converge;duty cycle;flux balance analysis;forward–backward algorithm;goto;graphical model;heuristic;iteration;iterative method;linear-feedback shift register;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;message passing;modulation;polynomial;pseudocode;pseudorandom noise;pseudorandomness;reduction (complexity);search algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;ultra-wideband;whole earth 'lectronic link;xfig	Keith M.

The proposed maximum a posteriori detector is a combination of the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method and the variance reduction strategy known as Rao-Blackwellization. Being blind, the developed detector, does not rely on pilot tones for the detection of the transmitted data. However, as in most work found in the literature, the aforementioned detector, which we call the RB-SMC detector, invokes the assumption of a fixed and known channel order, which may be a limitation in a number of scenarios. Therefore, to relax this assumption, we model channel order uncertainty via a first-order Markov process and subsequently introduce appropriate extensions to the RB-SMC detector, thereby proposing a novel algorithm called the E-RB-SMC detector. The performance of the novel SMC-based detectors are validated through computer simulations. It is shown that the proposed SMC-based detectors achieve near bound performance. In terms of convergence speed, the proposed E-RB-SMC detector also shows the smallest acquisition time amongst the considered algorithms.	algorithm;computer simulation;download;first-order predicate;monte carlo method;multipath propagation;multiplexing;particle filter;phase noise;reduction strategy (lambda calculus);sensor;variance reduction	Derek Yee;James P.

Belief propagation in community detection has been studied under density evolution; this work for the first time brings EXIT analysis to community detection on random graphs, which has certain advantages that are well documented in the parallel context of error control coding. We show using simulations that in the case of equally-sized communities, when the probability of connectivity in the communities are different, there is only one intersection point on the EXIT curves, hence belief propagation is optimal. When the probability of connectivity in the communities are the same, we show that belief propagation is equivalent to random guessing and the EXIT curves intersect at the trivial zero-zero point. For the roughly equal-sized communities, we show that there is always only one intersection point on the EXIT curves, suggesting that belief propagation is optimal. Finally, for the communities with disparate size, we show that there are multiple intersection points, hence belief propagation is likely to be sub-optimal.	algorithm;approximation;belief propagation;coding theory;degree (graph theory);exit chart;error detection and correction;random graph;simulation;software propagation;stochastic block model	Hussein Saad;Ahmed Attia Abotabl;Aria Nosratinia	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541404	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;statistics;belief propagation	Vision	39.38743986714355	61.14770130261268	63762

The adaptive BLDCT-based excision algorithm uses a redundant library of biorthogonal local discrete cosine bases and an efficient concave cost function to match the transform basis to the interfering signal. The main advantage of the algorithm over conventional transform domain excision algorithms is that the basis functions are not fixed but can be adapted to the time-frequency structure of the interfering signal. It is well suited to transform domain compression and suppression of a variety of interference types. Compared with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) that provides logarithmic division of the frequency bands, the adaptive BLDCT can provide more flexible frequency resolution. Thus it is more insensitive to the jammer frequency. Simulation experiments demonstrate the improved bit error rate (BER) performance and the increased robustness of our receiver.

These algorithms are particularly interesting due to their low complexity (linear in the signal dimension n). The asymptotic analysis predicts the fraction of unverified signal elements at each iteration l in the asymptotic regime where n→∞. The analysis is similar in nature to the well-known density evolution technique commonly used to analyze iterative decoding algorithms. To perform the analysis, a message-passing interpretation of NB-VB algorithms is provided. This interpretation lacks the extrinsic nature of standard message-passing algorithms to which density evolution is usually applied. This requires a number of nontrivial modifications in the analysis. The analysis tracks the average performance of the recovery algorithms over the ensembles of input signals and sensing matrices as a function of l. Concentration results are devised to demonstrate that the performance of the recovery algorithms applied to any choice of the input signal over any realization of the sensing matrix follows the deterministic results of the analysis closely. Simulation results are also provided which demonstrate that the proposed asymptotic analysis matches the performance of recovery algorithms for large but finite values of n . Compared to the existing technique for the analysis of NB-VB algorithms, which is based on numerically solving a large system of coupled differential equations, the proposed method is more accurate and simpler to implement.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;compressed sensing;evolution;iteration;message passing;naive bayes classifier;numerical analysis;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Yaser Eftekhari;Anoosheh Heidarzadeh;Amir H.

Using matrix perturbation theory, we express both of them as perturbations of the ideal MMSE equalizer and we derive insightful analytical expressions for their excess mean square error. We observe that, in general, the mismatched MMSE equalizer performs (much) better than the LS equalizer. We attribute this phenomenon to the fact that the LS equalizer implicitly estimates the input second-order statistics, while the mismatched MMSE equalizer uses perfect knowledge. Thus, assuming that the input second-order statistics are known at the receiver, which is usually the case, the use of the mismatched MMSE equalizer is preferable, in general.	approximation algorithm;autocorrelation;channel state information;computation;equalization (communications);lossless jpeg;mean squared error;offset binary;perturbation theory	Athanasios P.

In order to compensate this effect, two autocalibration methods are proposed for the 2-D DOA estimation on a planar array. Both of them can estimate the DOAs without any iterative process or calibration sources. We prove that the effect of mutual coupling can be automatically eliminated by the inherent mechanism of the proposed methods. Moreover, they can also achieve an obvious performance improvement even when there is a coupling model mismatch. After getting the DOA estimations, two methods are proposed to estimate the mutual coupling coefficients. Moreover, these coefficient estimates can be used to further improve the accuracy of DOA estimations. The Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRB) for the parameter estimations are also presented as the benchmark. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. & 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper describes exact least-squares (LS) recursive lattice algorithms which resolve these uncertainties in a direct-sequence spread-spectrum digital communication system. The adaptive LS algorithm is recursive beth in order and time, and converges rapidly to the uncertain parameters. Time-discrete algorithms may be mechanized by a receiver containing integrate-and-dump circuits operating at the chip rate of the pseudonoise (PN) sequence, one in each in-phase and each quadrature channel of each sensor array element's output. Different configurations of optimal time-discrete receivers are presented and transformed into adaptive receivers by taking advantage of the spectral properties of the different kinds of LS filters. Simulation results are presented and some guide lines are given for the architecture of an adaptive direct-sequence spread-spectrum system.	algorithm;array data structure;distortion;download;evert willem beth;interference (communication);least squares;pseudorandom noise;pseudorandom number generator;recursion;simulation	Arie Reichman;Robert A.

In this paper, theta series of trellis codes are computed by using a modified transfer function originally for the union bound. We find that the low SNR region of the union bound dominates the secrecy gain.

Using multiple antennas for transmission and reception the multiuser detection problem can be cast as a BSS problem of linear instantaneous mixtures. The proposed method uses BSS in each subcarrier to detect the user signals. The source order and scaling indeterminacies inherent to BSS methods are overcome by exploiting the cross correlation between the subcarriers introduced by convolutional encoding. Additionally, the method provides an estimate of the channels. It is shown that this method provides significant performance enhancement over previous work.	blind signal separation;channel state information;convolutional code;cross-correlation;image scaling;mimo;multi-user;multiplexing;source separation;subcarrier	Luciano Sarperi;Asoke K.

The structure of the proposed detection scheme consists of a conventional differential detection circuit equipped with an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter combined with decision feedback. The results of theoretical analysis and computer simulation show that performance of the proposed detection method can approach that of coherent detection of DPSK under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) conditions without any increase in architectural complexity. Furthermore, a parameter of the proposed detector can be varied to optimize performance for static or fading conditions. An adaptive scheme suitable for time varying Rician-fading channel conditions is presented, and performance results obtained by computer simulation are given.	additive white gaussian noise;carrier recovery;coherence (physics);computer simulation;infinite impulse response;key (cryptography);modulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Naokazu Hamamoto	1996	IEEE Trans.

The performance predicted by these bounds are compared with simulation results and show close match in high signal to noise ratio (SNR) regions. The proposed bounds therefore provide good estimates on the error correction performance of TC-HARQ in high SNR regions where simulations are difficult to obtain reasonable results.	additive white gaussian noise;bit error rate;error detection and correction;error floor;hybrid automatic repeat request;retransmission (data networks);selective repeat arq;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;throughput;transfer function;turbo code;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Tao Shi;Lei Cao	2007	2007 IEEE 66th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2007.230	turbo code;electronic engineering;speech recognition;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;statistics	HPC	41.92007678010235	70.46577450722869	65461

Low complexity is achieved by reformulating Truongu0027s ME algorithm using the proposed polynomial manipulation scheme so that a more compact polynomial representation can be derived. Together with the developed folding scheme and simplified boundary cell, the resulting design effectively reduces the hardware complexity while meeting the throughput requirements of optical communication systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed RS(255, 239) decoder, implemented in the TSMC 0.18µm process, can operate at up to 425MHz and achieve a throughput rate of 3.4Gbps with a total gate count of 11,759.

For this reason, combinatorial methods have been employed to analyze the performance of finite-length LDPC codes under message passing decoding. The error floor phenomenon is a key issue of finite-length effects, which is caused largely by poorly connected subgraphs residing in the LPDC codes structure. Because of the unequal noise immunity of different bit levels, error floors become more pronounced for LDPC-coded high-order modulation. Nevertheless, the enumeration of error-prone patterns that lead to error floors has been proven to be NP-hard, which motivates us to find substitute metrics with manageable complexity. Considering trapping sets always comprise loops of low extrinsic message degree (EMD) and the connectivity of a loop with the residual graph can be characterized by its approximate EMD (ACE), in this paper we propose a fast method to identify loops with low ACE for a given code. In light of this, the vulnerable variable nodes residing on low-ACE loops are judiciously mapped to bit levels benefitting from stronger error protection. As a result, the error floor can be significantly improved at the cost of a minor increase of hardware complexity.	ace;additive white gaussian noise;adjacency matrix;approximation algorithm;bit-level parallelism;block code;casio loopy;cognitive dimensions of notations;dvb-s2;digital video broadcasting;error floor;flow network;forward error correction;heuristic;low-density parity-check code;message passing;modulation;np-hardness;prototype	Jing Lei;Wen Gao	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.216	concatenated error correction code;message passing;low-density parity-check code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;np-hard;distributed computing;error floor;algorithm;statistics;modulation	Visualization	41.319070907473694	60.99321455145128	65743

To realize this extension of OFDM with MIMO, a number of changes are required in the baseband signal processing. An overview is given of the necessary changes, including time and frequency synchronization, channel estimation, synchronization tracking, and MIMO detection. As a test case, the OFDM-based wireless local area network (WLAN) standard IEEE 802.11a is considered, but the results are applicable more generally. The complete MIMO OFDM processing is implemented in a system with three transmit and three receive antennas, and its performance is evaluated with both simulations and experimental test results. Results from measurements with this MIMO OFDM system in a typical office environment show, on average, a doubling of the system throughput, compared with a single antenna OFDM system. An average expected tripling of the throughput was most likely not achieved due to coupling between the transmitter and receiver branches.	algorithm;blast;baseband;channel state information;condition number;frequency divider;mimo;maximum throughput scheduling;multiplexing;online and offline;period-doubling bifurcation;phase noise;signal processing;simulation;software propagation;subcarrier;synchronization (computer science);test case;transmitter	Allert van Zelst;Tim C.

The receiver as well as the transmitter are assumed to have perfect knowledge of the channel, and the receiver is assumed to employ maximum likelihood detection. We propose to use linear precoding and lattice invariant operations to transform the channel matrix into a lattice with large coding gain. With appropriate approximations, it is shown that this corresponds to selecting lattices with good sphere packing properties. Lattice invariant transformations are then used to minimize the power consumption. An algorithm for this power minimization is presented along with a lower bound on the optimization. Numerical results indicate that there is a potential gain of several dB by using the method compared to channel inversion with adaptive bit loading.	alexander horned sphere;algorithm;approximation;code (cryptography);coding gain;lattice model (finance);mimo;mathematical optimization;numerical method;set packing;transmitter	Svante Bergman;Björn E.

f3f48ad1b7c952b47c8d31685749fdb7c3511144	lightweight hardware architecture for probabilistic gradient descent bit flipping on qc-ldpc codes		The Probabilistic Gradient Descent Bit-Flipping (PGDBF) decoder offers a significant improvement in decoding performance for Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes on Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). However, this outstanding decoding performance comes along with a non-negligible extra hardware cost to realize the probabilistic behavior on top of the deterministic Gradient Descent Bit-Flipping (GDBF) decoder. This paper presents a novel solution to implement PGDBF decoder on Quasi-Cyclic LDPC codes. The proposed architecture takes advantage of the cyclic shift permutation nature of QC-LDPC and changes the message flow such that a probabilistic behavior is emulated without the cost of an actual probabilistic signal generator. It is shown that, the proposed architecture improves the PGDBF decoding performance with respect to the state-of-the-art implementation while reducing hardware complexity, even being lower than that of the deterministic GDBF. The efficiency of our proposed method is verified through the ASIC 90nm CMOS technology implementations and decoding simulations.	application-specific integrated circuit;binary symmetric channel;cmos;circular shift;emulator;gradient descent;low-density parity-check code;simulation	Khoa Le;Ghaffari Fakhreddine;Lounis Kessal;David Declercq;Valentin Savin;Oana Boncalo	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351055	parallel computing;architecture;low-density parity-check code;hardware architecture;electronic engineering;probabilistic logic;decoding methods;logic gate;computer science;binary symmetric channel;gradient descent	Arch	44.09813285315779	62.46972701099123	66041

In this protocol, every 4-bit symbol is encoded into a sequence of 32 chips that are actually transmitted over the air. The 32 chips as a whole is also called a pseudonoise code (PN-Code). Due to complex channel conditions such as attenuation and interference, the transmitted PN-Code will often be received with some PN-Code chips corrupted. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis on these errors occurring at chip level. We find that there are notable error patterns corresponding to different cases. We then show that recognizing these patterns enables us to identify the channel condition in great details. We believe that understanding what happened to the transmission in our way can potentially bring benefit to channel coding, routing, and error correction protocol design. Finally, we propose Simple Rule, a simple yet effective method based on the chip error patterns to infer the link condition with an accuracy of over 96 percent in our evaluations.	4-bit;access control;algorithm;channel capacity;communications protocol;effective method;error detection and correction;error message;experiment;forward error correction;interference (communication);low-power broadcasting;over the air;phy (chip);pseudorandom noise;routing	Kaishun Wu;Haoyu Tan;Hoilun Ngan;Lionel M.

State-extension and branch-labeling is based only on the state labels at the current position and on the set of atomic generators, making it unnecessary to store the whole code tree. Using these results, we have devised a sequential stack algorithm for decoding binary linear block codes. By modifying the metric bias term according to received data, maximum-likelihood soft-decision decoding is guaranteed in the absence of stack overflow. At practical signal-to-noise ratios, the computational complexity of this sequential decoding scheme is much smaller on average than that of the Viterbi algorithm. Several modifications to the basic algorithm, including stack overflow handling, sorting of the received data, and fast push-through can be used to improve the characteristics of the variable-bias term sequential decoding algorithm. The result is a practical and general soft-decision decoding method for linear block codes.	linear code;trellis quantization	Vladislav Sorokine;Frank R.

For this purpose, we develop an accurate model of estimation errors in a block fading context and derive an analytical expression quantifying the impact of channel estimation errors on feedback MISO systems. In particular, the block fading model implies that the channel estimate and its error component are fixed for the entire block and an appropriate performance criteria is the average BLEP, a more complex metric to analyze. The derived closed form analytical expression for the average BLEP is validated by simulations.	beamforming;channel state information;rayleigh fading;simulation;system analysis	Yogananda Isukapalli;Bhaskar D.

Pilot assisted modulation techniques have been proposed to overcome multipath fading effects and an equalizer operating on the basis of a received pilot is commonly deployed. The pilot sequence used to train the equalizer is usually time division multiplexed with the information sequence. This solution reduces the bandwidth efficiency and may become unusable when too frequent updating of the communications parameters is needed in the receiver. In this letter it is shown that bandwidth efficiency can be preserved at the expense of an increase in transmit power. The additional transmitted power is used to send a known pilot sequence hidden into the information sequence. The pilot is superimposed onto the information symbols to be transmitted before waveform modulation. Therefore each pilot symbol has the same period of the information symbol so that bandwidth spreading is avoided. The M-QAM modulation format is considered but the technique can be extended to any digital communication system. The channel estimation problem is analyzed since the equalizer impulse response can be easily derived from the estimated channel impulse response. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed technique simulation results are provided.	channel state information	Franco Mazzenga	2002	European Transactions on Telecommunications	10.1002/ett.4460130313	electronic engineering;quadrature amplitude modulation;telecommunications;adaptive equalizer;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;demodulation;estimation theory	Vision	50.91984150321241	73.35303495737743	67220

Polynomial representations may help to explore further algebraic properties of polar codes, same as those for convolutional codes. The relationship between message and codeword polynomials of polar codes indicates that polar codes are highly related to convolutional codes with generator polynomials 1+D and 1/(1+D). By using polynomial representations, we show the input and output bit shift properties of polar codes. This property is then employed to construct redundant trellises for overcomplete representations. Simulation results show that belief propagation (BP) decoding over the proposed overcomplete representation can achieve a significant performance gain as compared with BP decoding over the overcomplete representation using trellis permutations.	belief propagation;bitwise operation;circular shift;code word;concatenation;convolutional code;input/output;linear algebra;list decoding;mathematics of cyclic redundancy checks;polar code (coding theory);polynomial;simulation;software propagation;trellis quantization	Mao-Ching Chiu	2013	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2013.111113.131721	block code;list decoding;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;convolutional code;sequential decoding;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;bcjr algorithm;linear code;mathematics;berlekamp–welch algorithm;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;statistics;polynomial	Theory	42.387396614816225	60.736245348207014	67667

Based on a training sequence transmitted by the desired user, we obtain a linear MMSE detector which does not require knowledge of the code sequences and the channel impulse response. The proposed spatial-temporal adaptive multiuser detection technique is shown to be robust against the near-far problem and computationally efficient by using subspace tracking algorithm.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;multi-user;signal subspace;simulation	Getian Ye;Guoan Bi;Zhengyu Li	2001	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2001.6596859	embedded system;code division multiple access;detector;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;antenna array;fading;detection theory;data transmission	Mobile	49.18021893987323	73.00000043509091	67737

Presently, the best known STBC for the 2 2 system is the Golden code and that for the 4 2 system is the DjABBA code. Following the approach by Biglieri, Hong, and Viterbo, a new STBC is presented in this paper for the 2 2 system. This code matches the Golden code in performance and ML-decoding complexity for square QAM constellations while it has lower ML-decoding complexity with the same performance for non-rectangular QAM constellations. This code is also shown to be information-lossless and diversity-multiplexing gain (DMG) tradeoff optimal. This design procedure is then extended to the 4 2 system and a code, which outperforms the DjABBA code for QAM constellations with lower ML-decoding complexity, is presented. So far, the Golden code has been reported to have an ML-decoding complexity of the order of for square QAM of size . In this paper, a scheme that reduces its ML-decoding complexity to is presented.	code;coding gain;decoding methods;lossless compression;mimo;multiplexing	K. Pavan Srinath;B. Sundar Rajan	2009	J. Sel.

By exploiting the cyclostationarity induced by the periodic precoder, a subspace-based channel identification algorithm that is resilient to the location of channel zeros, channel order overestimation errors, and color of additive stationary noise, is developed. The asymptotic performance of the subspace-based identification approach is analyzed and compared with the asymptotic lower bound provided by the nonlinear cyclic correlation matching approach. Criteria for optimally designing the periodic precoder are also presented. The performance of MMSE-FIR and MMSE-DFE equalizers is quantified for the proposed cyclostationarity-induced framework in terms of the MMSE. Although cyclostationarity-inducing transmitters present several advantages relative to their stationary counterparts from a channel estimation viewpoint, it is shown that from an equalization viewpoint, MIC-based systems exhibit a slightly increased MMSE/BER when compared with the stationary case.	algorithm;alphabet (formal languages);channel state information;cyclostationary process;finite impulse response;modulation;nonlinear system;profiling (computer programming);stationary process;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Antoine Chevreuil;Erchin Serpedin;Philippe Loubaton;Georgios B.

Polar codes can be understood as transformations that replace a probabilistic channel with parallel deterministic counterparts. This paper builds on this interpretation of polar codes, using it to perform alignment over the resulting deterministic channels to obtain gains for interference networks. It is important to note here that polar codes are not chosen with encoding and decoding complexity in mind, which is just a fortuitous side-benefit, but with the aim of transforming the original channels into a class of deterministic parallel channels over which interference-alignment is well-understood. A degraded one-sided interference network is chosen as the illustrative example. Polar alignment is shown to increase the achievable sum rate over known random coding schemes. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of possible extensions.	interference (communication);polar code (coding theory)	Kumar Appaiah;Onur Ozan Koyluoglu;Sriram Vishwanath	2011	2011 49th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/Allerton.2011.6120174	list decoding;electronic engineering;telecommunications;variable-length code;computer science;theoretical computer science	Theory	39.38321236647973	65.98198431638298	67945

We show that even in additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) environment, uniformly most powerful invariant (UMPI) test does not exist. Instead, the UMPI detector in known SNR is used as an upper performance bound for performance evaluation of any invariant detector performance. In addition, we derive generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) detectors for this signal in AWGN with unknown noise variance and also in clutter with unknown covariance matrix. The GLR test statistic for AWGN represents the ratio of the maximum power over all cells to the total power. The GLRT for a clutter environment is also a power ratio which is the maximum over all range cells of the Euclidean norms of the spatially whitened observed sequence. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed GLR test in AWGN is very close to the upper bound performance, i.e., to the UMPI test in known SNR.	additive white gaussian noise;clutter;detection theory;glr parser;maximum power transfer theorem;performance evaluation;phasor;radar;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;time of arrival;utility functions on indivisible goods;white noise	Mostafa Derakhtian;AliAkbar Tadaion;Saeed Gazor;Mohammad Mahdi Nayebi	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications	10.1016/j.sigpro.2006.06.003	additive white gaussian noise;electronic engineering;speech recognition;data processing;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	49.747786803517265	70.92474450422236	67976

We propose a two dimensional adaptive minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver, which works in decision-directed mode after an initial training period. A subcarrier phase tracker, which comprises a bank of phase locked-loops (PLLs), is employed in the receiver to track the fading phase variability. Furthermore, a simplified phase tracker structure is proposed to reduce the system complexity. The performance of the data detector and the behavior of the phase tracker are analyzed theorectically in this paper and are shown to match the simulation results. Both analysis and simulation indicate that the proposed system outperforms the conventional MC-DS-CDMA systems by exploiting frequency diversity and facilitating subcarrier synchronization.	carrier recovery;coefficient;intelligence amplification;iteration;mean squared error;monte carlo method;phase-locked loop;quantum phase estimation algorithm;simulation;spatial variability;subcarrier;telecommunications link;x.690	Rui Fa;Pei Xiao	2009	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2009.09.080131	electronic engineering;real-time computing;phase-locked loop;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	49.779698064472015	73.41114616597794	68038

While spectrally efficient, SSD improves the performance of QAM constellations over fading channels thanks to an increased diversity. In this paper, flexible mapper and demapper architectures for DVB-T2 standard are detailed. A detection based on the decomposition of the constellation into two-dimensional sub-regions in signal space associated to an algorithmic simplification constitute the main novelty of this work. They enable to strongly decrease the complexity of the demapper. The design and the FPGA prototyping of the resultant architecture are then described.

To realize DL(downlink)-MU-MIMO transmission, the MU-MIMO precoder is required in AP (access point) side for canceling an IUI (inter-user interference). However, a conventional IBD (iterative block diagonalization) precoder has a high computational complexity problem. Therefore, we propose a LC(low complexity)-IBD precoder whose complexity is reduced by using null vectors from CSI (channel state information) decompression process. The implementation result shows that our precoder can reduce computational complexity and latency.	application-specific instruction set processor;blu-ray;channel state information;computational complexity theory;data compression;interference (communication);ion beam deposition;iteration;iterative method;multi-user mimo;wireless access point;iui	Yuji Yokota;Shingo Yoshizawa;Hiroshi Ochi	2015	2015 15th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2015.7458361	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Arch	46.82410144361074	64.4975996119359	68897

The loop delay between these two signals must be controlled precisely so that the convergence of the predistorter should be assured. In this paper a novel two-stage loop delay correction scheme is presented. In the first stage, the integer delay between the input signal and the feedback signal is estimated based on the cross-correlation of them. In the second stage, the fractional delay between these two signals are corrected by a delay lock loop (DLL) circuit, in which a novel timing error detector used as the discriminator is proposed. The proposed loop delay correction scheme is applied to an adaptive digital predistorter in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Simulation results show that the proposed loop delay correction method eliminates the loop delay perfectly, so that nearly optimal power spectral density (PSD) performance is achieved and a high degree of linearization is realized.	audio power amplifier;cross-correlation;delay-locked loop;discriminator;error detection and correction;feedback;mimo-ofdm;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;multiplexing;simulation;spectral density	Shigang Tang;Ke Gong;Jun Wang;Kewu Peng;Chang-Yong Pan;Zhixing Yang	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.372	electronic circuit;error detection and correction;convergence;delay calculation;computer science;amplifier;delay-locked loop;cross-correlation;group delay and phase delay;control theory;feedback;mathematics;spectral density;digital delay line;statistics	EDA	53.68963658571148	69.28912380881873	69498

Capitalizing on the observation that the decision region of SIC is determined by the Gram-Schmidt vectors rather than the basis itself, we propose the use of effective LLL reduction in SIC decoding, where size reduction is only performed for pairs of consecutive basis vectors. We establish the theoretic upper bound O(n3 log n) on the average complexity of effective LLL reduction for the i.i.d.

In this paper, we present a multistage linear parallel interference cancellation (LPIC) approach to mitigate the effect of this MUI in uplink OFDMA. The proposed scheme first performs CFO compensation (in time-domain) followed by K DFT operations (where K is the number of users) and multistage LPIC on these DFT outputs. We scale the MUI estimates by weights before cancellation and optimize these weights by maximizing the average signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) at the output of the different stages of the LPIC. We derive closed-form expressions for these optimum weights. The proposed LPIC scheme is shown to effectively cancel the MUI caused by the other user CFOs in uplink OFDMA. While our proposed approach performs CFO compensation in time-domain, an alternate approach proposed recently by Huang and Letaief performs CFO compensation and interference cancellation in frequency-domain. We show that our approach performs better than the Huang & Letaief's approach when the magnitude of the CFO differences (between desired user CFO and other user CFOs) are small, whereas their approach performs better when the magnitude of the individual CFOs (of other users) are small. Since the CFO values can be arbitrary at the receiver, in order to make the receiver robust under various CFO conditions, we propose simple metrics based on CFO knowledge, which the receiver can compute and use to choose between the time-domain (ours) and the frequency-domain (Huang & Letaief's) cancellers so that better performance among the two approaches is achieved under various CFO conditions.	artificial intelligence: a modern approach;carrier frequency;frequency divider;interference (communication);magic user interface;motion compensation;multi-user;multistage amplifier;telecommunications link	Shamaiah Manohar;Dheeraj Sreedhar;Vibhor Tikiya;Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam	2007	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2007.05905	parallel processing;knowledge base;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing	Mobile	49.92931264245909	73.3013274383945	69711

For the hard output scheme the design can achieve an average throughput of 257.8 Mbps at 24 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with area equivalent to 54.2 Kgates and a power consumption of 7.26 mW. For the soft output scheme it achieves an average throughput of 83.3 Mbps across the SNR range of interest with an area equivalent to 64 Kgates and a power consumption of 11.5 mW.	algorithm;breadth-first search;cmos;clock rate;complexity;computer simulation;data rate units;decision tree;depth-first search;mimo;search algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput;very-large-scale integration;x.690	Chung-An Shen;Ahmed M.

The proposed precoder design differs from the previously proposed precoders as follows: 1) Existing precoders are applicable when there exists only transmit correlation and no receive correlations, however, the proposed precoder is applicable to correlated Ricean MIMO channels with an invertible correlation matrix. 2) We minimize the upper bound of the PEP of non-orthogonal STBC for obtaining a precoder over correlated Ricean channels, whereas, one existing precoder minimizes an upper bound of PEP for orthogonal STBC (OSTBC). The proposed precoder outperforms two existing precoders for non-orthogonal STBC especially for highly correlated channels.	code;mimo;mimo-ofdm;pairwise error probability	Manav R.

These analyses demonstrate the coding advantages available for systems operating with and without frequency diversity. Utilizing both the exact approach (where possible) and upper-bounding approaches (Chernoff and union bounds), the decoded bit error rates for typical error-correcting codes (binary and M -ary, block and convolutional) have been obtained, and these codes have been compared according to the E_{b}/N_{0} required to achieve a bit error rate of 10 -5 . The best performance is achieved with the use of M -ary signaling and optimum diversity with M -ary codes, such as Reed-Solomon block codes, dual- k convolutional codes, convolutional orthogonal codes, or concatenated codes.

In its full generality, this problem is known to be NP-complete. Recently, the expected complexity of the sphere decoder, a particular algorithm that solves the ML problem exactly, has been computed. An asymptotic analysis of this complexity has also been done where it is shown that the required computations grow exponentially in N for any fixed SNR. At the same time, numerical computations of the expected complexity show that there are certain ranges of rates, SNRs and dimensions N for which the expected computation (counted as the number of scalar multiplications) involves no more than N3 computations. However, when the dimension of the problem grows too large, the required computations become prohibitively large, as expected from the asymptotic exponential complexity. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that, for large N, offers substantial computational savings over the sphere decoder, while maintaining performance arbitrarily close to ML. We statistically prune the search space to a subset that, with high probability, contains the optimal solution, thereby reducing the complexity of the search. Bounds on the error performance of the new method are proposed. The complexity of the new algorithm is analyzed through an upper bound. The asymptotic behavior of the upper bound for large N is also analyzed which shows that the upper bound is also exponential but much lower than the sphere decoder. Simulation results show that the algorithm is much more efficient than the original sphere decoder for smaller dimensions as well, and does not sacrifice much in terms of performance	algorithm;computation;decoding methods;np-completeness;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;time complexity;with high probability	Radhika Gowaikar;Babak Hassibi	2007	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2006.890912	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;asymptotic analysis;np-complete;soft-decision decoder;worst-case complexity;mathematics;maximum likelihood;lattice;upper and lower bounds;computational complexity theory;signal-to-noise ratio;antenna array;asymmetry;statistics	Theory	43.49606165406522	65.78808571155221	70891

We present a simple algorithm for computer implementation of the technique. We present computer simulation results for both line-of-sight and diffuse transmitter configurations. In both cases we find that reflections of multiple order are a significant source of intersymbol interference.

The proposed encoding method is applicable to parity-check matrices having dual-diagonal parity structure with single column of weight 3. Unlike finding a direct solution for parity bits in schemes (Richardson and Urbanke, 2001 and Classon and Blankeship, 2004), the proposed scheme first generates arbitrary parity bits. Then, given the parity bits for the first sub-block and exploiting the dual-diagonal structure, all parity bits are found through correction. With slight modification of parity-check matrix H, proposed LDPC encoding scheme is directly applicable to matrices defined in IEEE physical layer standards with almost negligible performance loss. Moreover, the overall computational complexity involving encoding process is lower than well-known Richardson's efficient encoding scheme (Richardson and Urbanke, 2001).	algorithm;circulant matrix;computational complexity theory;cyclic permutation;line code;low-density parity-check code;parity bit;parity-check matrix;qr code;richardson number;vii	Chanho Yoon;Eunyoung Choi;Minho Cheong;Sok-Kyu Lee	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.127	discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	Vision	43.25708544256328	61.327424931424424	71020

New equations for packet success probabilities (PSP) are developed that can be used to efficiently compute the PSP of both slotted and unslotted CDMA networks for various Nakagami fading conditions, including Rayleigh fading. The packets may be uncoded or block-coded for error correction. The computed PSP was used to evaluate the throughputs of slotted and unslotted networks, based on a Poisson packet traffic model. Simulation results show that the new PSP equations are accurate and computationally efficient.	algorithmic efficiency;apollonian network;approximation;bandlimiting;error detection and correction;mast radiator;network packet;performance evaluation;rayleigh fading;simulation	Jen-Shiun Chen	2010	International Performance Computing and Communications Conference	10.1109/PCCC.2010.5682294	block code;error detection and correction;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network	HPC	39.46352998177251	72.05964257038244	71225

The diversity available in multiple descriptions is subsequently exploited in Viterbi sequence detectors to jointly decode the convolutional codes. Two approaches to joint decoding are presented and investigated. Simulation results are presented for two-channel multiple description quantization of Gaussian sources which demonstrate the potential improvements in end-to-end source distortion achievable with joint decoding of channel codes in a multiple description system. We also compare the performance of joint Viterbi detectors with that of turbo-style iterative decoding of multiple-description codes proposed earlier.	binary erasure channel;channel capacity;convolutional code;data compression;distortion;encoder;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;finite-state machine;information source;iterative method;map;quantization (signal processing);sensor;simulation;trellis quantization;viterbi algorithm;viterbi decoder	Pradeepa Yahampath;Upul Samarawickrama	2005	GLOBECOM '05.

A code word is defined as a sequence of r-phase values and transmitted either modulated on a carrier or transformed into n = 2r samples on a baseband channel. An algebraic procedure is used to generate the phase sequence from a set of p equidistant angles. The baseband model is analyzed in detail and the performance is evaluated by first assuming an ideal detector and computing an error-probability bound. Taking p = 61,73, and 97, codes are shown to exist that perform close to the theoretical limit. The algebraic structure of these codes much simplifies the numerical analysis. A second receiver is defined that extracts phase values out of the received waveform and then performs a suitable quantization. The degradation of this detector appears to be moderate for low information rates when evaluated for p = 61. A carrier phase-modulated system is also defined and evaluated with a performance quite similar to the baseband model.	additive white gaussian noise;bandlimiting;baseband;code word;elegant degradation;linear algebra;modulation;numerical analysis;polyphase quadrature filter;quantization (signal processing);waveform	Lars-Henning Zetterberg	1965	IEEE Trans.

The control law governing the timing estimation of the tracking loop are then derived based on the correlation properties of Chebychev polynomials. The loop error curves are simulated for various timing differences between early and late gates and the results are compared to the experimental results obtained from a digital signal processor with very close agreement.The tracking loop performance in terms of instantaneous and cumulative timing estimation is examined with and without noise by simulation and hardware implementation. It is found that robust non-coherent tracking of the chaotic chips is possible using signal processing algorithms if discrete mapped chaotic signals are used. It is also found that the theoretical concept is fully implementable in hardware showing close agreement with the theoretical analysis.	algorithm;chaos theory;coherent;digital signal processor;logistic map;modulation;optimal control;polynomial;shapiro polynomials;signal processing;simulation;theoretical definition	Ramin Vali;Stevan M.

The DMT scheme is realized by a transceiver that divides the channel into subbands. The efficiency of the scheme depends on the frequency selectivity of the transmitting and receiving filters. The receiving filters with good stopband attenuation are also desired for combating narrowband noise. The filterbank transceiver or discrete wavelet multitone (DWMT) system has been proposed as an implementation of the DMT transceiver that has better frequency band separation, but usually, inrtersymbol interference (ISI) cannot be completely canceled in these filterbank transceivers, and additional equalization is required. In this paper, we show how to use over interpolated filterbanks to design ISI-free FIR transceivers. A finite impulse response (FIR) transceiver with good frequency selectivity can be designed, as will be demonstrated by design examples.	catastrophic interference;digital monetary trust;discrete cosine transform;filter bank;finite impulse response;frequency band;image noise;information sciences institute;interference (communication);interpolation;modulation;selectivity (electronic);transceiver;transmitter;wavelet	Yuan-Pei Lin;See-May Phoong	2001	IEEE Trans.

We propose and evaluate decoding techniques that make use of such capabilities to increase the probability of successful decoding. We propose a metric derived from statistics collected during demodulation in a binary CDMA receiver. We investigate several methods to apply the proposed metric to the demodulator's soft-decision outputs prior to decoding. Our soft-decision decoding techniques are designed to mitigate the effects of interference from other signals in the frequency band. We compare the performance of our proposed metric to the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) metric, which requires that the mean signal level and noise variance are known for each bit position. Rather than attempt to estimate these parameters directly, our metric uses demodulator statistics and thus does not require pilot symbols or training sequences typically required by an LLR-based metric.	algorithm;bit numbering;decoding methods;frequency band;interference (communication);lucas–lehmer–riesel test;multipath propagation;network packet;overhead (computing);primary source;signal-to-noise ratio;soft-decision decoder;software propagation	Steven W.

The performance of a non-iterative receiver consisting of a maximum-likelihood detector with QR decomposition and M-algorithm maximum-likelihood detection is exploited, by employing irregular low-density parity-check code as the channel code. The threaded distribution of each coded information sub-stream in the proposed LSTF architecture makes it achieve the spatial, temporal, and frequency diversities the same as the conventional single-encoder LSTF architecture where coding is applied across the whole information stream, and simulation results show that the performance of the proposed multiple-encoder LSTF architecture is very close to that of the conventional single-encoder LSTF architecture. However, because of the use of multiple parallel encoders/decoders with a shorter codeword length, the proposed LSTF architecture has much lower hardware processing speed and complexity than that of the conventional LSTF architecture.

The Viterbi algorithm is employed to implement the MLSE in the asynchronous uplink. In this scheme, the various bit-combinations are taken to be the different states in the decoding trellis. However, the number of states increases exponentially with the number of active users. We propose a scheme that exploits the feature of power-equality in the downlink to reduce the number of states involved. Each transmitted chip value can only take a certain number of possible discrete values. Using these discrete values as the states in the transition trellis diagram and operating the Viterbi algorithm at the chip level, the number of states is reduced from 4/sup K/ to (K+1)/sup L/ where K is the number of users and L is the number of paths in the multipath channel.	multi-user;telecommunications link;trellis quantization	Hak K.

With an unquantized receiver, coding based on algebraic rotations is known to achieve modulation coding diversity. On the other hand, with a quantized receiver, algebraic rotations may not guarantee diversity. Through analysis, we propose specific rotations which result in the codewords having equidistant component-wise projections. We show that the proposed coding scheme achieves maximum modulation diversity with a low-complexity minimum distance decoder.	modulation	Saif K.

Due to the rotational invariance of DPSK, it particularly enables detection without channel state information (CSI). However, the soft-input soft-output (SISO) component decoder for DPSK is the computational bottleneck if performance close to the ideal case of perfect CSI is desired. In this paper, we take a fresh look at SISO decoding without CSI and apply sphere decoding (SD) to reduce complexity. In particular, we devise a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) multiple-symbol differential sphere decoder (MSDSD) which efficiently solves the high-dimensional search problem inherent to detection without CSI. Together with a soft-output generation device the MAP-MSDSD algorithm forms a new SISO-MSDSD module for iterative decoding. We analyze the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) characteristic of the novel module, by means of which we are able to design powerful encoder and decoder structures. For, respectively, the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and the continuously time-varying Rayleigh-fading channel without CSI these designs operate within 1.7-1.9 and 2.3-2.5 dB of channel capacity assuming perfect CSI. These figures compare favorably with results available in the literature, especially for reasonably high data rates of 1-2 bit/channel use.

Bit-interleaved coded modulation gives good diversity gains with higher order modulation schemes using well-known binary convolutional codes on a single transmit and receive antenna link. By using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), wideband transmission can be achieved over frequency-selective fading radio channels without adaptive equalizers. In this correspondence, we combine these three ideas into a family of flexible space-time coding methods. The pairwise error probability is analyzed based on the correlated fading assumption. Near-optimum iterative decoders are evaluated by means of simulations for slowly varying wireless channels. Theoretical evaluation of the achievable degree of diversity is also presented. Significant performance gains over the wireless local area network (LAN) 802.11a standard system are reported.	binary decoder;convolutional code;data compression;frequency divider;iterative method;modulation;multiplexing;pairwise error probability;simulation;well-known text	Inkyu Lee;Albert M.

The analysis is carried out using the scaling approach proposed in [1]. Two punctured ensembles are considered: (a) randomly punctured ensembles, in the sense that each bit of a codeword is punctured with some puncturing probability; (b) ensembles with a fixed puncturing fraction of bits of each degree. In both cases, parameters of the scaling approximation are completely determined in terms of the ensemble parameters such as left, right and puncturing degree distributions.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation;battery eliminator circuit;binary erasure channel;code word;emoticon;image scaling;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;numerical analysis;puncturing;randomness;simulation;vii;waterfall model	Rüdiger L.

A combined Gray/Ungerboeck scheme is used to label each QAM constellation. The Gray-labeled bits are protected using an irregular LDPC code with iterative soft-decision decoding, while other bits are protected using a high-rate Reed-Solomon code with hard-decision decoding (or are left uncoded). The rate of the LDPC code is selected by analyzing the capacity of the channel seen by the Gray-labeled bits and is made adaptive by selective concatenation with an inner repetition code. Using a practical bit-loading algorithm, we apply this coding scheme to an ensemble of frequency-selective channels with Gaussian noise. Over a large number of channel realizations, this coding scheme provides an average effective coding gain of more than 7.5 dB at a bit-error rate of 10/sup -7/ and a block length of approximately 10/sup 5/ b. This represents a gap of approximately 2.3 dB from the Shannon limit of the additive white Gaussian noise channel, which could be closed to within 0.8-1.2 dB using constellation shaping.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;bit error rate;block code;coding gain;concatenation;decibel;delta modulation;digital monetary trust;digital subscriber line;error detection and correction;iteration;low-density parity-check code;noise shaping;noisy-channel coding theorem;power-line communication;reed–solomon error correction;repetition code;shannon (unit);shannon–hartley theorem;signal-to-noise ratio;soft-decision decoder;trellis quantization;utility functions on indivisible goods	Masoud Ardakani;Tooraj Esmailian;Frank R.

In such systems, optimal precoding with only covariance feedback is derived using the minimum pair-wise error probability (PEP) criterion; linear and non-linear precoders are designed. The proposed precoding only needs the statistical knowledge of the channel at the transmitter, which significantly reduces the feedback requirements. Both linear and non-linear precoders substantially improve the system bit error rate (BER) for OSTBC OFDM in transmit-antenna and path-correlated channels.

A soft iterative receiver structure is developed, which consists of three main blocks: a soft MIMO detector and two LDPC component soft decoders. We first propose at the component level several soft-input soft-output MIMO detectors whose performances are much better than the conventional minimal mean square error (MMSE)-based detectors. In particular, one optimal soft MIMO detector and two simplified suboptimal detectors are developed that do not require an explicit channel estimate and offer an effective tradeoff between complexity and performance. In addition, a modified expectation maximization (EM)-based MIMO detector is developed that completely removes positive feedback between input and output extrinsic information and provides much better performance compared with the direct EM-based detector that has strong correlations especially in fast-fading channels. At the structural level, the LDPC-coded MIMO receiver is constructed in an unconventional manner where the soft MIMO detector and LDPC variable node decoder form one super soft-decoding unit, and the LDPC check node decoder forms the other component of the iterative decoding scheme. By exploiting the proposed receiver structure, tractable extrinsic information transfer functions of the component soft decoders are obtained, which further lead to a simple and efficient LDPC code degree profile optimization algorithm with proven global optimality and guaranteed convergence from any initialization. Finally, numerical and simulation results are provided to confirm the advantages of the proposed design approach for the coded MIMO system.	channel state information;cobham's thesis;expectation–maximization algorithm;input/output;iteration;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;mimo;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;numerical analysis;parity bit;performance;positive feedback;program optimization;sensor;simulation;transmitter	Jun Zheng;Bhaskar D.

In particular, the performance of some error-correction block codes and of the Go-Back-N retransmission scheme is investigated, when a packetized stream of bits is to be transmitted across a burst-error channel. The presence of a delay constraint causes degraded the error-correction performance (due to nonideal interleaving) and block dropping in Go-Back-N (due to retransmission delay). An approximate characterization of the residual bit error rate at the output of the error-control scheme is presented, and the effect of the channel burstiness, type of codes used, and channel data rate on the tradeoffs between the residual bit error rate and delay, and between the delay and achievable information rate is examined.	burst error;error detection and correction	Michele Zorzi	2001	IEEE Trans.

Carrier frequency offset between transmitter and receiver local oscillators must be estimated and compensated at the receiver to maintain orthogonality of these subchannels. In this paper, we derive the nonlinear least squares (NLS) estimator for carrier frequency synchronization that exploits receiver diversity and known OFDM signal subspace structure due to the placement of unmodulated (virtual) subcarriers. The resulting estimator benefits from the high-resolution subspace method without the computational overhead associated with subspace decomposition. Fundamental estimator performance relationships against parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), frequency-selective fading, and diversity branch correlation are derived. In particular, we derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the mean square error (MSE) of the carrier frequency offset estimator. Numerical studies are presented to verify the results.	carrier frequency offset;colors of noise;elegant degradation;fisher information;formation matrix;frequency divider;hp 48 series;image resolution;level of detail;mimo;mean squared error;multiplexing;non-linear least squares;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;overhead (computing);signal subspace;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;toeplitz hash algorithm;transmitter;x.690	Ufuk Tureli;Patrick J.

An optimum symbol-by-symbol MU detector is derived and its practical implementation with reduced-complexity is considered. According to the numerical results, the MU detector performs very close to a system free of interference by other users, when each user has more than one receiving antenna. For three receiving antennas, this difference is less than 0.25 dB, 0.4 dB, and 0.6 dB for two, three and four users, respectively. Moreover, the proposed system is bandwidth efficient as CPM is a bandwidth efficient modulation scheme, and the MU system only uses the single user CPM bandwidth.	decibel;interference (communication);modulation;multi-user;numerical analysis;rayleigh fading	Dhammika Bokolamulla;Tor Aulin	2005	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2005.10031	computer simulation;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;iterative method	Mobile	46.027736471510046	73.67058202580989	76329

Because of the difficulty in defining the SNR, NF depends on how the SNR is computed and the underlying assumptions that are made. Existing NF measures and their shortcomings are explained. A new NF suitable for digital communication receiver is proposed by redefining the SNR, so that the NF measures the degradation in the achievable performance caused by the receiving system. The proposed NF, which we refer to as the effective NF, can be readily determined based on the existing NF measurement techniques.	definition;elegant degradation;image scaling;input/output;new foundations;noise figure;norm (social);signal-to-noise ratio	Won Namgoong;Jongrit Lerdworatawee	2003		10.1109/ISQED.2003.1194725	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;signal-to-noise ratio	Graphics	39.75221118743329	70.28622243960535	77036

Along with asymptotic performances analysis, the optimization of 'irregularity' profile for different channels and the performance analysis of practical finite-length codes has also been extensively explored. With multi-carrier communications becoming the physical layer choice for many emerging wireless systems, a feasible solution for optimizing the irregularity profile of irregular LDPC codes for a frequency selective channel is a problem of particular importance and interest. This paper proposes a simple-to-implement greedy 'check' allocation (GCA) based method for the construction of BER-optimized irregular LDPC codes using the criterion of Gallager upper bound (Gallager, 1962) for probabilistic decoding. A comparison of our GCA algorithm with some existing works (Mannoni et al., 2002) on the irregular LDPC codes optimization for multicarrier systems based on the classical Gaussian approximation of the 'density evolution' approach, shows that the same irregularity behavior can be achieved with a much simpler method.	approximation;coefficient;continuation;field-programmable gate array;greedy algorithm;low-density parity-check code;mathematical optimization;mike lesser;parity bit;performance;real-time clock;resultant;richardson number;x.690	Asad Mahmood;Emmanuel Jaffrot	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.132	combinatorics;low-density parity-check code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;error floor;approximation algorithm;statistics	Metrics	42.969191268299966	68.74507596107664	77627

A blind channel estimation technique is used to estimate the nature of the multi-user channel at the detector (before the decoder). The path gains obtained from the channel estimation technique are used to adapt the code rates. Punctured codes derived from a specific rate 1/2 (M=4) mother code are used to provide error protection corresponding to the actual channel state. The upper and lower bounds on the bit error probability and the upper bound on the error event probability are derived for hard-decision and soft-decision decoding over Rayleigh and Rician fading channels. The throughput gains obtained using the adaptive scheme and the performances of the punctured codes are studied.	convolutional code;neural coding	Vidhyacharan Bhaskar;Laurie L.

OFDM parameter sets have been adjusted both to the UMTS chip rate and to the selectivity of the urban multipath propagation channel. The application of JSCD to UMTS codes may lead to signal to noise improvements greater than 3 dB. A methodology is also proposed to get soft error patterns attached to the transmission system, including the OFDM modulation and the multipath channel. Thus, several JSCD schemes can be accurately evaluated thanks to an equivalent simplified model.	convolutional code;markov chain;markov information source;modulation;multipath propagation;selectivity (electronic);simulation;soft error;software deployment;software propagation;turbo code;variable-length code	Marion Jeanne;Isabelle Siaud;Olivier Seller;Pierre Siohan	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-27824-5_120	equivalent circuit;chip;multipath propagation;selectivity;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;soft error;channel code;telecommunications;variable-length code;computer science;reliability;computer network	Mobile	40.75527769444563	68.80390379056867	78071

Because channel state information may be costly or impossible to acquire in rapidly varying wireless environments, we develop in this paper statistical water-filling approaches for stationary random fading channels. The resulting optimal designs require only knowledge of the channel's second order statistics that do not require frequent updates, and can be easily acquired. Optimality refers to minimizing a tight bound on the symbol error rate. Applied to a multiple transmit-antenna paradigm, the optimal precoder turns out to be a generalized eigen-beamformer with multiple beams pointing to orthogonal directions along the eigenvectors of the channel's covariance matrix, and with proper power loading across the beams. Coupled with orthogonal space time block codes, two-directional eigen-beamforming emerges as a more attractive choice than conventional one-directional beamforming, with uniformly better performance, and without rate reduction or complexity increase.	beamforming;eigen (c++ library);transmitter	Shengli Zhou;Georgios B.

Specifically, we design a space-time cooperative system based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which we refer to as a cooperative (CO)-OFDM system. Our design includes a two-phase space-time cooperation protocol, as well as a transmitter and receiver architecture that facilitates cooperation. Furthermore, we devise a frame structure, on which we build practical timing and frequency synchronization algorithms and a channel estimation algorithm. In particular, the proposed frequency synchronization algorithm utilizes the underlying structure of the cooperation protocol, and the proposed channel estimation algorithm is based on a pairwise orthogonal construction of two sequences. We validate the performance of the proposed synchronization and channel estimation algorithms through simulations. We then present simulation results that demonstrate the overall performance advantage of the CO-OFDM system over an OFDM system without cooperation, not only under idealistic assumptions but also under realistic situations where the proposed algorithms are employed.	algorithm;channel state information;consensus dynamics;frequency divider;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;simulation;synchronization (computer science);transmitter;two-phase commit protocol	Oh-Soon Shin;Albert M.

Reliable soft information from the channel output improves the performance of the forward error correction decoding algorithm. This paper proposes an improved method of extracting reliability information in the form of a DM for rectangular 16-QAM over flat Rayleigh fading channels. The reliability information is obtained from the derived Scaled Channel State Information (CSI), and the estimated CSI which result due to variations in the Rayleigh fading channel gain. The Koetter and Vardy, Reed-Solomon (KV-RS) algebraic soft-decision decoding algorithm is used to verify the performance of this proposed method. The performance of this proposed method is documented through computer simulation. From the simulation results, the proposed method achieves significant improvement in Codeword Error Rate (CER) performance in comparison with the conventional DM method in literature with no additional computational time complexity.	algorithm;cosmo-rs;channel state information;code word;computer simulation;error detection and correction;forward error correction;modulation;rayleigh fading;reed–solomon error correction;soft-decision decoder;time complexity	Olayinka O.

The fundamental principle of TCSM is to use convolutional encoding and Maximum-Likelihood Sequence Estimation (MLSE) decoding to increase the free distance between sequences of spatial constellation points, thus improving, especially over spatially correlated fading channels, the end-to-end system performance. In this paper, we propose tight analytical bounds for performance analysis of TCSM over correlated fading channels. In particular, the contributions of this paper are as follows: i) we propose two asymptotically tight (for high Signal-to-Noise-Ratios, SNRs) upper bounds for the analysis of uncoded SM schemes, which offer a better accuracy than already existing frameworks, ii) we propose a simple Chernoff bound for performance analysis of TCSM, which, although weak, can well capture the diversity order of the system, and iii) we propose an asymptotically tight (for high SNRs) true union bound for the accurate performance prediction of TCSM over correlated fading channels. Analytical frameworks and findings will also be substantiated via Monte Carlo simulations.	chernoff bound;convolutional code;encoder;end system;end-to-end principle;mimo;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;modulation;monte carlo method;performance prediction;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh–ritz method;simulation;trellis quantization	Marco Di Renzo;Raed Mesleh;Harald Haas;Peter M.

In this new scheme, a low density parity code (LDPC) is combined with a complexity reduced power reallocation algorithm to utilize the excess powers which margin from the powers necessary to meet the modulation level selected under a certain BER constraint. Furthermore, by taking full advantage of the residual excess powers, unequal error protection on important bits of video streams is provided by the LDPC code. Accordingly, the transmission efficiency and quality are both increased. Simulation results have shown that the proposed scheme may achieve great improvement in both systems with or without perfect channel estimation.	algorithm;channel state information;low-density parity-check code;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;offset binary;parity bit;peak signal-to-noise ratio;qr code;simulation;streaming media;throughput;x.690	Congchong Ru;Liuguo Yin;Jianhua Lu;Chang Wen Chen	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.63	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;statistics;computer network	Mobile	44.70453337732288	67.88517973879115	78844

Our model covers the complete transmission system including the rate-distortion performance of the video encoder, forward error correction, interleaving, and the effect of error concealment and interframe error propagation at the video decoder. The channel model used is a 2-state Markov model describing burst errors on the symbol level. Reed-Solomon codes are used for forward error correction. Extensive simulation results using an H.263 video codec are provided for verification. Using the model, the optimal tradeoff between INTRA and INTER coding as well as the optimal channel code rate can be determined for given channel parameters by minimizing the expected MSE at the decoder. The main focus of this paper is to show the accuracy of the derived analytical model and its applicability to the analysis and optimization of an entire video transmission system.	burst error;channel (communications);channel capacity;code rate;codec;cognitive dimensions of notations;data compression;distortion;encoder;error concealment;error detection and correction;forward error correction;lossy compression;markov chain;markov model;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;propagation of uncertainty;reed–solomon error correction;simulation;software propagation;symbol level;video decoder	Klaus Stuhlmüller;Nikolaus Färber;Michael Link;Bernd Girod	2000	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.848253	systems modeling;index term;rate–distortion theory;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;propagation of uncertainty;theoretical computer science;mean squared error;forward error correction;markov process;markov model;error exponent;reed–solomon error correction;statistics	Vision	41.235829307654626	65.2359107122521	79135

After the clipping in an MIMO-OFDM system, the additive noise may not be white. In this paper, we develop fast ML decoding algorithms for orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC) and quasi orthogonal space-time block codes (QOSTBC) in clipped MIMO-OFDM systems by using a clipping noise model with Gaussian approximation. By using the statistics of the clipping distortions, our newly proposed fast ML decoding algorithms improve the performance for clipped MIMO-OFDM systems with OSTBC and QOSTBC without increasing the decoding complexity.

Linear suppressed-carrier modulation is assumed. The work here aims at laying a conceptual foundation for optimum symbol-by-symbol detection, and rectifies existing approaches to the problem. The optimum receiver structure is obtained explicitly for an arbitrary carrier phase model, but its computational requirements are too heavy in general for any practical implementation. In one important special case, namely, the case in which the carrier phase can be treated as a constant over some K + 1 symbol intervals, the optimum receiver can be approximated by a readily implementable decision-feedback structure at high SNR. Simulated error performance results are presented for this latter receiver for PSK modulations with various carrier phase models. Since a decision-feedback receiver can encounter a “runaway,” a variation of this receiver is developed which uses feedforward of tentative decisions concerning future symbols. This modified receiver does not have any “runaway” problem, and has been shown to yield good error performance via simulations.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;computation;digital data;feedforward neural network;modulation;pre-shared key;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Pooi Yuen Kam;Seng Slew Ng;Tok Soon Ng	1994	IEEE Trans.

In third-generation (3G) wireless systems channel coding techniques must serve both voice and data users whose requirements considerably vary. Thus the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard offers two coding techniques, convolutional-coding for voice and Turbo-coding for data services. In this paper we present a combined channel decoding architecture for 3G terminal applications. It outperforms a solution based on two separate decoders due to an ef.cient reuse of computational hardware and memory resources for both decoders. Moreover it supports blind transport format detection. Special emphasis is put on low energy consumption.	binary decoder;convolutional code;data compression;forward error correction;interference (communication);mobile phone;requirement;turbo code	Friedbert Berens;Gerd Kreiselmaier;Norbert Wehn	2004	Proceedings Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition		concatenated error correction code;turbo equalizer;distributed source coding;turbo code;electronic engineering;convolutional code;error detection and correction;telecommunications;computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;forward error correction;statistics;computer network	EDA	44.14067984746609	67.07028513116879	79991

Synchronization is achieved and maintained through the code acquisition and the code tracking phase, respectively. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise and interuser interferences. Throughout, a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) is used as the synchronizing pilot signal within the multi-user chaotic communication system. In addition, the Logistic and Bernoulli chaotic maps are also used as the pilot signals in the investigation of the code acquisition performance. The code acquisition circuit is evaluated in terms of the probability of detection and probability of false alarm. The corresponding results demonstrate an ability to achieve initial synchronization. Furthermore, it is shown that in terms of code acquisition, the PRBS outperforms the Logistic and Bernoulli chaotic maps. A mathematical model of the code tracking loop is then presented. From the model, a control law for the generation of time offset estimates is derived. The robustness of the synchronization unit is then demonstrated in terms of the bit error rate. It has been shown that for the case of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 users, the bit error rate goes below the maximum acceptable limit of 10^-^3 at the bit energy to noise power spectral density ratio of approximately 8, 9, 9.5, 11, and 12dB, respectively. Furthermore, a gradual degradation in performance, above the maximum acceptable bit error rate limit, is demonstrated for the increasing number of users.	multi-user	Branislav Jovic;C. P.

Based on an actual optical binary phase shift keying (BPSK) code generation and processing system, the characteristics of devices in the code generation and processing with threshold processing were considered in this simulation. To handle variable BPSK codes, we used LiNbO3 (LN) modulators as an optical code generator and a transversal filter (TVF) as an optical code processor. We found that BPSK codes with 2–6 chips, 10, 20, 40 Gchip/s had sufficient threshold margins for code discrimination in the simulation, and this result was in good agreement with experimental results.

We show that space-time codes achieving full diversity in quasistatic flat fading environment can be used to construct space-frequency codes that can achieve the maximum diversity available in frequency-selective MIMO fading channels. Since the codes are constructed via a simple mapping from space-time codes to space-frequency codes, the abundant classes of existing space-time block and trellis codes can be used for full diversity transmission in MIMO-OFDM systems. The proposed mapping provides a tradeoff between the achieved diversity order and the symbol rate. Moreover, we characterize the performance of the space-frequency codes obtained via the mapping by finding lower and upper bounds on their coding advantages as functions of the coding advantages of the underlying space-time codes. This result will allow us to investigate the effects of the delay distribution and the power distribution of the channel impulse responses on the performance of the resulting space-frequency codes. Extensive simulation results are also presented to illustrate and support the theory.	convolutional code;frequency divider;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multiplexing;simplicial complex;simulation;trellis quantization	Weifeng Su;Zoltan Safar;Masoud Olfat;K.

d236b508cdfce9bbfe5cd5204d2bb9514c3241ee	performance bounds for quantized spatially coupled ldpc decoders based on absorbing sets		Absorbing sets are known to be the primary factor in the error-floor performance of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with message passing decoders over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Besides showing excellent waterfall performance, spatially coupled LDPC (SC-LDPC) codes that are constructed by an edge spreading technique are known to have fewer cycles and absorbing sets than their block code counterparts, and therefore to exhibit better error-floor performance. Based on our previously obtained results for quantized LDPC block decoders, we derive lower bounds on the performance of quantized SC-LDPC decoders, including both a flooding schedule decoder and a sliding window decoder. Numerical simulation results confirm the accuracy of the obtained bounds and show that, for quantized decoders, properly designed SC-LDPC codes have better error-floor performance than their underlying LDPC block codes.	additive white gaussian noise;block code;computer simulation;error floor;low-density parity-check code;message passing;quantization (signal processing);utility functions on indivisible goods	Homayoon Hatami;David G.

In these architectures the bottleneck for the parallelization of the decoder is the interleaver. On the other hand, turbo codes achieve a very impressive near Shannon-capacity performance in which the interleaver plays a crucial role. Therefore, it is of great interest to design interleaves that are good from both performance and parallelization point of views. In this paper we propose an interleaver structure that is very suitable for parallelization of turbo decoders. It is shown that such an interleaver can be designed to have good BER performance as well. By this structure not only fast decoders with very low latency can be built, but also the regularity of the decoder and the simplicity of the interleaver structure make them very promising for VLSI implementation. We also present a fast algorithm to design such an interleaver, which can be used to design S-random interleavers as well. Such interleavers have been designed and the performances are compared to that of S-random interleavers by simulations.	algorithm;channel capacity;forward error correction;parallel computing;performance;shannon (unit);simulation;turbo code;very-large-scale integration;x.690	Aliazam Abbasfar;Kung Yao	2004	2004 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (IEEE Cat.

Nevertheless, the bandwidth requirements for the proposed FPP schemes grow in a quadratic way, but not exponentially with the values of message bit numbers (k), which show obvious advantages over the bi-orthogonal scheme when k ≥ 6 at the expanse of little codeword error performance.	code word;cross-correlation;fixed-priority pre-emptive scheduling;requirement;waveform	Chien-Hsing Liao;Tai-Kuo Woo	2016	2016 22nd Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2016.7581492	electronic engineering;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Networks	42.14254878531629	69.50592125120131	81123

We develop techniques to compute the probability density function (pdf) of the extrinsic information at the output of the multiuser detector. We show that the output pdf can be modeled as symmetric Gaussian for synchronous CDMA in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and as a mixture of symmetric Gaussian densities for asynchronous CDMA system over fading channel. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm can be used to compute the parameters of this mixture. Using these techniques, we are able to accurately compute the thresholds for LDPC codes and design good irregular LDPC codes. Simulation results are in good agreement with the computed thresholds and the designed irregular LDPC codes outperform regular ones significantly.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;asynchronous system;cross-correlation;eb/n0;expectation–maximization algorithm;low-density parity-check code;multi-user;multipath propagation;parity bit;portable document format;simulation;synchronous circuit;utility functions on indivisible goods	Guosen Yue;Xiaodong Wang;Krishna R.

A new analytical methodology is then presented to evaluate automatic repeat request (ARQ) techniques, taking into account forward error correction (FEC) and nonideally interleaved SFH over Rayleigh fading channels. The selective-repeat (SR) ARQ and the type I hybrid ARQ/FEC techniques are compared when varying the number of bits per hop, thus gradually passing from the noninterleaved non-SFH case to the perfect interleaved case. It is found that the use of SFH and/or interleaving deteriorates the efficiency of the transmission: in other words, when ARQ is applied to slow fading channels the best performance is obtained without SFH and interleaving. The ARQ/FEC technique analyzed here gives marginal improvements with respect to pure SR only when perfect interleaving and SFH are applied.	error detection and correction;forward error correction;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hybrid automatic repeat request;marginal model;network packet;rayleigh fading;selective repeat arq;throughput	Marco Chiani	2000	IEEE Trans.

To implement a high-throughput decoder, a fully-parallel architecture can be adopted, but with complex interconnections. In order to reduce the routing complexity, a Split-Row Threshold decoder can be adopted. However, the high check-node degree of a high-rate LDPC code leads to a long critical path when using the Split-Row Threshold decoder. The long critical path can be shortened by using partially-parallel architectures combined with vertical scheduling. Two-phase message passing and shuffled message passing can be adopted in the vertical scheduling. The features of these state-of-the-art high-throughput decoder architectures and the associated comparison are presented in this paper.	clock rate;critical path method;elegant degradation;high-throughput computing;iteration;low-density parity-check code;message passing;parallel computing;routing;scheduling (computing);throughput;two-phase locking	Yeong-Luh Ueng;Chung-Chao Cheng	2012	2012 International SoC Design Conference (ISOCC)	10.1109/ISOCC.2012.6407112	parallel computing;soft-decision decoder;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	EDA	45.20259751629992	62.36326942761643	81847

The reason for this is that measurement equipment is expensive, difficult to obtain, and often inflexible when a multitude of transmission parameters are of interest. This paper presents a flexible testbed developed to examine MIMO algorithms and channel models described in literature by transmitting data at 2.45 GHz through real, physical channels, supporting simultaneously four transmit and four receive antennas. Operation is performed directly from Matlab allowing for a cornucopia of real-world experiments with minimum effort. Examples measuring bit error rates on space-time block codes are provided in the paper.	algorithm;bit error rate;code;experiment;matlab;mimo;mimo-ofdm;propagation constant;testbed;transmitter	Sebastian Caban;Christian Mehlführer;Robert Langwieser;Arpad L.

From the results, the probability of packet error in fast fading is higher than that in slow fading, and the difference of packet error probability between the fast fading and slow fading diminishes with Nakagami fading parameter approaching infinity. When the error correction coding technique is used, it is observed that coding technique for Multi-Carrier CDMA system is more effective in the fast fading case than that in the slow fading case.	bit error rate;interference (communication)	Jae-Sung Roh;Chang-Heon Oh;Heau-Jo Kang;Sung-Joon Cho	2002		10.1007/3-540-36087-5_43	fading distribution;error detection and correction;telecommunications;computer science;diversity scheme;mathematics;channel state information;fading;statistics	Mobile	42.36710830557787	73.9161178258661	82130
8b32f6cc4df8b5cf500286d562f64896ff21c417	correction trees as an alternative to turbo codes and low density parity check codes		The rapidly improving performance of modern hardware renders convolutional codes obsolete, and allows for the practical implementation of more sophisticated correction codes such as low density parity check (LDPC) and turbo codes (TC). Both are decoded by iterative algorithms, which require a disproportional computational effort for low channel noise. They are also unable to correct higher noise levels, still below the Shannon theoretical limit. In this paper, we discuss an enhanced version of a convolutional-like decoding paradigm which adopts very large spaces of possible system states, of the order of 2. Under such conditions, the traditional convolution operation is rendered useless and needs to be replaced by a carefully designed state transition procedure. The size of the system state space completely changes the correction philosophy, as state collisions are virtually impossible and the decoding procedure becomes a correction tree. The proposed decoding algorithm is practically cost-free for low channel noise. As the channel noise approaches the Shannon limit, it is still possible to perform correction, although its cost increases to infinity. In many applications, the implemented decoder can essentially outperform both LDPC and TC. This paper describes the proposed correction paradigm and theoretically analyzes the asymptotic correction performance. The considered encoder and decoder were verified experimentally for the binary symmetric channel. The correction process remains practically cost-free for channel error rates below 0.05 and 0.13 for the 1/2 and 1/4 rate codes, respectively. For the considered resource limit, the output bit error rates reach the order of 10−3 for channel error rates 0.08 and 0.18. The proposed correction paradigm can be easily extended to other communication channels; the appropriate generalizations are also discussed in this study.	algorithm;approximation;authentication;authorization;binary erasure channel;binary symmetric channel;bit error rate;code (cryptography);code rate;coefficient;computational complexity theory;computer data storage;convolution;convolutional code;digital recording;ecc memory;elegant degradation;encoder;error detection and correction;experiment;iso 10303;iteration;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;noise (electronics);pareto efficiency;parity bit;programming paradigm;real-time locating system;rendering (computer graphics);requirement;shannon (unit);shannon capacity of a graph;signal-to-noise ratio;state space;state transition table;time complexity;turbo code	Jaroslaw Duda;Pawel Korus	2012	CoRR		concatenated error correction code;turbo code;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;error detection and correction;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;mathematics;forward error correction;error floor;algorithm	ML	41.60501147122017	63.27359199824018	82309

Based on the truncated union bounds, various SECCCs can be designed for a desired BER floor without the need of time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations.	additive white gaussian noise;bit error rate;concatenation;convolutional code;exit chart;modulation;monte carlo method;rayleigh fading;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Soon Xin Ng;Muhammad Fasih Uddin Butt;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2009	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2009.2024784	additive white gaussian noise;convolutional code;bit error rate;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method	ML	41.76612586264968	72.66191831781552	82376

As reference oscillator stabilities improve and various frequency offsets decrease in networks involving several interfering spread-spectrum signals, the degree of carrier and code coherence increases. In this paper, data are presented showing more than a twentyfold increase in the time synchronization uncertainty (from 0.3 to 7 ns) due to interference of two spread-spectrum signals having a high degree of signal coherence.	data rate units;interference (communication);modulation;telecommunications network	David A Howe	1990	IEEE Trans.

However, it suffers great redundant computations resulting in high power consumption. In this paper, we conduct an improved algorithm for the original FSD by using early termination (ET). This algorithm (abbreviated as ET-FSD) preserves the advantages of sphere decoder (SD) such as branch pruning and an adaptively updated pruning threshold. We compare the ET-FSD with the original FSD and a lately developed statistical threshold-based FSD (ST-FSD). Simulation results demonstrate that the ET-FSD attains the same performance with a much lower cost than the FSD, and is much more efficient than the ST-FSD in practice. In addition, the statistical threshold-based method can also be used for the ET-FSD (i.e., ST-ET-FSD) to further reduce the complexity.	algorithm;computation;decoding methods;mimo;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Guanghui Li;Xin Zhang;Sheng Lei;Cong Xiong;Dacheng Yang	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214444	real-time computing;soft-decision decoder;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;iron;measurement;statistics;mimo	EDA	44.85318193500913	65.0906394252754	82798

The ranges of the differences between the path metrics, the soft output, and the complete information are derived. Since the Log-MAP algorithm is functionally dependent only upon the differences between path metrics, not their magnitudes, a modulo normalization technique that is automatically implemented in two’s complement arithmetic can be used to accommodate overflow of the path metrics. An expression for the minimum internal data width of a soft-input soft-output decoder that employs the modulo normalization technique is derived. As an application, the minimum internal data width of a decoder for the turbo code used in third-generation mobile communication systems is determined.	algorithm;functional dependency;modulo operation;numerical analysis;requirement;soft-in soft-out decoder;turbo code;two's complement	Yufei W.

The decision feedback-assisted RBF TEQ is capable of attaining a similar performance to the logarithmic maximum a posteriorischeme in the context of both binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) and quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation, while achieving a factor 2.5 and 3 lower computational complexity, respectively. However, there is a 2.5-dB performance loss in the context of 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), which suffers more dramatically from the phenomenon of erroneous decision-feedback effects. A novel element of our design, in order to further reduce the computational complexity of the RBF TEQ, is that symbol equalizations are invoked at current iterations only if the decoded symbol has a high error probability. This techniques provides 37% and 54% computational complexity reduction compared to the full-complexity RBF TEQ for the BPSK RBF TEQ and 16QAM RBF TEQ, respectively, with little performance degradation, when communicating over dispersive Rayleigh fading channels.	computational complexity theory;dispersive partial differential equation;elegant degradation;equalization (communications);iteration;key (cryptography);modulation;radial (radio);radial basis function network;rayleigh fading;reduction (complexity);structural complexity theory;trellis quantization;turbo equalizer	Mong-Suan Yee;Bee Leong Yeap;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2003	IEEE Trans.

Oversampled filter banks are currently being proposed for robust transmission applications, since added redundancy can be used for error recovery in case of losses. Error amplification is determined by the lower bound of the subframe resulting after losses. Theoretical expressions are derived to characterize such lower bound for different loss statistics. Criteria are derived that can be useful for the design of oversampled filter banks in various applications. The analysis and some application examples demonstrate that filter bank performance strongly depends on how the coefficients are organized into packets.	coefficient;filter bank;oversampling	Riccardo Bernardini;Roberto Rinaldo	2006	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2006.870632	telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;control theory;mathematics;statistics;source code	Visualization	39.86000468303472	68.30242120093936	83838

The PAPR problem is tackled by decomposing the circulant channel matrix into parallel channels by using DFT matrices in a Galois field of odd characteristic, rather than in a complex field. The modulo operation inherent to this field then limits the power of the modulated signal. More importantly, it is explained how this OFDM scheme can be seamlessly merged with a Reed-Solomon (RS) code, which due to its maximal Hamming distance is the preferred code for impulse noise cancellation. The overall scheme, referred to as RS-OFDM, shows an error correcting code that is matched to the OFDM-modulator. It is shown that the optimal Hamming distance of the RS code is preserved not only by the OFDM modulator, but also by the channel	circulant matrix;forward error correction;hamming distance;impulse noise (audio);maximal set;modulation;modulo operation;power architecture platform reference;reed–solomon error correction	Geert Van Meerbergen;Marc Moonen;Hugo De Man	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings	10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661054	arithmetic;constant-weight code;low-density parity-check code;telecommunications;hamming bound;computer science;cyclic code;linear code;hamming code;mathematics;reed–solomon error correction;statistics	HPC	45.643334036524735	68.49114468887296	83913
2e31107382aa855a62306cb805019fe80ac1ca19	design and analysis of unequal error protection rateless spinal codes		In this paper, we propose and analyze an unequal error protection (UEP) rateless spinal code, which can provide UEP and unequal recovery time properties. The proposed UEP spinal codes achieve UEP by the permutation of different priority levels and the setup of different segment sizes for different priority levels. In addition, an unequal length transmission scheme to improve the transmission rate is proposed, where the number of transmitted symbols in each pass varies. Moreover, we analyze the finite-length performance of the proposed UEP spinal code, which enables us to provide the upper bound of average error probability for each priority level under maximum likelihood decoding. Based on this finite-length result, we discuss the design of UEP spinal code, which is flexible and efficient. Furthermore, the asymptotic performance analysis shows that the proposed UEP spinal code with a practical decoder can achieve the capacities of both binary symmetric channel and additive white Gaussian noise channel. Simulation results verify our analysis.	additive white gaussian noise;alpha–beta pruning;binary symmetric channel;code;code word;decoding methods;google+;hash function;medical ultrasound;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Xiaopu Yu;Ying Li;Weiqiang Yang;Yue Sun	2016	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2606626	theoretical computer science;electronic engineering;computer science	Mobile	40.55287604809646	66.17063023703011	83938

The proposed BF algorithm which is called multi-threshold bit-flipping (MTBF) algorithm, flips multiple bits by using multiple thresholds at each iteration. It only requires some real operations before iterations and requires only logical operations during the iterations. The MTBF algorithm has lower complexity than the weighted bit-flipping algorithm and its modifications. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm has fast convergence speed and good performance.	algorithm;brainfuck;computer simulation;iteration;logical connective;low-density parity-check code;mean time between failures	Yuan-hua Liu;Xin Liang Niu;Mei Ling Zhang	2015	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2373352	list decoding;discrete mathematics;sequential decoding;theoretical computer science;bcjr algorithm;mathematics;iterative method;berlekamp–welch algorithm;error floor;algorithm	ML	42.989746819373174	60.88186408736632	83946

The proposed algorithms halve iteration cycles and arrange variables more flexibly and effectively. The first simplified algorithm reduces about 1/3 fewer process elements and registers, while the second requires only one half of gate counts compared to the original riBM algorithm. Also folded architectures can be adopted because both of the two optimized algorithms are symmetrical and regular.	bch code;berlekamp–massey algorithm;iteration;mathematical optimization;reed–solomon error correction	Min Yin;Menwang Xie;Min Huang	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS2013)	10.1109/ISCAS.2013.6572155	block code;arithmetic;binary code;computer science;theoretical computer science;bcjr algorithm;tornado code;maxeksat;linear code;mathematics;chien search;bch code;berlekamp–welch algorithm;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;algorithm	Arch	43.60174130995402	60.47801229442146	84164
f33ffb02f8783a2629731bb6552da61a7311d75d	low complexity hybrid arq using extended turbo product codes self-detection		This paper presents a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) system using a parity error checking (PEC) technique with low processing power requirements. The proposed technique is applied to extended turbo product codes (TPC) where the parity check bits used for extending the component codes of TPC, are exploited to replace the conventional cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error detection in HARQ systems. Consequently, the required processing power can be reduced substantially while the throughput is almost unchanged for long TPC codes, or increased for short TPC codes. The proposed PEC technique is also compared to the state-of-the-art syndrome error checking (SEC) as well as conventional CRC. Monte Carlo simulation results reveal that PEC- HARQ can provide equivalent throughput to SEC-HARQ and higher throughput than CR-HARQ systems. Moreover, numerical results show that the PEC technique has lower computational complexity than both SEC and CRC error detection. In particular cases, the complexity of the proposed system is reduced by more than 50% as compared to the state- of-the-art, and by more than 80% when compared to the CRC error detection.	code;computational complexity theory;cyclic redundancy check;error detection and correction;hybrid automatic repeat request;ibm tivoli storage productivity center;monte carlo method;network packet;numerical analysis;parity bit;requirement;simulation;throughput	Husameldin Mukhtar;Arafat J.

The design is developed for the two standard schemes for eliminating inter-block interference; viz, zero padding (ZP) and cyclic prefix (CP). The CP minimum BER precoder has a structure similar to that of the conventional water-filling discrete multitone (DMT) modulation scheme, but the diagonal water-filling power loading matrix is replaced by a full matrix consisting of a diagonal minimum mean square error (MMSE) power loading matrix post-multiplied by a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrix. The ZP minimum BER precoder has a corresponding structure. Performance evaluations indicate that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of the ZP and CP minimum BER precoders over conventional water-filling DMT, MMSE, and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) schemes can be as much as several decibels.	bit error rate;dft matrix;decibel;digital monetary trust;discrete fourier transform;frequency divider;interference (communication);mean squared error;modulation;multiplexing;signal-to-noise ratio;viz: the computer game;x.690	Yanwu Ding;Timothy N.

This problem has been formulated as an instance of the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) and solved using the Reactive Tabu Search (RTS). In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm for solving the symbol labeling problem and show that it usually yields designs that are isomorphic to those obtained using RTS. We then extend the algorithm to optimize not only the labelings of the signal points, but also their location in the signal space. Using this approach, new constellations of cardinality 16, 32, and 64 are evolved that have an error floor lower than that of QAM or PSK modulation. The new constellations exhibit gains of 1.32 and 0.88 dB over the best 16-QAM and 64-QAM constellations reported previously.	bit numbering;error floor;evolutionary computation;genetic algorithm;iteration;modulation;pre-shared key;quadratic assignment problem;signal-to-noise ratio;tabu search	Matthew C.

First, we propose the SSFE (selective spanning with fast enumeration) algorithm as an architecture friendly near-ML MIMO detector. The SSFE has a distributed and greedy algorithmic structure that brings a completely deterministic and regular dataflow. This enables efficient parallelization on programmable architectures. More importantly, in order to exploit the abundant flexibility enabled by programmable architectures, we propose an efficient online algorithm to adaptively adjust the search range of the SSFE according to the numerical properties of MIMO channel matrixes. Such adaptiveness brings significant throughput improvements at negligible performance degradations. Specifically, on VLIW DSP TI TMS320C6416, such a dynamic adaptation brings 2.62 times to 28.6 times improvements (comparing to the static SSFE) for 1/2 turbo-coded 4 times 4 64 QAM transmissions over 3GPP suburban macro channels, delivering 80 - 103 Mbps average throughput.	baseband;central processing unit;data rate units;dataflow;digital signal processor;file spanning;fixed point (mathematics);geforce 900 series;greedy algorithm;mimo;numerical analysis;objective-c;online algorithm;opcode;parallel computing;simd;throughput;vector processor;very long instruction word	Min Li;Bruno Bougard;David Novo;Wim Van Thillo;Liesbet Van der Perre;Francky Catthoor	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.632	digital signal processor;turbo code;parallel computing;real-time computing;simd;telecommunications;computer science;very long instruction word;statistics	Visualization	45.584371647613054	63.20155835674731	85507

However, a clipping is a nonlinear process that may lead to significant distortion and performance loss. An iterative time-domain decision-aided clipping compensation framework is proposed to mitigate the distortion caused by the intentional clipping with the additional constraint of out-of-band noise filtering, and it is compared with the existing frequency-domain scheme. It incorporates the simple additive distortion model and the minimum mean-square distortion (MMSD) model, with the options of hard and soft symbol estimation. Extensive simulation results are provided for the performance comparison among different schemes. The MMSD-distortion-model-based frequency-domain clipping compensation gives the best performance and is applied to scalable video transmission with a multiband OFDM.

For such channels, the nonlinear Fourier transform, a powerful tool in soliton theory and exactly solvable models, plays the same role in “diagonalizing” the channel that the ordinary Fourier transform plays for linear convolutional channels. A transmission strategy encoding information in the nonlinear Fourier spectrum, termed nonlinear frequency-division multiplexing, is proposed for integrable channels that is the nonlinear analogue of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing commonly used in linear channels. A central and motivating example is fiber-optic data transmission, for which the proposed transmission technique deals with both dispersion and nonlinearity directly and unconditionally without the need for dispersion or nonlinearity compensation methods.	convolution;decision problem;fourier analysis;motion compensation;multiplexing;nonlinear system;optical fiber;scheme;soliton;nftables	Mansoor I.

We use a joint packet coding where the same channel block is logically shared among many packets. To reduce the encoding and decoding complexity, we use a two-layer coding where, first, packets are punctured, mixed, and then passed to the conventional channel encoder. We show how to optimize the puncturing rates on the basis of the empirical error-rate curves. We also discuss how the parameters of the practical turbo-codes may be modified to take advantage of the proposed HARQ scheme. Finally, simple and pragmatic rate adaptation strategies are developed. In numerical examples, our scheme is compared with the conventional incremental redundancy HARQ (IR-HARQ), which remains a strategy of choice in the region of small throughput; however, our scheme shows a notable gain of  $1-2~\textrm {dB}$  in the region of high throughput, where IR-HARQ fails to provide any improvement.	approximation algorithm;catastrophic interference;channel state information;coding theory;design rationale;encoder;error detection and correction;hybrid automatic repeat request;interference (communication);markov chain;markov decision process;network packet;numerical analysis;puncturing;throughput;transmitter;turbo code	Mohammed Jabi;Etienne Pierre-Doray;Leszek Szczecinski;Mustapha Benjillali	2017	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2682088	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	40.536900589058725	66.94956718329118	85794
1975c1da8a2504c89bbd0e3d2c2d3873aee52152	rateless codes based on punctured polar codes		Polar codes are the first binary linear block codes provably achieving the symmetric capacity of arbitrary binary-input discrete memoryless channels. However, in their original design, their block length is limited to integer powers of two, a constraint that may be relaxed by puncturing. In this work, a novel construction of rateless codes based on punctured polar codes is presented, that is, codes that offer flexible rates via length adaption for a fixed dimension. While the approach presented relies on puncturing, it may be based on arbitrary puncturing methods. The rateless codes obtained work with standard polar code encoders and decoders, and allow for ad-hoc switching of the code rate without additional overhead.	binary decoder;block code;code (cryptography);code rate;computer simulation;cyclic redundancy check;encoder;hoc (programming language);linear code;overhead (computing);polar code (coding theory);power of two;puncturing;signal-to-noise ratio;structured text	Christopher Schnelling;Markus Rothe;Rudolf Mathar;Anke Schmeink	2018	2018 15th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2018.8491237	kernel (linear algebra);real-time computing;encoder;discrete mathematics;decoding methods;polar code;computer science;linear code;puncturing;code rate;communication channel	Theory	39.90210547372606	64.5650080040373	86009

Nevertheless, these results have been fairly poor so far. The need to investigate fundamental limitations on the decoder’s performance under a desynchronization attack is thus clear. In this paper, we look at the class of estimator-decoders which estimate the desynchronization attack parameter(s) for using in the decoding step. We model the desynchronization attack as an arbitrary (but invertible) linear time-invariant (LTI) system. We then come up with an encoding-decoding scheme for these attacks on cubic QIM watermarking schemes, and derive Cramér-Rao bounds on the estimation error for the desynchronization parameter at the decoder. As an example, we consider the case of a cyclic shift attack and present some numerical findings.	algorithm;circular shift;computation;cubic function;digital watermarking;estimation theory;line code;linear time-invariant theory;modulation;numerical analysis;time complexity;time-invariant system	Shankar Sadasivam;Pierre Moulin	2007		10.1117/12.705481	speech recognition;theoretical computer science;accuracy and precision	ML	52.53611770655419	71.4034273737772	86144

In this paper, a blind C&F scheme - i.e., one not requiring CSI - is developed. Rather than attempting to compute the optimal scale factor, this new scheme seeks one (or more) “good” scalars, i.e., scalars which allow correct decoding despite possibly being sub-optimal. The region of all such good scalars is characterized. To find a good scalar, a computationally efficient scheme, involving error-detection and a hierarchically organized list, is proposed. Simulation results show that this blind C&F scheme achieves - for a class of lattices admitting an efficient trellis decoder - the same throughput as its CSI-enabled counterpart, at the expense of, approximately, a ten-fold increase in computational complexity in the high-throughput region.	algorithmic efficiency;channel state information;computational complexity theory;high-throughput computing;simulation;throughput;trellis quantization	Chen Feng;Danilo Silva;Frank R.

Modeling the channel using the continuous-fading model, a matrix state-space model, which naturally represents the temporal and spatial dimensions of a MIMO system, is introduced. A consistent and novel matrix CE/DD scheme is developed using a matrix Kalman filter and a matrix normalized-innovations-based maximum-likelihood detector. In MIMO CE/DD in multiplicative fading, symmetric STBCs (S-STBCs) cause isometric data sequences, which lead to a detection error floor. Motivated by the minimization of the probability of error, two asymmetric STBCs are introduced to be used with these S-STBCs to mitigate isometry. To further improve detection performance, a self-matching STBC (SM-STBC), which mitigates isometry using asymmetry, improves estimation performance using training, and improves detection performance by adapting its code properties, is introduced. This SM-STBC generalizes a limited version that was previously proposed. A comprehensive analysis, which is supported by some simulation studies, indicates that the proposed framework of transceiver and STBC designs offers excellent detection performance.	block code;channel state information;characteristic function (convex analysis);dd (unix);embedded system;emoticon;error floor;feedback;isometric projection;kalman filter;mimo;modulation;performance;rayleigh fading;recursion;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;simulation interoperability standards organization;state space;transceiver;transmitter;unified framework	Stephen Lam;Konstantinos N.

For high throughput applications, efficient parallel Turbo-decoder architectures are the key. In this paper, two fundamentally different parallel architectural approaches in terms of performance and implementation complexity were compared. Both architectures exploit the well known windowing scheme. The first architecture template processes several windows in parallel. Each window is executed on a serial Log-MAP decoder which produces one value per clock cycle. In contrast, the second architecture sequentially processes the individual windows on a fast monolithic pipelined MAP decoder which produces several values per clock cycle and is memory-optimized. This is, to the best of the author's knowledge, the first comparison of this totally different architectural approach for high throughput Turbo-decoder architectures. The 3GPP conditions for performance comparisons were applied.	clock signal;dataflow;error detection and correction;forward error correction;map;microsoft windows;pipeline (computing);throughput;turbo code;whole earth 'lectronic link	Matthias May;Christian Neeb;Norbert Wehn	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378627	turbo code;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;statistics	Arch	45.1448606795432	62.60757432983585	86386

The codes are systematic, require no decoding and allow for simple encoding. They operate by prohibiting the occurrence of harmful symbol patterns. On some discrete-time communication channels, the (n, n - 1) PEC can prohibit all occurrences of symbol patterns causing worst- case ISI. The effectiveness of a PEC is shown to be uniquely determined by the sign-signature of the channel response, and a simple criterion is given for identifying channels for which the (n, n - 1) code is effective. It is also shown that for most channel signatures, the (n, n - 1) PEC can be augmented by a (O, n - 1) runlength-limiting (RLL) code at no additional coding overhead. This paper also explores properties of the (n, n-b) PEC for b > 1. The simulation results show that the (n, n - 1) PEC can provide error-rate reductions of several orders of magnitude, even with rate penalty taken into account. It is also shown that channel conditioning, such as equalization, can have a large effect on the code performance and potentially large gains can be derived from optimizing the equalizer jointly with a pattern-eliminating code.	code;electronic signature;emoticon;equalization (communications);information sciences institute;interference (communication);overhead (computing);simulation	Natasa Blitvic;Lizhong Zheng;Vladimir Stojanovic	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.237	block code;discrete time and continuous time;equalization;channel code;telecommunications;word error rate;computer science;intersymbol interference;statistics;channel	HPC	44.198038434620535	74.37570096393219	86436

In this paper, we also consider asynchronous cooperative communications where the channels are assumed to be frequency-selective fading. We design high rate distributed space-frequency codes to achieve both full asynchronous cooperative diversity and multipath diversities.	code;computer simulation;multipath propagation;relay	Yabo Li;Wei Zhang;Xiang-Gen Xia	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.110	number theory;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;cooperative diversity;space–time code;statistics	Mobile	43.57036687801342	74.37098409830656	86523

Iterative and joint iterative systems using LDPC, turbo codes or the turbo principle with a convolutional code, show excellent bit error rate performance and approach the Shannon limit as the code length is increased.

However, the large code length required by practical applications leads to high decoding latency because the conventional successive cancellation (SC) decoder decodes bits serially. This brief first reviews the conventional SC decoder briefly. An improved SC decoder architecture is given, which reduces the decoding latency by 25% compared to the conventional one. Then a stage-reduced SC decoding algorithm and its low-latency architecture is presented. Compared with the conventional SC decoder, the proposed stage-reduced SC decoder achieves almost 50% latency reduction with no performance degradation and acceptable hardware overhead. A kind of 2-stage-reduced SC decoding algorithm is also investigated in this brief.	algorithm;elegant degradation;overhead (computing);polar code (coding theory)	Xing Liu;Jin Sha;Chuan Zhang;Zhongfeng Wang	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)	10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251871	list decoding;electronic engineering;real-time computing;soft-decision decoder;telecommunications;sequential decoding;computer science;viterbi decoder	HPC	44.20622953083466	62.9906393734162	86805

Initially, space-time codes were designed to achieve one of these two types of gain. Recently, though, a tradeoff between these two system resources has been characterized by the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. Achieving this optimal performance frontier requires proper coding. For diversity optimality, the signal transmitted from each antenna must redundantly describe the message bits. This redundancy has been quantified by the rate of a space-time code, which relates space-time codebook size to constituent single-input-single-output (SISO) constellation size. Achievable diversity has also been shown to decrease with increasing rates, which establishes the diversity-rate tradeoff. In this work, we consider a generalized notion of the rate of the space-time code, which we refer to as the code rate Rc, and the associated diversity-code rate tradeoff. We then generalize the diversity-multiplexing and diversity-code rate tradeoffs and find that a new diversity-multiplexing tradeoff exists as a function of the code rate.	channel capacity;code rate;codebook;mimo;multiplexing;reed–solomon error correction;signal-to-noise ratio;soft-in soft-out decoder;uncompressed video	Erik Stauffer;Djordje Tujkovic;Arogyaswami Paulraj	2009	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2008.2008127	telecommunications;code rate;control theory;mathematics;space–time code;statistics	Mobile	40.71479041534396	71.57780561793679	86884

The phase estimation is implemented with the aid of the extrinsic information from the turbo decoder. A series of look-up tables are pre-computed to reduce the computation complexity, and thereby we avoid introducing delay to the decoding. Simulations are carried out both in BPSK and QPSK systems. If the block size is 1024, a phase error up to 82/spl deg/ in a BPSK system, and up to 37/spl deg/ in a QPSK system can be removed completely. Compared with the conventional method, which has separate phase recovery and decoding, this approach exhibits a great improvement. The effect of block size is also considered. The results demonstrate that the longer the block size, the better the performance.	quantum phase estimation algorithm	Li X. Zhang;Alister G.

Multilevel amplitude-shift keying (ASK) and a receiver consisting of an optical channel selection filter (specifically, a single-stage Fabry-Perot), a pin diode for direct detection, and an integrator are assumed. It is also assumed that additive noise is negligible and that the major impairments are adjacent channel interference and intersymbol interference. The analysis shows that, for such a receiver, there is no advantage to going beyond binary signaling. It is also shown that this finding holds up when additive and phase noises and alternative approaches to filtering are considered. >	amplitude-shift keying;cell signaling;finite difference method;spectral efficiency	Leonard J.

61802eb1d5a5ef173c00caf0c129aebeb7dbbc21	complex block floating-point format with box encoding for wordlength reduction in communication systems		We propose a new complex block floating-point format to reduce implementation complexity. The new format achieves wordlength reduction by sharing an exponent across the block of samples, and uses box encoding for the shared exponent to reduce quantization error. Arithmetic operations are performed on blocks of samples at time, which can also reduce implementation complexity. For a case study of a baseband quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) transmitter and receiver, we quantify the tradeoffs in signal quality vs. implementation complexity using the new approach to represent IQ samples. Signal quality is measured using error vector magnitude (EVM) in the receiver, and implementation complexity is measured in terms of arithmetic complexity as well as memory allocation and memory input/output rates. The primary contributions of this paper are (1) a complex block floating-point format with box encoding of the shared exponent to reduce quantization error, (2) arithmetic operations using the new complex block floatingpoint format, and (3) a QAM transceiver case study to quantify signal quality vs. implementation complexity tradeoffs using the new format and arithmetic operations.

17b7716a5a2b1a3d99879a1e94c2da7751ceac13	interleaver design for ldpc-partial polar codes based on exit analysis		The concatenation of polar codes with LDPC codes is a promising approach to enhance the performance of polar codes at finite lengths while suppressing the error floor of LDPC codes. The polarized bit-channels of polar coding at finite lengths exhibit different qualities, i.e., some are almost noiseless while others are noisy. This implies that unbalanced protection is needed in the design of concatenating polar codes with other codes. To this end, a scheme of concatenatng polar codes with outer irregular LDPC codes for the protection of intermediate channels of polar codes is proposed in this paper. Between two constituent codes, a specifically designed interleaver is employed such that the overall error probability is minimized. The extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) analysis and a low-complexity heuristic method are proposed for the interleaver design.

On these channels, a particular transmission may encounter no errors. Hence, it is desirable to split an encoded sequence into subsequences that are sent in successive transmissions such that each subsequence contains all the information necessary to recover the original message in case of no errors. When errors are present, the subsequences are combined to perform error correction. We show that invertible convolutional codes have this property, and can be used to provide incremental redundancy in a variable-redundancy hybrid ARQ (VR-HARQ) scheme. Invertible convolutional codes provide an alternative to polynomial division otherwise required to extract the original message in convolutional VR-HARQ schemes. >	convolutional code;hybrid automatic repeat request	Ajay Dholakia;Mladen A.

The delayed stochastic decoding uses an alternative method to track probability values, which results in reduction of hardware complexity and memory requirement of the stochastic decoders. It is therefore suitable for fully-parallel implementation of long LDPC codes with applications in optical communications. Two decoders are implemented using the DS algorithm for medium (2048, 1723) and long (32768, 26624) LDPC codes. The decoders occupy 3.93- mm2 and 56.5- mm2 silicon area using 90-nm CMOS technology and provide maximum core throughputs of 172.4 and 477.7 Gb/s at [(Eb)/(No)]=5.5 and 4.8 dB, respectively.	algorithm;binary decoder;cmos;gigabyte;low-density parity-check code;parity bit;requirement;throughput	Ali Naderi;Shie Mannor;Mohamad Sawan;Warren J.

In some applications, such as digital mobile communications, this issue can be important. Accordingly, this paper examines the effect of feedback errors on the throughputs of the stop-and-wait (SW), go-back-N (GBN), and selective repeat (SR) ARQ protocols for the case of a point-to-point channel under some feedback information assumptions. It is shown that the deleterious effects of feedback errors on the throughputs of continuous (e.g., GBN and SR) ARQ protocols can be greatly reduced by a simple modification in the retransmission operation, provided that the “complete state” of the receiver is sent back with each acknowledgment.	acknowledgment index;automatic repeat request;feedback;fibre channel point-to-point;go-back-n arq;retransmission (data networks);selective repeat arq;shattered world;throughput	Richard Cam;Cyril Leung	1997	IEEE Trans.

We derive an upper bound on the pairwise word error probability (PWEP) of space-time codes and use it as a basis for a unified approach to analysis and design of space-time codes over any flat, Rician or Rayleigh, block-fading channel. Based on the statistical properties of a Rician channel, the high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) behavior of the bound is either exponential or rational. In the former case, design criteria for space-time codes are based on a Euclidean-distance-like measure. However, in the latter case, design criteria are based on a rank criterion together with a coding gain criterion. The analysis of the bound shows that the performance of rank-deficient codes can be highly degraded in the presence of spatio-temporal correlation, but the performance degradation is not severe for full-rank codes. These codes exhibit robustness against the channel correlation profile. Specifically, for channels with a nonsingular covariance matrix, the asymptotic performance of a full-rank code is proportional to its performance in the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) case. In the case that the only constraint on the codewords is a maximum energy constraint, we show that the set of rank-deficient codes forms a proper algebraic subset of measure zero in the affine space of space-time codes. Thus, any randomly selected code is full rank with probability one. Hence, in this case, the main challenge in space-time coding is not maximizing diversity but optimizing coding gain. However, optimizing the coding gain is computationally hard and there exists no satisfactory algorithm to solve this problem in general. On the other hand, when we constrain codewords to be from a finite alphabet or to satisfy particular algebraic structures, e.g., group codes, lattice codes, or coset codes, the problem might be tractable, but rank-deficient codes might be highly probable at high spectral efficiency.	algorithm;cobham's thesis;code word;coding gain;eisenstein's criterion;elegant degradation;euclidean distance;linear algebra;randomness;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;time complexity	Majid Fozunbal;Steven W.

To obtain an unbiased comparison of different ARQ schemes a theoretical viewpoint is adopted. More precisely, the sphere-packing bound is used to evaluate the best possible performance of a hybrid ARQ scheme. To assess the correctness and the accuracy of the analysis, some simulation results, based on the use of turbo codes, are also presented. The results highlight the relative merits and drawbacks of the investigated hybrid ARQ schemes, some of which are under evaluation for the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) standard.	hybrid automatic repeat request	Fulvio Babich	2001		10.1109/ICC.2001.937230	turbo code;hybrid automatic repeat request;error detection and correction;selective repeat arq;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;forward error correction;markov process;automatic repeat request;statistics;computer network	Crypto	41.35085430943063	70.84882341600898	89104

Space-time block code (STBC), space-frequency block code (SFBC), and space-time-frequency (STF) block code are well-known techniques in transmitter diversity schemes. While the SFBC (or the STF block coded) system gives full diversity at frequency-nonselective channels, it breaks down when used in a frequency-selective environment. This is because the SFBC (or the STF block code) scheme disregards frequency selectivity of the channel by assuming that channel frequency responses (CFRs) at adjacent subcamers are the same. In this paper, we propose efficient channel estimation and symbol decoding methods, which consider the difference between CFRs at the adjacent subcamers of the SFBC (or the STF block coded) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system in multipath fading channels. The proposed method gives initial channel information by designing a simple training symbol, and the CFRs at all the subcarriers and the differences between the CFRs are easily calculated by using an interpolation method or a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) operation.	channel state information;multipath propagation	Hui-Chul Won;Gi-Hong Im	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e88-b.5.2093	telecommunications;interpolation;computer science;statistics	Mobile	49.74652251521815	73.00530509883932	89130
dbf733f21b768cedbd28bd3154b5f30559f29e92	proactive channel adjustment to improve polar code capability for flash storage devices		With the low encoding/decoding complexity and the high error correction capability, polar code with the support of list-decoding and cyclic redundancy check can outperform LDPC code in the area of data communication. Thus, it also draws a lot of attentions on how to adopt and enable polar codes in storage applications. However, the code construction and encoding length limitation issues obstruct the adoption of polar codes in flash storage devices. To enable polar codes in flash storage devices, we propose a proactive channel adjustment design to extend the effective time of a code construction to improve the error correction capability of polar codes. This design pro-actively tunes the quality of the critical flash cells to maintain the correctness of the code construction and relax the constraint of the encoding length limitation, so that polar codes can be enabled in flash storage devices. A series of experiments demonstrates that the proposed design can effectively improve the error correction capability of polar codes in flash storage devices.	flash memory;polar code (coding theory);proactive parallel suite	Kun-Cheng Hsu;Che-Wei Tsao;Yuan-Hao Chang;Tei-Wei Kuo;Yu-Ming Huang	2018		10.1109/DAC.2018.8465820	cyclic redundancy check;bit error rate;real-time computing;error detection and correction;low-density parity-check code;decoding methods;polar code;computer science;communication channel;flash memory	EDA	43.37872375221113	63.50269278452464	89284

We consider outer nonrecursive convolutional and inner recursive space-time trellis code case and iterative decoding based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm. The performance is evaluated by means of computer simulations and it is observed that when the recursive versions of some of the previously known space-time trellis codes are used as the inner codes, the Euclidean distance criterion based space-time codes lead to better error performance for both quasi-static and rapid fading channels. We also investigate the effects of various system parameters on the performance. We obtain the error performance for the large number of transmit and/or receive antennas and observe that, generally, as the number of antennas increases the error performance improves.	algorithm;computer simulation;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;convolutional code;euclidean distance;iteration;iterative method;rayleigh fading;recursion;ruby document format;trellis quantization	Ibrahim Altunbas;Abbas Yongaçoglu	2003		10.1109/ISCC.2003.1214133	computer simulation;concatenated error correction code;convolutional code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;space time;euclidean distance;space–time code;error floor;fading;statistics	Robotics	44.50860060838102	72.2709469476574	89314

However, different applications of LDPC codes (e.g. wireless sensor networks) impose different sets of constraints which include speed, bit error rates (BER) and energy efficiency. Our previous work reported an algorithmic framework for designing margin propagation (MP) based LDPC decoders where the BER performance can be traded off with its energy efficiency. In this paper we present an analog current-mode implementation of an MP-based (32; 8) LDPC decoder. The implementation uses only addition, subtraction and threshold operations and hence is independent of transistor biasing and robust to variations in environmental conditions (e.g. temperature). Measured results from prototypes fabricated in a 0.5µm CMOS process verify the functionality of a (32; 8) LDPC decoder and demonstrate superior BER performance compared to the state-of-the-art analog min-sum decoder at SNR greater than 3.5 dB.	algorithm;analog signal;belief propagation;benchmark (computing);biasing;bit error rate;cmos;emoticon;interval propagation;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;maxima and minima;qr code;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;transistor;x.690	Ming Gu;Shantanu Chakrabartty	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937813	electronic engineering;real-time computing;low-density parity-check code;wireless sensor network;soft-decision decoder;computer science;theoretical computer science;statistics	Arch	44.411336372645025	64.1324776353814	89579

In the first technique, we use the binary parity check matrix proposed in the IEEE 802.16 standard, and propose a novel parity check matrix for LDPC codes over GF(4) with the non-zero entries chosen to maximize the entropy. We show that our proposed code outperforms the binary code proposed in the IEEE 802.16 standard over both AWGN and SUI-3 channel model. In our second technique, we use a high rate LDPC code, in a concatenated coding structure, as an outer code, with a convolutional code as an inner code. We compare the performance of such a concatenated code with the commonly used one utilizing Reed-Solomon codes over the standard SUI-3 channel model, and show better performance.	adaptive system;additive white gaussian noise;binary code;binary symmetric channel;channel (communications);concatenated error correction code;concatenation;convolutional code;folded reed–solomon code;low-density parity-check code;mathematical optimization;parity bit;parity-check matrix;qr code	Khaled ElMahgoub;Mohammed Nafie	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.117	block code;systematic code;multidimensional parity-check code;polynomial code;concatenated error correction code;prefix code;turbo code;convolutional code;constant-weight code;low-density parity-check code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;repetition code;cyclic code;serial concatenated convolutional codes;linear code;hamming code;forward error correction;raptor code;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;statistics	Visualization	42.9276895246379	67.36101735425646	89624

Such modulations have been adopted in the satellite broadcasting standards since they have a significant advantage over commonly used square-type quadrature amplitude modulations; their signals exhibit lower peak-to-average power ratio and thus enhance the power amplifier efficiency at the transmitter. A common low-complexity approach for decoding of MLC is the multi-stage decoding (MSD). However, MSD in general leads to severe latency at the decoder since the binary decisions on the higher levels should wait for those of the lower levels. Furthermore, this latency issue is even more salient for APSK signaling due to its circular nature of constellations that does not allow its decomposition into in-phase and quadrature components (i.e., I-Q decomposition). Therefore, in this paper we introduce a new MLC design for APSK that enables the decoder to reduce its latency without any increase in terms of complexity. The proposed approach consists of a novel labeling with an unconventional set partitioning that allows the detector to make use of I-Q decomposition. Specifically, the proposed set partitioning results in a quadrature-PSK constellation at the penultimate level, which can be decomposed into a pair of separately decodable binary-PSK constellations at the final level. The resulting decoder consists of a combination of MSD and parallel independent decoding that can be implemented with lower latency. The simulation results together with the theoretical analyses demonstrate that the reduction of not only the decoding latency but also the complexity in bit metric calculation can be achieved without noticeable degradation in terms of error performance compared to the conventional set partitioning approach.	audio power amplifier;elegant degradation;in-phase and quadrature components;key (cryptography);modulation;multi-level cell;pre-shared key;simulation;transmitter	Daiki Yoda;Hideki Ochiai	2015	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2015.2492471	turbo code;electronic engineering;real-time computing;quadrature amplitude modulation;telecommunications;amplitude and phase-shift keying;computer science	EDA	45.59321964555159	66.2359283933559	89969

It has been observed recently that in contrast with the other MIMO receivers, the MMSE receiver has a diversity depending on the finite target rate, and that for sufficiently low rates the MMSE receiver reaches the full diversity - that is, the diversity of the ML receiver. This behavior has so far only been partially explained. The purpose of this paper is to provide complete proofs for flat fading MIMO channels, and to improve the partial existing results in frequency selective MIMO channels with cyclic prefix.	mimo	Florian Dupuy;Philippe Loubaton	2011	2011 Conference Record of the Forty Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (ASILOMAR)	10.1109/ACSSC.2011.6190146	telecommunications;diversity scheme;mathematics;radio receiver;fading	Networks	40.360607458408424	73.88436012238432	90266

Significantly, the TDE supports both single carrier (SC) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) operation modes for digital baseband receiver. In order to improve the performance, the proposed TDE adopts Golay sequence aided one-shot channel estimation and modified multi-path interference cancellation (MPIC) equalization. Targeting on the line-of-sight (LOS) channel characteristic, MPIC is simplified with single-tap for complexity reduction. From the area efficiency point of view, both SC and OFDM modes are designed within a single hardware to yield 99% of area sharing. The Golay-MPIC TDE structure is realized as feed-forward data path with 8X-parallelism to achieve 2.64 GS/s at 330 MHz clock rate. The Golay-MPIC TDE is fabricated as a part of a digital baseband with 65 nm 1P9M general purpose process. The area of Golay-MPIC TDE occupies 1.05 mm2 with 405 K gate counts. Besides, the power dissipations for SC and ODFM modes are 56.71 mW@220 MHz (1 V) and 91.29 mW@330 MHz (1.1 V), respectively. Finally, the chip can provide the maximum throughput 15.84 Gb/s (2.64 GS/s with 64-QAM modulation).	adobe framemaker;algorithm;baseband;binary golay code;channel state information;clock rate;computational complexity theory;cost efficiency;equalization (communications);gigabyte;interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);maximum throughput scheduling;modulation;multiplexing;parallel computing;performance prediction;point of view (computer hardware company);radio frequency;reduction (complexity);roland gs;simulation;transparent data encryption;x.690	Wei-Chang Liu;Fu-Chun Yeh;Ting-Chen Wei;Ching-Da Chan;Shyh-Jye Jou	2013	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2013.2244321	electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science	EDA	47.16947745021661	64.53180657802426	90500

To assist this iterative scheme, a new log-likelihood ratio (LLR) metric based on three consecutive received symbols is derived. This metric takes a priori information of other coded bits into account and therefore applicable to the proposed iterative scheme. We show that the proposed iterative scheme has better performance than systems using other LLR metrics for noncoherent detections. The performance of the proposed scheme under signal-to-noise ratio estimation error is also investigated.	approximation;carrier recovery;coherence (physics);concatenation;convolutional code;differential phase;encoder;iteration;iterative method;key (cryptography);low-density parity-check code;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;marginal model;modulation;parity bit;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Jianwen Zhang;Pooi Yuen Kam	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962726	convolutional code;low-density parity-check code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	43.92018779249394	68.91333270223406	90564

The GP-extended FIR predictor has been implemented on Altera’s programmable logic devices, and its performance has been simulated with varying bit widths. The hardware implementation takes advantage of the characteristic properties of programmable logic devices. This results in decreasing the required number of logic gates and in increasing the maximum sampling rate of the predictor. The proposed adaptation can be regarded as the simplest form of adaptive filtering, and is shown to yield improved filtering performance at a low computational cost. A promising application is to use the GP-extended FIR filter in predicting the received transmission power in a WCDMA mobile communications system.	adaptive filter;algorithmic efficiency;coefficient;computation;finite impulse response;kerrison predictor;logic gate;polynomial;programmable logic device;sampling (signal processing)	Matti Tommiska;Jarno M.

We evaluate the bit-error probabilities of the coded systems, taking into account the photodetector noise, thermal noise, and the multiple-access interference. In this paper, the performance of the employed coding schemes over a binary-input output-symmetric channel is analyzed, based on the density evolution approach. The validity of the analytically obtained bit-error rates (BERs) over binary symmetric channels (BSCs) for each of the decoding iterations is verified by the system simulation. It is then shown that the application of these coding schemes in the optical BPPM-CDMA communication system, which can be modeled as a BSC, significantly improves the system performance. Particularly, for a certain BER (less than 10-7) and bandwidth, the coded systems not only permit a higher number (more than twice) of active users, compared with the uncoded systems, but also can operate at higher channel bit rate (up to four times) with more than 10% energy saving. Furthermore, by increasing the number of code dimensions, less power (less than 40%) is required to achieve the desired performance	binary symmetric channel;code;input/output;interference (communication);iteration;johnson–nyquist noise;modulation;optical fiber;profiling (computer programming);simulation;x.690	G.

They face a major drawback in turbulent atmospheres. So, we consider hybrid FSO/RF energy-aware WSN with reliable data communication using ECC (Error Control Coding) methods. LT codes are a class of rateless codes used for recovering data from the transmitted symbols, which are prone to erasure. They are normally applied for packet recovery in high packet loss scenarios. In this paper, we implement LT codes for Forward Error Correction (FEC). We consider BPSK subcarrier intensity modulated FSO communication where a method of discarding weak symbols received, is employed with an optimal erasure zone as a pre-processing stage in LT decoder. We determine the optimal symbol-erasure zone and also impose an upper bound on BPSK threshold. The performances of LT codes and BCH codes are analysed for FSO and RF channel under different atmospheric conditions and link ranges. We consider energy consumption per bit as a performance metric for comparison. The proposed method for LT codes was observed to be more energy-efficient than BCH code in highly turbulent atmospheric conditions.	bch code;error detection and correction;forward error correction;interference (communication);license-free software;luby transform code;modulation;network packet;performance;potential energy surface;preprocessor;profiling (computer programming);radio frequency;software deployment;subcarrier;turbulence	Anuj Nayak	2014	2014 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)	10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968562	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	44.24387144188161	66.4264456558236	90785

These systems are attractive, low complexity alternatives to the combination of interleaving and error-control coding for achieving time diversity in fading environments. To make the performance of these systems robust to channel estimation errors, we derive the linear equalizer at the receiver that maximizes the effective signal-to-noiseand-interference ratio (SNIR) subject to uncertainty in the channel measurements. We examine the bit-error rate performance and develop fixed and dynamic solutions to the associated problem of optimal power allocation between the data transmissions and channel measurements. The effectiveness of these algorithms is demonstrated through measurements obtained from an indoor wireless setting.	algorithm;bit error rate;channel state information;coefficient;equalization (communications);error detection and correction;forward error correction;interference (communication)	J.

First, we propose a maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver for STBC-OFDM systems based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By assuming that the fading processes remain constant over the duration of one STBC code word, and by exploiting the orthogonality property of the STBC as well as the OFDM modulation, we show that the EM-based receiver has a very low computational complexity, and that the initialization of the EM receiver is based on the linear minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) channel estimate for both the pilot and the data transmission. Since the actual fading processes may vary within one STBC code word, we also analyze the effect of a modelling mismatch on the receiver performance, and show both analytically and through simulations that the performance degradation due to such a mismatch is negligible for practical Doppler frequencies. We further propose a Turbo receiver based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP)-EM algorithm for STBC-OFDM systems with outer channel coding. Compared with the previous non-iterative receiver employing a decision-directed linear channel estimator, the iterative receivers proposed here significantly improve the receiver performance and can approach the ML performance in typical wireless channels with very fast fading, at a reasonable computational complexity well suited for real-time implementations.	code word;computational complexity theory;dispersive partial differential equation;elegant degradation;expectation–maximization algorithm;forward error correction;iteration;iterative method;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;modulation;multiplexing;real-time clock;simulation	Ben Lu;Xiaodong Wang;Ye Li	2001		10.1109/GLOCOM.2001.965170	expectation–maximization algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;channel state information;fading;statistics	Mobile	47.59599878617671	74.4345130269545	91033

The carrier-less nature of this nonconventional totally real transmission technique necessitates the construction of new suitable coding schemes. In fact, the last generation of complex-valued ST codes (namely, the perfect codes) cannot be associated with IR-UWB systems where the phase reconstitution at the receiver side is practically infeasible. On the other hand, while the perfect codes were considered mainly with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and hexagonal (HEX) constellations, IR-UWB systems are often associated with pulse-position modulation (PPM) and hybrid PPM-PAM (pulse-amplitude modulation) constellations. In this paper, instead of adopting the classical approach of constructing ST codes over infinite fields or for the perfect codes), we study the possibility of constructing modulation-specific codes that are exclusive to PPM and PPM-PAM. The proposed full-rate codes are totally real, information lossless, and have a uniform average energy per transmit antenna. They permit to achieve a full diversity order with any number of transmit antennas. In some situations, the proposed schemes have an optimal nonvanishing coding gain and satisfy all the construction constraints of the perfect codes in addition to the constraint of being totally real. Simulations performed over realistic indoor UWB channels showed that the proposed schemes outperform the best known codes constructed from cyclic division algebras.	code;coding gain;computer simulation;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hamming bound;lossless compression;modulation;ultra-wideband	Chadi Abou-Rjeily;Jean-Claude Belfiore	2007	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2007.899472	block code;turbo code;online codes;fountain code;telecommunications;computer science;ultra-wideband;linear code;expander code;luby transform code;mathematics;error floor	Theory	43.13284041762538	71.90339321627503	91207

In standard turbo codes, all bits are transmitted with equal energy. Extensive research efforts have been examining ways to enhance the performance of turbo codes for short frames. One way is to optimise the energy allocated to each bit stream to achieve the best performance possible. In this paper, a novel scheme to improve the bit error rate BER performance of turbo codes with short frame size is presented. Theoretically, a formula is derived to optimise the bit energy and experimentally, an adjustable parameter is employed so that the proposed scheme can be used over a wide range of SNR. A case study verifies the efficiency of the scheme. It shows that the improvements of BER for turbo codes with short frame size are significant.

Upper bounds are obtained for uniform parity-check ensembles, sparse parity-check ensembles, general parity-check ensembles (e.g., Gallager regular nonbinary low-density parity-check ensembles), and for any given linear code with known distance spectrum. The tightness of the upper bounds is confirmed both by the comparison with simple lower bounds and, for Gallager low-density parity-check ensembles, by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Exploiting the derived bounds, it is shown how already for short blocks and small q>2 sparse ensembles attain block error probabilities close to those of idealized maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, down to low error probabilities, whereas in the same regime binary codes show visible losses with respect to the Singleton bound. Thanks to the accurate performance estimates, the developed bounds can support the design of near-optimum erasure correcting codes with short and moderate lengths.	binary code;binary erasure channel;block code;channel capacity;decoding methods;linear code;mds matrix;monte carlo method;parity bit;simulation;singleton bound;sparse graph code;sparse matrix	Gianluigi Liva;Enrico Paolini;Marco Chiani	2013	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2013.032013.120504	block code;erasure code;list decoding;concatenated error correction code;binary code;turbo code;combinatorics;singleton bound;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;channel code;sequential decoding;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;bcjr algorithm;tornado code;linear code;hamming code;expander code;luby transform code;mathematics;forward error correction;raptor code;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;statistics;monte carlo method	Theory	40.00140651404696	61.4255644177825	91353

Basar et al. in [1] over a quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel. Based on the Verdu's theorem [2], the concept of the spatial constellation (SC) codewords and maximum likelihood (ML) decoder in [3], the upper bound is obtained by eliminating a number of redundant pairwise error probabilities (PEPs). Our approach leads to a new upper bound, which is tighter than the union bound. Consequently, it allows us to evaluate the bit-error performance of STBC-SM systems more exactly, particularly when the signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) is sufficiently high.	bit error rate;code word;modulation;noise power;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;tom	Van-Thien Luong;Minh-Tuan Le;Hong-Anh Mai;Xuan Nam Tran;Vu-Duc Ngo	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343366	telecommunications;probability of error;yttrium;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;fading;statistics;mimo;modulation	Embedded	42.098405649634095	71.84458363561183	91354

However, the phase conditions of only the central wavelength among the ones forming a pulse were analyzed. For a more specific consideration, we calculated the phase of each wavelength forming the decoded pulse. In this report, the measured and calculated reflecting properties were compared and the reliability of the method was confirmed. We calculated the phase conditions of the decoded pulses and clarified the phase characteristics with regard to the phase modulation and the interference between pulses overlapped during decoding. For the realization of an asynchronous access, the FBG phase en/decoders should be designed so that the spreading time is the inverse of 2×(transmission rate).	coherent	Renichi Moritomo;Tomoaki Nakamura;Yasuhiro Kotani;Saeko Oshiba	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e91-b.8.2509	telecommunications;computer science;fiber bragg grating	Vision	50.413930796017084	68.60602089957763	91466

Its efficient hardware architecture, with parallel pipeline, is presented in detail. Thanks to the stochastic approach, all arithmetic operations of the detector are implemented with simple logic structures. Several approaches which can potentially improve the detection performance are exploited. Simulation results have demonstrated that the stochastic BP detector can achieve similar detection performance compared with deterministic one for 32 × 32 MIMO system with 4-quadrature amplitude modulation (4-QAM). With the increase of antenna number, the detection performance improves at the linear expense of complexity and latency. Therefore, the proposed stochastic BP detector is suitable for large-scale MIMO system applications with good balance of detection performance and implementation complexity.	belief propagation;mimo;pulse-width modulation;simulation;software propagation	Junmei Yang;Chuan Zhang;Shugong Xu;Xiaohu You	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472939	real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science	Robotics	46.95463850436603	68.64661300953016	91840

A new method for identifying the automorphism groups of RS binary images is first developed. The new algorithm runs effectively, and can handle more RS codes and capture more automorphism groups than the existing ones. Utilizing the automorphism results, a new bit-level soft-decision decoding algorithm is subsequently developed for general (n,n-3,4) RS codes. Simulation on (31,28,4) RS codes demonstrates an impressive gain of more than 1 dB at the bit error rate of 10-5 over the existing algorithms.	algorithm;binary image;bit error rate;bit-level parallelism;decibel;folded reed–solomon code;graph automorphism;reed–solomon error correction;simulation;soft-decision decoder	Vo Tam Van;Seiichi Mita;Jing Li;Chau Yuen;Yong Liang Guan	2013	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2013.020513.130016	block code;list decoding;concatenated error correction code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;sequential decoding;bcjr algorithm;mathematics;berlekamp–welch algorithm;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;algebra	Vision	42.51262907698993	60.63082483573892	91970

Building on a parallel frequency-domain sampling structure for ADCs, this letter derives a new quantization bit allocation scheme that effectively removes strong NBI. Frequency bins hosting NBIs are allocated with no quantization bits. Optimal rules for symbol detection and quantization bit allocation are derived by jointly minimizing the mean square error of the decoding output.	ampersand;analog-to-digital converter;catastrophic interference;dynamic range;foremost;interference (communication);mean squared error;sampling (signal processing)	Feng Wang;Zhi Tian	2008	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2008.080272	telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;accuracy and precision;statistics	Metrics	49.818678419615075	71.9421042620593	91988

The design approach is applied to design 10-Gigabit Ethernet transceivers over copper cables. For a specified encoding speed, the proposed method requires substantially lower complexity in terms of area and storage. Furthermore, this method is generic and can be adapted easily for other LDPC codes. One major advantage of this design is that it does not require column swapping and it maintains compatibility with optimized LDPC decoders. For a 10-Gigabit Ethernet transceiver which is compliant with the IEEE 802.3 an standard, the proposed sequential (5-Parallel) hybrid architecture has the following implementation properties: critical path: (log2(324) + 1)Txor + Tand, number of XOR gates: 11 056, number of and gates: 1620, and ROM storage: 104 976 bits (which can be minimized to 52 488 bits using additional hardware). This method achieves comparable critical path, and requires 74% gate area, 10% ROM storage as compared with a similar 10-Gigabit sequential (5-parallel) LDPC encoder design using only the G matrix multiplication method. Additionally the proposed method accesses fewer bits per cycle than the G matrix method which reduces power consumption by about 82%.	application-specific integrated circuit;approximation algorithm;clock signal;complexity;critical path method;encoder;exclusive or;field-programmable gate array;gigabit;low-density parity-check code;matrix method;matrix multiplication;paging;parallel computing;programmable logic array;qr code;read-only memory;reed–solomon error correction;requirement;richardson number;richardson–lucy deconvolution;row (database);shift register;transceiver;triangular matrix	Aaron E.

Tarokh, Jafarkhani, and Calderbank extended the theory of classical orthogonal designs to the theory of generalized, real, or complex, linear processing orthogonal designs and then applied the theory of generalized orthogonal designs to construct space–time block codes (STBCs) with the maximum possible diversity order while having a simple decoding algorithm for any given number of transmit and receive antennas. It has been known that the STBCs constructed in this way can achieve the maximum possible rate of one forevery numberof transmit antennas using any arbitrary real constellation and for two transmit antennas using any arbitrary complexconstellation. Contrary to this, in this correspondence we prove that there doesnot exist rate-one STBC from generalized complex linear processing orthogonal designs formore than twotransmit antennas using any arbitrary complexconstellation.	algorithm;code;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method	Xue-Bin Liang;Xiang-Gen Xia	2003	IEEE Trans.

The objective function underlying the standard iterative decoding is a coarse approximation of the optimal Maximum Likelihood Decoding. This approximation is suitable when large block of data are processed but may be critical for short blocks. In this contribution, it is proved that refined approximations can be obtained by propagating extrinsics on groups of bits. The particular case of pairwise joint probability propagation is investigated. Its computational complexity is similar to standard iterative decoding.

In addition, often a cyclic prefix (CP) longer than the channel delay spread is assumed, and thus the impact of the possible inter-symbol interference (ISI) from adjacent OFDM symbols is not a consideration. This work provides a consolidated framework for study and analysis of OFDM systems with imperfections. The imperfections include time and frequency synchronization errors, and channel delay spread beyond the CP duration. Transmit as well as receive filtering operations are explicitly modeled, and different receiver detection criteria are considered. The use of an OFDM waveform for UWB applications is known to be a promising choice to simplify the receiver design and to maximize the bandwidth scalability, as well as the adaptation to various spectrum allocations. We present bit error rate (BER) sensitivity analysis to key system parameters for OFDM-based UWB applications. From these sensitivity analyses, we see graceful performance degradation with decreasing CP length and increasing residual frequency error. The performance degradation can be much more critical for timing synchronization errors.	bit error rate;elegant degradation;interference (communication);key;scalability;ultra-wideband;waveform;x.690	Juan I.

Unlike existing performance analysis tools for BI-ST systems, the new bound provides a general framework for analysing the performance of BI-ST systems employing finite interleaver sizes. The derivation is based on the uniform interleaving assumption of the coded sequence prior to transmission over multiple antennas. The new bound is a function of the distance spectrum of the code, the signal constellation used and the space–time (ST) mapping scheme. The bound is derived for a general BI-ST coded system and applied to two specific examples, namely, the BI space –time coded modulation and the BI space– time block codes. Results show that the analysis provides a close approximation to the BI-ST performance for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. The analysis can also accurately characterise the performance differences between different interleaver sizes, which is a breakthrough in the analysis of BI-ST coded systems.	approximation;bit error rate;code;forward error correction;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio	Salam A.

In this paper, we present three novel lattice reduction algorithms. First, using a unimodular transformation, a significant improvement on an existing Hermite-Korkine-Zolotareff-reduction algorithm is proposed. Then, we present two practical algorithms for constructing Minkowski-reduced bases. To assess the output quality, we compare the orthogonality defect of the reduced bases produced by LLL algorithm and our new algorithms, and find that in practice Minkowski-reduced basis vectors are the closest to being orthogonal. An error-rate analysis of suboptimal decoding algorithms aided by different reduction notions is also presented. To this aim, the proximity factor is employed as a measurement. We improve some existing results and derive upper bounds for the proximity factors of Minkowski-reduction-aided decoding (MRAD) to show that MRAD can achieve the same diversity order with infinite lattice decoding (ILD).	basis (linear algebra);detection theory;internet listing display;lattice reduction;lenstra–lenstra–lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm;mimo;numerical method;sensor;software bug;unimodular polynomial matrix	Wen Zhang;Sanzheng Qiao;Yimin Wei	2012	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2012.2210708	algorithm design;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;minkowski space;lattice reduction;theoretical computer science;lattice;mathematics;statistics;detection theory;mimo	Visualization	41.6630475119695	67.37127414389866	92887

At high implementational complexities, the best performance was typically provided by Alamouti's unity-rate G/sub 2/ code in both the 2-BPS and 3-BPS scenarios. However, if a low complexity implementation is sought, the 3-BPS 8PSK space-time trellis code outperforms the G/sub 2/ code. The G/sub 2/ space-time block code is also combined with symbol-by-symbol adaptive orthogonal frequency division multiplex (AOFDM) modems and turbo convolutional channel codecs for enhancing the system's performance. It was concluded that upon exploiting the diversity effect of the G/sub 2/ space-time block code, the channel-induced fading effects are mitigated, and therefore, the benefits of adaptive modulation erode. In other words, once the time- and frequency-domain fades of the wideband channel have been counteracted by the diversity-aided G/sub 2/ code, the benefits of adaptive modulation erode, and hence, it is sufficient to employ fixed-mode modems. Therefore, the low-complexity approach of mitigating the effects of fading can be viewed as employing a single-transmitter, single-receiver-based AOFDM modem. By contrast, it is sufficient to employ fixed-mode OFDM modems when the added complexity of a two-transmitter G/sub 2/ scheme is affordable.	adaptive filter;additive white gaussian noise;block code;codec;complexity;concatenation;convolutional code;decoding methods;dispersive partial differential equation;forward error correction;frequency divider;half rate;ibm basic programming support;maximum throughput scheduling;modem;modulation;multiplexing;newsml-g2;reed–solomon error correction;set-top box;simulation;subcarrier;transmitter;trellis quantization;turbo code;x.690	Tong-Hooi Liew;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2006	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2005.861174	block code;electronic engineering;real-time computing;space–time block code;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;statistics	HPC	44.07770184605637	73.59777059902716	93012

Our approach is motivated by the resemblance of the multichannel signal model resulting from oversampling (or use of multiple receive sensors) of the received OFDM signal to that in conventional single carrier system. The proposed algorithm distinguishes itself from many previously reported channel estimation methods by the elimination of the cyclic prefix, thereby leading to higher channel utilization. Comparison of the proposed method with other two reported subspace channel estimation methods is presented by computer simulations to support its effectiveness.	channel state information	Sumit Roy;Chengyang Li	2002	IEEE Trans.

Using fewer computations, the DPD achieves higher accuracy than that of the typical arctangent phase discriminator (APD). The improvement is up to several orders when the sampling frequency keeps increasing since the accuracy of APD is bounded mainly due to quantization loss. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach and the critical uniformity condition is verified.	analog-to-digital converter;auditory processing disorder;circuit complexity;computation;discriminator;sampling (signal processing);simulation	Chieh-Fu Chang;Ming-Seng Kao	2008	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2008.922517	constant fraction discriminator;global positioning system;quantization;telecommunications;computer science;noise;mathematics;accuracy and precision;sampling;statistics	Arch	52.345639727254245	69.49769814164608	93457

When PAPR of the signal is larger than the input-back off (IBO) of the high power amplifier (HPA), signal powers larger than the saturation threshold of the HPA cause the saturation events so that the error rate performance is degraded. To improve the error-rate performance degraded by the nonlinear distortion, not only the signal power above the saturation threshold but also the interval of the signals causing the saturation events at HPA should be reduced. In this paper, we propose the total exceeding power (TEP) as a new criterion for improving the error rate performance degraded by the nonlinear amplifier for multicarrier transmission.	amplifier;elegant degradation	Osamu Takyu;Tomoaki Ohtsuki;Masao Nakagawa	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e88-b.7.3057	nonlinear distortion;error detection and correction;degradation;telecommunications;word error rate;computer science;electrical engineering;amplifier;saturation;data transmission	Mobile	48.910306897852536	71.46773216620848	93543

They have recently been adopted by several data communication standards such as DVB-S2 and WiMax. LDPCs are represented by bipartite graphs, also called Tanner graphs, and their decoding demands very intensive computation. For that reason, VLSI dedicated architectures have been investigated and developed over the last few years. This paper proposes a new approach for LDPC decoding on graphics processing units (GPUs). Efficient data structures and an new algorithm are proposed to represent the Tanner graph and to perform LDPC decoding according to the stream-based computing model. GPUs were programmed to efficiently implement the proposed algorithms by applying data-parallel intensive computing. Experimental results show that GPUs perform LDPC decoding nearly three orders of magnitude faster than modern CPUs. Moreover, they lead to the conclusion that GPUs with their tremendous processing power can be considered as a consistent alternative to state-of-the-art hardware LDPC decoders.	algorithm;central processing unit;computation;computer graphics;dvb-s2;data structure;digital video broadcasting;error detection and correction;graphics processing unit;low-density parity-check code;tanner graph;very-large-scale integration	Gabriel Falcão Paiva Fernandes;Leonel Sousa;Vítor Manuel Mendes da Silva	2008		10.1145/1345206.1345221	parallel processing;computer architecture;parallel computing;low-density parity-check code;data structure;computer science;theoretical computer science;error floor	HPC	44.71691361820106	63.016038731726795	94103

Thereby, methods based on lattice basis reducti on are of special interest, as they achieve the optimum diversi ty order. In this paper, a tutorial overview on LRA equalization optimized according to the MMSE criterion is given. It is proven that applying the zero-forcing BLAST algorithm to a suitably augmented channel matrix—the inverse of the square root of t he correlation matrix of the data symbols times the noise variance forms its lower part—results in the optimum solution. This fact is already widely used but lacks a formal proof. It turns out that it is more important to take the correlations of the data correctly into account than what type of lattice reduction actually isused. I. I NTRODUCTION The joint reception of signals transmitted in parallel—eit h r considering multi-antenna systems or multi-user scenario s— will become even more important over the next years. When designing transmission systems for such multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) channels, the interference amoung the individual signals has to be dealt with by means of equalization. During the last decade, numerous techniques known from intersymbol-interference channels—e.g., linear equaliz ation, decision-feedback equalization (DFE, also known as s uccessive interference c ancellation (SIC) and also used in the Bell Laboratories s pace-t ime (BLAST) approach), maximumlikelihood detection, cf. [3, Table E.1]—have been transfe rred to the MIMO setting. However, novel approaches based on lattice basis reduction, e.g., [21], [17], are of special in terest. Using theselattice-reduction-aided (LRA) techniques, lowcomplexity equalization achieving the optimum diversity b ehavior [15] is enabled. In this paper, a tutorial overview on LRA equalization optimized according to theminimum mean-squared error (MMSE) criterion is given. It is shown that it is more important to take the inherently introduced correlations of the data symbols correctly into account, than which lattice reducti on approach actually is used. The main result of the paper is to establish a connection of the V-BLAST algorithm to the successive MMSE estimation of correlated data starting from basic principles. It is proven that applying (zero-for cing) BLAST to a suitably augmented channel matrix—having the inverse of the square root of the correlation matrix of the da ta symbols times the noise variance as its lower part—indeed results in the optimum solution. To the best knowledge of the R. Fischer is with Lehrstuhl für Informationsübertragun , Friedrich– Alexander–Universität Erlangen–Nürnberg, Cauerstras e 7/LIT, 91058 Erlangen, Germany, Email: fischer@LNT.de authors, a formal proof for this fact yet has not being presen ted in literature. However, it has been used widely without taki ng care of its validity. The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II the channel model is introduced and conventional equalization techniq ues are briefly reviewed. Lattice-reduction-aided equalizati on s addressed in Sec. III and its MMSE DFE version is analyzed in detail in Sec. IV. Concluding remarks follow in Sec. V and in the Appendix fundamentals on estimation are compiled. II. CHANNEL MODEL AND EQUALIZATION We consider uncoded multiple-antenna transmission over fla tfading channels where joint equalization at the receiver si de is possible. The input/output relation is given by the usual equation1 y = Ha+ n . (1) This model has either to be understood in complex base-band notation or as its real-valued model with doubled dimension ality [9]. As all subsequent discussions can either be appli ed to the complex or the real model, we do not distinguish both approaches in the sequel. In each case, the channel matrix is expected to be of dimension NR × NT. The differences between both views are discussed if required. For successiv e schemes, due to the larger degree of freedom, usually the rea lvalued model has some advantages [4]. Each component aμ of a is independently drawn from a zero-mean one-dimensional M -ary ASK constellationA = {±1/2,±3/2, . . . ,±(M − 1)/2} or an M-ary QAM constellation, with anM -ary ASK per quadrature component. The correlation matrix of the data vector hence reads Φaa def = E{aaH} = σ aI, with varianceσ a def = E{|aμ|}. The noise is assumed to be spatially white with variance σ n per component, i.e., Φnn def = E{nnH} = σ nI. A. Linear Equalization The interference between the parallel data streams can be eliminated by means of equalization, i.e., via r = HRy a decision vector is generated. Having r, individual threshold decision can be performed.

In this paper, we show that PIC and PIC-SIC decoders are capable of achieving the full cooperative diversity available in wireless relay networks. We give sufficient conditions for a Distributed Space-Time Block Code (DSTBC) to achieve full diversity with PIC and PIC-SIC decoders and construct a new class of DSTBCs with low complexity full-diversity PIC-SIC decoding. We also show that almost all known full-diversity PIC/PIC-SIC decodable codes constructed for point-to-point MIMO channels can be used as full-diversity PIC/PIC-SIC decodable DSTBCs in relay networks. The proposed DSTBCs with low complexity, full-diversity PIC/PIC-SIC decoding achieve higher rates (in complex symbols per channel use) than the multigroup ML decodable DSTBCs available in the literature. Simulation results show that the proposed codes have better bit error rate performance than the best known low complexity, full-diversity DSTBCs.	interference (communication)	Natarajan Lakshmi Prasad;B.

In our previous work, we proposed an Early Stopping (ES) strategy for a turbo HARQ scheme, which results in beneficial complexity reduction while maintaining a high throughput. However, this scheme was designed to strike a compromise across the full range of channel conditions. As a further advance, in this paper, we propose a new Deferred Iterations (DI) strategy, which is specifically designed to take into account the prevalent channel conditions, as characterized by the Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart tunnel opening. More specifically, the DI strategy delays the commencement of the turbo-decoding until an open EXIT chart tunnel appears. Our simulation results demonstrate that the complexity of the proposed DI-aided turbo HARQ schemes is reduced by up to 50%, which is achieved without compromising the packet loss ratio (PLR) or throughput.	carpal tunnel syndrome;compaq lte;deferred shading;exit chart;early stopping;elegant degradation;hybrid automatic repeat request;iteration;lookup table;network packet;public lending right;reduction (complexity);relay;simulation;throughput;turbo code	Hong Chen;Robert G.

From a semi-tutorial perspective, a number of previous results are rederived and new insights are gained within a unified framework. A probabilistic derivation of the well-known Viterbi algorithm, forward-backward, and sum-product algorithms, shows that a basic metric emerges naturally under very general causality and finite-memory conditions. This result implies that detection solutions based on one algorithm can be systematically extended to other algorithms. For stochastic channels described by a suitable parametric model, a conditional Markov property is shown to imply this finite-memory condition. This conditional Markov property, although seldom met exactly in practice, is shown to represent a reasonable and useful approximation in all considered cases. We consider, as examples, linear predictive and noncoherent detection schemes. While good performance for increasing complexity can often be achieved with a finite-memory detection strategy, key issues in the design of detection algorithms are the computational efficiency and the performance for limited complexity.	approximation;causality;computation;linear predictive coding;markov chain;markov property;parametric model;semiconductor industry;unified framework;viterbi algorithm;whole earth 'lectronic link	Gianluigi Ferrari;Giulio Colavolpe;Riccardo Raheli	2005	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2005.853812	parametric model;index term;channel code;markov property;viterbi algorithm;graph theory;theoretical computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;markov process;statistics	ML	46.46849065704597	71.28884645415353	95691
433790304a1c2523c3b9b184a2713e727d0e034c	improving map arithmetic decoding of h.264 intra modes using residual redundancy		This paper presents an improved MAP decoder to be used for joint source-channel arithmetic decoding for H.264 symbols. The proposed decoder uses not only the intentional redundancy inserted via a forbidden symbol but also exploits residual redundancy by a syntax checker. A breadth-first suboptimal sequential MAP decoder is employed. The decoder eliminates paths in the decoding tree that result in invalid syntax or that decode a forbidden symbol. In contrast to previous methods, this is done as each channel bit is decoded. Simulations using intra prediction modes show improvements in error rates, for example, syntax element error rate reduction by an order of magnitude for channel SNR of 7.33dB. The cost of this improvement is more computational complexity spent on the syntax checking. © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Feedback MMSE power control is defined as a power-control function, with feedback MMSE predictions of the current channel fading gains as input that minimizes the system-error probability. The use of feedback requires causality, and an MMSE predictor has to be employed for the purpose of power control. Previously, in the literature, the predictor was used also in detection. The pilot-symbol system with MMSE power control is shown to achieve a clear performance improvement by employing a smoother, instead of the predictor, in detection. Furthermore, the performance loss caused by a feedback delay of 10%-20% from the channel coherence time appeared to be minor with reasonable bit-error rate levels. Finally, additional performance improvement using low-order diversity was shown to be considerable.	bit error rate;causality;feedback;kerrison predictor;modulation;rayleigh fading;x.690	Ilkka Saarinen;Aarne Mämmelä	2004	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836588	minimum mean square error;electronic engineering;bit error rate;telecommunications;power control;computer science;engineering;probability of error;rayleigh fading;control theory;feedback;mathematics;mean squared error;fading;statistics	Mobile	43.868456140891496	74.41638242392905	96083

A further main subject of the thesis is to develop an appropriate method for an evaluation of different coding techniques which are used to ensure a reliable data transfer. The development of this evaluation scheme is based on an appropriate channel model describing the unpredictable disturbances. #R##N##R##N#In this thesis, the unpredictable disturbances which occur during the transmission of digital data are interpreted as a sequence of bit errors and are represented by a binary stochastic error process. To model the error process we use a Markovian background process with a finite state space and a transition matrix Q. By means of this approach we are able to model digital transmission channels with memory. Since within this approach the advantages of already known channel models are combined and their disadvantages are widely extenuated this basic approach provides some explicit advantages. To ensure a reliable transmission of information different coding techniques are used which follow different mathematical approaches and are characterized by their different algebraic properties. On the one hand there exist so-called """"random error-correcting codes (REC)"""" which are more suited to correct randomly distributed transmission errors. On the other one there are so-called """"burst error-correcting codes (BEC)"""" which are able to correct so-called burst errors, i.e. errors which are correlated. In this connection, the error-correcting capabilities of different codes depend on their different algebraic properties. Thus, a further objective of this thesis is to develop an appropriate method to compare and evaluate the efficiency of REC versus BEC. In general, as an appropriate measure for the success of an error-correcting code the residual error rate is being used. Based on the channel model proposed in the first part of the thesis we develop recursive equations to calculate the residual error rates of codes. In this context, we differentiate between REC and BEC; i.e. we consider the advantages of different mathematical approaches of different error-correcting codes in this evaluation of their performance. One important result is that the use of BEC should be preferred if the memory of the considered transmission channel is sufficiently strong. Another result is that by means of these recursive equations an optimal and adequate error-correcting code can be chosen a priori depending on the error statistics of the considered transmission channel."""	gesellschaft für informatik	Claudia Osmann	1999			telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;algorithm	Theory	40.35170753350818	65.04427681709758	96158

A bursterror-correcting convolutional code, which combines encoding and interleaving via a sparse encoder and a convolutional interleaver, is selected as the channel code. A previously-proposed parallel-trellis framework is adopted for implementing the maximum a posteriori (MAP) equalizer and decoder in the turbo equalizer. Such a system exhibits a similar level of performance to a conventional system using a random-error-correcting convolutional code together with a row/column (R/C) or random block interleaver. Yet, the proposed system has the advantages of low latency and low memory requirements when compared to those conventional systems. This is due to (i) the elimination of the block-type interleavers and deinterleavers and (ii) the parallelism achieved in the turbo equalizer. One disadvantage of the proposed system is a decrease in throughput, as more tail symbols are required for proper termination of all sub-trellises in the decoder. Extension of the proposed system to turbo codes is considered. Also, the effect of prefiltering on a nonminimum-phase, high definition television (HDTV) channel is examined. Results indicate that using the feedforward filter (FFF) of a nonuniformly-spaced decision feedback equalizer (NUDFE) performs almost as good as using one with a large number of uniformly-spaced taps. However, far fewer computations are needed to find the optimum tap values of the sparse prefilter.	coding theory;computation;encoder;equalization (communications);error detection and correction;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;forward error correction;fused filament fabrication;minimum phase;multipath propagation;parallel computing;quantum convolutional code;requirement;sparse matrix;throughput;trellis quantization;turbo code;turbo equalizer	Frederick K.

In this letter, we propose a variable-node-based dynamic scheduling decoding algorithm. For the proposed algorithm, the reliability of variable nodes is evaluated based on the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) values and the parity-check equations; then, a more accurate dynamic selection strategy is presented. Simultaneously, the oscillating variable nodes are processed so that the influence of the spread of error messages caused by oscillation are suppressed. In addition, the proposed algorithm updates the same number of messages in one iteration as the original BP decoding algorithm does, which is different from some other dynamic decoding algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms.	algorithm;belief propagation;decoding methods;error message;iteration;low-density parity-check code;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;parity bit;scheduling (computing);simulation;software propagation	Xingcheng Liu;Yuanbin Zhang;Ru Cui	2015	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2385096	list decoding;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;bit error rate;dynamic priority scheduling;sequential decoding;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;berlekamp–welch algorithm;oscillation;statistics	HPC	43.36208798180016	64.22562660092954	96647

This method is based on sending a fraction of the information bits along with a fraction of parity bits generated by the LDPC code. First, we study the problem of DSC of two correlated sources at the symmetric rate. We propose to use nonuniform LDPC codes for this application. Then, we generalize our approach to any arbitrary rate. The detailed construction of this scheme is investigated. We illustrate that the design procedure for the LDPC code simplifies to the design of rate-adaptive LDPC codes that need unequal error protection. It is shown that the performance of DSC at any arbitrary rate is almost the same as that of asymmetric rates. Because of the proposed decoding algorithm, each of the sources is decoded independently (only part of the information bits are being exchanged between the decoders). Therefore, this approach does not suffer from the problems of heavy damage or propagation of errors. This method can be easily applied to joint source-channel coding.	algorithm;channel capacity;data compression;distributed source coding;forward error correction;low-density parity-check code;parity bit;propagation of uncertainty;qr code;simulation;slepian–wolf coding;software propagation	Mina Sartipi;Faramarz Fekri	2005	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2005	10.1109/WCNC.2005.1424816	distributed source coding;low-density parity-check code;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;forward error correction;statistics	Mobile	39.89159549567075	63.81411054160042	96999

Therefore low OWs are desirable, but, if the OW is too low, then an inevitable performance degradation will be introduced. For that reason it is desirable to determine the minimum OW that does not impose a significant performance degradation. Previous efforts have advocated different OWs based on results obtained using time-consuming bit-error ratio (BER) simulations. However, these BER simulations are extremely time consuming, owing to the requirement of considering a range of channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Therefore, in this paper, we propose the employment of extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts to overcome this drawback. Furthermore, EXIT-chart analysis has the additional benefit of offering insights into the specific causes of the performance degradations encountered. Finally, a FP scheme having an overall OW of 6 bits is proposed for the implementation of the min-sum algorithm (MSA).	algorithm;bit error rate;computation;computational complexity theory;exit chart;elegant degradation;fixed point (mathematics);low-density parity-check code;maxima and minima;operand;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;x.690	Xin Zuo;Robert G.

The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for target localization accuracy is developed for both coherent and noncoherent processing. Coherent processing requires a common phase reference for all transmit and receive sensors. The CRLB is shown to be inversely proportional to the signal effective bandwidth in the noncoherent case, but is approximately inversely proportional to the carrier frequency in the coherent case. We further prove that optimization over the sensors' positions lowers the CRLB by a factor equal to the product of the number of transmitting and receiving sensors. The best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) is derived for the MIMO target localization problem. The BLUE's utility is in providing a closed-form localization estimate that facilitates the analysis of the relations between sensors locations, target location, and localization accuracy. Geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) contours are used to map the relative performance accuracy for a given layout of radars over a given geographic area.	autocorrelation;broadcast delay;carrier frequency;coherence (physics);coherent;dilution of precision (computer graphics);dilution of precision (navigation);flow-following, finite-volume icosahedral model;gaussian process;linear algebra;mimo;mathematical optimization;microsoft windows 98;portable document format;radar;sensor;stemming;stochastic process;the matrix;transmitter;windows 95	Hana Godrich;Alexander M.

At the receiver end, each description can be reproduced with acceptable side distortion; reconstructed signals with lower central distortion can be accomplished by exploiting more descriptions. In order to apply the classical MDC over error-prone channels, we propose error-resilient multiple description coding (ERMDC) to utilize the inherent dependency and redundancy between descriptions to combat bit errors. In this paper, we develop a pair of the ERMDC encoder and central decoder based on the multiple description scalar quantizer (MDSQ). After deriving optimal and suboptimal ERMDC decoders, a novel index assignment algorithm is provided for the ERMDC encoder to improve the error detection capability of the ERMDC decoders. Analytical and experimental results show that the ERMDC outperforms the conventional MDSQ encoder-decoder pair, and achieves lower reconstruction distortions than the side distortion within a large range of bit error rates (BERs).	algorithm;bit error rate;cognitive dimensions of notations;distortion;encoder;error detection and correction;multiple description coding;quantization (signal processing)	Rui Ma;Fabrice Labeau	2008	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2008.925900	error detection and correction;speech recognition;bit error rate;computer science;theoretical computer science;multiple description coding;signal processing;mathematics;statistics	Vision	41.60715007554462	65.04043517244382	97534

In the past, various structures of single code rate LDPC decoders have been implemented for different applications. However, in order to cover a wide range of service requirements and diverse interference conditions in wireless applications, LDPC decoders that can operate in both high and low code rates are desired. In this paper, a new multi-rate LDPC decoder architecture is presented and implemented in a Xilinx FPGA device. Through selection pins, three operating modes with the irregular 1/2 rate, regular 5/8 rate and regular 7/8 rate are supported. The measurement results show LDPC decoder can achieve BER below 10-5 at SNR of 1.4dB in the most critical case with the irregular 1/2 mode.	field-programmable gate array;low-density parity-check code	Lei Yang;Manyuan Shen;Hui Liu;C.-J.

When it is combined with trellis-coded continuous phase modulation (TCCPM) with convolutional codes over rings, a powerful joint source and channel coding (JSCC) scheme can be formed. We investigate the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and the Rayleigh fading channel. Optimal soft decoding for the proposed JSCC scheme is studied. The soft decoder is based on the a posteriori probability (APP) algorithm for TCCPM with ring convolutional codes. It is shown that these systems with soft decoding outperform the same systems with hard decoding especially when the systems operate at low to medium signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is demonstrated that the new trellis quantisation schemes based on ring convolutional codes is superior to conventional trellis-coded quantisation (TCQ) of the same complexity. The novelty of this work is in the development of a trellis-based quantisation method using ring convolutional codes and the use of a soft decoder and the APP algorithm for the combined systems.

Due to timing errors in circuits, there may be missed messages in intra-chip communications, equivalent to transiently missing connections. In this paper, we investigate the performance of message-passing LDPC decoders in the presence of missing connections. We prove concentration and convergence theorems that validate the use of density evolution performance analysis. Arbitrarily small error probability is not possible with missing connections, but we find suitably defined decoding thresholds for communication systems with binary erasure channels under peeling decoding, as well as binary symmetric channels under Gallager A and B decoding. We see that decoding is robust to missing wires, as decoding thresholds degrade smoothly. Moreover, there is a stochastic facilitation effect in Gallager B decoders with missing connections. We also conduct finite-length simulations, compare the decoding sensitivity to channel noise and to missing wiring, and perform preliminary error-tolerant manufacturing yield analysis.	algorithm;binary decoder;binary erasure channel;channel noise level;decoding methods;encoder;error-tolerant design;information processing;low-density parity-check code;mathematical optimization;message passing;noise (electronics);program optimization;robustness (computer science);simulation;smoothing;wiring	Linjia Chang;Avhishek Chatterjee;Lav R.

With respect to sum-rate capacity, numerical simulations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the zero-forcing beam-forming (ZFBF) and linear orthogonal beam-forming (OLBF).	mimo	Huan Sun;Xiaohu You	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e91-b.4.1223	computer simulation;zero forcing equalizer;simulation;orthogonal matrix;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;zero-forcing precoding;coding;beamforming;signal-to-noise ratio;scheduling;precoding	Mobile	48.41213208805817	72.41074756631107	97836

In an extended V-BLAST, those capacities are approached with single-dimensional coding and rate adaptation. However, such results require infinite precision for rate and power settings and perfect channel estimation. These assumptions are not practical due to a limited data rate of the feedback channel and a rapidly changing nature of a wireless channel. An algorithm for discretizing the rates and power control levels is proposed. We show that the loss in spectral efficiency due to rate and power control discretization is about 1-2 dB compared to that of an eigenmode transmission. We also consider the effects of imperfect channel estimation. We show that the performance loss is minimal when the channel estimation error is less than 2-3%.	blast;cs-blast;channel state information	Seong Taek Chung;Arak Sutivong	2002		10.1109/WCNC.2002.993350	telecommunications;power control;computer science;control theory;estimation theory;channel capacity;statistics;spectral efficiency	Vision	40.07967653156625	73.65287530694829	98016

The approach is a crystallization of the work of Hottinen which applies to space-time codes that are assisted by quasi-orthogonality. It is independent of implementation and is more general in that it can be applied to space-time codes such as the Golden Code and perfect space-time block codes, that are not assisted by quasi-orthogonality, to derive fast decoders with essentially maximum likelihood (ML) performance. The conditions under which conditional optimization leads to reduced complexity ML decoding are captured in terms of the induced channel at the receiver. These conditions are then translated back to the transmission domain leading to codes that are constructed by multiplexing orthogonal designs. The methods are applied to several block space-time codes obtained by multiplexing Alamouti blocks where it leads to ML decoding with complexity O(N 2) where N is the size of the underlying QAM signal constellation. A new code is presented that tests commonly accepted design principles and for which decoding by conditional optimization is both fast and ML. The two design principles for perfect space-time codes are nonvanishing determinant of pairwise differences and cubic shaping, and it is cubic shaping that restricts the possible multiplexing structures. The new code shows that it is possible to give up on cubic shaping without compromising code performance or decoding complexity.	code;cubic function;decoding methods;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;noise shaping;program optimization	S.

It is assumed that the legacy transmitter generates a cyclostationary signal, and that the legacy receiver is equipped with a linear filter followed by a uniform sampler. Under a zero-interference constraint at the legacy receiver, the meansquared error at the overlay receiver is minimized to find the optimal overlay system that employs linear modulation and demodulation. For the trade-off between performance and rate of the overlay system, the problem is formulated to allow a transmission rate that is a fraction of the fundamental cycle frequency of the legacy signal. The notion of a virtual legacy receiver is devised to incorporate cases with non-identical frequency bands for the transmission and reception of the overlay signal. Using the vectorized Fourier transform technique, the problem is reformulated, the solution is derived, and a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the optimal solution is found, all in the frequency domain. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the spectral efficiency by effectively exploiting the cyclostationarity of the legacy signal.	cyclostationary process;frequency band;interference (communication);legacy system;modulation;numerical method;sampling (signal processing);spanning tree;spectral efficiency;transmitter	Yeo Hun Yun;Joon Ho Cho	2010	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2010.05.090001	computer simulation;fourier transform;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;signal processing;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	52.639059432572196	72.66420255350153	98295

In this scheme, called Matrix Coded Modulation (MCM), a joint channel error-correcting code and space-time code is considered. Coherent systems are those for which Channel State Information (CSI) is available at the transmitters and/or at the receivers, and their performance strongly depend on the channel estimation. Generally, this CSI estimation requires the insertion of pilot-symbols in the transmitted frame which implies a spectral efficiency loss of the global system. The existing non-coherent MIMO systems like Differential Space Time Modulation (DSTM) suffer not only from the degradation of performance compared to coherent systems, but also from many constraints on the channel and the use of memory at reception. In the proposed MCM scheme, decoding can be achieved with or without CSI at the receiving antennas. Moreover, a low-complexity decoding algorithm is described and compared to the existing differential schemes.	algorithm;channel state information;coherent;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;convolutional code;elegant degradation;error detection and correction;forward error correction;hamming distance;mimo;modulation;multi-chip module;polynomial;spectral efficiency;transmitter;turbo code	Ali El Arab;Jean-Claude Carlach;Maryline Hélard	2011	2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089714	electronic engineering;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Arch	43.507701523488485	72.11986362272931	98301

Since the inherent properties and signal processing of the conventional communication channels are different from those of the fiber-optic channels, new code sequences must be constructed for fiber-optic applications. In unslotted systems, the exact solution is very difficult to obtain. Therefore, two approximation methods are presented to analyze the performance of such systems.

The VSF, maximising the mutual information exchanged between component decoders in a turbo decoder, is adaptively varied with a priori information of each component decoder. For a large size of interleaver, it is shown that the proposed algorithm improves the bit error rate performance and speed of decoding convergence of the conventional EMLMAP algorithm. The improved speed of the decoding convergence reduces the average number of iterations and results in low-power implementations of a turbo decoder.	bit error rate;forward error correction;genetic algorithm;image scaling;iteration;low-power broadcasting;mutual information;turbo code	J.

The main disadvantage of this scheme is its low average power efficiency which is an analogous problem to the high peak to mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) of multicarrier signals. In this paper, we consider the achievable average power reduction of MSM signals by using optimized reserved carriers and coding methods. Based on Nehari’s result we present a lower bound for the maximum average power of the signal after adding the reserved carriers. It is shown that the mean value of the average required power behaves very close to √ 2n log log n for a BPSK constellation where n is the number of subcarriers. We then consider finding the optimum values for the carriers and the effect of having finite bandwidth for reserved carriers. In the next section, mainly based on recent coding results for the PMEPR of multicarrier signals, we show the existence of very high rate codes with average power of O( √ n log n) for large values of n, and furthermore the existence of codes with non-vanishing to zero rate and average power of O( √ n) asymptotically.	code;markov switching multifractal;modulation;nehari manifold;optical wireless;performance per watt;subcarrier;time complexity	Masoud Sharif;Babak Hassibi	2003		10.1109/ICC.2003.1204608	electrical efficiency;telecommunications;computer science;intensity modulation;phase-shift keying;control theory;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;encoding;optical modulation amplitude;optical communication	Theory	39.565235251563436	71.1069094997839	98565

By defining necessary linguistic terms of the power commands and corresponding fuzzy inference rules, an Embedded Fuzzy Unit (EFU) is constructed. The role of our EFU is to produce appropriate digital power commands instead of the one-bit discrete commands directly obtained from the base station. Simulations show that the EFU-based mobile station can generate considerably smoother received power at the base station. The transient overshoot and steady channel tracking error are small. Moreover, our method has the advantage of simplicity in both structure and algorithm, and is thus easy for hardware implementation.		Xiao Zhi Gao;Seppo J.

A high-speed entropy coding system nsing these two techniques is considered for digital high definition television (HDTV) applications. Traditionally, VLC decoding is implemented through a tree-searching algorithm as the input bits are received serially. For HDTV applications, it is very difficult to implement a real-time VLC decoder of this kind due to the very high data rate required. In this paper, we introduce a parallel structured VLC decoder which decodes each codeword in one clock cycle regardless of its length. The required clock rate of the decoder is thus lower and parallel processing architectnres become easy to adopt in the entropy coding system. The parallel entropy coder and decoder will be implemented in two experimental prototype chips which are designed to encode and decode more than 52 million samples/s. Some related system issues, such as the synchronization of variable-length codewords and error concealment, are also discussed in this paper.	clock rate;clock signal;code word;data compression;data rate units;encode;entropy encoding;error concealment;parallel computing;programmable logic array;programmer;prototype;rlc circuit;real-time clock;run-length encoding;search algorithm;vlc media player;variable-length code	Shawmin Lei;Ming-Ting Sun	1991	IEEE Trans.

The downlink performance is significantly improved with FDE; however, the uplink performance is limited by the multi-access interference (MAI). To remove the MAI while gaining the frequency diversity effect through the use of FDE, frequency-domain block spread CDMA can be used. The performance can be further improved by the use of multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) antenna technique. Recently, particular attention has been paid to MIMO space division multiplexing (SDM) to significantly increase the throughput without expanding the signal bandwidth. In this paper, we present a comprehensive performance comparison of MCand DS-CDMA using FDE.	adaptive equalizer;adobe framemaker;bandwidth (signal processing);input/output;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);mimo;multiplexing;network packet;telecommunications link;throughput	Fumiyuki Adachi;Akinori Nakajima;Kazuaki Takeda;Long Liu;Hiromichi Tomeba;Tatsunori Yui;Kaoru Fukuda	2008	European Transactions on Telecommunications	10.1002/ett.1305	electronic engineering;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	49.00885124082695	71.99080654645746	99392

The fundamental principles of the error event simulation method in conjunction with importance sampling are reviewed. The importance sampling background for coded communications systems is discussed in the context of block codes, because it is easier to present the fundamentals of importance sampling without the additional complexities of Viterbi decoding. The details of the error event simulation method for Viterbi decoders and numerical examples that demonstrate this method are presented. These numerical examples involve both hard and soft decision decoding for the ideal additive Gaussian noise channel. The technique is shown to provide markedly improved efficiency. >	importance sampling;sampling (signal processing);simulation;viterbi decoder	John S. Sadowsky	1990	IEEE Trans.

Duncan's theorem (1970) on the relation between mutual information and the mean-square error of the optimum causal estimator of a random signal in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), the maximum achievable information transfer over the AWGN channel is derived with the random telegraph wave input. The information transfer is bounded and symptotically determined for the Wiener phase-modulated process input at large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Both results are compared to the information transfer for the capacity-achieving Gauss-Markov input process. For both the Wiener phase-modulated and the Gauss-Markov processes the information transfer increases asymptotically as the square root of SNR, but for the random telegraph wave it increases only as its logarithm. >	additive white gaussian noise	Israel Bar-David;Shlomo Shamai	1988	IEEE Trans.

In the DVC architecture based on a feedback channel, the high decoding complexity is mainly due to the request-decode operation with repetitively fixed step size (induced by Slepian-Wolf decoding). In this paper, a parallel message-passing decoding algorithm for low density parity check (LDPC) syndrome is applied through Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) based on General-Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU). Furthermore, we propose an approach to reduce the number of requests dubbed as Ladder Request Step Size (LRSS) which leads to more speedup gain. Experimental results show that, through our work, significant speedup in decoding time is achieved with negligible loss in rate-distortion (RD) performance.	algorithm;cuda;data compression;distortion;distributed source coding;general-purpose computing on graphics processing units;general-purpose markup language;graphics processing unit;iteration;lz77 and lz78;low-density parity-check code;message passing;parallel computing;parity bit;programming paradigm;ruby document format;signal processing;speedup	Yu-Shan Pai;Han-Ping Cheng;Yun-Chung Shen;Ja-Ling Wu	2010		10.1145/1873951.1874189	list decoding;parallel computing;message passing;real-time computing;low-density parity-check code;computer science;theoretical computer science	HPC	45.80642310978469	61.64376571287098	99784

The equalization algorithm exploits the property of matrix  LDLH  factorization to avoid direct or recursive computation of matrix inversion, thereby reducing the computational complexity. This algorithm also allows us to exploit the band approximation of the frequency-domain channel matrix to further reduce the complexity with minor performance degradation. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that the proposed algorithms reduce the computational complexity of the MMSE-SIC scheme while preserving a good performance.	equalization (communications);simplified instructional computer	Shaoping Chen;Yang Yang	2010	IEEE Trans.

A tight bound on the asymptotic error probability is derived to determine the optimal rotation matrix for SSD design and to identify the key parameters that influence the system performance. It is shown that, for small modulation constellation, a cascaded Rayleigh fading causes a much more severe performance degradation than a conventional Rayleigh fading. However, BICM-ID employing SSD with a sufficiently large constellation can close the performance gap between the conventional and cascaded Rayleigh fading channels, and their performance can closely approach that over an AWGN channel. Illustrative simulation results for various scenarios are in a good agreement with analytical derivations.	additive white gaussian noise;caller id;elegant degradation;iteration;modulation;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation;solid-state drive	Nghi H.

Minimum distance arguments are used to identify a region for which no other code is as efficient as repetition codes, whatever the rate, at least when bounded decoding is considered. However, in order to obtain a reasonable and sufficiently low BER, repetition codes are not very efficient. We present a coding scheme concatenating a repetition code with another one, and design rules in order to select these codes for a given watermarking application are developed. The repetition code lowers the huge channel BER, as no other code can do this part of the job. Then, the second more powerful code working at a lower BER achieves a larger BER reduction. In this paper, this role is devoted to BCH codes, as members of a classical family. Thanks to their moderate decoding complexity, they turn out to be an interesting cost versus performance trade-off, while more efficient coding schemes based on soft decoding are far more complex. However, we also provide an idea of the solutions to consider for watermarking applications with fewer complexity limitations, for which more powerful decoding techniques can be implemented. r 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.	bch code;concatenation;error detection and correction;forward error correction;repetition code;watermark (data file);x.690	Claude Desset;Benoit M.

As an example, for the recently proposed LDPC code from the upcoming IEEE 802.3ca standard for passive optical networks (PONs), an optimized mapping of the bit channels originating from bit-metric decoding to the protograph variable nodes gains 0.4 dB and 0.3 dB at a biterror rate of 10 for shaped and uniform signaling, respectively. Furthermore, the clipping value for a quantized sum-product LDPC decoder is optimized via discretized density evolution.	discretization;low-density parity-check code;modulation;passive optical network;quantization (signal processing)	Fabian Steiner;Gerhard Kramer	2018	CoRR		ieee 802;mathematical optimization;low-density parity-check code;mathematics;decoding methods;modulation;clipping (audio);discretization;electronic engineering;passive optical network;communication channel	Embedded	41.20012299885998	66.50861775465316	100373

It is shown that the sensitivity to the mismatched SNR depends on the channel loss and the encoder memory length. In particular, the sensitivity is more important for a “difficult-to-equalize” channel or, in other words, a high-loss channel. In fact, by affecting the equalizer and the decoder, a mismatched SNR (with an offset with respect to the true SNR) affects the convergence of the turbo detector. Using the asymptotic analysis tool of extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts, the effect of a positive or a negative SNR offset on the convergence of the Log-MAP turbo detector is studied. When no information is available at the receiver on SNR, an online estimation of SNR is necessary in order to not lose the advantage of the Log-MAP turbo detector over other suboptimalturbo detectors. In this view, a relatively simple SNR estimation method is proposed, which offers satisfying results.	bit error rate;exit chart;encoder;equalization (communications);sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;x.690	Mohammad Ali Khalighi	2003	IEEE Trans.

355b5fe2625d0530650e0a1e4e7141cb525ca178	exploration for energy-efficient ecc decoder of wban		Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) has been widely applied to biomedical applications today, in which error-correcting code (ECC) is utilized to improve reliability. In WBAN, ECC overhead can be comparable to transmit power because of the extremely short transmission distance. Therefore, as the most power-hungry component, ECC decoder should be carefully designed. In this letter, we first present an exploration for energy efficient ECC decoder in various practical scenarios of WBAN. A framework is proposed for the exploration based on an energy efficiency model of WBAN, in which all significant parameters within the design space are considered. Taking advantage of the model, we evaluate the energy efficiency of WBAN nodes when type-II Chase soft-decision decoder or hard-decision decoder is utilized. The exploration determines energy-efficient decoder for each scenario and shows that energy-efficient decoder can achieve as much as 80% higher energy efficiency than the alternative.	ecc memory;error detection and correction;forward error correction;hard disk drive;modulation;overhead (computing);soft-decision decoder	Tianchan Guan;Jun Han;Xiaoyang Zeng	2015	2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on ASIC (ASICON)	10.1109/ASICON.2015.7517208	embedded system;electronic engineering;soft-decision decoder;telecommunications;engineering	EDA	44.92545854944931	64.6779367385751	101599

Its error performance is assessed by computer simulation and is compared with that provided by other multiuser detectors.	boundary element method;channel state information;computer simulation;download;expectation–maximization algorithm;iteration;multi-user;rayleigh fading;sensor;soft-in soft-out decoder;symbol (formal)	Antonio S.

838cffee2dcaf81be63e8656a0cd0d941a83fb21	on optimal receiver for nonlinearly distorted single carrier signal		This paper deals with a Maximum Likelihood (ML) receiver for a Single Carrier (SC) signal distorted by a nonlinear Power Amplifier (PA). The well known optimal Matched Filter (MF) loses its optimality when a nonlinear PA is considered. We first propose an optimal receiver based on the ML criterion taking into account the PA nonlinearity. In case of a Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), the ML receiver has to find the minimum Euclidean distance between the received vector and all nonlinearly distorted vectors that the transmitter may send. The exhaustive search solution of this problem has exponential complexity. To reduce the complexity, we propose a sub-optimal receiver that minimizes the Euclidean distance, seen as a cost function, using the Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm. We also present a low complexity version of the GD based receiver which is suitable for a parallel processing implementation. Comparative study of Symbol Error Rate (SER) performance of the proposed receiver against the optimal SC MF based receiver is given.	additive model;additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;audio power amplifier;brute-force search;carrier wave;distortion;euclidean distance;gradient descent;loss function;matched filter;nonlinear system;pa-risc;parallel computing;rendering (computer graphics);time complexity;transmitter;vector graphics;whole earth 'lectronic link	Ilia Yoffe Iofedov;Nir Regev;Dov Wulich	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292168	real-time computing;brute-force search;additive white gaussian noise;transmitter;euclidean distance;word error rate;computer science;control theory;matched filter;amplifier;gradient descent	Embedded	45.5857013342007	74.15084196963478	101948

Our emphasis is placed on different channel estimation algorithms since the performance of a communication system depends largely on its ability to retrieve an accurate measurement of the underlying channel. We investigate channel estimation algorithms under different conditions. The estimated channel information is used to enable coherent data detection to combat the detrimental effect of the multiuser interference and the multipath propagation of the transmitted signal. In the considered multiuser detector, we mainly use interference cancellation techniques, which are suitable for long-code CDMA systems. Interference cancellation and channel estimation using soft estimates of the transmitted signal is also proposed in this paper. Different channel estimation schemes are evaluated and compared in terms of mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation and bit error rate (BER) performance. Based on our analysis and numerical results, some recommendations are made on how to choose appropriate channel estimators in practical systems.	algorithm;bit error rate;channel state information;code;coherence (physics);interference (communication);mean squared error;multi-user;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;rayleigh fading;software propagation;x.690	Pei Xiao;Erik G.

We focus on the demodulation of RSK signal at the receiver. The receiver consists of a front-end molecular circuit and a back-end demodulator. The front-end molecular circuit is a set of chemical reactions consisting of multiple chemical species. The optimal demodulator computes the posteriori probability of the transmitted symbols given the history of the observation. The derivation of the optimal demodulator requires the solution to a specific Bayesian filtering problem. The solution to this Bayesian filtering problem had been derived for a few specific molecular circuits and specific choice(s) of observed chemical species. The derivation of such solution is also lengthy. The key contribution of this paper is to present a general solution to this Bayesian filtering problem, which can be applied to any molecular circuit and any choice of observed species.	bayesian network;c date and time functions;end system;end-to-end principle;key (cryptography);list of graphical methods;markov chain;markov property;modulation;numerical analysis;state transition table;symbol (formal);transmitter;voxel	Hamdan Awan;Chun Tung Chou	2017	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2638899	chemical industry;transmitter;electronic engineering;telecommunications;electrical engineering;control theory;mathematics;demodulation	Comp.	39.87376524691568	66.73932135024978	102171

The basic principle of this structure is to make the LDC to have as many as possible the rows orthogonal in the dispersion matrices. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the optimum LDCs with this orthogonal structure have nearly identical bit-error-rate (BER) performances as other optimal LDCs. We develop a simplified Sphere Decoding (SD) algorithm that can significantly reduce the decoding complexity in decoding the new LDCs with proposed orthogonal structure. Simulation results show that the complexity reduction is more significant for MIMO system transmitting higher level modulation. For 2×4 MIMO systems transmitting 4 64QAM and 256QAM symbols in a block length of 4, the reductions are about 71–83% and 76–88%, respectively.	algorithm;bit error rate;block code;linguistic data consortium;mimo;modulation;monte carlo method;performance;reduction (complexity);simulation;transmitter;x.690	Xiaoguang Dai;Sing-Wai Cheung;Tony Tung Ip Yuk	2009	2009 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering	10.1109/CCECE.2009.5090144	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method	HPC	43.511812169873174	70.91362068566984	102269

We develop a theory of the bit error rate (BER) of MLSE-based IM/DD receivers operating in the presence of nonlinear intersymbol interference (ISI) and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise. Numerical results confirm the predictions of our theory. Based on the new analysis, we also investigate the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of the received signal yielded by a soft-input/soft-output (SISO) front-end decoder. Our study shows that traditional channel codes designed for transmissions over AWGN channels, in combination with SISO front-end detectors, achieve an asymptotically optimal performance in transmissions over IM/DD optical channels.	adaptive server enterprise;additive white gaussian noise;asymptotically optimal algorithm;bit error rate;catastrophic interference;code;interference (communication);lightwave 3d;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;modulation;nonlinear system;numerical method;sensor;soft-in soft-out decoder;spontaneous order;theory;x.690	Mario Rafael Hueda;Diego E.

This permits representing the channel as a set of parallel, uncoupled subchannels with uncorrelated noise; the representation is used to calculate the capacity of an arbitrary block coded, time discrete channel. It is shown that substantial coding gains, compared to symbol-by-symbol processing, can be achieved. The block code used can be concatenated with trellis-coded modulation so that the two coding gains are additive. >	code	Joseph W. Lechleider	1990	IEEE Trans.

We first formulated the design of a robust zero-redundancy vector quantizer as a combinatorial optimization problem leading to a genetic search for the minimum distortion index assignment. This study also presents an index assignment algorithm based on Gilbert's model with parameter values estimated using a real-coded genetic algorithm. Simulation results indicate that the global explorative properties of genetic algorithms make them very effective at estimating Gilbert's model parameters and by using this model the index assignment can be developed to respond to channel conditions.	combinatorial optimization;distortion;genetic algorithm;gilbert cell;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;parametric model;quantization (signal processing);simulation;vector quantization	Wen-Whei Chang;Heng-Iang Hsu;De-Yu Wang	1999			markov chain;probability vector;speech recognition;channel code;noise;theoretical computer science;gaussian process;mathematics;markov process;linde–buzo–gray algorithm;vector quantization;statistics	EDA	40.617593454486695	65.93303689183034	102405

For such a system, the best code known is the DjABBA code and recently, Biglieri, Hong and Viterbo have proposed another STBC (BHV code) for 4-QAM which has lower ML-decoding complexity than the DjABBA code but does not have full-diversity like the DjABBA code. The code proposed in this paper has the same ML-decoding complexity as the BHV code for any square M -QAM but has fulldiversity for 4and 16-QAM. Compared with the DjABBA code, the proposed code has lower ML-decoding complexity for square M -QAM constellation, higher coding gain for 4and 16-QAM, and hence a better codeword error rate (CER) performance. Simulation results confirming this are presented.	block code;code word;coding gain;decoding methods;mimo;simulation	K. Pavan Srinath;B.

We address the problem of high memory overhead required by layered SCMS based decoders compared to conventional Min-Sum (MS), by proposing two improvements. These require changes in the flow/rule of the conventional SCMS algorithm, in order to avoid storing the signs and the erasure bits of the variable node messages. Three layered LDPC decoders with serial a-posteriori log likelihood ratios (AP-LLR) processing have been implemented: (1) conventional SCMS, (2) SCMS with no check node message signs storage, and (3) SCMS with neither check node message signs nor erasure bits storage. FPGA implementation results for WiMAX (1152, 2304) code show that the third architecture has a resource utilization with 17% less with respect to the one implementing conventional SCMS, and with 11% less than the second architecture. Furthermore, it presents a similar cost to conventional MS, while having a 0.5 dB better error correction capability.	ap computer science;algorithm;application-specific integrated circuit;baseline (configuration management);decibel;error detection and correction;field-programmable gate array;high memory;low-density parity-check code;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;multistage interconnection networks;overhead (computing);parallel computing;routing;the matrix	Oana Boncalo;Alexandru Amaricai;Valentin Savin	2014	2014 21st IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems (ICECS)	10.1109/ICECS.2014.7049980	parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science	Arch	44.74615364365022	62.248152981562995	102641

It combines the traditional encoding/modulation mode in the signal domain with the signal pulse phase modulation in the time domain and can achieve higher information flow rate in some cases for relay networks. However, there are still many fundamental problems to be investigated. This paper considers the implementing issue of STC in AWGN relay networks. Firstly, an energy detection based STC (ED-STC) scheme is proposed and the error probabilities of ED-STC in both the signal domain and the time domain are given. Secondly, a performance evaluation criterion, the reliable information per symbol (RIPS), is proposed to characterize the performance of STC in noisy wireless networks. Moreover, the performance bounds of the RIPS of ED-STC are derived. Numerical analysis show that ED-STC outperforms traditional transmission method in terms of effective information rate within some practical conditions.	additive white gaussian noise;anisotropic filtering;detection theory;duplex (telecommunications);numerical analysis;performance evaluation;pulse-width modulation;rips;relay	Ke Xiong;Pingyi Fan;Yunquan Dong;Zhengding Qiu;Khaled Ben Letaief	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5963144	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;statistics	Mobile	40.12270417708617	71.73655361275739	103106

The scheme is referred to as turbo space-time coded modulation (turbo-STCM). It combines the advantages of turbo codes with the diversity of space-time codes. The scheme features full diversity and full rate. We also extend turbo-STCM to the case of large numbers of antennas (>2). Simulation results are provided over the block-fading channel. It is shown that this turbo scheme provides an advantage of 1.1 dB over conventional space-time codes of similar decoding complexity. The analytical union bound of the bit error probability is derived for turbo-STCM over the Rayleigh block-fading channel. The bound makes it possible to express the performance analysis of turbo-STCM in terms of the properties of the constituent space-time codes. The union bound is demonstrated for 8-PSK turbo-STCM with two transmit antennas and one or two receive antennas.	profiling (computer programming);turbo code	Dongzhe Cui;Alexander M.

In this paper, the performance of such systems when the subchannels experience correlated fading is considered. It is assumed that the channel-state information (CSI) is available only at the receiver, the antenna selection is performed only at the receiver, and the selection is based on the instantaneous received signal power. The effects of channel correlations on the diversity and coding gain when the receiver system is a subset of the antennas are quantified. Theoretical results indicate that the correlations in the channel do not degrade the diversity order, provided that the channel is full rank.

We propose a multi-function process integrating multi-user detection, space-time decoding and symbol demodulation, which can be coupled with soft channel decoding to improve the system performance in an iterative fashion. We show that the space-time coded CDMA systems approach the single-user bound with only two iterations, and full diversity LDCs enable the systems to utilize the time diversity inherent in fast fading channels. The space-time coded CDMA systems are also compared to the MIMO CDMA system based on spatial multiplexing, some recommendations are made on how to design a practical MIMO CDMA system based on the comparative studies.	ampersand;code;iteration;linguistic data consortium;mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;rayleigh fading;spatial multiplexing	Pei Xiao;Jinsong Wu;Mathini Sellathurai;Tharmalingam Ratnarajah	2009	VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073736	block code;code division multiple access;3g mimo;electronic engineering;real-time computing;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;rayleigh fading;comparative research;space time;mathematics;computer performance;space–time code;spatial multiplexing;fading;process integration;encoding;statistics;mimo	Mobile	44.65693655712768	73.9440204490535	103328

In the past, Viterbi decoders have usually been implemented using digital circuits. The speed of these digital decoders is directly related to the amount of parallelism in the design. As the constraint length of the code increases, parallelism becomes problematic due to the complexity of the decoder. In this paper an artificial neural network (A"""") Viterbi decoder is presented. The ANN decoder is significantly faster than comparable digital-only designs due to its fully parallel architecture. The fully parallel structure is obtained by implementing most of the Viterbi algorithm using analog neurons as opposed to digital circuits. Several modifications to the ANN decoder are considered, including an analog/digital hybrid design that results in an extremely fast and efficient decoder. The ANN decoder requires one-sixth the number of transistors required by the digital decoder. The connection weights of the ANN decoder are either $1 or -1, sa weight considerations in the implementation are eliminated. This, together with the design's modularity and local connectivity, makes the ANN Viterbi decoder a natural fit for VLSI implementation. Simulation results are provided to show that the performance of the ANN decoder matches that of an ideal Viterbi decoder."""	artificial neural network;binary decoder;communications satellite;convolutional code;digital electronics;parallel computing;simulation;transistor;very-large-scale integration;viterbi algorithm;viterbi decoder	Xiao-an Wang;Stephen B.

The Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the different parameters is provided first, as well as the condition for the CRLB to exist, known as Regularity Condition. Thereafter, the problem of finding suitable estimators for the parameters is adressed, for which the proposed solution is the Maximum Likelihood estimator (ML). Notation: here we describe the notation to be used throughout this document: bold uppercase A is used to denote matrices, bold lowercase a denotes a column vector and non-bold lowercase a denotes a scalar value. We use A to denote a set. Further, ‖A‖F is the Frobenius norm and A∗, AC, A and A† denote the conjugate transpose, conjugate, transpose and Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of a matrix A, respectively. The (i, j)-th entry of a matrix A is denoted using [A]i,j . Similarly, the i-th entry of a column vector a is denoted as [a]i. The identity matrix of order N is denoted as IN . If A and B are two matrices, A ◦B is the Khatri-Rao product of A and B and A⊗B is their Kronecker product. We use N (μ,C) to denote a circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random vector with mean μ and covariance matrix C. We use E to denote expectation.

The performance measure for such family of codes is the efficiency, i.e., the amount of redundancy needed to decode the information bits. Following a previous paper, we give an exact expression for the average efficiency of maximum-likelihood (ML) decoded Hamming codes and maximal-length codes. Moreover, we give an expression of the variance of the efficiency. Finally, we improve the bound on the efficiency of turbo fountain codes, which are iteratively decoded.	additive white gaussian noise;binary erasure channel;code (cryptography);fountain code;hamming code;maximal set;raptor code;redundancy (engineering);signal-to-noise ratio;variable-length code	Alberto Tarable;Sergio Benedetto	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2007.4557261	block code;reed–muller code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;online codes;fountain code;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;bcjr algorithm;tornado code;linear code;hamming code;expander code;luby transform code;mathematics;forward error correction;raptor code;error floor;statistics	Theory	40.10860278451395	64.81140182032419	103557

The PCCA-based equalizer calculates the weight vector for spatial 1lter based on signal cyclostationarity. The design problem of the PCCA is to solve an eigenproblem and 1nd the 1rst dominant eigenvector as the weight vector. In this paper, we investigate the maximum eigenvalue and express it as a function of two output signal-to-interference plus noise ratios. We also study the e6ect of small channel coe7cients on the maximum eigenvalue and present a detection method for the PCCA to guarantee the equalization performance better than a speci1ed performance requirement. Finally, several simulation examples are provided to show the e6ectiveness of the proposed approach. ? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Three different system architectures are considered, with combining achieved by dichroic mirrors operating in conjunction with a pulse-position-modulated (PPM) format. The basic criterion is to maximize the data rate with increasing number of diodes, while maintaining diode power constraints and decoding bit error probability. The three systems are: power combining into a single pulse, followed by PPM encoding; parallel channels, in which each diode is separately PPM encoded; and color coding, in which diodes are encoded over a common wavelength-time slot alphabet. Data rate equations are presented as a function of the number of diodes, mirror combining losses, PPM alphabet size, and the operating optical signal-to-noise ratio. >	diode	Robert M.

This bound is a consequence of the stability condition, and is here referred to as stability bound. In this paper, a stability bound over the BEC is developed for doubly-generalized LDPC codes, where variable and check nodes can be generic linear block codes, assuming maximum a posteriori erasure correction at each node. It is proved that also in this generalized context the bound depends only on the variable and check component codes with minimum distance 2. A condition is also developed, namely, the derivative matching condition, under which the bound is achieved with equality. The stability bound leads to consider single parity-check codes used as variable nodes as an appealing option to overcome common problems created by generalized check nodes.	battery eliminator circuit;binary erasure channel;iterative method;linear code;low-density parity-check code	Enrico Paolini;Marc P.

As the term implies, the spreading code is obtained from the random digital information source instead of the traditional pseudo noise (PN) code generators. The time-varying random codes can provide additional security in wireless communications. Multirate transmissions or multi-level grade of services are also easily implementable in SEMA. In this paper, we analyze the performance of SEMA in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and Rayleigh fading channels. Differential encoding eliminates the BER effect of error propagations due to receiver detection errors. The performance of SEMA approaches the random spread spectrum discussed in literature at high signal to noise ratios. For performance improvement, we employ multiuser detection and Turbo coding. We consider a downlink synchronous system such as base station to mobile communication though the analysis can be extended to uplink communications.	additive white gaussian noise;digital data;error detection and correction;information source;multi-user;pseudorandom noise;rayleigh fading;synchronous circuit;telecommunications link;turbo code;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Won Mee Jang;Lim Nguyen;Michael Hempel	2004	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2004.6596991	turbo code;telecommunications;computer science;statistics	Security	44.01610764418682	73.65871905111784	104075

This criterion exploits the statistical information of the channel estimates in code design. The minimum error performance can be achieved by optimally distributing the symbol-wise Euclidean distance based on the variances of the channel estimates. New codes designed with imperfect CSI are obtained using an iterative algorithm with reduced complexity. Simulation results show that in the presence of channel estimation errors, the codes designed based on our criterion assuming imperfect CSI have improved bit error probability performance compared with existing codes that were designed under the perfect CSI assumption.

The interpolated minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) and the interpolated constrained minimum-variance (CMV) solutions are described for a novel scheme, where the interpolator is rendered time-varying in order to mitigate multiple-access interference and multiple-path propagation effects. Based upon the interpolated MMSE and CMV solutions, we present computationally efficient stochastic gradient and exponentially weighted recursive least squares type algorithms for both receiver and interpolator filters in the supervised and blind modes of operation. A convergence analysis of the algorithms and a discussion of the convergence properties of the method are carried out for both modes of operation. Simulation experiments for a downlink scenario show that the proposed structures achieve a superior bit-error-rate convergence and steady-state performance to previously reported reduced-rank receivers at lower complexity.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;bit error rate;block cipher mode of operation;experiment;finite impulse response;gradient;interference (communication);interpolation;mean squared error;multipath propagation;recursion;recursive least squares filter;simulation;software propagation;steady state;telecommunications link;zero suppression	Rodrigo C. de Lamare;Raimundo Sampaio Neto	2007	IEEE Trans.

By estimating the direction of arrival of the multipaths, one would be able to limit the transmission to these directions and limit the interference to other systems. The focussing of subspaces is used to improve the resolution performance in direction of arrival estimation of wideband signals. The focussing matrix is calculated based on initial coarse estimation of DOA. The error in initial estimation results in an irreducible bias in final estimated DOA. By making use of the known pilot signals in Wimedia systems, a new focussing scheme is proposed in this paper that does not require coarse estimation. Computer simulation experiments validating this scheme are also presented. The bias in final estimation is drastically reduced.	algorithm;angle of arrival;bandwidth (signal processing);coexist (image);computer simulation;direction of arrival;experiment;image resolution;interference (communication);irreducibility;multipath propagation;non-interference (security);requirement;ultra-wideband	Ashok Kumar Marath;Abdul Rahim Leyman;Hari Krishna Garg	2010	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2010.02.091459	computer simulation;telecommunications;computer science;ultra-wideband	Metrics	51.46064319214857	73.48893964532675	105324

We have proposed a new selection method of test patterns for the iterative decoding algorithm. Simulation results have shown that the decoding algorithm with test patterns by the proposed selection method provides better error performance than a conventional iterative decoding algorithm with the same number of the error and erasure decoding iterations over an additive white Gaussian noise channel using binary phase-shift keying modulation. key words: iterative decoding, erasure and error decoding, test pattern, non-binary code	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;binary code;binary erasure channel;iteration;key (cryptography);linear code;modulation;simulation;test card;utility functions on indivisible goods	Hitoshi Tokushige;Ippei Hisadomi;Tadao Kasami	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e89-a.11.3355	block code;erasure code;list decoding;concatenated error correction code;real-time computing;sequential decoding;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;berlekamp–welch algorithm;error floor;algorithm;iterative viterbi decoding;statistics	ML	42.29354025711314	61.14654588835992	105408

Source coding is the process of compressing the source signal, and channel coding is the process of error protection. It can be shown that with no delay or complexity constraints and with exact knowledge of the source and channel properties, optimal performance can be obtained with separate source and channel coding. However, joint source-channel coding can lead to performance gains under complexity or delay constraints and offer robustness against unknown system parameters.Multiple description coding is a system for generating two (or more) descriptions of a source, where decoding is possible from either description, but decoding of higher quality is possible if both descriptions are available. This system has been proposed as a means for joint source-channel coding. In this dissertation, the multiple description coding is used to protect against loss of data in an error correcting code caused by a number of channel errors exceeding the correcting ability of the channel code. This is tried on three channel models: a packet erasure channel, a binary symmetric channel, and a block fading channel, and the results obtained with multiple description coding is compared against traditional single description coding. The results show that if a long-term average mean square error distortion measure is used, multiple description coding is not as good as single description coding, except when the delay or block error rate of the channel code is heavily constrained.A direct source-channel mapping is a mapping from amplitude continuous source symbols to amplitude continuous channel symbols, often involving a dimension change. A hybrid scalar quantizer-linear coder (HSQLC) is a direct source-channel mapping where the memoryless source signal is quantized using a scalar quantizer. The quantized value is transmitted on an analog channel using one symbol which can take as many levels as the quantizer, and the quantization error is transmitted on the same channel by means of a simple linear coder. Thus, there is a bandwidth expansion, two channel symbols are produced per source symbol. The channel is assumed to have additive white Gaussian noise and a power constraint. The quantizer levels and the distribution of power between the two symbols are optimized for different source distributions. A uniform quantizer with an appropriate step size gives a performance close to the optimized quantizer both for a Gaussian, a Laplacian, and a uniform memoryless source. The coder performs well compared to other joint source-channel coders, and it is relatively robust against variations in the channel noise level.A previous image coder using direct source-channel mappings is improved. This coder is a subband coder where a classification following the decorrelating filter bank assigns mappings of different rates to different subband samples according to their importance. Improvements are made to practically all the parts of the coder, but the most important one is that the mappings are changed, and particularly, the bandwidth expanding HSQLC is introduced. The coder shows large improvements compared to the previous version, especially at channel qualities near the design quality. For poor channels or high rates, the HSQLC provides a large portion of the improvement. The coder is compared against a combination of a JPEG 2000 coder and a good channel code, and the performance is competitive with the reference, while the robustness against an unknown channel quality is largely improved. This kind of robustness is very important in broadcasting and mobile communications.	forward error correction	Helge Coward	2001			binary erasure channel;electronic engineering;binary symmetric channel;shannon–fano coding;telecommunications;variable-length code;computer science;theoretical computer science;decoding methods;error exponent;channel capacity	Robotics	39.640238445824735	66.73431761829399	105564

Compared to the existing methods, which are based on the application of asymptotic analysis tools such as density evolution or Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts in an optimization process, the proposed method is much simpler and faster. Through a number of examples, we demonstrate that the codes designed by the proposed method perform very closely to the best codes designed by optimization. An important property of the proposed designs is the flexibility to select the number of constituent variable node degrees P. The proposed designs include existing systematic designs as a special case with P = N - 1, where N is the maximum variable node degree. Compared to the existing systematic designs, for a given rate and a given ¿ > 0, the designed ensembles can have a threshold in ¿-neighborhood of the capacity upper bound with smaller values of P and N. They can also achieve the capacity of the BEC as N, and correspondingly P and the maximum check node degree tend to infinity.	battery eliminator circuit;binary erasure channel;exit chart;low-density parity-check code;mathematical optimization	Hamid Saeedi;Amir H.

The conventional methods utilize pilot or PN sequence respectively. In this paper, we try to combine the advantage of each method together and propose a well designed state machine to control system state automatically. Moreover, as for using PN sequence, a fine PN tracking state is introduced to ensure the robustness of the proposed method. Software simulations show that the proposed method can provide large acquisition range, short acquisition time and small tracking jitter in severely distorted static and dynamic channels. Lab tests and field trials also prove its good performance in real propagation environments.	carrier recovery;control system;finite-state machine;outline of television broadcasting;pilot;pseudorandom noise;pseudorandom number generator;robustness (computer science);simulation;software propagation;terrestrial television	Weiqiang Liang;Jing Chai;Yunfeng Guan;Wenjun Zhang;Dazhi He	2008	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2007.913307	electronic engineering;real-time computing;pilot signal;jitter;digital television;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;carrier recovery;finite-state machine;helium;chinese;digital video broadcasting;bandwidth;robustness	Vision	51.94796121364078	69.83925494845028	105843

We first review a recently proposed direct shaping code for SLC (one bit per cell) flash memory that reduces wear by minimizing the average fraction of programmed cells. Then we describe an adaptation of this algorithm that provides data shaping for MLC (two bits per cell) flash memory. It makes use of a page- dependent cost model and is designed to be compatible with the standard procedure of row-by- row, page-based, wordline programming. We also give simulation results demonstrating the performance of these data shaping codes when applied to English language text. Finally, we use a random walk model to analyze the potential error propagation properties of direct shaping codes when used in a noisy memory.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;code;data model;flash memory;multi-level cell;noise shaping;propagation of uncertainty;shaping codes;simulation;software propagation;traffic shaping	Yi Liu;Paul H.

Our method assumes that the underlying error correcting code is a convolutional code. We define the notions of linear and affine equivalence among labelings. Those notions will help us to reduce the cost of the search. We show that the search is intractable with our method as the constellation size grows. In that case we restrict the search to Gray labelings. Our algorithm adapts very well to that constraint and allows an easy reconstruction up to a constellation of 256 points.	algorithm;bit error rate;convolutional code;forward error correction;sequence labeling;speedup;turing completeness	Nicolas Sendrier;Marion Bellard	2012	2012 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications		block code;gray code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;convolutional code;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;linear code;mathematics;error floor;reed–solomon error correction	Arch	41.78715441617868	60.727853264176005	106097

We specifically address the performance of BICSM over correlated Rayleigh and Rician fading channels and provide a general framework for the error performance analysis. Simulation results illustrate that BICSM provides not only significant performance improvements against channel fading in comparison to other CSM approaches but also higher robustness against antenna correlation effects.	community climate system model;convolutional code;iteration;modulation;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation;spatial anti-aliasing;transceiver;trellis quantization;unified extensible firmware interface	Mutlu Koca;Hikmet Sari	2012	2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2012.6362672	convolutional code;trellis modulation;telecommunications;rician fading;sequential decoding;computer science;correlation;modulation	Arch	41.882416679436886	71.8019357776851	106610

A block fading model is adopted where the channel fading vector is unknown, yet assumed constant during the block. For a given codebook, a competitive minimax criterion is used to find a decoder ignorant of the specific channel fading prevailing, yet its performance, relative to the Maximum Likelihood decoder, has the best worst case. For a codebook with two codewords, the decoder is found explicitly, and a numerical method is described to find its performance.	additive white gaussian noise;best, worst and average case;code word;codebook;decoding methods;minimax;numerical method;signal-to-noise ratio;utility functions on indivisible goods	Nir Weinberger;Meir Feder	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595093	fading distribution;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;channel state information;fading;statistics	Vision	41.19918282504996	72.38575789250753	107018

However, a direct conversion receiver may suffer from direct current (DC) offset, frequency offset, and IQ imbalance. This paper presents an IQ imbalance estimation scheme for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) direct conversion receivers. The proposed IQ imbalance estimation scheme operates in the presence of dynamic DC offset and frequency offset. The proposed scheme calculates IQ imbalance from a simple equation. It employs the knowledge of the preamble symbols of the IEEE 802.11 a/g standards, while it does not require the impulse response of the channel. Numerical results obtained through computer simulation show that the bit error rate (BER) performance for the proposed IQ imbalance estimation scheme has a degradation of about 4 dB with a large DC offset, frequency offset, and IQ imbalance.	bit error rate;computer simulation;eb-eye;eb/n0;elegant degradation;frequency divider;frequency offset;futures studies;modulation;multiplexing;recursion;scheme;transcranial direct-current stimulation;x.690	Hideki Minami;Mamiko Inamori;Yukitoshi Sanada;Anas Muhamad Bostamam	2009	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2009.080139	computer simulation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	51.146562473063646	73.61624972595777	107486

These techniques factorize common functions or operators and in consequence lead to compact though open implementation. However, reconfigurability is often achieved at the cost of additional configuration logic and the benefit of factorization must be carefully analysed. This paper is dedicated to a Reconfigurable Linear Feedback Shift Register (R-LFSR), which can carry out several front rank operations of multi mode transceivers (Pseudo Random Sequence Generators, Scrambling, Convolutive Coding, Cyclic coding, Reed-Solomon Coding or Reed-Solomon decoding). This R-LFSR is then used in the context of a Tri-Standards Transceiver (IEEE 802.11g, IEEE 802.16-2005, 3GPP LTE). Several architectures based on this R-LFSR structure are analysed in terms of complexity in order to select the best implementation trade-off.	analysis of algorithms;compaq lte;etsi satellite digital radio;folded reed–solomon code;linear-feedback shift register;rsa problem;reconfigurability;transceiver;triangular function	Laurent Alaus;Dominique Noguet;Jacques Palicot	2008	2008 11th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design Architectures, Methods and Tools	10.1109/DSD.2008.30	parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;software-defined radio;hardware architecture;linear feedback shift register;reed–solomon error correction;statistics	Visualization	46.43403198372995	62.278683829013715	108161

Approximate analytic expressions for the probabilities of cycle-slip detection and false alarm are obtained. They guide us in choosing detector parameters that will meet a desired performance specification. The applicability of this method is shown on artificially generated waveforms.	approximation;carrier recovery;coding gain;iterative method;signal-to-noise ratio	Xiaowei Jin;Aleksandar Kavcic	2001		10.1109/ICC.2001.936642	random variable;synchronization;detector;decision theory;telecommunications;bayesian probability;computer science;theoretical computer science;coding gain;decision rule;pulse-width modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;intersymbol interference;statistics;approximation theory	Robotics	46.435452258737506	71.12513849785182	108286

By modeling the phase noise as a Wiener process and adopting a simplified representation of an M-ary CPM signal based on the principal pulses of its Laurent decomposition, we derive the MAP symbol detection strategy. Since it is not possible to derive the exact detection rule by means of a probabilistic reasoning, the framework of factor graphs (FGs) and the sum-product algorithm is used. By pursuing the principal approach to manage continuous random variable in a FG, i.e., the canonical distribution approach, two algorithms are derived which do not require the presence of known (pilot) symbols, thanks to the intrinsic differential encoder embedded in the CPM modulator.	algorithm;belief propagation;embedded system;encoder;factor graph;job control (unix);modulation;phase noise;rf modulator;wiener filter	Alan Barbieri;Giulio Colavolpe	2006	2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference		continuous phase modulation;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics;statistics	ML	46.89864102628261	72.95402081405776	108625

Using a linear state-space model to estimate the behavior of the sum-product algorithm (SPA) decoder in the vicinity of trapping sets (TSs), we study the performance of the SPA decoder in the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) domain as a function of the LLR saturation level. When applied to several widely studied codes, the model accurately predicts a significant decrease in the error floor as the saturation level is allowed to increase. For nonsaturating decoders, however, we find that the state-space model breaks down after a small number of iterations due to the strong correlation of LLR messages. We then revisit Richardson's importance-sampling methodology for estimating error floors due to TSs when those floors are too low for Monte Carlo simulation. We propose modifications that account for the behavior of a nonsaturating decoder and present the resulting error floor estimates for the Margulis code. These estimates are much lower, significantly steeper, and more sensitive to iteration count than those previously reported.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;approximation;belief propagation;error floor;importance sampling;iteration;low-density parity-check code;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;monte carlo method;richardson number;sampling (signal processing);simulation;state space;utility functions on indivisible goods	Brian K.

The proposed ML CFO estimate is investigated under static as well as time-varying fading channels. Statistical properties of the estimator are examined and Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that the proposed CFO estimator renders excellent performance with lower computational complexity. The proposed CFO estimate also has an advantage of allowing for more flexible pilot patterns.	approximation algorithm;carrier frequency offset;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;numerical analysis;rendering (computer graphics)	Hao Zhou;Amaresh V.

It is assumed that in each subband either a primary user (PU) is active or absent in a additive white Gaussian noise environment with an unknown variance. It is also assumed that at least a minimum given number of subbands are vacant of PUs. In this multiple interrelated hypothesis testing problem, the noise variance is estimated and a generalised likelihood ratio detector is proposed to identify possible spectrum holes at a secondary user (SU). Provided that it is known that a specific PU can occupy a subset of subbands simultaneously, a grouping algorithm which allows faster spectrum sensing is proposed. The collaboration of multiple SUs can also be considered in order to enhance the detection performance. The collaborative algorithms are compared in terms of the required exchange information among SUs in some collaboration methods.

The introduction of the turbo principle allowed close approach to the Shannon limit, a theoretical boundary describing the maximum capacity of a noisy communication channel. The invention of the turbo codes and its superior performance in practical applications also initiated a renaissance of channel coding research. The exceptional performance of the turbo codes can be further improved by finding right settings for a particular system. Among others, the structure of the interleaver performing a permutation of input bits is one important property of any turbo code system. In this paper, we present genetic algorithms and differential evolution as two promising optimization methods to find a well-performing turbo code interleaver.	ant colony optimization algorithms;best, worst and average case;channel (communications);channel capacity;computation;computational intelligence;differential evolution;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;forward error correction;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;noisy-channel coding theorem;particle swarm optimization;prospective search;renaissance;simulation;software release life cycle;turbo code	Václav Snásel;Jan Platos;Pavel Krömer;Nabil Ouddane;Ajith Abraham	2010	2010 Second World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)	10.1109/NABIC.2010.5716363	concatenated error correction code;turbo equalizer;turbo code;genetic algorithm;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;linear code;forward error correction;statistics	AI	42.54217075941012	66.89656091853826	110057

We formulate the quantization search operation as a zero-one integer-optimization problem, and show that the resulting integer program can be closely approximated by solving a simple linear program. The result is a Lagrange formulation which adjoins the constraint on the entropy (codeword length) to the distortion. Unlike the previously known methods with a fixed Lagrange multiplier, we use an iterative algorithm to optimize the underlying objective function, while updating the Lagrange multiplier until the constraint on the overall rate is satisfied. The key feature of the new method is the substantial reduction in the number of iterations in comparison with previous related methods. In order to achieve some packing gain, we combine the process of trellis-coded quantization with that of FEVQ. This results in an iterative application of the Viterbi algorithm on the underlying trellis for selecting the Lagrange multiplier. Numerical results are presented which demonstrate substantial improvement in comparison with the alternative methods reported in the literature	approximation algorithm;code word;distortion;integer programming;iteration;lagrange multiplier;linear programming;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;quantization (signal processing);set packing;stationary process;trellis quantization;vector quantization;viterbi algorithm	Sasan Nikneshan;Amir K.

The errors are caused by bursts in the instantaneous frequency. We propose and verify that a nonlinear frequency discriminator can achieve zero error floor for pure FSK by clipping off these bursts. For filtered FSK, the error floor is not completely removed, but strongly reduced typically by one or two orders of magnitude. The tighter the filtering, the less effective this nonlinearity is. The nonlinear discriminator can be also used in conjunction with adaptive sampling. This work may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part for any commercial purpose.

d4ac4ae124d05ef18b4f9b2c17b74963a2ae9dd8	on the performance limits of scalar coding over miso channels		The performance limits of scalar coding for multiple-input single-output channels are revisited in this work. By employing randomized beamforming, Narula et a l. demonstrated that the loss of scalar coding is universally bounded by ∼ 2.51 dB (or 0.833 bits/symbol) for any number of antennas and channel gains. In this work, by using randomized beamformin g in conjunction with space-time codes, it is shown that the bound can be tightened to ∼ 1.1 dB (or 0.39 bits/symbol).

Asymptotic error-rate formulas for OSTBC with high average signal-to-noise ratios (ASNRs) over arbitrarily correlated Rician MIMO channels are derived in terms of the diversity and coding gains. Our results show that, in correlated fading, the phase vector phi of the channel line-of-sight (LOS) components affects the effective Rice K-factor at the OSTBC receiver output and, hence, may result in a coding gain that is significantly higher than that for independent Rician MIMO channels. Furthermore, when the channel covariance matrix is rank deficient and under some additional mild conditions, the error and outage probabilities of OSTBC achieve those in a nonfading additive-white-Gaussian-noise channel. For both cases of full-rank and rank-deficient channel covariance matrices, analytical expressions of optimal and worst case phase vectors phi, and exact upper and lower bounds of OSTBC performance are derived. These results provide new insights into the achievable performance of OSTBC over correlated Rician MIMO channels and, if incorporated into future multiple antenna systems design, will bring about significant performance enhancement	additive white gaussian noise;best, worst and average case;code;coding gain;downtime;k-factor (cisco);line-of-sight (missile);mimo;mimo-ofdm;phasor;signal-to-noise ratio;systems design;utility functions on indivisible goods	Yao Ma;Lei Zhao	2007	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2007.895580	electronic engineering;telecommunications;rician fading;computer science;control theory;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	Mobile	40.769226517367514	73.42142768822438	111561

Exploiting the signals from multiple polymorphs is important in explosives detection, whilst quantifying these polymorphs is important in pharmaceutical applications. Recently proposed hybrid algorithms, able to process the signals from multiple polymorphs, assume that the amplitudes associated with each polymorph are known to be within a scaling. Any error in this a priori information will lead to performance degradation in these algorithms. In this paper, we develop a robust hybrid algorithm allowing for uncertainties in the assumed amplitudes, extending a recently proposed robust algorithm, formulated for single polymorphs, to process signals from multiple polymorphs. In the proposed robust algorithm, the amplitudes are allowed to vary within an uncertainty hyper-sphere whose radius is evaluated using analytical expressions derived herein. Extensive numerical investigations indicate that the proposed algorithm provides significant performance gains as compared to both the existing hybrid algorithms, when uncertainties in the amplitudes exist, and the existing robust algorithm, when there are multiple polymorphs. Finally, the Cramer-Rao lower bound is derived for the uncertain data case as a reference for the quantification problem.	qr code	Naveed R. Butt;Samuel Dilshan Somasundaram;Andreas Jakobsson;John A.

Further, it is shown that the log likelihood ratio test (LLRT) statistic is the maximum likelihood estimate of the autocorrelation coefficient in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Performance of the local detector is studied for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath channels using theoretical analysis. Obtained results are verified in simulation. The performance of the local detector in the face of shadowing is studied by simulations. A sequential detection (SD) scheme where many secondary users cooperate to detect the same primary user is proposed. User cooperation provides diversity gains as well as facilitates using simpler local detectors. The sequential detection reduces the delay and the amount of data needed in identification of the underutilized spectrum. The decision statistics from individual detectors are combined at the fusion center (FC). The statistical properties of the decision statistics are established. The performance of the scheme is studied through theory and validated by simulations. A comparison of the SD scheme with the Neyman-Pearson fixed sample size (FSS) test for the same false alarm and missed detection probabilities is also carried out.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithmic efficiency;autocorrelation;coefficient;cognitive radio;flying-spot scanner;multipath propagation;multiplexing;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Sachin Chaudhari;Visa Koivunen;H.

In addition, a data-multiplexing scheme originally proposed for path-pruned codes which can guarantee smooth transition between rates without additional zero-padding for frame termination is proven applicable to the hybrid codes to improve the system throughput.	convolutional code;linear algebra;multiplexing;puncturing;throughput	Chung-Hsuan Wang;Yi-Hsin Lin	2008	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060393	block code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;electronic engineering;convolutional code;online codes;telecommunications;sequential decoding;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;linear code;mathematics;error floor;statistics	Theory	42.231099364956826	64.66075197259495	112262

Using the theory of maximum a posteriori estimation of the unknown parameter in Gaussian noise, a theoretical structure for the optimum symbol synchronizer in a system using partial-response CPM signaling is derived. As the first approximation, a closed-loop configuration, known as the early-late loop, is derived and discussed. Due to signal correlation in adjacent symbol time intervals, even this configuration is impractical for a hardware realization. For these reasons, different approximations of the general maximum-likelihood function, leading to the discrete bit timing loop realizations, are derived and discussed. The influence of the carrier phase synchronization error on these synchronizers is also discussed. >		Savo Glisic	1989	IEEE Trans.

Improvements in the performance of a concatenated coding system that uses VA decoding (inner decoder) can be obtained when, in addition to the standard VA output, an indicator of the reliability of the VA decision is delivered to the outer stage of processing. Two different approaches of extending the VA are considered. In the first approach, the VA is extended with a soft output (SOVA) unit that calculates reliability values for each of the decoded output information symbols. In the second approach, coding gains are obtained by delivering a list of the L best estimates of the transmitted data sequence, namely the list Viterbi decoding algorithm (LVA). Our main interest is to evaluate the LVA and the SOVA in comparison with each other, determine suitable applications for both algorithms and to construct extended versions of the LVA and the SOVA with low complexity that perform the task of the other algorithm. We define a list output VA using the output symbol reliability information of the SOVA to generate a list of size L and that also has a lower complexity than the regular LVA for a long list size. We evaluate the list-SOVA in comparison to the LVA. Further, we introduce a low complexity soft symbol output viterbi algorithm that accepts the (short) list output of the LVA and calculates for each of the decoded information bits a reliability value. The complexity and the performance of the soft-LVA (LVA and soft decoding unit) is a function of the list size L. The performance of the soft-LVA and the SOVA are compared in a concatenated coding system. A new software implementation of the iterative serial version of the LVA is also included. >	algorithm	Christiane Nill;Carl-Erik W. Sundberg	1995	IEEE Trans.

Moreover, this paper also tries to assess the suitability of non-binary LDPC for combination with MIMO techniques, as compared to competing binary FEC schemes such as Duo Binary Turbo Codes.

We show that the hill-like trajectory of polar code extrinsic information transfer curves allows us to predict the gap of the bottleneck region that a polar code achieves at a given received signal-to-noise ratio for a given labeling rule. Using the gap, we propose a 3-D linear objective function to optimize for error floor, waterfall region performance, and complexity. The objective function requires Monte Carlo simulations for only three points on the extrinsic information transfer curve of the demapper for a given labeling rule. Our simulations show that the proposed method designs labeling rule and polar code duos that trade off error-floor and waterfall region performance with complexity and latency.		Ubaid U.

Within this scope, Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) compensation is indispensable [2]. Its underlying algorithm requires the calculation of trigonometric functions, which is difficult to achieve by hardware implementation in general. In this paper we propose a CFO compensation approach based on low complexity and hardware optimized linear function approximation. The Multiplier-less nonuniform Piecewise function Approximation (MPA) methodology significantly reduces the calculation effort of crucial algebraic terms. Matlab simulation is performed in order to prove the results in terms of feasibility. The compensation algorithm is also implemented in VHDL and synthesized as hard-wired Integrated Circuit (IC).

The proposed estimator requires neither the knowledge of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) nor the power delay profile of the fading channels, except that the maximum delay spread L should be known and should be shorter than the guard interval. In the proposed estimator, the transmitted time-domain OFDM samples are modeled as an independent Gaussian random sequence, and the received time-domain OFDM samples are partitioned into a few subsets in such a way that the neighboring entries in each subset are uncorrelated. This is achieved by picking out OFDM samples that are spaced L samples apart into each subset. By modeling the channel gains as unknown deterministic variables, a joint symbol timing and frequency offset (FO) estimation algorithm is derived based on these subsets. Simulation results show that, in terms of lock-in probability, the proposed blind ST estimator achieves better performance than the estimators studied by Van De Beek and Speth , as well as the approximate maximum-likelihood estimator described by Lee and Cheun when the SNR is sufficiently high. For FO estimation, in terms of mean square error (MSE), the proposed estimator outperforms the estimators studied by Van De Beek and Speth at medium and high SNR. In terms of bit error rate (BER), the proposed estimator is superior to the estimators studied by Van De Beek and Speth Furthermore, the simulation results show that the performance of the proposed estimator is tolerant to the variation in the number of delay paths. This means that the proposed estimator will still adequately perform, even when the number of delay paths is time varying and is not estimated at the receiver. Finally, simulation results show that the use of virtual subcarriers has negligible performance loss in the proposed estimator.	approximation algorithm;bit error rate;frequency offset;mean squared error;multipath propagation;multiplexing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;transmitter;x.690	Ronghong Mo;Yong Huat Chew;Tjeng Thiang Tjhung;Chi Chung Ko	2008	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2007.914058	efficient estimator;minimax estimator;electronic engineering;estimator;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;maximum likelihood;consistent estimator;statistics	Metrics	50.50696848395381	74.19355643004623	113871

Decoding is done using a sphere decoder for each diagonal based on soft statistics obtained after zero forcing (ZF) or minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) filtering and decision feedback. These operations give rise to an effective parallel channel model with channel gains with nonidentical statistics and additive noise which is Gaussian in the ZF-filtering case and non-Gaussian in the MMSE-filtering case. The so-called full modulation diversity (FMD) property is nevertheless shown to yield the maximum achievable diversity orders over the MIMO channel for both the ZF- and the MMSE-filtering-based decoders respectively, for any arbitrary fading distribution. In the case of the independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading MIMO channel with K-transmit and N-receive antennas (with NgesK), these diversity orders are NK-K(K-1)/2 and NK for ZF- and MMSE-filtering-based decoding, respectively. The error probability analysis also yields a design criterion for optimizing transmit power allocations. Several lattice design methods are proposed for the effective parallel channel models. Two methods are proposed to achieve high coding gain in the Rayleigh fading MIMO channel; a third method is proposed that minimizes the exact symbol error probability (SEP) and can be tailored for any given fading distribution. A novel soft decision feedback decoder is also proposed based on the list sphere decoder to mitigate error propagation due to hard decision feedback. The salient feature of the proposed DLL schemes is that they have nearly full rate and full (or high) diversity order and yet a much lower decoding complexity than other existing full rate, full diversity space-time block codes (STBCs). The frame error probability (FEP) performance of the optimized DLL schemes for moderate-to-high spectral efficiencies and a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) can be quite close to the performance of the best performing, but more complex to decode, STBCs. Moreover, the proposed DLL schemes significantly outperform other existing MIMO systems of comparable decoding complexity.	additive white gaussian noise;blast;bell laboratories layered space-time;channel (communications);code word;coding gain;full rate;mimo;modulation;propagation of uncertainty;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;spectral efficiency;symantec endpoint protection;utility functions on indivisible goods;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Narayan Prasad;Mahesh K.

The proximity factors have been derived in literature for both primal and dual basis reduction, and it has been found that in some cases reducing the dual basis can result in asymptotically smaller proximity factors. In this paper, improved upper bounds on the proximity factors for dual-basis reduction are derived, which are uniformly smaller than those for primal basis reduction.	approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;lattice reduction;signal-to-noise ratio	Cong Ling	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.230	list decoding;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;lattice reduction;sequential decoding;word error rate;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	EDA	41.433578186286844	67.18447393468874	114176

Using Shannon's sphere-packing bounds, the capacity for this type of system as a function of the block size is shown. Furthermore, its analysis provides a comparison baseline for DS-CDMA communication channels. We compare these limits with the achievable capacity of a DS-CDMA system based on an iterative multiuser receiver (IMR).	block size (cryptography)	Jose Martin Luna-Rivera;David G. M.

Since then they have been extensively researched and applied in various ways. Compared with conventional lighting devices, the white LED has lower power consumption, lower voltage requirements, longer lifetime, smaller size, faster response, and cooler operation. The white LED will eventually replace incandescent or fluorescent lights in offices and homes. We have proposed an indoor visible light wireless communication system that utilizes multiple white LED lighting equipment. In this system, the equipment is used not only for illuminating rooms but also for an optical wireless communication system. The system has significantly higher power levels than infrared wireless communication systems, since it also functions as the main lighting equipment. One problem is we tend to install many lighting sources on a ceiling in order to illuminate the room as evenly as possible. While the number of sources permits site diversity transmission over LOS links, the optical path difference between the multiple sources triggers intersymbol interference (ISI), which significantly degrades system performance. This paper overcomes the ISI problem by proposing an adaptive equalization system. We elucidate the most effective training sequence interval for channel estimation in a mobile environment. And we show that the adaptive equalization system with the effectual interval alleviates the influence of shadowing.	access network;adaptive equalizer;algorithm;catastrophic interference;channel state information;data rate units;equalization (communications);finite impulse response;gigabit;information sciences institute;interference (communication);least mean squares filter;megabit;optical wireless;requirement;shading;simulation;wireless access point	Toshihiko Komine;JunHwan Lee;Shinichiro Haruyama;Masao Nakagawa	2009	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2009.060258	infrared;telecommunications;computer science;adaptive system;communications system;optical communication;light-emitting diode	Mobile	49.871816580577004	71.56459842641105	114594

Considering the moving target radar system, the correlation properties of the codes will not be severely affected when Doppler shift is not large.

For the iterative MIMO demapping and turbo decoding, the convergence behavior by using the informed asynchronous scheduling is first demonstrated to be similar to the standard sequential scheduling. As the extrinsic log-likelihood ratio (LLR) calculation at both the MIMO demapper and turbo decoder costs high complexity, an informed message update (IMU) rule is further proposed to select only a subset of extrinsic LLRs for updates within each iteration. By avoiding the re-calculations for the extrinsic LLRs with small changes between successive iterations, significant complexity savings are achieved with negligible error rate performance loss.	bit error rate;eb/n0;iteration;low-density parity-check code;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;mimo;scheduling (computing);simulation;turbo code;vii;windows update;x.690	Dan Zhang;I-Wei Lai;Konstantinos Nikitopoulos;Gerd Ascheid	2010	2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications	10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649576	turbo code;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics	Arch	43.9131437838616	64.30467518179655	114789

Since memory occupies half or even more area of the decoder, memory sharing techniques for area saving purpose is valuable to consider. In this work, several memory merging techniques are proposed. A non-conflict access technique for merged path metric buffer is proposed. The results show that 41% of total memory bits are saved when integrating three different decoding schemes including CC (802.11a/g/n), LDPC (802.11n and 802.16e) and Turbo (3GPP-LTE).

We propose in this paper a novel sequential algorithm w ich combines the stack algorithm search strategy and the sphere decoder search region. The proposed deco er that we call the Spherical-BoundStack decoder (SB-Stack) can then be used to resolve lattice nd large size constellations decoding with a reduced complexity compared to the classical ML decoders. The SB-Stack decoder will be further extended to support sof t-output detection over linear channels. It will be shown that the soft SB-Stack decoder outperforms o ther MIMO soft decoders in term of performance and complexity. INTRODUCTION In this work, we are interested in the decoding of multi-ante n a systems using spatial multiplexing [1] and linear space time block codes (STBC). In [2], a lattic e representation of MIMO systems is proposed. The decoding problem can then be seen as a closest l attice point search problem (CLPS) and the lattice decoders are then used. For MIMO systems, we find i n the literature mainly two classes of decoding strategies. On one hand, there are the optimal deco ders (ML) such as the sphere decoder and the Schnorr-Euchner algorithm, which have a complexity that in creases drastically with the lattice dimension and the constellation size. In the other hand, there are the s ub-optimal decoders like the ZF, ZF-DFE, Ghaya Rekaya Ben-Othman, Rym Ouertani and Abdellatif Salah re with TELECOM ParisTech, 46 rue Barrault, 75013 Paris FRANCE.

Two distinct approaches are presented, each resulting in a class of signals for which the trade-off between signal bandwidth and immunity to large-amplitude bursts is shown. Xn the first approach the design is treated as an optimization problem subject to energy and endpoint constraints in a fixed time interval, and a uniform probability distribution of the location of the burst within the interval. The second approach considers signal design as a two-player differential game, where design flexibliity is obtained through the second player’s choice of an initial value in the resulting differential equation. Performance curves for signals designed by using both methods are compared. It is shown how the first design procedure is easily extended to M-ary alphabets, thus obtaining the full advantage of the proposed technique.	bandwidth (signal processing);burst error;burst noise;communication endpoint;continuous signal;mathematical optimization;optimization problem	Howard I.

The proposed detector employs the signal-vector-based list detection method, but the original method is modified to realize a low-complexity implementation. In addition, the proposed detector is designed based on the dual-data-path architecture, in which antenna selection and symbol detection are separately performed with different precision levels to reduce the hardware complexity while achieving a near-optimal error-rate performance. The proposed detector is implemented with 87.4-K logic gates in a 0.18-μm CMOS technology, and its throughput is 858 Mb/s for 8 × 4 64 quadrature amplitude modulation SM-MIMO systems, where the operating frequency is 286 MHz, and the power consumption is 121.3 mW. This manifests that the proposed detector is very efficient with respect to the gate count as well as the energy consumption.	algorithm;ampersand;cmos;clock rate;datapath;gate count;logic gate;mimo;megabyte;modulation;sorting;throughput;x.690	Gwang-Ho Lee;Tae-Hwan Kim	2016	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2016.2536239	database index;detector;3g mimo;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;mimo	EDA	46.759846608508	63.80859225487998	115216

The properties and performance of the highrate IEEE CCK 802.11 b modulation formats are investigated and compared with the properties and performance of alternative modulation formats that are based on biorthogonal signals. Several complementary properties are derived for the full-rate (11 Mb/s) CCK signal set, the half-rate (5.5 Mb/s) CCK signal set, a full-rate signal set obtained from biorthogonal signals, and a half-rate biorthogonal signal set. Each signal set is a complementary set, but each also has stronger complementary properties. We evaluate the performance of IEEE 802.11 b standard CCK modulation, CCK with certain modifications that depart from the IEEE standard, and modulation that is derived from biorthogonal signals. Performance comparisons are presented for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and for channels with specular multipath. In particular, for AWGN channels, we provide an accurate analytical approximation for the frame error probability for full-rate CCK modulation.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation;binary number;bit error rate;code;column (database);error detection and correction;full rate;half rate;interference (communication);mebibyte;modulation;national supercomputer centre in sweden;offset binary;optimistic concurrency control;row (database);simulation;the matrix;utility functions on indivisible goods	Michael B.

c8a01a826ed7e1514346dd61536aab3a8cbb2874	total variation measurement decoding (tvmd) for reliable wireless transmission of pmu measurements in smart grids		This paper proposes a robust algorithm for wireless transmission of phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements in smart grids. The proposed algorithm exploits bounded variation (BV) property of the PMU measurements in a power grid towards minimizing the decoding error of the PMU measurements transmitted over the wireless channel, thus enhancing the reliability of communication. Further, a novel trellis based Viterbi decoder is developed with modified branch and state metrics for optimal low-complexity TV regularization based maximum likelihood (ML) decoding of the PMU measurements. Simulation results performed on an IEEE-14 bus power system employing practical models derived from a real national grid reveal the improved performance of the proposed total variation measurement decoding (TVMD) algorithm in comparison to the conventional ML decoding method and thus demonstrate the suitability of the proposed scheme for enhancing reliability of wireless communication in smart grids.	algorithm;bounded variation;decoding methods;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;optimization problem;phasor;power management unit;simulation;taxicab geometry;trellis quantization;viterbi algorithm;viterbi decoder	Ankit Kudeshia;Varun Gupta;Neharika Valecha;Aditya K.

Here, we consider high rate space-time trellis codes (STTC) with continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK). We present optimized rate-2/3 STTC implemented with 3 transmit antennas. These codes provide system throughputs of 4 and 6 bits per channel use with 4-ary and 8-ary CPFSK respectively. Simulated error rate performance of the optimized codes with receive diversity is presented. We show that although the schemes do not achieve full transmit diversity, they provide excellent coding gains compared to full rank schemes that have equivalent throughput, but higher order modulations and greater complexity.	binary logarithm;bit error rate;channel use;coding gain;color depth;convolutional code;data rate units;euclidean distance;intel matrix raid;key (cryptography);modulation;multipath propagation;simulation;throughput;trellis quantization;viterbi algorithm;x.690	Rachel L.

One inconvenience arising from that construction is that the number of subcarriers Q can sometimes be insufficient for constructing codes of large minimum column distance. To completely eliminate this disadvantage, an alternative construction of SF codes with Q = qm - 1 is provided in this paper, whenever m is a multiple of nt. Lower bounds on the minimum rank and column distances of the proposed construction are also given. Simulation results show that the newly constructed codes provide a significant improvement in SNR compared to other SF codes available in the literature.	algebraic equation;code;mimo;mimo-ofdm;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier	Mao-Ching Chiu;Hsiao-feng Lu	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.131	block code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;linear code;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;error floor;finite field	Robotics	43.5142156446797	70.49810649489051	116244

First, the capacity results of a downlink CDMA system with either multiuser detection or precoding, were obtained and compared. It is seen that the two schemes exhibit similar capacity regions for both sum rate and maximum equal rate, which motivates the development of efficient nonlinear transmitter precoding techniques to reduce the receiver complexity at the mobile units without degrading the system performance. We then develop both bit-wise and chip-wise Tomlinson–Harashima (TH) multiuser precoding methods for downlink CDMA with multipath, to remove multi-user interference, inter-chip interference and inter-symbol interference. Efficient algorithms for multiuser power loading and ordering are also developed. Implementation of the proposed TH-precoding schemes in time-varying channels based on channel prediction is addressed as well. Simulations results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in suppressing interference in downlink CDMA.	algorithm;computer simulation;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);multi-user;multipath propagation;nonlinear system;telecommunications link;test-driven development;transmitter	Inaki Berenguer;Anders Høst-Madsen;Xiaodong Wang	2007	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com:20060510	code division multiple access;transmitter;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;zero-forcing precoding;coding;implementation;precoding;channel capacity;time-division multiplexing;intersymbol interference;detection theory	Mobile	48.95343806125247	72.60752996968361	116474

A noisy decoder is a decoder running on a noisy device, which may introduce errors during the decoding process. We show that in some particular cases, the noise introduce by the device can help the Min-Sum decoder to escape from fixed points attractors, and may actually result in an increased correction capacity with respect to the noiseless decoder. We also reveal the existence of a specific threshold phenomenon, referred to as functional threshold. The behavior of the noisy decoder is demonstrated in the asymptotic limit of the code-length, by using “noisy” density evolution equations, and it is also verified in the finite-length case by Monte-Carlo simulation.	asymptote;binary symmetric channel;codec;maxima and minima;monte carlo method;simulation;x.690	Christiane L.

Although the algorithm is optimal in a joint maximum-likelihood sense, given the observed data, it is not globally optimal, since the observed data do not constitute a sufficient statistic in the absence of synchronization. On the other hand, the observed data are simple to collect, the receiver is simple to implement, and the performance obtained is robust to timing errors. Moreover, the simplicity of the observed data makes the receiver easily implementable digitally, and the need for a separate synchronizer is obviated. >		Costas N. Georghiades	1990	IEEE Trans.

This paper presents a fine timing synchronization scheme which utilizes the channel impulse response (CIR) estimated from frequency-domain samples at OFDM receivers. A maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of timing offset is derived based on the probability distribution of the estimated CIR under time-varying multipath fading. The ML timing scheme is further developed for both integer precision and real-valued precision implementations. In the real-valued timing precision case, a delay locked loop (DLL) structure is devised as an effective way to implement the MLE. Both analysis and simulations of the proposed MLE showed significant improvement over existing schemes under time-varying multipath fading channels.	channel (communications);characteristic function (convex analysis);committed information rate;decibel;delay-locked loop;frequency divider;multipath propagation;multiplexing;simulation;synchronizer (algorithm)	Hao Zhou;Yih-Fang Huang	2005	IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.	10.1109/TBC.2008.2007457	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;maximum likelihood;statistics	Embedded	50.75353090920283	74.32506371193085	116744

In particular, an iterative list branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm based on the basic BB algorithm is described to obtain a candidate list to compute soft information that is used in the iterative detector. Furthermore, an improved algorithm that uses prior information from the preceding iteration to calculate the lower bound is proposed, and the candidate list is updated every iteration. To obtain a complete modem architecture, we propose an efficient expectation-maximization (EM)-based iterative algorithm for synchronization and channel estimation to interface with the proposed list-sphere-decoding detector, and we investigate the performance of the designed MIMO-OFDM modem on a realistic fading channel. The obtained performance results show that it is possible to practically design a performing MIMO-OFDM modem with high spectral efficiency, i.e., 8 bit/s/Hz with a 4times4 16-QAM MIMO-OFDM system.	approximation;branch and bound;canonical account;carrier-to-noise ratio;channel (communications);channel state information;concatenation;expectation–maximization algorithm;forward error correction;icn gps;iteration;low-density parity-check code;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modem;modulation;multiplexing;sensor;spectral efficiency;super high material cd;transceiver;turbo code	Ahmed D.

We show that in a coded system with low code rate, a scheme with spatial transmit diversity of second order can achieve similar performance to that with spatial transmit diversity of fourth order due to the additional diversity provided by the phase shift diversity with channel coding. In addition, we also compare the decoding complexity and other features of the above four mentioned schemes, such as the requirement for the training signals, hybrid automatic retransmission request (HARQ), etc. The discussions in this paper can be readily applied to many modern wireless communication systems, such as mobile systems beyond 3G, IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN, or IEEE 802.16 WiMAX, that employ more than two transmit antennas and OFDM.	block code;cambridge structural database;channel (communications);channel capacity;circular shift;code rate;forward error correction;hybrid automatic repeat request;mimo;multiplexing;retransmission (data networks);transmitter	Chau Yuen;Yan Wu;Sumei Sun	2008	JCM	10.4304/jcm.3.4.1-7	space–time block code;principle of orthogonal design;index term;antenna diversity;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;phase;transmit diversity;second-order logic;computer network	Mobile	42.79010830772202	69.00487772541966	117126

The modulator of the transceiver provides two modes - high speed mode and low power mode. In the low power mode an uneven multi-level LINC architecture is adopted. The average-power based auto gain control is applied in the receiver to ensure the transmission quality under different paste distances and different users. The chip is implemented under 90nm CMOS technology with 5.2 mm2 chip area.

In this paper, we explore the implementation details of one such detector and present an efficient hardware architecture of it. The first step in development of this architecture is to derive a log domain version of the Gibbs sampler, an efficient method of obtaining samples of MCMC simulator. This formulation is numerically stable and can operate with low precision. The log-domain formulation also lends itself to a hardware architecture that involves only addition, subtraction, and compare operations. Moreover, pipelining can be introduced in the proposed architecture straightforwardly. We also explore the word-length requirement of the developed architecture through computer simulations.	computer simulation;field-programmable gate array;gibbs sampling;mimo-ofdm;markov chain monte carlo;monte carlo method;multi-user mimo;numerical stability;pipeline (computing);sampling (signal processing);sensor	Stephen Andrew Laraway;Behrouz Farhang-Boroujeny	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.255279	computer simulation;detector;real-time computing;quadrature amplitude modulation;gibbs sampling;markov chain monte carlo;computer science;theoretical computer science;hardware architecture;pulse-width modulation;statistics;monte carlo method;mimo	Robotics	47.002212466768896	68.75398312582699	117156

We firstly derive a tight parametric exponential approximation for the instantaneous bit error probability (BEP) in additive white Gaussian noise with parameters dependent on GFSK modulation format according to the BT standard. Then, from this expression, we derive the mean block error probability (BLEP) for DH packets transmission in Rayleigh fading channel by adopting different diversity reception techniques, such as selection diversity (SD) and maximal ratio combining (MRC). In particular, the joint impact of the diversity order, the combining techniques and the block length on the BLEP, is shown. For both MRC and SD schemes, we also obtain a tight and invertible bound on the BLEP, that enables us to analytically evaluate the quality of service expressed in terms of outage probability in channel affected by fading and shadowing and, as a consequence, the impact of multiple antennas on the system coverage.

The first one is capable of finding ‘good’ candidate lattice points soon enough and its efficiency/performance are controlled by an adaptive radius update strategy. The second is a Max-Log detector. Because of the Schnorr-Euchner nature of the search, estimation of the initial sphere radius is not required and unlike the iterative sphere detector of Vikalo et al. [1], the search step does not require any division or square root operations. In the new sphere detectors, the search step must account for the input a priories and explicit sorting of the branches stemming from the tree nodes must be done.	algorithm;generic stream encapsulation;iteration;iterative method;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;schnorr group;sensor;simulation;sorting;stemming	Michael Samuel;Michael P.

In an earlier paper [1], we computed optimal values of R(0) and Ṙ(0) for a non-fading channel, where R(·) is the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted as a function of the inverse of bandwidth B, given a lower bound on the error exponent. Based on this calculation, we defined an input distribution to be near-optimal or second-order optimal if both optimal values for R(0) and Ṙ(0) can be achieved. In this paper, we extend this result to coherent fading channels. We show that, although both BPSK and QPSK are first-order optimal, only QPSK is second-order optimal.	bandwidth (signal processing);channel (communications);coherence (physics);error exponent;first-order predicate;utility functions on indivisible goods	Xinzhou Wu;R.

The entire analysis is performed on a set of residual bit error traces, the data collection methodology for which is described in detail. These traces allow us to identify individual bit positions in a received packet that were in error. We use lagged phase space analysis, a technique commonly used in the analysis of chaotic systems. The analysis uncovers the stable nature of the BER process during short bursts. This simple behavior of the bit error rate (BER) can be captured by three parameters; the burst length of consecutive good packets, bad packets, and the distribution with which different BERs occur.

In Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems, like IEEE 802.11a and p, the most employed algorithm for performing this duty is the Schimidl-Cox, and therefore, any effort concerning to its improvement is worthwhile. In this paper, it is presented a modification to this algorithm based on a change of the timing metric, which yield an important reduction of the required computations without affecting the overall performance. The complete architecture of the algorithm is also provided and synthesized in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and CMOS technologies. Obtained results showed reduced resources consumption.	algorithm;cmos;coherence (physics);computation;field-programmable gate array;multiplexing;synchronizer (algorithm)	L.

To date, except for the cases of BPSK and QPSK constellations, good multi-dimensional mappings have only been found by computer searching techniques. This paper introduces an explicit algorithm to construct a good multidimensional mapping of 8-PSK for improving the asymptotic performance of BICM-ID systems. By comparing the performance of the proposed mapping with an unachievable lower bound, it is conjectured that the proposed mapping is the global optimal mapping. The superiority of the proposed mapping over the best conventional (two-dimensional) mapping and the multidimensional mapping found previously by computer search is also thoroughly demonstrated	id-wsf;iteration;modulation;search algorithm	Nghi H.

A modified carrier estimator that can correct frequency offsets up to two subcarrier spacings is also proposed.

In this study, a new class of space-time trellis codes, called ‘super-orthogonal trellis-coded SM’ (SOTC-SM), is proposed. These codes combine set partitioning and a super set of space-time block coded SM (STBC-SM) codewords to achieve maximal diversity and coding gains by exploiting both SM and space-time block codes. Unlike superorthogonal space-time trellis codes (SOSTTCs), which parametrise the orthogonal STBCs, these new codes expand the antenna constellation using the principle of SM. Systematic construction methods are presented for the SOTC-SM scheme and design examples are given for 2, 4 and 8 trellis states, at 2, 3 and 4 bits/s/Hz spectral efficiencies. The approximate biterror probability performance of SOTC-SM is derived and shown to match computer simulation results. A simplified maximum likelihood detection method for the proposed scheme is given. It is shown through computer simulations that the proposed SOTC-SM schemes achieve significantly better error performance than SOSTTCs with comparable complexity.	approximation algorithm;code word;computer simulation;convolutional code;mimo;maximal set;modulation;pr/sm;spatial anti-aliasing;spectral efficiency;stellar classification;trellis quantization	Ertugrul Basar;Ümit Aygölü;Erdal Panayirci;H.

fd53476bf008d3679590135c0178fb037d468695	polar codes for channels with deletions		A polar coding scheme for channels with deletions has been proposed recently, in which the information bits are pre-coded with CRC that helps to detect the location of deletions with high precision. Successive Cancellation (SC) decoding then treats these symbols as simple erasures. Given d as the number of deleted symbols, the decoding algorithm requires to check all (Nd) combinations of the deleted locations to find one that agrees with the CRC. This escalates the overall decoding complexity to O(Nd+1 log N), which is not practical even when d is a small number. In this paper, we propose an alternative decoding method for polar codes in presence of deletion errors. This method can be regarded as an extension of SC decoding to the deletion channel. The proposed algorithm is based on the recursive structure of polar codes and it directly adopts the outputs of deletion channel to perform decoding without any preprocessing. In other words, it is no longer required to check all (Nd) possible locations of the deletions. Instead, each node in the proposed polar decoder propagates its uncertainty about deletion pattern to the nodes in the next decoding layer. Eventually, with high probability, the correct deletion pattern becomes visible when the last polar bit-channel is decoded. The resulting decoding complexity is only O(d2 N log N), which scales polynomially rather than exponentially with the number of deletions.	algorithm;codec;cyclic redundancy check;deletion channel;polar code (coding theory);preprocessor;recursion;time complexity;with high probability	Kuangda Tian;Arman Fazeli;Alexander Vardy;Rongke Liu	2017	2017 55th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/ALLERTON.2017.8262788	mathematical optimization;time complexity;recursion;binary logarithm;computer science;decoding methods;small number;deletion channel;exponential growth;artificial intelligence;communication channel;pattern recognition	Theory	41.88491009039292	61.54225593289071	119168

We provide bounds both for the case when perfect channel-state information (CSI) is available at the decoder and when there is no CSI. We show that the bounds proposed can be tight enough to give reason of the behavior of these systems in a flat fading channel. We compare the results with a related trellis-coded modulation and show that the degradation in performance can be at least as low as with conventional coded modulation systems.	additive white gaussian noise;channel state information;elegant degradation;modulation;rayleigh–ritz method;trellis quantization;utility functions on indivisible goods	Francisco J.

In the proposed scheme, full diversity is achieved by use of constellation rotation and co-ordination interpolation as is the case for the co-ordinate interleaved orthogonal design, whereas the transmission matrix of the proposed code consists of orthogonal columns with all non-zero elements, alleviating the concern about high peak-to-average power ratio. In particular, the proposed code offers lower complexity of channel estimation, and exhibits lower symbol error rate than the conventional quasi-orthogonal STBC when an maximum-likelihood decision-directed channel estimator is assumed. The advantages of the proposed code over the conventional codes are demonstrated through computer simulations. In addition, the selection of the angle of rotation for the proposed design is also presented, regarding the impact of channel estimation error.	block code	Gye-Tae Gil;Dong-Hoi Kim	2013	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2011.0948	computer simulation;chip;complexity;constant-weight code;low-density parity-check code;telecommunications;computer science;locally decodable code;control theory;mathematics;error exponent	OS	44.08074955547338	73.27198467515572	119946

We propose a new adaptive linear multiuser detector based on approximate negentropy minimization of the output error and investigate its characteristics and performance. Negentropy includes higher order statistical information and its minimization provides improved converge and performance compared to traditional methods such as minimum mean squared error. The proposed algorithm is derived under the assumption that a Gaussian variable has the largest entropy among all random variables of unit variance and hence a normalization process is required. Simulation experiments show that our multiuser detector has similar bit error rate (BER) characteristics to the least BER multiuser detector. Furthermore, the proposed detector has faster convergence speed than the LBER detector. 1	approximation algorithm;bit error rate;converge;experiment;information theory;mean squared error;multi-user;negentropy;simulation;steady state;x.690	Sooyong Choi;Te-Won Lee	2003		10.1109/GLOCOM.2003.1258855	minimum mean square error;random variable;minimisation;mathematical optimization;bit error rate;theoretical computer science;gaussian process;mathematics;statistics	Vision	48.57321810642128	74.40828869310671	120080

While this approach offers a high estimation accuracy, the spectral and power efficiencies are reduced due to the pilot overhead. In the case that redundancy due to channel coding is not used for the purpose of channel estimation, the maximum pilot spacing for which a time-varying channel can be reconstructed without distortion is given by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. In this paper, it is shown that if channel coding is taken into account for channel estimation in an iterative fashion, the maximum spacing can be significantly extended, which results in an increased spectral efficiency. Towards this goal, a so-called coded sampling bound is derived. This semi-analytical bound is compared with the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. The presented results indicate that the maximum pilot spacing can be arbitrarily large given a suitable channel code and code rate.	channel capacity;channel state information;code rate;coherent;distortion;forward error correction;iteration;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;overhead (computing);sampling (signal processing);semiconductor industry;shannon (unit);spectral efficiency	Christopher Knievel;Peter Adam Hoeher	2014	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2323068	electronic engineering;binary symmetric channel;telecommunications;decoding methods;mathematics;error exponent;shannon–hartley theorem;channel capacity;statistics	Vision	39.844099976355075	72.16156965259356	120813

The approach is based on the digital phase-locked loop Kalman filter. Because the interference is assumed to be much stronger than either the signal or noise, the Kalman filter locks onto a function related to the interference. The net result is an estimate of the phase of the interference and its envelope. Though more optimum for interferer’s of constant envelope, the algorithm is characterized as a function of the Kalman filter parameters through computer simulation for narrowband Gaussian noise interference. Examples of the phaseand envelope-tracking capabilities of the algorithm are presented, followed by bit error rate curves for interference bandwidths ranging from 0.5% to 5.0% of the chip rate of the spread spectrum signal.	algorithm;arnold tongue;bit error rate;computer simulation;interference (communication);kalman filter;lock (computer science);phase-locked loop;zero suppression	Brian W.

Increasing the modulation order requires additional processing capabilities in both infrastructure nodes and mobile terminals. However, most of decoding algorithms are based either on turbo processing strategies or successive interference cancellation schemes. For mobile terminals, such strategies introduce significant decoding latency and are not compatible with parallel computing architectures that are implemented in modern devices. This paper proposes a tunable complexity scheme for multi-stream transmissions with high modulation orders (64QAM and higher). The scheme is based on lattice reduction followed by a list based maximum likelihood detection. The proposed strategy allows the same performance as successive interference cancellation schemes and offers a better decoding latency with parallel processing architectures.	algorithm;bell laboratories layered space-time;compaq lte;interference (communication);lr parser;lattice reduction;mimo;modulation;parallel computing;simplified instructional computer	Zhipeng Zhao;Loig Godard;Mohamed Kamoun	2016	2016 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2016.7565041	list decoding;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;lattice;statistics;mimo	HPC	46.056310293073835	65.99522976074604	121889

This implementation is based on digitizing a receiving signal after a low-frequency IF amplifier and performing all demodulation functions using digital signal processing techniques. Demodulation with very low overhead for TDMA is made possible by storing a burst in memory. A novel forward loop plus backward loop structure performs carrier recovery. Symbol-timing and carrier-frequency-offset estimations are performed by block processes, using the error signal resulting from differential demodulation. Bursts as short as 32 symbols can be demodulated without overhead. Since the demodulator is entirely digital and has the potential for low-power VLSI implementation, it is suitable for a portable radio system. Other advantages of this implementation include the availability of a channel quality measure derived from symbol timing estimation and the possibility of providing differential detection when it is desirable. >	carrier recovery;overhead (computing)	Nelson Sollenberger;Justin C.-I.

The joint maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator has a computational complexity that is exponential in the total number of bits transmitted and thus does not represent a practical solution to the problem. An estimator that combines a suboptimum tree-search algorithm with a recursive least-squares estimator of complex signal amplitude is considered. The complexity of this estimator is O(K/sup 2/) computations per decoded bit, and its performance is very close to that of the joint ML receiver. This receiver has the advantage that the transmitted signal powers and phases are extracted from the received signal in an adaptive fashion without using a test sequence. >	detection theory;estimation theory;multi-user	Zhenhua Xie;Craig K.

The simulation time reduction in IS depends on another probability density function (p.d.f.) called simulation p.d.f. The previous IS simulation method can not evaluate the error probability on the low SNR and waterfall region. We derive the optimal simulation p.d.f. which gives the perfect estimator. A new simulation p.d.f. design, which is related to the optimal one, is proposed to overcome the problem of the previous IS method. The proposed IS simulation can evaluate all possible error patterns. Finally, some computer simulations show that the proposed method can evaluate the error probability on the low SNR, waterfall, and error floor regions. At the evaluation of the BER of 10-7, the simulation time of the proposed method is about 1/350 times as short as that of the Monte-Carlo simulation. When the BER is less than 7 × 10-8, the proposed method requires shorter simulation time than the conventional IS method.	simulation;turbo code	Takakazu Sakai	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e88-a.10.2715	turbo code;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;error floor;statistics	EDA	45.78393910788013	71.00183888899835	122478

234e6813ee7ff82d9687fe871da006970b96b043	fast and flexible software polar list decoders		Flexibility is one mandatory aspect of channel coding in modern wireless communication systems. Among other things, the channel decoder has to support several code lengths and code rates. This need for flexibility applies to polar codes that are considered for control channels in the future 5G standard. This paper presents a new generic and flexible implementation of a software Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoder. A large set of parameters can be fine-tuned dynamically without recompiling the software source code: the code length, the code rate, the frozen bits set, the puncturing patterns, the cyclic redundancy check, the list size, the type of decoding algorithm, the tree-pruning strategy and the data quantization. This generic and flexible SCL decoder enables to explore tradeoffs between throughput, latency and decoding performance. Several optimizations are proposed to achieve a competitive decoding speed despite the constraints induced by the genericity and the flexibility. The resulting polar list decoder is about 4 times faster than a generic software decoder and only 2 times slower than a non-flexible unrolled decoder. Thanks to the flexibility of the decoder, the fully adaptive SCL algorithm can be easily implemented and achieves higher throughput than any other similar decoder in the literature (up to 425 Mb/s on a single processor core for N = 2048 and K = 1723 at 4.5 dB).	algorithm;channel capacity;code rate;codec;cyclic redundancy check;etsi satellite digital radio;error detection and correction;fastest;forward error correction;generic programming;mebibyte;multi-core processor;open-source software;polar code (coding theory);polynomial;puncturing;structured text;throughput	Mathieu Léonardon;Adrien Cassagne;Camille Leroux;Christophe Jégo;Louis-Philippe Hamelin;Yvon Savaria	2017	CoRR		throughput;parallel computing;cyclic redundancy check;computer science;source code;software;decoding methods;puncturing;communication channel;code rate	Networks	44.49332107288959	63.05898811243134	123042

The first scheme employs one pre-equalization filter (PEF) per transmit antenna, whereas in the second scheme, the simplified PEF (S-PEF) scheme, all transmit antennas share the same PEF. For both schemes the optimum finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) PEFs are calculated based on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion. Our approach is sufficiently general to include also reduced-complexity versions of pre-Rake combining that employ a limited number of Rake fingers. We show that under certain conditions the S-PEF scheme achieves the same performance as the more complex PEF scheme. We also demonstrate that a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) DS-UWB system with post-Rake combining and MMSE post-equalization is the dual system to the considered MISO DS-UWB system with pre-Rake combining and MMSE pre-equalization. This uplink-downlink duality can be exploited for efficient calculation of the PEFs and for complexity reduction. Our simulation results show that the proposed PEF schemes achieve significant performance gains over pre-Rake combining without equalization, even if only short PEFs are employed.	acoustic cryptanalysis;ampersand;causality;elegant degradation;finite impulse response;hp 48 series;infinite impulse response;mean squared error;pefs;rake;reduction (complexity);rewrite (programming);simulation;stationary process;symbol level;system analysis;telecommunications link;test-driven development;ultra-wideband;vector graphics	Elham Torabi;Jan Mietzner;Robert Schober	2009	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2009.070947	telecommunications;computer science;finite impulse response;control theory;infinite impulse response	Mobile	45.59402101837772	74.00763241034488	123502

The maximum-likelihood decoder is formulated for the case of N receive antennas and stationary, temporally white Gaussian CCI within blocks of K samples, where KgesN. The pair wise error probability (PEP) is utilized to quantify the degradation in performance resulting from the absence of side information about the CCI. For pairs of code words that differ over a large number of blocks, an asymptotic PEP performance degradation of 10log10(K/(K-N)) decibels is found. An iterative maximization of the log-likelihood function leads to an alternative suboptimal receiver with reduced complexity, including a block-wise adaptive beamforming via a sample matrix inversion (SMI) and a nearest-neighbor decoding. From the statistics of the spatially filtered signals we find the asymptotic PEP performance, and see that the presence of the desired signal, which is known to adversely affect the output of SMI-based beamformers with small sample support, is gradually mitigated in the iterative procedure	beamforming;code word;decibel;decoding methods;elegant degradation;expectation–maximization algorithm;gps signals;interference (communication);iterative method;stationary process;temporal logic	Thomas Hunziker;Jacir Luiz Bordim;Makoto Taromaru;Takashi Ohira	2007	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2007.348344	asymptotic analysis;pattern recognition;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Metrics	45.776303442927215	72.90370522226279	123599

Varying the symbol mapping complicates the sphere decoding process, particularly for the enumeration of candidate solutions within the sphere. A technique that promises quick candidate enumeration is suggested, borrowing concepts from existing closest point search schemes. The value of mapping diversity, in reducing BER and reducing computational complexity, is analyzed.	computation;computational complexity theory;mimo;nearest neighbor search;retransmission (data networks);x.690	Harvind Samra;Zhi Jun Ding	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2004.1326894	bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;automatic repeat request;statistics;computer network	Robotics	42.996704538083165	70.60035741778067	124391

Two new techniques are applied in the proposed decoder to improve the decoding performance. Firstly, a high parallelism permutation network (PN) is proposed to perform the circulant shift according to the parity check matrix (PCM) defined in WiMax and WiFi standards. By using the proposed PN, at most, four independent code frames with small code length are decoded concurrently, which largely improves the decoding throughput (2-4 times). Secondly, a fast early stopping criterion specialized for WiMax and WiFi LDPC code is proposed to reduce the average iteration number. Unlike the early works, by utilizing our proposed stopping criterion, the decoding will be stopped when all the information bits of a code frame are corrected even if there are still some errors in redundant part. Experiment results show that, it can reduce up to 20% iteration numbers compared to popular used stopping criterion.	circulant matrix;codec;early stopping;iteration;low-density parity-check code;parallel computing;parity bit;parity-check matrix;qr code;semiconductor intellectual property core;simulation;throughput	Zhixiang Chen;Xiongxin Zhao;Xiao Peng;Dajiang Zhou;Satoshi Goto	2010	IPSJ Trans.

2b118e55b32239d9021c02d4222bc468b3d987eb	position-based modulation in molecular communications		Abstract Molecular communications via diffusion (MCvD) is a new paradigm that aims establishing communications among nanomachines in a fluidic diffusive channel using messenger molecules. In general, encoding and decoding of messages are done by the number and/or type of the molecules. Concentration Shift Keying (CSK) is the earliest and simplest communication scheme that encodes and decodes information. However, due to the dynamics of diffusion, one of the major challenges in MCvD channels is Inter Symbol Interference (ISI), which degrades the communication quality in CSK and leads to an error floor. In order to cope with this problem, various solutions have been proposed in the literature. Many of them require the use of multiple types of molecules, which results in an additional cost and computational complexity. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme in molecular communications using the Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) concept that utilizes a single type of molecule and a corresponding simple receiver structure. Conventional PPM scheme is modified for the molecular communications channel and is shown to be better than CSK and other modulations in the literature, due to its robustness to ISI. Another advantage of PPM is not requiring knowledge about the channel as in other modulation schemes.	modulation	Bayram Cevdet Akdeniz;Ali Emre Pusane;Tuna Tugcu	2018	Nano Comm.

This method allows arbitrary use of the subcarriers, with no need of virtual carriers. Since the Cyclic Prefix (CP) is often longer than the channel length, the last part (at least the last symbol) in CP is contaminated by IBI to a little extent, we can use some of the symbols in CP to span the signal space for DOA-Matrix, eliminating the need of virtual carriers. In contrast to the blind methods with virtual carriers, the proposed method is bandwidth efficiency, and has lower computational complexity. We also present numerical simulation results to illustrate the validity of the method for different transmit and receive antenna configurations.	carrier frequency;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;direction of arrival;mimo;mimo-ofdm;spectral efficiency;subcarrier	Ming Luo;Qinye Yin;Aifeng Ren	2005	2007 4th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference	10.1093/ietcom/e88-b.10.4117	computer simulation;carrier signal;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;frequency offset;estimation theory;antenna array	Visualization	50.75854406880262	73.29978339027512	125382

For the unimodal channel of known phase the minimum attainable error probability for both on-off and antipodal TCS signals received in thermal noise is calculated by applying perturbation theory to the detection operator equation. For unimodal antipodal TCS signaling the threshold receiver is also considered. For channels of random phase the optimum photon-counting receiver is analyzed. In all cases the advantage of the nonclassical signal over an ordinary coherent signal vanishes as the transmittance of the channel goes to zero.		Carl W. Helstrom	1983	IEEE Trans.

In many practical communication systems a reasonable estimate of the phase of the received signal is available as the result of an auxiliary tracking operation of the carrier signal by a coherent tracking device such as a phase-locked loop. It is shown that the optimum detector for this case, which we refer to as partially coherent reception, is a linear combination of the correlation detector and the squared envelope correlation detector, which are optimum for the coherent and noncoherent cases, respectively. The error probabilities are also obtained as a function of the energy-to-noise ratio of the channel and the variance of the error in the phase estimate, which is a function of the signal-to-noise (SNR) in the tracking loop. The signal selection problem is considered in terms of these parameters.	coherence (physics)	Andrew J. Viterbi	1965	IEEE Trans.

With these ARQ techniques, the number of retransmissions is limited, and, similar to forward error correction (FEC), error-free delivery of data packets cannot be guaranteed. Bounds on the average number of transmissions, the average coding rate as well as the reliability of the schemes are derived using random coding techniques, and the performance is compared with FEC. The random coding bounds reveal the achievable performance with block codes and maximum-likelihood soft-decision decoding. Union upper bounds and simulation results show that over block fading channels, these bounds can be closely approached with simple terminated convolutional codes and soft-decision Viterbi decoding. Truncated type-II hybrid ARQ and the corresponding FEC schemes have the same probability of packet erasure; however, the truncated ARQ schemes offer a trade-off between the average coding rate and the probability of undetected error. Truncated ARQ schemes have significantly higher average coding rates than FEC at high and medium signal-to-noise ratio even with noisy feedback. Truncated ARQ can be viewed as adaptive FEC that adapts to the instantaneous channel conditions.	convolutional code;data compression;error detection and correction;forward error correction;hybrid automatic repeat request;network packet;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;soft-decision decoder;truncated newton method;viterbi decoder	Esa Malkamäki;Harry Leib	2000	IEEE Trans.

In order to achieve this incremental performance, the estimation of line-of-sight (LOS) delay with high accuracy is a prerequisite for all GNSSs. The delay lock loops (DLLs) and their enhanced variants (i.e., feedback code tracking loops) are the structures of choice for the commercial GNSS receivers, but their performance in severe multipath scenarios is still rather limited. In addition, the new satellite positioning system proposals specify the use of a new modulation, the binary offset carrier (BOC) modulation, which triggers a new challenge in the code tracking stage. Therefore, in order to meet this emerging challenge and to improve the accuracy of the delay estimation in severe multipath scenarios, this paper analyzes feedback as well as feedforward code tracking algorithms and proposes the peak tracking (PT) methods, which are combinations of both feedback and feedforward structures and utilize the inherent advantages of both structures. We propose and analyze here two variants of PT algorithm: PT with second-order differentiation (Diff2), and PT with Teager Kaiser (TK) operator, which will be denoted herein as PT(Diff2) and PT(TK), respectively. In addition to the proposal of the PT methods, the authors propose also an improved early-late-slope (IELS) multipath elimination technique which is shown to provide very good mean-time-to-loselock (MTLL) performance. An implementation of a noncoherent multipath estimating delay locked loop (MEDLL) structure is also presented. We also incorporate here an extensive review of the existing feedback and feedforward delay estimation algorithms for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) signals in satellite fading channels, by taking into account the impact of binary phase shift keying (BPSK) as well as the newly proposed BOC modulation, more specifically, sine-BOC(1,1) (SinBOC(1,1)), selected for Galileo open service (OS) signal. The state-of-art algorithms are compared, via simulations, with the proposed algorithms. The main focus in the performance comparison of the algorithms is on the closely spaced multipath scenario, since this situation is the most challenging for estimating LOS component with high accuracy in positioning applications.	algorithm;delay-locked loop;dynamic-link library;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;galileo;global positioning system;kaiser window;key (cryptography);line-of-sight (missile);modulation;multipath propagation;operating system;pro tools;satellite navigation;simulation	Mohammad Zahidul H.

Dynamic online correlation estimation is a type of newly-appearing approaches, in which the decoder estimates the virtual correlation channel between two correlated sources using both side information and the compressed SWC bitstream of the source. Since the compressed SWC bitstream usually contains partial information of the source, the emergence of dynamic online correlation estimation is helpful to solving the problem of correlation estimation in the SWC and further makes the SWC realisable. Currently, the SWC is usually implemented by LDPC codes. In this case, the SWC bitstream is just the LDPC syndrome of the source. It has been revealed that there are residual redundancies in LDPC syndromes, which can be used to estimate the crossover probability between two correlated binary sequences.

However, the adopted coding schemes in modern wireless communication standards are not sufficient for WirelessHP applications, in terms of both low latency and high reliability. Starting from the essential characteristics of WirelessHP regarding channel coding, this paper gives a detailed analysis of currently used short packet coding schemes in industrial wireless sensor networks, including seven coding schemes and their possible variants. The metrics employed for evaluation are bit-error rate, packet error rate, and throughput. To find suitable coding schemes from a large number of options, we propose four principles to filter the most promising coding schemes. Based on overall comparison from the perspective of practical implementation, challenges of the available coding schemes are analyzed, and directions are recommended for future research. Some reflections on how to construct specially designed coding schemes for short packets to meet the high reliability and low-latency constraints of WirelessHP are also provided.	bit error rate;channel capacity;forward error correction;network packet;reflection (computer graphics);throughput	Ming Zhan;Zhibo Pang;Dacfey Dzung;Ming Xiao	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2842231	coding (social sciences);channel code;wireless sensor network;throughput;computer network;bit error rate;wireless;latency (engineering);computer science;network packet	Networks	42.69202939550649	67.22110656554575	126560

The sampling jitter brings additional phase noise to the constellation pattern, thus the BER (bit error rate) performance will be degraded. This paper presents the relationship between the input frequency to ADC (analog-to-digital converter) and the sampling jitter in the digital IF (intermediate frequency) downconversion receiver with undersampling scheme. The computer simulation results with theoretical IF sampling receiver model and the measurement result with a real hardware will be presented. According to the results, for wireless LAN standard the effective IF QPSK signal input frequency of ADC was limited below around 300 MHz with RMS (root mean square) jitter of 25 ps for 40 MHz sampling rate.	analog-to-digital converter;bit error rate;computer simulation;frequency band;instability;intermediate frequency;mean squared error;modulation;phase noise;sampling (signal processing);undersampling	Minseok Kim;Aiko Kiyono;Koichi Ichige;Hiroyuki Arai	2004	The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

It is assumed that the transmitted data are completely unknown at the receiver and that the shaping pulse verifies the first Nyquist criterion. Moreover the carrier phase and frequency are considered as unknown nuisance parameters. The time delay remains constant over the observation interval and the received signal is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Our new expressions prove that the achievable performance holds irrespective of the true time delay value. Moreover, they corroborate previous attempts to empirically compute the considered bounds thereby enabling their immediate evaluation.	carrier recovery	Ahmed Masmoudi;Faouzi Bellili;Sofiène Affes;Alex Stephenne	2011	IEEE Trans.

In this paper, we propose adaptive DF (ADF)-MMSE-CE, in which the DF filter coefficient is adapted to changing channel conditions based on a recursive least square (RLS) algorithm. Furthermore, the channel estimate is phase corrected upon the reception of the periodically inserted pilot chip blocks. The average BER performance of DS-CDMA with MMSE-FDE using ADF-MMSE-CE is evaluated by computer simulation in a frequencyselective Rayleigh fading channel and the simulation results show that our proposed scheme is very robust against fast fading. key words: DS-CDMA, frequency-domain equalization, adaptive decision feedback, channel estimation	adobe framemaker;algorithm;channel state information;coefficient;computer simulation;direction finding;mean squared error;rayleigh fading;recursion;recursive least squares filter;x.690	Le Liu;Fumiyuki Adachi	2007	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e90-b.8.1997	computer simulation;telecommunications;computer science;accuracy and precision;channel state information;statistics	Mobile	50.22721599241074	73.15895852205799	127082

The magnetic recording and optical recording systems fall under such class of channels [5]. For these channels, a concatenated coding scheme consisting of an outer Reed-Solomon (RS) and an inner parity code with single bit parity or multiple parity bits is commonly used. The inner parity code is usually not decoded using a trellis to limit the computation overhead. Instead, the parity code is decoded by using a post-processor which comprises of a bank of filters. The reduced complexity post-processor using information reuse for decoding the inner parity code is first proposed. A variant of the post-processor is then developed to enable generate soft-output based on the DEE. The performance of the soft-output algorithm is close to the Soft-Output Viterbi Algorithm (SOVA), if the dominant error event list is appropriately chosen. The advantage is that the computational cost is much lesser compared to the SOVA. Conceptually, the proposed reduced-complexity SOVA does not consider all the paths in the trellis for computing the soft-output, rather it uses only on the DEE based paths to generate the soft output.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;cross-interleaved reed–solomon coding;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;magnetic storage;mike lesser;norm (social);overhead (computing);parity bit;soft output viterbi algorithm;trellis quantization	Ravi Motwani;Tom Souvignier	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683223	multidimensional parity-check code;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;reed–solomon error correction;statistics	Robotics	42.81005229803962	61.68978231243467	127437

The proposed coding scheme uses a set of n convolutional codes multiplexed into an inner code and a (n, n 1) single-parity-check code serving as the outer code. Each of the inner convolutional codes is decoded independently with maximum-likelihood decoding being achieved via n parallel implementations of the Viterbi algorithm. The Viterbi decoding is followed by additional outer soft-decision single-parity-check decoding. Considering n = 12 and the set of short constraint length K = 3, rate 1/2 convolutional codes, it is shown, that the performance of the concatenated scheme is comparable to the performance of the constraint length K = 7, rate 1/2 convolutional code with standard soft-decision Viterbi decoding. Simulation results are presented for the K = 3, rate 1/2 as well as for the punctured K = 3, rate 2/3 and rate 3/4 inner convolutional codes.

145aa9142d63dda8928ac9f8bc986a426aa6c996	set message-passing decoding algorithms for regular non-binary ldpc codes		In the check node (CN) update of non-binary message-passing algorithms, each element of reliability vectors takes the same computational complexity. However, our analysis indicates that various elements in the same vector have various correct probabilities, thus have different contributions to error performance. In order to match computational complexity with correct probability, all elements in a vector are partitioned into different sets. For the extended min-sum (EMS) decoding, various strategies are applied for sets according to their correct probability. For the trellis-based EMS decoding, it is interesting that set partition only involves fixed paths, thus it does not need to search over the whole trellis of a CN. Complexity analysis and simulation results show that the proposed algorithms efficiently decode non-binary low-density parity-check codes, including ultra-sparse ones.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;low-density parity-check code;message passing;multistage interconnection networks;simulation;sparse matrix;trellis quantization	Qin Huang;Liyuan Song;Zulin Wang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2746101	concatenated error correction code;berlekamp–welch algorithm;low-density parity-check code;decoding methods;list decoding;computational complexity theory;algorithm;sequential decoding;computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes	Theory	42.7943583211279	60.67212904276652	127756

For wideband DS/CDMA signals, multipath distortion is well modeled by a finite-impulse response filter. In this work, a blind channel identification technique based on second-order statistics is investigated. The method exploits knowledge of the spreading code of the user of interest via matched filtering, as well as properties of spreading codes. The current scheme focuses on a method appropriate for randomized long sequence DS/CDMA. This access scheme poses special challenges as the spreading codes are time varying. An analytical approximation of the mean-squared error is derived using perturbation techniques.

A particular TH code, selected by log2 M-bit data, modulates the basic pulses (i.e., determines the location of the pulses), that are additionally time-shifted by binary PPM (BPPM), resulting in combined MCSK and BPPM (i.e., """"MCSK/BPPM""""). The combined modulation achieves increased data rate with respect to conventional TH-BPPM without affecting pulse shaping and can further improve the bit-error-rate (BER) performance. MCSK, which can also be employed by itself or combined with binary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), is also shown to outperform TH M-ary PPM in dense multipath as it increases the diversity gain through randomized pulse locations."""	binary logarithm;bit error rate;code;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;key (cryptography);multipath propagation;noise shaping;pulse shaping;pulse-width modulation;randomized algorithm;ultra-wideband;uncompressed video;x.690	Serhat Erküçük;Dong In Kim	2007	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2007.05803	telecommunications;computer science;ultra-wideband	Mobile	43.649814323524495	73.66617425917173	128481

Unfortunately, OSTBCs lack in array gain compared with beamforming techniques and suffer a rate loss for more than two transmit antennas. One simple method for improving the array gain and adapting OSTBCs to any number of transmit antennas is antenna-subset selection, where the OSTBC is transmitted on a subset of the transmit antennas. In this letter, we analyze the symbol-error rate performance of antenna-subset selection combined with OSTBCs.	beamforming;code;selection algorithm	David James Love	2005	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858655	block code;electronic engineering;telecommunications;probability of error;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Vision	42.718566456559756	73.19035919416191	128566

Specifically, the LDPCCC is derived from a quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC block code. By making use of the quasi-cyclic structure, the proposed LDPCCC decoder adopts a dynamic message storage in the memory and uses a simple address controller. The decoder efficiently combines the memories in the pipelining processors into a large memory block so as to take advantage of the data-width of the embedded memory in a modern field-programmable gate array (FPGA). A rate-5/6 QC-LDPCCC has been implemented on an Altera Stratix FPGA. It achieves up to 2.0 Gb/s throughput with a clock frequency of 100 MHz. Moreover, the decoder displays an excellent error performance of lower than 10-13 at a bit-energy-to-noise power-spectral-density ratio (Eb/N0) of 3.55 dB.	block code;central processing unit;clock rate;codec;convolutional code;eb/n0;embedded system;error floor;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;gigabyte;low-density parity-check code;noise power;overhead (computing);pipeline (computing);selective calling;spectral density;stratix;throughput	Chiu-Wing Sham;Xu Chen;Francis Chung-Ming Lau;Yue Zhao;Wai Man Tam	2013	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2012.2230506	concatenated error correction code;turbo code;electronic engineering;convolutional code;parallel computing;low-density parity-check code;soft-decision decoder;sequential decoding;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;linear code;error floor;field-programmable gate array	Embedded	44.816469308212845	62.69273080570864	128628

Comparisons between the results obtained by this analytical expression and results obtained by computer simulations show that the analytical results are accurate for a broad range of channel parameters. The Gilbert-Elliott model is then used to compare the performance of different binary BCH codes when the delay constraint does not allow the assumption of infinite interleaving. In contrast to the memoryless case, where the performance typically is improved with increased block length, short codes are found to be as good, or even superior, due to the fact that the interleaver works better for shorter codes.	forward error correction;gilbert cell	Leif Wilhelmsson;Laurence B.

Therefore, using one modulation type cannot fulfill all the channel conditions and receivers. Conventional adaptive modulation selection schemes are based on packet loss statistics or SNR measurement. However, all of these methods are indirect approaches because they utilize the packet loss rate or SNR information to estimate the BER approximately and the modulation selection that based on these approximate results is not exactly. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to utilize the error estimating code (EEC) which directly represents the BER information to realize a new adaptive modulation selection scheme. Compared to traditional adaptive modulation type selection schemes, our scheme needs only a small amount of overhead and very little computational cost for the same performance.	adaptive filter;adaptive grammar;algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;complexity;computation;encoder;modulation;multipath propagation;network packet;overhead (computing);redundancy (information theory);signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;x.690	Qing Li;Bin Li;Yu Liu;Lin Zhang	2011	2011 Seventh International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks	10.1109/MSN.2011.14	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	42.30033140070818	66.29353133871706	128676

Efficient decoding algorithm and hardware implementation of LDPC code is an important issue. The paper proposes an improved version of the Normalized Min-Sum (NMS) decoding algorithm named “Girth-Aware NMS”. The principle of the GA-NMS is to determine “offline” the optimal normalisation factor of the extrinsic message using the structure property of the Tanner Graph associated to the LDPC matrix. The idea can be expressed simply: a check node implied in one, or more, cycle of minimum size (the so-called Girth) in the Tanner Graph is more subjected to self-confirmation than other check nodes. Thus, the extrinsic messages generated by this type of check nodes should be more aggressively “normalized” (or attenuated) than other check nodes. In the context of the IEEE P802.16e standard (WIFI standard), simulation results of the GA-NMS shows both improved decoding performance and reduced average number of decoding iterations.	algorithm;bit error rate;cyclic redundancy check;forward error correction;ieee 754-1985;iteration;low-density parity-check code;mathematical optimization;no man's sky;online and offline;performance;simulation;software release life cycle;tanner graph	Abdelilah Kadi;Mostafa Mrabti;Said Najah;Emmanuel Boutillon	2016	2016 International Conference on Advanced Communication Systems and Information Security (ACOSIS)	10.1109/ACOSIS.2016.7843926	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science	HPC	43.809103457618484	66.90238609125049	128766

The theory originates from the transmission system environment, which consists of three basic building blocks-multiplexer, scrambler, and permuter. These building blocks are represented by mathematical operators, on the basis of which mathematical expressions of the whole transmission system become possible. The mathematical operators are directly translated into number operators which help detect and identify the received signals in the form of a table-the signal-detection table. The signal-detection tables play a central role in the signal-alignment theory, since any transmission system can be represented by its corresponding signal-detection table. The entries in the signal-detection tables are closely correlated so that the tables can be uniquely characterized by their corresponding characteristic expressions. Various types of signal-detection tables are examined, and solutions to align transmitted signals and to reduce signal-alignment time in rolling-based lightwave transmission systems are exemplified through scrambler-permuter configurations. >	lightwave 3d	S.

This paper proposes an Adaptive Erasure Belief Propagation (AE-BP) decoding algorithm to reduce the influence of these unreliable messages. The idea behind AE-BP is recording the continuous fluctuant times of variable nodes by introducing a sequence of counters, and then adaptively erasing the messages according to their fluctuant times so that other messages would recover to more precise states. Semi-Gaussian approximation demonstrates adaptive erasure is a good candidate towards offsetting the defect of unreliable messages. Experimental simulations show that, for LDPC codes AE-BP outperforms most decoding algorithms in the literature.	algorithm;approximation;backpropagation;belief propagation;code (cryptography);iterative method;low-density parity-check code;performance;qr code;r language;simulation;software bug;software propagation	Chaonian Guo;Xiangxue Li;Dong Zheng;Shengli Liu;Jianhua Li	2009	2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC	10.1109/NCM.2009.15	list decoding;probability density function;low-density parity-check code;bit error rate;sequential decoding;theoretical computer science;probability of error;gaussian process;statistics;belief propagation;approximation theory	HPC	41.482703526645906	62.65521704483925	129142

The key idea of the proposed companding technique is to compress (i.e., down-weight) the dubious observation of the accumulated branch metric by taking into account its statistical characteristics so that, after companding, the estimation error of the unreliable detected information bits due to insufficient candidate size and/or channel estimation error is significantly mitigated without disproportionate compromise of the reliable information bits. By employing the proposed companding method, the original leptokurtically distributed log-likelihood ratio of the detected information bits becomes more Gaussian distributed. As an illustrative example, the QRD-M detector is employed in this paper. Numerical results show that the QRD-M detector based on the proposed companding paradigm achieves significant performance gain over the conventional method and approaches the performance of the ML detector for a 16-ary quadrature-amplitude-modulated (16-QAM) 4×4 MIMO multiplexing system with lower-than-linear-detector computational complexity.	agent-based model;algorithm;boolean algebra;channel state information;code rate;companding;computational complexity theory;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;mimo;modulation;multiplexing;nonlinear system;programming paradigm;qr decomposition;sensor;x.690	Xiaoming Dai;Runmin Zou;Jianping An;Xiangming Li;Shaohui Sun;Yingming Wang	2012	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2012.2183008	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;quadrature amplitude modulation;a-law algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;companding;control theory;mathematics;g.711;statistics	Visualization	46.450658281426996	71.76279756147188	129241

Within this context, we propose algorithmic improvements on the rate matching procedure, which are applied to the TE output streams, and to the corresponding rate de-matching at the receiver side, respectively. The proposed method facilitates an address assigner that on-the-fly controls the memory addressing operations by defining the interleaving/ puncturing of bits to be transmitted. The usage of this controller leads to a significant latency reduction and to the utilization of low memory resources when compared with other conventional approaches deduced by the LTE standard.	code rate;compaq lte;forward error correction;memory address;puncturing;test engineer;turbo code	Angelos Spanos;Fotios Gioulekas;Michael K.

In this paper, only the sign bits of correlator results are used to estimate the frame and the frequency offset, and for the sake of reducing complexity and power consumption, we also present other two methods.

Capacity-approaching codes such as turbo and LDPC codes, discovered or rediscovered in the past decade, offset near-Shannon-limit performance on the AWGN channel with rather low implementation complexity and are therefore increasingly being applied for error control in various fields of data communications. This article describes a generic multilevel modulation and coding scheme based on the use of turbo-like, or LDPC codes for DSL system. It is shown that such codes provide significant gains in performance and allow an increase in data rate and/or loop reach that can be instrumental to the widespread deployment of future DSL services. Such techniques are also suitable for general multilevel modulation system in other application areas.	additive white gaussian noise;data compression;delta-sigma modulation;digital subscriber line;error detection and correction;floor and ceiling functions;low-density parity-check code;noisy-channel coding theorem;pulse-width modulation;qr code;shannon (unit);software deployment;uncompressed video	Evangelos Eleftheriou;Sedat Ölçer;Hamid R.

The method also minimizes the number of antennas to the number of signals and adapts continuously to maintain performance in a mobile environment where users (signals) come and go. It ensures that the amount of computation is kept to a minimum and, in a practical system, can reallocate computational resources to other applications. The technique is a modification of the matrix decomposition method of Cozzens and Sousa. A new set of stability, stopping, and adaptive control criteria is presented. An algorithm is formulated, and simulation results are presented, showing performance and behavior at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

Based on reducing the correlation of spatial shaping pulses between the multiplexed streams, this approach can be used to solve the problem of detection in the ill-conditioned channel matrix. It is shown that at the receiver, the reduction of the correlation enables the requirement on the number of the receive antennas to be removed by the zero forcing (ZF) detector compared with the conventional synchronous layered space-time architecture. First, this paper presents how to exploit the correlation of spatial shaping pulses between the multiplexed streams. Then deriving the exact closed-form expression of error rate for the proposed scheme, this paper finds that the maximum possible diversity gain can be achieved based on the independent layered architecture by the ZF detector at the cost of limited multiplexing gain.	code;condition number;mimo;mimo-ofdm;noise shaping;simulation;spatial multiplexing;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Shihai Shao;Youxi Tang;Wanzhi Ma	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/TWC.2009.071054	telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;spatial multiplexing;fading;statistics	Mobile	43.786383184175236	73.9580976229047	130013

Analysis for the anticollision problem can be divided into two primary parts. The concern of the first part is how to precisely estimate the number of tags. The other part involves determination of dynamic frame length to achieve maximum throughput or channel usage efficiency. In this paper, we present an accurate method for estimating tag quantity. This method is based on the maximum a posteriori probability decision. We also derive the optimal frame length using radio channel efficiency. Simulation results indicate the tag estimate error of the proposed method is less than 4%. Use of our proposed tag estimate method together with optimal frame length can achieve close to the theoretical maximum throughput of the framed ALOHA algorithm.	algorithm;maximum throughput scheduling;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;simulation;tag (metadata);telecommunications link	Wen-Tzu Chen	2009	IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/TASE.2008.917093	radio-frequency identification;electronic engineering;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	47.66031745267148	70.96736528894647	130301

One of the main challenges in MCvD is the intersymbol interference (ISI), which inhibits communication at high data rates. Furthermore, at nanoscale, energy efficiency becomes an essential problem. Before addressing these problems, a predetermined threshold for the received signal must be calculated to make a decision. In this paper, an analytical technique is proposed to determine the optimum threshold, whereas in the literature, these thresholds are calculated empirically. Since the main goal of this paper is to build an MCvD system suitable for operating at high data rates without sacrificing quality, new modulation and filtering techniques are proposed to decrease the effects of ISI and enhance energy efficiency. As a transmitter-based solution, a modulation technique, molecular transition shift keying (MTSK), is proposed in order to increase the data rate by suppressing ISI. Furthermore, for energy efficiency, a power adjustment technique that utilizes the residual molecules is proposed. Finally, as a receiver-based solution, a new energy efficient decision feedback filter (DFF) is proposed as a substitute for the conventional decoders in the literature. The error performance of DFF and MMSE equalizers are compared in terms of bit error rates, and it is concluded that DFF may be more advantageous when energy efficiency is concerned, due to its lower computational complexity.	bit error rate;catastrophic interference;computational complexity theory;digital forensics framework (dff);filter (signal processing);information sciences institute;interference (communication);key (cryptography);modulation;transmitter;uncompressed video	Burcu Tepekule;Ali Emre Pusane;Huseyin Birkan Yilmaz;Chan-Byoung Chae;Tuna Tugcu	2015	IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications	10.1109/TMBMC.2015.2501745	transmitter;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;encoding;modulation	EDA	44.66002076515167	65.71501026382852	130437

Received samples are observed over a window of length equal to that of the preamble and a metric is computed for each sample shift of the window. A metric exceeding a noise dependent pre-computed threshold flags the presence of a preamble. The preamble sequence consists of concatenated sections of spreading sequences whose length is at most the coherence time of the channel. These sections are then differentially combined. A differential correlation-based detection is employed to locate the boundaries of the preamble. A theoretical framework is developed to provide exact analytical solutions for missing and falsely detecting a preamble using matrix analysis of quadratic Gaussian statistics. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed methodology in a two path channel is studied. The effects of frequency and timing offsets on the system performance is evaluated. Simulation results are presented to validate the analytical expressions. Additionally, a performance comparison of the proposed differential detection scheme with that of a noncoherent square-law detector is presented.	additive white gaussian noise;concatenation;matrix analysis;network packet;precomputation;sensor;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Sumeeth Nagaraj;Sheehan Khan;Christian Schlegel;Marat V.

The MIMO-OFDM system makes joint use of channel coding and orthogonal space-frequency block coding (OSFBC) on the transmit side and iterative processing on the receiver side for robustness and improved performance against the fading and MTI effects of the channel. The new iterative receiver is implemented by either an optimal a posteriori probability (APP) space-frequency detector or a soft-information-aided minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) combiner at its front end and a soft-input-soft-output channel decoder at its back end. An approximate error performance analysis is provided for the OSFBC-OFDM system under maximum-likelihood decoding to illustrate the interference mitigation efficiency of the system. Then, the two iterative receivers are compared in terms of their computational complexities and bit error rate (BER) performances. As depicted in the BER graphs, both iterative receivers provide an improvement in performance after only a few detection/decoding iterations. It is also shown that despite its suboptimality, the MMSE receiver has the potential to achieve a BER performance close to that of the APP detector at a significantly lower cost.	analysis of algorithms;approximation algorithm;bit error rate;decoding methods;diplexer;forward error correction;interference (communication);iteration;mimo;mimo-ofdm;moving target indication;multipath propagation;multiplexing;performance;x.690	Celal Esli;Mutlu Koca;Hakan Deliç	2007	2007 15th European Signal Processing Conference	10.1109/TVT.2007.912609	block code;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	45.51363900314391	72.38019665989754	130830

However, despite offering several advantages, MC systems have certain weak points. One is their high sensitivity to interchannel interference (ICI). The influence of Doppler shift and ICI are the focus of this paper. Newly proposed B3G/4G systems are developed for data transmission rates higher than those of the IEEE 801.11. It is then necessary that the bandwidth of the subcarrier be small. Moreover, for a higher carrier frequency and mobile speed, the influence of the Doppler shift will be large; therefore, the influence of ICI becomes severer. Using a Markov chain approach, we synthesized a turbo equalizer (TE) that minimizes ICI when interference affects the arbitrary number M of adjacent subchannels. This approach shows the complexity of the proposed algorithm exhibits linear growth with respect to M and independence with respect to the total number of subchannels in the multicarrier system. The proposed ICI cancellation scheme can also be effective in the case of multiple Doppler frequency offsets. This makes the proposed approach attractive for practical implementations. key words: OFDM, DMT, multicarrier system, interchannel interference, turbo-equalizer, frequency offset	algorithm;carrier frequency;catastrophic interference;digital monetary trust;doppler echocardiography;doppler effect;equalization (communications);frequency offset;ici (programming language);interference (communication);linear function;markov chain;subcarrier;turbo equalizer;upwind scheme	Alexander N.

For 3-bit soft decision detected signals, coding gain within 0.06 dB of Viterbi at 3-dB SNR is achieved for the same constraint-length code with modest parameter values and computational effort. At values of SNR above 6 dB, the algorithm decodes with very low computational effort. Effort levels are controlled by spanning the decoding trellis in steps that are one constraint-length long.	coding gain;computation;convolutional code;file spanning;signal-to-noise ratio;trellis quantization;viterbi algorithm	Christian Feldmann;Jay H.

However, there is no literature on its convergence analysis. Further, existing analyses of the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm assume that the input signals are jointly Gaussian, an assumption that is invalid for PR equalization with binary input. In this paper, we present a novel method to analyze the convergence of the LCLMS algorithm, without the Gaussian assumption. Our approach accommodates distinct step sizes for equalizer and PR target. It is shown that the step-size range required to guarantee stability of LCLMS with binary data is larger than that with Gaussian data. The analytical results are corroborated by extensive simulation studies.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive histogram equalization;approximation algorithm;assistive technology;binary data;equalization (communications);least mean squares filter;simulation	Sze Chieh Lim;George Mathew;Michael Anthonio	2006	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2005.861069	computer vision;speech recognition;least mean squares filter;telecommunications;computer science	ML	49.49823311771642	73.91386063938968	130997

While the YGT code uses a specially designed symbol constellation, the new code uses a conventional QAM with a rotation. At a high data rate such as 3 bps/Hz, the new design with symbol-wise decoding complexity can even yield a lower error rate than the code by Zhu and Jafarkhani that has the pair-wise decoding complexity.	block code;coding gain;transmitter;uncompressed video	Yu Chang;Yingbo Hua;Brian M.

By utilizing a Gaussian approximation for Rician random variables, we express the pairwise error probability as a function of the equivalent normalized squared distance (ENSD). ENSD plays the same role as normalized squared Euclidean distance when evaluating error probability performance for coherent detection. We derive an analytical approximation on the bit-error probability by employing ENSD for both the coded system and the uncoded system. For the uncoded system we show that the bit-error probability of noncoherent detection approaches that of coherent symbol-by-symbol detection in the limit as the multiplicity of the symbol goes to infinity for large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), We determine specific optimal trellis encoders for binary and 4-ary CPFSK with modulation index 1/2 and 1/4, respectively, by application of Ungerboeck's (1982) set partitioning approach.	key (cryptography);modulation;trellis quantization	Ho-Kyoung Lee;Charles L.

31313fc9b6fc7cda94a3f504a25a5f8482560e36	an accurate and efficient method to calculate the error statistics of block-based approximate adders		Adders are key building blocks of many error-tolerant applications. Leveraging the application-level error tolerance, a number of approximate adders were proposed recently. Many of them belong to the category of block-based approximate adders. For approximate circuits, besides normal metrics such as area and delay, another important metric is the error measurement. Given the popularity of block-based approximate adders, in this work, we propose an accurate and efficient method to obtain the error statistics of these adders. We first show how to calculate the error rates. Then, we demonstrate an approach to get the exact error distribution, which can be used to calculate other error characteristics, such as mean error distance and mean square error.	approximation algorithm;bit numbering;error-tolerant design;mean squared error;monte carlo method;sampling (signal processing)	Yi Wu;You Li;Xiangxuan Ge;Weikang Qian	2017	CoRR		theoretical computer science;statistics	ML	41.44947316504366	62.63805605960135	131423

The environments considered herein have multiple primary transmitter/receiver pairs and one secondary transmitter/receiver pair using the same frequency band. In this scenario, we develop the opportunistic power control method for assisting successive interference cancellation (SIC) and optimal SIC order. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the ST transmission rate significantly when compared to the method with no power control, and it exhibits a small throughput loss compared to the optimal technique while offering simpler implementation and using less transmission power.	bell laboratories layered space-time;computational complexity theory;control theory;frequency band;interference (communication);simplified instructional computer;simulation;throughput;transmitter	Yong-Up Jang;Eui-Rim Jeong	2011	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2011.011311.101891	transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing	Mobile	48.88068300737548	72.36426545403735	131452

Multiplexing introduces correlation between userspsila data, which offers effectively longer codes and facilitates high-performance iterative multi-user decoding at the destination. Additionally, space time block coding makes bit-metrics calculation simple and increases spatial diversity of the received signal. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms direct transmission under the same transmit power and bandwidth efficiency.	code;discrete cosine transform;iteration;iterative method;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;parity bit;relay channel;retransmission (data networks);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency	Ho Van Khuong;Tho Le-Ngoc	2008	2008 Second International Conference on Communications and Electronics	10.1016/j.sigpro.2009.04.003	block code;electronic engineering;antenna diversity;metric;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;mathematics;antenna array;multiplexing;statistics	Mobile	48.269492089036966	72.04039101349647	131498

The size of smallest stopping set is called the stopping distance. Since it depends on the structure of parity-check matrix for the code, we can construct the parity-check matrix by adding dependent rows so that the stopping distance is equal to the minimum distance. The stopping redundancy is defined as the smallest number of rows in such a parity-check matrix. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic algorithm for computing the stopping redundancy of LDPC codes. Additionally, we show numerical results of computing the stopping redundancy of (155,64), (504,252) and (1008,504) LDPC codes.	binary erasure channel;computation;iteration;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;numerical analysis;parity-check matrix;probabilistic turing machine;qr code;randomized algorithm;tanner graph	Masanori Hirotomo;Yoshiho Konishi;Masakatu Morii	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2009.5205954	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;theoretical computer science;mathematics;error floor;statistics	Theory	40.62809680904647	60.96385587049596	131724

An investigation of possible applications in space communications to fixed and mobile platforms is addressed here. Mobile satellite communications has been advanced over the past few years with introduction of several new operational systems (e.g., Thuraya, Globalstar, and Irridium), in addition to the existing INMARSAT and Mobile Satellite Ventures systems. In particular, satellite communications with aircraft are currently receiving considerable development attention. With the potentially large number of users, many issues require attention, particularly interference mitigation for improving signal quality. In this paper, stochastic gradient algorithms, based on the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm, and Transform based LMS are used in illustrative applications. The type of algorithm chosen affects both the speed of convergence and the complexity of implementation. Several simulation results are provided using models built to study these applications. Among these applications are channel identification, adaptive channel equalization, interference rejection of narrow band signals within wide band signals, and phased array antenna beam forming.	adaptive filter;communications satellite	Mohammed A.

A reference signal is embedded in the transmitted signal with little power consumption and no spectral overhead introduced, to enable ambiguity elimination for the ICA output signal at the receiver. Moreover, channel interpolation is incorporated with layered space frequency equalization (LSFE) to enhance the system performance. Simulation results show that the proposed implicit compensation scheme can not only provide a better bit error rate (BER) performance and a higher bandwidth efficiency than the previous training based I/Q imbalance compensation method, but also outperform the ideal case with perfect channel state information (CSI) and no I/Q imbalance, due to additional frequency diversity.	ambiguity function;bit error rate;channel state information;digital signal processor;embedded system;frequency divider;goodyear mpp;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;interpolation;mimo;multiplexing;overhead (computing);semiconductor industry;simulation;spectral efficiency;x.690	Jingbo Gao;Xu Zhu;Hai Lin;Asoke K.

c6cebd00915c2331be193d465f5557abe4d8d7ff	protograph qc-ldpc codes design for multi-level cell flash memories		In this letter, protograph based quasi-cyclic (QC) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are designed for multi-level cell (MLC) NAND flash memories, where the exact voltage signal values are unavailable but rather the quantized voltage signals are measured for soft decoding. Existing LDPC codes optimized for symmetric, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)-like channels are not optimal for flash memory channels due to their asymmetries. The proposed approach exploits the mutual information (MI) between input and output of flash memory to model the quantized log-likelihood ratio (LLR) messages. The proposed protograph based codes, whose base matrix is constructed according to the degree sequences optimized by the modified extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart method for NAND flash memories, have a low-complexity QC encoder structure with a readily parallelizable protograph decoder structure. Moreover, a rate-compatible family of protograph LDPC codes can be conveniently generated according to the proposed nested photograph. Simulation results and theoretical analyses are provided to support the advantages of the proposed coding scheme.	additive white gaussian noise;degree (graph theory);exit chart;encoder;flash memory;input/output;low-density parity-check code;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;multi-level cell;mutual information;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Lingjun Kong;Jun Li;Pingping Chen;Shunwai Zhang	2017	2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170938	low-density parity-check code;computer science;real-time computing;information transfer;decoding methods;additive white gaussian noise;flash memory;multi-level cell;nand gate;communication channel;electronic engineering	EDA	41.974848178248756	66.43934985936717	132011

Existing industrial communication standards adopt the IEEE 802.15.4 specification, which provides no means to correct the detected errors. We propose an IEEE 802.15.4-compliant Forward Error Correction-based approach that can be easily retrofitted into the standard without the need for any kind of interaction with chip manufacturers or standardization bodies. We evaluate the approach on link- and network-level scenarios. Improvement of reliability by using FEC can yield multiple benefits: a reduced number of retransmissions, and lower average latency, to name a few. With respect to the uncoded system, the proposed solution provides identical coding gain as the traditional FEC method, at a significantly lower computational load of decoding.	block code;coding gain;coupling (computer programming);data integrity;design review (u.s. government);error detection and correction;experiment;forward error correction;interference (communication);mesh networking;network packet;point-to-point (telecommunications);qr code;run time (program lifecycle phase)	Kan Yu;Filip Barac;Mikael Gidlund;Johan Åkerberg;Mats Björkman	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/ISIE.2012.6237255	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;ieee 802.11h-2003;computer network	Embedded	44.71501504268908	66.7525235336785	132191

In the proposed scheme, relatively short-length, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are independently used to encode the bit sequences of each source. To reconstruct the original bit sequence, a joint source-channel decoding (JSCD) technique is proposed which exploits the knowledge of both temporal and source correlations. The JSCD technique is composed of two stages, which are iteratively performed. First, a sum-product (SP) decoder is serially concatenated with a BCJR decoder, where the knowledge of source memory is utilized during local (horizontal) iterations. Then, the estimate of correlation between the sources is used to update the concatenated decoder during global (vertical) iterations. Therefore, the correlation of the sources is assumed as side information in the subsequent global iteration of each concatenated decoder. From the simulation results of frame/bit error rate (FER/BER), we note that significant gains are achieved by the proposed decoding scheme with respect to the case where the correlation knowledge is not completely utilized at the decoder.	additive white gaussian noise;bcjr algorithm;bit error rate;concatenation;encode;eb/n0;iteration;low-density parity-check code;markov chain;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Reza Asvadi;Tadashi Matsumoto;Markku J.

An intensive performance analysis is provided in terms of the mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation, which provides a good match with the numerical results.

To solve this problem, we propose a look-ahead check technique that not only reduces the complexity of the LLL algorithm but also produces the lattice-reduced matrix which obeys the original LLL criterion. Simulation results show that the proposed LR-LLL algorithm reduces the average number of loops or computation complexity. Besides, it also shortens the latency of clock cycles about 19.4%, 29.1%, and 46.1% for 4× 4, 8× 8, and 12× 12 MIMO systems, respectively.		Chun-Fu Liao;Li-Wei Chai;Yuan-Hao Huang	2012	J.

By combining the characteristics of Poisson distribution (PD) and robust soliton distribution (RSD), PRSD can improve both the decoding efficiency and the symbol recovery probability. There are three important parameters λ, δ, and c in PRSD, which directly affect the encoding/decoding performance of LT codes. The appropriate value of λ is obtained according to the mathematical properties of PD and the average degree of the coded symbols.

We employ a Markov random field (MRF) graphical model of the system on which we carry out message passing. The proposed BP equalizer is shown to perform increasingly closer to optimal performance for increasing number of multipath components (MPC) at a much lesser complexity than that of the optimum equalizer. The proposed equalizer performs close to within 0.25 dB of SISO AWGN performance at 10^{-3} bit error rate on a severely delay-spread MIMO-ISI channel with 20 equal-energy MPCs. We point out that, although MIMO/UWB systems are characterized by fully/densely connected graphical models, the following two proposed features are instrumental in achieving near-optimal performance for large number of MPCs at low complexities: i) use of pairwise compatibility functions in densely connected MRFs, and ii) use of damping of messages.	additive white gaussian noise;belief propagation;bit error rate;equalization (communications);graphical model;information sciences institute;interference (communication);mimo;markov chain;markov random field;message passing;mike lesser;multipath propagation;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;software propagation;ultra-wideband;x.690	Pritam Som;Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5502031	telecommunications;adaptive equalizer;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;graphical model;statistics	Robotics	46.87082234374089	73.46893290059828	132992

Thus, the need for efficient error-correcting codes is increasing. Furthermore, since most mobile devices operate with limited battery power, low-power communication techniques are attracting considerable attention lately. In this article, we propose a novel low-power, low-density parity check (LDPC) decoder. The LDPC code is one of the most common error-correcting codes. In mobile TV, SNR estimation is required for the adaptive coding and modulation technique. We apply the SNR estimation result to the proposed LDPC decoding to minimize power consumption due to unnecessary operations. The SNR estimation value is used for predicting the iteration count until the completion of the successful LDPC decoding. When the SNR value is low, we omit computing the parity check and the tentative decision. We implemented the proposed decoder which is capable of adaptively skipping unnecessary operations based on the SNR estimation. The power consumption was measured to show the efficiency of our approach. We verified that, by using our proposed method, power consumption is reduced by 10% for the SNR range of 1.5-2.5 dB.	adaptive coding;forward error correction;iteration;kernel density estimation;low-density parity-check code;low-power broadcasting;mobile device;mobile television;modulation;parity bit;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput	Joo-Yul Park;Ki-Seok Chung	2011	EURASIP J.

Usually a reduction process includes not only permutations but also unimodular transformations. However, owing to the box-constraint, the current reduction strategies are limited to only permutations, which makes SD algorithm still very time-consuming. In this study a theoretical complexity analysis on SD algorithm is first proposed to show what kind of criteria a reduction process should pursue. Then a new reduction strategy which combines permutations with unimodular transformations is presented to obtain a better reduced detection problem. Simulation results showed that this new reduction strategy can make SD algorithm much more efficient than those reduction strategies with only permutations.

ST block codes are capable of realizing full diversity and spatial coding gains at relatively low rates; ST trellis codes can achieve better rate-diversity tradeoffs at the cost of high complexity. On the other hand, V-BLAST supports high rates but has no built-in spatial coding and does not work well with fewer receive than transmit antennas. We propose a novel linear block-coding scheme based on the Khatri-Rao matrix product. The proposed scheme offers flexibility for achieving full-rate or full-diversity, or a desired rate-diversity tradeoff, and it can handle any transmit/receive antenna configuration or signal constellation. The proposed codes are shown to have numerous desirable properties, including guaranteed unique linear decodability, built-in blind channel identifiability, and efficient near-maximum likelihood decoding.	blast;cs-blast;canonical account;convolutional code;data compression;decoding methods;matrix multiplication;trellis quantization	Nikos D.

As in single-antenna systems, the computation of the optimum receiver is an analytically intractable problem and is unimplementable in practice. In this purview, we propose three suboptimal, low-complexity algorithms for approximately implementing the MAP symbol detector, which involve joint phase noise estimation and data detection. Our first algorithm is obtained by means of the sum-product algorithm, where we use the multivariate Tikhonov canonical distribution approach. In our next algorithm, we derive an approximate MAP symbol detector based on the smoother-detector framework, wherein the detector is properly designed by incorporating the phase noise statistics from the smoother. The third algorithm is derived based on the variational Bayesian framework. By simulations, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms for both uncoded and coded data transmissions and observe that the proposed techniques significantly outperform the other important algorithms from prior works, which are considered herein.	approximation algorithm;belief propagation;computation;computational complexity theory;mimo;phase noise;quantum phase estimation algorithm;simulation;variational principle;wiener filter	Rajet Krishnan;Giulio Colavolpe;Alexandre Graell i Amat;Thomas Eriksson	2015	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2015.2420533	mathematical optimization;mathematics;phase noise;statistics;mimo	ML	47.394150969393586	73.96374787820312	133609

This problem arises when N>M or when the channel gains are strongly correlated. The upper triangular factorization of the Grammian yields an under-determined system and the standard sphere decoding (SD) fails. For constant modulus constellations, we modify the maximum likelihood (ML) cost metric so that the equivalent Grammian is rank N. The resulting GSD algorithm has significantly lower complexity than previous algorithms. A method to handle nonconstant modulus constellations is also developed.

These vectors are typically estimated at the receiver, quantized, and fed-back to the transmitter via a low-rate feedback channel. We present a method for designing an efficient low-rate quantizer for the dominant right singular vectors of a MIMO channel matrix, which exploits the memory in the slow-varying channel fading process. A memory-based (recursive) quantizer is considered which quantizes the time-trajectory of points representing the channel subs-spaces on a Grassmannian manifold. The quantizer codebook is optimized with respect to an objective functions which can be directly related to MIMO channel capacity. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of a stochastic gradient-based algorithm for codebook optimization. Numerical results obtained with channel simulations are presented, which demonstrate the MIMO channel capacity improvement achieved by using the codebooks optimized as proposed in this paper.	algorithm;channel capacity;codebook;mimo;mathematical optimization;numerical method;recursion;simulation;transmitter	Pradeepa Yahampath;Are Hjørungnes	2010	2010 IEEE Wireless Communication and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2010.5506747	stochastic process;algorithm design;transmitter;quantization;doppler effect;channel code;manifold;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;feedback;mathematics;fading;precoding;channel capacity;communications system;statistics;mimo	EDA	40.169302496999755	72.64119131631674	133735

Str-AMP consists of two steps in each iteration. First, a decoupling operation is performed in the same way as AMP. Then, at the denoising step, to exploit the structured sparsity of SM signals, Str-AMP computes each element of SM signals using not only its own statistics but also those of its neighboring elements belonging to the same user. Since Str-AMP maintains scalar message passing, it is computationally efficient. Simulation results on various settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Str-AMP in terms of both uncoded and coded bit error rate performance.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;bit error rate;c++ amp;coupling (computer programming);iteration;message passing;modulation;multi-user;noise reduction;operational amplifier;simulation;sparse matrix;x.690	Xiangming Meng;Sheng Wu;Linling Kuang;Defeng Huang;Jianhua Lu	2016	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2577627	message passing;real-time computing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;noise reduction;distributed computing;modulation	ML	46.567711194592675	74.07850453152093	134118

To exploit the diversity advantage of Alamouti's STBC, the optimization of STBC-CSM is given by maximizing its coding gain. Moreover, the proposed scheme allows for a low-complexity maximum-likelihood (ML) detector due to the orthogonality of Alamouti's STBC.

A dual-mode carrier recovery (DCR) circuit is proposed that adaptively selects one of two phase locked-loop operation modes: the conventional mode or the adaptive carrier-tracking (ACT) mode. The ACT mode digitally controls the reference phase, and enables instantaneous phase tracking in burst signal operation and/or in a fast fading environment. The DCR coherent demodulator performance is identical to that of conventional coherent detection in the low-CNR region, and to that of differential detection in the high CNR region where the ACT mode is selected. >		Shigeki Saito;Hiroshi Suzuki	1989	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.16854	carrier signal;embedded system;phase-locked loop;digital control;telecommunications;carrier recovery;detection theory	Mobile	51.585316524235765	69.8195473445378	134203

Moreover, protograph SC-LDPC codes have been shown to be asymptotically good under certain conditions. SC-LDPC codes are amenable to a windowed decoder that allows decoding of blocks of bits to be done serially, making them good candidates for applications such as streaming. Depending on how they are constructed, however, the codes may still be prone to error floors. One key element in protograph SC-LDPC code design is the edge-spreading method used to couple copies of the base protograph in the construction of the SC-protograph. In this paper, we present an edge-spreading algorithm that is designed to remove trapping sets from the resulting SC-protograph that are harmful with respect to the windowed decoder, and we examine how to determine which trapping sets should be removed in the construction.	algorithm;error floor;low-density parity-check code;sparse graph code;sparse matrix;streaming media;window function	Allison Beemer;Christine A.

Recent work on TPC/SPC codes has focused on ideal partial response channels with additive white Gaussian noise. This work extends the investigation to a more realistic equalized Lorentzian channel model where imperfect channel shaping, colored noise and recording density effect are taken into consideration. The effect of precoding is discussed and the interleaving gain is quantified. Simulation results of the turbo decoding system with both channel models are presented. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted, including BER performance, code rate selection, equalization targets and error statistics, which demonstrate TPC/SPC codes to be a promising candidate for future high-density recording systems.	additive white gaussian noise;channel (communications);code rate;colors of noise;forward error correction;ibm tivoli storage productivity center;low-density parity-check code;noise shaping;parity bit;simulation;turbo code;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Jing Li;Erozan M.

Under a factor graph framework, the proposed algorithm first constructs a graphical model for the mobile position location problem by dividing the problem into many mutually-interactive local constraints. Each local constraint is enforced by a separate local processing unit. Efficient exchange of soft-information among local processing units in the mobile switching center (MSC) then iteratively purifies the estimate of the MS location. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm not only enjoys low complexity, suitable for integrated-circuit implementation, but it is also able to achieve performance very close to the optimum achievable solution accuracy, the maximum likelihood (ML) solution accuracy	algorithm;computational complexity theory;factor graph;geolocation;graphical model;integrated circuit;mean squared error;numerical method;simulation;telephone exchange;time of arrival	Jung-Chieh Chen;Yeong-Cheng Wang;Ching-Shyang Maa;Jiunn-Tsair Chen	2006	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2006.03401	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;graph theory;time of arrival;factor graph;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Mobile	53.644959356642424	74.18545803364812	134332

Previously, EXIT functions derived for binary erasure channels (BECs) were used as an approximation for other channels. Here, we improve on this approach by introducing more accurate methods to construct EXIT functions for binary-input memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels. By defining an alternative pseudo-MAP decoder coinciding with the MAP decoder over BEC, we provide an expression for the EXIT functions of block codes over BEC. Furthermore, we draw a connection between the EXIT function over BEC and the EXIT function over the BMS channel under certain conditions. This is used for deriving accurate or approximate expressions of EXIT functions over BMS channels in certain scenarios	approximation algorithm;battery eliminator circuit;battery management system;binary erasure channel;bit error rate;block code;bridge management system;code word;hamming code;input/output;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;mutual information;parity bit;repetition code;turbo code	Eran Sharon;Alexei E.

Past research has shown that LT codes can perform well for a large number of input symbols. However, mathematical analysis and simulation results have revealed that the packet overhead for LT decoders can be as large as 100% when the number of input symbols is small. Designing an efficient decoder to handle a small number of symbols becomes an imminent research issue. In this paper, we make an observation that LT decoders often fail to recover all the input symbols, while LT encoders have a high probability of producing a full-rank coefficient matrix. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel decoding algorithm called LT-W, in which we incorporate the use of the Wiedemann solver into LT decoding to extend the decodability of LT codes. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method reduces the packet overhead significantly and yet preserves the efficiency of the original LT decoding process.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;binary erasure channel;coefficient;computation;doping (semiconductor);encoder;experiment;luby transform code;michael luby;network packet;overhead (computing);ripple effect;simulation;solver	Haifeng Lu;Feng Lu;Jianfei Cai;Chuan Heng Foh	2013	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2013.2283500	discrete mathematics;transform coding;channel code;theoretical computer science;luby transform code;mathematics;raptor code;algorithm;statistics	Vision	40.565950182725096	62.39844751181784	134673

It makes use of two sets of orthogonal signal waveforms, one for the first N users and one for the additional users. An iterative multistage detection technique is used to cancel interference between the two sets of users. At each stage of the detection process, the best estimate of the multiuser interference is synthesized using the decisions available from the previous stages, and this interference is subtracted from the user signals of interest before entering them to a threshold detector. The new concept is described using orthogonal code-division multiple access and time division multiple access as the two sets of signal waveforms, but we also briefly outline how it can be generalized to other orthogonal sets.	bandwidth (signal processing);comparator applications;interference (communication);iterative method;multi-user;multistage amplifier;netware	Hikmet Sari;Frederik Vanhaverbeke;Marc Moeneclaey	2000	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/4234.823531	computer simulation;code division multiple access;single antenna interference cancellation;waveform;index term;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;sequence;spread spectrum;time division multiple access;channel capacity;telecommunications network;detection theory	Mobile	49.47131725314345	71.8046491985617	134718

It is shown that when the disturbing data signal has power P less than the power S of the useful signal (whose timing must be recovered), the jitter is sinusoidal with amplitude proportional to the ratio P/S.

In particular, the BICM combined with convolutional coding has been adopted by several recent standards due to its low complexity and low latency at the decoder side. The performance of the convolutionally coded BICM depends not only on the constraint length of the code but also significantly on the structure of the bit interleavers introduced mainly for the purpose of dispersing the correlated bits. To date, however, theoretical analysis of the performance that well captures its dependence on the interleaver structures has not been presented in conjunction with the convolutionally coded BICM due to its complexity in precise analysis. In this paper, we derive a tight approximate BER expression over AWGN channels to evaluate its performance for a given bit interleaver structure, and present a design guideline for an optimal interleaver structure with its performance over fading channels in mind.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;binary-coded decimal;bit error rate;convolutional code;forward error correction;mimo-ofdm;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;x.690	Yuta Hori;Hideki Ochiai	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248994	telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science	Robotics	42.4818386266876	70.72517440870998	135184

The lower bounds on the density of arbitrary parity-check matrices are expressed in terms of the gap between the rate of these codes for which reliable communication is achievable and the channel capacity, and the bounds are valid for every sequence of binary linear block codes. These bounds address the question, previously considered by Sason and Urbanke, of how sparse can parity-check matrices of binary linear block codes be as a function of the gap to capacity. Similarly to a previously reported bound by Sason and Urbanke, the new lower bounds on the parity-check density scale like the log of the inverse of the gap to capacity, but their tightness is improved (except for a binary symmetric/erasure channel, where they coincide with the previous bound). The new upper bounds on the achievable rates of binary linear block codes tighten previously reported bounds by Burshtein et al., and therefore enable to obtain tighter upper bounds on the thresholds of sequences of binary linear block codes under ML decoding. The bounds are applied to lowdensity parity-check (LDPC) codes, and the improvement in their tightness is exempli ed numerically. The upper bounds on the achievable rates enable to assess the inherent loss in performance of various iterative decoding algorithms as compared to optimal ML decoding. The lower bounds on the asymptotic parity-check density are helpful in assessing the inherent tradeo between the asymptotic performance of LDPC codes and their decoding complexity (per iteration) under message-passing decoding.	algorithm;binary erasure channel;channel capacity;code (cryptography);decoding methods;input/output;iteration;linear code;low-density parity-check code;message passing;numerical analysis;parity bit;sparse matrix	Gil Wiechman;Igal Sason	2005	CoRR		block code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;theoretical computer science;linear code;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;error floor;statistics	Crypto	39.63864242660905	62.717418425431774	135225

The Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA) is considered as an initial step to obtain an intermediate result. The final decoding result is obtained by interpolating the output of the EEA at the least reliable positions of the received word. We refer to this decoding method as reduced list-decoding, since not all received positions are used in the interpolation as in other list-decoding methods, such as the Guruswami-Sudan and Wu algorithms. Consequently the complexity of the interpolation step is reduced considerably. The probability of failure can be minimised by adjusting certain parameters, making it comparable with the KötterVardy algorithm but having a much lower complexity.	code (cryptography);decision list;decoding methods;extended euclidean algorithm;folded reed–solomon code;interpolation;kinetic void;list decoding;yet another	Mostafa Hosni Mohamed;Johan Sebastian Rosenkilde Nielsen;Martin Bossert	2014	CoRR		extended euclidean algorithm;interpolation;mathematical optimization;mathematics;discrete mathematics;list decoding;decoding methods;reed–solomon error correction	Theory	42.89154580982056	60.951481080117546	135547

For SC-FDE, cyclic prefix is employed to facilitate frequency-domain equalization at the receiver. Since inserting cyclic prefix incurs a loss in bandwidth-utilization efficiency, it is desirable to limit the length of cyclic prefix for SC-FDE. This paper designs the energy spreading transform (EST), a precoder that enables iterative reconstruction of missing cyclic prefix. The performance of the proposed scheme is shown to be close to that of SC-FDE with enough length of cyclic prefix.

Nonline-of-sight (NLOS) propagation error is the dominant error source in mobile positioning. Most previous research in this area has focused on NLOS identification and mitigation. In this paper, we investigate new positioning algorithms to take advantage of the NLOS propagation paths rather than canceling them. Based on a prior information about the NLOS path, a geometrical approach is proposed to estimate mobile location by using two NLOS paths. On top of this, the least-squares (LS)-based position estimation algorithm is developed to take multiple NLOS paths into account, and its performance in terms of root mean-square error (RMSE) is analyzed. A general LS algorithm considering both LOS and NLOS paths is also derived, and the maximum likelihood-based algorithm is presented to jointly estimate the mobile's and scatterers' positions. The Cramer-Rao lower bound on the RMSE is derived for the benchmark of the performance comparison. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated analytically and is done via computer simulations. Numerical results demonstrate that the derived analytical results closely match the simulated results.		Honglei Miao;Kegen Yu;Markku J. Juntti	2007	IEEE Trans.

We consider an image compression system with an OFB based signal decomposition followed by scalar quantization and a redundant entropy coding scheme. This encoding chain can be viewed as a concatenation of an OFB code and an error correcting entropy code. The error correcting ability of an OFB comes from the explicit redundancy introduced into the transmitted signal by oversampling while the error correcting ability of the entropy code comes from the implicit redundancy due to the Markov property of the OFB outputs. The decoder consists of the soft-input soft-output entropy decoder and a syndrome decoder for the OFB code. The soft information at the output of the entropy decoder is utilized in the error localization procedure of the OFB syndrome decoder. The performance of the algorithm is examined for an image coding system with a wavelet filter bank.	algorithm;binary decoder;channel capacity;codec;concatenation;decoding methods;entropy encoding;filter bank;forward error correction;global communications conference;image compression;impulse noise (audio);joint source and channel coding;markov chain;markov property;oversampling;quantization (signal processing);soft-in soft-out decoder;vlc media player;wavelet	Slavica Marinkovic;Christine Guillemot	2004	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2004.

We consider a wireless sensor network with both wireless link impairments and node failures. We analyze two performance metrics of the proposed image transport scheme: energy consumption and received image quality distortion. Our analysis models key aspects of the network including forward error correction, path diversity, and the multi-hop nature of ad-hoc networks. The channel model used is a two-state Markov model describing errors on the bit level. We also use a two-state Markov model of node transitions between an “on” and “off” state. Reed-Solomon coding is used for forward error correction. Theoretical and simulation results show the robustness improvement. This work also helps in understanding the tradeoffs between image quality distortion and energy consumption as a function of various network parameters such as the number of hops between the source and the destination, the average channel error rate, and the average node failure rate.	algorithm;bit-level parallelism;channel (communications);coefficient;cognitive dimensions of notations;communications protocol;distortion;entropy encoding;error detection and correction;failure rate;forward error correction;hoc (programming language);image quality;markov chain;markov model;reed–solomon error correction;sensor web;simulation;wavelet transform	Huaming Wu;Alhussein A.

Impulsive noise arises in many modern wireless and wireline communication systems, such as Wi-Fi and powerline communications, due to uncoordinated interference that is much stronger than thermal noise. We first show that the bit-error-rate optimal receiver jointly estimates the propagation channel coefficients, the noise impulses, the finite-alphabet symbols, and the unknown bits. We then propose a near-optimal yet computationally tractable approach to this joint estimation problem using loopy belief propagation. In particular, we merge the recently proposed “generalized approximate message passing” (GAMP) algorithm with the forward-backward algorithm and soft-input soft-output decoding using a “turbo” approach. Numerical results indicate that the proposed receiver drastically outperforms existing receivers under impulsive noise and comes within 1 dB of the matched-filter bound. Meanwhile, with N tones, the proposed factor-graph-based receiver has only O(NlogN) complexity, and it can be parallelized.	approximation algorithm;belief propagation;bit error rate;casio loopy;channel state information;cobham's thesis;coefficient;decibel;estimation theory;factor graph;forward–backward algorithm;frequency divider;interference (communication);johnson–nyquist noise;matched filter;message passing;multiplexing;parallel computing;software propagation	Marcel Nassar;Philip Schniter;Brian L.

Because of the pulsed or duty-cycled nature of the ultra-short transmitted waveforms, timing synchronization and channel estimation pose major, and often conflicting, challenges and requirements. In order to address (or in fact bypass) both tasks, we design and test noncoherent UWB (de)modulation schemes, which remain operational even without timing and channel information. Relying on integrate-and-dump operations of what we term """"dirty templates,"""" we first derive a maximum likelihood (ML) optimal noncoherent UWB demodulator. We further establish a conditional ML demodulator with lower complexity. Analysis and simulations show that both can also be applied after (possibly imperfect) timing acquisition. Under the assumption of perfect timing, our noncoherent UWB scheme reduces to a differential UWB system. Our approach can also be adapted to a transmitted reference (TR) UWB system. We show that the resultant robust-to-timing TR (RTTR) approach considerably improves performance of the original TR system in the presence of timing offsets or residual timing acquisition errors"""	algorithm;autocorrelation;channel state information;coherence (physics);convex function;cross-correlation;legacy system;low-power broadcasting;requirement;resultant;semiconductor industry;simulation;social inequality;transistor;transponder timing;ultra-wideband;x.690	Liuqing Yang;Georgios B.

We introduce a family of signature-sequence sets that consists of a hierarchy of orthogonal subsets (HOS), and show that various signature-sequence sets designed for channel overloading belong to this family. Assuming an equal average energy (EAE) constraint on the user signals, an expression for the sum capacity of the HOS family is derived. We point out that the maximum sum capacity over the HOS family is achieved by the multiple-orthogonal (m-O) CDMA sequence sets. The sum capacity of m-O is only slightly less than the upper bound imposed by the Gaussian multiple-access channel. Moreover, m-O is superior to a system with N orthogonal sequences and (K-N) pseudonoise (PN) sequences (PN/O), which, in turn, outperforms a system with K PN sequences. Both for PN/O and sequence sets over HOS, there is no additional loss in sum capacity if we require the sequences to consist of chips that are binary or quaternary valued.	pseudorandom noise;pseudorandom number generator	Frederik Vanhaverbeke;Marc Moeneclaey	2005	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2004.841998	chip;code division multiple access;electronic engineering;index term;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;pseudorandom noise;upper and lower bounds;algorithm;code generation;mean;detection theory;set theory	Theory	42.381110898758195	73.4562703998194	136722

The architecture consists of the desired number of processing elements (PE) connected by the suggested MINs, thus allowing a tradeoff between complexity and speed. The structure of the MIN is derived first by transforming the de Bruijn interconnection-based Viterbi algorithm trellis into the equivalent trellis with a perfect shuffle interconnection, and then applying a new decomposition of the perfect shuffle operator. This results in an efficient modular system and data flow is formed by the shuffling in a local PE memory and data exchange through a fixed interconnection between PEs. We suggest several solutions for 1/n and k/n rate codes, where k denotes the number of input bits shifting into k shift registers of the encoder and, at each cycle, the encoder produces n output bits as linear combinations of certain bits in the shift registers.	multistage interconnection networks;viterbi algorithm	David Akopian;Jarmo Takala;Jukka Saarinen;Jaakko Astola	2003	IEEE Trans.

In such a scheme, the complexity of the optimal soft-input soft-output (SISO) equalizer, which implements the BCJR a posteriori probability computation algorithm, is one of the major concerns. We extend the reduced state sequence detection (RSSD) algorithm to a BCJR-SISO equalizer matched to a non binary modulation. The resulting reduced-state SISO (RS-SISO) algorithms can take full advantage from the flexibility offered by RSSD in reducing the number of trellis states. However, extension of RSSD algorithm for obtaining the RS-SISO equalizers requires attention in the recombination procedure of the forward and backward metrics.	bcjr algorithm;computation;delta-sigma modulation;equalization (communications);interference (communication);iteration;recursion;reed–solomon error correction;sensor;simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder;trellis quantization;turbo code;turbo equalizer	Maurizio Magarini;Luca Reggiani;Arnaldo Spalvieri	2004	2004 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (IEEE Cat.

In our previous work, we proposed an Early Stopping (ES) strategy for a turbo HARQ scheme, which results in a beneficial complexity reduction, while maintaining a high throughput. However, this scheme was designed to strike a compromise across the full range of channel conditions. As a further advance, in this paper, we propose a new Deferred Iterations (DI) strategy, which is specifically designed for taking into account the prevalent channel conditions, as characterized by the Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart tunnel opening. More specifically, the DI strategy delays the commencement of turbo decoding until an open EXIT chart tunnel appears. Our simulation results demonstrate that the complexity of the proposed DI aided turbo HARQ schemes is reduced by up to 50%, which is achieved without compromising the Packet Loss Ratio (PLR) or throughput.	carpal tunnel syndrome;deferred shading;exit chart;early stopping;elegant degradation;hybrid automatic repeat request;iteration;public lending right;reduction (complexity);simulation;throughput;turbo code	Hong Chen;Robert G.

The paper differs from the classical ones in the sense that time-diwrete algorithms suitable for fully digital receivers are discussed. Sufficient conditions are given such that the signal samples represent sufficient statistics. These conditions involve signal bandwidth, samplingkymbol rate and the analog prefilter characteristics. It is shown that the sampling rate need not be an exact multiple of the symbol rate, i.e., the samples can be taken from a freerunning oscillator. All subsequent signal processing operations in the receiver then operate with the clock of this free-running oscillator. Timing recovery is then performed by a time-variant linear digital interpolator and a decimator. Carrier recovery and sequence estimation are performed at an average rate of one symbol per sample. The digital matched filter for this case is derived for an arbitrary colored noise spectrum.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);carrier recovery;colors of noise;electronic oscillator;matched filter;modulation;sampling (signal processing);signal processing	Heinrich Meyr;Martin Oerder;Andreas Polydoros	1994	IEEE Trans.

d15055dfb589226ac86d61a95cf353e1198e503a	wireless broadband single-carrier systems with mmse turbo equalization receivers		Broadband single-carrier modulated signals experience severe multipath distortion when propagating through the physical medium. Correcting the distortion with channel equalization is the foremost task of the detector. Prior information about the transmitted signals in the form of channel decoder feedback can significantly enhance equalization accuracy. An algorithm that iteratively performs channel decoding and equalization with prior information is generally denoted a turbo equalizer. This thesis focuses on turbo equalization with prior information using the principle of interference cancellation followed by minimum mean squared error (MMSE) filtering. Receiver algorithms, receiver convergence, and coding and modulation in the context of MMSE turbo equalization are studied. Computationally efficient versions of the receiver algorithm through approximate time-average filtering, matched filtering, square-root time-variant filtering and frequency-domain filtering are studied. The frequency-domain turbo equalizer (FDTE) is found to exhibit both superior convergence and low computational complexity among the compared equalizer algorithms. Multi-dimensional extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts are introduced for the purpose of tracking the convergence of the turbo equalization of layered MIMO transmissions. Generic properties of the equalizer EXIT functions defining the equalizer convergence are analyzed. The principles for detector ordering, maximum sum-rate code design and maximum rate symmetric design are derived from the properties of the multidimensional EXIT functions. Semi-analytical EXIT charts are developed for the convergence analysis of the FDTE. The effects of channel parameters and the channel code are analyzed with semi-analytical methods. A new approach for the design of irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes using a convergence outage principle is proposed. A performance gain is demonstrated in a single-input multiple output (SIMO) channel over non-optimized regular LDPC codes and irregular LDPC codes optimized for the AWGN channel. The outage convergence based design, which takes advantage of the semianalytical convergence analysis method, is also extended to layered MIMO transmissions. Quadrature amplitude modulation using multilevel bit-interleaved coded modulation (MLBICM) is studied as an alternative to regular bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) for highly bandwidthefficient transmission in MMSE turbo equalized systems. A linear bit-to-symbol mapping is introduced that enables the use of a computationally efficient MMSE turbo equalizer at the receiver. The proposed coded modulation is compared with BICM in channel measurement data based simulations and found to exhibit superior robustness against changes in spatial channel parameters. An automatic repeat request (ARQ) configuration using one ARQ controller for each equally performing group of code levels is proposed. The configuration takes advantage of the unequal error protection (UEP) property of the coded modulation. The semi-analytical convergence analysis is extended to the multilevel modulated case and applied in a channel measurement based convergence evaluation. The construction of the MLBICM is found to have an inherently better convergence behavior than BICM. Finally, the outage convergence based channel code design is extended to the layered MIMO multilevel signalling case.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;automatic repeat request;channel capacity;coding theory;computational complexity theory;delta-sigma modulation;distortion;exit chart;equalization (communications);foremost;interference (communication);low-density parity-check code;mimo;mean squared error;neural coding;semiconductor industry;simulation;sun outage;texture filtering;turbo equalizer	Kimmo Kansanen	2005			low-density parity-check code;mimo;turbo equalizer;modulation;control theory;information transfer;quadrature amplitude modulation;decoding methods;computer science;communication channel	Networks	46.29177446345436	74.01498518613457	138213

This scheme uses the reliability-output Viterbi algorithm (ROVA) to determine when the receiver's decoding estimate satisfies a given error constraint. We evaluate the performance of both terminated and tail-biting convolutional codes at average blocklengths less than 300 symbols, using the ROVA and the tail-biting ROVA, respectively. Comparing with recent results from finite-blocklength information theory, simulations for both the BSC and the AWGN channel show that the reliability-based decision-feedback scheme can surpass the random-coding lower bound on throughput for feedback codes at some blocklengths less than 100 symbols. This is true both when decoding after every symbol is permitted and when decoding is limited to a small number of increments. Finally, the performance of the reliability-based stopping rule with the ROVA is compared with retransmission decisions based on CRCs. For short blocklengths where the latency overhead of the CRC bits is severe, the ROVA-based approach delivers superior rates.	additive white gaussian noise;binary symmetric channel;convolutional code;cyclic redundancy check;feedback;information theory;overhead (computing);retransmission (data networks);simulation;throughput;viterbi algorithm	Adam R.

This approach generalizes practical cross-spectrum symbol-rate detectors, and derives a necessary condition which achieves the maximum processed signal-to-noise ratio at an integer multiple of the symbol rate. The resultant optimum condition depends on the transfer functions of precorrelation filters and fixed signal model parameters. As a by-product, the performance measure applicable to any quadrature amplitude modulation format is derived, including the effects of self-noise and intersymbol interference. An algorithm for constructing physically realizable precorrelation filters that satisfy the optimum condition is given to complete the design process.	algorithm;digital filter;interference (communication);modulation;optimal design;resultant;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;transfer function;utility functions on indivisible goods	Seok Ho Kim;Robert A.

For this purpose, we design two non-uniform quantizers, a high-rate- and a Lloyd-Max-quantizer, that are both based on the (golden angle) spiral-phyllotaxis packing principle. We find that the proposed schemes have lower mean-square error distortion compared to (non)-uniform polar/rectangular-quantizers, and near-identical to the best performing trained vector quantizers.

Unfortunately, due to the PN, the most valuable feature namely orthogonality between the carriers, is destroyed resulting in a significant degradation in the performance of OFDM systems. In this paper, based on a sequential Monte Carlo method (particle filtering), a computationally efficient algorithm is presented for estimating the residual phase noise, blindly, generated at the output of the phase tracking loop employed in OFDM systems. The basic idea is to treat the transmitted symbols as ‘missing data’ and draw samples sequentially of them based on the observed signal samples up to time t. This way, the Bayesian estimates of the phase noise is obtained through these samples, sequentially drawn, together with their importance weights. The proposed receiver structure is seen to be ideally suited for highspeed parallel implementation using VLSI technology. The performance of the proposed approaches are studied in terms of average mean square error. Through experimental results, the effects of an initialisation on the tracking performance are also explored.

Exploiting the GNSS signal model structure and the spreading code periodicity, we develop an efficient implementation of the Newton iterative likelihood maximization method by finding simple analytical expressions for the first and second derivatives of the likelihood function. The proposed fast iterative ML algorithm (FIMLA) for timedelay estimation, which uses the correlation function of the received signal with its local replica, is shown to be an attractive technique for mitigation of closely-spaced multipath arrivals. For the future modernized GPS and the European Galileo signals based on binary offset carrier (BOC) waveforms, the correlation function has multiple positive and negative peaks leading to potential tracking ambiguities. Instead of the standard crosscorrelation, we propose an implementation characterized by a different choice of the local replica so as to cancel the sub-carrier phase, thus eliminating ambiguities. The asymptotic performance of FIMLA is analyzed by deriving the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). Representative simulation examples are included to illustrate the FIMLA is performance for delay estimations in the presence of multipath for both C/A code and BOC signals.	cross-correlation;expectation–maximization algorithm;gps block iiia;galileo (satellite navigation);global positioning system;iterative method;multipath mitigation;multipath propagation;newton;quasiperiodicity;satellite navigation;simulation;subcarrier	Mohamed Sahmoudi;Moeness G.

The three well-known bounds, namely, th e sphere bound (SB) of Herzberg and Poltyrev, the tangential bound (TB) of Berlekamp, and the ta ngential-sphere bound (TSB) of Poltyrev, are generalized to general codes without the properties of g e metrical uniformity and equal energy. When applied to the binary linear codes, the three generaliz d bounds are reduced to the conventional ones.

A subset of the interleaved bits output by a binary LDPC encoder are passed through a nonlinear shaping encoder whose output is more likely to be a zero than a one. The """"shaping"""" bits are used to select from among a plurality of subconstellations, while the unshaped bits are used to select the symbol within the subconstellation. Because the shaping bits are biased, symbols from lower-energy subconstellations are selected more frequently than those from higher-energy subconstellations. An iterative decoder shares information among the LDPC decoder, APSK demapper, and shaping decoder. Information rates are computed for a discrete set of APSK ring radii and shaping bit probabilities, and the optimal combination of these parameters is identified for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. With the assistance of extrinsic-information transfer (EXIT) charts, the degree distributions of the LDPC code are optimized for use with the shaped APSK constellation. Simulation results show that the combination of shaping, degree-distribution optimization, and iterative decoding can achieve a gain in excess of 1 dB in AWGN at a rate of 3 bits/symbol compared with a system that does not use shaping, uses an unoptimized code from the DVB-S2 standard, and does not iterate between decoder and demodulator."""	additive white gaussian noise;dvb-s2;degree distribution;exit chart;encoder;iteration;iterative method;key (cryptography);low-density parity-check code;mathematical optimization;modulation;noise shaping;nonlinear system;offset binary;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Matthew C.

In order to increase the system throughput, the parallelization of LFSR is usually needed. Previously, a technique named state-space transformation was presented to reduce the complexity of parallel LFSR architectures. Exhaustive searches are performed to find good transformation matrix candidates. This brief proposes a new technique for construction of the transformation matrix together with a more efficient searching algorithm. The realization results indicate that the proposed architecture outperforms the prior arts, improving the hardware efficiency by around 35% and the corresponding searching algorithm finds the desirable transformation matrix much faster.	bch code;cyclic redundancy check;encoder;linear-feedback shift register;parallel computing;search algorithm;state space;throughput;transformation matrix	Guanghui Hu;Jin Sha;Zhongfeng Wang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2016.2608921	electronic engineering;parallel computing;logic gate;computer science;theoretical computer science;approximation algorithm;algorithm	HPC	44.06421490358541	61.543959556541516	140777

A high error coding rate limits the correcting capability of the RLL bit error. Since iterative decoding does not include the estimation technique, it has the potential capability of solving the hard error bits within several iterations compared to an LDPC coded system. In this letter, we implement density evolution and the differential evolution approach to provide a performance evaluation of unequal error protection LDPC code to investigate the optimal LDPC code distribution for an RLL flipped system.	bit error rate;degree distribution;differential evolution;error detection and correction;global optimization;iteration;low-density parity-check code;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;run-length encoding;x.690	Hong-Fu Chou;Chiu-Wing Sham	2018	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2863363	differential evolution;low-density parity-check code;real-time computing;probability density function;decoding methods;computer science;code rate	Visualization	41.88263172859655	64.09706491545852	141027

We first propose a technique to obtain transmit diversity for a single user over quasi-static fading channels by combining algebraic constellations with full spatial diversity and spreading sequences with good cross-correlation properties. The proposed scheme is then generalized to a multiuser system using the same algebraic constellation and different spreading sequences. We also propose a linear multiuser detector based on the combination of linear decorrelation with respect to all users, and the application of the sphere decoder to decode each user separately. Finally, we consider the generalization to multipath fading channels where the additional diversity advantage due to multipath is exploited by the sphere decoder, and a method of blind channel estimation based on subspace decomposition is examined.	channel state information;code;coding gain;cross-correlation;decorrelation;linear algebra;multi-user;multipath propagation;transmitter	Mohamed Oussama Damen;Anahid Safavi;Karim Abed-Meraim	2003	IEEE Trans.

However, this algorithm, even in its recursive form, poses technical diiculties because of numerical representation problems, the necessity of non-linear functions and a high number of additions and multiplications. MAP like algorithms operating in the logarithmic domain presented in the past solve the numerical problem and reduce the computational complexity, but are suboptimal especially at low SNR (a common example is the Max-Log-MAP because of its use of the max function). A further simpliication yields the soft-output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA). In this paper, we present a Log-MAP algorithm that avoids the approximations in the Max-Log-MAP algorithm and hence is equivalent to the true MAP, but without its major disadvantages. We compare the (Log-)MAP, Max-Log-MAP and SOVA from a theoretical point of view to illuminate their commonalities and diierences. As a practical example forming the basis for simulations, we consider Turbo decoding, where recursive systematic convolutional component codes are decoded with the three algorithms, and we also demonstrate the practical suitability of the Log-MAP by including quantization eeects. The SOVA is, at 10 ?4 , approximately 0.7 dB inferior to the (Log-)MAP, the Max-Log-MAP lying roughly in between. The channel capacities of the three algorithms-when employed in a Turbo decoder-are evaluated numerically. We also present some complexity comparisons and conclude that the three algorithms increase in complexity as they get closer to optimality.	approximation;code;computation;computational complexity theory;linear function;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;recursion;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;soft output viterbi algorithm	Patrick Robertson;Peter Adam Hoeher;Emmanuelle Villebrun	1997	European Transactions on Telecommunications	10.1002/ett.4460080202	combinatorics;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;markov process;algorithm;statistics	ML	45.34019023629303	70.41511215842498	141535

By exploiting the shift-routing network (SRN) features, the decoding messages are routed in parallel to fully support those specific 19 and 3 submatrix sizes defined in IEEE 802.16e and IEEE 802.11n applications with less hardware complexity. A 6.22- mm2 QC-LDPC decoder with SRN is implemented in a 90-nm 1-Poly 9-Metal (1P9M) CMOS process. Postlayout simulation results show that the operation frequency can achieve 300 MHz, which is sufficient to process the 212-Mb/s 2304-bit and 178-Mb/s 1944-bit codeword streams for IEEE 802.16e and IEEE 802.11n systems, respectively.	cmos;code word;low-density parity-check code;message passing;recurrent neural network;routing;simulation	Chih-Hao Liu;Chien-Ching Lin;Shao-Wei Yen;Chih-Lung Chen;Hsie-Chia Chang;Chen-Yi Lee;Yar-Sun Hsu;Shyh-Jye Jou	2009	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2009.2027967	ieee 802.11g-2003;parallel computing;real-time computing;low-density parity-check code;ieee 802.11b-1999;computer science;theoretical computer science;ieee 802.11h-2003	Visualization	45.43231137831813	62.3085068071015	141734

Both successive and parallel demodulation of users are considered. The filters are optimized according to the minimum mean-squared error criteria, assuming perfect feedback. We first consider Viterbi decoding with hard decision feedback, and compute union bounds on the large-system error rate. We then consider maximuma posteriori (MAP) decoding with soft decision feedback, and evaluate the error rate semianalytically by assuming the log-likelihood ratios computed by the MAP decoder are Gaussian random variables. Performance is studied numerically as a function of noise level, spectral efficiency, and code rate. Results show that soft decision feedback gives substantial gains relative to hard decision feedback. At moderate spectral efficiencies (users divided by bandwidth expansion less than 0.9), the iterative DFDs with soft decision feedback based ona posteriori probabilities can achieve near-single-user performance at an 0 close to the large-system capacity bound.	bandwidth expansion;channel capacity;code rate;feedback;iterative method;list of http status codes;mean squared error;multi-user;noise (electronics);numerical analysis;original net animation;sensor;spectral efficiency	Michael L.

In this paper, based on previous work reported in [1, 2], and using results from frame theory, we present a MIMO space-time code design which bridges the gap between multiplexing and diversity and performs well both in terms of ergodic capacity as well as error probability. In particular, we demonstrate that designs performing well from an ergodic capacity point of view do not necessarily perform well from an error probability point of view.

Previously published work on dynamic multiuser subcarrrier allocation for OFDMA systems with single-input-single-output (SISO) channels are surveyed. A near-optimal low-complexity algorithm for SISO systems, which is structurally similar to the algorithm by Rhee and Cioffi, is extended to the case of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems in this paper. The optimality and adaptability of this algorithm are analyzed by formulating an assignment problem and comparing with one optimal and two extended suboptimal strategies proposed based on previous work. Consideration of a MIMO channel creates further issues for the subcarrier-allocation process. In particular, methods whereby an appropriate subcarrier allocation may be exploited to minimize the effects of correlation in MIMO channels are of considerable interest. Several novel variants of the algorithm (referred to as ldquoschemesrdquo) are proposed and evaluated for MIMO systems employing both space-time block coding (STBC) and spatial multiplexing (SM) in both uncorrelated and correlated fading channels. Simulation results identify the most suitable schemes for both STBC and SM and, in particular, show that substantial improvements in performance (in terms of bit-error rate) in correlated channels can be achieved by means of suitable subcarrier allocation. In uncorrelated channels, the best scheme can offer approximately 7-dB gain over the conventional MIMO channel; in highly correlated channels, even more substantial improvements (>11-dB gain for STBC, >20-dB gain for SM) in performance can also be achieved, demonstrating the ability of a well-designed subcarrier-allocation scheme to mitigate the debilitating effects of correlation on MIMO systems.	assignment problem;bias–variance tradeoff;bit error rate;code;elegant degradation;emoticon;error floor;forward error correction;frequency allocation;goto;heuristic;mimo;modulation;multi-user;obedience (human behavior);pseudorandomness;rx microcontroller family;rocchio algorithm;shannon capacity of a graph;shannon–hartley theorem;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;sorting;spatial multiplexing;spatial variability;subcarrier	Ying Peng;Simon Armour;Joe McGeehan	2007	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2007.899951	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;control theory;mathematics	Embedded	45.19196853003033	72.43761803458477	142668

A precoding technique was recently introduced in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless communication systems to result in MAI-free codes, which simplifies the receiver design greatly. Being motivated by this work, we propose a new class of collusion-free codes called the OSIFT (orthogonal spreading followed by the inverse Fourier transform) codes. It is demonstrated by computer simulation that OSIFT codes have more robust performance against collusion attacks than existing collusion-free codes in an exemplary audio watermarking system.	code;computer simulation;frequency divider;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);multiplexing	Byung-Ho Cha;C.-C.

A main challenge in the quest for such receiver architecture has always been the computational/processing requirements. Even more demanding would be to try and incorporate the flexibility of the Software-Defined Radio (SDR) design philosophy in such an implementation. This paper documents a feasible approach to a real-time SDR implementation of a beam-steered GNSS receiver and validates its performance. This research implements a real-time software receiver on a widely-available x86-based multi-core microprocessor to process four-element antenna array data streams sampled with 16-bit resolution. The software receiver is capable of 12 channels all-in-view Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA) array processing capable of rejecting multiple interferers. Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions assembly coding and multithreaded programming, the key to such an implementation to reduce computational complexity, are fully documented within the paper. In conventional antenna array systems, receivers use the geometry of antennas and cable lengths known in advance. The documented CRPA implementation is architected to operate without extensive set-up and pre-calibration and leverages Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) to provide adaptation in both the frequency and space domains. The validation component of the paper demonstrates that the developed software receiver operates in real time with live Global Positioning System (GPS) and Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) L1 C/A code signal. Further, interference rejection capabilities of the implementation are also demonstrated using multiple synthetic interferers which are added to the live data stream.	16-bit;acclimatization;antenna device component;array processing;assembly language;calibration;computation;computational complexity theory;deny (action);document completion status - documented;etsi satellite digital radio;global positioning system;interference (communication);microprocessor;multi-core processor;numerous;real-time clock;real-time transcription;rejection sampling;requirement;simd;sampling - surgical action;satellite navigation;space-time adaptive processing;synthetic data;thread (computing);wide area augmentation system;x86;sensor (device)	Yu-Hsuan Chen;Jyh-Ching Juang;Jiwon Seo;Sherman C.

The novel subspace approach involves QR Decomposition (QRD) or Cholesky decomposition to triangularize the effective channel matrix so that several (possibly overlapping) groups of data streams can be detected separately. Link layer simulations show that the ergodic MIMO capacity can be closely approached by exploiting an Overlapped Subspace Detection (OSD) strategy. The OSD algorithm offers a scalable performance/complexity trade-off between Zero-Forcing (ZF) and Maximum a posteriori Probability (APP) detection. The proposed algorithm can be straightforwardly applied to large MIMO systems, as prevalent with recent advances in the field such as network MIMO and Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) transmission and reception.	algorithm;cholesky decomposition;computational complexity theory;ergodicity;mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;norm (social);object storage;qr decomposition;requirement;scalability;simulation;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Yejian Chen;Stephan ten Brink	2011	2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6139804	zero forcing equalizer;mathematical optimization;link layer;computer science;phase-shift keying;theoretical computer science;probability;communication complexity;mathematics;maximum likelihood;matrix decomposition;signal-to-noise ratio;cholesky decomposition;qr decomposition;statistics;mimo	Embedded	46.66640974116459	74.08652921611012	143044

The conventional maximum likelihood sequence estimator using the Viterbi algorithm has a time complexity of O(m/sup /spl nu/+1/) operations per symbol and a space complexity of O(/spl delta/m/sup /spl nu//) storage elements, where m is the size of input alphabet, /spl nu/ is the length of channel memory, and /spl delta/ is the truncation depth. By revising the truncation scheme and viewing the channel as a linear transform, the authors identify the problem of maximum likelihood sequence estimation with that of finding the nearest lattice point. From this lattice viewpoint, the lattice sequence estimator for PAM systems is developed, which has the following desired properties: 1) its expected time-complexity grows as /spl delta//sup 2/ as SNR/spl rarr//spl infin/; 2) its space complexity grow as /spl delta/; and 3) its error performance is effectively optimal for sufficiently large m. A tight upper bound on the symbol error probability of the new estimator is derived, and is confirmed by the simulation results of an example channel. It turns out that the estimator is effectively optimal for m/spl ges/4 and the loss in signal-to-noise ratio is less than 0.5 dB even for m=2. Finally, limitations of the proposed estimator are also discussed. >	maximum likelihood sequence estimation	Wai Ho Mow	1994	IEEE Trans.

The phase of interference is approximated by a polynomial within the considered interval. According to the local polynomial Fourier transform (LPFT) principle, the received signal is dechirped by using the obtained phase approximation and the interference is, in turn, suppressed by excising the corrupted low-pass frequency band. For the estimation of polynomial coefficients, we use the product high-order ambiguity function (PHAF), known for its capability to successfully resolve components of a multicomponent polynomial-phase signal (PPS). The proposed method can suppress interferences with both polynomial and non-polynomial phase. In addition, it can suppress both monocomponent and multicomponent interferences. The simulations show that the proposed method outperforms timefrequency (TF) methods, that successfully deal with multicomponent interferences, in terms of the error probability and computational complexity.	ambiguity function;approximation algorithm;coefficient;computational complexity theory;frequency band;interference (communication);low-pass filter;polynomial;simulation;stationary process;zero suppression	Slobodan Djukanovic;Vesna Popovic;Milos Dakovic;LJubisa Stankovic	2011	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2010.09.010	fourier transform;computer vision;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;calculus;signal processing;mathematics	Comp.	52.23596477938912	71.61300827200229	143279

The performance metric used is distortion SNR exponent which is defined as the rate of decay of mean-squared error (MSE) distortion with SNR. The optimal exponent is shown to be equal to the ratio of the number of channel uses to number of source samples. A superposition-based scheme is proposed that can achieve an exponent arbitrarily close to the optimal value.	additive white gaussian noise;distortion;mean squared error;optimization problem;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Kapil Bhattad;Krishna R.

It is generally acknowledged that differential encoding leads to a degradation in performance over absolutely encoded -PSK systems with perfect carrier synchronization. In this paper, we show that when differential encoding is combined with convolutional encoding and interleaving, this degradation does not necessarily occur. We propose a novel noncoherent receiver for differentially encoded -PSK signals that is capable of significantly outperforming optimal coherent receivers for absolutely encoded -PSK using the same convolutional code. This receiver uses an iterative decoding technique and is based on a multiple differential detector structure to overcome the effect of the carrier phase error. In addition, to better illustrate the benefits of the powerful combination of convolutional encoding, interleaving, and differential encoding, we also present an iterative coherent receiver for differentially encoded -PSK.	coherence (physics);convolutional code;elegant degradation;forward error correction;iteration;iterative method;key (cryptography);modulation;pre-shared key	Ian D.

This scheme allows flexible selection of space-time mappings, signal constellations, and outer codes used on each level of the mapping, for each antenna. We introduce the concept of the space-time distorted bit-level extrinsic information transfer (STDBL-EXIT) function, derive the area properties of the STDBL-EXIT functions in information theoretic terms, and show a highly-efficient code design rule for ST-MLCM-ID. Simulations further demonstrate that by employing our rule based on the STDBL-EXIT function, ST-MLCM-ID is capable of achieving full convergence close to the theoretical limit, while also allowing sufficient flexibility in the choice of codes on each level of the space-time mapping of each antenna.	modulation	Yi Wang;Alister G.

By iterating approximate versions of the HR algorithm, novel iterative probabilistic decoding algorithms for fast correlation attacks are developed. In particular, these algorithms can be applied when a large number of nonorthogonal parity checks are used. A number of properties of the proposed iterated versions of the HR algorithm including convergence conditions and critical bit error rates are derived.	approximation algorithm;bit error rate;correlation attack;hermann hartmann;iteration;iterative method;linear code;linear-feedback shift register;stream cipher	Jovan Dj.

However, when the link includes an avalanche photodetector (APD) receiver and is operating at a low BER, Monte Carlo simulation requires excessive execution time unless assumptions are made about the APD statistics. Techniques are presented that reduce the computational resources required to estimate the BER for these systems by two orders of magnitude. The speed-up is achieved by developing anew, more efficient random number generation algorithm for APD shot noise and by applying a tail extrapolation technique to the conditional distributions at the sample-and-decide input in the receiver. Receiver thermal noise is handled analytically. Accurate BER estimates for an NRZ direct-detection system are obtained in approximately 1.5 CPU hours on a VAXstation II using a combination of these techniques. >	lightwave 3d;simulation	J.

Firstly, we analyze mathematically how the optimal spherical cap radius of the proposed codebook is tracked. Then, we explain how to implement the proposed differential equal-gain codebook practically. Among the candidate differential codebooks designed for various temporal correlation coefficients, the proper codebook can be chosen (or switched) according to the temporal correlation coefficients of wireless channels. We assume that the correlation coefficients of the channels are known to the receiver and the properly (or optimally) chosen differential codebook can show the best system throughput performance. Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate that the achievable throughput performance employing the proposed codebook is always superior to those of the differential codebooks employing M-PSK constellations and non-adaptive differential codebooks with the same amount of feedback information.	code word;codebook;coefficient;entity;mimo;pre-shared key;simulation;throughput	Noe Yoon Park;Young Ju Kim;Xun Li	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666164	channel code;telecommunications;computer science;phase-shift keying;theoretical computer science;mathematics;linde–buzo–gray algorithm;statistics;monte carlo method	Mobile	40.399698281194475	72.11818599580465	144799

1026210139ca0b14977a77856eb135ed4cfb53f4	neural belief propagation decoding of crc-polar concatenated codes		Polar codes are the first class of error correcting codes that provably achieve the channel capacity at infinite code length. They were selected for use in the fifth generation of cellular mobile communications (5G). In practical scenarios such as 5G, a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is concatenated with polar codes to improve their finite length performance. This is mostly beneficial for sequential successive-cancellation list decoders. However, for parallel iterative belief propagation (BP) decoders, CRC is only used as an early stopping criterion with incremental error-correction performance improvement. In this paper, we first propose a CRC-polar BP (CPBP) decoder by exchanging the extrinsic information between the factor graph of the polar code and that of the CRC. We then propose a neural CPBP (NCPBP) algorithm which improves the CPBP decoder by introducing trainable normalizing weights on the concatenated factor graph. Our results on a 5G polar code of length 128 show that at the frame error rate of 10−5 and with a maximum of 30 iterations, the error-correction performance of CPBP and NCPBP are approximately 0.25 dB and 0.5 dB better than that of the conventional CRC-aided BP decoder, respectively, while introducing almost no latency overhead.	algorithm;belief propagation;channel capacity;code (cryptography);concatenated error correction code;concatenation;cyclic redundancy check;early stopping;error detection and correction;factor graph;fifth generation computer;first-class function;forward error correction;iteration;list decoding;mobile phone;multi-factor authentication;overhead (computing);polar code (coding theory);requirement;software propagation	Nghia Doan;Seyyed Ali Hashemi;Elie Ngomseu Mambou;Thibaud Tonnellier;Warren J.

The relay computes the network coded message sequence directly from the superimposed signal using an iterative belief propagation algorithm. We explore the symmetry and permutation-invariant properties of the decoder's soft information distribution and adopt a two-dimension extrinsic information transfer chart to analyze and optimize the coding scheme. Numerical results demonstrate that our developed scheme achieves near-capacity performance in Gaussian two-way relay channels.	algorithm;approximation;belief propagation;code;exit chart;iterative method;linear network coding;relay;software propagation	Lei Yang;Tao Yang;Jianping An	2015	2015 22nd International Conference on Telecommunications (ICT)	10.1109/ICT.2015.7124694	project commissioning;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;reliability;publishing;mutual information;encoding;statistics;computer network;research	HPC	42.044224111124024	67.71332980375804	145099

While a typical sum-code-based DPC scheme uses a constrained decoder as part of the encoding operation, such an approach fails in the case of LDPC codes since the constrained decoder based on a standard LDPC decoder tends to get stuck at highly suboptimal points in typical scenarios. We get around this difficulty via a simple code construction method based on bit-mapping or permutation. Examples included in this paper show that compared to standard communication schemes the proposed DPC scheme yields substantial savings in terms of the transmit energy required to attain desired error performance.	block code;channel capacity;deferred procedure call;encoder;interference (communication);linear code;low-density parity-check code	Kiran M.

Accurate estimation of soft information should be conditioned for excellent performance of the JIDD, but it usually requires an exponential order of complexity. They propose a method which improves the performance of soft interference cancellation minimum mean-squared error (SIC-MMSE) method by increasing the reliability of the soft information utilised for interference cancellation. The proposed method utilises a posteriori probabilities from the MIMO detector as well as a priori probabilities from the turbo decoder, and perform soft minimum mean-squared error filtering for symbol level detection. With this approach, soft information is fully fed into the symbol detection process, and thus the reliability of soft symbol is increased. In addition, they can separate out the bit-level soft estimation process by using a simple linear method. Simulation results show that the proposed method provides substantial complexity reduction, with a bit error rate performance comparable to the conventional SIC-MMSE methods.	iteration;mimo	Saleem Ahmed;Sooyoung Kim	2015	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2015.0225	single antenna interference cancellation;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;a priori probability;mathematics;statistics	Metrics	46.45964750460819	71.72808355500891	145607

To achieve this, additional overhead is needed for error correction. In this paper, we design a compressed error and erasure correcting scheme to decrease the additional overhead of error correction. This scheme reduces the computation overhead dramatically by employing an efficient algorithm to detect and delete linearly dependent received packets in the destination node. It also simplifies the hardware operations when the scheme reduces the received matrix Y to form Ek.Y / instead of E.Y / in the decoding process. If at most r original packets get combined in k packets of one batch, the payload of one packet can increase from M k to M O.r logq k/ for the application of compressed code, where M is the packet length. In particular, the decoding complexity of compressed code is O.rm/ operations in an extension field Fqm , which does not enhance the overall decoding complexity of the system. Finally, we also compare our scheme’s performance with existing works. The numerical results and analyses illustrate the security and performance of our scheme.

A method to remove cycles of length four (RmFC) in the Tanner graph has been proposed. However, the RmFC can not realize good decoding performance for BCH codes which have more than one error correcting capability. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes two methods. One is to use a parity check matrix of the echelon canonical form as the starting check matrix of RmFC. The other is to use a parity check matrix that is concatenation (ConC) of multiple parity check matrices. For BCH(31,11,11) code, SPA with ConC realizes Eb/N0 3.8 dB better than the original SPA, and 3.1 dB better than the SPA with only RmFC at bit error rate 10-5. The decoding complexity is 0.08 times of that of Chase-2 decoding.	algorithm;bch code;belief propagation;bit error rate;concatenation;decibel;eb/n0;electronic case filing system;parity bit;parity-check matrix;row echelon form;tanner graph;windows 3.1x	Haruo Ogiwara;Kyouhei Shimamura;Toshiyuki Shohon	2008	2008 5th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Related Topics	10.1093/ietfec/e91-a.10.2729	arithmetic;telecommunications;maxeksat;mathematics;bch code;berlekamp–welch algorithm;algorithm;statistics	Arch	42.841213034794016	61.24678484377282	146200

Based on the proposed SISO decoder and the dedicated hardware interleaver, a duo-binary circular turbo decoder is designed for the WiMAX standard using a 0.13 μm CMOS process, which can support 24.26 Mbps at 200MHz.	cmos;data rate units;dummy variable (statistics);forward error correction;soft-in soft-out decoder	Ji-Hoon Kim;In-Cheol Yong Park	2008	2008 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference		wimax;embedded system;binary code;turbo code;electronic engineering;real-time computing;soft-decision decoder;computer science;cmos;field-programmable gate array	EDA	45.14023171775613	62.793562925513065	146651

For reliable information recovery, in case all links except one happen to be simultaneously in deep fade, self-decodable complementary punctured convolution codes, inspired from Hybrid ARQ III, are used. When turbo-decoding is feasible at the mobile station, new complementary codes, using different interleavers followed by a common systematic recursive convolutional encoder, are proposed for an additional enhancement in performance. Experimental evaluation of the enhancement in performance provided by complementary coding is carried for both Gaussian and multipath Rayleigh fading channels. The proposed coding schemes can provide very significant gains. In some cases, gains around 4 dB can be achieved.	active set method;convolution;encode;encoder;forward error correction;hybrid automatic repeat request;multipath propagation;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;recursion (computer science);telecommunications link;turbo code	Moustapha Ould El Aoun;Mohamed Siala;Hatem Boujemaa	2009	VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073537	block code;turbo code;electronic engineering;convolutional code;telecommunications;computer science;base station;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;error floor	Vision	43.19166218173065	68.2135963324837	146725

Companding transform (CT) is a well-known method to reduce PAPR without restrictions on system parameters such as number of subcarriers, frame format and constellation type. Recently, a linear nonsymmetrical companding transform (LNST) that has better performance than logarithmic-based transforms such as mu-law companding was proposed. In this paper, a new linear companding transform (LCT) with more design flexibility than LNST is proposed. Computer simulations show that the proposed transform has a better PAPR reduction and bit error rate (BER) performance than LNST with better power spectral density (PSD).	audio power amplifier;bit error rate;companding;elegant degradation;linear canonical transformation;modulation;multiplexing;nonlinear system;power architecture platform reference;quantization (signal processing);requirement;simulation;spectral density;subcarrier;system requirements;x.690	Sulaiman A.

51b29ceaf5479a0e68903c00b44a97956e336e05	symmetric split-row ldpc decoders		LDPC codes are deployed in many modern wired and wireless communication systems. While fully-parallel LDPC decoders are very efficient, they typically suffer from routing complexity. The Split-Row method effectively reduces this complexity with a minor performance loss. This paper shows the importance of symmetry in Split-Row architectures and proves that the implementation of Split-Row decoders based on new proposed smart column-permuted versions of parity check matrices leads to a better error performance as well as a more efficient hardware. Moreover, in order to achieve optimized column-permuted parity check matrices, a heuristic approach is proposed. This method is then generalized to support QC-LDPC codes. Applied to IEEE 802.3an (10GBASE-T Ethernet) and IEEE 802.11n (Wi-Fi) LDPC decoders, the new technique improves the error performance, while leading to almost 3x speed-up in the synthesis compile time and about 10% reduction in the critical path.	algorithm;compile time;compiler;critical path method;heuristic;low-density parity-check code;parity bit;routing	Mohammad Shahrad;Mahdi Shabany	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2017.8050909	parallel computing;critical path method;parity-check matrix;computer science;low-density parity-check code;algorithm design;compile time;ethernet;decoding methods;heuristic	Embedded	44.863913510719215	63.64076881862443	147175

However, adaptive modulation assuming perfect channel state information (CSI) is sensitive to CSI imperfections induced by estimation errors and feedback delays. In this paper, we design adaptive modulation schemes for multi-antenna transmission based on partial CSI, that models the spatial fading channels as Gaussian random variables with non-zero mean and white covariance, conditioned on feedback information. Based on a two-directional beamformer, our proposed transmitter optimally adapts the beam directions, the power allocation between two beams, and the signal constellation, to maximize the transmission rate while maintaining a target bit error rate (BER). Numerical results demonstrate the rate improvement, and illustrate an interesting tradeoff that emerges between feedback quality and hardware complexity.	modulation	Shengli Zhou;Georgios B.

The proposed LDPC decoder is characterized as follows: (i) The column operations follow the row operations in a pipelined architecture to ensure that the row and column operations are performed concurrently. (ii) The proposed parallel pipelined bit functional unit enables the column operation module to compute every message in each bit node which is updated by the row operations. These column operations can be performed without extending the single iterative decoding delay when the row and column operations are performed concurrently. Therefore, the proposed decoder performs the column operations more frequently in a single iterative decoding, and achieves a high-efficiency message-passing schedule within the limited decoding delay time. Hardware implementation on an FPGA and simulation results show that the proposed partially-parallel LDPC decoder improves the decoding throughput and bit error performance with a small hardware overhead. key words: low-density parity-check codes, partially-parallel LDPC decoder, message-passing algorithm, FPGA	algorithm;bit error rate;execution unit;field-programmable gate array;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;message passing;overhead (computing);schedule (computer science);simulation;throughput	Kazunori Shimizu;Tatsuyuki Ishikawa;Nozomu Togawa;Takeshi Ikenaga;Satoshi Goto	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e89-a.4.969	embedded system;parallel computing;message passing;real-time computing;soft-decision decoder;computer science;field-programmable gate array	Arch	44.95575187094594	62.143230077691385	147320

The proposed technique is based on Kalman filtering and decision feedback equalization. The time-varying channels can be estimated and tracked using a Kalman filter type of algorithm. An equalization technique for MIMO channels is derived based on a novel decision feedback equalizer structure. Moreover, we present a method to estimate the measurement and state noise variances used by the Kalman filter because they are crucial parameters in obtaining a reliable performance. The performance of the algorithm is investigated in simulations using realistic channels generated based on the COST 207 model. The results show that the algorithm performs well even in low SNR conditions or in difficult channel conditions. r 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It performs channel gain estimation and sequence detection by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Channel order estimation is included in the receiver to avoid unnecessary trellis computations by using the conditional model order estimator (CME). In addition, three modifications to the original CME criterion are proposed to improve the estimation accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed receiver has a slight degradation in frame error rate performance to the known channel maximum likelihood receiver. Moreover, it outperforms the conventional fixed long-tap length EM receiver with a lesser complexity. Furthermore, the proposed modifications to the CME criterion improve the channel order estimation accuracy, thus minimizing unnecessary computations.	akaike information criterion;computation;discriminative model;elegant degradation;error detection and correction;expectation–maximization algorithm;iteration;iterative method;kernel density estimation;mimo;mike lesser;simulation;trellis quantization	Daniel K.

A similar procedure is applied for detecting the presence of a second source as well as estimating its associated channel order and coefficients. When only estimated cumulants are available, we implement two hypothesis tests based on three proposed test-statistics.

This leads to the scenario where each different iterative decoder component of the receiver requires its own hardware. Owing to their relatively high complexity, many capacity-approaching techniques proposed in the literature have not yet been invoked in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications, despite their potential benefits of facilitating a reduced transmission power or extended communication range. Against this background, we propose an energy-efficient architecture comprised of multiple Computation Units (CUs), which is sufficiently flexible for accommodating different iterative decoder components using the same hardware. In this work, the flexible architecture is applied to Joint Source and Channel Coding (JSCC), comprising the Unary Error Correction (UEC) code, a turbo code, and an iterative demodulator. We conceive a flexible technique for controlling the hardware, which supports a high hardwareexploitation ratio for the CUs, reaching a utilization of 88%, compared to 68% achieved in similar solutions reported in the open literature.	channel capacity;computation;computational complexity theory;data rate units;iteration;iterative method;joint source and channel coding;throughput;turbo code;ubuntu;unary operation	Matthew F.

The ACO-based MUD aims to achieve a bit-error-rate performance approaching that of the optimum maximum-likelihood (ML) MUD, without carrying out an exhaustive search of the entire MC DS-CDMA search space constituted by all possible combinations of the received multiuser vectors. We will demonstrate that regardless of the number of the subcarriers or of the MFAA configuration, the system employing the proposed ACO-based MUD is capable of supporting 32 users with the aid of 31-chip Gold codes used as the T-domain spreading sequence without any significant performance degradation when compared to the single-user system. As a further benefit, the number of floating-point operations per second imposed by the proposed ACO-based MUD is a factor of lower than that of the ML MUD. We will also show that at a given increase of the complexity, the MFAA will allow the ACO-based MUD to achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio gain than the single-input-single-output MC DS-CDMA system.	ant colony optimization algorithms;beamforming;benchmark (computing);bit error rate;brute-force search;code;elegant degradation;flops;mud;mathematical optimization;multi-function printer;multi-user;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;subcarrier;telecommunications link;x.690	Chong Xu;Bin Hu;Lie-Liang Yang;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2008	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2007.905617	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Mobile	45.87655866929154	72.65390450573807	147718

This is useful in communication systems where the combination of modulation, interleaving, and error correction is used. The new algorithm is attractive to implement since traceback techniques can be used and only a little extra memory is required to obtain the soft information associated with every symbol. Furthermore, the operations involved are not recursive and the execution is time independent of the received signal quality. The performance of the new algorithm is typically within 0.25-0.1 dB (bit error rate (BER) = 10-l) of that of a significantly more complex algorithm reported previously.	algorithm;bit error rate;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;error detection and correction;forward error correction;modulation;recursion;x.690	Bjarne Risløw;Torleiv Maseng;Odd Trandem	1996	IEEE Trans.

This proposed scheme can achieve full diversity at full transmission rate on the assumption of quasi-static flat fading channels. We describe a unified approach to design criteria exploiting the parallel factor (PARAFAC) tensor decomposition to express the precoding tensor in terms of a set of component matrices. The scheme is more general and flexible than existing orthogonal space-time codes and space-time linear constellation precoding schemes, and hence can offer better performance for both real and complex constellations. In particular in this paper we introduce a scheme based on Vandermonde matrices for substream allocation.	code;coding gain;full rate;mimo;vandermonde matrix	Di Liu;Alister G.

In principle, the extrinsic LLR should obey Gaussian distribution for the sake of reducing computational complexity in the MAP decoder. However, channel estimation errors deteriorate Gaussianity of the LLR derived by conventional definition. In order to guarantee the Gaussianity, this paper defines alternative extrinsic LLR according to mean square error (MSE) of channel estimates. The derivation of proposed LLR is extended to an iterative channel estimation scenario. We will demonstrate that the proposed extrinsic LLR is capable of improving bit error rate (BER) performances.	bit error rate;channel state information;computational complexity theory;iterative method;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;mean squared error;performance;x.690	Hiroyuki Sasaki;Shinsuke Ibi;Seiichi Sampei	2013	2013 IEEE 78th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2013.6692205	normal distribution;electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics;iterative method;computational complexity theory;statistics	Vision	47.29137548499075	74.29302230379203	148761

Its underlying principle is that, given a modulation scheme and pulse-shaping and/or channel filter, the modulated signal has a unique statistical distribution, and any impairment in the analog/RF circuit distorts its output statistical distribution. The difference between the ideal and the output statistics contains the impairment information, and can be used to design the equalizer. Computer simulations have shown that the type-based technique can accurately determine the equalizer required to effectively equalize the group delay response, thereby significantly improving the system performance.	delay equalization;distortion;equalization (communications);group delay and phase delay;modulation;noise shaping;pulse shaping;radio frequency;simulation	Xinping Huang;Mario Caron	2010	Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5536987	computer simulation;probability distribution;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;control theory	EDA	52.71560085327087	68.50000665462898	148854

Naturally adapting to channel states without channel knowledge at the transmitter, fountain codes have recently been demonstrated also as an appealing solution for communication over fading channels. However, their relatively high decoding complexity limits their practical use in a wireless setting. In this paper, we present a simple modification of the decoding algorithm for Raptor codes - a type of fountain codes - over fading channels, where the complexity is significantly reduced without sacrifice of performance.	algorithm;binary erasure channel;code (cryptography);fountain code;raptor code;transmitter	Ketai Hu;Jeff Castura;Yongyi Mao	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.873	block code;list decoding;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;online codes;fountain code;telecommunications;sequential decoding;computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;bcjr algorithm;tornado code;linear code;luby transform code;raptor code;error floor;code;statistics;computer network	Theory	40.25374166400813	64.51609490679219	148969

EE-GLDPC codes are systematic codes and well-suited for puncturing, thus they are able to address a rate constraint issue, which is an obvious disadvantage of traditional GLDPC codes. In this work, we propose systematic puncturing algorithms for EE-GLDPC codes. Simulation results show that the systematic puncturing has considerable performance improvement over random puncturing. In addition, the punctured codes, like their mother codes, have the advantage of good error floor performance, which can be a very important feature in practical applications. Finally, it is also demonstrated that, compared with LDPC codes, GLDPC codes have a better error floor performance, but suffer from a decoding threshold loss at high puncturing rates; nonetheless the tradeoff between error floor and decoding threshold loss can be conveniently implemented via the method of doping.	doping (semiconductor);error floor;greedy algorithm;low-density parity-check code;puncturing;qr code;simulation	Tingjun Xie;Stephen G.

We propose to apply the Maximum Likelihood (ML) principle in order to compute the coefficients of a multidimensional Decision-Feedback Equalizer (DFE) that generalizes the classical DFE structure to the MIMO case. The equalizer coefficients are numerically computed by means of the Space Alternating Generalized Expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. This algorithm is known to present local convergence problems due to the existence of multiple maxima in the likelihood function. To avoid this limitation, we suggest to incorporate a small number of a priori known symbols into the transmitted data. Since the aim of these symbols is not to improve performance but just to avoid misconvergence, we term the resulting equalizer as semiblind.	channel state information;coefficient;download;equalization (communications);expectation–maximization algorithm;integrated circuit;iterative method;local convergence;mimo;maxima and minima;numerical analysis;viterbi decoder	Mónica F.

On the other hand, proper early termination leads to reduced decoding latency without compromising the performance. For inter-block permuted turbo codes (IBP-TC), however, the termination time variation over blocks within the interleaving span necessitates a new design paradigm. We use both cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code and sign check to make a termination decision and generate soft information for unterminated neighboring blocks at the same time. The new decoder that combines the features of iterative decoding and variable stopping time not only yields less average decoding delay but also outperforms its fixed-stopping-time counterpart by 0.2 - 0.3 dB.	algorithm;ampersand;cyclic redundancy check;error detection and correction;forward error correction;iterative method;newman's lemma;programming paradigm;turbo code	Yan-Xiu Zheng;Yu Ted Su	2004	2004 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (IEEE Cat.

Rate 3/4, small memory codes are found which are optimized in the free-distance sense on the Gaussian channel. These codes provide up to 4.8 dB of coding gain with 32 states over uncoded 8-PSK, a scheme having the same spectral efficiency as the codes described. The performance is compared with earlier findings of Ungerboeck and some recent results on R = 2/3 coded 8-PSK. In addition, we present results of a channel transmission study to assess the performance of the four-state code on the band-limited nonlinear channel, and find that performance of the coded scheme degrades comparably with uncoded 8-PSK, i.e., coding gain is roughly preserved.

To calculate weights for interference suppression, instantaneous correlations of the received signals and channel responses corresponding to the desired signals have to be estimated. However, due to smaller size of each cluster for clustered OFDM than for classical OFDM, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based estimator has large leakage and results in severe performance degradation. Therefore, a polynomial-based parameter estimator is proposed to combat the severe leakage of the DFT based estimator. We study the impact of the polynomial order and window size on the estimation error. An approximately optimal window size for the polynomial-based estimator is obtained and an adaptive algorithm for the optimal window size is developed. With the adaptive algorithm, the polynomial-based estimator has no leakage and does not require channel statistics. Simulation results show that the developed algorithm improves the performance significantly.	adaptive algorithm;discrete fourier transform;elegant degradation;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;polynomial;simulation;spectral leakage;window function;zero suppression	Hua Zhang;Geoffrey Ye Li	2004	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2004.837652	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics	Metrics	50.596490877554835	73.97900141096906	150027

In this paper, we describe a low-rate superorthogonal turbo code that combines the principles of low-rate convolutional coding and that of parallel concatenation. Due to the bandwidth expansion, this code outperforms the ordinary turbo code both in AWGN and especially in fading channels. Thus, superorthogonal turbo codes are suited mainly for spread-spectrum applications. For the purposes of iterative decoding, we concisely describe the connection between the optimal maximum a posteriori symbol estimation and suboptimal soft-output decoding based on sequence estimation. The suboptimal decoder produces outputs that can directly be used as additive metrics at successive decoding iterations, without the need for estimating channel noise variance. Simulation results in AWGN and flat Rayleigh fading channels are also presented, along with analytical upper bounds of bit- and frame-error probabilities.	additive white gaussian noise;performance evaluation;rayleigh fading;turbo code	Petri Komulainen;Kari Pehkonen	1998	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.661108	concatenated error correction code;turbo equalizer;turbo code;convolutional code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;spread spectrum;error floor;fading;statistics	Mobile	43.21448939034787	69.13184552331451	150046

The `-th stopping redundancy is the minimum number of rows in the parity-check matrix of a code, which contains no stopping sets of size up to `. In this work, a notion of coverable stopping sets is defined. In order to achieve maximum-likelihood performance under iterative decoding over the BEC, the paritycheck matrix should contain no coverable stopping sets of size `, for 1 ≤ ` ≤ n − k, where n is the code length, k is the code dimension. By estimating the number of coverable stopping sets, we obtain upper bounds on the `-th stopping redundancy, 1 ≤ ` ≤ n − k. The bounds are derived for both specific codes and code ensembles. In the range 1 ≤ ` ≤ d − 1, for specific codes, the new bounds improve on the results in the literature.

The detectors operate on data symbols and approximate decision variables, producing timing error measurement robust to channel fading. In addition to the estimator S-curve, we obtain the estimation error variance and TED SNR, with the analysis carried out under the assumptions of perfect data and channel knowledge at the receiver. Simulations are used to examine the effects of decision errors on the detector characteristics, and to evaluate the overall system performance, where the proposed TEDs are incorporated into the receiver timing loop. Receivers with perfect channel knowledge and pilot-based channel estimation are considered. Symbol error rate results show timing synchronization loss of less than 0.5 dB for a receiver with perfect channel information.	approximation algorithm;channel state information;computer simulation;discrete cosine transform;error detection and correction;exponential hierarchy;reversing: secrets of reverse engineering;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio	Pawel A.

Recently, new types of ECCs have been proposed which permit error-free data transmission over noisy channels at rates which approach the Shannon capacity. For wireless communication, these new codes allow more data to be carried in the same spectrum, lower transmission power, and higher data security and compression. One new type of ECC, referred to as \Turbo Codes,"""" has received a lot of attention, but is computationally expensive to decode and di cult to realize in hardware. Low Density Parity Check Codes (LDPCs), another ECC, also provide near Shannon limit error correction ability. However, LDPCs use a decoding scheme which is much more amenable to hardware implementation. This paper will rst present an overview of these coding schemes, then discuss the issues involved in building an LDPC decoder using recon gurable hardware. We present a hypothetical LDPC implementation using a commercial FPGA, which will give an idea of future research issues and performance gains.

The new representation lends itself to a simple measure of reliability based on the sum of inner products, and provides a quantifiable definition for minimum distance of a STBC. This provides the framework for a new family of near-maximum-likelihood (ML) and ML decoding algorithms. It also has applications in the development of optimality test criteria for STBCs, as well as in the design of STBCs with low decoding complexity.	algorithm;automatic vectorization;block code;decoding methods	Jeff Leuschner;Shahram Yousefi	2007	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/CISS.2007.4298429	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Vision	42.46037765416957	71.24943675224402	150422

Finding the optimum wordlength for digital circuit systems is difficult because the trade-off between the hardware cost and system performance is not conclusive. Actual circuit systems have large wordlengths at the circuit design level to avoid calculation errors caused by a lack of dynamic range. This indicates that power dissipation can still be reduced under better conditions. We propose a tunable wordlength architecture that dynamically changes its own wordlength according to the communication environment. The proposed OFDM demodulator measures error vector magnitudes (EVMs) from de-modulated signals and tunes the wordlength to satisfy the required quality of communication by monitoring the EVM performance. The demodulator can reduce dissipated energy by a maximum of 32 and 24% in AWGN and multipath fading channels.

Methods of producing the weight spectra of turbo codes have been investigated and many improvements were made to refine the techniques. A much faster method of weight spectrum evaluation has been developed that allows calculation of weight spectra within a fews minutes on a typical desktop PC. Simulation results show that new high performance turbo codes are produced by the optimisation methods presented. The two further important areas of concern are the code itself and the decoding. Improvements of the code are accomplished through optimisation of the interleaver and choice of constituent coders. Optimisation of interleaves can also be accomplished automatically using the algorithms described in this work. The addition of a CRC as an outer code proved to offer a vast improvement on the overall code performance. This was achieved without any code rate loss as the turbo code is punctured to make way for the CRC remainder. The results show a gain of 0.4dB compared to the non-CRC (1014,676) turbo code. Another improvement to the decoding performance was achieved through a combination of MAP decoding and Ordered Reliability decoding. The simulations show a performance of just 0.2dB from the Shannon limit. The same code without ordered reliability decoding has a performance curve which is 0.6dB from the Shannon limit. In situations where the MAP decoder fails to converge ordered reliability decoding succeeds in producing a codeword much closer to the received vector, often the correct codeword. The ordered reliability decoding adds to the computational complexity but lends itself to FPGA implementation.	algorithm;code rate;code word;computational complexity theory;concatenated error correction code;converge;cyclic redundancy check;decoding methods;field-programmable gate array;forward error correction;map;mathematical optimization;noisy-channel coding theorem;shannon (unit);simulation;turbo code	Andrew John Rogers	2013			concatenated error correction code;turbo code;serial concatenated convolutional codes;bcjr algorithm	HPC	42.28237530043034	61.85253433903553	150815

In this paper, we carry on the study and the evaluation of this quantization-based approach. We especially focus on the use of a Trellis Coded Quantization (TCQ) and its impact on the Hyper-Cube performances. First, we recall the TCQ functioning principle and we propose adapted quantizers. Second, we analyze the integration of the TCQ module in a cascade of two coders (resp. two decoders). Finally, we experimentally compare the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art of high-rate watermarking schemes. The obtained results show that our Multi-Hyper-Cube scheme always provides good average performances.	cube;digital watermarking;experiment;hyper-heuristic;performance;quantization (signal processing);tagged command queuing;trellis quantization	Marc Chaumont;Dalila Goudia	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo	10.1109/ICME.2011.6012007	discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;encoding	Vision	42.14035651691321	64.59526857459802	150848

Turbo equalization for Reed Solomon (RS) code, which is a popular error-correction code in wireless communication and recording systems, is seldom discussed in the literature. In this paper, we investigate the computational complexity and performance of turbo equalization which exploits three different kinds of equalization algorithms, i.e., BCJR, M-BCJR and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) algorithms. An adaptive belief propagation (ABP) algorithm is used for the decoding of RS code. Simulation results show that, the complexities of the LMMSE and M-BCJR based equalizers are much lower than that of the BCJR based equalizer, and at the same time the performance loss is still acceptable.	alternating bit protocol;bcjr algorithm;belief propagation;computational complexity theory;equalization (communications);error detection and correction;forward error correction;interference (communication);iteration;mean squared error;performance;reed–solomon error correction;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;software propagation;turbo code;turbo equalizer;x.690	Wenwen Wang;Yong Liang Guan;Ping Yang;Xiaobei Liu	2015	MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357543	turbo equalizer;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes	HPC	43.91209350618584	67.29935774130624	151123

We propose a new hardware architecture that can share hardware resources for the two standards. It mainly consists of eight retimed radix-4 soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoders to achieve high throughput and a dual-mode parallel hardware interleaver to support both almost regular permutation (ARP) and quadratic polynomial permutation (QPP) interleavers defined in the two standards. A prototype chip supporting both Mobile WiMAX and 3GPP-LTE standards is fabricated in a 0.13µm CMOS technology with eight metal layers. The decoder core occupies 10.7mm2 and can exhibit a decoding rate of more than 100Mb/s with eight iterations while achieving an energy efficiency of 0.31nJ/bit/iter.	cmos;compaq lte;forward error correction;iteration;megabit;polynomial;prototype;quadratic function;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder;throughput	Ji-Hoon Kim;In-Cheol Yong Park	2009	2009 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference	10.1109/CICC.2009.5280790	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;hardware architecture;cmos;mobile computing	EDA	45.45140971083847	62.629847206749524	151239

In this paper, a space time frequency (STF) code is presented with reduced decoder complexity and to achieve code rate $$\text{ M }_\mathrm{T}$$ with full diversity of $$\text{ M }_{\mathrm{T}} \text{ M }_{\mathrm{R}} \text{ N }_{\mathrm{b}}$$ L i.e., product of number of transmit antennas ( $$\text{ M }_\mathrm{T}$$ ), receive antennas $$(\text{ M }_{\mathrm{R}})$$ , fading blocks $$(\text{ N }_{\mathrm{b}})$$ and channel taps (L). The maximum achievable diversity with high rate of STF block coded MIMO-OFDM is analyzed and verified by simulation results. The decoder complexity is resolved by employing several approaches like maximum likelihood (ML), sphere decoder (SD) and array processing. The performance of STF code is compared with existing layered algebraic STF code in terms of decoder complexity and bit error rate (BER). Further, the closed form expressions for BER performance of STFBC MIMO-OFDM systems are derived and evaluated for frequency selective block fading channels with MPSK constellations.	mimo;mimo-ofdm	Bhasker Gupta;Davinder S.

An intercross linear mapping rule that distributes the output bits of an RSC to the different positions of different transmitted signals is also described. The proposed ReC-STC can not only increase the data rate with the number of transmit antennas, but also performs well when it is used in a serially concatenated space-time code (SCSTC). The convergence analysis shows that ReC-STC based SCSTC has a lower decoding threshold than the available SCSTC.	concatenation;convolutional code;multiplexing;recursion;uncompressed video	Ying Li;Xudong Guo;Xinmei Wang	2005	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2005	10.1109/WCNC.2005.1424546	convolutional code;convergence;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;mathematics;convolution;space–time code;fading;statistics;diversity gain	Vision	43.287662836802376	69.56224884681387	151331

Overlapping PPM (OPPM) allows multiple positions per pulsewidth, as well as fractional modulation indices (number of pulsewidths per frame) requiring more refined timing than that needed for conventional disjoint PPM (DJPPM). It is shown that even at moderate values of the expected photon count per pulse (Q) --such as needed for high data rates--OPPM outperforms on-off keying (OOK) in both capacity and cutoff rate, even though OOK is uniformly superior to DJPPM. Moreover, efficient use of OPPM is possible with equiprobable input symbols, whereas OOK requires inconvenient asymmetrical inputs to achieve capacity and high cutoff rate efficiencies (nats/ photon). At lower data rates, where capacity efficiency is the prime criterion, a significant advantage (- 20 percent) over DJPPM can be achieved up to efficiencies of about 0.7 nats/ photon. The M-ary photon-limited OPPM channel can be viewed as an ambiguity and erasure channel, in the sense that some channel outputs are ambiguous in only some input symbols and only if no photons are counted is there ambiguity in all input symbols. For large M ambiguities cause bursts of erasures of data symbols. Massey's interlaced encoding, as well as conventional encoding followed by interleaving, are adaptable to this bursty channel, and effect an increase in its cutoff rate comparable to the increase obtainable with DJPPM by the same techniques.	modulation	Israel Bar-David;Gideon Kaplan	1984	IEEE Trans.

Multidimensional (MD) signaling can be combined with MC to further increase the data rate with fixed spreading factor per symbol. In connection with this MDMC signaling, the proposed SML detection achieves significantly improved symbol-error probability, compared with other detection methods, both without soft sequential decoders for a tractable analysis.

In the hybrid scheme, CDMA is used to suppress the interference caused by the laser nonlinearity in the subcarrier multiplexing (SCM) fiber-optic communication systems. Likewise, the SCM scheme is able to increase the channel data rate of CDMA systems. This hybrid system combines the advantages of both schemes and is particularly well suited to subband coding that divides the image information into multiple parallel data streams using an analysis filter bank, each of which is transmitted via a unique subcarrier-code pair, where the spreading code and subcarrier frequency correspond to the image and one of its subbands, respectively. This hybrid scheme also allows more than one image to be transmitted and be accessed simultaneously at the same channel bandwidth, in which each image is assigned a particular spreading code added to its digital data modulating the subcarrier. After transmission, each received signal is independently recovered at a high-Q surface acoustic wave (SAW) receiver with the matching subcarrier-code pair. Other concurrent signals are rejected by the SAW. Then, all the recovered subbands are reassembled by a synthesis filter bank into a close reproduction to the original image. In this paper, the image quality of subband image transmission via CDMA/SCM fiber-optic channels is evaluated and examined.	acoustic cryptanalysis;data rate units;digital data;fiber to the x;fiber-optic communication;filter bank;hybrid system;image quality;interference (communication);nonlinear system;optical fiber;sub-band coding;subcarrier multiplexing	Po-Rong Chang;Chih-Chiang Chan	1996	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.545709	local area network;image quality;sub-band coding;code division multiple access;telecommunications;computer science;optical fiber;surface acoustic wave;filter bank;band-pass filter;communications system;visual communication;computer network;hybrid system	Mobile	49.0857300427943	67.5855527116679	151997

Their performance is compared with equivalent channel coded systems employing linear dispersion codes (LDC's) in terms of the maximum achievable mutual information between the transmitted and the received symbol vector and the average end-to-end mean-square error. The input signal is modeled as a memoryless, zero-mean, unit variance, Gaussian random variable and the wireless channel considered is the slow Rayleigh fading channel. Simulation results show that the frame based JSCC system not only has better performance in terms of the end-to-end mean square error but also achieves a higher mutual information as compared to equivalent LDC based channel-coded systems.	code;distortion;end-to-end principle;linguistic data consortium;mimo;mean squared error;mutual information;rayleigh fading;simulation;transmitter;vector quantization	Robin D.

This extends previous work using linear programming (LP) to decode linear block codes. First, a multistage LP decoder based on the branch-and-bound method is proposed. This decoder makes use of the maximum-likelihood-certificate property of the LP decoder to refine the results when an error is reported. Second, we transform the original LP decoding formulation into a box-constrained quadratic programming form. Efficient linear-time parallel and serial decoding algorithms are proposed and their convergence properties are investigated. Extensive simulation studies are performed to assess the performance of the proposed decoders. It is seen that the proposed multistage LP decoder outperforms the conventional sum-product (SP) decoder considerably for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with short to medium block length. The proposed box-constrained quadratic programming decoder has less complexity than the SP decoder and yields much better performance for LDPC codes with regular structure	block code;block size (cryptography);branch and bound;lp-type problem;linear code;linear programming decoding;low-density parity-check code;multistage amplifier;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;parallel algorithm;quadratic programming;simulation;time complexity	Kai Yang;Jon Feldman;Xiaodong Wang	2006	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2006.879405	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;soft-decision decoder;computer science;linear programming;mathematics;error floor;quadratic programming	ML	42.84383794182332	60.71160077977791	152253
345b536b9f3477074482937e816f8bf5f3f67678	an efficient scma codebook design based on 1-d searching algorithm		This letter proposes an efficient sparse code multiple access (SCMA) codebook design, in which 1-D searching algorithm is introduced to minimize the upper bound of pair-wise error probability (PEP). Firstly, an SCMA signal model is given according to superposition modulation. Our analysis shows that under the proposed amplitude and phase rotation settings, each user has the same mutual information lower bound. In addition, the superimposed constellation points on each sub-channel belong to the same set, which depends on only one amplitude variable. Therefore, 1-D searching on this variable is introduced and the performance metric is upper bound of PEP. It is demonstrated that the calculated upper bound can well predict the receiver performance with maximum likelihood detection. In addition, the performance of the proposed codebook is verified with message passing algorithm at the receiver.

Both receivers perform maximum a posteriori data detection and decoding, and operate semiblindly by making use of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the unknown channel. The first receiver utilizes a supertrellis to jointly describe the channel and the code, while in the second one, this description is accomplished with two separated trellises. The two approaches are compared in terms of trellis complexity, achievable diversity level, and bit error rate (BER). The supertrellis approach is less computationally demanding and has a faster convergence rate, while the separate approach can achieve a higher diversity level and thus a smaller BER. This tradeoff is explored with examples and computer simulations, which show that, in many cases, the supertrellis approach can be a better solution than the separate approach	bit error rate;computation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;em (typography);expectation–maximization algorithm;forward error correction;information sciences institute;iteration;modulation;rate of convergence;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;trellis quantization;uncompressed video;x.690	Richard Demo Souza;Javier Garcia-Frias;Alexander M.

By relaxing the orthogonality constraint, however, it is possible to achieve full rate or even rates higher than one for any number of transmit antennas at the expenses of loosing some degree of diversity advantage. On the other hand, if a feedback channel is available and the fading coefficients are known at the transmitter, then maximum diversity advantage can be achieved with transmit antenna selection. In this paper, a new full-rate nonorthogonal space-time block code for three transmit antennas is proposed that needs only two RF chains, has decoding delay equal to two, and whose maximum likelihood decoder based on linear processing is the same as that of the Alamouti code. We then introduce hybrid transmit antenna/code selection. Based on the instantaneous fading coefficients, the transmitter selects either the proposed code with the best three antennas or the Alamouti code with the best pair of antennas. Simulations results for up to six transmit antennas and one receive antenna indicate that full diversity is achieved in spite of using a nonorthogonal code. With this simple example, coding gains of up to 0.4 dB over the pure antenna selection with Alamouti, proposed by Gore and Paulraj (2002), is also observed.	block code;coefficient;decoding methods;full rate;gore (segment);radio frequency;transmitter	Renato Machado;Bartolomeu F.

In BPS (also called beam pattern oscillation), controlled time varying weight vectors are applied to the antenna array elements mounted at the base station (BS). This creates a small movement in the antenna array pattern directed toward the desired user. In rich scattering environments, this small beam pattern movement creates an artificial fast fading channel. The receiver is designed to exploit time diversity benefits of the fast fading channel. Via the application of simple combining techniques, BPS improves the probability-of-error performance and network capacity with minimal cost and complexity. In this work, to highlight the potential of the BPS, we compare BPS and Space-Time Coding (i.e., STBC and STTC) schemes. The comparisons are in terms of their complexity, system physical dimension, network capacity, probability-of-error performance, and spectrum efficiency. It is shown that BPS leads to higher network capacity and performance with a smaller antenna dimension and complexity with minimal loss in spectrum efficiency. This identifies BPS as a promising scheme for future wireless communications with smart antennas.	discrete cosine transform;radiation pattern;smart antenna;spectral efficiency;trellis quantization	Peh Keong Teh;Seyed Alireza Zekavat	2009	IJCNS	10.4236/ijcns.2009.26051	space–time block code;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;antenna array;transmit diversity;computer network	Networks	43.45464626990581	70.24871080364431	153257

The first stage is the active user identification and the second one is the multi-user detection. Most of the proposed active user identification methods fail to work in overloaded CDMA systems (when the number of users is more than the spreading factor). In this paper we propose a joint active user identification and multi-user detection for binary input CDMA systems using the Viterbi algorithm. We will show that the proposed identification/detection method is Maximum A posteriori Probability (MAP) and outperforms the pervious results. In addition, some suboptimum decoders will be proposed that have lower computational complexities but lower performances.	analysis of algorithms;mud;multi-user;performance;viterbi algorithm	Ping Pad;Ali Mousavi;Ali Goli;Farrokh Marvasti	2011	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2011.040111.102320	code division multiple access;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;markov process;statistics	Vision	47.73263018565997	73.03144988760033	153551

The DM receiver obtained performs joint channel estimation, multiuser decoding, and noise- covariance estimation. While its structure is similar to that of many ad-hoc receivers in the literature, the DM receiver is the result of applying a formal framework for optimization without further simplifications, namely the DM approach with a factorizable auxiliary model distribution. The well-known expectation- maximization (EM) algorithm and space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm are special cases of degenerate model distributions within the DM framework. Furthermore, many ad-hoc receiver structures from literature are shown to represent approximations of the proposed DM receiver. The DM receiver has four interesting properties that all result directly from applying the formal framework: (i) The covariances of all estimates involved are taken into account, (ii) The residual interference after interference cancellation is handled by the noise-covariance estimation as opposed to by LMMSE filters in other receivers, (iii) Posterior probabilities of the code symbols are employed rather than extrinsic probabilities, (iv) The iterative receiver is guaranteed to converge in divergence. The theoretical insights are illustrated by simulation results.	approximation;channel capacity;channel state information;code word;coefficient;converge;exptime;energy minimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;hoc (programming language);holism;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;multi-user;nonlinear system;programming paradigm;relevance;semiconductor industry;simulation;singular value decomposition;softcoding;software framework;the matrix;variational principle;whole earth 'lectronic link	Bin Hu;Ingmar Land;Lars Kildeh&#x00F8;j Rasmussen;Romain Piton;Bernard Henri Fleury	2008	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2008.080403	mathematical optimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;computer science;mathematics;statistics	ML	47.21446588283848	73.66881340781019	153742

Then, an upper bound on orthogonality error is derived for the HFRANS algorithm, which is much more numerically stable compared to FRANS.

The decision statistic is modelled as a Gaussian random variable, whose mean and variance can be expressed as functions of moments of (R ~ I), where R is the correlation matrix of signature sequences. Since the complexity of calculating these moments increases rapidly with the growth of the stage index, a graphical representation of moments is developed to facilitate the computation. Propositions are presented to relate the moment calculation problem to several well known problems in graph theory, i.e., the coloring, the graph decomposition, the biconnected component, and the Euler tour problems. It is shown that the analytic results of the bit error probability match well with simulation results.	biconnected component;bit error rate;computation;euler method;eulerian path;graph coloring;graph theory;graphical user interface;interference (communication);multistage amplifier;simulation	Chien-Hwa Hwang;Chung-Su Su Kim;C.-C.

A description is given of new estimators that are developments of the simple estimator but make no use of any knowledge of the number of different paths. The new estimators have performances intermediate between those of the simple and improved estimators, but are only a little more complex than the simple estimator. The new estimators are studied for a particular QPSK modem that operates at 4800 b/s over voiceband HF radio links. Results of computer simulation tests are presented, comparing the accuracies of the channel estimates given by different estimators, and hence suggesting the most suitable of these. >		Andrew P.

The CSI time delay and estimation error are modeled by the channel time variation model and stochastic error model, respectively. The conditional probability density function of the ideal CSI upon the estimated CSI is computed based on these two models, and it is used to derive the conditional expectation of the mean square error (MSE) between estimated and desired signals upon estimated CSI, which is minimized to optimize the beamforming and equalization coefficients. Computer simulations show that the proposed method obtains lower bit error rate (BER) than the conventional minimum MSE and the maxmin SNR strategies when CSI contains time delay and estimation error.	anisotropic filtering;beamforming;bit error rate;broadcast delay;channel state information;coefficient;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;minimax;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;x.690	Hua-Peng Zhao;Chuanyi Pan	2014	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2013.2292939	electronic engineering;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;error exponent;correlation;statistics	Metrics	39.947625037769775	73.81467604232436	154871

However, we encounter a problem when hybrid automatic repeat request (H-ARQ) systems are applied. Frequent failures of decoding at low SNR region imply that the decoder reaches the maximum number of iterations frequently and thus the decoding complexity increases. In this paper, we propose a combination of stopping criteria using the syndrome weight of tentative codeword. By numerical analysis, it is shown that the decoding complexity of given H-ARQ system is reduced by 70-80% with the proposed algorithms. ※ 본 연구는 교육인적자원부, 산업자원부, 노동부에 의해 추진된 최우수 연구실 지원사업과 지식경제부 및 정보통신연구진흥원의 IT 핵심기술개발사업[2008-F-007-01, 3차원 환경에서의 지능형 무선 통신 시스템]의 일환으로 수행되었습니다. * 서울대학교 전기·컴퓨터공학부 부호및암호연구실 및 뉴미디어통신공동연구소 ({thechi76,jsno}@snu.ac.ac.kr) ** 성균관대학교 정보통신공학부 통신및부호이론연구실 (iamshkim@skku.edu) *** 한양대학교 전자컴퓨터통신공학부 부호및통신연구실 (djshin@hanyang.ac.kr) 논문번호:KICS2008-05-250, 접수일자:2008년 5월 27일, 최종논문접수일자 : 2008년 9월 3일 I. 서 론 1993년 Berrou 등은 Shannon의 한계에 근접하는 성능의 터보 부호(turbo code)를 제안하였다. 이 연구 결과는 실현이 어려운 것으로 여겨졌던 Shannon의 채널 용량(channel capacity)을 실용적 한국통신학회논문지 '08-09 Vol. 33 No. 9 684 복잡도로 실현 가능함을 최초로 보임으로써, 뒤를 이은 관련 분야 연구의 기폭제가 되었다. 실제로 터 보 부호의 복호는 부호의 길이에 대하여 선형 복잡 도를 갖는 알고리듬 을 반복적으로 적용함으로써 실현 가능한 복잡도를 갖는다는 점에서 큰 의의가 있다. 터보 부호의 발견에 영향을 받아 실용적 복잡도 의 복호 방식을 가지며 채널 용량에 근접하는 성능 을 갖는 low-density parity-check(LDPC) 부호가 재 발견 되었다 . LDPC 부호는 신뢰 전파 알고리듬 (belief propagation algorithm)이라는 선형 복잡도의 알고리듬의 반복적인 수행으로 복호가 가능하다. 터 보 부호와 LDPC 부호는 탁월한 복호 성능을 인정 받아 다양한 무선 통신 표준의 오류정정부호로 채 택되었다 . 터보 부호나 LDPC 부호의 복호가 실현 가능한 복잡도로 구현될 수 있지만 여전히 높은 계산 복잡 도를 필요로 한다. 이에 따라 복호기의 계산 복잡도 를 줄이기 위하여 반복 복호 중단 기법(stopping criteria)에 관한 연구들이 진행되어 왔는데, 그 대표 적인 예로 교차 엔트로피 중단 기법과 경판정 보조 중단 기법을 들 수 있다 . LDPC 부호의 경우 복호 결과가 유효 부호어에 도달하였을 때, 복호를 중단하는 신드롬 검사 혹은 패리티 검사 중단 기법이 있다 . 신드롬 검사 중단 은 신뢰 전파 복호 고유의 중단 기법으로, 복호 성 능의 저하 없이 매우 우수한 중단 성능을 보인다. 이는 터보 부호와 비교되는 장점 중 하나다. 지금까지 반복 복호의 중단 기법에 대한 연구는 주로 복호기가 전송된 부호어로 성공적으로 수렴한 경우 불필요한 반복 복호를 막기 위한 것이었다. 때 문에 낮은 패킷 오율을 보이는 높은 신호 대 잡음 비(signal-to-noise ratio; SNR) 영역이 주요 관심 영 역이었고 이러한 영역에서는 효과적인 중단 성능을 달성할 수 있었다. 하지만 이러한 반복 복호 부호가 Hybrid-ARQ (H-ARQ) 전송 기법과 결합되는 경우 새로운 문제 가 발생한다. H-ARQ 전송 기법을 사용하는 경우 주어진 변조 부호율이 최대의 효율을 보이는 SNR 에서 높은 비율로 재전송이 이루어지게 되는 것이 일반적이다. 즉, 수신기에서는 복호 불가능한 수신 신호에 대해 복호 시도를 하게 되는 경우가 많아진 다. 이러한 경우 복호기가 정해진 최대 반복 복호 횟수까지 동작하게 되어 복호기의 계산 복잡도를 상승시킨다. 그러므로 H-ARQ가 적용된 시스템에서 는 결국 복호 실패로 귀결될 낮은 SNR 입력에 대 해서 초기에 성공적으로 복호 중지 판정을 내려주 는 기법으로 계산 복잡도를 크게 감소시키는 것이 중요하다. 가능한 방법으로 SNR과 같은 채널 관찰 값이나 복호기 입력 메트릭의 통계를 이용한 중단 을 가정할 수 있으나, 상용 시스템에서는 채널의 빠 른 변화 등의 요인으로 log likelihood ratio(LLR)를 정확하게 계산하기 힘든 경우가 많다. [9]에서는 신뢰 전파 복호의 특성을 관찰하고, 각 단계의 출력 LLR의 절대값의 합의 수렴여부를 이 용한 복호 중단 기법을 제시하였고, 이는 많은 복호 불가능한 프레임을 미리 판정하여 낮은 SNR에서 계산 복잡도를 크게 낮추었다. [10]에서는 위와 독 립적으로 출력 LLR의 절대값의 평균의 수렴을 이 용한 중단 기법을 제시하였다. 이 방법들은 먼저 다 수의 부동점 연산 혹은 많은 비트의 고정점 연산을 요구하므로, 다소 높은 복잡도가 요구된다. 또한, 중 단 기법의 성능이 파라미터의 변화나, 채널 변화, LLR 계산 오류 등에 민감한 단점을 갖고 있다. [11]에서는 [9]의 관찰 및 중단 전략을 참조하여, LDPC 복호 과정에 포함되는 패리티 검사 결과 즉, 출력 LLR의 경판정 벡터의 신드롬 벡터 만을 이용 한 효과적인 중단 기법을 제시하였다. [11]의 기법 은 AWGN 뿐 만 아니라, 레일리 페이딩 채널 (Rayleigh fading channel)에 동시에 좋은 중단 성 능을 보인다는 큰 의미를 갖는다. [9]-[11]의 정지 기법들은 실제로 복호 성공이 불 가능한 프레임을 미리 판정할 수 있어, 논문에서 고 려하는 H-ARQ가 적용된 시스템을 위한 반복 복호 중단 기법으로 사용이 가능하다. 하지만, 현재까지 이러한 중단 기법에 의한 H-ARQ 에서의 복잡도 감소 이득이 평가된 바가 없었다. 또한, 상기 기법 들은 매우 열악한 채널을 거쳐 복호 시도를 할 필 요가 없는 프레임이라 하더라도, 상당한 수의 반복 복호를 거친 후 복호 실패 판정을 하는 문제를 갖 는다. 본 논문에서는 [11]에서와 같이 신드롬 벡터의 해밍 무게(Hamming weight)만을 이용하는 효율적 인 반복 복호 중단 기법을 제시한다. 제안 기법은 H-ARQ 시스템의 특성 상 많은 복호 실패 및 재전 송이 발생할 수 있으므로, 더 열악한 채널을 겪은 프레임일수록 빨리 중단 판정을 하는 것을 목표로 한다. 특히, 제안 기법은 다양한 크기의 LDPC 부 호 및 채널에 대하여 공통된 기법을 적용하는 것이 가능하며, 특히 입력 메트릭의 스케일링에 오류가 논문 / H-ARQ 시스템에서 LDPC 부호의 반복 복호 중단 기법 685 그림 1. 복호 실패하는 경우의 반복 복호 수에 따른   추이 (IEEE802.16e LDPC 부호, N=2304, R=0.5,    (실선),    (점선)). 있는 경우에도 안정적으로 동작한다. 제안 기법은 매우 적은 계산량으로 효과적인 중단 성능을 보이 며, 특히 H-ARQ 시스템에서 극적인 복잡도 감소 효과를 얻게 한다. 본 논문의 구성은 다음과 같다.

Future products are likely to adopt multiple antennas to maximize performance. Severe FCC EIRP restrictions impose an interesting system design constraint. In this paper, capacity optimal multiple antenna transmission schemes are investigated for EIRP restricted systems under the assumption that the channel is known at the transmitter. It is shown that per subcarrier antenna power allocation, which reduces to antenna selection at low SNR or when using one receive antenna, is optimal for some transmitter configurations. The improvements in capacity are quantified for representative channels.	data rate units;design closure;gigabit;mimo;mobile device;signal-to-noise ratio;smart antenna;subcarrier;systems design;transceiver;transmitter;ultra-wideband	Cheran M.

33329d1b3338825a98ba2ba33fe9449a65d2c612	mutual information as a figure of merit for optical fiber systems		Advanced channel decoders rely on soft-decision decoder inputs for which mutual information (MI) is the natural figure of merit. In this paper, we analyze an optical fiber system by evaluating MI as the maximum achievable rate of transmission of such a system. MI is estimated by means of histograms for which the correct bin number is determined in a blind way. The MI estimate obtained this way shows excellent accuracy in comparison with the true MI of 16-state quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over an additive white Gaussian noise channel with additional phase noise, which is a simplified model of a nonlinear optical fiber channel. We thereby justify to use the MI estimation method to accurately estimate the MI of an optical fiber system. In the second part of this work, a transoceanic fiber system with 6000 km of standard single-mode fiber is simulated and its MI determined. Among rectangular QAMs, 16-QAM is found to be the optimal modulation scheme for this link as to performance in terms of MI and requirements on components and digital signal processing. For the reported MI of 3.1 bits/symbol, a minimum coding overhead of 29% is required when the channel memory is not taken into account. By employing ideal single-channel digital back-propagation, an increase in MI by 0.25 bits/symbol and 0.28 bits/symbol is reported for 16-QAM and 64-QAM, respectively, lowering the required overhead to 19% and 16%. When the channel spacing is decreased to be close to the Nyquist rate, the dual-polarization spectral efficiency is 5.7 bits/s/Hz, an increase of more than 2 bits/symbol compared to a 50 GHz spacing.	additive white gaussian noise;backpropagation;bandwidth (signal processing);blind equalization;center channel;channel (communications);channel memory;channel spacing;coherence (physics);data rate units;digital back-propagation;digital camera back;digital signal processing;fibre channel;forward error correction;interaction;modulation;mutual information;noise (electronics);nonlinear system;nyquist rate;optical fiber;overhead (computing);phase noise;requirement;soft-decision decoder;software propagation;spectral efficiency;transmitter;uncompressed video;utility functions on indivisible goods;wavelength-division multiplexing	Tobias Fehenberger;Norbert Hanik	2014	CoRR		telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	45.498471183768295	67.4903121070551	155595

We consider the design of a closed-loop channel state information feedback scheme, where user terminals feed back their channel state information simultaneously to a multi-antenna base station. The underlying information theoretic problem consists of lossy source-channel coding of multiple independent analog sources (i.e., the users' channel coefficients) over a Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output multi-access channel (MIMO-MAC). Unlike the classical source-channel coding setting, this application requires low latency, otherwise the channel state information would be outdated. Hence, source-channel codewords can span only a single fading state of the uplink (feedback) channel. Furthermore, the transmitters are ignorant of the realization of the uplink channel coefficients. In this scenario, the scaling of the maximum of the estimated downlink channel mean-square errors with the SNR dominates the performance of the multiuser downlink. This scaling is described by the distortion SNR exponent, previously introduced in a single-user MIMO setting. This paper analyzes the max-min distortion SNR exponent of the MIMO-MAC for both separated source-channel coding, and a particular hybrid digital-analog joint source-channel coding scheme. For the case of single-antenna users, we prove that the distortion SNR exponent of separated source-channel coding can be achieved by the concatenation of scalar quantization and uncoded quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) transmission, with lattice decoding at the base-station receiver. The resulting scheme has very low encoding latency (only a few symbols of the uplink slot) and generally outperforms currently proposed channel state feedback schemes based on analog unquantized transmission or vector quantization with fixed codebooks.	channel capacity;channel state information;code word;codebook;coefficient;concatenation;distortion;dynamic range;hd radio;hurst exponent;image scaling;information theory;interference (communication);lossy compression;mimo-ofdm;maxima and minima;mean squared error;modulation;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;overhead (computing);quantization (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;systems design;telecommunications link;transmitter;vector quantization	K.

These distortions make the matter of power efficiency prevail over spectral efficiency in satellite communication systems. Nowadays, the use of satellite segments for applications requiring ever increasing data rates puts this principle in question. The present article proposes to fight non-linear distortion caused by satellite amplifiers by resorting to simple neural network equalisation devices in the receiving earth terminals. Several neural network equalisers are introduced, and applied to a satellite Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (S-UMTS) channel model. They are shown not only to outperform conventional equalisation techniques like the linear transversal equaliser, but also to have better performance than the non-linear Volterra equaliser. The performance improvement is all the more sensitive as the modulation scheme used is severely distorted. The case of 16-QAM transmission over a mobile satellite link is studied in details.	adaptive equalizer;artificial neural network	Steven Bouchired;Daniel Roviras;Francis Castanie	1999	Space Communications		electronic engineering;systems modeling;waveform;equalization;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;amplifier;perceptron;comparative research;artificial neural network;quadrature modulation	HCI	49.25737823533944	71.57409589390774	155811

The selected transmit antennas are those that maximize the post-processing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver end. It is shown that the proposed TAS approach achieves a performance close to optimal selection based on exhaustive search, introduced in the literature, but at a lower complexity.

The method is hierarchical and uses auto-correlation for the first step and cross-correlation for the second step. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it reduces the computational complexity by a factor of five (80%), while achieving similar mean square error (MSE) as cross-correlation based methods. The method uses block-level parallelism for auto-correlation step, which speeds up the computation significantly. After fixed-point analysis, a parallel architecture is proposed to accelerate both coarse and fine synchronization steps.

The design paradigm is to provide more coding protection through iterative decoding to bits that are less protected by modulation (and are thus less reliable at the output of the demodulator). The design is carried out by an ad hoc search algorithm over the column permutations of the parity-check matrix. Our simulations show that the proposed reliability-based coded modulation scheme can improve the error-rate performance of conventional BICM schemes based on regular LDPC codes by a few tenths of a decibel, with no added complexity.	column (database);cyclic redundancy check;decibel;forward error correction;hoc (programming language);iteration;low-density parity-check code;modulation;parity bit;parity-check matrix;programming paradigm;search algorithm;simulation	Robert D.

An adaptive symbol detector is needed in the baseband receiver chain to achieve the desired flexibility of a CR system. This paper presents a novel design of an adaptive detector as an application-specific instruction-set processor (ASIP). The ASIP template is based on transport triggered architecture (TTA). The processor architecture is designed in such a manner that it can be programmed to support different suboptimal multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection algorithms in a single TTA processor. The linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) and three variants of the selective spanning for fast enumeration (SSFE) detection algorithms are considered. The detection algorithm can be switched between the LMMSE and SSFE according to the bit error rate (BER) performance requirement in the TTA processor. The design can be scaled for different antenna configurations and different modulations. Some of the algorithm architecture co-optimization techniques used here are also presented. Unlike most other detector ASIPs, high level language is used to program the processor to meet the time-to-market requirements. The adaptive detector delivers 4.88-49.48 Mbps throughput at a clock frequency of 200 MHz on 90 nm technology.	adaptive filter;algorithm;application-specific instruction set processor;baseband;bit error rate;clock rate;cognitive radio;data rate units;file spanning;high-level programming language;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;objective-c;requirement;signal processing;telecommunications link;throughput;transport triggered architecture;x.690	Shahriar Shahabuddin;Janne Janhunen;Essi Suikkanen;Heidi Steendam;Markku J.

Owing to use the variable number of output symbols and the number of priority levels as parameters in FSDD, the encoder can flexibly generate the suitable degree distribution for LT codes with UEP. Furthermore, the improved encoding algorithm, called FSDD-LT, is proposed. The performance of the proposed encoding algorithm is compared with other conventional LT codes with UEP under the same parameters in Binary Erasure Channel(BEC).	algorithm;alphabet (formal languages);code rate;coexist (image);compaq lte;degree distribution;encoder;fountain code;lr parser;luby transform code;soliton	Fa Cun Zhang;Xi Ying Duan;Meng Dong	2013	2013 Tenth International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks (WOCN)	10.1109/WOCN.2013.6616242	block code;erasure code;concatenated error correction code;binary code;binary erasure channel;transform coding;online codes;soliton;channel code;fountain code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;tornado code;linear code;luby transform code;raptor code;statistics	Robotics	42.14834886874145	65.58398074327792	157512

For this purpose, we start with a binary low-density generat ormatrix (LDGM) code, and construct the quantization codebook by periodically repeating its set of binary codewords, or them mapped to m-ary ones with Gray mapping. The quantization algorithm is based on belief propagation, and it uses a decim ation procedure to do the guessing necessary for convergence. Usi ng the results of a true typical decimator (TTD) as reference, i t is shown that the asymptotic performance of the proposed quant izer can be characterized by certain monotonicity conditions on the code’s fixed point properties, which can be analyzed with density evolution, and degree distribution optimization can be carried out accordingly. When the number of iterations is finite, the resulting loss is made amenable to analysis through the introduction of a recovery algorithm from “bad” guesses, and the results of such analysis enable further optimization ofthe pace of decimation and the degree distribution. Simulationresults show that the proposed LDGM-based quantizer can achieve a shaping gain of 1.4906 dB, or 0.0423 dB from the limit, and significantly outperforms trellis-coded quantization (TCQ) at a similar computational complexity.	algorithm;belief propagation;code word;codebook;computational complexity theory;decimation (signal processing);degree distribution;fixed point (mathematics);iteration;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;noise shaping;quantization (signal processing);software propagation;tagged command queuing;trellis quantization	Qingchuan Wang;Chen He	2008	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;degree distribution;index term;quantization;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;mean squared error;computational complexity theory;vector quantization;fixed-point property;belief propagation;source code	AI	40.34590351221139	63.377896895777916	157701

However, array LDPC codes do not support arbitrary code lengths, because the code length of an array LDPC code with good error rate performance is limited to a multiple of a prime number. This paper proposes Size Compatible (SC)-array LDPC codes; they achieve good error rate performance while supporting arbitrary code lengths. We conduct computer simulations to evaluate the block error rate (BLER) performance of SC-array LDPC codes in AWGN channels. We also evaluate the corresponding performance of SC-array LDPC coded multiband OFDM systems for data transmission rates over 1 Gbps in the UWB multipath channel model CM 3. We show that if the submatrix size is a non- prime number, SC-array LDPC codes achieve better error rate performance than the conventional array LDPC codes in AWGN channels. We also show that the SC-array LDPC codes achieve better error rate performance than the punctured array LDPC codes in AWGN channels. We also show that if the submatrix size is a prime number, SC-array LDPC codes achieve the same error rate performance as conventional array LDPC codes in AWGN channels. Moreover, we show that for multiband OFDM systems with data transmission rates of over 1 Gbps, SC-array LDPC codes achieve better error rate performance than conventional array LDPC codes.	additive white gaussian noise;arbitrary code execution;bit error rate;channel (communications);computer simulation;data rate units;dummy variable (statistics);low-density parity-check code;parity bit;performance;ultra-wideband;utility functions on indivisible goods	Daisuke Abematsu;Tomoaki Ohtsuki;Sigit P.

Recently, group theoretic ideals, especially fixed-point-free (fpf) groups, have been used to design fully diverse constellations of unitary matrices. Here we give a systematic method to design space-time codes which are appropriate for three-transmit-antenna differential modulation. The structure of the code is motivated by the Lie group SU(3). The code has a fast decoding algorithm using sphere decode. The diversity product of the code can be easily calculated and simulated performance shows that the code is better than the group-based codes especially at high rates and is as good as the elaborately-designed nongroup code.	algorithm;code;decoding methods;modulation;theory	Yindi Jing;Babak Hassibi	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2004.1326862	concatenated error correction code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;constant-weight code;linear code;mathematics;geometry;lie group;group code;statistics	Robotics	42.10949250020216	67.99490147890334	158150

In this scenario, the noise is characterized as being the sum of the interfering users' signals and additive Gaussian noise. The optimal receiver for DS/SSMA systems has a complexity that is exponential in the number of users. This prohibitive complexity has spawned the area of research on sub-optimal receivers with moderate complexity. Adaptive algorithms for detection allow for reception when the communication environment is either unknown or changing. Motivated by previous work with Radial Basis Functions (RBF's) for performing equalization, RBF networks that operate with knowledge of only a subset of the system parameters are studied. Although this form of detection has been previously studied (Group Detection) when the system parameters are known, in this work, neural network techniques are employed to adaptively determine unknown system parameters. This approach is further bolstered by the fact that the optimal detector in the synchronous case can be implemented by a RBF network when all of the system parameters are known. The RBF network's performance (with estimated parameters) is compared with the optimal synchronous detector, the decorrelating detector and the single layer perceptron detector. Clustering techniques and adaptive Least Mean Squares methods are investigated to determine the unknown system parameters. This work shows that the adaptive Radial Basis Function network attains near optimal performance and is robust in realistic communication environments .	algorithm;artificial neural network;decorrelation;feedforward neural network;least mean squares filter;multi-user;multiuser dos;perceptron;radial (radio);radial basis function network;time complexity;utility functions on indivisible goods	Urbashi Mitra;H.

The proposed PSM is an eminent coding method since the optimized redundancy rate by SP-CCDM is smaller than the one with conventional CCDM method. The change of constellation diagram under representative signal noise ratio rationalizes the root to corrupted signals during the investigation of spectral efficiency.

In this paper, an uplink model for multiuser distributed MIMO systems with wideband code-division multiple-access (CDMA) technology is presented. We focus on the case where there is no channel state information at the transmitter, but channel state information is assumed at the receiver. The spectral efficiency of the uplink system with single-user detectors at the base stations under multipath fading channels is investigated carefully. Two cases with different assumptions of interference knowledge are studied in detail. The spreading sequences of the CDMA systems are assumed to employ loosely synchronized (LS) spreading sequences and random spreading sequences respectively. LS spreading sequences exhibit a socalled interference free window (IFW), where both the auto-correlation and cross-correlation of the codes become zero. Therefore LS sequences have the promise of mitigating the effects of inter symbol interference (ISI) and multiple access interference (MAI) in multipath fading channels. It is shown by numerical results that the uplink spectral efficiency of the distributed MIMO-CDMA system using LS sequences can significantly outperform that of the system using random spreading sequences.

These transformations, referred to as dynamic algorithm transformations (DAT), jointly optimize algorithm and circuit performance measures such as signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and power dissipation (P,), respectively. A DAT-based signal processing system is composed of a signal monitoring algorithm (SMA) block and a signal processing algorithm (SPA) block. First, computation of the theoretical power-optimum SPA configuration incorporating signal transition activity is presented. Next, practical SMA schemes are developed, which achieved power reduction by a combination of powering down the filter taps and modifying the coefficients. The DAT-based adaptive filter is then employed as a near-end cross-talk (NEXT) canceller in 155.52 Mb/s ATM-LAN over category 3 wiring.

We propose new application fields of these codes in the particular context of three transmit antenna systems.

Furthermore, we demonstrate by simulation that the use of these codes in a turbo parallel concatenated scheme permits working very close to the channel outage probability.	code (cryptography);code word;coding gain;concatenation;convolutional code;downtime;modulation;performance;simulation;sun outage;trellis quantization	Guillaume Ferré;Jean-Pierre Cances;Vahid Meghdadi;Jean-Michel Dumas	2007	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2007.05488	block code;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	43.28582340370015	71.7722530325132	158951
3fcdc01dbcecec542788fa791797e434e2ffdf33	condensation methodologies for two-dimensional non-uniform constellations		Two-dimensional non-uniform constellations (2D-NUC) have been adopted for the most recent terrestrial broadcasting system called ATSC 3.0. They are known for being more efficient than one-dimensional non uniform constellations (1D-NUC) and uniform constellations (UC). They can be used in any communication system with the bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) structure. However, one of the main challenges of such constellations is their design for optimal behaviour in a wide range of cases and the design of a demapper that exploits their advantages. This paper presents two different condensation methodologies to design efficient 2D-NUCs simple in design and with limited demapping complexity. The proposal provides a complexity reduction of the design and demapping processes in the range from 13% to 94%.

In order to control the impact of intersymbol interference (ISI) on this channel, pulse shaping is required. This paper derives the minimum bandwidth, ISI-free Nyquist pulse which satisfies the amplitude nonnegativity constraint. The minimum bandwidth required is twice that of conventional electrical channels. With the addition of excess bandwidth, the optimal bandlimited optical intensity pulse, in the sense of minimizing average optical power, is shown to be a squared double-jump pulse. Thus, a bandwidth versus optical power efficiency tradeoff in pulse design is quantified. The impact of timing jitter on the probability of symbol error for various excess bandwidths is quantified via simulation. Further, it is shown that there are no bandlimited root-Nyquist pulses satisfying the amplitude nonnegativity constraint. In fact, all practical optical intensity root-Nyquist pulses are shown to be necessarily time-limited to a single symbol interval	approximation algorithm;bandlimiting;bandwidth (signal processing);baseline (configuration management);distortion;information sciences institute;interference (communication);matched filter;modulation;noise shaping;offset binary;performance per watt;pulse shaping;rate–distortion theory;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation	Steve Hranilovic	2007	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2006.888878	pulse shaping;electronic engineering;infrared;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;mathematics;bandwidth-limited pulse;nyquist rate;intersymbol interference	Theory	50.73698352355008	68.96706813989763	159142

Hence, suitable receivers need to support a large variety of modulation and channel coding schemes (MCS) while maintaining a low complexity. The performance and complexity of a multi-dimensional factor-graph based (MD-GSIR) framework for iterative joint channel estimation and data detection is investigated for the application of adaptive modulation and coding in an LTE environment. Three detection algorithms within the MD-GSIR framework are investigated and a novel tree-based detection is proposed. The versatile structure of the MD-GSIR concept offers a flexible trade-off between computational complexity and performance. Furthermore, the message exchange is adapted to support the irregular training structure which may occur in adaptive environments.	algorithm;channel capacity;channel state information;compaq lte;computational complexity theory;factor graph;forward error correction;iterative method;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;molecular dynamics;spectral efficiency	Christopher Knievel;Dapeng Hao;Peter Adam Hoeher;Petra Weitkemper;Hidekazu Taoka	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6655342	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;channel code;link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;radio receiver;computational complexity theory	Robotics	44.63935930529186	72.19800300597164	159702

EMG signals consist of a superposition of delayed finite-duration waveforms that carry the information about the firing of different muscle fiber groups. The new approach is based on a communication technical interpretation of the EMG signal. The source is modeled as a signaling system with intersymbol-interference, which encodes a welldefined sparse information sequence. This point of view allows a maximum-likelihood(ML) as well as amaximum a posteriori(MAP) estimation of the underlying firing pattern to be made. The high accuracy attainable with the proposed method is illustrated both with measured and artificially generated EMG signals.	electromyography;interference (communication);signalling system no. 7;sparse matrix	Richard Gut;George S.

We focus on two schemes: spatial multiplexing in a BICM fashion and concatenation with the Alamouti code. We show that good SCLDGM codes designed for SISO channels also approach MIMO capacity in the Alamouti concatenated scheme. These codes, however, do not perform adequately in spatial multiplexing and, in this case, have to be specifically designed for each antenna configuration and modulation format. Decoding complexity in spatial multiplexing is larger but the performance is in general better because the Alamouti code reduces the MIMO channel capacity when there is more than one receiving antenna	channel capacity;code;concatenation;generator matrix;mimo;modulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;spatial multiplexing	Miguel González-López;Francisco J.

5b14511dd49af544220a28c5106861a41cf535c5	error resilience and energy efficiency: an ldpc decoder design study		Iterative decoding algorithms for low-density parity check (LDPC) codes have an inherent fault tolerance. In this paper, we exploit this robustness and optimize an LDPC decoder for high energy efficiency: we reduce energy consumption by opportunistically increasing error rates in decoder memories, while still achieving successful decoding in the final iteration. We develop a theory-guided unequal error protection (UEP) technique. UEP is implemented using dynamic voltage scaling that controls the error probability in the decoder memories on a per iteration basis. Specifically, via a density evolution analysis of an LDPC decoder, we first formulate the optimization problem of choosing an appropriate error rate for the decoder memories to achieve successful decoding under minimal energy consumption. We then propose a low complexity greedy algorithm to solve this optimization problem and map the resulting error rates to the corresponding supply voltage levels of the decoder memories in each iteration of the decoding algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via ASIC synthesis results of a decoder for the LDPC code in the IEEE 802.11ad standard, implemented in 28nm FD-SOI technology. The proposed scheme achieves an increase in energy efficiency of up to 40% compared to the state-of-the-art solution.	application-specific integrated circuit;dynamic voltage scaling;fault tolerance;greedy algorithm;image scaling;iteration;low-density parity-check code;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;optimization problem;parity bit	Philipp Schläfer;Chu-Hsiang Huang;Clayton Schoeny;Christian Weis;Yao Li;Norbert Wehn;Lara Dolecek	2016	2016 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)		list decoding;electronic engineering;real-time computing;soft-decision decoder;computer science;theoretical computer science;decoding methods	EDA	44.71871918531931	64.4199359717545	160806

Developed from the recently proposed iterative phase estimation schemes, the phase estimation and compensation process is embedded into the basic iterative turbo decoding process for the application to OFDM systems with just a slight complexity overhead. At each decoding iteration, sub-carrier phase rotations are estimated from the extrinsic information arranged in each sub-carrier and are compensated for the next decoding iteration. This enables the iterative phase estimation algorithm to successfully work under very low signal-to-noise ratios even without pilot symbols. The pilot symbols are just very rarely inserted only for breaking the erroneous phase estimation propagation frame to frame in case of large residual phase offset beyond reliable decoding range. Simulation results show that the iterative phase estimation algorithm drastically reduces the pilot insertion overhead and thus, it achieves improved spectral efficiency as well as bit error rate (BER) performance by saving pilot energy compared to the conventional method.	bit error rate;channel state information;embedded system;frequency divider;iteration;multiplexing;overhead (computing);quantum phase estimation algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;x.690	Kyuwon Choi	2010	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2009.0369	turbo code;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	48.766620012451824	73.20409398625367	161465

Since it may bring worse reliability, hybrid automatic repeat request (H-ARQ) is used in a second strategy. Simulation under typical urban channel is carried out, and the results show the proposed strategies can bring higher throughput, and the strategy with H- ARQ can improve throughput and guarantee reliable transmission simultaneously.	advanced mezzanine card;iteration;low-density parity-check code	Lihua Li;Mingyu Zhou;Haifeng Wang;Ping Zhang;Yongtai Xu	2008		10.1109/VETECS.2008.245	educational technology;electronic engineering;real-time computing;low-density parity-check code;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;statistics	NLP	41.85908934307004	68.77806627392953	161950

Another factor that can severely degrade receiver performances is the timing offset relative to the channel delay profile. In this paper we derive a novel receiver for turbo MIMO equalization in space-time-trellis-coded (STTrC) system to jointly address the problems described above. The equalizer is based on low complexity MMSE filtering. A joint detection technique of the several transmit antennas is used to reduce the receiver’s sensitivity to the spatial correlation at the transmitter and receiver sides. Furthermore, only the significant portion of the channel impulse response (CIR) is taken into account while detecting signals. The remaining portion of CIR is regarded as the unknown interference which is effectively suppressed by estimating its covariance matrix. By doing this the receiver’s complexity can be reduced since only a portion of the CIR has to be estimated and used for signal detection. Furthermore, by suppressing the interference from the other paths outside the equalizers coverage the receiver’s sensitivity to the timing offset can be reduced. The proposed receiver’s performance is evaluated using field measurement data obtained through multidimensional channel sounding. It is verified through computer simulations that the performance sensitivity of the joint detection-based receiver to the spatial correlation is significantly lower than with the receiver that detects only one antenna at a time. Furthermore, the performance sensitivity to the timing offset of the proposed receiver is shown to be significantly lower than that of the receiver that ignores the existence of the remaining multipath CIR components.

As opposed to standard product codes, we do not require that all component row codes nor all component column codes be the same. Relaxing this requirement can provide some additional attractive features such as allowing some regions of the codeword to be more error-resilient, providing a more refined spectrum of rates for finite lengths, and improved performance for some of these rates. We study these codes over erasure channels and prove that for any 0 <; ε <; 1, for many rate distributions on component row codes, there is a matching rate distribution on component column codes such that an irregular product code based on MDS codes with those rate distributions on the component codes has asymptotic rate 1 - ε and can decode on erasure channels having erasure probability <; ε (and having alphabet size equal to the alphabet size of the component MDS codes).	binary erasure channel;brute-force search;comefrom;code word;requirement;the matrix;universal product code	Masoud Alipour;Omid Etesami;Ghid Maatouk;Amir H.

They also used one D-lag decision-feedback maximum a posteriori (MAP) detector to detect the information bits. A straightforward extension (noniterative) to multiuser synchronous CDMA cases, i.e., adding the parallel interference cancellation (PIC) multiuser detector into their scheme, results in poor performance. Therefore, we propose an iterative scheme which combines vector channel estimation, decision-feedback MAP detection, and PIC. The partial PIC is applied in the sequence hypothesis stage of MAP in each iteration before the final MAP decision. The proposed scheme has twice the decision delay of the previous scheme for single-user cases. The performance of the proposed system in the time-selective, correlated multipath fading channel environment is investigated. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the noniterative scheme. Simulation results also show that the proposed scheme performs better than its scalar channel-estimation version.	channel state information;coefficient;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);iteration;multi-user;multipath propagation;simulation	Shu-Ming Tseng	2006	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2006.873069	parallel processing;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;iterative method;statistics	Mobile	48.69860503945152	73.30263894053724	162480

The decoding algorithm is based on minimization of a difference of two monotonic objective functions subject to the 0-1 constraint of bit variables. The iterative process converges to the global optimal ML solution after a finite number of steps. The proposed algorithm's computational complexity depends on the input sequence length k which is much less than the codeword length n, especially for codes with small code rates. The viability of the developed method is verified through simulations on different coding schemes.		Phan T.

It has been shown that optimization is greatly simplified if an estimate of the physical distance between DESs is available but this requires an adequate measuring and communication infrastructure making the micro grid smart. In this paper we propose to integrate communication and measuring by using a power line communication (PLC) infrastructure and estimating the distance by measuring the time of arrival (ToA) of the signals in PLC links among the DESs. We revise existing techniques for ToA estimate and apply them on realistic PLC scenarios.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of far-end crosstalk (FEXT) cancellation for DSL. We propose a new soft interference canceller for coordinated self-FEXT cancellation across multiple twisted-pairs. The proposed receiver treats the FEXT-impaired channel as a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel; it uses the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) technique to exploit the sequential structure inherent in iterative cancellation techniques for MIMO decoding. On telephone loops with strong FEXT, the proposed algorithm shows 0.5-dB coding gain with respect to previously proposed techniques. Furthermore, being soft-input-soft-output in nature, the proposed SMC receiver can iteratively exchange extrinsic information with a MAP decoder to successively cancel FEXT, leading to a turbo FEXT canceller.	algorithm;blast;coding gain;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;crosstalk;digital subscriber line;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;mimo;monte carlo method;simulation;twisted pair	Raju Hormis;Dong Guo;Xiaodong Wang	2005	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2005.852207	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method	EDA	46.81648570712277	74.280397647148	162897

In particular, the recursive-least-squares (RLS) and maximum-likelihood (ML) techniques are used to facilitate the Fisher estimation implementations. For the Bayesian estimation, the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) principle is employed in formulating the joint estimation problem. With known channel statistics, the MAP-based estimation is expected to provide better performance than the RLS- and ML-based ones. To avoid a possible identifiability issue in the joint estimation problem, various basis expansion models (BEMs) are deployed as fitting parametric models for capturing the time-variation of the channels. Numerical results and related Bayesian Cramér Rao bounds (BCRB) demonstrate that the deployment of BEMs is able to alleviate performance degradation in the considered estimation techniques using the conventional block-fading assumption over time-varying channels. Among the considered schemes, the MAP-based estimation using the discrete prolate spheroidal (DPS) or Karhuen Loève (KL) basis functions would be the best choice that can provide mean-squared-error (MSE) performance comparable to BCRB in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions (e.g., coded OFDM transmissions).	basis function;bim;carrier frequency offset;channel state information;committed information rate;computation;dimensionality reduction;elegant degradation;estimation theory;fisher information;formation matrix;frequency divider;gradient;imaginary time;kl-one;mean squared error;multiplexing;pictbridge;recursion;recursive least squares filter;signal-to-noise ratio;software deployment	Hung Nguyen-Le;Tho Le-Ngoc	2010	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2010.2055673	econometrics;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Vision	50.05045714130362	73.81358150771747	163794

We focused on rate-1/2 codes, suitable for low SNR regions, but the scheme is easily generalizable to different code rates. In particular our approach involves a proper combination of an LDPCC and a vector quantizer based on a convolutional code and directly allows for iterative softinformation exchanges between the respective decoders.

One major step of ASD decoding is the interpolation. Available interpolation algorithms can only add interpolation points or increase interpolation multiplicities. However, backward interpolation, which eliminates interpolation points or reduces interpolation multiplicities, is indispensable to enable the reusing of interpolation results in the following two scenarios: 1) interpolation needs to be carried out on multiple test vectors, which share common entries and 2) iterative ASD decoding where interpolation points have decreasing multiplicities. Examples for these cases are the low-complexity chase (LCC) decoding and bit-level generalized minimum distance (BGMD) decoding. With lower complexity, these algorithms can achieve similar or higher coding gain than other practical ASD algorithms. In this paper, we propose novel backward interpolation schemes and corresponding efficient implementation architectures for LCC and BGMD decoding through constructing equivalent GrOumlbner bases. The proposed architectures share computational units with forward interpolation architectures. Hence, the area overhead for incorporating the backward interpolation is very small. Substantial area saving or speedup can be achieved by using the backward interpolation. When the proposed architecture is applied to the LCC decoding of a (255, 239) RS code with eta = 3, the area is reduced to 39% of those required by prior architectures. In terms of speed/area ratio, the proposed architecture is 48% more efficient than the best available architecture. For the BGMD decoding of the same code, the proposed architecture can achieve around 20% higher efficiency.	algorithm;backward compatibility;bit-level parallelism;bivariate data;code;coding gain;computation;emoticon;gröbner basis;hp 48 series;interpolation;iterative method;monomial;overhead (computing);polynomial;reed–solomon error correction;speedup;time complexity;whittaker–shannon interpolation formula	Jiangli Zhu;Xinmiao Zhang;Zhongfeng Wang	2009	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2005575	discrete mathematics;interpolation;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;reed–solomon error correction;algorithm;statistics	Vision	44.15021958854551	61.11054231090517	164233

DVB-S2 standard specifies higher order modulation and powerful FEC system based on LDPC codes concatenated with BCH code. DVB-S2 has been gradually replacing DVB-S for global satellite digital TVs, and many HDTV channels are served by DVB-S2 standard in Europe and Japan. The proposed decoder architecture clusters bitnodes and checknodes into groups by utilizing of periodic nature of parity check matrix. Each of these node groups are assigned to a functional modules which perform calculations required at bitnodes and checknodes. These functional modules exchange data through shared memory banks to maximize parallel accesses.

In this paper, we systematically analyze the timing charts of both the Viterbi algorithm and the MAP algorithm. Then, three techniques, including Distribution, Pointer, and Parallel schemes, are introduced; they can be used as flexible tools in timing-chart analysis to either reduce memory size or to increase throughput rate. Furthermore, we propose a tile-based methodology to analyze the key features of timing charts, such as computing/memory units and hardware utilization. On the basis of the timing analysis, we developed a VA/MAP timing chart that has three modes (VA mode, MAP mode, and concurrent VA/MAP mode) by complementing the idle time of both VA and MAP decoding procedures. The new combined timing analysis helps us for constructing a unified component decoder with near 100% utilization rate of the processing element (PE) in both VA/MAP decoding functions. According to the triple-mode VA/MAP timing chart, we construct a triple-mode FEC kernel that can perform both Convolutional/Turbo decoding functions seamlessly for different communication systems. By integrating the FEC kernel with different size of memory, we can construct four types of FEC decoders for different application scenarios, such as 1) standalone Convolutional decoder (VA mode); 2) standalone Turbo decoder (MAP mode); 3) dual- mode Convolutional/Turbo decoder (VA mode and MAP mode); and 4) triple-mode Convolutional/Turbo decoder (VA mode, MAP mode, and concurrent VA/MAP mode). Finally, a prototyping FEC kernel processor that is compliant to 3GPP standard is verified in TSMC 0.18-mum CMOS process in the type of triple-mode FEC decoder.	authorization;cmos;chart;convolutional code;error detection and correction;forward error correction;ieee xplore;kernel (operating system);map;pointer (computer programming);prototype;static timing analysis;throughput;turbo code;viterbi algorithm	Fan-Min Li;Cheng-Hung Lin;An-Yeu Wu	2008	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2000514	turbo code;electronic engineering;convolutional code;real-time computing;soft-decision decoder;computer science;theoretical computer science;statistics	EDA	45.10598741597473	61.78861725122637	164590

In this paper, we propose a class of RC LDPC codes with a very wide range of code rates. To ensure linear encoding, dual-diagonal form for the parity part of the mother parity-check matrix is used. Constructed from shifted identity matrices, the proposed codes are particularly well-suited for the high-speed implementation of parallel encoders and parallel decoders. To widen the range of code rates, we have proposed an optimal transmission scheme, which keeps the optimal degree distribution unchanged for the mother code and all daughter codes. Thus, the proposed technique pushes the upper bound of code rates to 0.96, which is the highest rate in RC LDPC codes in the world, based on our best knowledge. The implementation results into field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices indicate that a parallel encoder (decoder) for the proposed RC LDPC codes is capable of reaching a throughput of 7.2 (1.8) Gigabits per second using a clock frequency of 150 MHz.	algorithm;clock rate;data rate units;degree distribution;electronic component;encoder;error detection and correction;field-programmable gate array;gigabit;list decoding;low-density parity-check code;parallel computing;parity-check matrix;performance;qr code;radiation hardening;throughput	Zhiyong He;Paul Fortier;Sébastien Roy;Hushan Xu	2014	2014 IEEE 12th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)	10.1109/NEWCAS.2014.6934013	block code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;electronic engineering;parallel computing;low-density parity-check code;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;tornado code;linear code;hamming code;mathematics;forward error correction;raptor code;error floor	HPC	44.37022179279289	62.381378165502696	164933

Using integer arithmetic and proper hardware management, an efficient implementation of a turbo decoder based on the modified form of max-log-MAP algorithm is proposed. All internal metrics are represented and operated on integers, avoiding complex calculation seen in floating and fixed-point arithmetic. The turbo decoder is implemented by a careful manipulation of the hardware with a single decoder structure without any interleaving and de-interleaving delay, resulting high data throughput with very low FPGA resource utilization. The final FPGA design consumes approximately 695 mW to achieve throughput of more than 1 Mbps with eight iterations. With channel inputs of only 3 bits (8 levels), the integer version of turbo decoder results in less than 0.5 dB loss of E/sub b//N/sub o/ from the optimal floating point turbo decoder.	field-programmable gate array	S.

In the letter, the widely used zero-padding scheme (ZPS) for direct GPS P-code acquisition is generalized to investigate the effects of the ZPS on detection performance, parallel searching capability, and mean acquisition time. It is shown that, by adjusting the zeros padded to received signal according to signal to noise ratio, the generalized zero-padding scheme (GZPS) makes a better tradeoff between detection performance and parallel searching capability and further reduces mean acquisition time. The generalized zero-padding scheme can be easily applied to the previously proposed zero-padding method (ZPM) and the direct average method (DAM) to improve their mean acquisition time performance and it does not increase the implementation complexity of a receiver.	global positioning system;horner's method;lifting scheme;microsoft p-code;newton's method;p-code machine;padding (cryptography);qr code;signal-to-noise ratio	H.

Based on an analysis of the BP process under ideal or non-ideal decimation, the algorithm first estimates the conditional probability distributions describing the effect of non-ideal decimation, then adjusts the priors to make the distributions match the ideal situation. As shown in simulation results, the recovery algorithm can improve quantization performance greatly, reducing the shaping loss to as low as 0.012 dB, while the increase in computational complexity is modest thanks to the use of FFT techniques.	algorithm;belief propagation;block code;computational complexity theory;control theory;decimation (signal processing);fast fourier transform;generator matrix;hoc (programming language);isometric projection;iteration;iterative method;mean squared error;noise shaping;norm (social);polar code (coding theory);portable document format;quantization (signal processing);simulation;software propagation;tagged command queuing;utility functions on indivisible goods;window function	Qingchuan Wang;Chen He;Ling-ge Jiang	2011	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2011.061511.100462	probability distribution;algorithm design;combinatorics;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;markov process;approximation algorithm;algorithm;statistics	Vision	45.63274228321692	70.37754579399824	166102

It supports multiple code-rates of 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6 and its architecture has been designed based on column layered decoding technique to enhance the convergence speed. The authors have suggested a register file based approach to handle the shift property of the modified parity check matrix and a modified version of the matrix permutation method has been introduced to reduce the number of check nodes which handle multiple messages. In addition, parallel processing has been incorporated in the decoder architecture to attain higher achievable throughput. This QC-LDPC decoder is implemented in 90 nm CMOS process and is post-layout simulated. It can achieve a throughput of 796 Mbps for a code-rate of 5/6. With 0.9 V supply, it consumes 146 mW of total power at 149 MHz clock frequency.	high-throughput computing;interoperability;low-power broadcasting;microwave;parity bit;throughput	Vijaya Kumar Kanchetla;Rahul Shrestha;Roy P.

Due to this procedure of performing measurements, the problem of interference caused by range ambiguities is of greater concern than in conventional non-polarimetric SAR. Such interference is made up by signals of different nature, depending on the order (even or odd) of the range ambiguity. In particular, odd-order range ambiguities generate an interference on crosspolar terms of the matrix, proportional to one of the copolar terms, which have typically a much greater magnitude. This drawback, that never occurs in non-polarimetric SAR systems, is a major source of measurement contamination, i n particular in the presence of range ambiguous echoes from areas which are illuminated at low incidence angles. In this paper, after discussing the influence of range ambiguities on the accuracy of scattering matrix measurement as performed by interleaved-pulse SAR, we examine the utility of appropriate interpulse phase coding strategies, to be devised and utilized with the purpose to reduce the interference due to range ambiguities and affecting those target scattering matrix elements, whose measurement is expected to be most critical.	incidence matrix;interference (communication);numerical aperture;polarimetry;polarization (waves);radar;the matrix;transmitter	Dino Giuli;Luca Facheris	1993	European Transactions on Telecommunications	10.1002/ett.4460040510	s-matrix;synthetic aperture radar;telecommunications;electrical engineering;coding;radar	Metrics	50.74116301568883	68.73308855910189	166612

This decoder is applicable to complex-valued unitary and nonunitary constellations suitable for differential modulation. The ML decoder helps to improve the diversity of the DF-based differential cooperative system using an erroneous relaying node. We also derive a piecewise linear (PL) decoder of the differential data transmitted in the DF-based cooperative system. The proposed PL decoder significantly reduces the decoding complexity, as compared with the proposed ML decoder, with no significant degradation in the receiver performance. Existing ML and PL decoders of the differentially modulated uncoded data in the DF-based cooperative communication system are only applicable to binary modulated signals like binary phase shift keying and binary frequency shift keying, whereas the proposed decoders are applicable to complex-valued unitary and nonunitary constellations suitable for differential modulation under uncoded transmissions. We derive a closed-form expression of the uncoded average symbol error rate (SER) of the proposed PL decoder with M phase-shift keying constellation in a cooperative communication system with a single relay and one source-destination pair. An approximate average SER by ignoring higher order noise terms is also derived for this setup. It is analytically shown on the basis of the derived approximate SER that the proposed PL decoder provides full diversity of second order. In addition, we also derive the approximate SER of the differential DF system with multiple relays at asymptotically high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the source-relay links. It is shown by simulations that the proposed PL decoder in the differential DF cooperative system with more than one relay also achieves the maximum possible diversity.	approximation algorithm;consensus dynamics;direction finding;elegant degradation;key (cryptography);modulation;piecewise linear continuation;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Manav R.

Raptor codes have been a preferred technology for the forward error correction (FEC) at the application layer for several important consumer applications like Internet Protocol TV (IPTV). Raptor GF(256) code is proposed for reducing the redundant FEC information to a minimum. However, the improved coding performance comes at the expense of increased encoding and decoding complexity. On the other hand, graphics processing units (GPUs) have become a common place in the consumer market and are finding their way beyond graphics processing into general purpose computing. This paper investigates the suitability of GPU for Raptor GF(2) and GF(256) codes to process large block and symbol sizes in FEC transmission. The serial and parallel implementations of Raptor GF(2) and GF(256) codes are explored on the CPU and GPU platforms, respectively. Our work shows that efficient parallelization on the GPU improves the decoder performance significantly. To understand the performance bottlenecks of Raptor GF(2) and GF(256) codes on both the CPU and GPU platforms, the decoding speed is evaluated for different block and symbol sizes. Furthermore, simulations are performed for the practical realtime requirement in multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS) and digital video broadcasting (DVB) for the bearer speed of 21 MHz in high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) network1.	algorithm;ampersand;central processing unit;computer graphics;data rate units;digital video broadcasting;error detection and correction;forward error correction;fountain code;graphics processing unit;iptv;multimedia broadcast multicast service;network packet;parallel computing;raptor code;simulation;telecommunications link	Linjia Hu;Saeid Nooshabadi;Todor Mladenov	2013	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2013.6490270	parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;forward error correction;raptor code;finite field	HPC	44.764819435385206	62.74660740128288	166924

In many communication scenarios, the transmitters are required to support both coherent and non-coherent forms of reception thereby requiring the transmission protocols to be designed such that the transmitted data is decoded reliably at both coherent and non-coherent receivers. Further, in such scenarios, for practical purposes, the transmitter is assumed to be agnostic to the type of the intended receiver, making the design more challenging. Thus motivated, we propose a transmission mechanism for simultaneous reception by coherent and noncoherent receivers. This transmission is enabled by ternary codes, i.e., codes over the ternary alphabet: {-1, 0, +1}. The design of these ternary codes, which exhibit good correlation properties for both coherent and non-coherent reception is a major contribution of this paper. Simulation results show that the proposed codes provide almost similar performance as the optimal codes meant for the respective receiver types.	code;coherence (physics);download;simulation;transmitter	Sujit Jos;Thejaswi P.

A new concept called channel residual energy (CRE) is introduced. We show that by minimizing CRE, we can jointly estimate the transmitter and receiver I/Q mismatches without knowing the channel information. The optimal solution is given in closed form. Once we have the I/Q parameters, an estimate of the channel response can be obtained by simple substitution. The proposed method needs only one OFDM block for training and the training data can be arbitrary. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve a good performance.	channel state information;frequency divider;in-phase and quadrature components;multiplexing;simulation;transmitter	Yuan-Hwui Chung;See-May Phoong	2009	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2009.090100	transmitter;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	50.947596180237255	73.38191680427877	167032

Finally, through BER simulations and FPGA synthesis results we demonstrate the suitability of our CLLL processor for integration into a 64-QAM MIMO system.	algorithm;field-programmable gate array;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point arithmetic;lr parser;lattice reduction;mimo;microarchitecture;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;very-large-scale integration;x.690	Brian Gestner;Wei Zhang;Xiaoli Ma;David V.

Based on the derived expectation, the bias-property of the s ample auto-correlation matrix is analyzed with respect to the total squared error (TSE) and the eigen-structure. And accordingto the analyses, when the sample auto-correlation matrix is us ed to estimate the signal and noise subspaces, BPSK may not be a good choice for modulation of pilot tones, which contradicts with the experience of most current OFDM systems. Numerical results demonstrate this bias-property and the analyses onit.	autocorrelation;channel state information;eigen (c++ library);frequency divider;modulation;multiplexing	Xiaochuan Zhao;Tao Peng;Ming Yang;Wenbo Wang Beijing University of Posts;Telecommunications;Beijing;China C	2008	CoRR		covariance matrix;index term;telecommunications;information theory;mathematics;channel state information;least squares;fading;statistics	ML	41.377658722085805	74.19772746120641	168159

The amount of the interference can be handled by adjusting transmit power and time of each transmitter and repeater. Hence, it is crucial to estimate the individual reception power from each transmitter or repeater at the given point of interest. This paper presents an efficient method to estimate the individual reception power from each transmitter or repeater. The field test results are provided to evaluate the proposed method. The proposed method exploits the transmitter identification (TxID) signals which are embedded in existing 8-VSB signals.	atsc standards;advanced television systems committee;dbm;embedded system;interference (communication);newton's method;point of interest;single-frequency network;terrestrial television;transmitter	Sung Ik Park;Heung Mook Kim;Wangrok Oh	2009	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2009.2025458	transmitter;electronic engineering;digital television;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;signal processing;transmitter power output;repeater	Mobile	51.02700113022033	72.1293390503036	168408

This work utilizes frequency-domain channel estimator (FD-CE) and decision-feedback aliasing canceller (DF-AC) to produce single-FFT SC-FDE. In this way, non-CP single-carrier block transmission (SCBT) can be decoded using sphere decoder of MIMO-OFDM modems to support multimode and backward compatibility under an acceptable complexity in IEEE 802.11 very high throughput (VHT). An iV-point FFT is sufficient to measure channel frequency responses (CFR) from .L-sample preambles (L ≤ JV/2). And then, M-bit block codes (M ≤ L) are decodable over frequency domains with DF-AC's help. Simulations and measurements imply that this work can ensure adequate performance, even if there is no CP existed against the distortions of multipath propagation.	adobe framemaker;aliasing;backward compatibility;block code;computer simulation;direction finding;distortion;equalization (communications);fast fourier transform;frequency response;gigabit;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modem;multipath propagation;network packet;software propagation;throughput	Shau-Yu Cheng;Chueh-An Tsai;Terng-Yin Hsu	2011	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2031137	block code;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;mathematics	Visualization	51.62907686887114	72.57960922682201	169658

We present a general density evolution-based procedure which finds the optimal puncturing of a based code. We show that puncturing can be performed across a range of rates and code lengths in a manner that produces punctured codes with good thresholds. This allows one to implement a single optimal LDPC code of a low rate that can be punctured across a wide range of rates without loss of threshold performance. Simulation results show that the error floors of the codes do not degrade after puncturing.	low-density parity-check code;puncturing	Jeongseok Ha;Steven W.

4fe3ca1d4a4d3bef2629da9930c8b92b95641228	a contribution to the reduction of the dynamic power dissipation in the turbo decoder	power dissipation;turbo decoding	In the field of mobile communication systems, the energy issue of a turbo decoder becomes an equivalent constraint as throughput and performance. This paper presents a contribution to the reduction of the power consumption in the turbo decoder. The main idea is based on re-encoding technique combined with dummy insertion during the iterative decoding process. This technique, name ”Toward Zero Path” (TZP) helps in reducing the state transition activity of the Max-Log-MAP algorithm by trying to maintain the survivor path on the ’zero path’ of the trellis. The design of a turbo decoder based on the TZP technique, associated with different power reduction technique (saturation of state metrics, stoping criterium) is described. The resulting turbo decoder was implemented onto a Xilinx VirtexII-Pro FPGA in a digital communication experimental setup. Performance and accurate power dissipation measurements have been done thanks to dynamic partial reconfiguration of the FPGA device. The experimental results have shown the interest of the different contributions for the design of turbo decoders.	algorithm;application-specific integrated circuit;cmos;code rate;dummy variable (statistics);field-programmable gate array;iteration;throughput;trellis quantization;turbo pascal;turbo code	Haisheng Liu;Christophe Jégo;Emmanuel Boutillon;Michel Jézéquel;Jean-Philippe Diguet	2012	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/s12243-011-0274-7	turbo equalizer;electronic engineering;real-time computing;soft-decision decoder;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;dissipation	EDA	45.30280775388625	63.187080219822775	170120
cd08596c0a4a8b2f7b115e799a30cd14dd69007a	joint doa estimation and source number detection for arrays with arbitrary geometry		In this paper, we focus on the problem of joint direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and source number detection for an array of sensors. We propose a CLEAN-based sequential algorithm that uses a sequential hypothesis testing procedure. This method can be employed for any array with an arbitrary geometry. We also manage to reduce the computational complexity of the proposed method. Additionally, we derive an analytical performance bound for the source number detection algorithm. Our simulation results show that the proposed method achieves an appropriate performance even for low SNR or small number of snapshots. It is shown that the proposed method is applicable to both correlated and uncorrelated sources. Unlike popular methods, the algorithm does not require to know the number of sources for the DOA estimation and is able to estimate the number and the DOA of sources jointly. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed scheme is based on the analog linear coding and the discrete Fourier transform. A remarkable feature of our scheme is that it does not require knowing the correlation matrix of the data blocks, and therefore, it can be used even if the correlation matrix changes slowly with time.	discrete fourier transform;distortion;linear code;mean squared error;scheme	Xabier Insausti;Pedro M.

This requires the use of a dirty-paper code, in which each message is represented by a large number of alternative vectors. Most previous dirty-paper codes are based on lattice codes, in which each code vector, or pattern, is a point in a regular lattice. While such codes are very efficient to implement, they suffer from inherent weakness against valumetric scaling, such as changes in audio volume or image brightness. In the present paper, we present an alternative to lattice codes that is inherently robust to valumetric scaling. This code is based on a trellis that has been modified so that each bit value may be coded by traversing several alternative arcs. A Viterbi decoder is used in the detector to identify the path with the highest correlation to the input Work. Since relative correlation values are unaffected by valumetric scaling, the same message will be detected no matter how the input has been scaled.	convolutional code;digital watermarking;image scaling;trellis quantization;viterbi decoder	Matthew L.

We introduce a fully pipelined turbo equalization architecture that combines soft decoders for the channel and the LDPC code. This equation based LDPC decoder uses a signed sum product (SSP) decoding algorithm, and stores soft information for each equation, in contrast to each edge in conventional LDPC decoders. The memory size of the LDPC decoder is greatly reduced, and the delay of the LDPC decoder is absorbed by the delay of the soft channel detector.	algorithm;decoding methods;information sciences institute;interference (communication);low-level reader protocol;low-density parity-check code;on the fly;soft-in soft-out decoder;turbo equalizer	Zining Wu;Greg Burd	2005	Proceedings.

Such a statement on performance loss is due to the assumption of using an independent identically distributed complex Gaussian vector as channel input. By removing this assumption, we find that the diversity performance of MIMO linear receivers can be significantly improved. In an extreme case, it can be the same as that of ML receivers. Specifically, in this paper, we investigate the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) performance of MIMO linear receivers with colored and possibly degenerate Gaussian channel inputs. By varying the rank of the covariance matrix of the channel input vector and by allowing temporal coding across multiple channel uses, we show that the MIMO linear receiver can achieve a much better DMT performance than the currently known one. Explicit optimal code constructions are provided, along with simulation results, to justify the above findings. For the case of (2 × 2) and (3 × 3) MIMO linear receivers, simulation results show that the newly proposed codes provide significant gains of 10 and 12.08 dB in Eb/N0 at bit error rate 10-4 compared to the conventional schemes, respectively.	additive white gaussian noise;bit error rate;code;digital monetary trust;eb/n0;gaussian elimination;mimo;multiplexing;neural coding;simulation	Ti-wen Tang;Min-Kun Chen;Hsiao-feng Lu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2012.2230348	covariance matrix;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;gaussian process;communication complexity;mathematics;radio receiver;signal-to-noise ratio;multiplexing;encoding;statistics;mimo	Networks	41.76435191452488	72.25037183259079	170802

The metric is formed by combining the channel output and the a-priori information. The parallel structure of the proposed method is suitable for hardware parallelization. The radius of the sphere and the value of m are selected according to the channel condition to reduce the complexity. Numerical results are provided showing a significant reduction in the average complexity (for a similar performance and peak complexity) as compared to the best earlier known method.

The stochastic SMC-based constellation classification (SMC-CC) sampler generates constellation symbol samples based on importance sampling and resampling techniques, whereas the deterministic SMC-CC approach recursively performs exploration and selection steps in a greedy manner. Then the constellation classification is achieved according to the distribution of the drawn samples in both the stochastic SMC-CC and the deterministic SMC-CC. Moreover, both the proposed methods are achieved along with joint estimation of transmitted data symbols and channel taps. Simulations show that the proposed methods perform well on various constellations with different cardinalities, as well as constellations with symbols.	interference (communication);monte carlo method;particle filter	Jianping Zheng;Baoming Bai;Ying Li	2010	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-009-9781-5	particle filter;telecommunications;importance sampling;computer science;mathematics;intersymbol interference;statistics	Mobile	47.97199410519366	70.51993775431939	171703

The analysis focuses on the case of many users, and large spreading sequences such that their ratio, which is the system load, is kept fixed. Spectral efficiency of practical linear detectors such as match-filter and decorrelator employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver is derived. This is used to extend the notion of strongest users detectors for SIC receivers. The strongest users detectors system design relies on an outage approach where each user transmits in a single layer (fixed rate), and only users experiencing good channel conditions may be reliably decoded, while the other users are in outage, i.e., not decoded. In this scheme, iterative SIC decoding is studied, and it is shown that for equal power users, the optimal rate allocation, for maximizing the expected spectral efficiency, is equal rates for all users. This outage approach analysis is extended for multilayer coding broadcast approach per user. The expected sum-rate, under iterative decoding with linear multiuser detectors, is optimized, and the optimal layering power distribution is obtained. For small system loads, the achievable spectral efficiency with the continuous broadcast approach and a linear matched filter detector exhibits significant gains over the single layer coding approach.	bell laboratories layered space-time;broadcast domain;code;downtime;interference (communication);iterative method;load (computing);matched filter;multi-user;randomness;sensor;simplified instructional computer;spectral efficiency;sun outage;systems design	Avi Steiner;Valentin Lupu;Uri Katz;Shlomo Shamai	2012	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2012.2184663	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;matched filter	Mobile	44.71548978874495	73.58308643272656	171830

In this paper we introduce how SISO sphere detectors based on enhancements of single tree search and tuple search algorithms can be efficiently used in iterative detection, outclassing previously proposed decoders or list based iterations. The complexity of the proposed algorithms can be significantly reduced by MMSE preprocessing in combination with a novel unbiased and separated candidate assimilation.

A natural split of precoder-design is unitary precoding and non-unitary precoding. Unitary precoding is only performing rotation of the data in a way beneficial for the channel. Non-unitary precoding additionally also uses power-loading to further improve the performance. Somewhat surprisingly, unitary precoding facilitates a performance boosting by a re-enumeration of the antenna elements at the receiver side that can not be accomodated in the non-unitary precoding setting. This operation leads to substantial performance gains. The question investigated in this paper is whether this re-enumeration can compensate for the lack of power-loading. The outcome is that for small precoder codebooks, unitary precoding performs as good as non-unitary, while for larger codebooks non-unitary precoding outperforms unitary precoding.	algorithm;codebook;enumerated type;mimo;set packing;simulation	Dzevdan Kapetanovic;Fredrik Rusek	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683393	bit error rate;telecommunications;gain;computer science;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;feedback;mathematics;cluster analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;precoding;measurement;statistics;mimo	EDA	42.26187336453536	73.2462767773711	171938

We design layered LDPC convolutional codes for this problem, assuming that one of the sources is available at the common decoder as side information. We demonstrate that layered LDPC convolutional codes constitute a sequence of nested codes where each sub-code is capacity-achieving for the binary symmetric channels used to model the correlation between sources, and therefore, can ideally achieve the theoretical minimum sum-rate. Simulated performance results for moderate block length show a small gap to the theoretical limit, and as the block length increases the gap vanishes.	adversary (cryptography);block code;convolutional code;l (complexity);low-density parity-check code;megabyte;numerical method	Farshad Naghibi;Ragnar Thobaben;Somayeh Salimi;Mikael Skoglund	2012	2012 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications		block code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;combinatorics;convolutional code;low-density parity-check code;telecommunications;sequential decoding;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;tornado code;linear code;mathematics;forward error correction;raptor code;error floor;communications system	Theory	39.356790272844286	64.93350712398319	172210

The original generating method of this class of codes restricts the length (or period) of the codewords to the set {2, 4, 16, 256, 65536}. In this paper we use an alternative generation method based on the algebraic properties of Zech logarithms that allow us to generalize the construction in a systematic manner and improving the codeword length choices, code size and minimum distance. The performance of these generalized codewords are then evaluated using both AWGN and Rayleigh communication channels and qualitatively compared with the originally extended TCH codewords.	additive white gaussian noise;code rate;code word;computer programming;cyclic code;discrete logarithm;extended memory;level of detail;linear algebra;msat;nonlinear system;programmer;rayleigh–ritz method;ultra-wideband	A.

We compare the performance of best lattice constellations with those optimized without any constraint on their structure. Even though the lattice based constellations provide the best minimum distance, usually they do not allow for a good binary labelling. Therefore, in more realistic system scenarios, up to a 2 dB gain can be obtained by properly optimizing the constellation and the corresponding binary labelling. We also investigate the performance of 4D constellations obtained by the Cartesian product of two 2D constellations.	cartesian closed category;decibel	Farbod Kayhan;Nicolò Mazzali;Shankar Mysore Rama R.

Due to the mobility of communicator, wireless communication channels are time variant. The uncertainties in the time-varying channel's coefficients cause the amplitude distortion as well as the phase distortion of the M-QAM modulation signals. On the other hand, the Probabilistic Tangent Subspace method is designed to encode the pattern variations. Therefore, we are motivated to adopt this method to develop a classifier as an equalizer for time-varying channels. Simulation results show that this equalizer performs better than those based on nearest neighbor method and support vector machine method for Rayleigh fading channels.	multipath propagation	Jing Yang;Yunpeng Xu;Hongxing Zou	2005		10.1007/11538356_98	nearest neighbour algorithm;support vector machine;equalizer;speech recognition;systems modeling;equalization;uncertainty;telecommunications;biological classification;amplitude modulation;computer science;rayleigh fading;machine learning;reuse;mobile computing;wireless;statistics	ML	49.7322234561113	73.15521783477027	172458

All the known low ML decoding complexity techniques utilize the same approach of exploiting either the multigroup decodable or the fast-decodable (conditionally multigroup decodable) structure of a code. We refer to this well known technique of decoding STBCs as Conditional ML (CML) decoding. In [1], we introduced a framework to construct ML decoders for STBCs based on the Generalized Distributive Law (GDL) and the Factor-graph based Sum-Product Algorithm, and showed that for two specific families of STBCs, the Toepltiz codes and the Overlapped Alamouti Codes (OACs), the GDL based ML decoders have strictly less complexity than the CML decoders. In this paper, we introduce a `traceback' step to the GDL decoding algorithm of STBCs, which enables roughly 4 times reduction in the complexity of the GDL decoders proposed in [1]. Utilizing this complexity reduction from `traceback', we then show that for any STBC (not just the Toeplitz and Overlapped Alamouti Codes), the GDL decoding complexity is strictly less than the CML decoding complexity. For instance, for any STBC obtained from Cyclic Division Algebras that is not multigroup or conditionally multigroup decodable, the GDL decoder provides approximately 12 times reduction in complexity compared to the CML decoder. Similarly, for the Golden code, which is conditionally multigroup decodable, the GDL decoder is only about half as complex as the CML decoder.	belief propagation;code (cryptography);decoding methods;factor graph;generalized distributive law;reduction (complexity);toeplitz hash algorithm	Natarajan Lakshmi Prasad;K.

We develop a soft-decision-driven sequential algorithm geared to the pipelined turbo equalizer architecture operating on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols. One interesting feature of the pipelined turbo equalizer is that multiple soft-decisions become available at various processing stages. A tricky issue is that these multiple decisions from different pipeline stages have varying levels of reliability. This paper establishes an effective strategy for the channel estimator to track the target channel, while dealing with observation sets with different qualities. The resulting algorithm is basically a linear sequential estimation algorithm and, as such, is Kalman-based in nature. The main difference here, however, is that the proposed algorithm employs puncturing on observation samples to effectively deal with the inherent correlation among the multiple demapper/decoder module outputs that cannot easily be removed by the traditional innovations approach. The proposed algorithm continuously monitors the quality of the feedback decisions and incorporates it in the channel estimation process. The proposed channel estimation scheme shows clear performance advantages relative to existing channel estimation techniques.	channel state information;exit chart;equalization (communications);frequency divider;kalman filter;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;propagation of uncertainty;puncturing;scheme;sequential algorithm;simulation;software propagation;turbo equalizer	Daejung Yoon;Jaekyun Moon	2011	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2011.061511.100238	turbo equalizer;electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	46.67280547694874	71.677945812367	172811

A convenient trade-off between diversity and multiplexing gain is achieved by multi-user Orthogonal Space-Time Block Coding (OSTBC): an independent space-time code is employed on each user link, while multiple users are spatially multiplexed for additional capacity. This paper addresses the optimization of multi-user OSTBC systems where the receiver is provided with multiple antennas. The study explicitly addresses both ideal Maximum Likelihood receivers and linear Zero-Forcing receivers in a general setting that is able to model, e.g., a Multiple Access Channel with uncorrelated receive antennas. Assuming K scheduled users, it is shown that system performance optimization can be decoupled into K simpler independent convex optimization problems that are conveniently solved in a distributed fashion.	convex function;convex optimization;discrete cosine transform;elementary function;mathematical optimization;multi-user mimo;profiling (computer programming);spatial multiplexing;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Stefano Sorrentino	2009	VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073799	zero forcing equalizer;block code;covariance matrix;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;convex optimization;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;channel code;telecommunications;antenna;mathematics;interference;maximum likelihood;space technology;radio receiver;space–time code;correlation;spatial multiplexing;channel capacity;statistics;mimo	Mobile	40.85897617838266	73.30793211278842	172851

We consider robustness within and among families of channels with the same singular values (SV’s). When the two SV’s are similar, bit error rate performance is robust in terms of proximity to the channel capacity. When the 2 SV’s differ significantly, robust performance can be achieved by a time-varying linear transformation (TVLT). Iterative decoding is the same as for standard parallel concatenated convolutional codes, except that the extrinsic information about encoder outputs are also exchanged.	bit error rate;channel capacity;concatenation;convolutional code;encoder;interference (communication);mimo;mutual information;rayleigh fading;singular value decomposition;systemverilog;turbo code;x.690	Wei Shi;Christos Komninakis;Richard D.

The resulting suboptimality may be tempered via appropriate scaling of the LLRs, e.g., the fixed optimal scaling in the normalized min-sum algorithm, and variable scaling algorithms gradually appearing in the literature. However, up to now, none of the papers studied variable scaling both as per iteration and as per different check node degree, due to the prohibitive complexity of multioptimization over space of too many parameters. In this paper, we propose a generalized mutual information (GMI) of LLRs as the criterion to search for the scaling factors for different check node degrees in every iteration in a 1-D thus low-complexity manner. This approach is first analyzed via density evolution, and in addition can be extended to practical LLRs based formulas via Monte Carlo tools to cope with the mismatch issue. Bit error rate simulation results on two low-density parity-check codes show that our proposed GMI metrics have a noticeable gain over the variable scaling schemes that appeared in the literature.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;approximation;backpropagation;belief propagation;bit error rate;caller id;enumerator polynomial;global microbial identifier;greedy algorithm;imax;image scaling;iteration;level of detail;liu hui's π algorithm;low-density parity-check code;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;monte carlo method;mutual information;no man's sky;nonlinear system;order management system;portable document format;simulation;software propagation;x.690	Yin Xu;Leszek Szczecinski;Bo Rong;Fabrice Labeau;Dazhi He;Yiyan Wu;Wenjun Zhang	2014	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2014.2364532	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;bit error rate;sequential decoding;theoretical computer science;mathematics;mutual information;error floor;statistics;monte carlo method	ML	41.331065507726244	62.31070048903715	172953

3fb7257150c9c824b2dbba2e4fd124b2d99261c9	a novel coding scheme for encoding and iterative soft-decision decoding of binary bch codes of prime lengths		A novel coding scheme is presented for encoding and iterative soft-decision decoding of binary BCH codes of prime lengths. The encoding of such a BCH code is performed on a collection of codewords which are mapped through Galois Fourier transform into a codeword of a nonbinary low-density parity-check (LDPC) code which has a binary parity-check matrix for transmission. Using this matrix, a binary iterative soft-decision decoding algorithm based on belief-propagation is applied to jointly decode a collection of codewords of the BCH code. The joint-decoding allows information sharing among the received vectors corresponding to the codewords in the collection during the iterative decoding process. For decoding a BCH code of prime length, the proposed decoding scheme not only requires low decoding complexity, but also yields superior performance. The proposed decoding scheme can achieve a joint-decoding gain over the maximum likelihood decoding of individual codewords.	algorithm;bch code;belief propagation;code word;decoding methods;encoder;flash memory;forward error correction;iteration;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;majority logic decoding;parity-check matrix;scheme;soft-decision decoder;software propagation	Shu Lin;Khaled A.

Due to the limited bandwidth, sensor nodes quantize their noisy observations before transmission to a fusion center (FC) for the estimation process. In this letter, the correlation between observations is exploited to reduce the mean-square error (MSE) of the distributed estimation. Specifically, sensor nodes generate local predictions of their observations and then transmit the quantized prediction errors (innovations) to the FC rather than the quantized observations. The analytic and numerical results show that transmitting the innovations rather than the observations mitigates the effect of quantization noise and hence reduces the MSE.	image noise;mean squared error;numerical analysis;quantization (signal processing);sensor node;transmitter	Taha Bouchoucha;Mohammed F.

Their orthogonal structure also leads to simpler decoding algorithms. We consider a $4\times2$ system with multiplexed Alamouti codes. An exhaustive search maximum likelihood (ML) decoding for a $4 \times 2$ system is of order $M^4$, for a modulation scheme with constellation size $M$. For multiplexed orthogonal designs, an exact fast ML decoding algorithm has recently been reported whose complexity order is $M^2$ for a $4 \times 2$ system with QAM constellations. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity of this fast ML algorithm may still be infeasible in practice for large constellations (e.g. $M \geq$ 64 QAM). In this paper, we present a method for designing low complexity sub-optimal decoders based on a combination of search based ML decoding and linear decoding. Our formulation facilitates a direct investigation of the trade-off between performance and complexity. The complexity of our hybrid decoder is flexible and it can be fixed based on the desired performance for a hardware implementation. Although extendable to more general multiplexed Alamouti systems, we focus here on a $4\times2$ space-time-polarization system comprising of two dual-polarized transmit antennas and one dual-polarized receive antenna.	algorithm;brute-force search;code;complexity;decoding methods;extensibility;mimo;modulation;multiplexing;polarization (waves);requirement;systems design	Linda M.

A signal received on a fading channel is subject to a multiplicative distortion (MD) and to the usual additive noise. Following a compensation of the MD, the signal provided to the detector may be thought to include only a single additive distortion term (""""final noise""""), which comprises the effects of the original additive noise, the MD, and the error in MD compensation. An exact expression for the probability density function of the final noise is derived. This allows calculation of error probability for arbitrary types of linear modulations. Results for many cases of interest are presented. Furthermore, as special cases of Ricean fading, error probability for Rayleigh fading and non-fading channels are obtained which either match the results or complete the approximate derivations formerly known from the literature. >"""	additive white gaussian noise;modulation;rayleigh–ritz method	Mahrokh G.

14b5bb46c42027bb0e7d192a0750c98c0cabff84	an experimental comparison of coded modulation strategies for 100 gb/s transceivers	iterative decoding;decoding;phase shift keying;receivers;forward error correction	Coded modulation is a key technique to increase the spectral efficiency of coherent optical communication systems. Two popular strategies for coded modulation are turbo trellis-coded modulation (TTCM) and bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) based on low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Although BICM LDPC is suboptimal, its simplicity makes it very popular in practice. In this work, we compare the performance of TTCM and BICM LDPC using information-theoretic measures. Our information-theoretic results show that for the same overhead and modulation format only a very small penalty (less than 0.1 dB) is to be expected when an ideal BICM LDPC scheme is used. However, the results obtained for the coded modulation schemes implemented in this paper show that the TTCM outperforms BICM LDPC by a larger margin. For a 1000 km transmission at 100 Gb/s, the observed gain was 0.4 dB.	coherence (physics);gigabyte;information theory;low-density parity-check code;modulation;overhead (computing);spectral efficiency;transceiver;trellis quantization	Eric Sillekens;Alex Alvarado;Chigo Okonkwo;Benn C.

The TI-LS iteratively finds two steering matrices associated with the transmit and receive arrays, and the target's bearing can be easily obtained based on prior knowledge of the transmit and receive array manifolds. Furthermore, by jointly using the information from the transmit and receive array responses, angular estimation accuracy can be significantly improved. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the excellent angular estimation accuracy and computational efficiency of this new method.	iterative method;mimo;triangular function	Hui Lv;Da-Zheng Feng;Hongwei Liu;Jie He;Cong Xiang	2009	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2009.05.011	computer simulation;electronic engineering;telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;least squares;statistics	Networks	53.331412531700586	74.32925150295557	175716

Iterative multiuser receiver algorithms mitigate these signal impairments, while offering a good tradeoff between performance and complexity. The receiver presented in this paper performs channel estimation, multiuser detection and decoding in an iterative manner. The estimation of the frequency selective, block-fading channel is initiated with the pilot symbols. In subsequent iterations, soft decisions of all the data symbols are used in an appropriate way to improve the channel estimates. This approach leads to significant improvement of the overall receiver performance, compared to other schemes. The bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the receiver is evaluated by simulations for different parameter setups.

In order to improve system performance, the SD is usually combined with the error correction codes where soft decoding is utilized. The list sphere decoder (LSD) was introduced to generate a candidate list, which can provide soft information to the outer decoder. Unlike the conventional sphere decoder, the LSD has the candidate list updating and new radius generation units, which causes extra complexity and latency. In this paper, we present a novel radius updating architecture, which can obtain a new radius much faster than the conventional method. Furthermore, we propose an efficient candidate list updating scheme, which can significantly save the complexity (without affecting the decoding speed) of updating the candidate list used to compute soft information.	boolean algebra;clock signal;code;critical path method;decoding methods;ecc memory;error detection and correction;insertion sort;mimo;merge sort	Qingwei Li;Zhongfeng Wang;Xingcheng Liu	2008	APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746216	list update problem;electronic engineering;real-time computing;error detection and correction;soft-decision decoder;computer science;theoretical computer science;self-organizing list;lattice;computer performance;maximum likelihood;statistics;mimo	Robotics	45.71587008684493	64.33356924469724	176190

In traditional bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) schemes and its iterative version, BICM-ID, each bit node is mapped into one single symbol, but in our new BEICM-ID scheme some bit nodes may map into multi symbols, thus diversity is achieved, and since iterative decoding and demapping is used, more mutual information will exchange among bit nodes, check nodes and symbol nodes which may further improve the total error correcting ability. Compared to the BICM and BICM-ID schemes, the proposed coded modulation scheme can achieve a performance gain with different modulation types under Rayleigh fading channels, with 256qam modulation the gain over BICM is about 1.5dB and the gain over BICM-ID is about 0.75dB.	ampersand;iteration;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;modulation;mutual information;rayleigh fading;simulation	Jintao Li;Yibin Yang;Huiye Qiu;Yunfeng Guan	2012	2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542928	electronic engineering;quadrature amplitude modulation;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;pulse-position modulation	Mobile	43.46410653256865	69.13240737416619	176851

dfd9a35190a38ad92518074a05e5f8752e5d111d	entanglement-assisted classical communication over quantum channels for binary markov sources		Symbol-based iterative decoding is proposed for the transmission of classical Markov source signals over a quantum channel using a three-stage serial concatenation of a convolutional code (CC), a unity-rate code and a two-qubit superdense (SD) protocol. A modified symbol-based maximum a posteriori algorithm is employed for CC decoding to exploit the Markov source statistics during the iterative decoding process. Extrinsic information transfer chart analysis is performed to evaluate the benefit of the extrinsic mutual information gleaned from the CC decoder for sources with different correlations. We evaluate the bit error rate performance of the proposed coding scheme and compare it with the relevant benchmark schemes, including the turbo coding-based SD scheme. We demonstrate that a near-capacity performance can be achieved using the proposed scheme and when utilizing sources having a high correlation coefficient of $\rho =0.9$, the proposed coding scheme performs within 0.53 dB from the entanglement-assisted classical capacity.

Nonlinear transition shift (NLTS) arising from previously written transitions is one of these. The signal distortion induced by NLTS is reduced by use of write precompensation during data recording. In this paper, we numerically evaluate the effect of NLTS on the read-back signal by using the model proposed by Bertram and Nakamoto. By means of computer simulation, we examine the effectiveness of two write precompensation schemes in combating NLTS effects in a channel characterized by both transition jitter noise and additive white Gaussian electronics noise. We numerically optimize the precompensation schemes according to channel bit-error-rate, as well as more computationally tractable criteria. Our results suggest that a write-precompensation technique with as few as two adjustable parameters can be very effective against NLTS effects.	bit error rate;cobham's thesis;computer simulation;consortium;distortion;magnetic storage;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;perpendicular recording;read-write memory;uc browser;utility functions on indivisible goods;write precompensation;x.690;on-line system	Zheng Wu;H.

Analog processing enables the analog-digital converter to be excluded from the decoder realization. Moreover, high-speed operation can be achieved via differential processing. We describe the differential operation, together with the resulting decoder structure. The differential architecture enables the trace-back memory to be excluded and makes online decoding after initial transitional stages possible. We analyze the performance of the differential analog decoder by including analog circuit nonidealities in the system-level model. The decoder obeys a nonlinear transfer function, and the monotonical growth of path metrics is avoided by scaling and subtraction of the global minimum. The resulting differential analog decoder performance is compared with the performance of a 3-bit soft-decision digital Viterbi decoder.

By re-optimizing the quantizer at progressively lower levels of assumed channel noise, the design is less susceptible to poor local optima. The method is applied to: 1) channel-optimized VQ design; and 2) index assignment for a source-optimized VQ. For both problems, we demonstrate substantial performance improvements over commonly used techniques.	linear programming relaxation;local optimum;noise (electronics);noisy-channel coding theorem;quantization (signal processing);vector quantization	Shrinivas Gadkari;Kenneth Rose	1999	IEEE Trans.

The latter applies algebraic network coding to the source codewords and forwards only the additional redundancy to the destination that observes a product code matrix built based on source codewords and relay-generated redundancy. However, for such an application two types of correlation can be found between the different sensors' observations. The first type is due to the high density of the WSN that results in a correlation between observations delivered by neighbor sensors (spatial correlation). The nature of the measured physical phenomena induces also some correlation between successive observations of the same sensor (temporal correlation). Such correlations represent extra source information that was neglected in previous contributions dealing with cooperative communications. In this contribution, we investigate a joint source channel decoding scheme that exploits the source memory structure to improve the product code iterative decoding performance. Significant performance improvements are demonstrated depending on the spatial and temporal correlation level. A performance gain achieving 0.8 dB for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, and 1.5 dB for the fast Rayleigh fading channel are demonstrated.	additive white gaussian noise;channel (communications);code word;cooperative mimo;ibm tivoli storage productivity center;iterative method;linear algebra;linear network coding;mega man network transmission;rtfm;rayleigh fading;relay;sensor;shortest path problem;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation interoperability standards organization;universal product code;utility functions on indivisible goods	Amin Zribi;Ramesh Pyndiah	2014	2014 8th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)	10.1109/ISTC.2014.6955123	electronic engineering;telecommunications;variable-length code;computer science;theoretical computer science;decoding methods	Mobile	41.43572916206141	71.39228153929214	177710
1c38818f632620d46d8f21e7bf4e74c1c9674896	de-randomizing shannon: the design and analysis of a capacity-achieving rateless code		This paper presents an analysis of spinal codes, a class of rateless codes proposed recently [17]. We prove that spinal codes achieve Shannon capacity for the binary symmetric channel (BSC) and the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with an efficient polynomial-time encoder and decoder. They are the first rateless codes with proofs of these properties for BSC and AWGN. The key idea in the spinal code is the sequential application of a hash function over the message bits. The sequential structure of the code turns out to be crucial for efficient decoding. Moreover, counter to the wisdom of having an expander structure in good codes [21], we show that the spinal code, despite its sequential structure, achieves capacity. The pseudo-randomness provided by a hash function suffices for this purpose. Our proof introduces a variant of Gallager’s result characterizing the error exponent of random codes for any memoryless channel [10, Chapters 5, 7]. We present a novel application of these errorexponent results within the framework of an efficient sequential code. The application of a hash function over the message bits provides a methodical and effective way to de-randomize Shannon’s random codebook construction [19]. ∗HB, PI, and JP are affiliated with CSAIL; DS is affiliated with LIDS. ar X iv :1 20 6. 04 18 v1 [ cs .I T ] 3 J un 2 01 2	additive white gaussian noise;binary symmetric channel;channel capacity;code;codebook;encoder;error exponent;hash function;linux intrusion detection system;polynomial;pseudorandomness;randomness;shannon (unit);shannon capacity of a graph;time complexity;utility functions on indivisible goods	Hari Balakrishnan;Peter Iannucci;Jonathan Perry;Devavrat Shah	2012	CoRR		block code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;low-density parity-check code;error detection and correction;online codes;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;repetition code;linear code;expander code;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	39.905754592568144	64.46178245701556	177892

In this system, a user station can transmit a packet asynchronously and randomly, and so the packet birth/death event is one of the most important problems for multiuser detection. We have proposed the CDMA unslotted ALOHA system using an adaptive filter receiver based on minimum mean square error criterion in [8], and shown the improvement in the throughput performance even considering the effect of birth/death event. The ensembleaveraged squared error, however, increases at the point of packet birth. In this paper, we employ interleaving and forward error correction (FEC) coding techniques to mitigate the momentary increase in ensemble-averaged squared error. The use of FEC, however, causes the increase in MAI due to redundancy bits of FEC. Moreover, signal power is reduced under the condition that the energy of an information bit is the same. In such cases, whether an adaptive filter can operate effectively or not interests us. We evaluate the system performance and show that the improvement in throughput is achieved with interleaving and FEC techniques.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive filter;connectionless communication;data compression;error detection and correction;forward error correction;intelligence amplification;least mean squares filter;mean squared error;multi-user;network packet;randomness;recursive least squares filter;stationary process;throughput	Hiraku Okada;Takaya Yamazato;Masaaki Katayama	2002		10.1109/PIMRC.2002.1047360	adaptive filter;code division multiple access;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer performance	Mobile	44.55480008711557	74.11244078570252	177964

We got the modulation and coding scheme thresholds with different reliability request and calculated the average spectrum efficiency. So we verified that the adaptive coded modulation system which adopts LDPC codes can have both good error correction performance and the maximum spectrum utilization rate. The system can adjust to channel diversification dynamically and focus on not only reliability but also efficiency request.	adaptive algorithm;diversification (finance);error detection and correction;liu hui's π algorithm;low-density parity-check code;modulation;parity-check matrix;parsing expression grammar;spectral efficiency	Bo Li;Chang Ju;Hongjuan Yang;Gongliang Liu	2015	2015 10th International Conference on Communications and Networking in China (ChinaCom)	10.1109/CHINACOM.2015.7498017	low-density parity-check code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;forward error correction;error floor;statistics	HPC	44.71680264972148	67.8571826044144	178314

The proposed algorithm asymptotically provides the maximum SINR estimate of the signal with the desired code (SDC) by optimally combining desired signals from different paths and canceling strong multiuser access interference (MUAI). A two-dimensional (2-D) matched filter structure is used where not only different temporal samples of the matched filter output are processed but where those from matched filters connected to different antenna are processed as well. In contrast to previously proposed techniques, an exact code synchronization for the SDC is not required. The algorithm presented herein asymptotically provides the arrival time of the multipaths within a bit period and the optimum beamformers for extracting each of them. Space-time filters for combining the fingers across both space and time while canceling the MUAI’s are constructed correspondingly. The instrumental property exploited by this technique is the fact that although the respective spectra of the SDC and MUAI components at the matched filter output are statistically identical, the respective spectra of their squared values differ. A simplified RAKE structure-based receiver is also proposed. The 2-D RAKE receiver considerably decreases the computations but requires a coarse SDC code synchronization. A technique to achieve coarse SDC code synchronization is also proposed.	algorithm;beamforming;computation;interference (communication);matched filter;multi-user;rake;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;smart data compression;time of arrival	Javier Ramos;Michael D.

A general algorithm is proposed for this purpose and applied to one class of coded modulations. Using a frequency-domain interpretation of the Euclidean distance, it is shown that under extreme channel band limitations, the error event that causes the minimum distance is characterized by a spectral null at DC. Numerical results show that for filtered continuous-phase-modulation codes, decreasing the modulation index or smoothing the frequency pulse does not improve the error performance. For some of these modulations, channel filtering can actually improve the minimum distance. Bandpass and low-pass filtering are contrasted. The numerical results are explained by power spectrum considerations. >	code;interference (communication);modulation	Nambi Seshadri;John B. Anderson	1988	IEEE Trans.

To facilitate these operations, a periodic preamble is often placed at the beginning of a packet. CFO estimation has been extensively studied for the case of two-period preambles. In some applications, however, a preamble with more than two periods is available. A typical example is the IEEE802.11a/g wireless local area network system, which features a ten-period preamble. Recently, researchers have proposed a maximum likelihood (ML) CFO estimation method for such systems. This approach first estimates the received preamble using a least squares method and then maximizes the corresponding likelihood function. In addition to the standard calculations, this method requires an extra procedure to solve the roots of a polynomial function, which is disadvantageous for real-world implementations. In this paper, we propose a new ML method to solve the likelihood function directly and thereby perform CFO estimation. Our method can obtain a closed-form ML solution, without the need for the root-finding step. We further extend the proposed method to address the STO estimation problem as well as derive a lower bound on the estimation performance. Our simulations show that while the performance of the proposed method is either equal to or better than the existing method, the computational complexity is lower.	carrier frequency offset;computational complexity theory;estimation theory;frequency divider;kernel density estimation;least squares;multiplexing;network packet;polynomial;root-finding algorithm;simulation;slater-type orbital	Hung-Tao Hsieh;Wen-Rong Wu	2009	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2009.2019820	synchronization;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	EDA	51.118358951442666	73.6787463308704	178515

We design two corresponding frequency offset filters and reanalyze their useful signal part and noise distribution.

This is because the code orthogonality is easily maintained when channel variation across the consecutive blocks, in a block-by-block high-speed transmission, is negligible. The proposed system uses frequency domain equalisation at the receiver to combat multipath interference efficiently over frequency selective fading channels. We propose despreading before equalisation, which reduces the frequency domain process to symbol-wise operation. A cell-specific scrambling code is employed to suppress other-cell interference for uplink transmission in a multicell system.

Furthermore, a symbol decoding of LDPC-BICM is introduced, which directly uses the symbol metric. With the symbol decoding, an LDPC-BICM system can take the advantage of non-Gray constellation mappings. Simulation results are presented to show that the mixed non-Gray and Gray mapped LDPC-BICM with symbol decoding outperforms the conventional single Gray mapped LDPC-BICM with bit decoding by at least 0.2 dB.	ampersand;low-density parity-check code;map;modulation;simulation;trellis quantization	Ba-Zhong Shen;Howard Tran;Kelly Cameron	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Communications (IEEE Cat.

We propose and evaluate a new OW configuration that employs an adaptive beam clustering method (ABCM) in conjunction with diversity detection. Our goal is to reduce the effect of transmitter/receiver mobility and the associated impacts in terms of a weak received optical power and reduction in bandwidth. Previous work has shown that multiple spot diffusing techniques suffer from these two fundamental limitations associated with mobility. Our new ABCM can help overcome the impairments introduced by mobility, introduce gain in the received optical power, and increase bandwidth even at large transmitter and receiver separations. Our results indicate that, at the least successful locations, the ABCM system can reduce the signal delay spread by nearly a factor of twenty and enhance the SNR by almost 15 dB over a line strip multibeam system (LSMS). We also incorporate the concept of relaying into the adaptive line strip multibeam system and prove that this technique can lead to considerable performance improvements.	cluster analysis;elegant degradation;information sciences institute;multipath propagation;noise (electronics);optical wireless;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Fuad E.

From the results of simulations using error pattern data collected in field tests and the comparison of various error-correcting codes under many conditions, it has been determined that the shortened (272, 190) majority-logic decodable difference-set cyclic code is a suitable code for NTSC TV signals. Moreover, the decoding algorithm for this code has been improved in order to increase the error-correction capability and a new LSI with this function has been developed. By using error-correcting codes proposed to date for teletext, it has been difficult to obtain a page error rate (PER) of 10 −1  in many measurement points. However, PERs of less than 10 −2  can be obtained in this system, even when random noise, ghost interference, or waveform distortion are present and bit error rates (BERs) are 10 −2 . This paper also gives PERs according to the error-data collected in field tests and shows that the error-correction capability increased equivalently up to 11 error-bits in a 272-bit by improving the decoding algorithm and the results of indoor and outdoor tests.	datacasting;error detection and correction;forward error correction	Osamu Yamada	1991	Sig.

The authors present a technique for the compensation of nonlinear distortions in the received signal constellation in an all-digital demodulator for rate-3/4 16-state trellis coded (TC) 16-QAM. They show that, by simple modifications to the metric computer in the Viterbi decoder, the optimum operating point of the amplifier can be moved much closer to saturation than in the conventional case, without any need for on-board amplifier linearization. The simulation results demonstrate a BER of 10/sup -5/ with a power saving of roughly 3.5 dB in a typical nonlinear channel, when compared to conventional uncoded 8-PSK. This figure includes all of the impairments produced by increased satellite amplifier OBO and by the presence of the subsystems for symbol timing recovery, carrier phase estimation and automatic gain control. >	nonlinear system;trellis quantization	Riccardo De Gaudenzi;Marco Luise	1995	IEEE Trans.

With nonconstant modulus constellations, the performance of the classical second- and fourth-order moments estimate is known to degrade with increasing SNR. A new non-data-aided estimate is proposed, which makes use of the sixth-order moment of the received data, and which can be tuned for a particular constellation in order to extend the usable range of SNR values.

The authors find that the asymptotic spectral efficiency of the linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) MUD which was proposed and analyzed by Evans and Tse in 2000 is indistinguishable from that of the optimal MUD for small system loads. Our results imply that performance of MUD scarcely improves even if one spends more computational cost than that of the LMMSE MUD, i.e., at most the cube of the number of users, on the above-described conditions.	algorithmic efficiency;channel state information;computation;mud;mean squared error;multi-user;profiling (computer programming);randomness;spectral efficiency	Keigo Takeuchi;Mikko Vehkaperä;Toshiyuki Tanaka;Ralf R.

This architecture calculates the correlation among cyclic prefix (CP) regions to estimate the beginning of the OFDM symbol. The proposed architecture utilizes only one functional unit for this purpose, while the throughput is devised for high data-rate optical OFDM systems. Synthesis results of this architecture proves an area saving of 31% compared to the previous work. Moreover, the performance of the correlation method is significantly improved due to a modification applied in the algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method is very promising for new optical OFDM systems where the number of subcarriers and CP length is usually lower than conventional wireless systems.	algorithm;execution unit;high-throughput computing;modulation;real-time clock;simulation;subcarrier;throughput;very-large-scale integration	Reza Ghanaatian;Mahdi Shabany;Mohammad Sharifkhani	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2014.6865494	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Arch	46.83696698025197	64.54716502095721	180140

The analytical expression for soft noise variance is first derived. Note that in the literature, the exact soft noise variance could only be evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation due to the lack of its analytical form. The derived soft noise variance expression only relies on the transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), without the need to have the knowledge of actual or estimated information bits. With the expression of the soft noise variance, we derive an approximate bit error rate (BER) expression for a parallel relay network employing MIF scheme. The derived soft noise variance and system BER expressions are shown to be in tight match with Monte Carlo simulation results.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;bit error rate;monte carlo method;mutual information;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Md.

Since these short range communication systems require low-cost transceiver structures, the development of appropriate receiver techniques has been a major research topic. Particularly, analogue limiter--discriminator--integrator (LDI) dump filtering techniques have received considerable attention. With the availability of digital signal processing (DSP), the digital implementation of LDI techniques has become increasingly attractive. In order to make LDI receivers more accessible, zero-crossing detection was proposed. First, the authors shall focus on the establishment of an appropriate mathematical discrete-time system model, taking bandlimiting receiver filters into account explicitly. This system model serves as the basis for the development of a multitude of digital zero-crossing detection techniques. Starting from this mathematical discrete-time system model, the authors shall focus on a novel, yet promising, approach to digital zero-crossing detection in the intermediate frequency domain, using irregular sampling instead of the commonly employed regular sampling. The novel detectors shall be termed zero-crossing decorrelation detectors (ZXDDs), because a decorrelating approach will be used. The authors shall present three different variants of the ZXDD. The performance of these ZXDD schemes has been analysed in simulations by the authors and obtained results shall be presented and compared to the performance of known LDI and zero-crossing detection based techniques.

A strong code is built by concatenation of several weak high rate codes which encode differently interleaved versions of the data sequence. The need for multiple interleavers implies a new problem in interleaver design: Multiple interleavers have to be constructed which allow good performance in iterative decoding and are mutually random. Furthermore, for practical reasons, they should be constructed either from a simple equation or by simple permutations of a common mother interleaver in order to minimize the required memory for storage of the permutation pattern. We propose two simple methods for interleaver construction which meet those requirements. Our first proposal is to obtain multiple interleavers by cyclic shifts and self-interleaving from a common mother interleaver. The second proposal uses modified read out processes in intermediate steps during construction of the UMTS turbo code internal interleaver. Particularly the proposed cyclic shifted interleavers are shown to provide superior performance with zigzag codes compared to other interleaving schemes such as congruential interleavers.	concatenation;encode;forward error correction;iterative method;permutation pattern;requirement;turbo code	Gerhard Bauch;Katsutoshi Kusume	2007		10.1145/1280940.1281009	practical reason;turbo code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;algorithm;statistics	DB	42.83516557717518	62.27267111348315	180689

In this paper, we develop and investigate a reduced form of an analytical channel model using measured MIMO channel matrices. We investigate the use of this reduced form on predicting MIMO system performance for a square M-QAM closed loop MIMO system with a BER constraint. We compare the performance of the reduced model against both the full analytical channel model developed by Weichselberger and another popular analytical model known as the Kronecker model. Several different environments are explored to generate a range of coupling matrix performances. It is found that at low to moderate SNRs, the channel may be represented accurately by the new reduced model.	adaptive filter;channel (communications);data compaction;mimo;performance;x.690	Leslie C.

The proposed SECCC scheme is composed of constituent recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) codes and an interleaver is used to randomise the extrinsic information exchanged between the constituent RSC codes. Additionally, a puncturer is used to increase the achievable bandwidth efficiency. At the receiver self-iterative decoding is invoked between the hypothetical decoder components. The performance of the system was evaluated using the H.264/AVC source codec for interactive video telephony. Furthermore, EXIT charts were utilised in order to analyse the convergence behaviour of the SECCC scheme advocated. We demonstrate the efficiency of this approach by showing that the video quality is significantly improved, when using the binary SECCC scheme. More explicitly, the proposed system exhibits an $E_b/N_0$ gain of $6~dB$ at the PSNR degradation point of $2~dB$ in comparison to the identical-rate benchmarker carrying out RSC coding and puncturing, while communicating over correlated Rayleigh fading channels.	alexander horned sphere;channel capacity;codec;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;convolutional code;eb-eye;exit chart;eb/n0;elegant degradation;forward error correction;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;iterative method;modulation;peak signal-to-noise ratio;puncturing;rayleigh fading;recursion;set packing;spectral efficiency;systems design;videotelephony	Nasruminallah;Muhammad Fasih Uddin Butt;Soon Xin Ng;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493657	electronic engineering;convolutional code;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;statistics	Vision	43.17772787734768	67.89884287188514	181032

Even if the channel gain is perfectly known to the receiver, inaccurate estimation of the additive noise power, results in incorrect log-likelihood computation at the receiver and hence significant performance degradation in the decoder. Through a detailed study of the effects of channel estimation errors on the performance of soft-decision iterative decoders in uncorrelated block-fading channels, we propose a solution which does not need a knowledge of the power of the additive noise. We show that this solution performs almost identical to the case for which a perfect knowledge of the power of the additive noise exists at the receiver. The choice of the block-fading channel reflects a situation where the equivalent variance of the additive Gaussian noise can change in a wide range and thus the decoder performance seriously relies on the knowledge of the noise power at the receiver.	additive white gaussian noise;channel state information;computation;elegant degradation;iteration;iterative and incremental development;noise power;utility functions on indivisible goods	Pirouz Zarrinkhat;Masoud Ardakani;Raman Yazdani	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.171	gaussian noise;telecommunications;computer science;wireless;statistics	EDA	47.18012793406026	74.16629148857962	181164

The LLR is obtained based on an enhanced estimate of the variance of the multiple- access interference (MAI) and residual MAI (RMAI) plus noise. The (R)MAI terms are modeled as conditionally Gaussian with a time-dependent variance that is a function of the user cross-correlations and fading coefficients. Significant performance gains due to the improved LLR's are realized over PPIC schemes using fixed variance estimates in frequency non-selective Rayleigh fading channels. The performance gap is greater when two stages of the improved PPIC are used. Reduced complexity forms of the variance estimates and LLR's are proposed and also shown to give a performance advantage.	carrier recovery;coefficient;coherence (physics);computation;cross-correlation;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);lucas–lehmer–riesel test;multi-user;multistage amplifier;nonlinear system;programming computable functions;rayleigh fading;synthetic genetic array;viterbi algorithm	Ayman Elezabi	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.702	turbo code;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;fading;statistics	Robotics	44.79250986061636	74.03858916893664	181266

First of all, we investigate the outage probability and the outage-based power loss of the MIMO-ISI ARQ channel when optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) turbo packet combining is used at the receiver. We show that the ARQ delay (i.e., the maximum number of ARQ rounds) does not completely translate into a diversity gain. We then introduce two efficient turbo packet combining algorithms that are inspired by minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based turbo equalization techniques. Both schemes can be viewed as low-complexity versions of the optimal MAP turbo combiner. The first scheme is called signal-level turbo combining and performs packet combining and multiple transmission ISI cancellation jointly at the signal-level. The second scheme, called symbol-level turbo combining, allows ARQ rounds to be separately turbo equalized, while combining is performed at the filter output. We conduct a complexity analysis where we demonstrate that both algorithms have almost the same computational cost as the conventional log-likelihood ratio (LLR)-level combiner. Simulation results show that both proposed techniques outperform LLR-level combining, while for some representative MIMO configurations, signal-level combining has better ISI cancellation capability and achievable diversity order than that of symbol-level combining.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;analysis of algorithms;automatic repeat request;catastrophic interference;computation;diplexer;downtime;information sciences institute;interference (communication);lucas–lehmer–riesel test;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;network packet;power dividers and directional couplers;simulation;symbol level;turbo equalizer	Tarik Ait-Idir;Samir Saoudi	2009	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2009.12.080318	minimum mean square error;turbo equalizer;communications protocol;algorithm design;turbo code;hybrid automatic repeat request;logarithm;electronic engineering;equalization;selective repeat arq;telecommunications;likelihood-ratio test;computer science;signal processing;noise reduction;control theory;mathematics;mean squared error;maximum likelihood;computational complexity theory;automatic repeat request;fading;intersymbol interference;statistics;diversity gain;mimo	Mobile	46.61459534697778	72.68739549544995	181658

However, at medium to high signal-to-noise ratios, an observable error floor arises from the loss of independence of messages passed under iterative graph-based decoding. In this paper, the error floor performance of the short block length codes is improved by the use of a novel candidate selection metric in code graph construction. The proposed multipath extrinsic message degree (EMD) approach avoids harmful structures in the graph by evaluating certain properties of the cycles introduced in each edge placement. We present multipath EMD-based designs for several structured LDPC codes, including quasi-cyclic and the irregular repeat accumulate codes. In addition, an extended class of the diversity-achieving codes on the challenging block fading channel is proposed and considered with the multipath EMD design. This combined approach is demonstrated to provide the gains in decoder convergence and error rate performance. A simulation study evaluates the performance of the proposed and existing state-of-the-art methods.	bit error rate;block code;error floor;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;multipath propagation;observable;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Cornelius T.

The second realization results in a lowest critical period equal to one multiply operation time and a higher throughput. Unlike the existing architectures the adaptation delay of this design is independent of the filter length and has a higher speedup.

9ddf1534811adee6028958737e96687c57be95d7	an area-efficient on-chip memory system for massive mimo using channel data compression		Massive multiple–input-multiple–output has proven to deliver improvements in both spectral and transmitted energy efficiency. However, these improvements come at the cost of critical design challenges for the hardware implementation due to the huge amount of data that has to be processed immediately, especially the storage of large channel state information (CSI) matrices. This paper presents an on-chip memory system equipped with CSI which provides high area efficiency, while supporting flexible accesses and high bandwidths. Optimization across system-algorithm-hardware is used to develop hardware-friendly compression algorithms exploring propagation characteristics and large antenna-array features. More specifically, group-based and spatial-angular transform algorithms are implemented in a heterogeneous memory system, which consists of an unified memory for storing compressed CSI and a parallel memory for flexible access. Up to 75% memory can be saved for a 128-antenna system, at a less than 0.8dB performance loss. Implemented in ST 28nm FD-SOI technology, the capacity of designed system is 1.06Mb, which is equivalent to 4Mb uncompressed memory and can store 100  $128\times 10$  channel matrices. The area is 0.47 mm2, demonstrating a 58% reduction compared with a memory system without CSI compression. With a supply voltage of 1.0V, the memory system can run at 833 MHz, providing a 833Gb/s access bandwidth.

On the other hand, this will he the case when recently standardized synchronous networks as SONET will coexist with signals coming from existing networks, where small variations are tolerated in frequencies only nominally identical. A possible solution to the problem is furnished by a pulse stutling technique in which both positive and negative stuffings are allowed with two stuffing thresholds periodically modulated by a sawtooth waveform. The paper gives a suitable mathematical model of this technique and a frequency domain analysis of the inherent pulse stuffing jitter. In particular, it is shown that the considered approach reduces the peak-to-peak pulse stuffingjitter according to the inverse of the threshold modulation period. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations.	coexist (image);computer simulation;domain analysis;mathematical model;modulation;multiplexing;numerical analysis;sawtooth (cellular automaton);synchronizer (algorithm);synchronous optical networking	Gianfranco L.

The problem of estimating such second order statistics of MIMO channels, based on limited amounts of training data, is treated in this article. It is assumed that the Kronecker model holds. This implies that the channel covariance is the Kronecker product of one covariance matrix that is associated with the array and the scattering at the transmitter and one that is associated with the receive array and the scattering at the receiver. The proposed estimator uses training data from a number of signal blocks (received during independent fades of the MIMO channel) to compute the estimate. This is in contrast to methods that assume that the channel realizations are directly available, or possible to estimate almost without error. It is also demonstrated how methods that make use of the training data indirectly via channel estimates can be biased. An estimator is derived that can, in an asymptotically optimal way, use, not only the structure implied by the Kronecker assumption, but also linear structure on the transmit- and receive covariance matrices. The performance of the proposed estimator is analyzed and numerical simulations illustrate the results and also provide insight into the small sample behaviour of the proposed method.	mimo	Karl Werner;Magnus Jansson	2009	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2008.06.014	covariance matrix;transmitter;electronic engineering;order statistic;telecommunications;computer science;covariance;signal processing;mathematics;kronecker product;estimation theory;antenna array;second-order logic;communications system;statistics;data transmission	Vision	50.359635788798634	71.33867590043567	182231

To further increase data rates and coding gain, higher rate codes with more states can be used. Cost effectiveness of decoders for these complex rate-k/n and trellis codes becomes a major issue. While cost-effective decoder architectures for rate-1/n convolutional codes and high speed decoder architectures are well know, current low-cost decoders for rate-k/n convolutional and trellis codes still resort to suboptimal decoding algorithms. This paper describes a new way to design cost-effective Viterbi decoders for complex rate-k/n convolutional and trellis codes through a co-design of state-processor mapping, topology scaling, scheduling, metric reordering, and VLSI structures of processing elements. New serial-access processing element structures are proposed. The 2q-way interleaving algorithms developed here for metric reordering can be applied to other applications such as interleave coding.	binary decoder;code (cryptography);coding gain;convolutional code;forward error correction;image scaling;satellite radio;scheduling (computing);sequential access;spectral efficiency;terrestrial television;trellis quantization;very-large-scale integration;viterbi algorithm	Horng-Dar Lin	1994		10.1007/3-540-57856-0_48	turbo code;soft output viterbi algorithm;convolutional code;cost-effectiveness analysis;sequential decoding;space–time trellis code;viterbi algorithm;computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;coding gain;linear code;error floor;viterbi decoder;iterative viterbi decoding;statistics	ML	44.68192360339743	62.84630102821985	182404

Given the difficulty of implementing chemical bandwidth, molecular communications has a limited data rate. In this letter, we propose and implement passband modulation by precisely controlling the longitudinal wave properties of molecules, effectively creating distinguishable carrier waves. This is achieved through a simple oscillation of the transmitter. Molecular frequency division multiplexing is achieved and we demonstrate that different molecular information streams can co-exist in the same space and time channel, creating bandwidth for MCvD.	baseband;best, worst and average case;broadcast delay;carrier wave;data rate units;frequency divider;image scaling;line code;multiplexing;performance;single-sideband modulation;transmitter;transverse wave;uncompressed video;x.690	Weisi Guo;Bin Li;Siyi Wang;Wei Liu	2015	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2448098	transmitter;pulse-amplitude modulation;telecommunications;computer science;baseband;band-pass filter;passband;bandwidth;modulation	Networks	53.57659923849314	67.88690781375635	182405

The first scheme consists of permuting coordinates of multidimensional modulation and trellis coded modulation (TCM) on interleaved channels. Theoretical and simulation results show that this simple permutation may provide gains of 3.8 dB on slow Rayleigh fading channels for uncoded modulation. It also improves by 5 dB the performance of fully interleaved 16-QAM TCM. The second scheme consists of using coded frequency diversity. Without bandwidth expansion, the signal is spread over different independent fading channels. For two very slow fading channels, where interleaving is impractical and coding usually does not provide any gain, coded diversity and 16-QAM TCM provides gains of 13 dB at a BER of	bandwidth expansion;decibel;forward error correction;multidimensional modulation;performance;rayleigh fading;simulation;toolkit for conceptual modeling;trellis quantization;x.690	François Gagnon;David Haccoun	1995	IEEE Trans.

First, the problem of optimal codeword by codeword noncoherent detection is analysed; then, design criteria for optimal space-time block codes are proposed and some novel coding schemes are devised. Simulation results evidence that the proposed schemes can efficiently exploit spatial diversity and that their use can entail a limited energy loss with respect to other solutions available in the technical literature for coherent systems, with the substantial advantage, however, of a simple detection algorithm.	algorithm;code word;coherence (physics);discrete cosine transform;key (cryptography);mimo;modulation;simulation	Fabrizio Pancaldi;Giorgio Matteo Vitetta	2006	2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;telecommunications;parity-check matrix;mathematics;communication	EDA	42.951362073160205	71.40365315596019	182464

By exploiting certain results from linear prediction theory, we generalize the algorithm of Tonget al., which was derived under the assumption of a white transmitted sequence. In particular, we show that all one needs to estimate the channel to within an unitary scaling constant, and thus to find its equalizers, is a) that a standard channel matrix have full column rank, and b) a vector of the input signal and its delays have positive definite lag zero autocorrelation. An algorithm is provided to determine the equalizer under these conditions. We argue that because this algorithm makes explicit use of the input statistics, the equalizers thus obtained should outperform those obtained by other methods that neither require, nor exploit, the knowledge of the input statistics. Simulation results are provided to verify this fact.	algorithm;autocorrelation;blind equalization;emoticon;equalization (communications);image scaling;multi-user;simulation	Roberto López-Valcarce;Soura Dasgupta	2001	IEEE Trans.

Low cross-correlation values between spreading sequences are desired to suppress multiple access interference and to improve bit error performance. An auto-correlation function with a distinct peak enables proper synchronization and suppresses intersymbol interference. However, these requirements contradict each other and a trade-off needs to be established. In this paper, a global two dimensional optimization method is proposed to minimize the out-of-phase average mean-square aperiodic auto-correlation with average mean-square aperiodic cross-correlation being allowed to lie within a fixed region. This approach is applied to design sets of complex spreading sequences. A design example is presented to illustrate the relation between various correlation characteristics. The correlations of the obtained sets are compared with correlations of other known sequences.	global optimization;program optimization	Hai Huyen Dam;Hans-Jürgen Zepernick;Sven Nordholm;Jörgen Nordberg	2005	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-004-5036-8	chip;code division multiple access;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;global optimization	EDA	44.86269968743424	70.38827961406528	183215

These are: (1) the type of post-processing employed at the embedder; (2) the form of demodulation; (3) the criteria used to optimize embedding-detection parameters.

Bit errors in the channel lead to incorrect decoding of a VLC and result in error states for continuous codewords. In this paper first a precise value is found for assessing the ability of a VLC to recover synchronization from the error states. Next a new transformation for converting a code into another of the same efficiency (equivalent transformation) is introduced, and several VLCs with an identical efficiency are compared through estimation of synchronization recovery in order to find an error-resistant VLC. Based on the equivalent transformation, an efficient method for finding an error-resistant VLC with high recovery performance from among multiple VLCs is described. >	variable-length code	Yasuhiro Takishima;Masahiro Wada;Hitomi Murakami	1994	IEEE Trans.

First, by using the factor graph (FG) of the obtained generalized Ungerboeck metric for MOS and sum-product algorithm (SPA) framework, a highly efficient reduced state sequence estimation (RSSE) algorithm is proposed that operates on forward and backward directions and is directly applied to unwhitened channel matched filter (CMF) and code matched filter outputs at symbol rate. The proposed structure, generating the a posteriori probabilities (APP) by bidirectional RSSE recursions, are substantiated with symbol rate bidirectional decision feedback (BDF) based on surviving paths in order to eliminate the post- and pre-cursor inter-symbol interference (ISI) as well as multi code interference (MCI) due to the non-ideal properties of the signaling waveforms and multipath channel. It appears as the unification of Ungerboeck type reduced trellis equalization framework for MOS and achieves near-optimum performance especially for channels with large dispersion. Second, we identify a bias term through an error probability analysis which helps us improve the proposed receiver's performance. Furthermore, a tight approximation for the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed receiver is derived. These analyses lead to significant insight on the selection of system parameters and clearly demonstrate the high performance and efficiency of the proposed scheme by a proper choice of the signaling parameters.	algorithm;approximation;backward differentiation formula;belief propagation;bit error rate;cursor (databases);factor graph;information sciences institute;interference (communication);job control (unix);list of content management frameworks;matched filter;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;multipath propagation;recursion;trellis quantization;unification (computer science);x.690	Gökhan Muzaffer Güvensen;Yalçin Tanik;Ali Özgür Yilmaz	2014	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2014.011114.130714	electronic engineering;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	45.3744094961346	74.21665956190095	183810

Conventional algorithms assume that the noise statistics remain constant over the OFDM frequency band and, thereby, average the instantaneous noise samples to get a single estimate. In reality, noise is often made up of white Gaussian noise, along with correlated colored noise that unevenly affects the OFDM spectrum. This paper proposes a minimum mean square error (MMSE) filtering technique to estimate the noise power that takes into account the variation of the noise statistics across the OFDM subcarrier index, as well as across OFDM symbols. The proposed method provides many local estimates that allow tracking of the variation of noise statistics in frequency and time. The MMSE filter coefficients are obtained from the mean-squared-error expression, which can be calculated using the noise statistics. Evaluation of the performance with computer simulations shows that the proposed method tracks the local statistics of the noise more efficiently than conventional methods.	algorithm;coefficient;colors of noise;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;frequency band;interference (communication);mean squared error;microsoft windows;multiplexing;noise power;signal-to-noise ratio;stationary process;subcarrier	Tevfik Yücek;Hüseyin Arslan	2007	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2007.901883	gradient noise;gaussian noise;noise spectral density;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;value noise;telecommunications;noise temperature;computer science;noise measurement;adaptive system;noise;noise;mathematics;noise figure;statistics;salt-and-pepper noise	Visualization	51.396923984140116	72.25437086492941	183945

A comparison is made between orthogonal frequency division multiplexing/multiple access (OFDM(A)) and two combinations of the orthogonal multicarrier technique and the code-division multiple access (CDMA) technique, i.e., multicarrier CDMA (MC-CDMA), where the spreading is accomplished in the frequency domain, and multicarrier direct-sequence CDMA (MC-DS-CDMA), where the spreading is done in the time domain. We evaluate the effect of small synchronization errors on the BER performance by deriving simple analytical expressions for the BER degradation that are based upon truncated Taylor series expansions. To allow a fair comparison, all considered systems are able to accommodate the same number of users, and each user operates at the same data rate. Under these conditions, we show that all multicarrier systems exhibit the same sensitivity to carrier phase jitter and timing jitter. Further, when the number of carriers is equal to the maximum number of users, the different multicarrier systems also are equally affected by a carrier frequency offset or a clock frequency offset.	carrier frequency offset;clock rate;clock synchronization;elegant degradation;frequency divider;multiplexing;uncompressed video;x.690	Heidi Steendam;Marc Moeneclaey	2004	European Transactions on Telecommunications	10.1002/ett.975	synchronization;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Networks	51.70623349413248	72.6485742166048	184092

We focus our attention on providing capacity analysis of a quantized MISO system over correlated fading channels with sub-optimal and mismatched channel quantizers. Two types of mismatched quantizers are investigated, which include: 1) quantizers designed with simple suboptimal criterion, and 2) quantizers whose codebooks are designed with a mismatched channel covariance matrix. We approach this problem from a source coding perspective by formulating the quantized MISO system as a general vector quantization problem with encoder side information, constrained quantization space and non-mean-squared distortion function. By utilizing the high-resolution distortion analysis of the generalized quantizer, we obtain tight lower bounds of the capacity loss of a quantized MISO system with both optimal and mismatched channel quantizers. Theoretical as well as empirical results reveal significant performance degradation of the mismatched quantizers when compared to the optimal channel quantizers.

MIDA is a hard decision decoder that was initially proposed for decoding of Product codes, by same authors. In this paper same concept is being extended for Multi-level codes. The basic iterative decoder has a huge complexity which is unaffordable for long constituent codes especially when used in real time systems. In MIDA, the idea of Syndrome Decoding is used for search space reduction. Moreover, it is found that complexity reduction factor increases with each iteration. The worst case complexity of MIDA is closed to that of basic algorithm but in average case there is huge reduction in complexity, with negligible performance degradation. Performance of the proposed algorithm is investigated over an OFDM system.

In this paper, we propose a systematic approach for designing space-time trellis codes over flat fading channels with full antenna diversity and good coding advantage. It is suitable for an arbitrary number of transmit antennas with arbitrary signal constellations. The key to this approach is to separate the traditional space-time trellis code design into two parts. It first encodes the information symbols using a one-dimensional (M,1) nonbinary block code, with M being the number of transmit antennas, and then transmits the coded symbols diagonally across the space-time grid. We show that regardless of channel time-selectivity, this new class of space-time codes always achieves a transmit diversity of order M with a minimum number of trellis states and a coding advantage equal to the minimum product distance of the employed block code. Traditional delay diversity codes can be viewed as a special case of this coding scheme in which the repetition block code is employed. To maximize the coding advantage, we introduce an optimal construction of the nonbinary block code for a given modulation scheme. In particular, an efficient suboptimal solution for multilevel phase-shift-keying (PSK) modulation is proposed. Some code examples with 2-6 bits/s/Hz and two to six transmit antennas are provided, and they demonstrate excellent performance via computer simulations. Although it is proposed for flat fading channels, this coding scheme can be easily extended to frequency-selective fading channels.	block code;computer simulation;convolutional code;euclidean distance;key (cryptography);mathematical optimization;modulation;parity bit;pre-shared key;repetition code;search algorithm;selectivity (electronic);trellis quantization	Meixia Tao;Roger S.

Since the symbols (in frequency) are in the constellation set, which is a subset of the entire complex plane, it is possible to detect N symbols from the DFT precoded signal when transmitting M <; N symbols, whereM is not too small. We build our analysis on so-called simple vectors, and show that it is possible to detect in the noise-less case with high probability down to approximately M ≥ N/4 for BPSK and M ≥ N/2 for QPSK. We develop extensions from the noise-less to the noisy case, and propose two different detectors for the AWGN channel. Simulations show that using the two proposed detectors in the AWGN channel, we observe empirically a phase transition at M ≈ N/2 for QPSK. Further, it is shown how down-sampled QPSK signals can achieve the same BER and data rate as 8PSK at a lower signal-to-noise-ratio per information bit.	additive white gaussian noise;decimation (signal processing);discrete fourier transform;sampling (signal processing);sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter;uncompressed video;with high probability;x.690	Tobias Lindstrøm Jensen;Karsten Fyhn Nielsen;Thomas Arildsen;Torben Larsen	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)	10.1109/ISSPIT.2012.6621276	computer vision;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;compressed sensing;precoding;detection theory	Arch	45.99878083256458	70.91877823073172	184945

Hence various benefits of CDA codes such as their ability to achieve full diversity are inherited by CSTSK. We demonstrate that the proposed CDA based DMs are capable of achieving a lower symbol error ratio than the existing DMs generated using the capacity as their optimization objective function for both perfect and imperfect channel estimation.	.cda file;bit error rate;channel state information;code;coherent;key (cryptography);mathematical optimization;modulation;optimization problem;pre-shared key;timeshift	Rakshith Rajashekar;K.

To illustrate the methodology, we explicitly derive the bounds for the 2-bits/s/Hz 16 QAM system. Generalization of this bound to other turbo-coded modulation systems is straightforward. As in the case of the standard union bound for turbo codes, we expect these bounds to be useful for rather large values of signal-tonoise ratios, i.e., signal-to-noise ratios for which the code rate is smaller than the corresponding cutoff rate. The bound is based on “uniform interleaving” just as its counterpart for standard turbo coding. The derived bound provides a tool for comparing coded modulation schemes having different component codes, interleaver lengths, mappings, etc., using maximum-likelihood decoding. It is also useful in studying the effectiveness of various suboptimal decoding algorithms. The bounding technique is also applicable to other coded-modulation schemes such as serially concatenated coded modulation.	algorithm;code rate;concatenation;decoding methods;forward error correction;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;turbo code	Tolga M.

It is observed that for the frame size commonly used in wireless LAN applications, a larger constraint length in turbo eades does not necessarily introduce significant improvement in the BITCM performance in the signal-tc-noise ratio range of interest, and it even leads to performance degradation in some case. An explanation is provided from the viewpoint of weight distribution of turbo codes. Extensive performance evaluation indicates that BITCM with constraint length of four has a good trade off between the performance and complexity for the OFDMbased wireless LAN system.

Recently, diversity embedded multilevel space-time codes for flat-fading channels have been designed from sets of binary matrices with rank distance guarantees over the binary field by mapping them onto quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase-shift keying (PSK) constellations. In this paper, we demonstrate that diversity embedded space-time codes for fading intersymbol interference (ISI) channels can be designed with provable rank distance guarantees. As a corollary, we obtain an asymptotic characterization of the fixed transmit alphabet rate-diversity tradeoff for multiple antenna fading ISI channels. The key idea is to construct and analyze properties of binary matrices with a particular structure (Toeplitz structure) induced by ISI channels.	catastrophic interference;code;embedded system;information sciences institute;interference (communication);key (cryptography);modulation;pre-shared key;provable security;toeplitz hash algorithm	Sanket Dusad;Suhas N.

We focus on the decoding problem, and present a decoder structure that allows the decoding to be based on soft minimum mean square-error estimates of the transmitted bits. The new bit-estimate based decoder provides a structured lower-complexity approximation of optimal decoding for general codebooks, and for so-called linear mapping codebooks, it is shown that its implementation becomes particularly simple. We investigate decoding based on optimal bit-estimates, and on suboptimal estimates of lower computational complexity. We also consider encoder optimization and combined source-channel code design. Numerical simulations demonstrate that bit-estimate based decoding is able to outperform a two-stage decision-based approach implemented using Viterbi sequence detection plus table look-up source decoding. The simulations also show that decoding based on suboptimal bit-estimates performs well, at a considerably lowered complexity.	interference (communication);vector quantization	Mikael O.

Through simulations on realistic IDD systems, we show that the proposed method provides considerable complexity savings while maintaining near-optimal performance.	approximation;computation;iterative method;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;mimo;precomputed radiance transfer;search algorithm;simulation	Jaeseok Lee;Byonghyo Shim	2010	21st Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2010.5671878	list decoding;mathematical optimization;detector;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;optimal control;lattice;mathematics;maximum likelihood;lattice;statistics;mimo;satisfiability;search algorithm	Embedded	45.50089828710172	70.78379608704476	186645

The jammer, previously concentrated in the time-frequency (tf ) plane, is suppressed by removing its t-f signature via a binary mask. The applied binary mask gives rise to odd higher-order central moments of the decision variable d, i.e., introduces a deviation in the probability density function of d, fd (x), from a Gaussian law. Two analytical approximations to fd (x) are proposed, Gaussian approximation (GA) and Hermite-Gaussian approximation (HGA). The HGA takes advantage of the Hermite polynomials and central moments of d thus reducing approximation error introduced by the GA. Analytical expressions for the mean, variance and third central moment of d, when the STFT of the received signal is modified by an arbitrary twodimensional function, are derived and numerically confirmed. The HGA outperforms the GA for various types of monocomponent and multicomponent jammers, which was verified by simulations.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;bit error rate;emoticon;hercules graphics card;hermite polynomials;interference (communication);numerical analysis;polynomial;radio jamming;short-time fourier transform;simulation;software release life cycle	Slobodan Djukanovic;Milos Dakovic;LJubisa Stankovic	2009	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2009.04.032	time–frequency analysis;computer science;calculus;signal processing;mathematics;spread spectrum;algorithm;statistics	ML	52.31488127083958	71.2194811232567	186726

This code also possesses a quasi-orthogonal (QO) property like the conventional Minimum Decoding Complexity QO-STBC (MDC-QO-STBC), leadingg to joint ML detection of only two real symbols. The proposed code is shown to exhibit the identical error performance with the existing MDC-QO-STBC. However, the proposed code has an advantage in transceiver implementation since this code can be modified so that the increase of PAPR occurs on only two transmit antennas, whereas MDC-QO-STBC incurs a PAPR increase on all transmit antennas.

The modification is similar to the approximate min constraint presented by C. Jones et al. (see IEEE Conf. Military Commun., MILCOM 2003, p.157-162, 2003) but differs in hardware implementation to suit a serial architecture. Our main contribution is the proposed architecture that exploits the min constraint to reduce the storage of extrinsic messages which forms the bulk of the hardware. The least reliable bit to check input along with the check sum are the only quantities stored in the decoder. Extrinsic message memory reduction increases with the rate of the code and up to 68% saving is achieved for a rate 9/10 code. Simulation results show that the proposed changes do not degrade the bit error rate performance.	approximation algorithm;belief propagation;bit error rate;checksum;jones calculus;low-density parity-check code;maxima and minima;parity bit;simulation	Abhiram Prabhakar;Krishna Narayanan	2005	Proceedings.

We propose a new methodology to design the degree distribution of the RC-LDPC codes with a lower triangular parity-check matrix, enabling the additional parity bits to be linearly and systematically encoded at the relay. Our proposed methodology introduces the concept of a K-layer doping matrix to represent the structure of a lower triangular parity-check matrix. As a result of our methodology, the asymptotic performance of RC-LDPC codes can be analyzed and predicted using the multi-edge-type density evolution. Then, we derive the soft-re-encoding of the additional parity symbols at the relay using our designed RC-LDPC codes. Moreover, we propose a novel method, which we refer to as soft fading, to compute the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of the received signal at the destination for the SDF protocol. We demonstrate that our proposed soft fading method outperforms the best known method in the literature by up to 0.7 dB in terms of BER performance. Finally, we derive a new bound for the power multiplication factor at the relay, which limits the amount of soft-errors forwarded by the relay to the destination. The BER performance of our new RC-LDPC codes improves significantly once the power multiplication factor at the relay satisfies this bound.	algorithm;degree distribution;doping (semiconductor);duplex (telecommunications);low-density parity-check code;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;multiple edges;parity bit;parity-check matrix;qr code;relay channel;triangular matrix;x.690	Marwan H.

Conventionally, it is assumed that channels are flat-fading and relays are perfectly synchronized at the symbol level. However, due to the delay spread in broadband systems and the distributed nature of relay networks, these assumptions may be violated. Hence, inter-symbol interference (ISI) may appear. This paper proposes a new differential encoding and decoding process for D-DSTC systems with multiple relays over slow frequency-selective fading channels with imperfect synchronization. The proposed method overcomes the ISI caused by frequency-selectivity and is robust against synchronization errors while not requiring any channel information at the relays and destination. Moreover, the maximum possible diversity with a decoding complexity similar to that of the conventional D-DSTC is attained. Simulation results are provided to show the performance of the proposed method in various scenarios.	catastrophic interference;interference (communication);relay;selectivity (electronic);simulation;symbol level	M.

In many practical applications, such information is rapidly outdated and has limited realizable benefits. This note investigates the feasibility of linear fading prediction, applied to noisy channel estimates. The predictions are then used for antenna subset selection for space-time block coding. It is shown, using synthesized and measured channel data, that multidimensional prediction from short channel snapshots is unreliable for dense scattering channels. However, the use of parallel predictors can provide a significant increase in the diversity, and hence performance, achievable with antenna subset selection relative to outdated or no channel information at the transmitter.	mimo;mobile phone;noisy-channel coding theorem;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation interoperability standards organization;transmitter;x.690	Kareem E.

Statistic-based algorithms, such as constant modulus (CM), were widely investigated. One inherent issue with blind algorithms is the phase ambiguity of equalized signals. In this letter, we propose a novel scheme based on CM criterion and take advantage of the asymmetric property in a class of LDPC codes to resolve the phase ambiguity. Specifically, a new formulation with modified CM objective function and relaxed code constraints is presented.	algorithm;blind equalization;embedded system;linear programming relaxation;loss function;low-density parity-check code;modulus of continuity;modulus robot;optimization problem;qr code;sockets direct protocol	Kun Wang	2018	CoRR		discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;open problem;mathematical optimization;modulus;ambiguity;mathematics;statistic;blind equalization	DB	50.77492864457657	65.87964951536266	187153

Our results show that both the magnitude and shape of the sum terms of the intermodulation are quite similar to those of the harmonic distortions of the same order. The difference terms of the intermodulation are much smaller if the subcarrier frequencies are not far apart from one another.	analog signal;channel (communications);intermodulation;lightwave 3d;microwave;multiplexing;optical fiber;subcarrier;total harmonic distortion	Charles S.

In this paper, we propose a superimposed training-based linear dispersion (STLD) transmission scheme, where the transmitted symbols are superposition of the training pilots and the data symbols. The STLD system enjoys simple encoding and efficient suboptimal decoding. Since for noncoherent multiple-input multiple-output systems employing the STLD scheme, analytical expressions of block- or bit-error probabilities do not exist, deterministic optimization methods cannot be used to design the optimal STLD system. We therefore propose to design the optimal STLD systems using simulation-based optimization techniques, together with gradient estimation. Simulation results show that with either maximum-likelihood or suboptimal decoding, the STLD systems obtained by the proposed design algorithm generally outperform the conventional training-based scheme employing space-time codes designed for coherent channels	algorithm;code;coherence (physics);decoding methods;imaginary time;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;simulation-based optimization;stochastic gradient descent;symbol (formal)	Jibing Wang;Xiaodong Wang	2006	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2006.877948	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	EDA	45.323867565678064	72.61159068582471	187544

However, error control coding spanning hundreds or thousands of symbol periods is often used with space-time coding. In this case, slow fading channels significantly degrade performance. In this letter, we show that performance can be significantly improved in slow fading conditions by using reconfigurable antennas. We propose switching the transmit antenna states during transmission so that the error control code experiences several different channel conditions over the transmission period. Hence, it can achieve higher diversity and the superior performance expected of a faster fading channel due to reconfigurable antenna state switching. If we also allow the receiver to select the reconfigurable receive antenna states based on channel energy, then an antenna state selection gain is also achieved.	code;complexity;error detection and correction;file spanning;mimo;reconfigurable computing;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Philippa A.

Polyanskiy showed that feedback identifying the first symbol at which decoding is successful allows capacity to be approached with surprisingly low latency. This paper uses Chen's rate-compatible sphere-packing (RCSP) analysis to study what happens when symbols must be transmitted in packets, as with a traditional hybrid ARQ system, and limited to relatively few (six or fewer) incremental transmissions. Numerical optimizations find the series of progressively growing cumulative block lengths that enable RCSP to approach capacity with the minimum possible latency. RCSP analysis shows that five incremental transmissions are sufficient to achieve 92% of capacity with an average block length of fewer than 101 symbols on the AWGN channel with SNR of 2.0 dB. The RCSP analysis provides a decoding error trajectory that specifies the decoding error rate for each cumulative block length. Though RCSP is an idealization, an example tail-biting convolutional code matches the RCSP decoding error trajectory and achieves 91% of capacity with an average block length of 102 symbols on the AWGN channel with SNR of 2.0 dB. We also show how RCSP analysis can be used in cases where packets have deadlines associated with them (leading to an outage probability).	additive white gaussian noise;block code;convolutional code;downtime;entity–relationship model;feedback;hybrid automatic repeat request;information theory;marginal model;mathematical optimization;requirements analysis;set packing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;throughput	Adam R.

An upper bound on the (decoded) bit error probability is derived. Comparisons to simulation results show that this upper bound is quite tight when the system has a high signal-to-noise ratio or when diversity reception is used. The upper bound involves an infinite series that must be truncated at a point where the remainder can be safely assumed to be small.

A lower bound on the mean squared MAI is referred to as chip-asynchronous version of Welch bound, which depends on chip pulse shapes. Real analysis tells us that a pair of rectangular and sinc functions is one of Fourier transform and its inverse Fourier transform and vice versa. On the other hand, Gaussian pulses have the self-duality property. Gaussian chip pulses sacrifice inter-symbol interference, however, they give smaller mean squared MAI, as well as lower bit error rate, than the conventional Nyquist pulses.	welch's method;x.690	Yutaka Jitsumatsu;Tohru Kohda	2006		10.1007/11863854_31	electronic engineering;telecommunications;calculus;mathematics	Theory	52.0462227171879	71.00919896445298	188224

There are many different types of codes available for two-transmitter antennas, such as cyclotomic space-time block codes, the golden space-time block code, and rotation-based space-time block codes. In this paper, a more general space-time block code design scheme, which is called quadratic space-time block coding, is proposed for the two-transmitter antennas using quadratic field extension. The optimal design of the quadratic space-time block codes in terms of a diversity product criterion is also presented. It is shown that the optimal quadratic space-time block codes designed in this paper do not belong to the existing space-time block code family such as the cyclotomic, golden, and rotation-based space-time block codes. The simulation results demonstrate that the average codeword error rate of the optimal quadratic space-time block code attains about 0.5 dB signal to noise ratio gain over those of the optimal cyclotomic and golden space-time block codes.	block code;code word;full rate;lossless compression;optimal design;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;systemic design;transmitter	Genyuan Wang;Jian-Kang Zhang;Moeness G.

Due to complex memory access and requirement of large storage space, the shuffled MPD is not suitable for hardware implementation especially for high-rate LDPC codes. In this paper, we propose a modified shuffled MPD which can achieve a similar convergence speed but with reduced complexity in memory access and storage space as compared to the conventional shuffled MPD. We implement a rate-5/6 LDPC decoder based on the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;low-density parity-check code;message passing	Yeong-Luh Ueng;Chung-Jay Yang;Chun-Jung Chen	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117900	parallel computing;low-density parity-check code;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;statistics	Arch	44.807085718239385	62.45732407656559	188269

The throughput increases with manageable complexity compared to single space time trellis codes (STTC). But the computational complexity increases with the number of levels in the MLSTTC system. And also the metric calculation is a complex equation which needs more multiply and accumulate operation compared to single STTC. In this paper, reduced complexity decoding algorithm for multilevel space time trellis code is proposed to reduce the decoding delay and computational power required at the receiver. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm gives a BER performance nearer to that of the system with full complexity. Further, the impact of correlation between the antennas in the system is also analysed. The simulation results show that with correlated antennas we could maximise the performance.	algorithm;complex system;computational complexity theory;convolutional code;cross-correlation;mimo;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;single-sideband modulation;throughput;transmitter;trellis quantization;x.690	Kotthireddy Kavitha;H.

Although soft-decision decoding (SDD) of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is an active area of research, the mainstay of optical transport systems is still the iterative hard-decision decoding (HDD) of generalized product codes with algebraic syndrome decoding of the component codes. This is because iterative HDD allows many simplifications and SDD of LDPC codes results in much higher implementation complexity. In this paper, we use analysis and simulation to evaluate tightly-braided block codes with BCH component codes for high-speed optical communication. Simulation of the iterative HDD shows that these codes are competitive with the best schemes based on HDD. Finally, we suggest a specific design that is compatible with the G.709 framing structure and exhibits a coding gain of >9.35 dB at 7% redundancy under iterative HDD with a latency of approximately 1 million bits.	bch code;coding gain;data rate units;decoding methods;error detection and correction;forward error correction;framing (world wide web);hard disk drive;iteration;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;network of cancer genes;overhead (computing);simulation;soft-decision decoder;x.690	Yung-Yih Jian;Henry D.

Correlated fading over subcarriers is assumed. At first, a tight bound on the asymptotic error performance for the general case of precoding over all N subcarriers is derived and used to establish the best achievable asymptotic performance by SSD. It is then shown that precoding over subgroups of at least L subcarriers per group, where L is the number of channel taps, is sufficient to obtain this best asymptotic error performance, while significantly reducing the receiver complexity. The optimal joint subcarrier grouping and rotation matrix design is subsequently determined by solving the Vandermonde linear system.

The former are readily dealt with by employing appropriate error control coding, whereas the latter require multiple transmission lines. The conventional approach is to use one active and several standby channels. However, utilizing all available channels through multiple feeding and implementing active redundant receivers allows instantaneous recovery from line failures. We investigate such receiver structures for a data transmission system based on a double-error correcting BCH-code with underlying Manchester line coding and three parallel data links. Different approaches for implementing majority voting strategies are compared with respect to overall error handling capabilities. As a result we will propose an optimal structure called majority Manchester decoder requiring only moderate implementation overhead.

Soft-input-soft output (SISO) equalization algorithms based on linear filters have a tremendous complexity advantage over trellis-diagram-based SISO equalizers, especially for high-order modulations and long-delay spread frequency selective channels. In this paper, we modify the way in which the SIC incorporates soft information. In existing literature the input to the cancellation filter is the expectation of the symbols based solely on the apriori probabilities coming from the decoder, whereas here we propose to use the conditional expectation of those symbols, given both the apriori probabilities and the received sequence. This modification results in performance gains at the expense of increased computational complexity, as compared to previous SIC-based schemes. However, by introducing an approximation to the aforementioned algorithm a linear complexity SISO equalizer can be derived. Simulation results for an 8-PSK constellation and hostile radio channels have shown the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in mitigating the intersymbol interference (ISI).

We differentially encode the signal within each OFDM symbol period. This scheme not only reduces encoding and decoding delay, but also relaxes the restriction on channel assumptions. The successful differential decoding of the proposed scheme depends on the assumption that fading channels keep constant over two OFDM symbol periods rather than multiple periods as required in previous schemes. We provide the pairwise error probability formulation, and quantify the performance criteria in terms of diversity and coding advantages. Our design criteria reveal that the existing diagonal cyclic codes can be applied to achieve full diversity with high coding gain. Performance simulations in various channel conditions show that our proposed scheme yields superior performance to the previously proposed differential schemes.	code;coding gain;encode;mimo;mimo-ofdm;pairwise error probability;simulation	Thanongsak Himsoon;Weifeng Su;K.

In this study, the authors propose a joint sparse graph (JSG) over GF(q) which combines LDS-CDMA and non-binary LDPC codes, namely JSG-CDMA. On the JSG, multiple accessing and channel coding are well-linked together, in addition, joint detection and decoding are performed by message passing algorithm. Two schedules for message updating on the JSG, that is, flooding and serial schedules, are, respectively, presented. To predict the convergence behaviour of the joint detection and decoding, they depict the iterative structure of the JSG-CDMA receiver and analyse its extrinsic information transfer chart. Key factors of JSG-CDMA include message passing schedule, maximum iteration number and Galois field order. Simulation results show that JSG-CDMA performs much better than conventional CDMA, in addition, compared with LDS-CDMA and turbo structured LDS-CDMA, at a bit error rate of 3 × 10−4, JSG-CDMA brings about 1.9 and 1.1 dB gain, respectively.	sparse graph code;sparse matrix	Lei Wen;Man Su	2015	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2014.0616	parallel computing;low-density parity-check code;bit error rate;channel code;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;gf(2);statistics	HPC	43.54643702108248	68.35786297360124	189878
501af7fd6d5854e453381d37e6c7c7bf950e8ee9	partially information coupled polar codes		We propose a new class of partially information coupled (PIC) polar codes to improve the transmission efficiency of transport block (TB)-based communication standards. In the proposed PIC polar codes, every two consecutive systematic polar code blocks (CBs) in a TB are coupled by sharing a few systematic information bits. Dummy bits are inserted at the two ends of the TB to construct terminated PIC polar codes. We propose a CB decoding scheme which only uses the information associated with correctly decoded coupled bits to mitigate the serious error propagation problem in successive cancellation based polar code decoding algorithms. We also propose an inter-CB decoding scheme which realizes a windowed decoder with variable window size to achieve a flexible tradeoff between the decoding performance and complexity. We derive a closed form expression for the TB error rate (TBER) of the PIC polar codes. We further optimize the coupling scheme based on the derived TBER. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the TBER analysis and the coupling scheme optimization results. They also show that the PIC polar codes can significantly outperform the uncoupled polar codes for various code rates with a slightly increased decoding complexity.	algorithm;clinical act of insertion;code::blocks;decoder device component;dummy variable (statistics);mathematical optimization;polar code (coding theory);propagation of uncertainty;simulation;software propagation;terabyte;window function;negative regulation of phospholipase c-activating g-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway;standards characteristics;viral integration complex	Xiaowei Wu;Lei Yang;Yixuan Xie	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2871834	parallel computing;computer science;decoding methods;polar code;distributed computing;propagation of uncertainty;word error rate;polar	HPC	42.72007559153814	62.74560475154173	189909

Experimental results are provided for independent and autoregressive Gaussian sources, binary symmetr ic channels, and absolute error and squared error distortion measures. Performance of the joint codes is compared with the tandem combination of a trellis source code and a trellis channel code on the independent Gaussian source using the squared error distortion measure operating over an additive white Gaussian noise channel. It is observed that the jointly optimized codes achieve performance close to or better than that of separately optimized tandem codes of the same constraint length. Performance improvement via a predictive joint source and channel trellis code is demonstrated for the autoregressive Gaussian source using the squared error distortion measure.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;approximation error;autoregressive model;coding theory;convolutional code;distortion;encode;ergodicity;stationary process;tandem computers;trellis quantization;utility functions on indivisible goods;waveform	Ender Ayanoglu;Robert M.

Convolutional codes are widely used in different proposals for high-speed UWB communication systems. In this paper, a novel Viterbi decoder architecture is studied for the multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) UWB system. In the Viterbi decoder, sliding block, 2-step lookahead and 2 parallel techniques are combined to achieve the highest desired data rate. For lower data rates, it is possible to disable some parts of the decoder for power saving by proper analysis of the effects of puncturing on word length and trace back length. At the same time, in the add-compare-select (ACS) unit, a pipelined most-significant bit (MSB) first ACS unit is also utilized to shorten the length of the critical path.	code;critical path method;data rate units;frequency divider;most significant bit;multiplexing;parsing;puncturing;throughput;ultra-wideband;viterbi decoder	Jun Tang;Keshab K.

For two-user GMAC, we consider that each user encodes their messages by SC-LDPC codes while joint belief propagation decoding is considered at the receiver. We present low complexity density evolution analysis of SC-LDPC GMAC codes and show simple optimisation procedure.

EXIT charts could also predict the average compression rate achieved by the RA code. However, for RA source codes the compression rate is a random variable and to the best of our knowledge simulation is the only known way to find the probability mass function (pmf) of the compression rate. In this paper, we present a tool to evaluate this pmf when the inner code is a single memory recursive convolutional code. Considering regular RA codes we then study the effect of two parameters on the accuracy of the evaluated pmf: the block length and the rate of the outer code. Simulation results show that this evaluation is fairly accurate for short block length systems and high-rate outer codes.	block code;concatenated error correction code;convolutional code;data compression;exit chart;lossless compression;recursion;repeat-accumulate code;simulation;traffic collision avoidance system	Javad Haghighat;M.

Recently, the application of efficient error correction coding schemes such as low density parity-check (LDPC) codes to systems with multi-transmit and multi-receive antennas has shown to significantly improve bit error rate performance. Although irregular LDPC codes with non-structure are quite popular due to the ease of constructing the parity check matrices and their very good error rate performance, the complexity of the encoder is high. Simple implementation of both encoder and decoder can be an asset in wireless communications applications. In this paper, we study the application of Euclidean geometry LDPC codes to the VBLAST system. We assess system performance using different code parameters and different numbers of antennas via Monte-Carlo simulation and show that the combination of Euclidean geometry LDPC codes and VBLAST can significantly improve bit error rate performance. We also show that interleaving data is necessary to improve performance of LDPC codes when a higher number of antennas is, used in order to mitigate the effect of error propagation. The simplicity of the implementation of both encoder and decoder makes Euclidean geometry LDPC codes with VBLAST system attractive and suitable for practical applications.	low-density parity-check code;performance evaluation	Panupat Poocharoen;Mario E.

The impulsive noise is modeled by a two-term Gaussian mixture distribution. Bayesian inference of all unknown quantities is made from the superimposed and noisy received signals. The Gibbs sampler (a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure) is employed to calculate the Bayesian estimates. The basic idea is to generate ergodic random samples from the joint posterior distribution of all unknown and then to average the appropriate samples to obtain the estimates of the unknown quantities. Adaptive Bayesian multiuser detectors based on the Gibbs sampler are derived for both the Gaussian noise synchronous CDMA channel and the impulsive noise synchronous CDMA channel. A salient feature of the proposed adaptive Bayesian multiuser detectors is that they can incorporate the a priori symbol probabilities, and they produce as output the a posteriori symbol probabilities. (That is, they are “soft-input soft-output” algorithms.) Hence, these methods are well suited for iterative processing in a coded system, which allows the adaptive Bayesian multiuser detector to refine its processing based on the information from the decoding stage, and vice versa—a receiver structure termed adaptive Turbo multiuser detector.	algorithm;bayesian approaches to brain function;circuit restoration;ergodicity;estimation theory;gibbs sampling;iterative method;markov chain monte carlo;monte carlo method;multi-user;multiuser dos;sampling (signal processing);sensor;utility functions on indivisible goods;white noise	Xiaodong Wang;Rong Chen	2000	IEEE Trans.

These binary signals independently drove four QPSK modulators and 4 transmitter lasers. RML launches with different offsets were used to couple light into the MM fiber core. After transmisson along the fiber the channel signals at the receiver were recovered by an optimization algorithm that maximized the Q-parameter value. The quality of the received signals varied among channels and in time but in general it was better than in the case when central launches were employed in all channels.	algorithm;code;core (optical fiber);mimo;mathematical optimization;optical fiber;pseudorandom binary sequence;pseudorandomness;transmitter	Jerzy Siuzdak;Marcin Kowalczyk;Lukasz Maksymiuk	2011	2011 20th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)	10.1109/WOCC.2011.5872277	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;pseudorandom binary sequence;optics;multi-mode optical fiber;statistics;mimo	Networks	50.52361374089461	67.51313416045815	191026

The optimal design of the affine precoder consists of a linear precoder and a training sequence, which is superimposed on the linearly precoded data in an orthogonal manner. The channel is estimated independently of the data, while the training sequence is completely nulled out in the source data detection. Furthermore, the optimal power allocation between the data and training signals is also analytically derived. Simulation results show that the proposed method is significantly better than other affine precoding methods with regard to source detection performance and computational complexity.	channel state information;computational complexity theory;interference (communication);mimo;noise power;optimal design;simulation;source data	Nam Tran Nguyen;D.

In addition to unicast communication, many important applications in HetNets, such as video/audio conferencing and mobile TV, require the support of multicast. In this article, we study the deployment of HetNets from the perspective of cooperative communications to improve the performance of physical layer multicast. Specifically, we coordinate the eNBs of different levels by fountain codes for the data transmission of a multicast session. The fountain codes in cooperative multicast are targeted to the physical layer and have to adopt short code length. Correspondingly, we propose a Reed-Solomon-based approach, which is different from the previous work on application layer forward error correction. Simulation results show that our proposed cooperative scheme can considerably increase the capacity of physical layer multicast in heterogeneous networks.	cooperative mimo;error detection and correction;forward error correction;fountain code;mobile television;multicast;reed–solomon error correction;short code;simulation;software deployment;unicast	Xianzhong Xie;Bo Rong;Tao Zhang;Weijia Lei	2011	IEEE Wireless Communications	10.1109/MWC.2011.5876501	real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;heterogeneous network;inter-domain;fountain code;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;forward error correction;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;physical layer;xcast;encoding;computer network;multicast address;data transmission	Mobile	42.96629220219674	67.96611207560974	191364

It is found that the time-varying nature of a fading channel causes significant degradation of the probability of error when the dwell time becomes longer than about 10% of the inverse of the fading bandwidth of the channel. The onset of degradation is a function of the signal-to-noise ratio and of the order of diversity. Specific probabilities of error are calculated for differential phase-shift keyed modulation (DPSK). However, the calculations can be done for any other modulation technique. >		Johannes H. Barnard;Christoff K. Pauw	1989	IEEE Trans.

The resulting generalized space-time code, therefore referred to as the BS-LD code, is shown to achieve the same rate, capacity, and performance as its protocode in flat fading channels. Moreover, our BS-LD codes exhibit a higher bandwidth efficiency when overlayed onto a block transmission method such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This property suggests BS-LD codes are ideal for use in frequency selective fading channels.	bs 7799;code;cylinder-head-sector;frequency divider;iso 8601;multiplexing;spectral efficiency	Yue Wang;Justin P.

As other multicarrier signals, MC-CDMA signals have high envelope fluctuations and a high peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR), which leads to amplification difficulties. This is particularly important for the uplink transmission, since an efficient low-cost power amplification is desirable at the mobile terminals (MTs). Moreover, the transmission over time-dispersive channels destroys the orthogonality between spreading codes, which might lead to significant multiple-access interference levels. To reduce the envelope fluctuations of the transmitted signals, while maintaining the spectral efficiency, the MC-CDMA signal associated to each MT is submitted to a clipping device, followed by a frequency-domain filtering operation. However, the nonlinear distortion effects can be high when an MC-CDMA transmitter with reduced envelope fluctuations is intended (e.g., a small clipping level and/or when successive clipping and filtering operations are employed). In this paper, we define an iterative receiver that jointly performs a turbo multiuser detection and the estimation and cancellation of the nonlinear distortion effects. Our performance results show that the proposed receiver structure allows good performances, very close to the linear receiver ones, even for high system load and/or when a PMEPR as low as 1.7 dB is intended for each MT.	clipping (computer graphics);code;decibel;dispersive partial differential equation;distortion;feedback;feedforward neural network;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;load (computing);mud;multi-user;nonlinear system;performance;rewrite (programming);spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;transmitter;turbo equalizer	Paulo Silva;Rui Dinis	2009	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2008.2010051	filter;code division multiple access;transmission time;nonlinear distortion;electronic engineering;signal-to-interference ratio;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;equalization;telecommunications link;orthogonality;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;masking;interference;coding;frequency domain;low-power electronics;spectral efficiency;detection theory	Mobile	49.730801324031674	72.44798989232959	191811

A method for estimating the dominant frequency of the interference is presented. According to the estimated frequency the filter coefficients of a bandpass error filter are generated such that its centre frequency is at the estimated one. This error filter is realized by a recursive structure with only six multiplications and is approximately of zero phase. The interference is suppressed by compensating the non-filtered signal with the filtered one. A method to extract the characteristics of the different type of interferences is also presented in order to adjust the filter to make it suitable for their rejection. The performances of the filter in the environment of a white Gaussian noise and a narrow-band interference such as single-tone, swept-tone and narrow-band Gaussian interferences are simulated by computer, which shows that by using the given filter, the system performance can be greatly improved.

At high channel error rate, hybrid type II ARQ/FEC strategies which do not discard packets in error, but combine them with suitable parity packets, have shown better performances. However it is usually assumed in the literature that the control is error free in both forward and backward directions. Without this assumption, a corrupted control makes the packet useless, which is then inevitably discarded. In this paper a hybrid type II ARQ/FEC scheme using a concatenated coding is proposed in a TDMA setting. This protocol is intended to operate under realistic conditions. To manage the reception of packets with corrupted control, an intelligent mechanism is introduced. Simulations have proven a gain in throughput when this mechanism is implemented.	forward error correction	Mohammed Braneci;Philippe Godlewski	1997		10.1109/ICC.1997.610045	sliding window protocol;communications protocol;hybrid automatic repeat request;throughput;real-time computing;error detection and correction;stop-and-wait arq;selective repeat arq;channel code;telecommunications;word error rate;computer science;noise;automatic control;forward error correction;go-back-n arq;automatic repeat request;time division multiple access;channel capacity;forward contract;statistics;computer network	Crypto	41.102487589104996	69.10449458159935	191893

Various channel conditions, such as channel spacings between the main and adjacent channels, and fade depth on the desired main channel, are examined. Baseband signal waveshape of 16-SQAM as well as the receive low-pass filter bandwidth are optimized to achieve a good P(e) performance. The result shows that 16-SQAM system is more efficient than MAMSK (multiamplitude MSK) in the frequency utilization. >	interference (communication);nonlinear system	Jong-Soo Seo;Kamilo Feher	1988	IEEE Trans.

The method, derived within information theory and probability theory, utilizes deterministic annealing to avoid some local minima that trap conventional descent algorithms such as the generalized Lloyd algorithm. The resulting vector quantizers satisfy the necessary conditions for local optimality for the noisy channel case. They tested the method against several versions of the noisy channel generalized Lloyd algorithm on stationary, first order Gauss-Markov sources with a binary symmetric channel. The method outperformed other methods under all test conditions, with the gains over noisy channel GLA growing with the codebook size. The quantizers designed using deterministic annealing are also shown to behave robustly under channel mismatch conditions. As a comparison with a separate source-channel system, over a large range of test channel conditions, the method outperformed a bandwidth-equivalent system incorporating a Hamming code. Also, for severe channel conditions, the method produces solutions with explicit error control coding. >	simulated annealing;vector quantization	David J. Miller;Kenneth Rose	1994	IEEE Trans.

Results for individual channels and ensembles are developed, and illustrated in detail for the case of small (2 × 2), uncoded, coherent systems. For example, we show that, relative to the maximum likelihood bound, LR techniques get us within 3dB for any Gaussian channel, and allow us to achieve the same diversity on the Rayleigh fading channel, when sufficiently large constellations are used.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;blast;carrier recovery;coherence (physics);iteration;iterative method;lr parser;lattice reduction;mimo;nonlinear system;rayleigh fading;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Huan Yao;Gregory W.

In this paper, an enhanced OCDMA network security mechanism with pseudo-noise (PN) type of M-sequence coding switching is presented to against eavesdropping. Signature code unique to each OCDMA network user is reconfigured in accordance with the register state of a controlling electrical shift register. Examples of signature reconfiguration following state switching of controlling shift register for both network user and eavesdropper are numerically illustrated. It is shown that, by dynamically changing PN state of shift register to reconfigure user signature sequence, eavesdropper will encounter difficulty on decoding correct data sequences. The proposed scheme hence raises a high error probability for eavesdroppers. Accordingly, the degree of the proposed optical network confidentiality can be largely improved.	antivirus software;binary decoder;card security code;codec;confidentiality;encoder;key (cryptography);network security;network switch;numerical analysis;optical switch;shift register;signature;transceiver;transmitter	Jen-Fa Huang;Sheng-Hui Meng;Kai-Sheng Chen;Ying-Chen Lin	2014	2014 28th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops	10.1109/WAINA.2014.75	telecommunications;computer science;computer network	HPC	49.43689264860186	67.08911200649044	192428

While existing LDPC codes optimized for symmetric, AWGN-like channels are being actively considered for Flash applications, we demonstrate that, due to channel asymmetry, such approaches are fairly inadequate. We propose a new, general, combinatorial framework for the analysis and design of non-binary LDPC (NB-LDPC) codes for asymmetric channels. We introduce a refined definition of absorbing sets, which we call general absorbing sets (GASs), and an important subclass of GASs, which we refer to as general absorbing sets of type two (GASTs). Additionally, we study the combinatorial properties of GASTs. We then present the weight consistency matrix (WCM), which succinctly captures key properties in a GAST. Based on these new concepts, we then develop a general code optimization framework, and demonstrate its effectiveness on the realistic highly-asymmetric normal-Laplace mixture (NLM) Flash channel. Our optimized codes enjoy over one order (resp., half of an order) of magnitude performance gain in the uncorrectable BER (UBER) relative to the unoptimized codes (resp. the codes optimized for symmetric channels).	additive white gaussian noise;flash memory;ibm notes;low-density parity-check code;mathematical optimization;naive bayes classifier;netware loadable module;program optimization;qr code;web content management system;x.690	Ahmed H.

Previous literature has shown that Minimum Bit Error Rate(MBER) based detection has outperformed Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) based detection. We pose the channel estimation problem as a detection problem and propose a novel algorithm to estimate the channel based on the MBER framework for BPSK signals. It is shown that the proposed algorithm reduces BER compared to an MMSE based channel estimation when used in MMSE or MBER detection	algorithm;bit error rate;channel state information;coefficient;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;equalization (communications);error detection and correction;interference (communication);loss function;mean squared error;numerical analysis;numerical integration;signal-to-noise ratio;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Amit Kumar Dutta;K.

Most of these links are being designed with pulsed laser transmissions, usually in the form of a coded pulse position modulated (PPM) format. Closely associated with the design of the communication link itself may be a corresponding requirement for LPI (low probability of intercept). This occurs when an intercepting optical receiver is present to determine the source location by interrogating the light field. This paper formulates a basic LPI study for a pulsed laser PPM optical link with a co-located direct detection intercepting receiver. The latter is considered to be a form of optical radiometer using continuous threshold testing to detect the presence of the transmitting laser. The various design alternatives of the coded PPM link, and their effect on the communication and LPI performance, are examined. It is shown that the use of optical pulse power spreading via multiple frame symbol coding is vital for combating the interceptor performance. This can be achieved by transmitting message symbols as repeated PPM symbols using a laser pulse of sufficiently low peak power so that the detected pulse energy is much less than the detected background energy. The possibility of both wideband and narrowband radiometers by the interceptor further limits the communicators code design choices. Some equations defining effective LPI gain parameters for the communication link are developed.	interceptor pattern;light field;lightwave 3d;linear partial information;modulation;requirement;transmitter;visual intercept	Robert M.

This scheme is more complex than the VSB modulation and coding format employed for high-definition television; and it achieves spectral-efficiency performance within 4 to 5dB of the Shannon-Bound, with relatively conservative turbo-product-codes. Special QVSB bandlimiting, which is more restrictive than Nyquist filtering, is used to minimize crosstalk between its dual overlapping, quadrature data channels. To unravel the residual cross-channel interference for detection, a quadrature-crosstalk maximum-likelihood-sequence-estimator (QC-MLSE) is needed. The QC-MLSE output is 'hard- to soft-decision converted' to improve subsequent decoding performance. An external interleaver was also used to augment the turbo-product-code's internal helical interleaver, for improved performance	bandlimiting;code;crosstalk;forward error correction;hdmi;interference (communication);maximum likelihood sequence estimation;nyquist rate;shannon (unit);single-sideband modulation;spectral efficiency	John Poklemba;David Wenzel	2006	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2006.883109	turbo code;electronic engineering;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing	Visualization	49.72559621229515	72.83756227566403	193197

In this paper, narrowband measurements at five VHF frequencies are used to evaluate the accuracy of RSS-based location algorithms. The least squares algorithm is the most accurate if the propagation model is unbiased. Location error increases linearly with mean distance from transmitters and with RSS variation caused by shadow fading or varying antenna gain. Since shadow fading increases with frequency, location accuracy decreases with frequency. A satisfactory approximation of location accuracy in a given network is obtained by the error estimates that are based on linearization but modified when the receiver is close to one transmitter. Kalman filtering performed on the estimated coordinates removes the largest location errors, but it does not improve the median accuracy significantly due to the correlated shadowing process	algorithm;approximation;curve fitting;decibel;distortion;kalman filter;least squares;rss;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;transmitter;truncation	Heikki Laitinen;Suvi Juurakko;Timo Lahti;Risto Korhonen;Jaakko Lähteenmäki	2007	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2006.883785	kalman filter;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	52.03032704031804	73.13074725089362	193451

Of these, selective protocols, while the most efficient, have the notable drawback of requiring large buffers at the receiver side. A new selective ARQ protocol with a finite-length buffer is described in this paper. If A' is the number of codewords transmit-table in the round-trip delay, the described protocol requires a buffer having length equal to N + Na Na≥2 being an integer. A lower bound on the throughput of the described ARQ protocol is derived. The proposed protocol achieves higher throughputs than similar schemes, giving comparable results to selective protocols with infinite-length buffers for high error rates in the communication channel.

In the proposed method, the duration of each bit is divided into Ns frames, each one containing L chips. Two signature codes, namely, one pseudonoise (PN) sequence and one OOC, are assigned to each user. During each bit interval, based on the output of an channel encoder and the user's dedicated PN sequence, one of the Ns frames is selected, in which W pulses are transmitted in W chips, marked by the user's OOC. We consider three detectors at the receiver front end, namely, correlation, soft chip-level, and hard chip-level detectors. We evaluate the multiple-access performance of the system for each detector considering the effects of shot noise, dark current, and thermal noise. We compare the results with those obtained for the conventional OCDMA systems. Our numerical results indicate that, for the same bit rate and bandwidth, our proposed method substantially outperforms the conventional OCDMA system. Our results also show that the soft chip-level detector outperforms the other detection techniques in all cases considered	code;coding theory;dark current (physics);encoder;fiber-optic communication;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;johnson–nyquist noise;jumbo frame;numerical analysis;optical fiber;profiling (computer programming);pseudorandom noise;pseudorandom number generator;sensor;shot noise;system on a chip	Mahdi Karimi;Masoumeh Nasiri-Kenari	2007	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2006.888876	computer simulation;embedded system;electronic engineering;error detection and correction;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	48.303818659667506	67.61483972416363	193635

In particular, for the binary erasure channel (BEC), the problem is to find the elements of selected irregular LDPC code ensembles with the size of their minimum stopping set being maximized. Due to the lack of analytical solutions to this problem, a simple but powerful heuristic design algorithm, the approximate cycle extrinsic message degree (ACE) constrained design algorithm, has recently been proposed. Building upon the ACE metric associated with a cycle in a code graph, we introduce the ACE spectrum of LDPC codes as a useful tool for evaluation of codes from selected irregular LDPC code ensembles. Using the ACE spectrum, we generalize the ACE constrained design algorithm, making it more flexible and efficient. We justify the ACE spectrum approach through examples and simulation results.	ace;approximation algorithm;automatic computing engine;binary erasure channel;c++;error floor;heuristic;low-density parity-check code;performance;qr code;simulation;waterfall model;x.690	Dejan Vukobratovic;Vojin Senk	2009	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2009.08.070548	combinatorics;low-density parity-check code;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	Mobile	43.34959917500263	65.67746881962373	193835

It is shown that reprocessing with a simple additional algebraic decoding effort achieves significant coding gain. For long codes, the order of reprocessing required to achieve asymptotic optimum error performance is reduced by approximately 1/3. This significantly reduces the computational complexity, especially for long codes. Also, a more efficient criterion for stopping the decoding process is derived based on the knowledge of the algebraic decoding solution.	algorithm;coding gain;computational complexity theory;linear algebra;linear code	Marc P.

Therefore, large computational complexities can be reduced.

Both algorithms are soft-input, soft-output devices which receive the a posteriori probability of each chip from the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) filter that suppresses both ISI and MAI. Using this soft information and the structure of TH codes, the blind synchronizer produces the probabilities of time delays which are fed into the channel decoder. In addition to the knowledge of TH codes and the soft information coming from the MMSE filter, the data-aided synchronizer uses a training sequence in the generation of the probabilities of time delays. Although the channel decoder for chip-interleaved systems is rather simple, here it is redesigned to incorporate the soft information. The resulting receivers perform as well as iterative equalization with perfect timing information, and catch the single-user performance at moderate signal-to-noise ratios.	additive white gaussian noise;broadcast delay;catastrophic interference;channel state information;code;computer simulation;equalization (communications);expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;information sciences institute;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;multi-user;multiuser dos;output device;signal-to-noise ratio;simplified instructional computer;synchronizer (algorithm);ultra-wideband	Ersen Ekrem;Mutlu Koca;Hakan Deliç	2010	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2010.072610.081419	synchronization;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;ultra-wideband;mathematics;iterative method;statistics	Mobile	48.4910769565515	73.20430511024549	195397

Several proposals have been carried out to construct multi-rate LDPC codes, among which, Row-combining and Row-splitting with Edge Variation (RCSEV) helps construct LDPC codes with constant code length and simple hardware architecture. Besides, Column Extension (CE) is also an effective method for rate-compatible LDPC code design. This paper proposes an improved scheme of Row-Combining and splitting with Edge Variation and Column Deletion (RCSEV-CD), which is the rational combination of RCSEV and CE. RCSEV is carried out to generate multi-rate LDPC codes sharing the same code length in basic code group. The codes in extended code group are generated via CD, ensuring same code length in each extended code groups. Multi-rate codes within a code group improves the flexibility of a service while the code groups meet the requirement of multiple services. EXIT chart analysis helps guide the trade-off between column degree distributions among multiple rates. A comparison with multi-rate codes in DVB-S2 is performed via bit error rate (BER) simulation and the result shows the superior performance of our designed codes at typical code rates.	bit error rate;dvb-s2;digital video broadcasting;exit chart;effective method;low-density parity-check code;noisy-channel coding theorem;shannon (unit);simulation;terrestrial television;x.690	Yue Liu;Kewu Peng	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting	10.1109/BMSB.2014.6873508	concatenated error correction code;electronic engineering;low-density parity-check code;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics;error floor	Arch	43.44672596849813	63.14343268832726	195845

As the channel matrix deviates from orthogonal, these methods result in a waste of transmit power. This paper proposes a trellis precoding method (across time and space) to improve the power efficiency. Adopting a 4-state trellis shaping method, the complexity of the proposed method, which is entirely at the transmitter side, is equivalent to the search in a trellis with 4N states where N is the number of transmit antennas. Numerical results are presented showing that the achievable gains, which depend on the channel realization, can be significantly higher than the traditional shaping gain which is limited to 1.53 dB.	decibel;mimo;mean squared error;noise shaping;performance per watt;standard database management analysis;transmitter;trellis quantization	Aaron Callard;Amir K.

We consider a continuous alphabet source without memory over a slow Rayleigh fading channel. Specifically, it is initially assumed that the Rayleigh parameter remains constant over a specific time interval and the demodulator has available perfect estimates of the Rayleigh parameter. An analysis of the problem is presented and theoretical justification is provided for using the MDSQ. For a Gaussian source without memory, performance comparisons are presented against a traditional maximum ratio combiner (MRC)-based system as well as against channel code-based systems. It is shown that the performance of the MDSQ-based system dominates the MRC-based system at all channel signal-to-noise ratios and is superior to channel code-based systems when the interleaving delay is constrained. Simulation results for a mobile radio channel model at 15 m.p.h. indicate a reduction in the interleaving delay by at least a factor of three.	quantization (signal processing);rayleigh fading	Shih-Ming Yang;Vinay A.

In particular, multiple analog radio frequency (RF) chains, which are expensive and power consuming, are required at both the transmitter and receiver sides. On the other hand, the antennas connecting to the RF chains are less expensive. Hence, one engineering compromise is to implement more antennas than RF chains and to use only a subset of them based on some antenna selection (AS) algorithm. An interesting question therefore arises: given a RF chain limited MIMO system, what is the fundamental performance gain by adding more antennas? In this two-part paper, we answer this question by using the diversity-multiplexing (D-M) gain tradeoff metric. Consider a Rayleigh fading channel with M<sub>t</sub>) antennas and L<sub>t</sub> (L<sub>t</sub> les M<sub>t</sub>) RF chains at the transmitter while M<sub>r</sub> antennas and L<sub>r</sub> (L<sub>r</sub> les M<sub>r</sub>) RF chains at the receiver. We obtain the fundamental D-M tradeoff as a function of M<sub>t</sub>, M<sub>r</sub>, and min(L<sub>r</sub>, L<sub>t</sub>). Referring to the special case where L<sub>t</sub> = M<sub>t</sub>) and L<sub>r</sub> = M<sub>r</sub> as the RF unlimited system (or full system) and RF limited system (or pruned system) otherwise, we prove that the pruned system with optimal channel-dependent AS has the same D-M tradeoff as the full system if the multiplexing gain is less than some integer threshold P, while it suffers from some diversity gain loss for multiplexing gains larger than P. In particular, if min(L<sub>r</sub>, L<sub>t</sub>) = K = min(M<sub>r</sub>, M<sub>t</sub>), then P = K, i.e. the D-M tradeoffs of the pruned system and the full system are the same. Moreover, this result can be extended to more general fading channels such as Nakagami channel. A fast and D-M tradeoff-optimal AS algorithm is proposed as a byproduct of our analysis.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;householder transformation;mimo;markov chain;multiplexing;radio frequency;rayleigh fading;transmitter	Yi Jiang;Mahesh K.

The original CD codes are designed based on the criterion of maximizing the expected distance between codeword pairs. However, in practical systems, it is more sensible to design the codes according to the minimum error rate criterion. The main difficulty in such a design is that the error probability does not admit a closed-form expression and, thus, conventional optimization methods cannot be applied. In this paper, we formulate the minimum error-rate CD code design as an unconstrained stochastic optimization problem, and employ the stochastic approximation technique with gradient estimation to solve it. Simulation results show that codes generated by the proposed design procedure generally outperform the CD codes designed by maximizing the expected distance between codeword pairs and the Cayley threaded algebraic space-time codes that satisfy the full rank criterion. The new CD codes also enjoy better or comparable performance over other group based or nongroup designs.	code word;imaginary time;magma;mathematical optimization;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;optimization problem;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;stochastic approximation;stochastic gradient descent;stochastic optimization	Jibing Wang;Xiaodong Wang;Mohammad Madihian	2005	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2005.853799	block code;concatenated error correction code;stochastic approximation;mathematical optimization;turbo code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;channel code;word error rate;computer science;probability of error;stochastic optimization;linear code;mathematics;score;space–time code;error floor;code generation;statistics;satisfiability	Embedded	42.22741059534588	71.40340684834342	196282

This LP decoder can be used to decode error-correcting codes at bit-error-rates comparable to state-of-the-art belief propagation (BP) decoders, but with significantly stronger theoretical guarantees. However, LP decoding when implemented with standard LP solvers does not easily scale to the block lengths of modern error correcting codes. In this paper, we draw on decomposition methods from optimization theory, specifically the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), to develop efficient distributed algorithms for LP decoding. The key enabling technical result is a “two-slice” characterization of the parity polytope, the polytope formed by taking the convex hull of all codewords of the single parity check code. This new characterization simplifies the representation of points in the polytope. Using this simplification, we develop an efficient algorithm for Euclidean norm projection onto the parity polytope. This projection is required by the ADMM decoder and its solution allows us to use LP decoding, with all its theoretical guarantees, to decode large-scale error correcting codes efficiently. We present numerical results for LDPC codes of lengths more than 1000. The waterfall region of LP decoding is seen to initiate at a slightly higher SNR than for sum-product BP, however an error floor is not observed for LP decoding, which is not the case for BP. Our implementation of LP decoding using the ADMM executes as fast as our baseline sum-product BP decoder, is fully parallelizable, and can be seen to implement a type of message-passing with a particularly simple schedule.	augmented lagrangian method;baseline (configuration management);belief propagation;code word;convex hull;dvd region code;decoding methods;distributed algorithm;error detection and correction;error floor;forward error correction;lp-type problem;level of detail;linear programming decoding;list decoding;low-density parity-check code;mathematical optimization;message passing;numerical analysis;parity bit;signal-to-noise ratio;simplex algorithm;software propagation;solver	Siddharth Barman;Xishuo Liu;Stark C.

It consists of a whitened matched filter followed by a sequential algorithm. A key component of a sequential estimator is a suitable metric that accounts for the unequal search depth. This metric is derived for the ISI channel. Computer simulations for three different channels show that the sequential sequence estimator has considerably less computational complexity than a maximum-likelihood sequence estimator using the Viterbi algorithm (MLSE-VA), while still maintaining the optimum estimation performance of the MLSE-VA, a performance not achievable with any reduced-state Viterbi algorithm. >	interference (communication)	Fuqin Xiong;Ali Zerik;Edward Shwedyk	1990	IEEE Trans.

The principle idea is to modify the extrinsic information between the component decoders to eliminate the effect of error propagation between the decoders, depending on the channel conditions between the source, the relay and the destination nodes in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per bit. The performance of this decoder is compared with the performance of an iterative decoder proposed in the literature which is called normal iterative decoder (NID) in this paper and does not take into account the decoding errors at the relay, by simulation. The comparison shows that the IID outperforms the NID when the source-relay channel is bad with low SNR, thus yielding lots of decoding errors at the relay.	direction finding;heuristic;iteration;iterative method;modulation;network interface device;numerical analysis;propagation of uncertainty;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;trellis quantization	Khoa Quang Huynh;Tor Aulin	2012	2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328516	turbo code;convolutional code;real-time computing;soft-decision decoder;trellis modulation;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;systematics;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio	Arch	43.30224541728716	67.26901176993327	196793
7c07d18a449d5c0aedb42dfba2f3b0e8b1d61988	analysis of the dual-threshold-based shrinking scheme for efficient nb-ldpc decoding		In this paper, the dual-threshold-based shrinking (DTBS) scheme for efficient non-binary low-density parity-check (NB-LDPC) decoding, which has been initially presented in our previous work [1], is further studied. Particularly, the TIT-MSA is an example to employ this scheme presented in [1]. Its computational complexity is theoretically analyzed in this paper. Numerical results show that more than 70% computational complexity is reduced compared with the SMSA, while the error performance loss is negligible. Besides, when considering memory consumption, we extend this scheme by setting a maximum number of kept values with an efficient searching method, and apply it to the TIT-MSA. Simulation results indicate that the new decoding algorithm achieves both comparable error performance and significant memory reduction. For example, the memory consumption is reduced by about 61% for a (256, 203) code over GF(28) and about 31% for an (837, 726) code over GF(25).

The achievable spectral efficiency in bits/s/Hz is used as the criterion for comparing various design choices. The focus is on wideband code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems when the receiver uses the matched-filter or the minimum mean-squared error detector, followed by single-user decoders. The spreading sequences of the CDMA system are assumed to be random across the users, but could be dependent across the transmit antennas of each user. Using analytical results in the large system asymptote, guidelines are provided for the sequence design across the transmit antennas and for choosing the number of antennas. In addition, comparisons are made between (random) CDMA and orthogonal multiaccess with multiple antennas. It is shown that CDMA, even with single-user decoding, can outperform orthogonal multiaccess when the number of receive antennas is sufficiently large.	asymptote;error detection and correction;mimo;matched filter;mean squared error;mobile phone;multi-user;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;transmitter	Ashok Mantravadi;Venugopal V.

Simulation results indicate that the proposed design greatly improves the bit error rate (BER) performance for the relay system.	anisotropic filtering;bit error rate;channel capacity;coding gain;duplex (telecommunications);ergodicity;modulation;relay;simulation;x.690	Yanwu Ding;Jian-Kang Zhang;Kon Max Wong	2008	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2008.070226	number theory;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;relay channel;statistics	Mobile	42.622426402212554	73.35569015967222	197151

In this paper, we develop fast ML decoding algorithms for orthogonal space-time-frequency block codes (OSTFBC) and quasi orthogonal space-time-frequency block codes (QOSTFBC) in clipped MIMO-OFDM systems by using a clipping noise model with Gaussian approximation. By using the statistics of the clipping distortions, our newly proposed fast ML decoding algorithms improve the performance for clipped MIMO-OFDM systems with OSTFBC and QOSTFBC without increasing the decoding complexity. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the improvement.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;approximation;code;colors of noise;computer simulation;decoding methods;distortion;mimo;mimo-ofdm;soft-in soft-out decoder;utility functions on indivisible goods	Zhefeng Li;Xiang-Gen Xia	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.289	block code;concatenated error correction code;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;sequential decoding;theoretical computer science;gaussian process;mathematics;statistics	HPC	45.19225138102317	73.91526575042435	197195

The use of short frames has a direct impact on the physical layer, especially on the forward-error correction code (FEC) performance. In this article, lattice based codes are used to achieve an efficient joint decoding of the code and the modulation. The linear group structure of lattices makes it possible to design a decoder based on a sphere decoder. To improve the performance for lower spectral efficiencies, the decoder design takes into account the inevitable lattice shaping processing of the transmitter. With a small number of dimensions, the frame lengths are very short and well suited to MTC. A comparison in frame error rate is performed between the proposed lattice code and an LTE inspired baseline, designed upon the LTE turbo code. Simulation results show that for equivalent spectral efficiencies, a gain in frame length is obtained. This frame length reduction can be employed for increasing the number of users in a machine type communication system.	baseline (configuration management);compaq lte;computer simulation;error detection and correction;forward error correction;frame grabber;metis;modulation;noise shaping;puncturing;simulation;spectral efficiency;stellar classification;transmitter;turbo code	Carole Al Bechlawi;Frédéric Guilloud	2015	2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145846	concatenated error correction code;turbo code;hybrid automatic repeat request;electronic engineering;real-time computing;constant-weight code;low-density parity-check code;error detection and correction;soft-decision decoder;telecommunications;computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes	Mobile	44.24344809362546	68.38233657793714	197406

We compute the limitation of the ratio between the probability of decoding error for the GMD or any one of the Chase decoding algorithms and that of the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approaches infinity. If the minimum Hamming distance of the code is greater than 2, the limitation is shown to be equal to 1 and thus the GMD and Chase decoding algorithms are asymptotically optimum.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;golm metabolome database	Yuansheng Tang;Toru Fujiwara;Tadao Kasami	2002	IEEE Trans.

The analysis yields a compact expression which accurately approximates the growth rate function for the case of small linear-weight codewords. This paper generalizes existing results for LDPC and generalized LDPC (GLDPC) codes. Ensembles with smallest check or variable node minimum distance greater than 2 are shown to have good growth-rate behavior, while for other ensembles a fundamental parameter is identified which discriminates between an asymptotically small and an asymptotically large expected number of small linear-weight codewords. Also, in the latter case it is shown that the growth rate depends only on the check and variable nodes with minimum distance 2. An important connection between this new result and the stability condition of D-GLDPC codes over the BEC is highlighted. Such a connection, previously observed for LDPC and GLDPC codes, is now extended to the case of D-GLDPC codes. Finally, it is shown that the analysis may be extended to include the growth rate of the stopping set size distribution of irregular D-GLDPC codes.	battery eliminator circuit;code word;low-density parity-check code	Mark F.

A general expression for electrical average crosstalk noise power due to XPM and GVD was derived to measure the system performance for increasing number of WDM channels. Using the expression, we show that XPM and GVD causes crosstalk in the system and imposes a power penalty as the WDM channels increases for a given channel spacing and modulating frequency. These results are extended to show that the system can be optimized to achieve a minimum BER of 10-9 by controlling the channel spacing and modulating frequency as the number of WDM channels increases.	channel spacing;cross-phase modulation;crosstalk;mathematical optimization;noise power;passive optical network;semiconductor industry;velocity (software development);wavelength-division multiplexing;x pixmap;x.690	Hairul A.

Based on the approach of kernel density estimation for approximating the bit error rate (BER) from training data, a least mean squares (LMS) style stochastic gradient adaptive algorithm is developed for training linear multiuser detectors. Computer simulation is used to study the convergence speed and steady-state BER misadjustment of this adaptive MBER linear multiuser detector, and the results show that it outperforms an existing LMS-style adaptive MBER algorithm first presented at Globecom’98 by Yehet al.	adaptive algorithm;bit error rate;computer simulation;gradient;kernel density estimation;least mean squares filter;multi-user;multipath propagation;sensor;steady state;x.690	Sheng Chen;Ahmad K.

If hybrid ARQ-II with code combining is applied, retransmissions are reduced and frame error rate is lowered when the channel experiences heavy traffic. It is an adaptive optimization of the balance between the CDMA processing gain and FEC coding gain. Simulation shows that using hybrid ARQ-II with code combing in PMCAP/CDMA can improve the delay performance in AWGN channels. Code limitation strategies can decrease the multiple access interference (MAI) level and frame error rate, which in turn improves the system performance when the background noise is very high.	hybrid automatic repeat request	Wenhua Jiao;Shu Li	2002		10.1109/GLOCOM.2002.1188223	turbo code;hybrid automatic repeat request;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;coding gain;computer performance;statistics;computer network	ECom	41.29971935103981	69.39760429369035	198331

When the sub-optimal receiver for the latter is replaced by an improved quasi-optimal metric, the difference in performance of the two techniques is much reduced for slow fading, while for fast fading, the bit-by-bit scheme is superior. HE AUTHORS of [1] should be commended on a thorT ough and insightful comparison of the two techniques, that they label A) bit-by-bit and B) word-by-word. Aside from the issue of the increased memory required for B), there is a major limitation to the value of their results. The authors have chosen as the standard against which to compare their new scheme B), the scheme based on the bit-bybit decoder which derives its metric from the single envelopecorrelator with the highest energy. This is the technique described in 121 (161 in the previous paper). This turns out to be a suboptimal metric, even for the bit-by-bit decoder. Liu [3] derived the optimum metric for bit-by-bit decoding, which involves a complicated function of all M envelopecorrelator outputs. Because of the complexity in generating this optimum metric, an approximation and simplification was developed in [4], which has also recently been published in [5]. This quasi-optimum metric is called “dual-maxima,’’ since it is derived from the two maxima of the two sets of MI2 envelope correlator outputs, for which the bit in question is a zero and a one, respectively. The relative performance of the single-maximum and dualmaxima metrics in an additive white Gaussian noise channel, as determined from Chernoff bounds, is shown in Table I. The first column is the (code) symbol energy-to-noise density for a coherent demodulator, while the second and third columns are the excess symbol energy (over coherent) required for Paper approved by R.

In this paper we also prove that the performance of the FDE-SUD is practically identical to that of linear MUD for a fully loaded UMTS cell. Furthermore, armed with the idea of FDE for code division multiple access (CDMA), we can construct a common receiver structure for CDMA, time division multiple access (TDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and multi-carrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) systems. This is an extremely useful idea in enabling a software-defined radio (SDR) which can operate seamlessly in several environments such as UMTS, the IEEE 802.11a and WiMaX. FDE based receivers could be one important building-block for the next generation mobile communications.

These constraints commonly arise in magnetic recording channels. This system is characterized by a high-rate turbo code driving a high-rate (n-1)/n, small-length (O, /spl kappa/) block code. We discuss the properties of the (O, /spl kappa/) code that affect its performance on both an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and a precoded dicode channel. We address soft-in soft-out (SISO) decoding of linear and nonlinear (O, /spl kappa/) codes and show that good (O, /spl kappa/) codes exist even when d/sub min/=1. For the (O, /spl kappa/) constrained AWGN channel, we present several rate (n-1)/n block codes that optimally tradeoff bit-error-rate performance with /spl kappa/. For the precoded dicode channel, we show that the systematic (O, n-1) modulation codes are superior to most other rate (n-1)/n block codes in terms of error-rate performance, and their attractiveness is increased by the fact that they do not contribute any significant complexity to the overall system.

In the proposed algorithm, a redundancy coding matrix is implemented as an analog version of the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) that is commonly used for data verification in digital communication. On the basis of this analog CRC, we propose an alternate decoding scheme with iterative decoding. In each iteration of the algorithm, the problem of decoding the long block code is decoupled into a set of parallel LP/LASSO subproblems. In the sparse noise model, this leads to a significant reduction in decoding complexity as compared to one-step convex programming decoding. The new code has improved correction capability compared to Zanko et al. In the almost sparse noise model, energy detectors are used to verify the decoding correctness of the inner code before transferring the result to the next iteration. In this case, the Turbo decoder shows little loss compared to the oracle bound based on least squares when the impulsive noises are perfectly known at the receiver.	algorithm;block code;code word;concatenated error correction code;constant false alarm rate;convex optimization;correctness (computer science);cyclic redundancy check;error detection and correction;forward error correction;iteration;lp-type problem;lasso;least squares;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;sensor;simulation;sparse matrix;universal product code	Avi Zanko;Amir Leshem;Ephraim Zehavi	2016	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2015.2491879	list decoding;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;low-density parity-check code;speech recognition;soft-decision decoder;sparse matrix;sequential decoding;computer science;noise;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;mathematics;berlekamp–welch algorithm;error floor;encoding	AI	43.02907722511982	61.86846372327208	199158

The overlaid Spread Spectrum (SS) system is assumed to utilize direct sequence (DS) spreading, using maximal length pseudorandom sequences. We studied the performance degradation of the analog FM system due to the interference produced by the SS signal, through laboratory subjective and objective measurements, for various types of spreading scenarios and for different carrier frequency differences ( ). The RF protection ratios for the FM receivers are derived, along with SINAD measurements. Finally, these experimental results have been compared with the theoretical study of the FM receiver’s audio frequency SNR output due to SS interference.	carrier frequency;elegant degradation;fm broadcasting;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;interference (communication);maximal set;pseudorandomness;radio frequency;sinad;signal-to-noise ratio	Demosthenes Vouyioukas;Philip Constantinou	2003	TBC	10.1109/TBC.2003.810073	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;frequency deviation;spread spectrum	Networks	51.39814119166297	70.95291689023152	199740

This watermarking algorithm is known to be one of the best among the high rate watermarking schemes. Nevertheless, recent researches reveal its security weakness. Previously, we proposed to reinforce its security by using a secret space before the embedding. This secret space requires to compute projections onto secrets carriers. When dealing with high rate watermarking, the CPU cost for those projections is dramatically high. After introducing the watermarking scheme, we then propose two Space Division Multiplexing (SDM) approaches which reduce the complexity. Evaluations are achieved with four different attacks and show that our proposal gives better robustness results with SDM approaches.	algorithm;ambiguous name resolution;central processing unit;coefficient;computational complexity theory;convolutional code;dvd region code;digital watermarking;elegant degradation;linear algebra;multiplexing;trellis quantization;wavelet	Marc Chaumont	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03688-0_12	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics	EDA	45.62299378593785	67.1754236872763	199820

In particular, it demonstrates that the disparity between sequential and Viterbi decoding increases dramatically for long memory codes with high rates and for such codes, the union bound cannot be used as a criterion for selecting good codes for sequential decoders. In contrast, it shows that the proposed methods can be used as efficient tools for performance evaluation and/or identification of good high-rate punctured convolutional codes for use with sequential decoders.	convolutional code;viterbi algorithm	Khurram Muhammad;Khaled Ben Letaief	1995	IEEE Trans.
