This direction-finding method is based on a phase-difference measurement between two close receiving arrays. To model the associated bathymetric error, it is necessary to know the second-order moment of the interferometric phase estimator. This paper explains the connection between bathymetric variance and interferometric phase variance and the difficulty in the evaluation of the phase second-order estimation. Thus, a brief statistical overview of the interferometric phase estimator for fully developed speckle signals (called here RMPC for random modulus partially correlated signals) is introduced in this paper. The focus of this paper is the derivation of simple empirical variance that matches the exact values in both single-look and multilook cases. For the sake of constituency, the construction of these empirical approximations is based on a modified asymptotic expression of the second order for the phase estimator assuming high signal-to-noise ratio. In order to perform these derivations, it appears necessary to introduce a new kind of signal (namely, CMPC for constant modulus partially correlated signal) whose modulus is assumed constant. This family of signals, whose physical existence is also investigated, appears as an alternative way to derive RMPC empirical formulas. The link between RMPC and CMPC signals is established through the conditional expectation of the signal modulus. Finally, the existence of these two statistical behaviors is tested over real underwater data.	approximation;bathymetry;modulus of continuity;modulus robot;radar;sonar (symantec);signal-to-noise ratio	Christophe Sintes;Gerard Llort-Pujol	2012	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2011.2172446	computer simulation;random variable;mathematics;optics;signal-to-noise ratio;physics;statistics;monte carlo method	ML	52.634488432217545	9.656138981556154	47853

We derive, for several distance criteria, single-letter expressions for the maximum attainable conditional entropy as well as corresponding universal simulation schemes that asymptotically attain these maxima.	conditional entropy;markov chain;markov model;maxima;simulation	Neri Merhav;Marcelo J.

A conditional functional limit theorem for the properly scaled process $\left\{ \log Z_{pu},0\leq u 0$ and $p\ll n$.

In this paper, range errors are modelled using the skew-t distribution. An Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm for computing the unknown location is presented, and its accuracy is compared with a descending Gauss-Newton algorithm by simulations. The EM algorithm improves the positioning accuracy significantly. Furthermore, it is shown how to fit the parameters of a skew-t distribution to training data using a Gibbs sampler.	expectation–maximization algorithm;gauss–newton algorithm;gibbs sampling;multipath propagation;newton;radio wave;sampling (signal processing);simulation	Philipp Müller;Robert Piché	2015	2015 International Conference on Location and GNSS (ICL-GNSS)	10.1109/ICL-GNSS.2015.7217164	econometrics;mathematical optimization;non-sampling error;gibbs sampling;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	52.375532258245165	4.575312207323315	48745

What method should the observer use to make this decision, and what receiver is a realization of that method? After giving a discussion of theoretical aspects of this problem, the paper presents specific derivations of the optimum receiver for a number of cases of practical interest. The receiver whose output is the value of the likelihood ratio of the input voltage over the observation interval is the answer to the second question no matter which of the various optimum methods current in the literature is employed including the Neyman Pearson observer, Siegert's ideal observer, and.Woodward and Davies' tlobserver.lV An optimum observer required to give a yes or no answer simply chooses an operating level and concludes that the receiver input arose from signal plus noise only when this level is exceeded by the output of his likelihood ratio receiver. Associated with each such operating level are conditional probabilities that the answer is a false alarm and the conditional probability of detection. Graphs of these quantities, called receiver operating characteristic, or ROC, curves are convenient for evaluating a receiver. If the detection problem is changed by varying, for example, the signal power, then a family of ROC curves is generated. Such things as betting curves can easily be obtained from such a family. The operating level to be used in a particular situation must be chosen by the observer. His choice will depend on such factors as the permissable false alarm rate, a priori probabilities, and relative importance of errors. With these theoretical aspects serving as sn introduction, attention is devoted to the derivation of explicit formulas for likelihood ratio, and for probability of detection and probability of false alarm, for a number of particular cases. Stationary, band-limited, white Gaussian noise is assumed.. The seven special cases which sre presented were chosen from the simplest problems in signal detection which closely represent practical situations. Two of the cases form a basis for the best available approximation to the important problem of finding probability of detection when the starting time of the signal, signal frequency, or both, are l l&TlOUn. Furthermore, in these two cases uncertainty in the signal can be varied, and a quantitative relationship between uncertainty and ability to detect signals is presented for these two rather general cases. The variety of examples presented should serve to suggest methods for attacking other simple signal detection problems and to give insight into problems too complicated to allow a direct solution.	approximation;bandlimiting;detection theory;explicit substitution;image noise;receiver operating characteristic;stationary process	W.

We propose a joint decision and estimation (JDE) formulation, which amounts to minimizing a risk related to both decision and estimation while decision performance is also constrained within a tolerable level. The risk used in this paper is a weighted sum of estimation costs conditioned on correct decisions times the correct decision probabilities. Such a risk allows us to focus on the joint (decision and estimation) performance pertinent to correct decisions only. The JDE solution includes handling two subproblems - estimation and decision. For the estimation subproblem, we derive the optimal Bayes estimator. For the decision subproblem, we provide the optimal solution via a numerical algorithm of a two-dimensional search. To reduce the complexity, we also provide a suboptimal solution when the decision rule is confined to the likelihood ratio tests. The suboptimal solution is implemented with a one-dimensional search in a finite range. Numerical results are provided to validate our methods.	algorithm;dynamical system;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;recursion;relevance;weight function	Yongxin Gao;Enbin Song;X.

Our main interest is in the asymptotic behavior of a discrete-state, continuous-time process with an imbedded point process. We present a sample-path analogue of the renewal-reward theorem, which we callY=λX. We then applyY=λX to derive several relations involving the transition rates and the asymptotic (long-run) state frequencies at an arbitrary point in time and at the points of the imbedded point process. Included are sample-path versions of the rate-conservation principle, the global-balance conditions, and the insensitivity of the asymptotic frequency distribution to the distribution of processing time in a LCFS-PR service facility. We also provide a natural sample-path characterization of the PASTA property.	path analysis (statistics)	Shaler Stidham;Muhammad El-Taha	1989	Queueing Syst.	10.1007/BF01149190	path analysis;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;calculus;point process;mathematics;statistics	Metrics	43.29920715097137	12.349050118971261	49525

It is assumed that the unitary matrix U relating both bases is distributed according to the Haar measure on the unitary group. We provide lower bounds on the average Shannon entropy of probability distributions related to both measurements. The bounds are stronger than these obtained with use of the entropic uncertainty relation by Maassen and Uffink, and they are optimal up to additive constants. We also analyze the case of a large number of measurements and obtain strong entropic uncertainty relations which hold with high probability with respect to the random choice of bases. The lower bounds we obtain are optimal up to additive constants and allow us to establish the conjecture by Wehner and Winter on the asymptotic behavior of constants in entropic uncertainty relations as the dimension tends to infinity. As a tool we develop estimates on the maximum operator norm of a submatrix of a fixed size of a random unitary matrix distributed according to the Haar measure, which are of an independent interest.	entropic uncertainty;entropy (information theory);haar wavelet;hilbert space;shannon (unit);stephanie wehner;uncertainty principle;utility functions on indivisible goods;with high probability	Radoslaw Adamczak;Rafal Latala;Zbigniew Puchala;Karol Zyczkowski	2014	CoRR	10.1063/1.4944425	probability distribution;entropy;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;mutually unbiased bases;entropic uncertainty;mathematics;physics;quantum mechanics;hilbert space	Theory	45.347698433775456	14.766908507760467	50592

In ABMs with a sequential update scheme by which one agent is chosen to update its state at a time, transitions are only allowed between system configurations that differ with respect to a single agent. This characterizes ABMs as random walks on regular graphs. The non-trivial automorphisms of those graphs make visible the dynamical symmetries that an ABM gives rise to because sets of micro configurations can be interchanged without changing the probability structure of the random walk. This allows for a systematic loss-less reduction of the state space of the model.	agent-based model;directed graph;dynamical system;graph automorphism;iteration;markov chain;observable;state space;window function	Sven Banisch	2014	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics	AI	41.5682507343743	8.78382800192691	51380

Infinite-horizon specifications such as probabilistic invariance, reachability and reach-avoid have formally been characterized and computed based on this structural property of the model. This paper further extends these recent results by investigating stability properties of the model over absorbing sets. Theoretical results are developed to study attractivity properties of such sets, and the outcomes are applied over a case study.	markov property;model checking;reachability;state space	Ilya Tkachev;Alessandro Abate	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6426410	markov chain;mathematical optimization;markov kernel;combinatorics;discrete phase-type distribution;discrete mathematics;stability;formal verification;mathematics;markov process;markov model;statistics;set theory;variable-order markov model	Robotics	39.347432208116416	5.277810793327851	51384

We then describe the dualistic nature of Voronoi diagrams for 1-qubit quantum states inside the 3D Bloch ball representation. We show that these diagrams can be computed as Bregman Voronoi diagrams for the corresponding Bregman generator acting on Hermitian density matrices. This implies that these dual diagrams can be derived from power diagrams of balls in the Laguerre geometry, and allows one to prove by equivalence that the von Neumann quantum Voronoi diagram on the degenerated Bloch sphere of pure quantum states coincides with the ordinary Euclidean Voronoi diagram, bypassing the fact that the quantum divergence is not defined there. We then show how to compute the Holevo channel capacity of 1-qubit quantum states, and provide a practical approximation algorithm based on Bregman core-sets. Finally, we define the quantum sided centroids that yield practical upper bounds on the Holevo capacity in linear time.	approximation algorithm;bloch sphere;bregman divergence;channel capacity;computation;computational geometry;density matrix;distortion;information theory;kullback–leibler divergence;machine learning;quantum computing;quantum information;quantum state;time complexity;turing completeness;voronoi diagram	Frank Nielsen;Richard Nock	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594955	time complexity;quantum operation;entropy;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;weighted voronoi diagram;voronoi diagram;quantum information science;computational geometry;quantum t-design;amplitude damping channel;quantum discord;quantum capacity;mathematics;geometry;quantum channel;upper and lower bounds;quantum computer;matrix decomposition;classical capacity;quantum process;channel capacity;quantum algorithm;holevo's theorem;bregman divergence	Theory	44.75570786899355	16.586643531872834	51385

A DTDS is chaotic according to the Devaney’s definition of chaos iff it is topologically transitive, has dense periodic orbits, and it is sensitive to initial conditions. A DTDS is chaotic according to the Knudsen’s definition of chaos iff it has a dense orbit and it is sensitive to initial conditions. We continue the work initiated in [3], [4], [5], and [14] by proving that an easy-to-check property of local rules on which cellular automata are defined–introduced by Hedlund in [11] and called permutivity–is a sufficient condition for chaotic behavior. Permutivity turns out to be also a necessary condition for chaos in the case of elementary cellular automata while this is not true for general 1-dimensional cellular automata. The main technical contribution of this paper is the proof that permutivity of the local rule either in the leftmost or in the rightmost variable forces the cellular automaton to have dense periodic orbits.	automata theory;chaos theory;dynamical system;elementary cellular automaton;initial condition;mixing (mathematics)	Gianpiero Cattaneo;Luciano Margara	1998		10.1007/BFb0055833	stochastic cellular automaton;cellular automaton;discrete mathematics;continuous spatial automaton;computer science;dynamical system;mathematics;mobile automaton;algorithm	Theory	39.34996151718956	9.398420266067316	51579

In this paper, we study the probability density function of the sensor signals and demonstrate that the distribution is not Gaussian. We propose to employ the Gaussianity test based on the bootstrap algorithm to quantify the departure of Gaussianity for the received signals added with different kinds of noise. Our proposed Gaussianity test can be used as the robustness figure for evaluating the prevalent ML source localization schemes.	algorithm;bispectrum;bootstrapping (statistics);mixture model	Kun Yan;Hsiao-Chun Wu;S.

We assume direction dependent gain and phase errors which need to be estimated and calibrated out. Combining the subspace fitting and least square approaches, the signal subspace of the received single short-term interval (STI) sample data of the LOFAR is used to build a cost function whose minimizer is a statistically efficient estimator of the unknown parameters-the gains and phases of the telescopes. Subsequently, an iterative algorithm for finding the minimum of the cost function is presented and the unknown calibration parameters of both the core stations and the external subarray are separated. As a result, the computational complexity of the proposed method is significantly reduced compared to the existing methods based on a direct covariance fitting. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is compared with the conventional peeling method in computer simulation. An example for calibrating the core of the LOFAR array on Cyg A is also provided.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;iterative method;loss function;signal subspace	Yuntao Wu;Amir Leshem;Stefan J.

We consider the role of entropy in defining a conservative fusion rule. Finally, we investigate the geometric mean density (GMD) as a particular fusion rule, which generalises the Covariance Intersection rule to non-Gaussian pdfs. We derive key properties to demonstrate that the GMD is both conservative and effective in combining information from dependent sources.	covariance intersection;dependent source;entropy (information theory);general material designation;golm metabolome database;information processing	Tim Bailey;Simon J.

At first stage researches were performed by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for two kindu0027s random signals: first order autoregression (AR) and moving averaging (MA). Comparison of theoretical values of effective number of observations and determined by the runs test showed a good their convergence (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). This convergence increased when for AR signal level of autocorrelation decreased and for MA signal number of observation increased. To verify simulation results the runs test was used to analyses of random signal of known exponential autocorrelation function (exp (−i/f s ·τ f )) on output of first order RC low pass filter of time constant τ f and different sample frequencies f s .

In such context, a regularity model on the unknown is needed to obtain recovery guarantees. We show that we can guarantee the recovery of generic models (cones) with the minimization of an arbitrary regularizer subject to a data-fit constraint (generalized robust basis pursuit) under a restricted isometry property (RIP) hypothesis on the observations. In the classical cases of sparse vectors and low rank matrix recovery, our framework yields sharp recovery guarantees. For the more refined model of structured sparsity in levels, our framework extends and improves existing RIP recovery guarantees.	basis pursuit;detection theory;restricted isometry property;sparse matrix;unified framework	Yann Traonmilin;Rémi Gribonval	2016	2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)	10.1109/ITW.2016.7606815	mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics	ML	48.30344624843645	8.880040170393498	52713

This leads to a description of a walk of random geometric length as a Poisson point process of excursions away from its concave majorant, which is then used to find a complete description of the concave majorant of a walk of infinite length. In the case where subsets of increments may have the same arithmetic mean, we investigate three nested compositions that naturally arise from our construction of the concave majorant.	concave function	Josh Abramson;Jim Pitman	2011	Combinatorics, Probability & Computing	10.1017/S0963548311000307	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;poisson point process;poisson process;arithmetic mean;mathematics;random walk;statistics	Theory	39.831824877897326	16.619290225942088	52720

The premises or attributes, which we must take into consideration, are random variables, therefore we often have to deal with a high dimensional multivariate random vector. A multivariate random vector can be represented graphically as a Markov network. Usually the structure of the Markov network is unknown. In this paper we construct special type of junction trees, in order to obtain good approximations of the real probability distribution. These junction trees are capable of revealing some of the conditional independences of the network. We have already introduced the concept of the t-cherry junction tree (E. Kovacs and T. Szantai in Proceedings of the IFIP/IIASA//GAMM Workshop on Coping with Uncertainty, 2010 ), based on the t-cherry tree graph structure. This approximation uses only two and three dimensional marginal probability distributions. Now we use k-th order t-cherry trees, also called simplex multitrees to introduce the concept of the k-th order t-cherry junction tree. We prove that the k-th order t-cherry junction tree gives the best approximation among the family of k-width junction trees. Then we give a method which starting from a k-th order t-cherry junction tree constructs a (k+1)-th order t-cherry junction tree which gives at least as good approximation. In the last part we present some numerical results and some possible applications.

In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the number of noncoherent narrowband signals and that of coherent narrowband signals with multiple groups impinging on a planar sensor array composed of two parallel uniform linear arrays (ULAs), and an oblique projection based enumerator for the mixed signals (OPEMS) is proposed by utilizing the QR decomposition based ratio criterion (QRRC) for rank determination of a matrix. In the OPEMS, the number of noncoherent signals and that of coherent signals in each group are estimated separately, where only the elevation angles of noncoherent signals are estimated to isolate the coherent signals from the noncoherent ones, and the computationally intensive and time-consuming eigendecomposition procedure is avoided. The consistency of the proposed OPEMS is analyzed, and its effectiveness is verified through numerical examples.	coherent;enumerator polynomial;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;oblique projection;qr decomposition;sensor;software propagation	Hao Tao;Jingmin Xin;Jiasong Wang;Nanning Zheng;Akira Sano	2016	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2016.2548994	estimation;mathematics;azimuth;statistics	ML	52.448253646195596	7.677665880722211	52844
5cfc999c843f6bcef06d1e059904587490cd91eb	extensible grids: uniform sampling on a space-filling curve	van der corput sequence	We study the properties of points in [0, 1]d generated by applying Hilbert’s space-filling curve to uniformly distributed points in [0, 1]. For deterministic sampling we obtain a discrepancy of O(n−1/d) for d ≥ 2. For random stratified sampling, and scrambled van der Corput points, we get a mean squared error of O(n−1−2/d) for integration of Lipshitz continuous integrands, when d ≥ 3. These rates are the same as one gets by sampling on d dimensional grids and they show a deterioration with increasing d. The rate for Lipshitz functions is however best possible at that level of smoothness and is better than plain IID sampling. Unlike grids, space-filling curve sampling provides points at any desired sample size, and the van der Corput version is extensible in n. Additionally we show that certain discontinuous functions with infinite variation in the sense of Hardy and Krause can be integrated with a mean squared error of O(n−1−1/d). It was previously known only that the rate was o(n−1). Other space-filling curves, such as those due to Sierpinski and Peano, also attain these rates, while upper bounds for the Lebesgue curve are somewhat worse, as if the dimension were log2(3) times as high.	discrepancy function;mean squared error;sampling (signal processing);space-filling curve;stratified sampling	Zhijian He;Art B.

f8558ca18ffc6549c13358aa5a5e06621fdb7675	stochastic epidemic type model for analyzing seismic activity.		In statistical seismology, we can use stochastic process to explain random natural phenomena. One area of study in stochastic processes is point process. At a point process, earthquakes are viewed as a collection of random points in a space, where each point represents the time or/and location of an earthquake. In stochastic epidemic type model earthquake occurrence is assumed as an epidemic, i.e. a large earthquake triggers aftershocks at a certain time interval and the impact may extend to a region. By using point process approach, a stochastic model can be presented with its conditional intensity function, that is the probability of earthquake occurrence per time unit. It is expected that the analysis on the conditional intensity function of the epidemic type model provides information about the probability of earthquake occurrence based on its history. We apply the model to analyze seismic activity in Java Island, Indonesia.		Hasih Pratiwi;Dody Chandra Priambodo;Respatiwulan;I.

42d4af803db4a3f4edc5d5d7bbe6347bcf9c7d13	submodular sparse sensing for gaussian detection with correlated observations		Detection of a signal under noise is a classical signal processing problem. When monitoring spatial phenomena under a fixed budget, i.e., either physical, economical, or computational constraints, the selection of a subset of available sensors, referred to as sparse sensing, that meets both the budget and performance requirements is highly desirable. Unfortunately, the subset selection problem for detection under dependent observations is combinatorial in nature, and suboptimal subset selection algorithms must be employed. In this work, different from the widely used convex relaxation of the problem, we leverage submodularity, the diminishing returns property, to provide practical algorithms suitable for large-scale subset selection. This is achieved by means of low-complexity greedy algorithms, which incur a reduced computational complexity compared to their convex counterparts.	computational complexity theory;greedy algorithm;linear programming relaxation;requirement;selection algorithm;sensor;signal processing;sparse matrix;spatial analysis;submodular set function	Mario Coutino;Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri;Geert Leus	2018	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2018.2846220	mathematical optimization;task analysis;radar imaging;measurement uncertainty;submodular set function;computational complexity theory;signal processing;mathematics;greedy algorithm;gaussian	ML	46.995898503925865	5.607318987773335	53231

The underlying measure P is a weak solution to a martingale problem with continuous coefficients. Our representation is in the form of an integral with respect to its infinitesimal generator. This representation is of use in statistical inference (particularly involving medical imaging). Since R(μ||P ) governs the exponential rate of convergence of the empirical measure (according to Sanov’s theorem), this representation is also of use in the numerical and analytical investigation of finite-size effects in systems of interacting diffusions.	coefficient;interaction;kullback–leibler divergence;medical imaging;numerical analysis;rate of convergence;time complexity	Olivier Faugeras;James MacLaurin	2014	Entropy	10.3390/e16126705	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;mathematics;kullback–leibler divergence;physics;statistics	AI	44.496470993579905	12.78446747343486	53735

We construct a channel whose input is statistically independent of its output, but through which communication is nevertheless possible if and only if Tsirelson’s bound is violated. This provides a statistical justification for Tsirelson’s bound on nonlocal correlations in a bipartite setting.	quantum mechanics;quantum nonlocality;tsirelson's bound	Avishy Carmi;Daniel Moskovich	2018	Entropy	10.3390/e20030151		Theory	41.118149459156896	16.545836537796248	53752
74c4a39cca38ee5848459456d6eb5dd7717fd114	statistical complexity of the power method for markov chains	power method;statistical complexity;markov chain	Recently, attention has been focused on the statistical behavior of some of the classical algorithms of numerical and combinatorial analysis. For recent examples, see the work of Smale and others cited in the references. In his thesis, E. Kostlan (1985, “Statistical Complexity of Numerical Linear Algebra,” Thesis, University of California, Berkeley) showed that the average time for convergence of the squaring algorithm of numerical analysis for finding dominant ϵ-eigenvectors of n × n real symmetric and Hermitian matrices is O(log (n − log ϵ)), 0 < ϵ < 1, the average being taken over Gaussian ensembles of such matrices. We prove a complementary result for ensembles of n × n stochastic matrices, to the effect that for a large class of measures, (1 + σ) log (n) + log (− log ϵ) + O(1) iterations suffice with probability 1 − n−σ, where σ is an arbitrary positive constant. This result has a direct translation which says that with asymptotically rare exceptions, Markov chains of size n require roughly at most O(n2) steps to reach equilibrium as n tends to ∞.	markov chain;power iteration	Paul E.

The MP method has advantages over the conventional subspace-based algorithms such as MUSIC and ESPRIT. For example, the MP method does not require multiple snapshots and spatial smoothing but rather a single snapshot observation to estimate DOAs. Hence, it is attractive for real-time applications. However, the MP method can estimate DOAs from up to N/2 number of coherent sources when N antenna elements are used. This paper proposes a modified MP method, which can estimate up to (N-l) coherent source DOAs and, furthermore, can improve performance of the MP algorithm significantly.	coherence (physics);data point;delphi method;direction of arrival;horner's method;map;real-time clock;simulation;smoothing;snapshot (computer storage);toeplitz hash algorithm	Nizar Tayem;Amjad Salameh;Hyuck M.

The problem addressed is that of identifying and inverting the mixture, which obviously does not admit a linear inverse. Identification is carried out with the help of tensor canonical decompositions. On the other hand, the discrete distribution of the sources is utilized for performing the source extraction, the under-determined mixture being either known or unknown. The results presented in this paper are limited to 2-dimensional mixtures of 3 sources.

Important properties of the model are derived and used for developing new parameter estimation algorithms and for constructing an optimum noise reduction filter. In particular, a novel iterative maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm is proposed for estimating the parameters of the model from a sample image, and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed for estimating the signal and noise variances given a noisy image. The optimal Wiener filter is derived making use of the parametric form of the model for the noise reduction under additive white Gaussian noise (WGN). Also the theoretic performance of the filter is obtained and its behavior is analyzed in terms of the long-correlation feature of the model. The effectiveness of the presented algorithms is demonstrated through experimental results on synthetic generated GRFs. An application to the restoration of cosmic microwave background (CMB) images in the presence of additive WGN is also presented.	estimation theory;noise reduction	Cesar F. Caiafa;Araceli N.

The saddlepoint solution \phi^{0} uses an equaUy likely mixed strategy to chose one of N Bayesian single-threshold decision rules \phi_{i}^{0}, i = 1,\cdots , N having been obtained previously by the author. These decision rules are also all optimal against the maximin (least-favorable) nonrandomized noise probability density f_{0} , where f_{0} is a picket fence function with N pickets on its domain. Thee pair (\phi^{0}, f_{0}) is shown to satisfy the saddlepoint condition for probability of error, i.e., P_{e}(\phi^{0} , f) \leq P_{e}(\phi^{0} , f_{0}) \leq P_{e}(\phi, f_{0}) holds for all f and \phi . The decision rule \phi^{0} is also shown to be an eqoaliir rule, i.e., P_{e}(\phi^{0}, f ) = P_{e}(\phi^{0},f_{0}) , for all f , with 4^{-1} \leq P_{e}(\phi^{0},f_{0})=2^{-1}(1-N^{-1})\leq2^{-1} , N \geq 2 . Thus nature can force the communicator to use an {\em optimal} randomized decision rule that generates a large probability of error and does not improve when less pernicious conditions prevail.	interference (communication);randomized algorithm;utility functions on indivisible goods	Joel M.

The posterior density of the phase drift is propagated in a recursive fashion by implementing a prediction and a filtering step in each iteration. The prediction step is supported on a random walk model playing the role of prior for the phase drift process; the filtering step is supported on a Gaussian sum approximation for the probability density of the current observation, i.e., the so-called sensor factor. The Gaussian sum approximation turns out to be the key element allowing to derive a fast and efficient stochastic filter, which otherwise would be very hard to compute. The detection of the digital symbols is then carried out based on the inferred statistics of the phase drift. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated for BPSK signals in the presence of strong phase drift.	algorithm;ampersand;approximation;carrier frequency offset;channel state information;iteration;recursion (computer science);scheme;simulation;stochastic control;weight function	Pedro Pedrosa;Rui Dinis;Fernando Duarte Nunes;Jos&#x00E9; M.

f56efce520230639b5212767e5f75245d6dff231	optimality of operator-like wavelets for representing sparse ar(1) processes		The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is known to be asymptotically equivalent to the Karhunen-Loève transform (KLT) of Gaussian first-order auto-regressive (AR(1)) processes. Since being uncorrelated under the Gaussian hypothesis is synonymous with independence, it also yields an independent-component analysis (ICA) of such signals. In this paper, we present a constructive non-Gaussian generalization of this result: the characterization of the optimal orthogonal transform (ICA) for the family of symmetric-stable AR(1) processes. The degree of sparsity of these processes is controlled by the stability parameter 0 <; α ≤ 2 with the only non-sparse member of the family being the classical Gaussian AR(1) process with α = 2. Specifically, we prove that, for α <; 2, a fixed family of operator-like wavelet bases systematically outperforms the DCT in terms of compression and denoising ability. The effect is quantified with the help of two performance criteria (one based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and the other on Stein's formula for the minimum estimation error) that can also be viewed as statistical measures of independence. Finally, we observe that, for the sparser kind of processes with 0 <; α ≤ 1, the operator-like wavelet basis, as dictated by linear system theory, is undistinguishable from the ICA solution obtained through numerical optimization. Our framework offers a unified view that encompasses sinusoidal transforms such as the DCT and a family of orthogonal Haar-like wavelets that is linked analytically to the underlying signal model.	autoregressive model;discrete cosine transform;first-order predicate;haar wavelet;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;kullback–leibler divergence;linear system;mathematical optimization;noise reduction;numerical analysis;sparse matrix;systems theory	Pedram Pad;Michael Unser	2015	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2015.2447494	wavelet;independent component analysis;stochastic process;mathematical optimization;harmonic wavelet transform;second-generation wavelet transform;continuous wavelet transform;computer science;noise;pattern recognition;noise reduction;mathematics;wavelet packet decomposition;stationary wavelet transform;discrete wavelet transform;lifting scheme;statistics;wavelet transform	ML	51.640088994931304	14.820618972729775	57325

The latter are elegant and comprehensive Radon operations which can solve complex multidimensional problems by transforming them to a suitable unidimensional setting, where analysis is considerably simpler. It is shown that spatial correlation functions in R/sup n/ are uniquely determined by means of their space transformations in R/sup 1/. Necessary and sufficient conditions are established in order that a spatial random field (in R/sup n/) be represented as the linear combination of pairwise uncorrelated random processes (in R/sup 1/). Space transformations provide analytically tractable criteria for testing the permissibility of correlation functions and constitute an attractive instrument for spatial and spatiotemporal random field simulation and for studying stochastic partial differential equations.

The derivation of equation for calculating the efficiency indices is based on the assumption that the time of problem solution on CS is a function of time of problem solution on one elementary machine, and the function has a finite number of discontinuities. The discontinuities have the probabilistic character and correspond to the CS failures that require reconfiguration of the CS (structure readjustability with regard to working machine only). A notion of complex CS reconfiguration is introduced and the reconfiguration is investigated.

Two binary tests are considered, depending on which assumptions is retained as the null hypothesis. Assuming th at the signal is a linear combination of the solution of a multidimensional stochastic differential eq uation (SDE), it is shown that the minimum Type II error probability decreases exponentially in the number of samples when the False Alarm probability is fixed. This behavior is described by error exponentsthat are completely characterized. It turns out that they are related with the asymptotic behavior of the Kalman F ilter in random stationary environment, which is studied in this paper. Finally, numerical illustra tions of our claims are provided in the context of sensor networks.	additive white gaussian noise;illustra;kalman filter;numerical analysis;stationary process;stochastic process;utility functions on indivisible goods	Walid Hachem;Eric Moulines;François Roueff	2009	CoRR			Theory	48.42517406834915	12.305132399190024	58301

b5a1eaff6c1b6ed9a332c2cf6c5353a5ed3a44f8	square hellinger subadditivity for bayesian networks and its applications to identity testing		We show that the square Hellinger distance between two Bayesian networks on the same directed graph, G, is subadditive with respect to the neighborhoods of G. Namely, if P and Q are the probability distributions defined by two Bayesian networks on the same DAG, our inequality states that the square Hellinger distance, H(P,Q), between P and Q is upper bounded by the sum, ∑ v H (P{v}∪Πv , Q{v}∪Πv), of the square Hellinger distances between the marginals of P and Q on every node v and its parents Πv in the DAG. Importantly, our bound does not involve the conditionals but the marginals of P and Q. We derive a similar inequality for more general Markov Random Fields. As an application of our inequality, we show that distinguishing whether two Bayesian networks P and Q on the same (but potentially unknown) DAG satisfy P = Q vs dTV(P,Q) > ǫ can be performed from Õ(|Σ|3/4(d+1) · n/ǫ) samples, where d is the maximum in-degree of the DAG and Σ the domain of each variable of the Bayesian networks. If P and Q are defined on potentially different and potentially unknown trees, the sample complexity becomes Õ(|Σ|4.5n/ǫ2), whose dependence on n, ǫ is optimal up to logarithmic factors. Lastly, if P and Q are product distributions over {0, 1}n and Q is known, the sample complexity becomes O(√n/ǫ2), which is optimal up to constant factors.	bayesian network;directed graph;markov chain;markov random field;sample complexity;social inequality	Constantinos Daskalakis;Qinxuan Pan	2017			combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;statistics	ML	40.24837731955775	15.623561116190173	58448

Second, we provide explicit expressions for the probability generating functions of both the waiting time until the first occurrence, and the interarrival time between consecutive occurrences, of a structured motif. Distributional results for structured motifs are of interest in genome analysis because such motifs are promoter candidates.

14a14450bb5f932f276c054c4b406b267b2a4853	forward reachable sets: analytically derived properties of connected components for dynamic networks		Formal analysis of the emergent structural properties of dynamic networks is largely uncharted territory. We focus here on the properties of forward reachable sets (FRS) as a function of the underlying degree distribution and edge duration. FRS are defined as the set of nodes that can be reached from an initial seed via a path of temporally ordered edges; a natural extension of connected component measures to dynamic networks. Working in a stochastic framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the exponential growth rate of the FRS for temporal networks with both edge and node dynamics. For networks with node dynamics, we calculate thresholds for the growth of the FRS. The effects of finite population size are explored via simulation and approximation. We examine how these properties vary by edge duration and different cross-sectional degree distributions that characterize a range of scientifically interesting normative outcomes (Poisson and Bernoulli). The size of the forward reachable set gives an upper bound for the epidemic size in disease transmission network models, relating this work to epidemic modeling (Ferguson 2000, Eames 2004).	approximation;bernoulli polynomials;connected component (graph theory);cross-sectional data;degree distribution;emergence;simulation;time complexity	Benjamin Armbruster;Li Wang;Martina Morris	2017	Network Science	10.1017/nws.2017.10	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics;statistics	ML	41.85150817362826	9.066883349693521	59449

The property of the vector sensor array is employed to solve the problem of insufficient rank from signal coherence. The L-shaped uniform array of expend aperture is used to improve the precision of estimation, and the method of solving the ambiguity of angle under the condition of coherent signals is presented. The performance of this algorithm is compared with that of spatial smoothing method to verify the efficacy of this approach.	algorithm;chirp;coherence (physics);direction of arrival;estimation theory;fractional fourier transform;polarization (waves);smoothing	Zhong Wen;LiPing Li;TianQi Chen;Xixiang Zhang	2008	Science in China Series F: Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-008-0002-8	covariance matrix;coherence;fractional fourier transform;mathematics;estimation theory;direction of arrival;sensor array;statistics	EDA	52.397464059327696	7.336836148153311	59715
6a73b7dbc1fb46a5c100e016eb8a48db5b0ac4ea	optimal detection and error exponents for hidden semi-markov models		We study detection of random signals corrupted by noise that over time switch their values (states) between a finite set of possible values, where the switchings occur at unknown points in time. We model such signals as hidden semi-Markov signals, which generalize classical Markov chains by introducing explicit (possibly nongeometric) distribution for the time spent in each state. Assuming two possible signal states and Gaussian noise, we derive optimal likelihood ratio test and show that it has a computationally tractable form of a matrix product, with the number of matrices involved in the product being the number of process observations. The product matrices are independent and identically distributed, constructed by a simple measurement modulation of the sparse semi-Markov model transition matrix that we define in the paper. Using this result, we show that the Neyman–Pearson error exponent is equal to the top Lyapunov exponent for the corresponding random matrices. Using theory of large deviations, we derive a lower bound on the error exponent. Finally, we show that this bound is tight by means of numerical simulations.

The first design paradigm is optimized for collection of measurements at multiple wavelengths, fusing these together for joint inference over an underlying scene. The second design paradigm is robust, in a sense that it is guaranteed to allow good inference over the scene at any one single wavelength at a time. We quantify inference quality via the D-Bayes optimality criterion and limit the design space by restricting the number of allowed sensors and the positions where these can be placed. We show that the resulting combinatorial optimization problems are instances of problems in a class known to have efficient guaranteed approximation algorithms, namely submodular optimization problems, and showcase the design of arrays under both paradigms utilizing simple greedy selection algorithms, and state-of-the-art robust submodular maximization algorithms.	approximation algorithm;combinatorial optimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;greedy algorithm;mathematical optimization;naive bayes classifier;optimality criterion;programming paradigm;robustness (computer science);sensor;submodular set function	Gal Shulkind;Stefanie Jegelka;Gregory W.

Asymptotically optimal procedures for two scenarios are presented. In the first scenario, the sensors send quantized versions of their observations to a fusion center where change detection is performed based on all the sensor messages. If in particular, the quantizers are binary, then the proposed binary CUSUM detection test is optimal in the class of tests with binary quantized data. In the second scenario, the sensors perform local change detection using the CUSUM procedures and send their final decisions to the fusion center for combining. The decision in favor of the change occurrence is made whenever CUSUM statistics at all sensors exceed thresholds. The latter decentralized procedure has the same first order asymptotic (as the false alarm rate is low) minimax operating characteristics as the globally optimal centralized detection procedure that has access to all the sensor observations. However, the presented Monte Carlo experiments for the Poisson example show that despite the fact that the procedure with local decisions is globally asymptotically optimal for a low false alarm rate, it performs worse than the procedure with binary quantization unless the false alarm rate is extremely low. In addition, two voting-type local decision based detection procedures are proposed and evaluated.

If the walker can restart the walk at x at will, then the minimum expected hitting time γ(x, 0) (minimized over restarting strategies) is finite; it was called the “grade” of x by Dumitriu, Tetali and Winkler. They showed that, in a more general setting, the grade (a variant of the “Gittins index”) plays a crucial role in control problems involving several Markov chains. Here we establish several conjectures of Dumitriu et al on the asymptotics of the grade in Euclidean lattices. In particular, we show that in the planar square lattice, γ(x, 0) is asymptotic to 2|x| log |x| as |x| → ∞. The proof hinges on the local variance of the potential kernel being almost constant on the level sets of h. We also show how the same method yields precise second order asymptotics for hitting times of a random walk (without restarts) in a lattice disk.	amiga walker;markov chain;random walker algorithm	Svante Janson;Yuval Peres	2012	SIAM J.

Here we provide a fundamental characterisation that connects structural properties of a network to its dynamical features. Specifically, we define the notion of ‘stochastically complex balanced systems’ in terms of the network’s stationary distribution and provide a characterisation of stochastically complex balanced systems, parallel to that established in the 70-80ies for deterministic reaction networks. Additionally, we establish that a network is stochastically complex balanced if and only if an associated deterministic network is complex balanced (in the deterministic sense), thereby proving a strong link between the theory of stochastic and deterministic networks. Further, we prove a stochastic version of the ‘deficiency zero theorem’ and show that any (not only complex balanced) deficiency zero reaction network has a product-form Poisson-like stationary distribution on all irreducible components. Finally, we provide sufficient conditions for when a product-form Poisson-like distribution on a single (or all) component(s) implies the network is complex balanced, and explore the possibility to characterise complex balanced systems in terms of product-form Poisson-like stationary distributions.	angular defect;dynamical system;irreducibility;markov chain;stationary process	Daniele Cappelletti;Carsten Wiuf	2016	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/15M1029916	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;stationary distribution;discrete mathematics;mathematics;markov process;statistics	ML	42.10342052135276	8.523399778479877	61144

In this paper, we present some of the most frequently used definitions of the ambiguity domain in discrete time: the Claasen-Mecklenbrauker, the Jeong-Williams, and the Nuttall definitions.

We first divide the URA into a number of row rectangular subarrays. Then, by extracting all the data information of each subarray, we only perform difference-operation on the auto-correlations, while the cross-correlations are kept unchanged. Using the reconstructed submatrices, both the forward only ISD (FO-ISD) and forward backward ISD (FB-ISD) methods are developed under the proposed scheme. Compared with the existing spatial smoothing techniques, the proposed scheme can use more data information of the sample covariance matrix and also suppress the effect of additive noise more effectively. Simulation results show that both FO-ISD and FB-ISD can improve the estimation performance largely as compared to the others, in white or colored noise conditions.	atp5f1 gene;additive white gaussian noise;autoregressive integrated moving average;coded aperture;coherent;colors of noise;cross-correlation;direction of arrival;fb term type;fully buffered dimm;neuromuscular disease, congenital, with uniform type 1 fiber (disorder);renin activity measurement;simulation;smoothing (statistical technique);spatial processing;utility functions on indivisible goods	Junpeng Shi;Fenggang Sun;Binfeng Zong;Xin Wang	2017		10.3390/s17091956	electronic engineering;smoothing;engineering;colors of noise;mathematical optimization;sample mean and sample covariance;block matrix;direction of arrival	HPC	52.03839048514029	7.3506439978661815	61857

Using random matrix theory, we provide expressions for the moments of the eigenvalue distribution of the controllability Gramian. These moments can then be used to derive useful properties of the eigenvalue distribution of the Gramian (in some cases, even closed-form expressions for the distribution). We illustrate this framework by considering system matrices derived from common random graph and matrix ensembles, such as the Wigner ensemble, the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), and random regular graphs. Subsequently, we illustrate how the eigenvalue distribution of the Gramian can be used to draw conclusions about the energy required to control random system.	flow network;gaussian (software);gramian matrix;random graph;stochastic process	Victor M.

The switch of graph topology is modeled as an adapted stochastic process, which in principle can include any stochastic processes such as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) processes and Markov chains. We derive the sufficient conditions for consensus in both discrete-time and continuous-time networks in terms of conditional expectations of the underlying graph topology. We prove that if there exist $T>0$ and $\delta>0$ such that the conditional expectation of the union of the $\delta$-graph topologies across each $T$-length time interval has spanning trees, then the multiagent system reaches consensus. For comparison, we show that some previous results on this topic can be derived from our main theorem as corollaries. This includes important results when the switching topology can be modeled as the special and important stochastic models—the i.i.d. process and the Markov process—which implies that we generalize the previous results to some extent. As applications, we also give some corollaries concerning stochastic processes other than the i.i.d. process and Markov processes, such as independent but not necessarily identically distributed processes, hidden Markov models, and $\phi$-mixing processes.	agent-based model;stochastic process	Bo Liu;Wenlian Lu;Tianping Chen	2011	SIAM J.

Specifically, we derive mutual information-based upper bounds on the number of tests required to identify the required number of healthy items. Our results show that an impressive reduction in the number of tests is achievable compared to the conventional approach of using classical group testing to first identify the defective items and then pick the required number of healthy items from the complement set. For example, to identify L healthy items out of a population of N items containing K defective items, when the tests are reliable, our results show that O(K(L - 1)/(N - K)) measurements are sufficient. In contrast, the conventional approach requires O(K log(N/K)) measurements. We derive our results in a general sparse signal setup, and hence, they are applicable to other sparse signal-based applications such as compressive sensing also.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;cobham's thesis;compressed sensing;information theory;mutual information;population;sparse matrix;utility functions on indivisible goods	Abhay Sharma;Chandra Ramabhadra Murthy	2013	2013 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)	10.1109/ITA.2013.6502960	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;computer science;mathematics;compressed sensing;statistics	ML	46.91856496780909	10.290411339951591	62349

Specifically, our analysis studies compressed sensing matrices consisting of rows selected at random, without replacement, from a circulant matrix generated by a random subgaussian vector. We quantize the measurements using stable, possibly one-bit, Sigma-Delta schemes, and use a reconstruction method based on convex optimization. We show that the part of the reconstruction error due to quantization decays polynomially in the number of measurements. This is in-line with analogous results on Sigma-Delta quantization associated with random Gaussian or subgaussian matrices, and significantly better than results associated with the widely assumed memoryless scalar quantization.	circulant matrix;compressed sensing;convex optimization;delta-sigma modulation;mathematical optimization;quantization (signal processing)	Joe-Mei Feng;Felix Krahmer;Rayan Saab	2017	2017 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)		restricted isometry property	Robotics	48.35323725654607	9.616210847259469	62424
60a16fa8a83afc8012a9d9e854dfdb5caed1d6da	doa estimation with planar array via spatial finite rate of innovation reconstruction		Abstract Recently, a new DOA estimation algorithm called FRIDA was proposed. It is based on spatial finite rate of innovation (FRI) reconstruction and exhibits some attractive features. In this paper, we propose a variation of FRIDA which is called FRIDA-V (suffix “-V” means variation) . FRIDA-V improves FRIDA in three aspects. Firstly, a multiple measurement vectors (MMV) spatial FRI model is built in the direct data domain rather than the covariance domain, which avoids the model residual error in FRIDA and makes the new method capable of handling both incoherent and coherent sources. Secondly, the full column rank constraint on the mapping matrix is relaxed by adopting the pseudo-inverse technique, which makes it possible to reduce the Bessel function approximation error to a negligible level. Thirdly, the multiple random initializations in the iterative calculations are replaced by a single straightforward initialization, which will speed up the convergence to the optimal solution and save the computational resource. Theoretical derivations and numerical simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the representative methods, the new method is gridless and possesses higher performance with closely-spaced sources and under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), small number of snapshots scenarios.	direction of arrival	Yujian Pan;Guo Qing Luo;Huayan Jin;Xiao Hong Zhang;Chuan Yin	2018	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2018.07.001	control theory;mathematics;residual;mathematical optimization;initialization;covariance;data domain;small number;computational resource;approximation error;matrix (mathematics)	Arch	52.89605697433722	6.914014770403079	63065

Assuming that the robots have limited, range-based communication and target-sensing capabilities, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for ensuring distance optimality when robots and targets are uniformly randomly distributed. We then provide an explicit, non-asymptotic formula for computing the number of robots needed for guaranteeing optimality in terms of the robots' sensing and communication capabilities with arbitrarily high probabilities. The bound given in the formula is also asymptotically tight. Due to the large number of robots needed for high-probability optimality guarantee, we continue to investigate strategies for cases in which the number of robots cannot be freely chosen. We show that a properly designed strategy can be asymptotically optimal or suboptimal with constant approximation ratios.	approximation algorithm;assignment problem;asymptotically optimal algorithm;centralized computing;computation;mobile robot;performance;randomness	Jingjin Yu;Soon-Jo Chung;Petros G.

The classical linearity least-squares estimation is linearity unbiased and its variance identity.

The denseness of the class GH with respect to the class of all CDFs defined on [0, ∞) is established by showing that a GH distribution can be found that is as close to a given CDF as desired, with respect to a suitably defined metric. The metric induces the usual topology of weak convergence so that, equivalently, there exists a sequence of GH CDFs that converges weakly to a given CDF. This result is established by using a similar result for weak convergence of Erlang mixtures. Various set inclusion relations are also obtained relating the GH distributions to other commonly used classes of approximating distributions, including generalized Erlang (GE), mixed generalized Erlang (MGE), those with reciprocal polynomial Laplace transforms (Kn), those with rational Laplace transforms (Rn), and phase-type (PH) distributions.

In this context, assuming N available noisy measurements, lower bounds on the Bayesian Mean Square Error (BMSE) for the estimated entries of a sparse amplitude vector are derived in the proposed work for (i) a Gaussian overcomplete measurement matrix and (ii) for a random support, assuming that each entry is modeled as the product of a continuous random variable and a Bernoulli random variable indicating that the current entry is non-zero with probability P. A closed-form expression of the Expected CRB (ECRB) is proposed. In the second part, the BMSE of the Linear Minimum MSE (LMMSE) estimator is derived and it is proved that the LMMSE estimator tends to be statistically efficient in asymptotic conditions, i.e., if product (1 - P)2 SNR is maximized. This means that in the context of the Gaussian CS problem, the LMMSE estimator gathers together optimality in the low noise variance regime and a simple derivation (as opposed to the derivation of the MMSE estimator). This result is original because the LMMSE estimator is generally sub-optimal for CS when the measurement matrix is a single realization of a given random process.	bernoulli polynomials;compressed sensing;mean squared error;signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix;stochastic process	Rémy Boyer;Pascal Larzabal;Bernard Henri Fleury	2016	2016 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)	10.1109/SSP.2016.7551780	minimum mean square error;mathematical optimization;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	ML	49.82997230445294	10.0060664884411	64168

This situation is encountered in slow frequency-hopped spread spectrum systems with partial time or partial band jamming. It has deleterious effects on the receiver performance, at least when a single antenna is used. We consider using an array of sensors to mitigate the effects of such an interference. The influence of the latter on the signal and jammer DOA estimates is studied. A general setup is introduced, and two different models are derived, depending on whether the jammer's presence indicators are considered deterministic or random. In both cases, the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) are derived, and a numerical study of the CRB provides insights into the influence of the jammer's parameters. Additionally, it is shown that conventional methods such as ESPRIT can provide fairly accurate DOA estimates for this type of interference.	direction finding;interference (communication)	Olivier Besson;Petre Stoica;Yukihiro Kamiya	2002	IEEE Trans.

To do so, we relate the exact distribution of the sum of independent discrete uniform random variables to the asymptotic distribution, obtained from the Central Limit Theorem and a local limit variant. 1 Stirling’s formula and central binomial coefficients For a nonnegative integer k, Stirling’s formula k! ∼ √ 2πk ( k e k where e is Euler’s number, yields an approximation of the central binomial coefficient ( k k/2 ) using ( k m ) = k! m!(k−m)! as ( k k/2 ) ∼ 2 k+1 √ 2πk , where we write ak ∼ bk as short-hand for limk→∞ ak bk = 1. In our current note, we derive asymptotic formulas for central extended binomial, or polynomial, coefficients (cf. [2, 3, 7]). These coefficients appear in the extended binomial triangles (which we also call (l+ 1)-nomial, polynomial, or multinomial triangles [8]), which are generalizations of binomial, or Pascal, triangles, in which entries in row k are defined as coefficients of the polynomial (1+x+x2+ · · ·+xl)k for l ≥ 0. Our derivation is not based upon asymptotics of factorials, but upon the limiting distribution of the sum of discrete uniform random variables.1 2 Extended binomial triangles In generalization to binomial triangles, (l+1)-nomial triangles, for l ≥ 0, are defined in the following way. Starting with a 1 in row zero, construct an entry in row k, for k ≥ 1, by adding the overlying (l+ 1) entries in row (k − 1) (some of these entries are taken as zero if not defined); thereby, row k has (kl + 1) entries. For example, the binomial (l = 1), trinomial (l = 2), and quadrinomial triangles (l = 3) start as follows, Throughout, we assume that all fractional values such as x = kl 2 are integral when used in the context of extended binomial coefficients. If this is not the case, then replace respective quantities with their floor, ⌊x⌋, the largest integer less than or equal to x.	approximation;coefficient;euler;extended precision;multinomial logistic regression;pascal;polynomial;trinomial	Steffen Eger	2014	The American Mathematical Monthly	10.4169/amer.math.monthly.121.04.344	central binomial coefficient;binomial series;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;binomial approximation;binomial distribution;coefficient;gaussian binomial coefficient;mathematics;multinomial theorem;negative binomial distribution;binomial coefficient	Theory	43.042444924320144	14.614706365948978	65966

Even though the basic construction of a cellular automaton is a discrete model, its macroscopic behavior at large evolution times and on large spatial scales can be a close approximation to a continuous system. Beyond some statistical properties, we consider geometrical and visual aspects of patterns generated by CA evolution. The present work focuses on the theory of two-dimensional CA with respect to uniform periodic, adiabatic and reflexive boundary CA (2D PB, AB and RB) conditions. In total, there are 512 linear rules over the binary field ℤ2 for each boundary condition and the effects of these CA are studied on applications of image processing for self-replicating patterns. After establishing the representation matrices of 2D CA, these linear CA rules are classified into groups of nine and eight types according to their boundary conditions and the number of neighboring cells influencing the cells under consideration. All linear rules have been found to be rendering multiple self-replicating copies of a given image depending on these types. Multiple copies of any arbitrary image corresponding to CA find innumerable applications in real life situation, e.g. textile design, DNA genetics research, statistical physics, molecular self-assembly and artificial life, etc. We conclude by presenting a successful application for generating pseudo numbers to be used in cryptography by hybridization of these 2D CA subfamilies.	cellular automaton	Selman Uguz;Ugur Sahin;Hasan Akin;Irfan Siap	2014	I.

The proposed approach uses angles of arrivals (AOAs) and gain ratios of arrival (GROAs) measured simultaneously at each node to estimate the source position jointly. Compared to AOA-only localization methods, the GROAs can be used in conjunction with AOA measurements so as to get more accurate results by exploiting the geometrical relationship between these two measurements. Compared to time difference of arrival localization methods, the proposed algorithm does not require accurate time synchronization over different nodes. The theoretical mean-square error matrices of the proposed approach are derived and they are exactly equal to the Cramér-Rao bound for Gaussian noise under the small error condition. Simulations validate the performance of the proposed estimator.	ataxia, early-onset, with oculomotor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia;acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;anatomic node;angle of arrival;aoa <invertebrate>;cxcl1 wt allele;common language infrastructure;computer simulation;least squares;least-squares analysis;mean squared error;multilateration;normal statistical distribution	Ji-an Luo;Si-Wei Pan;Dongliang Peng;Zhi Wang;Yan-Jun Li	2018		10.3390/s18040937	estimator;wireless sensor network;electronic engineering;multilateration;matrix (mathematics);synchronization;engineering;gaussian noise;least squares;control theory;angle of arrival	Robotics	51.355841671774684	4.934087274423907	67575

Unlike many alternatives, PCCA does not require knowledge of the calibration data for the array, directions of arrival, training signals, or spatial autocorrelation matrices of the noise or interferers. A novel aspect of PCCA is the ease with which new algorithms, targeted at capturing all signals from particular classes of interest, can be developed within this framework. Several existing algorithms are unified within the PCCA framework, and new algorithms are derived as examples. Analysis for the infinite-collect case and simulation for the finite-collect case illustrate the operation of specific algorithms within the PCCA framework.		Stephan V. Schell;William A.

In a bivariate Markov chain {(Xt, Nt), t ≥ 0}, the values of the variable Xt are nodes of a binomial-like tree of order d, where the i-th child has i children of its own. We demonstrate that it suffices to solve d quadratic matrix equations to yield the steady state vector, the form of which is matrix geometric. We apply this framework to analyze the multilevel feedback scheduling discipline, which forms an essential part in contemporary operating systems.	algorithm;bivariate data;markov chain;operating system;programming paradigm;scheduling (computing);steady state;tree (data structure)	Benny Van Houdt;Jeroen Van Velthoven;Chris Blondia	2008	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-007-0288-8	matrix analytic method;markov chain;mathematical optimization;markov kernel;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;continuous-time markov chain;examples of markov chains;balance equation;mathematics;markov chain mixing time;rate of convergence;steady state;statistics;variable-order markov model	Theory	42.343922978694025	13.145133368457868	67830

7bd224c9c7926203628aae565af0eaa9cc75d5b1	2d doa estimation for coherent signals with acoustic vector-sensor array		In this paper, a fast ESPRIT algorithm is presented for two-dimensional (2D) direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of coherent signals with a linear acoustic vectorsensor array. Conventional space smoothing ESPRIT (SS-ESPRIT) algorithm for acoustic vector-sensor array has two obvious weak points: (1) eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of high-order covariance matrix; (2) frequently occurring parameters mismatch which leads to failed 2D DOA estimation. The proposed algorithm can remove the two shortcomings. Firstly, we use two selection matrices to separate received data and form a low-order crosscovariance matrix. Then, ESPRIT algorithm is used to estimate the elevation angles of incident signals. At last, using the estimated elevation angles, a modified array manifold matching method is used to estimate the azimuth angles of coherent signals. During the estimation process of azimuth angles, the proposed method is not required to perform any peak search or EVD. Moreover, azimuth angles are automatically matched with the estimated elevation angles. Compared with the conventional SS-ESPRIT algorithm, the proposed algorithm has lower complexity. However, the estimation accuracy of proposed method almost is the same as the conventional SS-ESPRIT algorithm and far better than & Lisheng Yang ylscqu2615@163.com Sheng Liu gzuliusheng@163.com Yuanju Xie 772927904@qq.com Yanhong Yin 1152414037@qq.com Qingping Jiang jqpchongqing@163.com 1 Big Data Institute, Tongren University, Tongren 554300, China 2 The Key Laboratory of Aerocraft Tracking Telemetering Command and Communication, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China 123 Wireless Pers Commun DOI 10.1007/s11277-016-3829-0 PM algorithm.

Exploring and utilizing the dynamic properties of molecular reactions, this paper proposes an easily understood but systematic method to solve law-of-total-probability-relevant problems within the realm of probability theory. The essence of our proposal could meanwhile be utilized to tackle problems with regard to Bayes' Theorem and Markov chains. Numerial results based on law of mass action have demonstrated and validated the robustness and accuracy of this method. It is worth noting that an already mathematically proven conclusion, which states that nearly an arbitrary set of bimolecular reactions can be implemented by DNA strand displacement reactions, ensures the meaningfulness of our work.	computation;displacement mapping;markov chain;mass action law (electronics);reduction (complexity);simulation;strand (programming language)	Ziyuan Shen;Chuan Zhang;Lulu Ge;Yuchen Zhuang;Bo Yuan;Xiaohu You	2016	2016 IEEE International Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)	10.1109/SiPS.2016.13	probability theory;markov chain;combinatorics;computer science;inductive probability;machine learning;mathematics;law of total probability;bayes' theorem;hammersley–clifford theorem;algorithm;statistics	Embedded	42.87814249056822	4.969038020562131	68886
3852fdc761bcfdd1ae87c90c910fbaae62d87f3d	optimal hypothesis testing for stochastic block models with growing degrees		The present paper considers testing an Erdős–Rényi random graph model against a stochastic block model in the asymptotic regime where the average degree of the graph grows to infinity with the graph size n. Our primary interest lies in those cases in which the signal-to-noise ratio is at a constant level. Focusing on symmetric two block alternatives, we first derive joint central limit theorems for linear spectral statistics of power functions for properly rescaled graph adjacency matrices under both the null and local alternative hypotheses. The powers in the linear spectral statistics can also grow to infinity together with the graph size. In addition, we show that linear spectral statistics of Chebyshev polynomials are closely connected to signed cycles of growing lengths that determine the asymptotic likelihood ratio test for the hypothesis testing problem. This enables us to construct a sequence of test statistics that achieves the exact optimal asymptotic power within O(n log n) time complexity in the contiguous regime when npn,av → ∞ where pn,av is the average connection probability. We further propose a class of adaptive tests that are computationally tractable and completely data-driven. They achieve nontrivial powers in the contiguous regime and consistency in the singular regime whenever npn,av →∞. These tests remain powerful when the alternative becomes a stochastic block model with more than two blocks.	adjacency matrix;chebyshev polynomials;cobham's thesis;erdős number;erdős–rényi model;polynomial;random graph;signal-to-noise ratio;stochastic block model;time complexity	Debapratim Banerjee;Zongming Ma	2017	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;statistics	ML	41.59052009385588	15.659777185939214	69126

When the dynamic range of the parameter is small or comparable with the noise variance, we introduce a class of maximum-likelihood estimators that require transmitting just one bit per sensor to achieve an estimation variance close to that of the (clairvoyant) sample mean estimator. When the dynamic range is comparable or larger than the noise standard deviation, we show that an optimum quantization step exists to achieve the best possible variance for a given bandwidth constraint. We will also establish that in certain cases the sample mean estimator formed by quantized observations is preferable for complexity reasons. We finally touch upon algorithm implementation issues and guarantee that all the numerical maximizations required by the proposed estimators are concave.	algorithm;concave function;dynamic range;estimation theory;internet access;numerical analysis;transmitter	Alejandro R.

A central unit having access to the data gathered by a dense network of low-precision sensors, is required to reconstruct the field snapshots to maximum accuracy. Both deterministic and stochastic field models are considered. For stochastic fields, results are established in the almost-sure sense. The feasibility of having a flexible tradeoff between the oversampling rate (sensor density) and the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) precision, while achieving an exponential accuracy in the number of bits per Nyquist-interval per snapshot is demonstrated. This exposes an underlying “conservation of bits” principle: the bit-budget per Nyquist-interval per snapshot (the rate) can be distributed along the amplitude axis (sensor-precision) and space (sensor density) in an almost arbitrary discrete-valued manner, while retaining the same (exponential) distortion-rate characteristics.	analog-to-digital converter;apache axis;bandlimiting;distortion;dynamic range;nyquist rate;oversampling;sampling (signal processing);sensor;snapshot (computer storage);time complexity;time series	Animesh Kumar;Prakash Ishwar;Kannan Ramchandran	2011	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2010.2090194	wireless sensor network;image resolution;telecommunications;image processing;computer science;control theory;mathematics;accuracy and precision;statistics	Visualization	51.0867098695904	16.41023042235386	69513

The electronic apparatus which performs the transformation, or any part of the apparatus, can be described by a linear graph which represents transitions between different memory-states. It will be shown how these graphs can be used to systematically classify codes, combine different blocks of apparatus, examine synchronism of decoding apparatus, etc. Linear graphs have been studied as mathematical systems in connection with topology, Markov chains, and electrical network theory; hence there is already much theory which might be profitably applied to communication problems.

We assume that the measurements follow the standard path loss model and are corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. Under this model, the maximum likelihood solution to the source localization problem involves solving a non-linear least squares optimization problem. We study the convergence property of a normalized incremental gradient method for solving this problem. Remarkably, despite the fact that the problem is non-convex, the normalized incremental gradient method generates a sequence of iterates which are attracted to the global optimum under some mild conditions.	additive white gaussian noise;capability maturity model integration;convex function;global optimization;gradient method;internationalization and localization;linear least squares (mathematics);mathematical optimization;microsoft customer care framework;non-linear least squares;optimization problem;randomized algorithm;sensor;stochastic gradient descent;subderivative;subgradient method;utility functions on indivisible goods	Michael G.

We do not assume any particular correlation structure between these random variables; in particular, X may be a non-Markovian sequence. An adapted embedding of X is a sequence of the form R(X1), R(X1, X2), R(X1, X2, X3), etc where R is a transformation defined over finite length sequences. In this extended abstract we characterize a wide class of adapted embeddings of X that result in a first-order homogeneous Markov chain. We show that any transformation R has a unique coarsest refinement R′ in this class such that R(X1), R (X1, X2), R (X1, X2, X3), etc is Markovian. (By refinement we mean that R′(u) = R′(v) implies R(u) = R(v), and by coarsest refinement we mean that R′ is a deterministic function of any other refinement of R in our class of transformations.) We propose a specific embedding that we denote as R which is particularly amenable for analyzing the occurrence of patterns described by regular expressions in X. A toy example of a non-Markovian sequence of 0’s and 1’s is analyzed thoroughly: discrete asymptotic distributions are established for the number of occurrences of a certain regular pattern in X1, ..., Xn as n→∞ whereas a Gaussian asymptotic distribution is shown to apply for another regular pattern.	first-order predicate;markov chain;refinement (computing);regular expression	Manuel E.

Several algorithms, along with their convergence properties, have been studied in the literature, among which the most popular are the (weighted) average consensus based schemes. One of the most critical aspects of these algorithms is that they suffer from catastrophic noise propagation. We show that the noise affecting the system state variables has a variance that grows linearly with the time index. In addition, we prove that encoding the information on the first forward difference of the state variables rather than on the state itself improves noise resilience, since it guarantees that the asymptotic value of the consensus is affected by noise with bounded variance. The results of our in-depth analysis of the effect of additive noise on consensus algorithms are valid regardless of the noise statistics and for arbitrary network topologies, i.e., arbitrary Laplacian matrices, and contain as special cases previously known results.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;finite difference;network topology;software propagation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Antonio Fasano;Gesualdo Scutari	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518100	distributed algorithm;wireless sensor network;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	Robotics	47.54881456137529	9.463017313688942	70296

Intrinsic to each EM algorithm is a complete-data space (CDS)-a hypothetical set of random variables that is related to the parameters more naturally than the measurements are. The authors describe two generalizations of the EM paradigm: (i) allowing the relationship between the CDS and the measured data to be nondeterministic, and (ii) using a sequence of alternating complete-data spaces. These generalizations are motivated in part by the influence of the CDS on the convergence rate, a relationship that is formalized through a data-processing inequality for Fisher information. These concepts are applied to the problem of estimating superimposed signals in Gaussian noise, and it is shown that the new space alternating generalized EM algorithm converges significantly faster than the ordinary EM algorithm. >	algorithm;dataspaces;spaces	Jeffrey A.

The Cramer–Rao bounds (CRBs), which are lower bounds on variances of estimation errors for any unbiased estimators, are different with signal structures exploited. A general formula for the CRB covariance matrix is presented which allows specific bounds with a known signal structure to be easily obtained. When the incident signals are of amplitude modulation, the CRB with the modulation information is first presented using the formula. The general formula provides easy analysis of the CRB for various signal structures on a unified basis. r 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The processes of this class, which seem to include most point processes of practical interest, are called regular point processes (RPP's). Expressions for the evolution of these processes and especially for their joint occurrence statistics are derived. Compound RPP's, which are RPP's whose intensity functions are themselves stochastic processes, are shown to be RPP's whose intensity functions are given as the causal minimum mean-squared-error (MMSE) estimates of the given intensity functions. The superposition of two independent RPP's is shown to yield an RPP whose intensity is given as a causal least squares estimate of the appropriate combination of the two given intensity functions. A general likelihood-ratio formula for the detection of compound RPP's is obtained. Singular detection cases are characterized. Detection procedures thai use only the total number of counts are discussed. As an example, the optimal detection scheme for signals of the random-telegraph type with unknown transition intensities is derived.		Izhak Rubin	1972	IEEE Trans.

We will refer to this new receiver as the whitened adaptive beamformer orthogonal rejection test (W-ABORT). Through Monte Carlo simulations this new detector was shown to provide better rejection capabilities of mismatched (e.g., sidelobe) signals than existing ones, like ABORT or the adaptive coherence estimator (ACE), but at the price of a certain loss in terms of detection of matched (i.e., mainlobe) signals. The aim of this paper is to provide a theoretical validation of this fact. We consider both the case of distributed targets and point-like targets. We provide a statistical characterization of the W-ABORT test statistic, under the null hypothesis, and for matched and mismatched signals under the alternative hypothesis. For distributed targets, the probability of false alarm and the probability of detection can only be expressed in terms of multi-dimensional integrals, and are thus very complicated to obtain; in contrast, for point-like targets, such probabilities can be easily calculated by numerical integration techniques. The theoretical expressions derived herein corroborate the simulation results obtained previously.	ace;adaptive beamformer;beamforming;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;numerical integration;profiling (computer programming);rejection sampling;simulation	Francesco Bandiera;Olivier Besson;Danilo Orlando;Giuseppe Ricci	2008	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2007.912269	computer simulation;econometrics;speech recognition;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method	HPC	51.858144317516306	10.429718689421065	71782

Levy processes contain a number of very important processes as special cases such as Brownian motion, the Poisson process, stable and self-decomposable processes and subordinators, and so on. But its sample paths are discontinuity, which makes the analysis more difficult. In this paper, we try to get over this difficulty. The contributions of this paper are as follows: (a) we will use Lyapunov functional method to study the pth moment asymptotic stability and almost sure asymptotic stability of neutral stochastic functional differential equations with Levy processes; (b) under the result of (a), we will investigate two types of continuity of the solution: continuous in the pth moment and continuous in probability. Finally, we provide an example to illustrate the usefulness of the obtained results.

Kan and Ross [9] suggested a probabilistic transposition scheme and showed that no advantage was obtained by rendering the scheme probabilistic. Their scheme, however, required that the probability of performing the operation, be time invariant. As opposed to this, we shall define move operations which are essentially probabilistic, but the probabilities associated with the move operations are dynamically varied. Let f(n) be the probability (at time 'n') of any element being moved to the front of the list on being accessed. Observe that this implies that an element, on being accessed, stays where it is with probability (1-f(n)).

This matrix commonly exhibits a particular structure: for instance, this is the case for active systems using a symmetrically spaced linear array with constant pulse repetition interval. We propose using the particular persymmetric structure of the covariance matrix to improve the detection performance. In this context, this work provides two new adaptive detectors for Gaussian additive noise and non-Gaussian additive noise which is modeled by the spherically invariant random vector (SIRV). Their statistical properties are then derived and compared with simulations. The vast improvement in their detection performance is demonstrated by way of simulations or experimental ground clutter data. This allows for the analysis of the proposed detectors on both real Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.	additive white gaussian noise;clutter;radar;sensor;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Guilhem Pailloux;Philippe Forster;Jean Philippe Ovarlez;Frédéric Pascal	2011	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2011.6034639	electronic engineering;pattern recognition;constant false alarm rate;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Vision	51.49417039588316	10.64891953388704	72967

Regular conditional versions of the forward and inverse Bayes formula have variational characterisations involving the minimisation of an apparent information, and the maximisation of a compatible information. These both have natural information theoretic interpretations, according to which Bayes’ formula and its inverse are optimal information processors. The variational characterisation of the forward formula has the same form as that of Gibbs measures in statistical mechanics. The special case in which X and Y are diffusion processes governed by stochastic differential equations is examined in detail. The minimisation of apparent information is shown then to involve a stochastic optimal control problem for the signal process, with cost that is quadratic in both the control and observation fit. This leads to a differential formula for the pathwise nonlinear interpolator. Local versions of the variational characterisations are developed, which quantify information flow in the estimators. In this context, the information conserving property of bayesian estimators coincides with the Davis-Varaiya martingale stochastic dynamic programming principle.	approximation;calculus of variations;central processing unit;dynamic programming;kullback–leibler divergence;nonlinear system;optimal control;stochastic programming;theory;variational principle	Sanjoy K.

We address the cases of unknown (or known with a certain error) intersubarray displacements, imperfect synchronization of subarrays in time, unknown propagation channel mismatches between subarrays, as well as combinations of these effects. A new subspace-based approach to DOA estimation is proposed, which is applicable to this general class of partly calibrated arrays. DOA identifiability issues for such arrays are discussed, and a relevant Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is derived. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the proposed estimators.	direction of arrival;histogram of oriented displacements;numerical method;software propagation	Chong Meng Samson See;Alex B.

Sequentially received samples are IID both before and after a single unknown change time. Unlike previous approaches to change detection that assume a known probability density function (PDF) for the observations at the start, the problem formulated here is to detect a change between two given PDFs in either direction, meaning that at any given time the number of hypotheses to be tracked is always twice the number of samples received. A Bayesian multiple hypothesis approach is proposed and shown to have the following properties: (i) unlike previous tests that operate with a threshold, the minimum-cost hypothesis is tracked through time, including that of no change. (ii) under an exponential delay cost function and suitable parameter choices, the proposed procedure's probability of detecting a change in the incorrect direction asymptotically vanishes with time, (iii) the method is recursive with constant computation per unit time, and (iv) error probabilities may be directly traded off with average delay. Performance results using simulation confirm the derived properties and also reveal that the additional average delay after a transient period corresponding to when the starting state is uncertain, compared to that of the optimal one-sided test, CUSUM, is modest.	computation;hierarchical and recursive queries in sql;loss function;portable document format;recursion;sensor;simulation;time complexity	James Falt;Steven D.

However, the corresponding simple estimation fusion formula is absent in a general distributed multisensor system. In this paper, an efficient iterative algorithm for distributed multisensor estimation fusion without any restrictive assumption on the noise covariance (i.e., the assumption of independent observation noises across sensors and the two-sensor system, and the direct computation of the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of the joint error covariance of local estimates are not necessary) is presented. At each iteration, only the inverse or generalized inverse of a matrix having the same dimension as the error covariance of a single-sensor estimate is required. In fact, the proposed algorithm is a generalization of Bar-Shalom and Campo's fusion formula and reduces the computational complexity significantly since the number of iterative steps is less than the number of sensors.

In this paper, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the sparsity of signals for which our matrices guarantee recovery. These bounds are tight to within a multiplicative factor of at most  $4\sqrt {2}$ . We provide new theoretical results and detailed simulations, which indicate that the construction is competitive with Gaussian random matrices, and that recovery is tolerant to noise. A new recovery algorithm tailored to the construction is also given.	algorithm;coefficient;compressed sensing;hadamard transform;simulation;sparse matrix	Darryn E. Bryant;Charles J.

192b0fb85e905fce29696540f2205fa794cf3faa	uniform recovery from subgaussian multi-sensor measurements		Parallel acquisition systems are employed successfully in a variety of different sensing applications when a single sensor cannot provide enough measurements for a high-quality reconstruction. In this paper, we consider compressed sensing (CS) for parallel acquisition systems when the individual sensors use subgaussian random sampling. Our main results are a series of uniform recovery guarantees which relate the number of measurements required to the basis in which the solution is sparse and certain characteristics of the multi-sensor system, known as sensor profile matrices. In particular, we derive sufficient conditions for optimal recovery, in the sense that the number of measurements required per sensor decreases linearly with the total number of sensors, and demonstrate explicit examples of multi-sensor systems for which this holds. We establish these results by proving the so-called Asymmetric Restricted Isometry Property (ARIP) for the sensing system and use this to derive both nonuniversal and universal recovery guarantees. Compared to existing work, our results not only lead to better stability and robustness estimates but also provide simpler and sharper constants in the measurement conditions. Finally, we show how the problem of CS with block-diagonal sensing matrices can be viewed as a particular case of our multi-sensor framework. Specializing our results to this setting leads to a new recovery guarantee depending only on the incoherence of the sparsity basis. This improves existing results in the literature and confirms the existence of deterministic sparsity bases for which CS with subgaussian block-diagonal matrices has a comparable recovery guarantee to CS with full subgaussian matrices.	compressed sensing;monte carlo method;restricted isometry property;sampling (signal processing);sensor;sparse matrix;transformation matrix	Il Yong Chun;Ben Adcock	2016	CoRR		mathematical optimization;simulation;telecommunications;mathematics;algorithm	ML	47.860494607793115	9.407985848118013	74461

We assume that an ↓ 0, nan ↑ ∞, dn = nan(log n)−1 → ∞ and nan(log n)−7/3 = O(1). In Berthet (1996, 2005) the fourth assumption was shown to be critical with respect to the pointwise rates of convergence in the functional law of Deheuvels and Mason (1992) for Θn because strong approximation methods become ineffective at such a small scale an. We are now able to study directly these small empirical increments and compute the exact rate of clustering of Θn to any Strassen function having Lebesgue derivative of bounded variation by making use of a sharp small deviation estimate for a Poisson process of high intensity due to Shmileva (2003a). It turns out that the best rates are of order dn1/4(log n)−1 and are faster than in the Brownian case whereas the slowest rates are of order dn−1/2 and correspond to the apparently crude ones obtained in Berthet (2005) by means of Gaussian small ball probabilities. These different sharp properties of the empirical and Brownian paths imply an almost sure lower bound in the strong invariance principle and provide a new insight into the famous KMT approximation of αn.

For linear algorithms, occurrence of unconditional (multiple) consensus turns out to be equivalent to (class-)ergodicity of the transition chain (An). For a wide class of chains, chains with so-called balanced asymmetry property, necessary and sufficient conditions for ergodicity and class-ergodicity are derived. The results are employed to analyze the limiting behavior of agents' states in the JLM model, the Krause model, and the Cucker-Smale model. In particular, unconditional single or multiple consensus occurs in all three models. Moreover, a necessary and sufficient condition for unconditional consensus in the JLM model and a sufficient condition for consensus in the Cucker-Smale model are obtained.	algorithm;ergodicity;multi-agent system	Sadegh Bolouki;Roland P.

888033f04ae9c79fcab9ef055762f4bb353648ae	mismatched sparse denoiser requires overestimating the support length		A well-known result [1, Lemma 3.4] states that, without noise, it is better to overestimate the support of a sparse signal, since, if the estimated support includes the true support, the reconstruction is perfect. In this paper, we investigate whether this result holds also in the presence of noise. First, we derive the covariance matrix of the signal estimate when the observation matrix is Gaussian, generalizing existing results. Then, we show that, even in the noisy case, overestimating the support length is the preferred solution, as the error incurred by missing some signal components dominates the overall error variance. Finally, an upper bound of the estimated support length is provided to avoid excessive noise amplification.	sparse matrix	Giulio Coluccia;Aline Roumy;Enrico Magli	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953058	artificial intelligence;mathematical optimization;compressed sensing;statistics;pattern recognition;noise measurement;sparse matrix;covariance matrix;lemma (mathematics);sparse approximation;matrix (mathematics);upper and lower bounds;mathematics	Robotics	48.818587726427424	9.378395530537555	74926

80ab790d078184000abe0ac68f6bf176ec20b313	multilevel monte carlo method for statistical model checking of hybrid systems		We study statistical model checking of continuous-time stochastic hybrid systems. The challenge in applying statistical model checking to these systems is that one cannot simulate such systems exactly. We employ the multilevel Monte Carlo method (MLMC) and work on a sequence of discrete-time stochastic processes whose executions approximate and converge weakly to that of the original continuous-time stochastic hybrid system with respect to satisfaction of the property of interest. With focus on bounded-horizon reachability, we recast the model checking problem as the computation of the distribution of the exit time, which is in turn formulated as the expectation of an indicator function. This latter computation involves estimating discontinuous functionals, which reduces the bound on the convergence rate of the Monte Carlo algorithm. We propose a smoothing step with tunable precision and formally quantify the error of the MLMC approach in the mean-square sense, which is composed of smoothing error, bias, and variance. We formulate a general adaptive algorithm which balances these error terms. Finally, we describe an application of our technique to verify a model of thermostatically controlled loads.	adaptive algorithm;approximation algorithm;computation;converge;hybrid system;model checking;monte carlo algorithm;monte carlo method;rate of convergence;reachability;simulation;smoothing;statistical model;stochastic process	Sadegh Esmaeil Zadeh Soudjani;Rupak Majumdar;Tigran Nagapetyan	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-66335-7_24	mathematics;mathematical optimization;model checking;discrete mathematics;smoothing;monte carlo method;monte carlo method in statistical physics;hybrid system;monte carlo algorithm;hybrid monte carlo;statistical model	Logic	43.638731440433716	5.530575751613661	74997

It is shown that, for m = O(log n), the estimator converges almost surely and its variance is upper-bounded by O(n<sup>-1</sup>) for a large class of stationary ergodic processes with a finite state space. As the order O(n<sup>-1</sup>) of the variance growth on n is the same as that of the optimal Cramer-Rao lower bound, presented is the first near-optimal estimator in the sense of the variance convergence.	entropy rate;ergodicity;state space;stationary ergodic process;stationary process	Alexei Kaltchenko;Nina Timofeeva	2007	2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop	10.3934/amc.2008.2.1	entropy estimation;convergence of random variables;maximum entropy probability distribution;mathematics;statistics	Theory	47.804451854192195	12.159334510748819	75668

In the proposed algorithm, the coherency of incident signals is decorrelated through two equivalent covariance matrices, which are constructed by utilizing cross-correlation information of received data between the two parallel ULAs and the changing reference element. Then, the 2-D DOA estimation can be estimated by using eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of the new constructed matrix. Compared with the previous works, the proposed algorithm can offer remarkably good estimation performance. In addition, the proposed algorithm can achieve automatic parameter pair-matching without additional computation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.	cholesky decomposition;coherence (physics);computation;cross-correlation;direction of arrival;download;estimation of distribution algorithm;simulation	Heping Shi;Zhuo Li;Jihua Cao;Hua Chen	2017	EURASIP J.

Since the Kalman filter is an optimal estimator for object tracking problems under certain conditions and the Wald's sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) requires fewer samples in average than the fixed-sample-size procedure when solving object detection problems, it is beneficial to apply the Kalman filter and the Wald's SPRT to design joint object detection and tracking algorithm. However, the Wald's SPRT cannot be rigorously proved to eventually terminate if the observations are dependent. In this paper, a terminative joint sequential detection and tracking approach is proposed by fusing two test statistics: one is derived in our previous work, and the other is based on independent observations obtained by linearly combining a group of adjacent measurements. The proposed approach takes advantage of both statistics in that it is guaranteed to terminate and it requires on the average a small number of measurements. Numerical results show that the average sample number required by the proposed approach is very small under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions and the actual probabilities of errors are smaller than the nominal probabilities of errors.	algorithm;kalman filter;numerical method;object detection;signal-to-noise ratio;terminate (software);wald's maximin model	Mengqi Ren;Ruixin Niu	2015	2015 18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)		econometrics;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	49.09621052225303	9.608302500117748	76397

The aim is to optimize an objective comprising of false alarm, delay cost and cumulative measurement sampling cost. The paper shows that under reasonable conditions, the optimal strategy has the following intuitive structure: when the Bayesian estimate (posterior distribution) of the Markov chain is away from the target state, look less frequently; while if the posterior is close to the target state, look more frequently. Bounds are derived for the optimal strategy. Also the achievable optimal cost of the sequential detector as a function of transition dynamics and observation distribution is analyzed.	markov chain;sampling (signal processing)	Vikram Krishnamurthy	2012	2012 50th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/Allerton.2012.6483239	econometrics;mathematical optimization;gibbs sampling;partially observable markov decision process;markov chain monte carlo;markov property;slice sampling;mathematics;markov model;hidden markov model;statistics;variable-order markov model	Metrics	46.23374121084062	7.502419924138095	76487

In particular, we use entanglement swapping and purification to partially entangle widely separated nodes. The simplest method consists of performing entanglement swappings along the shortest chain of links connecting the two nodes. However, we show that this method may be improved upon by choosing a protocol with a specific ordering of swappings and purifications. A priori, the design that produces optimal improvement is not clear. However, we parameterize the choices and find that the optimal values depend strongly on the desired measure of improvement. As an initial application, we apply the new improved protocols to the Erdös–Rényi network and obtain results including low density limits and an exact calculation of the average entanglement gained at the critical point.	critical point (network science);mathematical optimization;optimization problem;paging;purification of quantum state;quantum entanglement;quantum teleportation;qubit	G John Lapeyre;S.

466d05df931a993c6796b58eae7f2a80f0d47877	local large deviation: a mcmillian theorem for coloured random graph processes		Abstract. For a finite typed graph on n nodes and with type law μ, we define the socalled spectral potential ρλ( ·, μ), of the graph.From the ρλ( ·, μ) we obtain Kullback action or the deviation function, Hλ(π ‖ ν), with respect to an empirical pair measure, π, as the Legendre dual. For the finite typed random graph conditioned to have an empirical link measure π and empirical type measure μ, we prove a Local large deviation principle (LLDP), with rate function Hλ(π ‖ ν) and speed n. We deduce from this LLDP, a full conditional large deviation principle and a weak variant of the classical McMillian Theorem for the typed random graphs. Given the typical empirical link measure, λμ⊗μ, the number of typed random graphs is approximately equal e (	approximation;bell's theorem;link layer discovery protocol;random graph	Kwabena Doku-Amponsah	2017	CoRR			ML	44.331055455276136	15.130017199290185	76996

In 1996, Talagrand [19] established a lower bound on the correlation in terms of how much the two families depend simultaneously on the same coordinates. Talagrand’s method and results inspired a number of important works in combinatorics and probability theory. In this paper we present stronger correlation lower bounds that hold when the increasing families satisfy natural regularity or symmetry conditions. In addition, we present several new classes of examples for which Talagrand’s bound is tight. A central tool in the paper is a simple lemma asserting that for monotone events noise decreases correlation. This lemma gives also a very simple derivation of the classical FKG inequality for product measures, and leads to a simplification of part of Talagrand’s proof.

A number of source DOAs greater than the number of physical array elements are randomly generated, without restriction on the angular separation. Two augmentation algorithms are considered before application of traditional spatial spectrum estimation algorithms: MVDR and MUSIC. Detection and false alarm statistics are generated from the spatial spectrum. MUSIC requires the knowledge on the number of source, which can be estimated from existing source number estimation algorithms. The effect of source number estimation errors on the detection performance is evaluated. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to validate this detection scheme.	algorithm;angularjs;direction of arrival;monte carlo method;procedural generation;sensor;simulation;sparse matrix;spectral density estimation	Yu Rong;Daniel W.

8773653cbaf080bbb15842a7b8bbf565a240c3de	recognising multidimensional euclidean preferences		Euclidean preferences are a widely studied preference model, in which decision makers and alternatives are embedded in d-dimensional Euclidean space. Decision makers prefer those alternatives closer to them. This model, also known as multidimensional unfolding, has applications in economics, psychometrics, marketing, and many other fields. We study the problem of deciding whether a given preference profile is d-Euclidean. For the one-dimensional case, polynomial-time algorithms are known. We show that, in contrast, for every other fixed dimension d > 1, the recognition problem is equivalent to the existential theory of the reals (ETR), and so in particular NP-hard. We further show that some Euclidean preference profiles require exponentially many bits in order to specify any Euclidean embedding, and prove that the domain of d-Euclidean preferences does not admit a finite forbidden minor characterisation for any d > 1. We also study dichotomous preferences and the behaviour of other metrics, and survey a variety of related work.	algorithm;embedded system;existential theory of the reals;forbidden graph characterization;np-hardness;time complexity;unfolding (dsp implementation)	Dominik Peters	2017			combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;mathematical economics;algorithm	Theory	42.65997908648844	17.603260428738043	77259

In the case of a large number of measurements, an asymptotic efficacy is analytically computed as a general measure of detection performance. The derivative of the efficacy with respect to the noise level is also analytically computed. Positivity of this derivative is the condition for enhancement of the detection performance by increasing the level of noise. The behavior of this derivative is analyzed in various important situations, especially showing when noise-enhanced detection is feasible and when it is not.	dead reckoning;detection theory;limiter;local optimum;noise (electronics);nonlinear system;saturation arithmetic;utility functions on indivisible goods;white noise	Fabing Duan;Fran&#x00E7;ois Chapeau-Blondeau;Derek Abbott	2013	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2013.05.009	gaussian noise;quantum noise;noise;control theory;mathematics;stochastic resonance;detection theory	EDA	50.74082259795735	12.239003635519461	77500

The theory uses a mesoscopic view, i.e. it works with probabilities instead of individual configurations used in micro-simulations. An exact stochastic analysis can be done using the theory of Markov processes. But this analysis is restricted to small problems only. For larger problems we compute the distribution using a factorization into marginals. These marginals are then approximated by the given marginals of low order with iterative proportional fitting using the maximum entropy principle. This method has been developed in probabilistic logic. Our method leads to a set of difference equations which have to be iterated numerically. We use the exact methods as well as our approximations to investigate the popular nonlinear voter model (NLVM). We show that the """"phase transitions"""" regarded in recent papers are artifacts of the mean-field approximation. They do not show up in the real automata. There exist many mathematical peculiarities of the NLVM which raise doubts concerning the suitability of the model. As an alternative we propose the Exponential Voter Model which depends on a single parameter only, the inverse """"temperature"""" β.

This PSD estimation bias effect we call ldquospectral scoopingrdquo is most prominent for narrowband interference (i.e., occupying only a few spectral bins at the desired PSD estimation resolution). Scooping is problematic in radio astronomy where bias in either the weak signal or noise floor spectra can corrupt the observation. The mathematical basis for scooping is derived, and an algorithm to eliminate it is proposed. Both simulated and real data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.	adaptive beamformer;algorithm;beamforming;experiment;interference (communication);noise floor	Brian D.

Given a Z2-action, along with a Z2-entropy dimension, we also consider a finer notion of directional entropy dimension arising from its subactions. The entropy dimension of a Z2-action and the directional entropy dimensions of its subactions satisfy certain inequalities. We present several constructions of strictly ergodic Z2-subshifts of positive entropy dimension with diverse properties of their subgroup actions. In particular, we show that there is a Z2-subshift of full dimension in which every direction has entropy 0.	ergodicity;kolmogorov complexity;minkowski–bouligand dimension;topological entropy	Uijin Jung;Jungseob Lee;Kyewon Koh Park	2017	Entropy	10.3390/e19020046	entropy power inequality;joint entropy;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;conditional quantum entropy;quantum relative entropy;topology;generalized relative entropy;binary entropy function;rényi entropy;transfer entropy;maximum entropy probability distribution;principle of maximum entropy;mathematics;maximum entropy thermodynamics;joint quantum entropy;configuration entropy;minkowski–bouligand dimension;entropy rate;conditional entropy;topological entropy in physics;min entropy	Theory	44.682650245336454	16.03282720313891	79086

On the assumption of the availability of a set of independent samples from Class A envelope distribution, the asymptotic performances of several estimation procedures are explored. From this analysis, estimates based on the method of moments are seen to be consistent and computationally desirable but highly inefficient, whereas more efficient likelihood-based estimators are seen to be computationally unwieldy. However, an estimator that initiates likelihood iteration with the method-of-moments estimates is seen to overcome these difficulties in its asymptotic performance. Unfortunately, simulation of this third estimator for practical sample sizes reveals poor performance under these conditions. To overcome this lack of small-sample efficiency, a similar estimator that initiates likelihood iteration with physically motivated (but nonoptimal) estimates is also proposed. Simulation of this latter estimator for practical sample sizes indicates that near-optimal performance is attained by this technique. >	estimation theory;interference (communication)	Serena M.

For each time, we just estimate the DOAs of one group which has the minimum coherent signals based on forward spatial smoothing (FSS), and the information of this group is eliminated from the array covariance matrix with oblique projection technique. Then we estimate the next group similarly until all groups are estimated. Afterwards, we use the forward/backward spatial smoothing (FBSS) to further improve the estimation accuracy of the DOAs in each group separately. The new method not only utilizes less array sensors to resolve multi-group coherent signals, but also estimates the same DOAs from different groups. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and small number of snapshots. The proposed method estimates the DOAs of each group sequentially for multi-group coherent signals.Forward spatial smoothing is used to decorrelate coherent signals group by group.Less array sensors are used to resolve multi-group coherent signals for the proposed method.This new method can estimate the same DOA as long as they are from different groups.	coherence (physics);direction of arrival	Jinqiang Wei;Xu Xu;Dawei Luo;Zhongfu Ye	2017	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2016.06.032	multipath propagation;electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics;statistics	ML	52.28857223700723	7.285396895200673	79397

We make use of the framework termed QBDs with marked time epochs that transforms the transient problem into a stationary one by applying a discrete Erlangization and constructing a reset Markov chain. To avoid the need to repeat ail computations for each initial configuration, we propose a level based recursive algorithm that uses intermediate results obtained for initial states belonging to levels 0,hellip, tau - 1 to compute the transient measure when the initial state is part of level tau. Also, the computations for all states belonging to level tau are performed simultaneously. A key property of our approach lies in the exploitation of the internal structure of the block matrices involved, avoiding any need to store large matrices. A flexible Matlab implementation of the proposed algorithm is available online.	algorithm;computation;matlab;markov chain;recursion (computer science);stationary process	Jeroen Van Velthoven;Benny Van Houdt;Chris Blondia	2007	Fourth International Conference on the Quantitative Evaluation of Systems (QEST 2007)	10.1109/QEST.2007.21	markov chain;mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;markov process;statistics;recursion	Embedded	45.38084099282313	9.985615911830148	80436
49cc502224420ee9d83c4ff205812a781b3a5852	inference under information constraints i: lower bounds from chi-square contraction		We consider a distributed inference problem where only limited information is allowed from each sample. We present a general framework where multiple players are given one independent sample each about which they can only provide limited information to a central referee. Motivated by important instances of communication and privacy constraints, in our abstraction we allow each player to describe its observed sample to the referee using a channel from a prespecified family of channels $\cal W$. This family $\cal W$ can be instantiated to capture both the communication- and privacy-constrained settings and beyond. The central referee uses the messages from players to solve an inference problem for the unknown underlying distribution that generated samples of the players. We derive lower bounds for sample complexity of learning and testing discrete distributions in this information-constrained setting. Underlying our lower bounds is a quantitative characterization of the contraction in chi-square distances between the observed distributions of the samples when an information constraint is placed. This contraction is captured in a local neighborhood in terms of chi-square and decoupled chi-square fluctuations of a given channel, two quantities we introduce in this work. The former captures the average distance between two product distributions and the latter the distance of a product distribution to a mixture of product distributions. These quantities may be of independent interest. As a corollary, we quantify the sample complexity blow-up in the learning and testing settings when enforcing the corresponding local information constraints. In addition, we systematically study the role of randomness and consider both private- and public-coin protocols.		Jayadev Acharya;Clément L.

We present an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for recovering the signal in the random dense setting where each observed histogram involves a random subset of size proportional to n of entries. We characterize the performance of the algorithm in the asymptotic regime where the number of observations m tends to infinity proportionally to n, by deriving the corresponding State Evolution (SE) equations and studying their dynamics. We initiate the analysis of the multi-dimensional SE dynamics by proving their convergence to a fixed point, along with some further properties of the iterates. The analysis reveals sharp phase transition phenomena where the behavior of AMP changes from exact recovery to weak correlation with the signal as m/n crosses a threshold. We derive formulae for the threshold in some special cases and show that they accurately match experimental behavior.	algorithm;discrete-time signal;fixed point (mathematics);message passing	Ahmed El Alaoui;Aaditya Ramdas;Florent Krzakala;Lenka Zdeborová;Michael I.

Denote by $G_T(Theta )$ the space of all random variables $(theta cdot X)_T$, where $theta $ is a predictable $X$-integrable process such that the stochastic integral $theta cdot X$ is in the space ${cal S} ^2$ of semimartingales. We investigate under which conditions on the semimartingale $X$ the space $G_T(Theta )$ is closed in ${cal L} ^2(Omega , {cal F} ,P)$, a question which arises naturally in the applications to financial mathematics. Our main results give necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the closedness of $G_T(Theta )$ in ${cal L} ^2(P)$. Most of these conditions deal with BMO-martingales and reverse Holder inequalities which are equivalent to weighted norm inequalities. By means of these last inequalities, we also extend previous results on the Follmer-Schweizer decomposition.	contingency (philosophy);printing;risk-neutral measure;scott continuity;social inequality	Freddy Delbaen;Pascale Monat;Walter Schachermayer;Martin Schweizer;Christophe Stricker	1997	Finance and Stochastics	10.1007/s007800050021	random variable;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;economics;calculus;mathematics;incomplete markets;statistics	Robotics	43.16161517803751	16.223789482159596	81040

We consider the receive antenna array to be configured with multiple vector sensors, each of which consists of a pair of orthogonal velocity sensors. A quadrilinear model for the channel is formulated, and a quadrilinear decomposition method developed for joint angle and delay estimation (JADE). In addition, a computationally simple subspace-based algorithm is proposed for the problem under consideration. The basic idea behind this algorithm is to use the angle information embedded in the velocity vector sensors to start two polynomial rooting procedures for the angle and delay in succession. Simulation results are finally presented to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.	algorithm;channel (communications);embedded system;estimation theory;jade;multipath propagation;polynomial;sensor;simulation;succession;velocity (software development)	Jin He;M.

100d4058db735c0ce23d3c07c28c85720bca77b2	complexity of inferring local transition functions of discrete dynamical systems		We consider the problem of inferring the local transition functions of discrete dynamical systems from observed behavior. Our focus is on synchronous systems whose local transition functions are threshold functions. We assume that the topology of the system is known and that the goal is to infer a threshold value for each node so that the system produces the observed behavior. We show that some of these inference problems are efficiently solvable while others are NP-complete, even when the underlying graph of the dynamical system is a simple path. We also identify a fixed parameter tractable problem in this context.	cobham's thesis;decision problem;directed graph;dynamical system;np-completeness;path (graph theory)	Abhijin Adiga;Chris J.

These parameters are chosen as \theta_{1} = R(0), \theta_{2} = |R( \tau )| /R(0), \theta_{3} = phase of R( \tau) , and they are simply related to the parameters of the spectral density of \cal y . This paper is concerned with the determination of most powerful (MP) tests that distinguish between random signals having different covariance functions. The tests are based upon N correlated pairs of independent observations on \cal y . Although the MP test that distinguishes between \theta = \theta_{o} and the alternative hypothesis \theta = \theta_{1} has been solved previously [11], the problem of identifying the random signals is often complicated by the fact that the signal power \theta_{1} = R(0) is not a distinguishing feature of either hypothesis. This paper determines the MP invariant test that delineates between the composite hypothesis \lambda \equiv R( \tau)/R(0) = \lambda_{0} and the composite alternative \lambda = \lambda_{1} . In addition, the uniformly MP invariant test that distinguishes between the composite hypotheses \theta_{2}  and \theta_{2} > | \lambda_{0} | has also been found. In all cases, exact probability distributions have been obtained.		Kenneth S. Miller;Marvin M. Rochwarger	1976	IEEE Trans.

The elevation estimation in high precision is achieved based on the information of azimuth estimation in low precision and the azimuth estimation in high precision is achieved based on the information of elevation estimation in low precision. Therefore, the algorithm is named interlaced double-precision (IDP) 2-D angle estimation algorithm. The proposed algorithm can achieve 2-D angle estimation with unknown source number and without pair matching based on the minimum-norm (MN) technique and the least-square (LS) technique. The maximal estimable source number is (M2/4 + M/2-1) by the proposed algorithm using L-shaped NAs with M physical sensors in each axis.	algorithm;apache axis;brewster's angle;double-precision floating-point format;interlaced video;maximal set;performance;pseudorandom number generator;sensor;simulation;tiling array	Chao Niu;Yongshun Zhang;Jianrong Guo	2016	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2016.2537826	mathematical optimization;estimation;sensor;mathematics;azimuth;matrix decomposition;correlation;statistics	EDA	52.76876016744791	7.068695804633506	82105

The problem considered in this paper is to estimate the first time τ the random walk reaches a given level. Specifically, the average -moment (p ≥ 1 ) optimization problem infη E|η - τ|p is investigated where the infimum is taken over the set of stopping times that are defined on the observation process. When there is no drift, optimal stopping rules are characterized for both types of observations. When there is a drift, upper and lower bounds on infη E|η - τ|p are established for both types of observations. The bounds are tight in the large-level regime for noisy observations and in the large-level-large-delay regime for delayed observations. Noteworthy, for noisy observations there exists an asymptotically optimal stopping rule that is a function of a single observation. Simulation results are provided that corroborate the validity of the results for non-asymptotic settings.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;first-hitting-time model;mathematical optimization;optimal stopping;optimization problem;simulation;wiener filter	Marat V.

We construct a stochastic differential equation to describe the temperature evolution in a line subject to randomness of the ambient temperature. When the distribution of the ambient temperature changes, so does the dependence of the tripping probability as a function of line current. The theory of extremes of Gaussian random fields is used to guide the size of the underlying frequency inspection so as to insure that current is effective for controlling the risk of overheating. In particular, we show that only when the change of temperature is suitably light-tailed (according to a precise definition discussed in the paper), the current provides a powerful enough mechanism to control tripping probabilities due to overheating. We then provide bounds that can be used to control the tripping probability in our stochastic model.	emoticon;long tail;mathematical optimization;norm (social);randomness;stochastic process;tails;time complexity	Jose H.

However, when it recently became apparent that only stochastic effects can explain certain phenomenons, Markov chains again turned out to be a suitable modeling formalism in the form of Markov population models. Those Markov chains possess a structured but potentially infinite state space where each state encodes the current counts of a fixed number of population types. Due to the infinite state space, classical steady state analysis methods can not be used directly. Hence, this doctoral thesis presents a highly efficient method to compute a finite state space truncation entailing most of the steady state probability mass. Further, stochastic complementation is lifted to the infinite state space setting and is combined with truncation based reachability analysis and aggregation to derive state wise steady state bounds. This method achieves high performance even for stiff systems. Particular attention is paid on a system’s ability to maintain stable oscillations and thus optimized analysis methods are developed alongside. In order to prove their applicability, all techniques are evaluated on a large variety of biological models.	markov chain;mathematical model;numerical analysis	David Spieler	2014			chemistry;calculus;performance art;mechanical engineering	Logic	41.74214940028369	5.144660867879722	82516

Each of those sensors, which individually are incapable of monitoring the target object’s shape and size, sends only binary data describing whether or not it detects at every moment the target object. By using these data and the explicit formulas derived in this paper, we can estimate the size and the perimeter length of the target object even without sensor location information. An additional parameter, which is a function of the shape of the target object, can also be estimated when the target object is non-convex.	binary data;characteristic function (convex analysis);connected component (graph theory);convex function;newton's method;numerical method;perimeter;sensor;tag (game)	Hiroshi Saito;Shinsuke Shimogawa;Shigeo Shioda;Junko Harada	2009	IEEE INFOCOM 2009	10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062255	computer vision;wireless sensor network;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;estimation theory;statistics	Robotics	49.2225740633461	5.589354892221887	82604

These distributions have the same parameter space for every q, and in the q = 1 case these are the normal distributions. Some methods to endow this parameter space with Riemannian metric is presented: the second derivative of the q-Rényi entropy, Tsallis-entropy and the relative entropy give rise to a Riemannian metric, the Fisher-information matrix is a natural Riemannian metric, and there are some geometrically motivated metrics which were studied by Siegel, Calvo and Oller, Lovri´c, Min-Oo and Ruh. These metrics are different therefore our differential geometrical calculations based on a unified metric, which covers all the above mentioned metrics among others. We also compute the geometrical properties of this metric, the equation of the geodesic line with some special solutions, the Riemann and Ricci curvature tensors and scalar curvature. Using the correspondence between the volume of the geodesic ball and the scalar curvature we show how the parameter q modulates the statistical distinguishability of close points. We show that some frequently used metric in quantum information geometry can be easily recovered from classical metrics.	fisher information;formation matrix;information geometry;information theory;kubo formula;kullback–leibler divergence;linear algebra;modulation;nx bit;petz;quantum information;relevance;rényi entropy;surround sound;tsallis entropy	Attila Andai	2009	J.

In this paper we generalize the results of [11] to a wider class of distributions of the individual preferences, and obtain new lower and upper bounds for the probability of a rational outcome in several classes of GSWFs. In particular, we show that if the GSWF is monotone and balanced and the distribution of the preferences is uniform, then the probability of a rational outcome is at least 3/4, proving a conjecture raised in [11]. The tools used in the paper are analytic: the Fourier-Walsh expansion of Boolean functions on the discrete cube, properties of Beckner’s noise operator, and the FKG inequality.	2.5d;hadamard transform;leggett–garg inequality;social inequality;monotone	Nathan Keller	2010	J.

A new method for robust beamforming is proposed by minimizing the array output power while controlling the array mainlobe response. Due to the presence of the non-convex response constraints, a new approach based on iteratively linearizing the non-convex constraints is proposed to reformulate the non-convex problem to a series of second-order cone programming (SOCP) subproblems, each of which can be optimally solved by well-established convex optimization techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed method offers better performance than conventional methods tested.

It is similar to the Gaussian mixture model in which the actual marginal distribution is used in place of a Gaussian distribution. This structure leads to simple learning algorithms to find an optimal model. (ii) The OFP model provides a unification of other modeling approaches including the projective methods of Shannon, Mori and Zwanzig, and Chorin, as well as a version of the binning technique for Markov model reduction. (iii) Several general applications are surveyed, including inference and optimal control. Computation of the spectrum, or solutions to dynamic programming equations are possible through a finite dimensional matrix calculation without knowledge of the underlying marginal distribution on which the model is based.	algorithm;complex systems;computation;dynamic programming;hidden markov model;machine learning;marginal model;markov chain;mathematical optimization;mixture model;optimal control;product binning;shannon (unit);unification (computer science)	Sean P.

This paper focuses on a special class of PFSA, which captures finite history of the symbol strings; these PFSA, called D-Markov machines, have a simple algebraic structure and are computationally efficient to construct and implement. The procedure of PFSA construction is based on (i) state splitting that generates symbol blocks of different lengths based on their information contents; and (ii) state merging that assimilates histories by combining two or more symbol blocks without any significant loss of the embedded information. A metric on the probability distribution of symbol blocks is introduced for trade-off between loss of information (e.g., entropy rate) and the number of PFSA states. The underlying algorithms have been validated with three test examples. While the first and second examples elucidate the key concepts and the pertinent numerical steps, the third example presents the results of analysis of time series data, generated from laboratory experimentation, for detection of fatigue crack damage in a polycrystalline alloy. & 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we study the interplay between topology and dynamics of excitable nodes on random networks. The nodal dynamics are discrete, each node being in three possible states: active, refractory, or silent. Loading rules are defined whereby a subset of active nodes may be able to convert a silent node into an active one at the next time step. In the case of simple loading (SL) a silent node becomes active if it receives input from any neighbor. In the majority rules (MR) loading, a silent node fires when the majority of its neighbors are active. We address the question of whether a particular network design pattern confers dynamical advantage for the generation and sustainment of rhythmic activity. We find that the intrinsic properties of a node and the rules for interaction between them determine which structural features of the graph permit sustained activity. With SL the level of activity in the graph increases monotonically with the probability of connections between nodes, while for MR, the level of activity may be either monotonic or nonmonotonic, depending on parameters.	complex systems;design pattern;dynamical system;excitable medium;flow network;interaction;network planning and design;random graph;sl (complexity)	Thounaojam Umeshkanta Singh;Kaustubh Manchanda;Ramakrishna Ramaswamy;Amitabha Bose	2011	SIAM J.

The algorithm combines sequential importance sampling (SIS) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to achieve computational efficiency and stability. In its most general form, the algorithm has three components: i) SIS; ii) a rejuvenation test; and iii) MCMC. Measurements are processed sequentially (with an artificial “time-line” if there is no natural one associated with the measurements) by SIS, which is computationally inexpensive. After each measurement is processed, the rejuvenation test checks whether the resulting SIS particles have to be rejuvenated. When indicated by the test, the particles are completely rejuvenated by MCMC, which removes errors that accumulate from SIS due to the finite number of particles, thus ensuring stability. Whenever possible, the SIS particles can be used to advantage in the MCMC. There is flexibility in the choice of the rejuvenation test as well as the MCMC method, with potential to increase the usefulness of the algorithm. In particular, by using reversible-jump MCMC with multiple models, the algorithm can perform simultaneous model selection and parameter estimation. In this paper, we use a rejuvenation test based on a Kullback–Leibler distance that is easy to compute, and our choice of MCMC is independent Metropolis–Hastings with a Gaussian proposal density. With these choices, we illustrate the use of the algorithm in two signal processing applications (passive source localization with angle-of-arrival and simultaneous weak signal detection and parameter estimation) involving both simulated and real data. The results demonstrate the algorithm’s stability, its built-in protection against model overfitting, and tolerance to model mismatch.	angle of arrival;built-in self-test;detection theory;estimation theory;importance sampling;kullback–leibler divergence;metropolis;metropolis–hastings algorithm;model selection;monte carlo method;overfitting;particle filter;reversible-jump markov chain monte carlo;sampling (signal processing);signal processing	Dominic S.

This new model, termed a stationary Markov model, exhibits a more complicated memory structure in the controlled observations than the existing stationary memoryless model. In the sequential setting, an asymptotically optimal sequential test using a stationary causal Markov control policy enjoying a strong asymptotic optimality condition is proposed for this new model, and its asymptotic performance is characterized. In the fixed sample size setting, bounds for the optimal error exponent for binary hypothesis testing are derived; it is conjectured that the structure of the asymptotically optimal control for the stationary Markov model will be much more complicated than that for the stationary memoryless model.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;causal filter;error exponent;markov chain;markov model;optimal control;stationary process	Sirin Nitinawarat;Venugopal V.

Under the model that all permutations of the numbers 1, . . . , n are equally likely to construct a priority tree of size n we give a detailed averagecase analysis of insertion cost measures: we study the recursion depth and the number of key comparisons when inserting an element into a random size-n priority tree. For inserting a random element we obtain exact and asymptotic results for the expectation and the variance and can further show a central limit law of the parameters studied and for inserting an element with specified priority we can show exact and asymptotic results for the expectation of these quantities.	data structure;fitts's law;insertion sort;priority queue;recursion	Markus Kuba;Alois Panholzer	2007		10.1137/1.9781611972979.2	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;double-ended priority queue;mathematics;priority queue	Theory	39.33678169112509	16.498622404152893	88139

It addresses the problem of n signals closely spaced in (temporal or spatial) frequency. The main result is that for this regime, the CR bound decomposes into a product of simple scalar factors that individually reflect frequency separation, signal powers and covariances, data sampling grid, and sample size. The factored expression provides useful insight into the behavior of the bound for closely spaced frequencies. The result also leads to a new formula for the signal-to-noise (SNR) threshold at which an unbiased frequency estimator can resolve signals closely spaced in frequency. Interestingly, with a simple modification, the formulae are identical to those recently obtained for the conditional (or deterministic) signal model. >		H. B. Lee	1994	IEEE Trans.

6ee2924da7d7beaf83ded11398ab6c945d9fc5c7	a phase transition for the distribution of matching blocks	phase transition	We show distributional results for the length of the longest matching consecutive subsequence between two independent sequences^,, A2,...,Am and B1,B2,...,Bn whose letters are taken from a finite alphabet. We assume that AltA2,... ate i.i.d. with distribution /t and Bi,Bi,... are i.i.d. with distribution v. It is known that if ft and v are not too different, the Chen-Stein method for Poisson approximation can be used to establish distributional results. We extend these results beyond the region where the Chen-Stein method was previously successful. We use a combination of 'matching by patterns' results obtained by Arratia and Waterman [1], and the Chen-Stein method to show that the Poisson approximation can be extended. Our method explains how the matching is achieved. This provides an explanation for the formulas in Arratia and Waterman [1] and thus answers one of the questions posed in comment F19 in Aldous [2]. Furthermore, in the case where the alphabet consists of only two letters, the phase transition observed by Arratia and Waterman [1] for the strong law of large numbers extends to the distributional result. We conjecture that this phase transition on the distributional level holds for any finite alphabet.	approximation;entity–relationship model;smith–waterman algorithm	Claudia Neuhauser	1996	Combinatorics, Probability & Computing	10.1017/S0963548300001930	phase transition;mathematics	Theory	41.47624920406041	14.750554710196734	88505

Such would be the case for the detection of a maneuvering target by a passive sonar system. Based upon autoregressive spectral analysis a detector is presented which is nearly invariant to frequency modulation. In fact, for a large enough frequency modulation the autoregressive detector yields about a 4 dB improvement in detection performance over the conventional narrow— band detector. Furthermore, the autoregressive detector is a CFAR receiver and requires less computation and storage than a conventional narrow— band detector. Thus, the autoregressive detector should be an attractive complement to a conventional narrowband detector.	autoregressive model;computation;constant false alarm rate;fm broadcasting;modulation;sonar (symantec);sensor;spectral density estimation	Steven Kay	1981		10.1109/ICASSP.1981.1171280	phase detector;frequency modulation;gaussian noise;detector;speech recognition;doppler effect;telecommunications;computer science;matched filter;sonar	Arch	51.74335398161446	11.584102484978041	88841

Two motivating examples are studied: 1) the detection of a static object within a given area and 2) the detection of a faulty tank in a three-tank system. From a very general perspective, both of these problems can be thought of as search problems; the goal in both cases is to determine the presence (or absence) of an “object” within a given area of interest (AOI). It is assumed that there are two classes of sensors: a large sensor capable of searching the entire AOI and a set of small sensors which (collectively) search only a subset of the AOI. Measurements from the small sensors are assumed to follow a Bernoulli distribution (depending on whether they detect the object or not). Measurements collected from the large sensor are allowed to follow any exponential family distribution. In order to combine information we propose a system identification framework based on maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation. This requires collecting several measurements (samples) from each sensor. The ML approach allow us to borrow existing convergence and asymptotic normality results from the literature.	euler–bernoulli beam theory;search problem;sensor;system identification;time complexity	Karla E.

These properties mean that the proposed structure can perform coherent signal subspace processing for nearfield wideband sources, making it ideal for wideband range and bearing estimation.

Although the celebrated two-step weighted least squares (2WLS) method is quite successful, its drawback lies in an ill-conditioning problem when the sensor array is quasi-linear. This work presents a multidimensional scaling (MDS)-based localization scheme. Based on the subspace analysis of the scalar product matrix, an auxiliary line is defined in the plane, close to the global minimizer of the cost function. Then, the minimizer on the auxiliary line is found as the estimation of the source position. Simulations show that the proposed scheme achieves high localization accuracy for all kinds of sensor arrays including quasi-linear arrays.	computer simulation;condition number;least squares;loss function;multidimensional scaling;multilateration;unified model	Wuyang Jiang;Changqing Xu;Ling Pei;Wenxian Yu	2016	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2016.2537371	mathematical optimization;estimation;noise measurement;multilateration;mathematics;statistics	Vision	52.22595832371625	5.753343497215598	89689

This estimate stems from the proof of a stronger result: using some estimates for the probability that an Ito process remains in a tube around a deterministic curve, we lower bound the probability that the couple (X,V) remains around a two-dimensional curve up to a given maturity, X being the log-return process and V its instantaneous variance. Then we set an optimization procedure on the set of admissible curves, leading to the desired lower bound on the terminal c.d.f.. Even though the involved constants are less sharp than the ones derived for stochastic volatility models with a particular structure such as Heston [1,6,12], these lower bounds entail moment explosion.	volatility	Vlad Bally;Stefano De Marco	2011	Risk and Decision Analysis	10.3233/RDA-2011-0046	financial economics;econometrics;implied volatility;volatility;mathematics;heston model;mathematical economics;stochastic volatility;sabr volatility model	Logic	43.29392600739727	11.7592300886718	90112

We show that it outperforms the approach with the linear constraint [6] used in the narrowband beamformer, in terms of flat nulls, output SMR and nulling capability for wideband and coherent jammers suppression.	algorithm;beamforming;coherence (physics);radio jamming;shingled magnetic recording;zero suppression	Chung-Yao Chang;Shiunn-Jang Chern	2002		10.1109/ISCAS.2002.1010502	electronic engineering;telecommunications;finite impulse response;control theory;mathematics;maximum likelihood;consistent estimator;statistics;robustness	Robotics	51.321687154305955	8.73900155845583	90207

We consider the case where no accurate nor tractable model can be found, using a model-free approach, called Kernel change detection (KCD). KCD compares two sets of descriptors extracted online from the signal at each time instant: The immediate past set and the immediate future set. Based on the soft margin single-class Support Vector Machine (SVM), we build a dissimilarity measure in feature space between those sets, without estimating densities as an intermediary step. This dissimilarity measure is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the Fisher ratio in the Gaussian case. Implementation issues are addressed; in particular, the dissimilarity measure can be computed online in input space. Simulation results on both synthetic signals and real music signals show the efficiency of KCD.	algorithm;cobham's thesis;feature vector;glr parser;kernel (operating system);simulation;support vector machine;synthetic intelligence;waist–hip ratio	Frédéric Desobry;Manuel Davy;Christian Doncarli	2005	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2005.851098	support vector machine;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	ML	51.96656897477937	11.817710843174893	90739

The identification of the inner state of the system must be made based on observations of counters which entail only information on the total sum of some events from a dual process which has made a transition from an intact to a broken state at some unknown time. Here we demonstrate the general identifiability of this problem in presence of multiple counters.	reversible-jump markov chain monte carlo;turing jump	Jani Lahtinen;Jouko Lampinen	2003	Kybernetika		econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics	AI	44.86812485411548	11.127575561415883	91332
67dc1ad3f5a38727c7083e953594377753b698f5	american options with discontinuous two-level caps		This paper examines the valuation of American capped call options with two-level caps. The structure of the immediate exercise region is significantly more complex than in the classical case with constant cap. When the cap grows over time, making extensive use of probabilistic arguments and local time, we show that the exercise region can be the union of two disconnected sets. Alternatively, it can consist of two sets connected by a line. The problem then reduces to the characterization of the upper boundary of the first set, which is shown to satisfy a recursive integral equation. When the cap decreases over time, the boundary of the exercise region has piecewise constant segments alternating with nonincreasing segments. General representation formulas for the option price, involving the exercise boundaries and the local time of the underlying price process, are derived. An efficient algorithm is developed, and numerical results are provided.	java caps	Jérôme Detemple;Yerkin Kitapbayev	2018	SIAM J.

6d3fe0dc23522e36ab1ea1e459953db2de18b96a	robust capon beamforming against large doa mismatch	doa mismatch;robust adaptive beamformer;capon beamformer;robustness	In the presence of significant direction-of-arrival (DOA) mismatch, existing robust Capon beamformers based on the uncertainty set of the steering vector require a large size of uncertainty set for providing sufficient robustness against the increased mismatch. Under such circumstance, however, their output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) degrade. In this paper, a new robust Capon beamformer is proposed to achieve robustness against large DOA mismatch. The basic idea of the proposed method is to express the estimate of the desired steering vector corresponding to the signal of interest (SOI) as a linear combination of the basis vectors of an orthogonal subspace, then we can easily obtain the estimate of the desired steering vector by rotating this subspace. Different from the uncertainty set based methods, the proposed method does not make any assumptions on the size of the uncertainty set. Thus, compared to the uncertainty set based robust beamformers, the proposed method achieves a higher output SINR performance by preserving its interference-plus-noise suppression abilities in the presence of large DOA mismatch. In addition, computationally efficient online implementation of the proposed method has also been developed. Computer simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of the proposed method. & 2012 Elsevier B.V.

cf98d9cd46054ccbe534bf1aaa34c5a5c29e6097	non-coherent direction of arrival estimation via frequency estimation		This letter investigates the non-coherent Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation problem dealing with the DOA estimation from magnitude only measurements of the array output. The magnitude squared of the array output is expanded as a superposition of some harmonics. Hence, a frequency estimation approach is used to find some nonlinear relations between DOAs, which results in inherent ambiguities. To sol ve the nonlinear equations and resolve the ambiguities, we ass ume a high amplitude reference target at low angles to estimate t he true DOA’s with no ambiguities. However, the proposed algor ithm requires a large number of antenna array elements to accurat ely estimate the DOA’s. To overcome this drawback, and to enhanc e the estimation accuracy, we suggest two variants of the algo rithm. One is to add virtual elements in the array and the second is to integrate multiple snapshots. Simulation results show t hat the proposed frequency estimation-based algorithm outperfor ms the non-coherent GESPAR algorithm in the low signal to noise rat io (SNR) regime and it is two orders of magnitude faster than the non-coherent GESPAR algorithm.	algorithm;coherent;direction of arrival;estimation theory;kernel density estimation;nonlinear system;quantum superposition;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral density estimation	Hadi Zayyani;Mehdi Korki	2016	CoRR		mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics	EDA	52.502034914567226	7.6505938266018045	91642

However, modified-CS depends heavily on the reliability of the known support. An important problem, which must be studied further, is the recoverability of modified-CS when the known support contains a number of errors. In this letter, we analyze the recoverability of modified-CS in a stochastic framework. A sufficient and necessary condition is established for exact recovery of a sparse signal. Utilizing this condition, the recovery probability that reflects the recoverability of modified-CS can be computed explicitly for a sparse signal with [Formula: see text] nonzero entries. Simulation experiments have been carried out to validate our theoretical results.	appendix;compressed sensing;experiment;largest;numerical analysis;portable document format;serializability;simulation;sparse matrix;weight	Jun Zhang;Yuanqing Li;Zhu Liang Yu;Zhenghui Gu	2014		10.1371/journal.pone.0087985	data compression;computer simulation;probability	ML	48.199352353178085	8.9677465836928	91683

We redevelop the theory of labelled Markov processes from this view point, in particular we explore approximation theory. We obtain three main results: (i) It is possible to define bisimulation on general measure spaces and show that it is an equivalence relation. The logical characterization of bisimulation can be done straightforwardly and generally. (ii) A new and flexible approach to approximation based on averaging can be given. This vastly generalizes and streamlines the idea of using conditional expectations to compute approximation. (iii) It is possible to show that there is a minimal bisimulation equivalent to a process obtained as the limit of the finite approximants.	approximation theory;bisimulation;dexter kozen;markov property;transformers;turing completeness	Philippe Chaput;Vincent Danos;Prakash Panangaden;Gordon D.

The first of these is a percolation transition, in which the network develops a macroscopic connected component as edges are added to it. Recent work has shown that if edges are added “competitively” to an undirected network, the onset of percolation is abrupt or “explosive.” A new variant of explosive percolation is introduced here for directed networks, whose critical behavior is explored using numerical simulations and finitesize scaling theory. This process is also characterized by a very rapid percolation transition, but it is not as sudden as in undirected networks. The second phase transition considered here is the emergence of instability in Boolean networks, a class of dynamical systems that are widely used to model gene regulation. The dynamics, which are determined by the network topology and a set of update rules, may be either stable or unstable, meaning that small perturbations to the state of the network either die out or grow to become macroscopic. Here, this transition is analytically mapped onto a well-studied percolation problem, which can be used to predict the average steady-state distance between perturbed and unperturbed trajectories. This map applies to specific Boolean networks with few restrictions on network topology, but can only be applied to two commonly used types of update rules. Finally, a method is introduced for predicting the stability of Boolean networks with a much broader range of update rules. The network is assumed to have a given complex topology, subject only to a locally tree-like condition, and the update rules may be correlated with topological features of the network. While past work has addressed the separate effects of topology and update rules on stability, the present results are the first widely applicable approach to studying how these effects interact. Numerical simulations agree with the theory and show that such correlations between topology and update rules can have profound effects on the qualitative behavior of these systems.

3226fc312a1e6df4f95d28d3a633d6afa816a28f	information distance	algorithm	While Kolmogorov complexity is the accepted absolute measure of information content in an individual finite object, a similarly absolute notion is needed for the information distance between two individual objects, for example, two pictures. We give several natural definitions of a universal information metric, based on length of shortest programs for either ordinary computations or reversible (dissipationless) computations. It turns out that these definitions are equivalent up to an additive logarithmic term. We show that the information distance is a universal cognitive similarity distance. We investigate the maximal correlation of the shortest programs involved, the maximal uncorrelation of programs (a generalization of the Slepian–Wolf theorem of classical information theory), and the density properties of the discrete metric spaces induced by the information distances. A related distance measures the amount of nonreversibility of a computation. Using the physical theory of reversible computation, we give an appropriate (universal, antisymmetric, and transitive) measure of the thermodynamic work required to transform one object in another object by the most efficient process. Information distance between individual objects is needed in pattern recognition where one wants to express effective notions of “pattern similarity” or “cognitive similarity” between individual objects and in thermodynamics of computation where one wants to analyze the energy dissipation of a computation from a particular input to a particular output.	computation;image;information theory;kolmogorov complexity;maximal set;pattern recognition;physical information;reversible computing;self-information;self-similarity;utility functions on indivisible goods	Charles H.

The signal model of monostatic array radar with circular array configuration and UWB stochastic signals is established, while the resolution of two closely spaced targets is modelled as a binary hypothesis test. The statistical angular resolution limit (SARL) for array radar with UWB stochastic signals is derived based on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) with given probabilities of false alarm and detection. The effects of detection parameters, transmit waveforms, array geometry, signal-to-noise ratio and parameters of target on SARL are analysed. Compared with the conventional resolution defined by ambiguity function, the SARL reflects the practical resolution ability of radar and can provide an optimization criterion for radar system design.	ambiguity function;angularjs;mathematical optimization;radar;sarl language;signal-to-noise ratio;systems design;ultra-wideband	Xiaoli Zhou;Hongqiang Wang;Yongqiang Cheng;Yuliang Qin;Haowen Chen;Bin Sun	2014	2014 IEEE 8th Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop (SAM)	10.1109/SAM.2014.6882452	continuous-wave radar;radar engineering details;space-time adaptive processing;passive radar;bistatic radar;low probability of intercept radar;pulse repetition frequency;pulse-doppler radar;mathematics;optics;radar imaging;sensor array;statistics	Robotics	51.82275182638596	10.84525239906281	92719

There is a problem with commonly accepted parameters for microcirculation. This problem is due to many used mathematical models. The aim of notes to reveal that hypothesis about stochasticity of microflow leads to the uniqueness of mathematical equations for passage throughout microcirculation. Thus stochasticity could be a motivation for the choice of parameters of microcirculation. Method. The passage throughout microcirculation is formed by next five events: (1) be in intravascular space, (2) be in extravascular space, (3) a microvessel is closed, (4) a microvessel is open, and also (5) a particle, being in open microvessel, experiences a variation of velocity. Result: Markovian property leads to a uniqueness of distributions of named events and (a) the first four events are exponentially distributed; (b) the distribution of time to pass through open microvessels is infinitely divisible and is a gamma distribution.	emoticon;infinite divisibility;mathematical model;stochastic process;velocity (software development)	Victor Kislukhin	2014			microcirculation;statistical physics;uniqueness;mathematical model;mathematics;theoretical physics;dilution	ML	42.92001853482526	10.733388918271178	92895

By introducing linear compression and quantization to a small number of bits, sensor measurements can be communicated to the fusion center with minimal bandwidth requirements. Strengths of data- and model-driven approaches are combined to develop estimators capable of incorporating multiple forms of spectral and propagation prior information while fitting the rapid variations of shadow fading across space. To this end, novel nonparametric and semiparametric formulations are investigated. It is shown that PSD maps can be obtained using support vector machine-type solvers. In addition to batch approaches, an online algorithm attuned to real-time operation is developed. Numerical tests assess the performance of the novel algorithms.	map;model-driven architecture;numerical method;online algorithm;radio frequency;real-time clock;requirement;semiparametric model;sensor;software propagation;spectral density;support vector machine	Daniel Romero;Seung-Jun Kim;Georgios B.

cb94e8a6e7d41d7bf41944817436e4440d6d2476	an asymptotic simultaneous diagonalization procedure for pattern recognition	pattern recognition	The problem of classifying an observation into one of several different covariance matrices, of Toeplitz type, is considered. These matrices occur when the observation consists of uniformly spaced samples from a weakly stationary stochastic process. The usual Bayes procedure for this problem, assuming Gaussian distributions and a zero-one loss function, partitions the sample space with quadratic forms and is very difficult to implement. An asymptotic simultaneous diagonalization procedure (ASDP) is introduced which, in an asymptotic sense, simultaneously diagonalizes all of the covariance matrices. This result is valid regardless of whether the Gaussian assumption is made. A classification method based on the ASDP is proposed which can be used regardless of whether the Gaussian assumption holds. In the Gaussian case it is shown, using the theory of Toeplitz forms, that the performance of the ASDP classification system compares very favorably, in an asymptotic sense, with that of the optimum, and more complicated, Bayes procedure. The ASDP classification system has considerable appeal from an engineering standpoint. The system essentially estimates the sampled power spectrum by applying the observation to a bank of orthogonal, and uniformly spaced, narrow-band filters. This estimate is weighted by values of sampled power spectra and combined with bias terms in order to obtain a classification decision. A comparison of the present results with some related work of Price and Kailath is also given.	asymptote;loss function;pattern recognition;spectral density;stationary process;statistical classification;stochastic process;toeplitz hash algorithm	Jack Capon	1965	Information and Control	10.1016/S0019-9958(65)90205-6	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;computer science;mathematics;statistics	ML	50.22027472985939	12.68439561398517	93661

Starting with k balls, we are interested in the properties of E[N(p, k)], the expected time until all balls merge into one. We derive both upper and lower bounds for E[N(p, k)], some asymptotic results, and show that P{N(p, k) t}, and thus E[N(p, k)], is a Schur concave function of p.

These transforms render the dependent random variables describing the urn occupancies into independent random variables with appropriate distributions. This simplifies the analysis of a large number of problems for which a function under investigation depends on the urn occupancies. The approach used for constructing the transforms involves generating functions of combinatorial numbers. We also show, by using Tauberian theorems derived in this paper, that under certain conditions the asymptotic expressions of target functions in the transform domain are identical to the asymptotic expressions in the inverse–transform domain. Therefore, asymptotic information about certain statistics can be gained without evaluating the inverse transform.		Olgica Milenkovic;Kevin J.

His central result is that the posterior of his universal semimeasure M converges rapidly to the true sequence generating posterior μ, if the latter is computable. Hence, M is eligible as a universal predictor in case of unknown μ. We investigate the existence and convergence of computable universal (semi)measures for a hierarchy of computability classes: finitely computable, estimable, enumerable, and approximable. For instance, M is known to be enumerable, but not finitely computable, and to dominate all enumerable semimeasures. We define seven classes of (semi)measures based on these four computability concepts. Each class may or may not contain a (semi)measure which dominates all elements of another class. The analysis of these 49 cases can be reduced to four basic cases, two of them being new. The results hold for discrete and continuous semimeasures. We also investigate more closely the types of convergence, possibly implied by universality: in difference and in ratio, with probability 1, in mean sum, and for Martin-Löf random sequences. We introduce a generalized concept of randomness for individual sequences and use it to exhibit difficulties regarding these issues.	algorithmic information theory;computability;computable function;dominating set;enumerated type;inductive reasoning;kerrison predictor;occam's razor;randomness;rate of convergence;ray solomonoff;universality probability;occam	Marcus Hutter	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-39624-6_24	discrete mathematics;algorithmic probability;solomonoff's theory of inductive inference;information theory;mixture distribution;computer science;artificial intelligence;inductive reasoning;random sequence;occam's razor;machine learning;mathematics;field theory;utm theorem;computability;algorithmics;computable function;computable number;recursive set;algorithm;algorithmic information theory;statistics;computable analysis	Theory	43.43431636863138	17.594046683473476	94273

In the context of asymmetric threats, the detection of an abnormal situation refers to the discovery of suspicious activities of a hostile nation or group out of noisy, scattered, and partial intelligence data. The problem becomes complex in a low signal-to-noise ratio environment, such as asymmetric threats, because the ldquosignalrdquo observations are far fewer than ldquonoiserdquo observations. Furthermore, the signal observations are ldquohiddenrdquo in the noise. In this paper, we illustrate the capabilities of hidden Markov models (HMMs), combined with feature-aided tracking, for the detection of asymmetric threats. A transaction-based probabilistic model is proposed to combine HMMs and feature-aided tracking. A procedure analogous to Page's test is used for the quickest detection of abnormal events. The simulation results show that our method is able to detect the modeled pattern of an asymmetric threat with a high performance as compared to a maximum likelihood-based data mining technique. Performance analysis shows that the detection of HMMs improves with increase in the complexity of HMMs (i.e., the number of states in an HMM).	anomaly detection;data mining;hidden markov model;markov chain;onset (audio);sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;statistical model	Satnam Singh;Haiying Tu;William Donat;Krishna R.

We show that if the drift coefficients α(1), α(2) are negative real numbers and diffusion coefficients σ(1), σ(2) are not equal to zero, then the stationary distributions of OU process with a two-state Markov switching have the density functions and the explicit Fourier transform of stationary density functions are obtained under some special cases. Furthermore, under some stronger assumptions for transition rate of the Markov chain, the Fourier transform of the density functions of stationary distribution can be approximated by where , πj is the invariant measure of Markov chain.

The sensor measurements may be random due to the underlying nature of the source and background or due to sensor errors or both. The detection problem is infer the presence of a source of unknown intensity and location based on sensor measurements. In the conventional approach, detection decisions are made at the individual sensors, which are then combined at the fusion center, for example using the majority rule. With increased communication and computation costs, we show that a more complex fusion algorithm based on measurements achieves better detection performance under smooth and non-smooth source intensity functions, Lipschitz conditions on probability ratios and a minimum packing number for the state-space. We show that these conditions for trade-offs between the cyber costs and physical detection performance are applicable for two detection problems: (i) Poisson radiation sources amidst background radiation, and (ii) sources and background with Gaussian distributions.	algorithm;computation;sensor;set packing;state space	Nageswara S.

b1aa4b6794a7e924653afc8ba009a32eb9a036a6	fast random integer generation in an interval		In simulations, probabilistic algorithms and statistical tests, we often generate random integers in an interval (e.g., [0, s)). For example, random integers in an interval are essential to the Fisher-Yates random shuffle. Consequently, popular languages like Java, Python, C++, Swift and Go include ranged random integer generation functions as part of their runtime libraries. Pseudo-random values are usually generated in words of a fixed number of bits (e.g., 32 bits, 64 bits) using algorithms such as a linear congruential generator. We need functions to convert such randomwords to random integers in an interval ([0, s)) without introducing statistical biases. The standard functions in programming languages such as Java involve integer divisions. Unfortunately, division instructions are relatively expensive. We review an unbiased function to generate ranged integers from a source of random words that avoids integer divisions with high probability. To establish the practical usefulness of the approach, we show that this algorithm can multiply the speed of unbiased random shuffling on x64 processors. Our proposed approach has been adopted by the Go language for its implementation of the shuffle function.

This analysis process supports all of the comhinators of the PEPA algebra and is well suited to systems with large numbers of replicated components. The paper presents an elegant procedure for the generation of the ODEs and compares the results of this analysis with more conventional methods.	approximation;markov chain;pepa;process calculus;stochastic process;whole earth 'lectronic link	Jane Hillston	2005	Second International Conference on the Quantitative Evaluation of Systems (QEST'05)	10.1109/QEST.2005.12	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	SE	44.18950600530719	8.749371786163557	94908

We consider a group of sensors transmitting their observations to a fusion center. The fusion center considers the output of only one randomly chosen sensor at the time, and performs a sequential hypothesis test. We study a sequential multiple hypothesis test with randomized sensor selection strategy. We incorporate the random processing times of the sensors to determine the asymptotic performance characteristics of this test. For three distinct performance metrics, we show that, for a generic set of sensors and binary hypothesis, the time-optimal policy requires the fusion center to consider at most two sensors. We also show that for the case of multiple hypothesis, the time-optimal policy needs at most as many sensors to be observed as the number of underlying hypotheses.	randomized algorithm;randomness;sensor;transmitter	Vaibhav Srivastava;Kurt Plarre;Francesco Bullo	2011	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2011.2106777	fractional programming;programming;econometrics;statistical hypothesis testing;index term;decision support system;metric;linear-fractional programming;information theory;linear programming;signal processing;mathematics;sensor fusion;accuracy and precision;software testing;multiple comparisons problem;algorithm;sonar;statistics	Mobile	47.21270606489452	6.593740515851448	95102
0e130906680ffa8e29d9b9b8257d85e9345dff0b	solution and analysis of tdoa localization of a near or distant source in closed form		Point positioning and direction of arrival (DOA) localization require separate estimators, depending on whether the source is near or distant from the sensors. The use of modified polar representation (MPR) for the source location enables the integration of the two estimators together and eliminates the knowledge needed if the source is in the near-field or far-field. The previous work on MPR only provides an iterative implementation of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) initialized by a coarse semidefinite relaxation (SDR) solution. This paper proposes a formulation for time difference of arrival (TDOA) localization of a 2-D or 3-D source in MPR that would lead to a closed-form solution through the minimization of a quadratic function with a quadratic constraint. Two techniques, the successive unconstrained minimization (SUM) and the generalized trust region subproblem (GTRS), are applied to solve the optimization. Detailed analysis in the first order for mean-square and in the second order for estimation bias is performed for both methods. The theoretical results illustrate that the closed-form solution from each of the methods provides the Cramér–Rao lower bound performance for Gaussian noise. The GTRS solution has better accuracy than the SUM solution when the source signal is arriving at an azimuth or elevation angle close to zero, 90$^\circ$, or 180$^\circ$ or when the measurement noise level is large. They yield comparable performance with the MLE albeit having less complexity and avoiding possible divergence behavior. They outperform the closed-form solutions from the literature in angle estimation and have smaller bias.		Yimao Sun;K. C.

We first show that the fundamental limit on the number of histogram queries, m, so that the entire data set of size n can be extracted losslessly, is m = Θ(n/log n), sub-linear in the size of the data set. For proving the lower bound (converse), we use standard arguments based on simple counting. For proving the upper bound (achievability), we proposed two query mechanisms. The first mechanism is random sampling, where in each query, the items to be included in the queried subset are uniformly randomly selected. With random sampling, it is shown that the entire data set can be extracted with vanishing error probability using Ω(n/log n) queries. The second one is a non-adaptive deterministic algorithm. With this algorithm, it is shown that the entire data set can be extracted exactly (no error) using Ω(n/log n) queries. We then extend the results to arithmetic mean queries, and show that for data sets taking values in a real-valued finite arithmetic progression, the fundamental limit on the number of arithmetic mean queries to extract the entire data set is also Θ(n/log n).	color gradient;deterministic algorithm;lossless compression;mean squared error;monte carlo method;randomness;sampling (signal processing)	I.-Hsiang Wang;Shao-Lun Huang;Kuan-Yun Lee;Kwang-Cheng Chen	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541526	discrete mathematics;weighted arithmetic mean;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	Theory	47.1439577687177	11.035999097719474	95498

a854d6ae1f83b451589608f2d0db247e380af8f0	percolation and cascade dynamics of spatial networks with partial dependency		Recently, it has been shown that the removal of a random fraction of nodes from a system of interdependent spatial networks can lead to cascading failures which amplify the original damage and destroy the entire system, often via abrupt first-order transitions. For these distinctive phenomena to emerge, the interdependence between networks need not be total. We consider here a system of partially interdependent spatial networks (modelled as lattices) with a fraction q of the nodes interdependent and the remaining 1 − q autonomous. In our model, the dependency links between networks are of geometric length less than r. Under full dependency (q = 1), this system was shown to have a first-order percolation transition if r > rc ≈ 8. Here, we generalize this result and show that for all q > 0, there will be a first-order transition if r > rc(q). We show that rc(q) increases monotonically with decreasing q and limq→0+ rc(q) = ∞. Additionally, we present a detailed description and explanation of the cascading failures in spatially embedded interdependent networks near the percolation threshold pc. These failures follow three mechanisms depending on the value of r. Below rc the system undergoes a continuous transition similar to standard percolation on a lattice. Above rc there are two distinct first-order transitions for finite and infinite r, respectively. The cascading failure for finite r is characterized by the emergence of a critical hole which then spreads through the system while the infinite r transition is more similar to the case of random networks. Surprisingly, we find that this spreading transition can still occur even if p < pc. We present measurements of cascade dynamics which differentiate between these phase transitions and elucidate their mechanisms. These results extend previous research on spatial networks to the more realistic case of partial dependency and shed new light on the specific dynamics of dependencydriven cascading failures.	autonomous robot;cascading failure;embedded system;emergence;first-order predicate;flow network;interdependence;interdependent networks;lattice graph;percolation threshold;rc circuit;spatial network	Michael M.

In this paper we investigate neighborhood collaboration based distributed cooperative localization of all sensors in a particular network with the so-called `convex hull constraint': all nodes in such a network are either position-known anchors or sensors to be localized, and every sensor is inside the convex hull of its neighbors. For such a practically widely seen thus important class of localizable wireless sensor networks, we propose three iterative self-positioning algorithms, for independent implementation at all individual sensors of the considered network. Analysis and simulation study show that when iteratively running at all sensors of the considered network, i) the first one of our proposed iterative self-positioning algorithms leads to global convergence, where the converged solution is the correct positions of all sensors in the absence of measurement error, but might not be optimum if there exist measurement errors; ii) the second algorithm suffers from local convergence, but once correctly converged the converged solution would be the least squares (LS) solution; iii) the third algorithm, a combined version that switches between the former two algorithms' iterations efficiently and independently at individual sensors based on locally collected information, globally converges to the LS solution, as long as the measurement errors are sufficiently small such that the converged solution by the first algorithm is well inside the correctly converging area of the second algorithm.	algorithm;convex hull;existential quantification;iteration;least squares;local convergence;network switch;sensor;simulation	Shouhong Zhu;Zhiguo Ding	2011	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2011.051311.100698	simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;brooks–iyengar algorithm	Mobile	51.51053331506308	4.602647802922633	96142

Aiming at a resource efficient solution, we advocate the use of sensors that maintain their location information and rely on the tracking service only when their locations change. In the proposed approach, the tracked node transmits a signal and infrastructure nodes measure the Doppler shifts of the transmitted signal. We show that Mica2 motes can measure RF Doppler shifts with 0.2 Hz accuracy corresponding to a 0.14 m/s error in relative speed estimates using radio inter-ferometric technique.  The tracking problem is modeled as a non-linear optimization problem and an extended Kalman filter is used to solve it accurately assuming Gaussian measurement errors. However, this approach may fail if the tracked node changes its speed or direction. We propose to update the Kalman filter state by performing constrained least-squares optimization when a maneuver is detected. The combined approach achieves almost a 50% accuracy improvement over the Kalman filter alone when the mobile node changes its direction and speed frequently. We describe our proof-of-concept implementation of the tracking service and evaluate its performance experimentally and in simulation.	doppler effect;experiment;extended kalman filter;least squares;linear programming;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;radio frequency;sensor;simulation	Branislav Kusy;Ákos Lédeczi;Xenofon D.

7e40c07ed2a8c7f5e133d2b13f733cbb7441d38f	the properties of random trees	random tree	Consider an s-ary tree (in which every node has no more than s children). Each node holds a single datum, including a key. These are the oaaupied, internal, or aZosed nodes of the data-structure. Augment the tree, following D. E. Knuth, by adding a set of unoaaupied, ezternaZ, open, or free nodes, so that every internal node now has just s children and every external node has no children. We assume that there is an unambiguous rule, depending only on the key-values at the internal nodes of the tree, whereby a new datum, with a new key value, will be inserted at one of the external nodes; this node then becomes internal and acquires s new external nodes as children. We further assume that the rule and the statistical distribution of data are such that every external node has equal probability of being selected for insertion of a new datum, at every stage. Various statistics of such trees are now obtained explicitly, in a systematic manner which may be extended to higher moments. The principal result is that the average ZeveZ of both internal and external nodes in a given tree is asymptotic in probability to s 8 _ 1 log m as m + =, where m is the number of internal nodes in the tree. Since the (with m = corresponding average level for a k-level fully balanced tree k s 1) k 1 is asymptotic to log m = 1 log m as m ~ =, we s 1 s og s conclude that, unless the distribution-of data is far from the rather plausible assumption made here, it is highly improbable that the considerable cost of rebalancing trees when constructing data-bases will ever be iustified in practice.

A crucial factor seems to be the ability to represent relations between two (or more) sources of information jointly as quantum information. In analogy to the behaviour of physical conjugate variables, we define conjugate information variables, with the property that whenever one of them is highly predictable the other one is unpredictable and vice versa. As an example, consider a classification task to decide whether a function is locally constant, rising, falling or minimum or maximum, in the presence of noise.	algorithm;conjugate variables;image processing;information security;information theory;quantum information;semantics (computer science);signal processing	Michael Nölle;Martin Suda	2011	CoRR		probability amplitude;quantum operation;computer vision;markov chain;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;quantum information;metric;quantum t-design;computer science;triangle inequality;euclidean distance;fidelity of quantum states;mathematics;geometry;sensor fusion;image segmentation;quantum channel;trace distance;data analysis;distance;quantum algorithm;quantum phase estimation algorithm	Theory	45.715258061917766	17.209857932081558	96251

In this work, a model for TDOA bias is developed considering the time of arrival was estimated using the fixed threshold algorithm, as well as theoretical upper and lower bounds for it. In addition, we derive the time of arrival probability distribution function in terms of the noise distribution and acoustic emission waveform for the fixed threshold algorithm, showing that, contrary to usual practice, it in general cannot be well approximated by a Gaussian distribution.

Rotational invariance generates the Gaussian distribution. Particular scaling relations transform the canonical exponential and Gaussian patterns into the variety of commonly observed patterns. The scaling relations themselves arise from the fundamental invariances of shift, stretch and rotation, plus a few additional invariances. Prior work described the three fundamental invariances as a consequence of the equilibrium canonical ensemble of statistical mechanics or the Jaynesian maximization of information entropy. By contrast, I emphasize the primacy and sufficiency of invariance alone to explain the commonly observed patterns. Primary invariance naturally creates the array of commonly observed scaling relations and associated probability patterns, whereas the classical approaches derived from statistical mechanics or information theory require special assumptions to derive commonly observed scales.	entropy (information theory);expectation–maximization algorithm;image scaling;information theory;primacy of mind;time complexity	Steven A.

Our measures depend on three parameters including an analog of the β parameter in random matrix models. Under an appropriate limit transition as n → ∞, our measures converge to certain limit measures, which are of the same nature as one– dimensional log–gas with arbitrary β > 0. The first main result says that averages of products of “characteristic polynomials” with respect to the limit measures are given by the multivariate hypergeometric functions of type (2,0). The second main result is a computation of the limit correlation functions for the even values of β.	computation;converge;image scaling;polynomial	Alexei Borodin;Grigori Olshanski	2005	Eur. J.

Based on a set-theoretic formulation of the problem, we seek an estimate that maximizes the complementary squared Mahalanobis “distance” between the local and the desired estimates in a logarithmic average form, and the optimal value turns out to be the analytic center. For our problem, we then prove that the analytic center is a convex combination of the local estimates. As such, our proposed analytic center covariance intersection (AC-CI) algorithm could be regarded as the covariance intersection (CI) algorithm with respect to a set-theoretic optimization criteria.	algorithm;covariance intersection;cross-correlation;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;set theory	Yimin Wang;X.

In particular, we study the change in the relative entropy between two probability measures when both of them are perturbed by a small amount of the same additive noise. It is shown that the rate of the change with respect to the energy of the perturbation can be expressed in terms of the mean squared difference of the score functions of the two distributions, and, rather surprisingly, is unrelated to the distribution of the perturbation otherwise. The result holds true for the classical relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler distance), as well as two of its generalizations: Rényi's relative entropy and the f-divergence. The result generalizes a recent relationship between the relative entropy and mean squared errors pertaining to Gaussian noise models, which in turn supersedes many previous information-estimation relationships. A generalization of the de Bruijn identity to non-Gaussian models can also be regarded as consequence of this new result.	additive white gaussian noise;de bruijn graph;information theory;kullback–leibler divergence;utility functions on indivisible goods	Dongning Guo	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2009.5205652	additive white gaussian noise;combinatorics;quantum relative entropy;generalized relative entropy;binary entropy function;transfer entropy;maximum entropy probability distribution;principle of maximum entropy;pattern recognition;mathematics;joint quantum entropy;configuration entropy;kullback–leibler divergence;min entropy;statistics	Theory	46.260382363548054	14.960220603565732	97021
7f53e3d7b471090c08c6f2c5f35064548809c843	bounding the convergence time of local probabilistic evolution		Isoperimetric inequalities form a very intuitive yet powerful characterization of the connectedness of a state space, that has proven successful in obtaining convergence bounds. Since the seventies they form an essential tool in differential geometry [1,2], graph theory [4,3] and Markov chain analysis [8,5,6]. In this paper we use isoperimetric inequalities to construct a bound on the convergence time of any local probabilistic evolution that leaves its limit distribution invariant. We illustrate how this general result leads to new bounds on convergence times beyond the explicit Markovian setting, among others on quantum dynamics. This paper is concerned with the discrete-time spreading of a distribution along the edges of a graph. In essence we establish that even by exploiting global information about the graph and allowing a very general use of this information, this spreading can still not be accelerated beyond the conductance bound. Before providing more ample context, we start with a motivating example ascribed to Eugenio Calabi, but which came to our attention through the seminal 1969 paper by Jeff Cheeger [1]. Whereas the original example concerns differential geometry, we will apply it to a graph setting.	conductance (graph);graph theory;isoperimetric inequality;markov chain;quantum dynamics;state space	Simon Apers;Alain Sarlette;Francesco Ticozzi	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-68445-1_87	discrete mathematics;mathematics;graph theory;social connectedness;combinatorics;probabilistic logic;state space;strength of a graph;markov process;isoperimetric inequality;markov chain	Theory	42.69347033815288	9.842996831035958	97059

From simple ordering follow lattices, or, equivalently, algebras. Lattices admit a quantification, or, equivalently, algebras may be extended to calculi. The general rules of quantification are the sum and chain rules. Probability theory follows from a quantification on the specific lattice of statements that has an upper context. Inquiry calculus follows from a quantification on the specific lattice of questions that has a lower context. There will be given here a relevance measure and a product rule for relevances, which, taken together with the sum rule of relevances, will allow us to perform inquiry analyses in an algorithmic manner.	information theory;relevance;sum rule in quantum mechanics	H.

This kind of grand average provides a smoothing over all individual distributions for specific fixed order statistics. The grand distribution for the number of swaps (when suitably scaled) is a perpetuity (a sum of products of independent mixed continuous random variables supported on the interval (0,1)). The tool for this proof is contraction in the Wasserstein metric space, and identifying the limit as the fixed-point solution of a distributional equation. The same methodology carries over when Quick Select is commissioned to find an extremal order statistic (of a relatively small or relatively large rank) and the results are of similar nature. It is one of our purposes to show that analysis under different partition algorithms leads to different results.	select (sql);selection algorithm	Hosam M. Mahmoud	2010	Theor. Comput.

The second model is a geometric Lévy process where the small jumps are truncated or replaced by a Brownian motion which is appropriately scaled. To prove the robustness of the quadratic hedging strategies we use pricing and hedging formulas based on Fourier transform techniques.

038374572ed6cde274c9ccd2f5cb0904a8678ac6	heterogeneous bounds of confidence: meet, discuss and find consensus!	social simulation	Models of continuous opinion dynamics under bounded confidence show a sharp transition between a consensus and a polarization phase at a critical global bound of confidence. In this paper, heterogeneous bounds of confidence for agents are studied. The surprising result is that a society of agents with two different bounds of confidence (open minded and closed minded agents) can find consensus even when both bounds of confidence are below the critical bound of confidence of a homogeneous society. The phenomenon is shown by numerical computation of the time evolution of the agents density in the opinion interval. We compute this for the two most popular bounded confidence models: the model of Deffuant, Weisbuch and others (DW), and the model of Hegselmann and Krause (HK). In the DW model agents meet in random pairwise encounters and each agent moves to the average of their opinions if the other’s opinion is closer than her bound of confidence to her own opinion. In the HK model each agent moves to the average opinion of all opinions in her area of confidence which is defined by her bound of confidence. The drawback of the better chances for consensus due to heterogeneity in the bounds of confidence is that the opinion dynamics gets suspect to severe drifts of clusters. This is demonstrated by examples. ∗Universität Bremen, Bibliothekstrasse, 28359 Bremen, Germany, math@janlo.de; present adress: ETH Zurich, Chair of Systems Design, Kreuzplatz 5, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland, jalorenz@ethz.ch	cluster analysis;computation;dreamwidth;intel mcs-51;mathematical model;numerical analysis;polarization (waves);simulation;software agent;switzerland;systems design	Jan Lorenz	2010	Complexity	10.1002/cplx.20295	combinatorics;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;mathematics;social simulation;algorithm;statistics	ML	42.7130159975232	10.458411541058837	97924

The acknowledged benefits of using separate transmitters in active sensing are often undermined by the difficulty in accurate synchronisation of the receiver and the transmitters. In this work, we propose a solution that is based on measurements from non-cooperative objects in the illuminated region. We formulate the problem as parameter estimation in a state space model with individual transmitter channel data cubes as measurements. For maximum likelihood estimation, we use an expectation maximisation type iterative bound optimisation using distributions found by track-before-detect together with explicit formulae derived here for the related score function for chirp waveforms. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of achieving very high accuracy with errors on the order of small fractions of the pulse width thereby enabling coherent processing in bi-static channels.	chirp;coherence (physics);estimation theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;iterative method;mathematical optimization;olap cube;pulse-width modulation;radar;staring array;state space;state-space representation;track-before-detect;transmitter	Kimin Kim;Murat Üney;Bernard Mulgrew	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461825	radar tracker;mathematical optimization;transmitter;electronic engineering;estimation theory;track-before-detect;chirp;staring array;computer science;communication channel;pulse-width modulation	Robotics	52.205519598639384	7.511546996915624	98461

These results guarantee that if a uniform quantizer of step size δ is used to quantize m measurements y = Φx of a k-sparse signal x ∈ RN , where Φ satisfies the restricted isometry property, then the approximate recovery x# via `1-minimization is within O(δ) of x. The simplest and commonly assumed approach is to quantize each measurement independently. In this paper, we show that if instead an rth order Σ∆ quantization scheme with the same output alphabet is used to quantize y, then there is an alternative recovery method via Sobolev dual frames which guarantees a reduction of the approximation error by a factor of (m/k)(r−1/2)α for any 0 < α < 1, if m &r k(logN)1/(1−α). The result holds with high probability on the initial draw of the measurement matrix Φ from the Gaussian distribution, and uniformly for all k-sparse signals x that satisfy a mild size condition on their supports.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;compressed sensing;delta-sigma modulation;quantization (signal processing);restricted isometry property;romberg's method;sparse matrix;with high probability	C.

The physiological data to be sampled can be non-stationary, with bursts of high amplitude and frequency content providing most information. Such data could be sampled efficiently with a non-uniform schedule that increases the sampling rate only during activity bursts.   METHODS A real time and adaptive algorithm is proposed to select the sampling rate, in order to reduce the number of measured samples, but still recording the main information. The algorithm is based on a neural network which predicts the subsequent samples and their uncertainties, requiring a measurement only when the risk of the prediction is larger than a selectable threshold.   RESULTS Four examples of application to biomedical data are discussed: electromyogram, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and body acceleration. Sampling rates are reduced under the Nyquist limit, still preserving an accurate representation of the data and of their power spectral densities (PSD). For example, sampling at 60% of the Nyquist frequency, the percentage average rectified errors in estimating the signals are on the order of 10% and the PSD is fairly represented, until the highest frequencies. The method outperforms both uniform sampling and compressive sensing applied to the same data.   CONCLUSION The discussed method allows to go beyond Nyquist limit, still preserving the information content of non-stationary biomedical signals. It could find applications in body sensor networks to lower the number of wireless communications (saving sensor power) and to reduce the occupation of memory.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive sampling;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;compressed sensing;compression;electrocardiography;electroencephalography;electromyography;estimated;experiment;large;nonuniform sampling;nuclear power plants;nyquist frequency;nyquist rate;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;patients;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;schedule (document type);self-information;sensor;stationary process;density	Luca Mesin	2016	Computers in biology and medicine	10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.02.004	nyquist frequency;computer vision;telecommunications;computer science;compressed sensing;accelerometer;statistics	Mobile	50.93783061816668	16.71296738341405	98817

This algorithm was shown to be asymptotically optimal and to have good trade-off curves. In this paper, the results in [1] are extended to the more practically relevant minimax setting. Motivated by the structure of the algorithm developed in [1], a CUSUM based algorithm, called DE-CUSUM is proposed, which can be used for on-off observation control and to detect change as quickly as possible subject to a false alarm constraint. It is shown that the DE-CUSUM algorithm inherits the good qualities of the algorithm in [1], i.e., it is also asymptotically optimal and has good trade-off curves. Numerical results show that the DE-CUSUM algorithm provides a substantial savings in the observation cost over the naive approach of fractional sampling.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;minimax;numerical method;sampling (signal processing);switch	Taposh Banerjee;Venugopal V.

First, the mixing matrix, which contains all azimuth information of signal sources, is estimated by independent component analysis. Afterward, several parameter equations are established upon the new mixing matrix. Finally, all DOAs of coherent and uncorrelated signals are estimated by solving these equations. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed method has higher angle resolution and estimation accuracy. Moreover, the signal number resolved by our approach can exceed the number of array elements. Simulation results have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed method.	coherence (physics);direction of arrival;independent computing architecture	Guang-wei Ma;Zhi-Chao Sha;Zhang-Meng Liu;Zhi-Tao Huang	2014	Signal, Image and Video Processing	10.1007/s11760-013-0553-z	econometrics;mathematics;statistics	EDA	52.376280536384364	7.396025999789134	99031

The detector is derived by modelling the noise process as consisting of two components, Gaussian noise and impulsive noise. The impulsive noise is modelled using a uniform distribution that appears with a certain probability. A convenient approximation using the max operator is then applied to the resulting probability density function to gain mathematical tractability. The performance of the proposed detector is analysed theoretically and the results of the theoretical analysis are verified in our simulation study.	algorithm;approximation;cognitive radio;simulation	Tõnu Trump;Ivo Muursepp	2011	2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140004	gradient noise;gaussian noise;mathematical optimization;detector;probability density function;cognitive radio;noise temperature;impulse noise;computer science;noise measurement;noise;shot noise;probability;noise;mathematics;uniform distribution;noise floor;statistics;robustness;approximation theory	Embedded	51.02093660789117	11.52883010287631	99261

We suggest using a generalization of Gerschgorin's theorem developed for the eigenvalue problem Ax = λBx. This generalization can be applied to the perturbation of multiple eigenvalues and the usual theorem of Gerschgorin appears only as a particular case. For this, we need defining regions that bound a distance called the chordal metric. The techniques of diagonalization based on unitary transformation are necessary to exploit the estimated covariance matrix too. With sinusoidal signals embedded in a colored noise, the used criterion GDEdist with this generalization shows a better detection rate compared to that obtained by the simple Gerschgorin theorem.	colors of noise;embedded system;perturbation theory;the matrix	Olivier Caspary	2002	2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference		combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;mathematics	ML	51.559682654110276	14.584708369071079	99420

The system's core-dynamic is described by a recurrent fuzzy system, while further known influencing features are summarized via probability theory using a stochastic automaton. The appropriate conditional probabilities are used to adapt the dynamics of the recurrent fuzzy system depending on its state variables. By allowing transient conditional probabilities, a time-variance is simultaneously achieved. Thus, the developed transient probabilistic recurrent fuzzy system (TP-RFS) is able to handle two kinds of uncertain information (vague and stochastic) and allows slight as well as drastic adaptations of the original recurrent fuzzy system's dynamics. Successful applications of the proposed TP-RFS for modeling different dynamics of an ecological system and for controlling the speed signaling on a highway are shown.	automaton;conditional entropy;ecosystem;fuzzy control system;remote file sharing;stochastic process;vagueness	Klaus J.

In comparison to the well-known subspace algorithms such as MUSIC, the proposed method has several advantages. First, in contrast to MUSIC, no forward/backward spatial smoothing for the covariance matrix is needed in the case of coherent sources. Second, the proposed method is more suitable for realtime implementation since it only requires one or a few snapshots in order to provide an accurate DOA estimation, whereas MUSIC requires a large number of snapshots. Third, the proposed method exploits the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of a real-valued covariance matrix thereby reducing the computational cost by at least a factor of four. Simulation results show that the proposed method can estimate the DO As of the incident sources with high accuracy even when the sources are coherent.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;coherent;computation;direction of arrival;kernel density estimation;simulation;smoothing;whole earth 'lectronic link	Nizar Tayem;Mort Naraghi-Pour	2007	2007 IEEE 66th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2007.126	covariance matrix;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;multiple signal classification;music;mathematics;direction of arrival;antenna array;statistics	Robotics	53.32120020033486	7.791865269797942	100119

The material of interest is modelled by a random environment and the charge carrier is modelled by a random walker. The framework combines a model for the fast generation of random environments that realistically mimic materials morphology with an algorithm for efficient estimation of key properties of the resulting random walk. The model of the environment makes use of tools from spatial statistics and the theory of random geometric graphs. More precisely, the disordered medium is represented by a random spatial graph with directed edge weights, where the edge weights represent the transition rates of a Markov Jump Process (MJP) modelling the motion of the random walker. This MJP is a multiscale stochastic process. In the long term, it explores all vertices of the random graph model. In the short term, however, it becomes trapped in small subsets of the state space and makes many transitions in these small regions. This behaviour makes efficient estimation of velocity by Monte Carlo simulations a challenging task. Therefore, we use Aggregate Monte Carlo (AMC), introduced in Brereton et al. (2014), for estimating the velocity of a random walker as it passes through a realisation of the random environment. In this paper, we prove the strong consistency of the AMC velocity estimator and use this result to conduct a detailed case study, in which we describe the motion of holes in an amorphous mesophase of an organic semiconductor, dicyanovinyl-substituted oligothiophene (DCV4T). In particular, we analyse the effect of system size (i.e. number of molecules) on the velocity of single charge carriers.	advanced mezzanine card;aggregate function;amiga walker;directed graph;markov chain;mathematical morphology;modernist journals project;monte carlo method;rado graph;random geometric graph;random graph;random walker algorithm;semiconductor;simulation;spatial analysis;state space;stochastic process;strong consistency;velocity (software development);vertex (graph theory)	Ole Stenzel;Christian Hirsch;Tim J.

4be416a822c26cf115aa7aba6acda68232beb3b7	wigner matrices, the moments of roots of hermite polynomials and the semicircle law		Abstract   In the present paper we give two alternate proofs of the well known theorem that the empirical distribution of the appropriately normalized roots of the   n  th monic Hermite polynomial     H    n     converges weakly to the semicircle law, which is also the weak limit of the empirical distribution of appropriately normalized eigenvalues of a Wigner matrix. In the first proof–based on the recursion satisfied by the Hermite polynomials–we show that the generating function of the moments of roots of     H    n     is convergent and it satisfies a fixed point equation, which is also satisfied by   c   (    z    2    )   , where   c   (  z  )    is the generating function of the Catalan numbers     C    k    . In the second proof we compute the leading and the second leading term of the   k  th moments (as a polynomial in   n  ) of     H    n     and show that the first one coincides with     C    k  /  2    , the    (  k  /  2  )   th Catalan number, where   k   is even and the second one is given by   −   (    2    2  k  −  1    −   (    2  k  −  1    k    )   )   . We also mention the known result that the expectation of the characteristic polynomial (    p    n    ) of a Wigner random matrix is exactly the Hermite polynomial (    H    n    ), i.e.   E    p    n     (  x  )   =    H    n     (  x  )   , which suggests the presence of a deep connection between the Hermite polynomials and Wigner matrices.	hermite polynomials;polynomial	Miklós Kornyik;György Michaletzky	2016	Journal of Approximation Theory	10.1016/j.jat.2016.07.006	combinatorics;mathematical analysis;mathematics;wigner semicircle distribution;algebra	Theory	42.61683034983643	16.182986891365566	101360

Signals produced by samplers, scanners, multiplexors, and modulators are familiar examples. Often these signals are appropriately modeled by random processes that are cyclostationary (CS), i.e., processes with statistical parameters, such as mean and autocorrelation, that fluctuate periodically with time. In this paper we examine two methods for representing nonstationary processes that reveal the special properties possessed by CS processes. These representations are the harmonic series representation (HSR) and the translation series representation (TSR). We show that the HSR is particularly appropriate for characterizing the structural properties of CS processes and that the TSR provides natural models for many types of communication signal formats. The advantages gained by modeling signals as CS processes rather than stationary processes is illustrated by consideration of the optimum filtering problem. We present general solutions for filters that minimize mean-square error for continuous-waveform estimation, and we discuss several specific examples for the particular case of additive noise. These examples demonstrate improvement in performance over that of filter designs based on stationary models for the signal processes.		William A. Gardner;L. E. Franks	1975	IEEE Trans.

This includes random arrays, binned random arrays, periodic thinning, element shadowing properties, and fractal arrays. The algorithmic optimization of layouts of 1-D and 2-D sparse arrays is presented and it is empirically derived that the peak sidelobe level for an array with K active elements is proportional to 1/K for a 1-D array and 2/K for a 2-D array. The constant of proportionality depends strongly on the width of the mainlobe relative to that of the full array. With an increase of 50%, the constant is 1.5.	array processing;sampling (signal processing);sparse	Sverre Holm	2000		10.1109/ICASSP.2000.860243	rule-based system;fractal;computer science;theoretical computer science;sensor array;statistics;sparse array	Arch	50.38950650076459	13.761322670947365	101937

70ead5c4b88a32f0977ea14b90509ef83444e6a1	on the order of random channel networks		The order of a stream with no tributaries is defined to be 1. In general, when two streams of orders $\alpha $ and $\beta $ flow together, the larger stream thus produced has order $\max \{ \alpha ,\beta \}$ or $\alpha + 1$, according as $\alpha \ne \beta $ or $\alpha = \beta $. The order $\Omega $ of a river network $\mathcal{N}$ is the order of the highest ordered stream in $\mathcal{N}$. Our object is to investigate the distribution of $\Omega $ for random networks with n sources. It follows from our results that the distribution of $\Omega $ is very highly concentrated about $1 + \frac{1}{2}\log_2 n$.		Amram Meir;John W. Moon;J. R. Pounder	1980	SIAM J.

This approximating DM should maintain the mean and some higherorder moments and should homogeneously cover the support of the original density. Homogeneous approximations require redundancy, which means there are more Dirac components than necessary for fulfilling the moment constraints. Hence, some sort of regularization is required as the solution is no longer unique. Two types of regularizers are possible: The first type ensures smooth approximations, e.g., in a maximum entropy sense. The second type we pursue here ensures closeness of the approximating density to the given Gaussian. As standard distance measures are typically not well defined for discrete densities on continuous domains, we focus on shifting the mass distribution of the approximating density as close to the true density as possible. Instead of globally comparing the masses as in a previous paper, the key idea is to characterize individual Dirac components by kernel functions representing the spread of probability mass that is appropriate at a given location. A distance measure is then obtained by comparing the deviation between the true density and the induced kernel density. As a result, the approximation problem is converted to an optimization problem as we now minimize the distance under the desired moment constraints.	anytime algorithm;approximation;centrality;content-control software;dirac delta function;exptime;emoticon;interrupt;kalman filter;kernel panic;mathematical optimization;moment problem;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;optimization problem;random optimization;randomized algorithm;redundancy (engineering);sampling (signal processing);system identification	Uwe D.

The problem of choosing an optimum signal when no constraints are placed on the type of signals allowed is discussed briefly, but the remainder of the paper is restricted to signals and receiver impulse responses that are uniformly spaced, phase and amplitude-tapered pulse trains. Expressions for the signal-to-interference ratio obtained when a signal is used with its matched filter (pm/) and with the optimum filter or clutter filter (\rho_{cf}) are then derived together with an explicit expression for the clutter filter. An iterative technique for maximizing \rho_{cf} is devised. This scheme has the useful property that it generates a sequence of signals whose \rho_{cf} 's form a monotone, nondecreasing sequence. This is followed by an application of the calculus of variations to derive the Euler equations for the stationary points of \rho_{cf} and \rho_{mf} . The form of the Euler equations suggests iterative techniques for their solution; in fact, the technique suggested for the solution of the Euler equation associated with \rho_{cf} is essentially the iterative technique that was described above.	clutter;radar;rejection sampling	D.

The case of detecting gaussian targets with gaussian ACF and unknown one-lag correlation coefficient, ρs, in AWGN is considered. After proving the dependence of the simple hypothesis-testing problem LR detector on the assumed value of ρs, and the extreme complexity of the integral that involves the ALR detector, NNs are proposed as tools to approximate the ALR detector. NNs not only are capable of approximating this detector and its more robust performance with respect to ρs, but the implemented approximation is expected to have lower computational cost that other numerical approximations, a very important characteristic in real-time applications. MLPs of different sizes have been trained using a quasi-Newton algorithm to minimize the cross-entropy error. Results prove that MLPs with one hidden layer with 23 neurons can implement very robust detectors for TSNR values lower than 10dB.	acf;additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;automated lip reading;coefficient;computational complexity theory;cross entropy;lr parser;newton;numerical analysis;portable document format;quasi-newton method;radar;real-time clock;real-time computing;sensor	Pilar Jarabo Amores;David de la Mata-Moya;Manuel Rosa-Zurera;Jose Carlos Nieto-Borge;Francisco López-Ferreras	2005	2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference	10.1007/11550907_145	gaussian noise;additive white gaussian noise;speech recognition;formal methods;least mean squares filter;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;white noise;artificial neural network;statistics	ML	50.35910745000121	12.692570002942066	103509

By measuring the signal strength of all links of a network of sensor nodes, one can estimate the position of an attenuating object with reasonable precision. The sub-GHz is shown to be suitable for an implementation. Such a design is more energy efficient than a 2.4 GHz implementation. We adapt, evaluate, and improve the device-free localization method of Wilson and Patwari to indoor environments using the 800/900 MHz band. The advantage of using 800/900 MHz is reduced reflections compared to 2.4 GHz. At the same time, the signal is attenuated less by objects in its path. Thus, the methods of Wilson and Patwari needed to be refined and parameters needed to be adapted. We evaluate some combinations of the most common choices of norms to perform a Tikhonov regularisation. The first difference gradient operator with H1 norm works best. We equipped a 5 m×5 m room with 20 wireless sensor nodes. We evaluated the influence of the distance to walls and the height of nodes. The radio tomographic image are post-processed by filters to make likely positions of objects more apparent. Additional parameters values suggested by Wilson and Patwari could not be used for the new frequency and hardware. For example, the ellipse excess path length has been experimentally determined to be close to 20 cm instead of 2 cm. In our experiments-up, we achieve an a maximum average localisation error below of 78 cm. With this work, we have reproduced the results of Wilson and Patwari, adapted it to a different frequency in the 800/900 MHz band and developed improvements to the original algorithms.	algorithm;amiga reflections;computation;experiment;filter (signal processing);finite difference;gradient;matrix multiplication;offset binary;pixel;polynomial texture mapping;reflection (computer graphics);reflection (computer programming);run time (program lifecycle phase);run-time infrastructure (simulation);tomography;xfig	Stephan Adler;Simon Schmitt;Marcel Kyas	2014	2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)	10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275527	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;optics	Robotics	50.514232768811056	4.532818246300368	103630

The Poisson noise model is appropriate for a variety of applications, including low-light imaging and digital streaming, where the signal-independent and/or bounded noise models used in the compressed sensing literature are no longer applicable. In this paper, we develop a novel sensing paradigm based on expander graphs and propose a MAP algorithm for recovering sparse or compressible signals from Poisson observations. The geometry of the expander graphs and the positivity of the corresponding sensing matrices play a crucial role in establishing the bounds on the signal reconstruction error of the proposed algorithm. The geometry of the expander graphs makes them provably superior to random dense sensing matrices, such as Gaussian or partial Fourier ensembles, for the Poisson noise model.We support our results with experimental demonstrations.	algorithm;compressed sensing;map;programming paradigm;shot noise;signal reconstruction;sparse matrix	Sina Jafarpour;Rebecca M Willett;Maxim Raginsky;A.

32fd296b205b13c62816c6fdfa44d6856a3cb61b	a new approach of deriving bounds between entropy and error from joint distribution: case study for binary classifications		The existing upper and lower bounds between entropy and error are mostly derived through an inequality means without linking to joint distributions. In fact, from either theoretical or application viewpoint, there exists a need t o achieve a complete set of interpretations to the bounds in relation t o joint distributions. For this reason, in this work we propose a new approach of deriving the bounds between entropy and erro r from a joint distribution. The specific case study is given on binary classifications, which can justify the need of the proposed approach. Two basic types of classification errors are inves tigated, namely, the Bayesian and non-Bayesian errors. For both erro rs, we derive the closed-form expressions of upper bound and low er bound in relation to joint distributions.

In this paper, we consider the problem of determining, from a finite number of independent vector observations, whether a quaternion Gaussian vector is proper or not. Specifically, we derive three generalized likelihood ratio tests (GLRTs) for testing the two main kinds of quaternion properness and show that the GLRTs reduce to the estimation of three previously proposed quaternion improperness measures. Interestingly, the three GLRT statistics (improperness measures) can be interpreted as an estimate of the entropy loss due to the quaternion improperness. Additionally, we analyze the case in which the orthogonal basis for the representation of the quaternion vector is unknown, which results in the problem of estimating the principal \BBC-properness direction, i.e., the pure unit quaternion minimizing the \BBC -improperness measure. Although this estimation problem is not convex, we propose a technique based on successive convex approximations, which can be solved in closed form. Finally, some simulation examples illustrate the performance and practical application of the proposed tests.	algorithm;approximation;convex optimization;estimation theory;existential quantification;gaussian blur;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;semiconductor industry;simulation;tucker decomposition	Javier Vía;Daniel Pérez Palomar;Luis Vielva	2011	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2010.2101067	entropy;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;likelihood-ratio test;signal processing;mathematics;statistics;quaternion	ML	52.2208222111446	12.988608609441888	105680
ee9a08f4b66e299f4b33c0243d835a97f7ca2978	fuzzy automata and life	fuzzy logic;cellular automata;game of life;rule entropy	1. Introduction Cellular Automata have generated much interest [1,2,3] because of their diverse behavior and usefulness as a discrete model for many processes. Wolfram's 1984 paper on universality and complexity in cellular automata [3,4] described four classes of behavior for automata: class 1 for homogeneous stable behavior, class 2 for simple periodic patterns, class 3 for chaotic aperiodic behavior and class 4 for complex behavior which generates local structures. Recent work by Cattaneo, Flocchini, Mauri, Quaranta Vogliotti, and Santoro [5] introduced an alternate classification scheme that can be obtained by generalizing Boolean cellular automata to a fuzzy automata and then observing the qualitative behavior of a Boolean window embedded in a fuzzy domain. These automata can be classified according to whether the Boolean behavior dominates, a mixture of Boolean and Fuzzy behavior appears, or purely fuzzy behavior appears. The fuzzy behavior can further be divided into subclasses with homogeneous and nonhomogeneous behavior. In this paper we further investigate these fuzzy extensions of one-dimensional automata and we also consider two-dimensional automata. We investigate the impact of using several choices for the fuzzy logic functions including the unusual logic used in [5]. The choice of different fuzzy logics lead to significantly different behaviors. We also introduce and use the one-dimensional continuous dynamics of the response functions to explain much of the qualitative behavior of these fuzzy automata. Lastly, we consider two-dimensional automata giving the Game of Life. We will see the greatest common divisor/least common multiple trivalent logic seems to be remarkably able to nurture the generation of Life without dominating it; the Game of Life appears even more complex in this context. The situation is somewhat analogous to a wave tank with expanding walls generating waves with the interference controlled by the rules of the Game of Life. The authors of [5] defined a quantity they call rule entropy in a simple manner based upon the defining Boolean rule. While of limited capacity compared to more classical measures of entropy [3,6], the simplicity of this entropy comes from the fact that it does not depend upon the configuration of states. They observed that this entropy was bounded between 0 and 6 for their automata and that class 3 (chaotic) behavior appeared to be limited to their fuzzy classes and associated with intermediate or high values of rule entropy, thus connecting the qualitative behaviors with this simple quantitative measure.

In this article, we provide the moments of the distributions of this family and we establish a continuous limiting behavior for the members I and II, in the sense of pointwise convergence, by applying a q-analogue of the usual Stirling asymptotic formula for the factorial number of order n. Specifically, we initially give the q-factorial moments and the usual moments for the family of confluent q-ChuVandermonde distributions and then we designate as a main theorem the conditions under which the confluent q-Chu-Vandermonde distributions I and II converge to a continuous Stieltjes-Wigert distribution. For the member III we give a continuous analogue. Moreover, as applications of this study we present a modified q-Bessel distribution, a generalized q-negative Binomial distribution and a generalized over/underdispersed (O/U) distribution. Note that in this article we prove the convergence of a family of discrete distributions to a continuous distribution which is not of a Gaussian type.	bessel filter;confluence (abstract rewriting);converge;markov chain;steady state	A.

5e2580ae09c179639a91745dca3c992bbfd1f415	statistical bounds for gaussian regression algorithms based on karhunen-loève expansions		We consider the problem of estimating functions in a Gaussian regression distributed and nonparametric framework where the unknown map is modeled as a Gaussian random field whose kernel encodes expected properties like smoothness. We assume that some agents with limited computational and communication capabilities collect M noisy function measurements on input locations independently drawn from a known probability density. Collaboration is then needed to obtain a common and shared estimate. When the number of measurements M is large, computing the minimum variance estimate in a distributed fashion is difficult since it requires first to exchange all the measurements and then to invert an M χ M matrix. A common approach is then to circumvent this problem by searching a suboptimal solution within a subspace spanned by a finite number of kernel eigenfunctions. In this paper we analyze this classical distributed estimator, and derive a rigorous probabilistic bound on its statistical performance that returns crucial information on the number of measurements and eigenfunctions needed to obtain the desired level of estimation accuracy.	algorithm;computer data storage;kernel (operating system);method (computer programming);numerical analysis	Gianluigi Pillonetto;Luca Schenato;Damiano Varagnolo	2017	2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2017.8263691	minimum-variance unbiased estimator;probability density function;kernel (linear algebra);mathematical optimization;estimator;gaussian random field;computer science;karhunen–loève theorem;nonparametric statistics;gaussian	ML	49.76318380599578	9.678133178714749	106193

In this paper, an analytical representation is developed to approximate the APDF of isotropic @a-stable clutter. In the approximation, the APDFs of Cauchy and Gaussian clutters are used as two linearly mixing components. In addition, four approaches are presented to compute the component weight.

Modeling the signal coefficients with a double Laplace mixture model, and assuming that the distribution of the components of the prior information differs slightly from the unknown signal, the problem is formulated as a weighted ℓ1 minimization problem. We derive sufficient conditions for perfect recovery and we show that our method is able to reduce significantly the number of measurements required for reconstruction. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the best algorithms for compressed sensing with prior information and is robust in imperfect scenarios.

We employ non-traditional methodology which merges distance and angle measurements, respectively withdrawn from the received signal strength (RSS) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) information. Based on RSS measurement model and effortless geometry, a novel non-convex estimator according to the weighted least squares (WLS) criterion is obtained, which closely approximates the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for small noise. It is shown that the devised estimator is appropriate for distributed implementation. Following the squared range (SR) approach, we propose a suboptimal SR-WLS estimator according to the generalized trust region sub-problem (GTRS) framework, to estimate the locations of all targets in the WSN. According to our simulations, the new estimator has excellent performance in a great variety of considered settings, in which the effectiveness of fusing two radio measurements is confirmed.	least squares	Marko Beko;Rui Dinis;Milan Tuba	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-31165-4_27	square (algebra);control engineering;wireless sensor network;estimator;signal strength;rss;mathematical optimization;trust region;maximum likelihood;engineering;least squares	Mobile	51.50155285479679	4.992927584534081	107702

Plug-in test statistics suffer from large estimation errors, often causing the performance to degrade as the measurement vector dimension increases. Choosing a better test statistic or applying a method of dimensionality reduction are two possible solutions to this problem. In this paper, we consider a recognition problem where the data for each population are assumed to have the same parametric distribution but differ in their unknown parameters. The collected vectors of data as well as their components are assumed to be independent. The system is designed to implement a plug-in log-likelihood ratio test with maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of the unknown parameters instead of the true parameters. Because a small amount of data is available to estimate the parameters, the performance of such a system is strongly degraded relative to the performance with known parameters. To improve the performance of the system we define a thresholding function that, when incorporated into the plug-in log-likelihood ratio, significantly decreases the probability of error for binary and multiple hypothesis testing problems for the exponential class of populations. We analyze the modified test statistic and present the results of Monte Carlo simulation. Special attention is paid to the complex Gaussian model with zero mean and unknown variances.	bitwise operation;dimensionality reduction;monte carlo method;plug-in (computing);population;simulation;thresholding (image processing);time complexity	Natalia A.

a35b1ccd231db100ae36781053654eed9a51a24a	sparsity-based estimation bounds with corrupted measurements		In typical Compressed Sensing operational contexts, the measurement vector y is often partially corrupted. The estimation of a sparse vector acting on the entire support set exhibits very poor estimation performance. It is crucial to estimate set Iuc containing the indexes of the uncorrupted measures. As Iuc and its cardinality |Iuc| < N are unknown, each sample of vector y follows an i.i.d. Bernoulli prior of probability Puc, leading to a Binomial-distributed cardinality. In this context, we derive and analyze the performance lower bound on the Bayesian Mean Square Error (BMSE) on a |S|-sparse vector where each random entry is the product of a continuous variable and a Bernoulli variable of probability P and |S| ∣∣∣|Iuc| follows a hierarchical Binomial distribution on set {1, . . . , |Iuc| − 1}. The derived lower bounds do not belong to the family of ”oracle” or ”genie-aided” bounds since our a priori knowledge on support Iuc and its cardinality is limited to probability Puc. In this context, very compact and simple expressions of the Expected Cramer-Rao Bound (ECRB) are proposed. Finally, the proposed lower bounds are compared to standard estimation strategies robust to an impulsive (sparse) noise.

11d8f14aa10abdff4b920d239f2abfde91fed370	a large class of chaotic sensing matrices for compressed sensing		Abstract Compressed sensing is a revolutionary sampling framework at a sub-Nyquist rate, which relies potentially on sensing matrix. In this paper, a large class of chaotic sensing matrices with low complexity, hardware-friendly implementation and desirable sampling efficiency is proposed based on topologically conjugate chaotic systems (TCcSs). Specifically, we first elaborate an independently and identically distributed chaotic stream, which is generated from a TCcS via our customized zone matching algorithm. Then, the chaotic stream is employed to construct the novel chaotic sensing matrix. Our framework encompasses various families of TCcSs for establishing sensing matrices, such as TCcSs of Tent chaotic system. Moreover, the mutual coherence of the proposed sensing matrices is investigated, and it shows that this kind of chaotic sensing matrices has similar sampling efficiency to that of the state-of-the-art sensing matrices. Experimental performances verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrate that the proposed matrices can provide comparable results against the existing ones.	compressed sensing	Hongping Gan;Song Xiao;Yimin Zhao	2018	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2018.03.014	compressed sensing;mathematical optimization;mutual coherence;correctness;sampling (statistics);topological conjugacy;blossom algorithm;independent and identically distributed random variables;matrix (mathematics);mathematics	Mobile	47.740358261811004	9.551471299317651	108557

Recently, [5], [11] proved (in a large dimensional and statistical context) that if the number of equations (measurements in the compressed sensing terminology) in the system is proportional to the length of the unknown vector then there is a sparsity (number of non-zero elements of the unknown vector) also proportional to the length of the unknown vector such that ℓ1-norm relaxation succeeds in solving the system. In this paper we consider a modification of this standard setup, namely the case of so-called approximately block-sparse unknown vectors [2], [27]. We determine sharp lower bounds on the values of allowable approximate block-sparsity for any given number (proportional to the length of the unknown vector) of equations. Obtained lower bounds on the allowable sparsity are as expected functions of a parameter used to describe how close the approximately block-sparse unknown vectors are to the ideally block-sparse ones.	approximation algorithm;compressed sensing;linear equation;linear programming relaxation;polynomial;sparse matrix;system of linear equations;taxicab geometry;while	Mihailo Stojnic	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2009.5205714	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;sparse matrix;signal processing;mathematics;linear equation;statistics	Theory	48.25019183253822	8.045991533683821	108571

We assume that the graph structure of such networks is known, and aim to find graph-theoretic conditions under which the state matrix of the network can be uniquely identified. As our main contribution, we present a graph coloring condition that ensures identifiability of the network’s state matrix. Additionally, we show how the framework can be used to assess identifiability of dynamical networks with general, higher-order node dynamics. As an interesting corollary of our results, we find that excitation and measurement of all network nodes is not required. In fact, for many network structures, identification is possible with only small fractions of measured and excited nodes.	apollonian network;dynamical system;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;graph theory	Henk J. van Waarde;Pietro Tesi;M.

Bayesian learning consists of estimating the distribution of the observed data conditional on each class from a set of training samples. Unfortunately, this estimation requires to evaluate intractable multidimensional integrals. This paper studies an original implementation of hierarchical Bayesian learning that estimates the class conditional probability densities using MCMC methods. The performance of this implementation is first studied via an academic example for which the class conditional densities are known. The problem of classifying chirp signals is then addressed by using a similar hierarchical Bayesian learning implementation based on a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm.	chirp;conditional entropy;gibbs algorithm;markov chain monte carlo;metropolis	Manuel Davy;Christian Doncarli;Jean-Yves Tourneret	2002	IEEE Trans.

In this paper, we demonstrate that such relations hold for a much larger family of continuous-time channels. We introduce the family of semi-martingale channels where the channel output is a semi-martingale stochastic process, and the channel input modulates the characteristics of the semi-martingale. For these channels, which includes as a special case the continuous time Gaussian and Poisson models, we establish new representations relating the mutual information between the channel input and output to an optimal causal filtering loss, thereby unifying and considerably extending results from the Gaussian and Poisson settings. Extensions to the setting of mismatched estimation are also presented where the relative entropy between the laws governing the output of the channel under two different input distributions is equal to the cumulative difference between the estimation loss incurred by using the mismatched and optimal causal filters, respectively. The main tool underlying these results is the Doob–Meyer decomposition of a class of sub-martingales. The results in this paper can be viewed as the continuous-time analogues of recent generalizations for relations between information and estimation for discrete-time Lévy channels.	causal filter;input/output;kullback–leibler divergence;mutual information;semiconductor industry;stochastic process	Jiantao Jiao;Kartik Venkat;Tsachy Weissman	2016	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541808	econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics	ML	50.748635203798955	14.865002133436496	110753

A simple, general, and powerful spectrum sensing technique based on the number of weighted zero-crossings in the observations is proposed. For the cases of uniform and exponential weights, an expression for computing the near-optimal detection threshold that meets a given false alarm probability constraint is obtained. The proposed detector is shown to be robust to two commonly encountered types of noise uncertainties, namely, the noise model uncertainty, where the PDF of the noise process is not completely known, and the noise parameter uncertainty, where the parameters associated with the noise PDF are either partially or completely unknown. Simulation results validate our analysis, and illustrate the performance benefits of the proposed technique relative to existing methods, especially in the low SNR regime and in the presence of noise uncertainties.	cognitive radio;computation;noise (electronics);noise shaping;portable document format;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;time complexity	Sanjeev Gurugopinath;Chandra Ramabhadra Murthy;Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula	2014	2014 Twentieth National Conference on Communications (NCC)	10.1109/NCC.2014.6811308	gradient noise;gaussian noise;econometrics;electronic engineering;value noise;noise temperature;noise measurement;quantum noise;noise;noise;mathematics;noise figure;noise floor;statistics	Robotics	51.03689425977904	11.653558122792482	110843

We tackle this problem by using linear shrinkage coefficients of signal and noise subspaces, ending up with two shrinkage coefficient-based detectors (SCDs) for source enumeration. It is proved that the noise shrinkage coefficients are asymptotically Gaussian distributed as the number of antennas and number of samples tend to infinity at the same rate. Moreover, the noise shrinkage coefficients almost surely converge to one while the signal shrinkage coefficients are almost surely less than one as m,n→,∞ and m/n→c.With these properties, the threshold-like and heuristic SCD algorithms for source number detection are devised.

PLBP performs two steps iteratively: linearization and belief propagation. At the linearization step, the nonlinear functions are linearized using statistical linear regression with respect to the current beliefs. This SLR is performed in practice by using sigma-points drawn from the beliefs. In the second step, belief propagation is run on the linearized model.

The results reveal an interesting dichotomy, with crucially different behavior for α > 1 and α < 1, respectively.

At each instance, two nodes are selected to meet with a given probability. When nodes meet, two unreliable communication links are established with communication in each direction succeeding with a time-varying probability. It is shown that two particularly interesting cases arise when these communication processes are either perfectly dependent or independent. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the success probability sequence are proposed to ensure almost sure consensus or ε-consensus. Weak connectivity is required when the communication is perfectly dependent, while double connectivity is required when the communication is independent. Moreover, it is proven that with odd number of nodes, average preserving turns from almost forever (with probability one for all initial conditions) for perfectly dependent communication, to almost never (with probability zero for almost all initial conditions) for the independent case. This average preserving property does not hold true for general number of nodes. These results indicate the fundamental role the node interactions have in randomized gossip algorithms.	bernoulli polynomials;consensus (computer science);distributed algorithm;information flow (information theory);initial condition;interaction;randomized algorithm;stochastic matrix	Guodong Shi;Mikael Johansson;Karl Henrik Johansson	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6426729	distributed algorithm;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;probability;mathematics;distributed computing;statistics	Theory	46.33754713980342	9.699308934846806	111728
4e82933da8417237d8737bcd4939512ebfa8c163	equivalence and orthogonality of gaussian measures on spheres		Abstract The equivalence of Gaussian measures is a fundamental tool to establish the asymptotic properties of both prediction and estimation of Gaussian fields under fixed domain asymptotics. The paper solves Problem 18 in the list of open problems proposed by Gneiting (2013). Specifically, necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the equivalence of Gaussian measures associated to random fields defined on the d -dimensional sphere S d , and with covariance functions depending on the great circle distance. We also focus on a comparison of our result with existing results on the equivalence of Gaussian measures for isotropic Gaussian fields on R d + 1 restricted to the sphere S d . For such a case, the covariance function depends on the chordal distance being an approximation of the true distance between two points located on the sphere. Finally, we provide equivalence conditions for some parametric families of covariance functions depending on the great circle distance. An important implication of our results is that all the parameters indexing some families of covariance functions on spheres can be consistently estimated. A simulation study illustrates our findings in terms of implications on the consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator under fixed domain asymptotics.	turing completeness	Ahmed Arafat;Emilio Porcu;Moreno Bevilacqua;Jorge Mateu	2018	J.

It is shown that the cumulant and moment based trispectra are identical except on certain planes in trifrequency space. If these planes are avoided, their principal domains can be derived by considering the regions of symmetry of the fourth order spectral moment. The fourth order averaged periodogram will then serve as an estimate for both cumulant and moment trispectra. Statistics of estimates of normalised trispectra or tricoherence are also discussed. The auto-trispectrum, Cxxxx(f1; f2; f3), of a stationary and ergodic (at least to the fourth order) random process, x(t), is usually deened 1] as the Fourier transform of its fourth cumulant, cxxxx(1; 2; 3). (1) cxxxx(1; 2; 3) = C x(t)x(t + 1)x(t + 2)x(t + 3)] (2) where F represents Fourier transformation, C represents the cumulant operation on random variables, f's and 's represent frequencies and lags, respectively. The cumulant based trispectrum is guaranteed to exist provided the cu-mulant function decreases with increasing lag and belongs to the class L1 of absolutely integrable functions. This is a suucient but not necessary condition for the existence of the Fourier transform of the cumulant function. Alternatively , a moment based auto-trispectrum, Mxxxx(f1; f2; f3), can be deened as the Fourier transform of the fourth order (3) mxxxx(1; 2; 3) = E x(t)x(t + 1)x(t + 2)x(t + 3)] (4) where E represents the expectation operation.

As pointed out by Robins [2, 1], Verma and Pearl [6], and Tian and Pearl [5], marginals of DAG models also imply equality constraints that are not conditional independences. The well-known ‘Verma constraint’ is an example. Constraints of this type were used for testing edges [3], and an efficient variable elimination scheme [4]. Using acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) we provide a graphical characterization of the constraints given in [5] via a nested Markov property that uses a ‘fixing’ transformation on graphs. We give four characterizations of our nested model that are analogous to those given for DAGs. We show that marginal distributions of DAG models obey this property.	directed acyclic graph;marginal model;markov chain;markov property;mixed graph;variable elimination;whole earth 'lectronic link	Thomas S.

The codewords are corrupted by small levels of roundoff noise and possibly occasionally by a few large excursions of random disturbances. The error-correcting procedure is separated into two parts, large activity detection followed by error value estimation, particularly the larger errors. The first part determines if large excursions are present, roughly identifying their locations, while the second part is a Wiener minimum mean-squared error estimation technique providing a stochastic correction to the corrupted components. The activity-detecting part determines locations for large increases in the Wiener estimator's gain. A computationally intensive Bayes hypothesis testing approach is shown to be very effective at locating large activity positions, but a more efficient modified Berlekamp-Massey (1969) algorithm is developed which leads to excellent mean-squared error performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate individual codeword corrective actions and compare the average mean-squared error performance between coded and unprotected data. The error level improvement ranges from three to four orders of magnitude.	code	G. Robert Redinbo	2000	IEEE Trans.

We introduce the notion of expected pair-wise comparison of a fuzzy random variable. It inludes some well-known parameters such as the quadratic entropy of a random variable, the upper probability induced by a random set or the scalar variance of a fuzzy random variable as particular cases. The special case of expected dissimilitude is highlighted and shown as a useful alternative to the scalar variance when the images of the fuzzy random variable are not necessarily convex, nor in a numerical scale.	differential entropy;numerical analysis	Inés Couso;Laura Garrido;Susana Montes;Luciano Sánchez	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14746-3_14	multivariate random variable;algebraic formula for the variance	AI	45.23288736796433	14.883924811540284	112874

The asymptotic fluctuations, as the matrix size grows large, are shown to be intimately linked with matrices from the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). When the spiked population eigenvalues have unit multiplicity, the fluctuations follow a central limit theorem. This result is used to develop an original framework for the detection and diagnosis of local failures in large sensor networks, for known or unknown failure magnitude. Simulations are carried out that show the strong performance of the derived failure localization algorithms.

The multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials are symmetric functions of orthogonal sets of functions defined on each of N multinomial trials. The dual multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials, which also have a polynomial structure, are seen to occur naturally as spectral orthogonal polynomials in a Karlin and McGregor spectral representation of transition functions in a composition birth and death process. In this Markov composition process in continuous time there are N independent and identically distributed birth and death processes each with support 0, 1, . . .. The state space in the composition process is the number of processes in the different states 0, 1, . . ..

Since the precision (< some mm) and accuracy (< 1 cm) requirements are very high, sophisticated correction models and analysis strategies were developed, e.g. like the network RTK concept realised in different active permanent reference station networks. However, multipath and signal diffraction as well as the incomplete stochastic model for GNSS observations limits still the attainable accuracy and precision, especially for real time applications. In this paper, we focus on multipath and diffraction mitigation. The state of the art procedures for mitigation are revisited as well as the challenges for new strategies are addressed and explained using examples from the Satellite Positioning Service of the German National Survey (SAPOS) and from typical geodetic monitoring networks. Finally the importance of a complete stochastic model for GPS observations for statistically tests and meaningful interpretations of the results is underlined.	geodetic datum;global positioning system;multipath propagation;near field communication;observable;real time kinematic;requirement;satellite navigation;stochastic process	Steffen Schön;Florian Dilßner	2007	2007 4th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication	10.1109/WPNC.2007.353639	stochastic process;statistical hypothesis testing;geodesy;telecommunications;mathematics;statistics;remote sensing	Robotics	49.676259185373546	18.073203663322676	112977

Through detailed state vector simulations of an appropriate quantum circuit, we show that the error locations within the circuit itself heavily influences the probability of success of the QPF subroutine.

Finally, we derive and implement a novel “ε-perfect sampling” algorithm for the limiting marginal distribution as time goes to infinity. In this case the importance is a proof of concept that has the potential to be expanded to more interesting (DSMC) direct simulation Monte Carlo applications.	algorithm;dijkstra's algorithm;direct simulation monte carlo;marginal model;monte carlo method;sampling (signal processing);tails;velocity (software development)	Jem N.

90a981b79d409cc7bacf63005951f01418526c0c	commutative cellular automata		Totalistic cellular automata were introduced by Wolfram [1, 2] as a means of studying higher-color cellular automata within a reasonable space of possible rules. The underlying principle is to systematically construct a subset of rules within all the possible rules of the highercolor cellular automata, and the system in totalistic cellular automata is to add up the values of the cells within the neighborhood and determine the next cell from this sum. In this paper, we generalize this idea of taking a subset of the possible rules in cellular automata by partitioning all possible neighborhoods into neighborhood equivalence classes and use this tool to analyze cellular automata containing totalistic cellular automata— commutative cellular automata. Commutative cellular automata have the property that the state of the determined cell is unaffected by the ordering of the cells in its neighborhood (some of these cellular automata meet the criteria of quasi-linear cellular automata, and so their evolutions can be computed more efficiently than the standard cellular automaton algorithm�[3]). The Game of Life is a case of outer-commutative cellular automata, where the state of the determined cell is unaffected by the noncenter cells. Using the concept of neighborhood equivalence classes, it can be shown that certain commutative cellular automata—totalistic and multiplistic—can emulate each other as well as the space of all commutative cellular automata. The space of all one-dimensional commutative cellular automata will be enumerated by using g==Sort[{##}]& as the transition function, and certain variations of commutative cellu-	algorithm;cellular automaton;conway's game of life;turing completeness	Victor Duy Phan	2016	Complex Systems		mathematics;discrete mathematics;cellular automaton;commutative property	Theory	39.210066843730644	8.997750977243783	113838

In a first part we consider problems of optimal stopping under drift ambiguity for one-dimensional diffusion processes. Analogously to the case of ordinary optimal stopping problems for one-dimensional Brownian motions we reduce the problem to the geometric problem of finding the smallest majorant of the reward function in a two-parameter function space. In a second part we solve optimal stopping problems when the underlying process may crash down. These problems are reduced to one optimal stopping problem and one Dynkin game.

To overcome this difficulty, suboptimal approximations have been studied in the past. One of the simplest approaches is to expand the likelihood ratio and truncate this expansion under the weak signal assumption. In this paper, we first study the relations between the Taylor expansion and the Volterra expansion. Under a weak signal assumption, we emphasize the links between the Taylor expansion with respect to the SNR and the detection criteria on one hand, and with robustness on the other. In particular, using two criteria derived from deflection, we show that the minimax robust filter is the matched filter. Finally, an application to underwater signal detection is studied, showing that the degradation resulting from the use of the locally optimal receiver is small.		Michel Bouvet	1986	IEEE Trans.

It allows for a detailed description of the model uncertainty and the non-predictable stochastic law of natural systems, e.g. in ecosystems even the probability law of the random dynamic changes due to unobservable influences like anthropogenic disturbances or climate variation. The fuzziness of the stochastic system is modelled by a fuzzy set of stochastic differential equations which is identified with a fuzzy set of initial conditions, timedependent drift and diffusion functions. Using appropriate function spaces the extension principle leads to a consistent theory providing fuzzy solutions in terms of fuzzy sets of processes, fuzzy states, fuzzy moments and fuzzy probabilites.	ecosystem;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;initial condition;stochastic process	Björn Sprungk;K.

45f6c947a9b87b617673f3d0ab5d24e5a9b0a557	quantum algorithms for gibbs sampling and hitting-time estimation		We present quantum algorithms for solving two problems regarding stochastic processes. The first algorithm prepares the thermal Gibbs state of a quantum system and runs in time almost linear in $\sqrt{N \beta/{\cal Z}}$ and polynomial in $\log(1/\epsilon)$, where $N$ is the Hilbert space dimension, $\beta$ is the inverse temperature, ${\cal Z}$ is the partition function, and $\epsilon$ is the desired precision of the output state. Our quantum algorithm exponentially improves the dependence on $1/\epsilon$ and quadratically improves the dependence on $\beta$ of known quantum algorithms for this problem. The second algorithm estimates the hitting time of a Markov chain. For a sparse stochastic matrix $P$, it runs in time almost linear in $1/(\epsilon \Delta^{3/2})$, where $\epsilon$ is the absolute precision in the estimation and $\Delta$ is a parameter determined by $P$, and whose inverse is an upper bound of the hitting time. Our quantum algorithm quadratically improves the dependence on $1/\epsilon$ and $1/\Delta$ of the analog classical algorithm for hitting-time estimation.

SPICE is a robust, user parameter-free, high-resolution, iterative and globally convergent estimation algorithm for array processing. SPICE offers superior resolution and lower sidelobe levels for source localization at the cost of a higher computational complexity compared to the conventional delay-and-sum beamforming method. It is shown in this paper that the computational complexity of the SPICE algorithm can be reduced by exploiting the Toeplitz structure of the array output covariance matrix using the Gohberg-Semencul factorization. The fast implementations for both the hydrophone uniform linear array (ULA) and the vector-sensor ULA scenarios are proposed and the computational gains are illustrated by numerical simulations.	array processing;beamforming;computation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;image resolution;iterative method;numerical analysis;sonar (symantec);spice;sparse matrix;toeplitz hash algorithm	Qilin Zhang;Habti Abeida;Ming Xue;William Rowe	2011	2011 Conference Record of the Forty Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (ASILOMAR)	10.1109/ACSSC.2011.6190383	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;theoretical computer science;mathematics	HPC	53.57705583022124	7.352216060097483	114960

This was proved in 1977 by Kingman and by Vershik and Schmidt. For soft reasons, this is equivalent to the statement that the random permutations and the Poisson–Dirichlet process can be coupled so that zero is the limit of the expected 1 distance between the process of cycle length proportions and the Poisson–Dirichlet process. We investigate how rapid this metric convergence can be, and in doing so, give two new proofs of the distributional convergence. One of the couplings we consider has an analogue for the prime factorizations of a uniformly distributed random integer, and these couplings rely on the ‘scale-invariant spacing lemma’ for the scale-invariant Poisson processes, proved in this paper.	approximation;random permutation;schmidt decomposition	Richard Arratia;Andrew D.

Classical TDOA-based emitter location methods assume only a single emitter is being estimated. As a result, when multiple emitters that cannot be resolved during detection exist, the MSE performance is significantly degraded. These errors are due to the fact that the TDOA observation model does not account for multiple transmissions. We propose a new TDOA observation model that can resolve multiple emitted signals. We show a significant improvement in MSE when locating multiple emitters using our new model as compared with the classical one-emitter assumption TDOA model.	coherence (physics);cross-correlation;lambert's cosine law;multilateration;non-linear least squares;separation logic;simulation	Jack F.

Automatic gain control in pulse amplitude modulation systems und the reference carrier in coherent demodulation systems provide the noise-free signal values for the set of symbols at the receiver. This reduces the problem of channel and data statistics estimation to the estimation of the common component variance and mixing probabilities in a finite Gaussian mixture, with known values for component means. Using these known component means, /spl mu//sub 1/...../spl mu//sub M/, a set of non-linear transformations, sinh(/spl mu//sub i/x) and cosh(/spl mu//sub i/x) of the data (mixture random variable X) are used to develop convergent and computationally efficient estimators for both the noise variance and the vector of symbol probabilities. The estimation equations can be implemented recursively or with a batch processing algorithm. Asymptotic variances of the estimates are derived and the developed estimator is simulated for a specific problem.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;automatic gain control;batch processing;carrier recovery;coherence (physics);emoticon;modulation;nonlinear system;recursion	Larry N.

Then, a closed-form two-stage solution is proposed based on estimation of the range nuisance parameter in the first stage and refinement of initial solution in the next stage. The proposed solution is shown analytically and verified by simulations to be an efficient estimate, which can attain the CRLB performance under mild Gaussian noise assumption. This method is able to locate the source with the minimum number of sensors required for  $N$ -dimensional localization. Numerical simulations demonstrate significant performance improvement of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms and corroborate the theoretical developments.

c5c71a10c04818903d6257526693f49652c997f7	rank properties for matrices constructed from time differences of arrival		Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) positioning has been an active research over the years due to its rich amounts of applications. Improving the quality of the TDOA measurements, especially under harsh scenarios, is crucial to achieve better localization accuracy and higher noise tolerance. Increasing the TDOA quality has been traditionally based on the statistical estimation point of view. Nevertheless, TDOA exhibits interesting algebraic properties, which when exploited can further enhance the measurements. This paper develops two algebraic properties of TDOA in the situation where multiple sources and sensors are present, such as sensor network and joint source-sensor localizations. The algebraic properties are new and have not appeared in the literature. They are in terms of the rank behaviors of two matrices that are formed by the TDOA themselves and their squared values. The development starts from an established property of Time of Arrival and applies determinant and vector space manipulations to obtain the concrete results. An example is included to illustrate the use of the algebraic properties for reducing the noise in TDOAs.	estimation theory;internationalization and localization;linear algebra;multilateration;sensor;time of arrival	T.

The approximations can be interpreted as finite difference schemes for the generator of the process. We derive conditions on the diffusion coefficients which permit transition probabilities to match locally first and second moments. We derive a novel formula which expresses how the matching becomes more difficult for larger (absolute) correlations and strongly anisotropic processes, such that instantaneous moves to more distant neighbours on the lattice have to be allowed. Roughly speaking, for non-zero correlations, the distance covered in one timestep is proportional to the ratio of volatilities in the two directions. We discuss the implications to Markov decision processes and the convergence analysis of approximations to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations in the Barles-Souganidis framework.	approximation;locality of reference;markov chain	Christoph Reisinger	2018	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/j.matcom.2016.06.001	markov chain;mathematical optimization;markov kernel;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	43.707815291349	12.275572878378023	116066
f3581f53240a271b8b500cf4e197ca3ada3a7204	a theorem about the algorithm of minimization of differences for multicomponent cellular automata		Multicomponent Cellular Automata, also known as Macroscopic Cellular Automata, characterize a methodological approach for modeling complex systems, that need many components both for the states (substates) to account for different properties of the cell and for the transition function (elementary processes) in order to account for various different dynamics. Many applications were developed for modeling complex natural phenomena, particularly macroscopic ones, e.g., large scale surface flows. Minimizing the differences of a certain quantity in the cell neighborhood, by distribution from the cell to the other neighboring cells, is a basic component of many transition functions in this context. The Algorithm for the Minimization of Differences (AMD) was applied in different ways to many models. A fundamental theorem about AMD is proved in this paper; it shows that AMD properties are more extended than the previous demonstrated theorem.	algorithm;cellular automaton	Maria Vittoria Avolio;Salvatore Di Gregorio;William Spataro;Giuseppe A.

Let Zn be the proportion of black balls at time n and 0 ≤ L < U ≤ 1 random barriers. At each time n, a ball bn is drawn. If bn is black and Zn−1 < U , then bn is replaced together with a random number Bn of black balls. If bn is red and Zn−1 > L, then bn is replaced together with a random number Rn of red balls. Otherwise, no additional balls are added, and bn alone is replaced. In this paper, we assume Rn = Bn. Then, under mild conditions, it is shown that Zn a.s. −→ Z for some random variable Z, and Dn := √ n (Zn − Z) −→ N (0, σ) conditionally a.s. where σ is a certain random variance. Almost sure conditional convergence means that P ( Dn ∈ · | Gn ) weakly −→ N (0, σ) a.s. where P ( Dn ∈ · | Gn ) is a regular version of the conditional distribution of Dn given the past Gn. Thus, in particular, one obtains Dn −→ N (0, σ) stably. It is also shown that L < Z < U a.s. and Z has non-atomic distribution.	random number generation;randomness	Patrizia Berti;Irene Crimaldi;Luca Pratelli;Pietro Rigo	2016	J.

In this scheme, a reference beacon initiates the localisation by emitting a ranging signal, and the sensor position is estimated by measuring the length of the signal propagation path from the reference beacon to every beacon via the sensor. The associated Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is derived, and a localisation algorithm, which does not need a priori knowledge about the TOA estimation accuracy, is proposed based on the constrained least square (LS) principle. It is illustrated by numerical experiments that the proposed scheme features a lower CRB compared to the conventional time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)-based scheme, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is close to the CRB, especially when the sensor is in the centre area surrounded by the beacons. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

71f4153ff602bc3c1c030ea30e4a3c37a576c1a2	stokes parameters and 2-d doas estimation of polarized sources with an l-shaped coprime array		Abstract In this paper, a sparse reconstruction based approach to estimate Stokes parameters and 2-D DOAs of polarized sources is proposed in case of unknown number of sources. An L-shaped coprime array composed of dipole-dipole pairs, where a dipole in the dipole-dipole pair is placed on x-axis and the other is placed on z-axis, is used to reduce the mutual coupling across two dipoles in the dipole-dipole pair. In order to estimate the elevation of polarized sources, an orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm with the identification of the sourcesu0027 number (OMP-isn) is proposed. In our proposed approach, the quasi deterministic maximum likelihood (qDML) test step is added in each iteration of algorithm. In addition, a refining grid step is also added in each iteration to reduce the estimation error incurred by the grid mismatch. The OMP algorithm and sparse iterative covariance-based estimation (SPICE) method are employed to estimate the azimuth of polarized sources. In order to pari the azimuth with the elevation, a pair-matching method is proposed based on the l 2 -norm and l 1 -norm ( l 2 / l 1 ) minimization. Based on the pairing azimuth and elevation, Stokes parameters of polarized sources are estimated by using Least Squares (LS) or Total Least Squares (TLS). The stochastic CRB is derived for the 2-D DOAs and Stokes parameters of polarized sources. Simulations are used to verify the performance of the proposed approach.	stokes parameters	Wen-xiu Chang;Xin-bo Li	2018	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2018.02.016	stokes parameters;elevation;mathematical optimization;azimuth;mathematics;grid;matching pursuit;total least squares;least squares;covariance	EDA	52.89568963172685	7.797784196421001	117200

To derive our adaptive LR-STAP filters, the estimation of the projector onto the clutter subspace is performed from the Sample Covariance Matrix (SCM) and the Normalized Sample Covariance Matrix (NSCM). We compute the theoretical performance of both corresponding LR-STAP filters through the analysis of the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) Loss, based on a perturbation analysis. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical formula and allow to show that the LR-STAP filter built from the SCM performance does not depend on the heterogeneity of the SIRV clutter whereas the LR-STAP filter built from the NSCM performance does.	adaptive filter;clutter;glr parser;interference (communication);lr parser;low-rank approximation;numerical linear algebra;perturbation theory;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;space-time adaptive processing;video projector	Guillaume Ginolhac;Philippe Forster;Frédéric Pascal;Jean Philippe Ovarlez	2013	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2012.2226162	adaptive filter;gaussian noise;covariance matrix;speech recognition;numerical analysis;space-time adaptive processing;computer science;mathematics;clutter;signal-to-noise ratio;radar;statistics	ML	51.48652697067757	9.799677546762283	117314

Unlike existing detectors assuming a known hyperparameter associated with R, a knowledge-aided detector with the capability of automatic weighting is considered by accounting for the uncertainty of the prior knowledge. Specifically, the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is utilized to develop the test statistic, along with the maximum marginal likelihood (MML) estimation of the hyperparameter. The proposed KA-MML-GLRT detector is evaluated by numerical simulations and the results show improved detection performance over conventional and knowledge-aided detectors, especially in the case of limited training signals and inaccurate prior knowledge.	computer simulation;detection theory;marginal model;numerical analysis;sensor	Pu Wang;Hongbin Li;Olivier Besson;Jun Fang	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472208	estimation of covariance matrices;econometrics;likelihood principle;score test;likelihood-ratio test;marginal likelihood;pattern recognition;mathematics;restricted maximum likelihood;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;statistics	Robotics	51.03477556031353	10.025817206895569	117317

It is based on two successive biorthogonal decompositions aiming at representing spatio-temporal stochastic fields. The proposed double expansion allows to build the model even in the case of large-size problems by separating the time, space and random parts of the field. A Gaussian kernel estimator is used to simulate the high dimensional set of random variables appearing in the decomposition. The capability of the method to reproduce the non-stationary and non-Gaussian features of random phenomena is illustrated by applications to earthquakes (seismic ground motion) and sea states (wave heights).	simulation;stationary process	Irmela Zentner;Gregoire Ferré;Fabrice Poirion;M.

The focus is the behavior of the so-called ldquoplug-inrdquo estimator, which is simply the rate-distortion function of the empirical distribution of the observed data. Sufficient conditions are given for its consistency, and examples are provided demonstrating that in certain cases it fails to converge to the true rate-distortion function. The analysis of its performance is complicated by the fact that the rate-distortion function is not continuous in the source distribution; the underlying mathematical problem is closely related to the classical problem of establishing the consistency of maximum-likelihood estimators (MLEs). General consistency results are given for the plug-in estimator applied to a broad class of sources, including all stationary and ergodic ones. A more general class of estimation problems is also considered, arising in the context of lossy data compression when the allowed class of coding distributions is restricted; analogous results are developed for the plug-in estimator in that case. Finally, consistency theorems are formulated for modified (e.g., penalized) versions of the plug-in, and for estimating the optimal reproduction distribution.	converge;data compression;distortion;ergodicity;lossy compression;plug-in (computing);rate–distortion theory;stationary process	Matthew T.

This quantity arises in a large deviations analysis of a Markov chain on the set of types - the Wright-Fisher model of neutral genetic drift: a population with allele distribution q produces offspring with allele distribution w, which then produce offspring with allele distribution p, and so on. The chained divergences enjoy some of the same properties as the K-L divergence (like joint convexity in the arguments) and appear in k-step versions of some of the same settings as the K-L divergence (like information projections and a conditional limit theorem). We further characterize the optimal k-step """"path"""" of distributions appearing in the definition and apply our findings in a large deviations analysis of the Wright-Fisher process. We make a connection to information geometry via the previously studied continuum limit, where the number of steps tends to infinity, and the limiting path is a geodesic in the Fisher information metric. Finally, we offer a thermodynamic interpretation of the chained divergence (as the rate of operation of an appropriately defined Maxwell's demon) and we state some natural extensions and applications (a k-step mutual information and k-step maximum likelihood inference).

Such models break down at low concentrations, where stochastic effects become dominant. Instead, one has to solve the master equation that governs the multidimensional probability distribution of particle populations. For large networks such an approach is often computationally prohibitive due to the exponential dependence of the number of states on the number of components. The multiplane method is a dimension reduction technique that exploits the structure of the network to derive approximate dynamics for the marginal distributions of pairs of coreacting species. This method was introduced in [A. Lipshtat and O. Biham, Phys. Rev. Lett., 93 (2004), 170601] as an uncontrolled approximation for specific examples in the context of interstellar chemical reactions. In this paper we formalize the method and prove that it is asymptotically exact in the two extreme limits of small and large population sizes. Our analysis concentrates on steady-state conditions, although numerical simulations indicate that the method is equally well applicable to time-dependent solutions. This analysis partially explains the surprisingly high accuracy of the method.	approximation algorithm;chemical reaction network theory;computer simulation;dimensionality reduction;marginal model;numerical analysis;pictbridge;population;steady state;stochastic process;time complexity;uncontrolled format string	Baruch Barzel;Ofer Biham;Raz Kupferman	2007	Multiscale Modeling & Simulation	10.1137/070685245	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;calculus;stochastic simulation;mathematics;master equation;statistics;dimensionality reduction;asymptotic expansion	ML	42.89089869629466	9.028331929508141	117782

In particular, both J (n, 1), the complete graph Kn, and J (n, 2), the strongly regular triangular graph Tn, support fast quantum spatial search. Wong showed that continuous-time quantum walk search on J (n, 3) also supports fast search. The problem is reconsidered in the language of scattering quantum walk, a type of discrete-time quantum walk. Here the search space is confined to a low-dimensional subspace corresponding to the collapsed graph. Using matrix perturbation theory, we show that discrete-time quantum walk search on J (n, 3) also achieves full quantum speedup. The analytical method can also be applied to general Johnson graphs J (n, k) with fixed k.

In addition, many works are based on the assumption of a white noise model. These two assumptions are increasingly less realistic in modern systems where N and T are usually both large, and where the noise data can be correlated either across successive observations or across the sensor antennas. In this paper an approach to handle this kind of scenario is presented. New algorithms for source number estimation, power estimation, and localization by a sensor array under noise with unknown correlation model are proposed. The results fundamentally rely on recent advances in small rank perturbations of large dimensional random matrices.	algorithm;array processing;sensor;white noise	Julia Vinogradova;Romain Couillet;Walid Hachem	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638398	gaussian noise;wireless sensor network;computer science;noise measurement;machine learning;antenna;multiplicative noise;mathematics;white noise;sensor array;statistics;detection theory	Robotics	51.20253279996388	5.934173862685616	118122

The obtained estimate generalizes the fixed point estimate to scaled packets of data, and is hence called the generalized fixed point estimate (GFPE). The statistical properties (bias, consistency, and asymptotical distributions) of the estimate are presented, and verified through simulations. As an example of application, a radar detection problem is considered. The GFPE is used in the well-known adaptive normalized matched filter (ANMF), and the obtained empirical probability of false alarms threshold curve is compared to the theoretical one. The ANMF is also used to compare the GFPE to the fixed point estimate.	asymptote;exponent bias;fixed point (mathematics);matched filter;radar;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Abigael Taylor;Philippe Forster;Franck Daout;Hélène M.

39e9cb9d9e6e877907725bb1f5ed03c111a5e089	passive source localization using importance sampling based on toa and foa measurements		Passive source localization via a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator can achieve a high accuracy but involves high calculation burdens, especially when based on time-of-arrival and frequency-of-arrival measurements for its internal nonlinearity and nonconvex nature. In this paper, we use the Pincus theorem and Monte Carlo importance sampling (MCIS) to achieve an approximate global solution to the ML problem in a computationally efficient manner. The main contribution is that we construct a probability density function (PDF) of Gaussian distribution, which is called an important function for efficient sampling, to approximate the ML estimation related to complicated distributions. The improved performance of the proposed method is attributed to the optimal selection of the important function and also the guaranteed convergence to a global maximum. This process greatly reduces the amount of calculation, but an initial solution estimation is required resulting from Taylor series expansion. However, the MCIS method is robust to this prior knowledge for point sampling and correction of importance weights. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve the Cramér-Rao lower bound at a moderate Gaussian noise level and outperforms the existing methods.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;computation;global optimization;importance sampling;maxima and minima;monte carlo integration;monte carlo method;nearest-neighbor interpolation;noise (electronics);nonlinear system;portable document format;sampling (signal processing);sensor;series expansion;simulation;time of arrival	Rui-rui Liu;Yunlong Wang;Jie-xin Yin;Ding Wang;Ying Wu	2017	Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering	10.1631/FITEE.1601657	estimator;mathematical optimization;probability density function;statistics;importance sampling;gaussian noise;sampling (statistics);monte carlo method;taylor series;mathematics;upper and lower bounds	ML	52.32430245966429	4.930311152316628	118559

While a diversity gain from joint sparsity had been demonstrated earlier in the case of a convex relaxation method using an l1/ l2 mixed norm penalty, only recently was it shown that similar diversity gain can be achieved by greedy algorithms if we combine greedy steps with a MUSIC-like subspace criterion. However, the main limitation of these hybrid algorithms is that they often require a large number of snapshots or a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for an accurate subspace as well as partial support estimation. One of the main contributions of this work is to show that the noise robustness of these algorithms can be significantly improved by allowing sequential subspace estimation and support filtering, even when the number of snapshots is insufficient. Numerical simulations show that a novel sequential compressive MUSIC (sequential CS-MUSIC) that combines the sequential subspace estimation and support filtering steps significantly outperforms the existing greedy algorithms and is quite comparable with computationally expensive state-of-art algorithms.	analysis of algorithms;compressed sensing;greedy algorithm;linear programming relaxation;multiuse model view;numerical linear algebra;relaxation (iterative method);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sparse matrix	Jongmin Kim;Ok Kyun Lee;Jong Chul Ye	2012	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2012.2211591	mathematical optimization;greedy algorithm;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	Vision	50.122570466766994	7.023221403731196	118608

Designs that are insensitive to uncertainty in the rate functions are developed by applying a minimax formulation to two different measures of signal-to-noise ratio. Uncertainty in the rate is modeled by using general classes of rate measures generated by Choquet Zaltemating capacities, and solutions are characterized for this case by a Radon-Nikodym type derivative between such classes. It is shown that for uncertainty within capacity classes the robust decision design developed for the signal-to-noise ratio is also robust in a weaker sense for the Chemoff upper bounds on the error probabilities. Furthermore, the use of such a test guarantees the exponential convergence of these bounds to zero with increasing length of the observation interval for all rates in the uncertainty class.	graph (discrete mathematics);minimax;point process;radon–nikodym theorem;signal-to-noise ratio;strassen algorithm;time complexity	Evaggelos Geraniotis;H.

Although the DDR is less complex to instrument than other adaptive schemes, inherent in the decision-directed approach is the possibility of a runaway. This occurs when the detector commits a sequence of decision errors resulting in a degradation of parameter estimates, which, in turn, results in a further deterioration of detector performance. Because of the dependencies introduced by the learning process, runaway is difficult to analyze. In this paper, a DDR with unknown a priori probabilities is considered. The priors are estimated by the relative frequency of decisions of that event. For binary detection, it is shown that there is a positive probability of a runaway (the estimates converge to 1 or 0), which equals 1 if the signal-to-noise ratio is below a critical value. A tight bound on the probability of a runaway is obtained by approximating the learning process by a random walk with independent increments. The analysis demonstrates that a runaway is quite improbable even for moderate signal-to-noise ratios. The analysis is extended to multiple signals and to the situation where the estimates of the priors are updated continuously through exponential weighting rather than allowed to converge.		Lee D.

f30dc1aded3932aa6d150fece101c2d6dbd44f82	mean and median of psd matrices on a riemannian manifold: application to detection of narrow-band sonar signals		The rich information in the power spectral density (PSD) matrix of a received signal can be extracted in different ways for various purposes in signal processing. Care, however, must be taken when distances between PSD matrices are considered because these matrices form a Riemannian manifold in the signal space. In this paper, two Riemannian distances (RD) are introduced for the measurement of distances between PSD matrices on the manifold. The principle by which the geodesics on the manifold can be lifted to a Euclidean subspace isometric with the tangent space of the manifold is also explained and emphasized. This leads to the concept that any optimization involving the RD on the manifold can be equivalently performed in this Euclidean subspace. The application of this principle is illustrated by the development of iterative algorithms to find the Riemannian means and Riemannian medians according to the two RD. These distance measures are then applied to the detection of narrow-band sonar signals. Exploration of the translation of measure reference as well as the application of optimum weighting show substantial improvement in detection performance over classical detection method.	algorithm;isometric projection;iterative method;mathematical optimization;ruby document format;sonar (symantec);signal processing;spectral density	Kon Max Wong;Jian-Kang Zhang;Jiaping Liang;Huiying Jiang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2017.2760288	mathematical optimization;manifold;tangent space;riemannian manifold;pseudo-riemannian manifold;geodesic;statistical manifold;information geometry;mathematics;topology;exponential map (riemannian geometry)	Vision	51.656604801877826	14.777766369602652	119060

c68e2fc4a586a05401e4cbd5a921a3eadebcbda2	enhancing sensitivity in quantum metrology by hamiltonian extensions		A well-studied scenario in quantum parameter estimation theory arises when the parameter to be estimated is imprinted on the initial state by a Hamiltonian of the form θG. For such “phase shift Hamiltonians” it has been shown that one cannot improve the channel quantum Fisher information by adding ancillas and letting the system interact with them. Here we investigate the general case, where the Hamiltonian is not necessarily a phase shift, and show that in this case in general it is possible to increase the quantum channel information and to reach an upper bound. This can be done by adding a term proportional to the derivative of the Hamiltonian, or by subtracting a term to the original Hamiltonian. Neither method makes use of any ancillas which shows that for quantum channel estimation with arbitrary parameter-dependent Hamiltonian, entanglement with an ancillary system is not necessary to reach the best possible sensitivity. By adding an operator to the Hamiltonian we can also modify the time scaling of the channel quantum Fisher information. We illustrate our techniques with NV-center magnetometry and the estimation of the direction of a magnetic field in a given plane using a single spin-1 as probe.	benchmark (computing);channel state information;estimation theory;fisher information;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);mac flooding;maximal set;nv network;povm;quantum channel;quantum entanglement;quantum metrology	Julien Mathieu Elias Fraisse;Daniel Braun	2017	CoRR		classical mechanics;combinatorics;good quantum number;quantum number;amplitude damping channel;quantum capacity;mathematics;quantum channel;physics;quantum mechanics;covariant hamiltonian field theory;adiabatic quantum computation	Theory	41.17110147073904	16.73637244345168	120193

We show that for a loss estimator proposed earlier [2], it is not possible to derive strong concentration results for certain pathological input sequences. By modifying the estimator slightly we obtain a loss estimator for which the DUDE's estimated loss strongly concentrates around the true loss provided kM2k = o(n), where M is the size of the alphabet and n the sequence length. We also show that for certain channels, it is possible to estimate the best k using a combination of the two loss estimators. Moreover, for non-pathological sequences and k = o(n¼), we derive concentration results for the original loss estimator and all channels.	algorithm	Erik Ordentlich;Krishnamurthy Viswanathan;Marcelo J.

By “stability” we mean that the number of misses from the current support estimate and the number of extras in it remain bounded by a time-invariant value at all times. We show that, for a signal model with fixed signal power and support set size; support set changes allowed at every time; and gradual coefficient magnitude increase/decrease, “stabil ity” holds under mild assumptions – bounded noise, high enough minimum nonzero coefficient magnitude increase rate, and large enou gh number of measurements at every time. A direct corollary is t hat the reconstruction error is also bounded by a time-invariant value at all times. If the support of the sparse signal sequence cha nges slowly over time, our results hold under weaker assumptionsthan what simple compressive sensing (CS) needs for the same erro r bound. Also, our support error bounds are small compared to the support size. Our discussion is backed up by Monte Carlo simulation based comparisons.	algorithm;backup;coefficient;compressed sensing;least squares;monte carlo method;recursion (computer science);simulation;sparse matrix;time-invariant system	Namrata Vaswani	2011	CoRR		econometrics;mathematical optimization;information theory;mathematics;compressed sensing;least squares;statistics;monte carlo method	ML	49.05093534120963	9.364238565403413	120682

In particular, distributed conventional conjugate gradient (CCG) and modified conjugate gradient (MCG) algorithms are developed with incremental and diffusion adaptive cooperation strategies. The distributed CCG and MCG algorithms have an improved performance in terms of mean square error as compared with least–mean square (LMS)–based algorithms and a performance that is close to recursive least–squares (RLS) algorithms. In comparison with existing centralized or distributed estimation strategies, key features of the proposed algorithms are: 1) more accurate estimates and faster convergence speed can be obtained and 2) the design of preconditioners for CG algorithms, which can improve the performance of the proposed CG algorithms is presented. Simulations show the performance of the proposed CG algorithms against previously reported techniques for distributed parameter estimation and distributed spectrum estimation applications.	advanced transportation controller;algorithm;centralized computing;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;conjugate gradient method;estimation theory;iteration;least mean squares filter;mean squared error;preconditioner;recursion;recursive least squares filter;sparse;spectral density estimation	Songcen Xu;Rodrigo C. de Lamare;H.

This problem naturally arises in several settings such as ranked elections, multi-object tracking, ranking systems, and recommendation systems. Inspired by the work of Donoho and Stark in the context of discrete-time functions, we focus on non-negative functions with a sparse support (support size <;<; domain size). Our recovery method is based on finding the sparsest solution (through l0 optimization) that is consistent with the available information. As the main result, we derive sufficient conditions for functions that can be recovered exactly from partial information through l0 optimization. Under a natural random model for the generation of functions, we quantify the recoverability conditions by deriving bounds on the sparsity (support size) for which the function satisfies the sufficient conditions with a high probability as n → ∞. ℓ0 optimization is computationally hard. Therefore, the popular compressive sensing literature considers solving the convex relaxation, ℓ1 optimization, to find the sparsest solution. However, we show that ℓ1 optimization fails to recover a function (even with constant sparsity) generated using the random model with a high probability as n → ∞. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a novel iterative algorithm for the recovery of functions that satisfy the sufficient conditions. Finally, using an Information Theoretic framework, we study necessary conditions for exact recovery to be possible.	algorithm;compressed sensing;convex optimization;iterative method;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;recommender system;serializability;sparse matrix;theory	Srikanth Jagabathula;Devavrat Shah	2011	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2011.2165827	fourier transform;algorithm design;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;group theory;compressed sensing;statistics;recommender system	ML	48.13298203226574	8.082733194526767	121659

Let f be a nonnegative function on {0,1}<sup>n</sup>. We upper bound the entropy of Tϵ f by the average entropy of conditional expectations of f, given sets of roughly (1-2ϵ)<sup>2</sup> n variables. In information-theoretic terms, we prove the following strengthening of Mrs. Gerber's Lemma: let X be a random binary vector of length n, and let Z be a noise vector, corresponding to a binary symmetric channel with crossover probability ϵ. Then, setting v = (1-2ϵ)<sup>2</sup> · n, we have (up to lower order terms): H(X⊕Z) ≥ n · H<sub>2</sub> (ϵ+ (1-2ϵ) · H<sub>2</sub><sup>-1</sup> E<sub>|B| = v</sub> H ({X<sub>i</sub>}<sub>iϵB</sub>}/v))). Assuming ϵ ≥ 1/2 - δ, for some absolute constant δ > 0, this inequality, combined with a strong version of a theorem of Friedgut et al., due to Jendrej et al., shows that if a Boolean function f is close to a characteristic function g of a subcube of dimension n-1, then the entropy of T<sub>ϵ</sub>f is at most that of Tϵg. Taken together with a recent result of Ordentlich et al., this shows that the most informative Boolean function conjecture of Courtade and Kumar holds for high noise ϵ ≥1/2 - δ. Namely, if X is uniformly distributed in {0,1}<sup>n</sup> and Y is obtained by flipping each coordinate of X independently with probability ϵ, then, provided ϵ ≥ 1/2 - δ, for any Boolean function f holds I (f(X);Y) ≤ 1 - H(ϵ).	binary symmetric channel;bit array;boolean algebra;characteristic function (convex analysis);gerber format;information theory;rényi entropy;social inequality	Alex Samorodnitsky	2015	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2016.2584625	random variable;entropy;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;noise measurement;mathematics;boolean function;mutual information;statistics	Theory	44.8329577490625	16.0841395077718	121708

This structure is obtained from a deformed type of statistical mechanics that arises when configurational phase space is incompletely visited in an especially severe fashion. Specifically, the restriction is that the accessible fraction of this space has fractal properties. We obtain a generalized version of Benford’s law for data expressed in full and not by the first digit. The inverse functional of this expression is identified with the Zipf’s law; but it naturally includes the tails observed in real data for small rank. Thermodynamically, our version of Benford’s law expresses a Legendre transform between two entropy (or Massieu) potentials, while Zipf’s law is merely the expression that relates the corresponding partition functions.	fractal;legendre transformation;tails;three laws of robotics;zipf's law	Carlo Altamirano;Alberto Robledo	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02469-6_100	statistical physics;statistical mechanics;phase space;calculus;mathematics;legendre transformation;partition function;thermodynamics;benford's law;quantum mechanics	ML	45.5618128630427	11.887283602523931	122052

This paper considered the way to decrease the probability of false classification for compressive classifier. It is proved rigorously that the probability of false classification could be reduced by tightening the measurement matrix, that is, to simply make it row-orthogonal. As is known, equiangular tight frame (ETF) is the best choice in Comressive Classification for measurement matrix because of its optimal worst-case performance. But its existence and construction is problematic for some dimensions. So our results provided a convenient approach to improve the performance of compressive classifiers - The tightened measurement matrices could be better than before.

06ceffefeadee4a6850e910b837f7a3558b365a3	optimal containment of epidemics over temporal activity-driven networks		In this paper, we study the dynamics of epidemic processes taking place in temporal and adaptive networks. Building on the activity-driven network model, we propose an adaptive model of epidemic processes, where the network topology dynamically changes due to both exogenous factors independent of the epidemic dynamics as well as endogenous preventive measures adopted by individuals in response to the state of the infection. A direct analysis of the model using Markov processes involves the spectral analysis of a transition probability matrix whose size grows exponentially with the number of nodes. To overcome this limitation, we derive an upper-bound on the decay rate of the number of infected nodes in terms of the eigenvalues of a 2 × 2 matrix. Using this upper bound, we propose an efficient algorithm to tune the parameters describing the endogenous preventive measures in order to contain epidemics over time. We confirm our theoretical results via numerical simulations.	algorithm;coefficient;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;markov chain;markov property;network model;network topology;numerical analysis;rewrite (programming);spectral density estimation;stochastic matrix;the matrix;transformation matrix	Masaki Ogura;Victor M.

Such problem can be reformulated as two subproblems via the variable alternation method. Also, the analytical solutions of these two subproblems can be found. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can be regarded as an improved subspace-based method, which lowers the requirements in terms of snapshot number or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to outperform the diagonal-loading-type methods as compared with the traditional signal-subspace projection method.	beamforming;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);mathematical optimization;numerical method;optimization problem;requirement;signal subspace;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;snapshot (computer storage)	Jie Zhuang;Ping Huang	2012	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2012.2221709	random subspace method;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	EDA	51.03666407507683	7.94568701798189	122647

In order to avoid that limitation in the framework of Shannon statistics, Ferreri introduced in 1980 hypoentropy: “such conditions rarely occur in practice”. The aim of the present paper is to extend Ferreri’s hypoentropy to the Tsallis statistics. We introduce the Tsallis hypoentropy and the Tsallis hypodivergence and describe their mathematical behavior. Fundamental properties, like nonnegativity, monotonicity, the chain rule and subadditivity, are established.	kullback–leibler divergence;shannon (unit)	Shigeru Furuichi;Flavia-Corina Mitroi-Symeonidis;Eleutherius Symeonidis	2014	Entropy	10.3390/e16105377	calculus;mathematics;chain rule;subadditivity;tsallis entropy;statistics	ML	45.7800123024772	14.859686149583327	122877

Classical extreme value theory asserts that (under mild asymptotic independence assumptions) only three possible limit distributions are possible, namely: Gumbel, Fréchet and Weibull distribution. On the other hand, superstatistics contains three important universality classes, namely χ-superstatistics, inverse χ-superstatistics, and lognormal superstatistics, all maximizing different effective entropy measures. We investigate how the three classes of extreme value theory are related to the three classes of superstatistics. We show that for any superstatistical process whose local equilibrium distribution does not live on a finite support, the Weibull distribution cannot occur. Under the above mild asymptotic independence assumptions, we also show that χ-superstatistics generally leads an extreme value statistics described by a Fréchet distribution, whereas inverse χ-superstatistics, as well as lognormal superstatistics, lead to an extreme value statistics associated with the Gumbel distribution.	complex system;extreme value theory;markov chain;maxima and minima;microsoft outlook for mac;rare events;stationary process;stochastic process;superstatistics;time series;turbulence;universality probability	Pau Rabassa;Christian Beck	2014	Entropy	10.3390/e16105523	econometrics;generalized extreme value distribution;superstatistics;calculus;extreme value theory;mathematics;thermodynamics;physics;statistics;limit of a function	ML	43.87414703478221	12.355329967129963	123304
992b2d9d565bde3a414d1f573d4eca1129152df4	asymptotic optimality of d-cusum for quickest change detection under transient dynamics		The problem of quickest change detection (QCD) under transient dynamics is studied, in which the change from the initial distribution to the final persistent distribution does not happen instantaneously, but after a series of cascading transient phases. It is assumed that the durations of the transient phases are deterministic but unknown. The goal is to detect the change as quickly as possible subject to a constraint on the average run length to false alarm. The dynamic CuSum (D-CuSum) algorithm is investigated, which is based on reformulating the QCD problem into a dynamic composite hypothesis testing problem, and has a recursion that facilitates implementation. We show that this algorithm is adaptive to the unknown change point, as well as the unknown transient duration. And under mild conditions of the pre-change and post-change distributions, its asymptotic optimality is demonstrated for all possible asymptotic regimes as the transient duration and the average run length to false alarm go to infinity.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;goto;recursion;run-length encoding	Shaofeng Zou;Georgios Fellouris;Venugopal V.

The noise covariance function is assumed to be K(t,u) = \sigma^2 \pho(t,u) where \rho(t,u) is the known form of the covariance function and \sigma^2 is the unknown level. Classical approaches to signal detection depend on the assumption that K(t,u) is known completely. Then, a correlation-type receiver that is the uniformly most powerful (UMP) test of H_o (signal absent) versus H_1 (signal present) can be derived. When \sigma^2 is unknown, there exists no UMP test. However, it is shown in this paper that there exists a test of H_o versus H_1 that is UMP-invariant for a very natural group of transformations on the space of observations. The derived test is found to be independent of knowledge about the noise level \sigma^2 , since the derived test (receiver) contains an error-free estimate of \sigma^2 . This utopian conclusion is reconciled by noting that the derived receiver can never be physically realized. It is shown that any physically realizable version of the receiver has a t -distributed test statistic. This permits choice of operating receiver thresholds and evaluation of performance characteristics.		Louis L. Scharf;Dean W. Lytle	1971	IEEE Trans.

In statistics, the entropy corresponds to the maximum likelihood method, in which Kullback-Leibler divergence connects Boltzmann-Shannon entropy and the expected log-likelihood function. The maximum likelihood estimation has been supported for the optimal performance, which is known to be easily broken down in the presence of a small degree of model uncertainty. To deal with this problem, a new statistical method, closely related to Tsallis entropy, is proposed and shown to be robust for outliers, and we discuss a local learning property associated with the method.	boltzmann machine;entropy (information theory);kullback–leibler divergence;shannon (unit);tsallis entropy	Shinto Eguchi;Shogo Kato	2010	Entropy	10.3390/e12020262	entropy power inequality;econometrics;mathematical optimization;joint entropy;conditional quantum entropy;quantum relative entropy;power function;binary entropy function;rényi entropy;transfer entropy;maximum entropy probability distribution;principle of maximum entropy;mathematics;maximum entropy thermodynamics;joint quantum entropy;differential entropy;configuration entropy;cross entropy;maximum entropy spectral estimation;entropy rate;conditional entropy;tsallis entropy;min entropy;statistics;robustness	ML	45.745791167133156	14.872580523940071	123864

Together with existing upper bounds this result shows that the minimax distortion redundancy for empirical quantizer design, as a function of the size of the training data, is asymptotically on the order of n.

The idea is to construct a matrix characterizing the synchronization probabilities between various pairs of time series and examine the components of the principal eigenvector. We provide a heuristic argument indicating the existence of an approximate one-to-one correspondence between the components and the degrees of the nodes from which measurements are obtained. The striking finding is that such a correspondence appears to be quite robust, which holds regardless of the detailed node dynamics and of the network topology. Our computationally efficient method thus provides a general means to address the important problem of network detection, with potential applications in a number of fields.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;complex network;ethernet hub;heuristic;interaction;network topology;one-to-one (data model);stochastic matrix;time series	Liang Huang;Ying-Cheng Lai;Mary Ann F.

b3c216e414b47bc3c9136ee9de9569459f3e97a0	effectiveness analysis of a mixed rumor-quelling strategy		Abstract Circulating the truth and quarantining a subset of rumor spreaders are two major rumor-quelling strategies. In practice, a mixture of the two strategies may be more effective than any one of the two strategies. This paper focuses on effectiveness analysis of the mixed strategy. For this purpose, we are going to establish a rumor-truth competing model on two-layer network. First, we introduce a Markov model characterizing the stochastic dynamics of the rumor-truth competing process, and write the corresponding Kolmogorov model capturing the expected dynamics of the rumor-truth competing process. Second, we give a bilinear model as the first approximation to the Kolmogorov model, and suggest a generic model as a more accurate approximation to the Kolmogorov model. The two models are the focus of concern in this work. For ease in treatment, we describe a limit system of the generic model. By studying the limit model, we present a criterion for the rumor to subside, a criterion for the rumor not necessarily to subside, and a criterion for the rumor to persist, respectively. These findings are instructive to the quelling of false rumors. Finally, through computer experiments we find that when a rumor subsides, the bilinear model is a good approximation to the Kolmogorov model.

However, in most real-world engineering applications one faces the problem of analysing middle-sized systems in which the number of agents is bounded. In this paper we build on previous work in this area and introduce the mean drift. We present the concept of population processes and the conditions under which the approximation theorems apply, and then show how the mean drift is derived through a systematic application of the propagation of chaos. We then use the mean drift to construct a new set of ordinary differential equations which address the analysis of population processes with an arbitrary size.

In a multipath channel, the sensor collects the information via multiple paths. Depending on the angle-of-arrival distribution and other channel characteristics, different types of correlation appear in a vector sensor array, which affect the array performance. In this paper, a novel statistical framework is developed which provides closed-form parametric expressions for signal correlations in vector sensor arrays. Such correlation expressions serve as useful tools for system design and performance analysis of vector sensor signal processing algorithms. They can also be used to estimate some important physical parameters of the channel such as angle spreads, mean angle of arrivals, etc.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic fingerprint;algorithm;angle of arrival;multipath propagation;sensor;signal processing;systems design	Ali Abdi;Huaihai Guo	2009	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2008.2010012	underwater acoustic communication;telecommunications;signal processing;sensor array	Mobile	53.37411072843845	9.155947376216009	126276

In particular, the observer sequentially observes a sequence of observations {(xn, yn)}∞n=1, which is assumed to obey a linear regression model at each time slot n. Some of the coefficients in the linear model change at a fixed but unknown time t. The post-change linear coefficients are unknown to the observer. The observer aims to design an online algorithm to detect the model change based on his sequential observations. Two performance metrics, namely the worst case detection delay (WADD) and the average run length to false alarm (ARL2FA), are adopted to evaluate the performance of detection algorithms. We design a low complexity algorithm, termed as parallel sum algorithm, for the detection purpose. An asymptotic upper bound on WADD is provided under any given ARL2FA constraint.	best, worst and average case;coefficient;linear model;online algorithm;run-length encoding;sensor	Jun Geng;Bingwen Zhang;Lauren M.

This new uncertainty measure was conjectured to be invariant to the Rényi order α > 0 for the case of the optimizer signals of Hirschman Uncertainty (Picket Fence functions whose lengths are a perfect square). In this paper, we prove this invariance, and test whether this invariance is predictive in the problem of a simple texture classification for digital images. In the preliminary results, we find that it certainly influences the recognizer performance. Specifically, we find that the recognition performance does not depend significantly on the Rényi parameter α. We hope that these results will be extended to other problems where Rényi entropy is used.	computer vision;digital image;entropic uncertainty;entropy (information theory);finite-state machine;geo-fence;mathematical optimization;relevance;rényi entropy;shannon (unit);uncertainty principle;uncertainty theory	Kirandeep Ghuman;Victor E.

In real applications, the signal that the BS received is a distributed source because of the scattering, reflection, diffraction and refraction in the propagation path. In this paper, a 2D direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm for incoherently-distributed (ID) and coherently-distributed (CD) sources is proposed based on multiple VMIMO systems. ID and CD sources are separated through the second-order blind identification (SOBI) algorithm. The traditional estimating signal parameters via the rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT)-based algorithm is valid only for one-dimensional (1D) DOA estimation for the ID source. By constructing the signal subspace, two rotational invariant relationships are constructed. Then, we extend the ESPRIT to estimate 2D DOAs for ID sources. For DOA estimation of CD sources, two rational invariance relationships are constructed based on the application of generalized steering vectors (GSVs). Then, the ESPRIT-based algorithm is used for estimating the eigenvalues of two rational invariance matrices, which contain the angular parameters. The expressions of azimuth and elevation for ID and CD sources have closed forms, which means that the spectrum peak searching is avoided. Therefore, compared to the traditional 2D DOA estimation algorithms, the proposed algorithm imposes significantly low computational complexity. The intersecting point of two rays, which come from two different directions measured by two uniform rectangle arrays (URA), can be regarded as the location of the biosensor (wearable sensor). Three BSs adopting the smart antenna (SA) technique cooperate with each other to locate the wearable sensors using the angulation positioning method. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.	acid-base equilibrium;algorithm;angularjs;antenna device component;coded aperture;computational complexity theory;direction of arrival;epilepsy, generalized;estimated;neuromuscular disease, congenital, with uniform type 1 fiber (disorder);radiation;renin activity measurement;signal subspace;simulation;smart antenna;software propagation;wearable computer;sensor (device)	Liangtian Wan;Guangjie Han;Hao Wang;Lei Shu;Nanxing Feng;Bao Peng	2016	Sensors	10.3390/s16030368	electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	Robotics	49.50998633764099	4.428181271615264	126562

Therefore, a new method for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of far-field sources in mixed far-field and near-field signals with gain-phase error array is presented. First, fast Fourier transformation (FFT) is performed on the received data, then matrix transformation is used for simplifying the spectrum function, at last, DOA of far-field signals can be acquired by finding the roots of corresponding polynomial. There is no need to calibrate the array, simulations have shown that the proposed algorithm is effective.	direction of arrival	Jiaqi Zhen;Yanchao Li	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-78139-6_5	fast fourier transform;manifold;near and far field;direction finding;direction of arrival;control theory;mathematics;transformation matrix;polynomial;communication channel	EDA	52.3143995424601	7.473781666086507	126781
379b40e83cf625817cc44f1aea2e5dc8ebd589dd	a low computational complexity sml estimation algorithm of doa for wireless sensor networks		We address the problem of DOA estimation in positioning of nodes in wireless sensor networks. The Stochastic Maximum Likelihood (SML) algorithm is adopted in this paper. The SML algorithm is well-known for its high resolution of DOA estimation. However, its computational complexity is very high because multi dimensional nonlinear optimization problem is usually involved. To reduce the computational complexity of SML estimation, we do the following work. (1)We point out the problems of conventional SML criterion and explain why and how these problems happen. (2) A local AM search method is proposed which could be used to Find the local solution near/around the initial value. (3)We propose an algorithm which uses the local AM search method together with the estimation of DML or MUSIC as initial value to find the solution of SML. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. In particular, the algorithm which uses the local AM method and estimation of MUSIC as initial value has much higher resolution and comparable computational complexity to MUSIC.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;direction of arrival	Faming Gong;Haihua Chen;Shibao Li;Jianhang Liu;Zhaozhi Gu;Masakiyo Suzuki	2015	IJDSN	10.1155/2015/352012	mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;machine learning	Mobile	51.33318576074112	4.301541029676363	126964

For subspace-based algorithms, array sensors' position error may severely influence the estimation result since it changes the array in manifold. In this paper, we provide an improved DOA estimation method for general linear sensor array so that the effect of position error is minimized. We analytically present the relationship between sensor position error and the array's minimum resolution. Simulation results show that the new method does enhance the accuracy of the DOA estimation and the array resolution is determined by both the number of array sensors and the position error.	algorithm;charge-coupled device;direction of arrival;kernel density estimation;sensor;simulation	Siqian Liu;Hongxiang Li;Bei Gou	2013	2013 47th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)	10.1109/CISS.2013.6552300	speech recognition;sensor array;statistics	Robotics	52.64679161896993	7.394249927060713	127415

The map domain is partitioned into subintervals , each one containing orbits with their route characterized by a specific number of n successive ascents before a descent occurs. Then, Pn is defined as the probability to have an orbit performing n successive ascents, and equals the portion of the invariant measure within In. The rotation number is found to be equal to ω = P0 = P1, that is the portion of invariant measure within I0 or I1. Some significant applications of this relation concern (i) the rotation number dependence on the nonlinear parameter p, (ii) the analytical derivation of the rotation number, given the invariant density explicit expression, (iii) an easy computation of the rotation number that characterizes a periodic window. Moreover, the dependence of the ascent probabilities on the nonlinear parameter p is examined. Emphasis is placed on the discrete distribution of the ascent probabilities within the chaotic zone. A particular set of nonlinear parameter values is affiliated to the concept of ascent probabilities: For each probability Pn, n = 0, 1, 2, …, there is a lower limit of the nonlinear parameter values, p(n+1), so that, Pn = 0 ∀ p ≤ p(n+1). The set is analytically determined, and its specific arrangement in the chaotic zone is studied. Finally, the """"u-S-P equivalence"""" between the triplet of the set of the fixed point and its preimages, , of the invariant density S, and of the set of the ascents probabilities, , is formulated. In particular, we show that each component of this triplet can be estimated whenever the other two components are given.

This has been considered mainly for central symmetry of a Euclidean space in the origin. This paper enlarges the concept of modulation to the general setting of symmetry under the action of a compact topological group on the sample space. The main structural result relates the density of an arbitrary distribution to the density of the corresponding symmetrised distribution. Some general methods for constructing modulating functions are considered. The effect that transformations of the sample space have on symmetry of distributions is investigated. The results are illustrated by general examples, many of them in the setting of directional statistics.		Peter E. Jupp;Giuliana Regoli;Adelchi Azzalini	2016	J.

It is shown that if the likelihood ratios of the unquantized (or raw) observations are independent and contain no point-masses of probability, the optimal test does not randomize; this is so despite the fact that the data to be fused can be considered discrete.

In such nets the finite state space is generated by a finite set of linear equations. The regularity of this linear description can be used for a 'projection' (or 'folding') of the infinite state space into an equivalent finite representation that can be described by a finite set of nonlinear equilibrium equations. The solution of these equations determines the stationary probabilities of the states. Many performance measures can be obtained directly from this stationary solution. Such unbounded nets can eliminate the state explosion problem of some models by using unbounded but simple approximations to bounded but complex models. >	performance evaluation;petri net	Wlodzimierz M.

We consider this quickest change detection problem with an additional constraint on the average energy consumed in sensing the observations. The optimal algorithm for this problem has a three threshold structure, in contrast to the single threshold Shiryaev test that is optimal for the classical Bayesian quickest change detection problem. We provide an asymptotic analysis of the three threshold policy for the case where the probability of false alarm is small, the average energy consumption is large, and the change event is rare. The analysis yields approximations for the average detection delay, probability of false alarm and average energy consumption, which can be used to optimize the thresholds to achieve desired operating points. The asymptotic analysis also reveals that the three threshold policy can be approximated by a simpler two threshold policy. The advantage of the two threshold policy is that the thresholds can be set directly using constraints on the probability of false alarm and average energy consumption. We provide extensive simulation results that corroborate our analytical findings.	approximation algorithm;simulation	Taposh Banerjee;Venugopal V.

Most studies for RSS localization assume that the shadowing components are uncorrelated. However in this paper, we assume that the shadowing is spatially correlated. Under this condition, it can be shown that the localization accuracy can be improved if the correlation among links is taken into consideration. Avoiding the maximum likelihood (ML) convergence problem, we derive a novel semidefinite programming (SDP) approach by converting the corresponding noncovex ML estimator into a convex one. The performance of the proposed SDP estimator is compared with the ML estimator and previously considered estimators. Computer simulations show that the proposed SDP estimator outperforms the previously considered estimators in both uncorrelated and correlated shadowing environments.	internationalization and localization;rss;semidefinite programming;simulation	Reza Monir Vaghefi;R.

It also demands the sensor positions to be accurate. Achieving synchronization may not be feasible when the sensors are widely separated or are many, and precise sensor positions are often not available in practice. This paper investigates TDOA localization using a set of imperfect sensors, where timing synchronization offsets and random position errors exist among different sensor groups. The degradation in localization accuracy caused by synchronization offsets and position errors is examined through the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analysis under Gaussian noise. A novel method in obtaining sequentially algebraic solutions of the source location, the sensor positions, and the synchronization offsets is developed. Sequential estimation simplifies the localization task and offers complexity reduction. The performance of the proposed estimates is shown to reach the CRLB accuracy analytically using small noise analysis, although they are estimated sequentially and not jointly. Simulations support and corroborate the theoretical developments.	elegant degradation;internationalization and localization;multilateration;reduction (complexity);sampling (signal processing);sensor;simulation preorder;synchronization (computer science)	Yue Wang;K.

In this study, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is employed to characterise the total spatial PSD of multiple ID sources, and two algorithms are proposed to estimate the parameters of the GMM. The first one is the covariance fitting method for multiple ID sources with Gaussian PSD, and the other is the iterative expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm. Simulation studies demonstrate that the EM algorithm outperforms other methods in approximating the shape of the total spatial PSD, especially for small spatial spread.	approximation;mixture model;spectral density	Huigang Wang;Shanlong Li;Huxiong Li;Yang Shi	2013	IET Signal Processing	10.1049/iet-spr.2011.0328	econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics	ML	51.85137489945493	9.783261830979182	128583

However, experimentation shows that this`noise insensitivity' is traded for increased variability of the parameter estimates. The main purpose of this contribution is to derive and work out closed form expressions of the asymptotic covariance of MUSIC-like direction-of-arrival estimates based on two fourth-order cumulant matrices: the diagonal slice and the contracted quadricovariance. This is compared to the standard covariance based MUSIC estimate establishing on a rational basis the domain of applicability of higher-order statistics for DOA estimation. In particular, the actual impact of the noise variance and of the dynamic range of the sources is investigated. This asymptotic performance analysis is achieved within a general framework, which we believe to be of general interest.	algorithm;array processing;direction of arrival;dynamic range;spatial variability	Jean-François Cardoso;Eric Moulines	1995	IEEE Trans.

In this paper, we propose joint range, angle and Doppler estimation for FDA-multiple-input multiple-output (FDA-MIMO) radar. In order to reduce the computation complexity, the Doppler is independently estimated firstly by the extended invariance principle instead of maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. Next, the range and angle are estimated separately with the unstructured model. That is, the three-dimensional search problem of joint range, angle and Doppler estimation is simplified into three one-dimensional search problems. The superiorities of the proposed method over conventional ML algorithms are verified by numerical results.	algorithm;computation;estimation theory;mimo;numerical analysis;pulse-doppler radar;search problem	Jian Xu;Wen-Qin Wang;Can Cui;Ronghua Gui	2018	2018 IEEE 10th Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop (SAM)	10.1109/SAM.2018.8448782	mimo;estimator;search problem;computer science;mathematical optimization;radar;doppler effect;maximum likelihood;doppler radar	Robotics	52.322867766070736	7.109963594208778	129106

Shannon famously considered a scheme that instantaneously samples the signal at equispaced times. He proved that the signal can be reconstructed as long as the sampling rate exceeds twice the bandwidth (Nyquist rate). Candès, Romberg, Tao introduced a scheme that acquires instantaneous samples of the signal at random times. They proved that the signal can be uniquely and efficiently reconstructed, provided the sampling rate exceeds the frequency support of the signal, times logarithmic factors. In this paper we consider a probabilistic model for the signal, and a sampling scheme inspired by the idea of spatial coupling in coding theory. Namely, we propose to acquire non-instantaneous samples at random times. Mathematically, this is implemented by acquiring a small random subset of Gabor coefficients. We show empirically that this scheme achieves correct reconstruction as soon as the sampling rate exceeds the frequency support of the signal, thus reaching the information theoretic limit.	chroma subsampling;coding theory;coefficient;gabor filter;information theory;nyquist rate;romberg's method;sampling (signal processing);shannon (unit);sparse matrix;statistical model;stochastic process	Adel Javanmard;Andrea Montanari	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283951	nyquist frequency;signal reconstruction;stochastic process;oversampling;discrete-time signal;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;probability;mathematics;sampling;statistics	Theory	50.40270104572074	15.339587999094778	129138

eac71ea35bb1608a0609c7a2af8d89dbf13c3808	mixed far-field and near-field source localization based on subarray cross-cumulant		Abstract This paper presents a new algorithm for mixed far-field and near-field source localization using a uniform linear array (ULA). Firstly, the ULA is divided into two overlapping subarrays to construct two special cross-cumulant matrices of the subarray outputs, which are only characterized by directions-of-arrival (DOAs) of the sources. Then, the shift invariance structure in the cumulant domain is derived, and the DOAs of all sources are estimated by the TLS-ESPRIT method. Finally, with the estimated DOAs, the range estimates of near-field sources are obtained via one-dimensional search, and the types of sources are also distinguished. The developed algorithm involves neither DOA search nor parameter pairing. Furthermore, it exhibits a higher localization accuracy than the traditional methods. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

These processes can be seen as a generalization of Markov random fields restricted to one dimension. Non stationary reciprocal processes have been extensively studied in the past especially by Krener, Levy and co-workers. However the specialization of the nonstationary results to the stationary case does not seem to have been pursued in sufficient depth in the literature. Processes (and stochastic models) of this kind are especially useful for describing phenomena which naturally live in a finite region of the “time” (or space) line, like say stationary images. Identification of these models starting from observed data seems to be a completely open problem which can in principle lead to many interesting applications in signal processing. In this paper we describe two approaches to identification of reciprocal processes; one is based on covariance matching (like in the method of moments) and the other is based on maximum likelihood. While the first leads to the solution of a linear system of the Yule-Walker type, the second approach leads to a circulant band extension problem which is intrisically nonlinear and does not seem to have been discussed in the literature.	amiga walker;boundary element method;circulant matrix;linear system;markov chain;markov random field;nonlinear system;partial template specialization;signal processing;stationary process;stochastic process;timeline	Giorgio Picci;Francesca P.

Based on this observation, the paper then considers the formation of confidence regions for the signal parameters. The paper presents the gensral case of a multi—dimensional eigenstructure algorithm, which estimates one or more parameters of each signal in the observed data.	algorithm;eigen (c++ library);spectral density estimation	Ken Sharman;Tariq S.

edfab19db037c1857d7aea64e7ff3deee77cb8b8	the power laws of geodesics in some random sets with dilute concentration of inclusions		A method for computing upper-bounds on the length of geodesics spanning random sets in 2D and 3D is proposed, with emphasis on Boolean models containing a vanishingly small surface or volume fraction of inclusions f ≪ 1. The distance function is zero inside the grains and equal to the Euclidean distance outside of them, and the geodesics are shortest paths connecting two points far from each other. The asymptotic behavior of the upper-bounds is derived in the limit f → 0. The scalings involve powerlaws with fractional exponents ~f 2/3 for Boolean sets of disks or aligned squares and ~f 1/2 for the Boolean set of spheres. These results are extended to models of hyperspheres in arbitrary dimension and, in 2D and 3D, to a more general problem where the distance function is non-zero in the inclusions. Finally, other fractional exponents are derived for the geodesics spanning multiscale Boolean sets, based on inhomogeneous Poisson point processes, in 2D and 3D.

Because ln p  is additive, basic analytics could be applied to information, such as the average which forms entropy and the average difference which forms divergence. Unnecessarily neglected in this formative framework for information theory, is the equally important fact that translating entropy back into probability space gives the geometric mean of the distribution, . i p i i p  This is also the inverse of the perplexity, but	entropy (information theory);information system;information theory;perplexity;shannon (unit);utility functions on indivisible goods	Kenric P.

This work is supposed to derive a nearly complete list of corresponding properties concerning the cdf’s and some related functions for Beta as well as for central and non-central Chi-square and F distributions, where hitherto only partial results were available. To this end we introduce a generalized reproductive property, thereby extending the relationships between total positivity of order 2, log-concavity and reproductivity developed in Das Gupta and Sarkar (1984). The key to our results are log-concavity properties of the non-central Chi-square distribution with zero degrees of freedom introduced by Siegel (1979). Finally one of the results for the central F distribution is used to solve a monotonicity problem for a stepwise multiple F-test procedure for all pairwise comparisons of k means.	chi;concave function;k-means clustering;methods of computing square roots;stepwise regression	Helmut Finner;Markus Roters	1996	Universität Trier, Mathematik/Informatik, Forschungsbericht		calculus;mathematics;statistics	Theory	44.28757672415089	15.531546928978795	133301

Performance of these methods is evaluated by the average run length (ARL), which captures the frequency of false alarms, and the detection delay. Numerical comparisons show that the ES method performs the best; however, it is exponentially complex. The Mixture method is polynomially complex by exploiting the fact that the size of the community is typically small in a large network. However, it may react to a group of active edges that do not form a community. This issue is resolved by the H-Mix method, which is based on a dendrogram decomposition of the network. We present an asymptotic analytical expression for ARL of the Mixture method when the threshold is large.	algorithm;dendrogram;emergence;exploit (computer security);numerical method;online community;random graph;run-length encoding;sensor	David Marangoni-Simonsen;Yao Xie	2015	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2014.2381553	telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;data mining;software testing;statistics	ML	44.96552716462527	6.82025577976206	133464

The solution is valid for arbitrarily small observation intervals; that is, the assumption T>> tau /sub c/, mod d mod made in the derivation of the conventional asymptotic maximum likelihood (AML) time delay estimator (where tau /sub c/ is the correlation time of the various random processes involved and d is the differential time delay) is relaxed. The resulting exact maximum likelihood (EML) instrumentation is shown to consist of a finite-time delay-and-sum beamformer, followed by a quadratic postprocessor based on the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a one-dimensional integral equation with nonconstant weight. The solution of this integral equation is obtained for the case of stationary signals with rational power spectral densities. Finally, the performance of the EML and AML estimators is compared by means of computer simulations. >	broadcast delay	Benoît Champagne;Moshe Eizenman;Subbarayan Pasupathy	1991	IEEE Trans.

We show that this smoothed 1/f phase noise results in a finite variance noise process and preserves oscillator stationarity. Furthermore, in agreement with experimental data, we explain how a quadratic and a logarithmic term appear in the autocorrelation function and establish the relationship between the logarithmic term and the 1/f characteristics of the oscillator random process.	allan variance;autocorrelation;phase noise;pink noise;smoothing;spectral density;stationary process;stochastic process	Arsenia Chorti;Mike Brookes	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - ICASSP '07	10.1109/ICASSP.2007.366852	stochastic process;noise spectral density;econometrics;autocorrelation;mathematics;oscillation;phase noise;statistics	EDA	53.488470899128764	14.581188028832443	134851

By definition, a universal code (or a universal lossless data compressor) can compress any sequence generated by a stationary and ergodic source asymptotically to the Shannon entropy, which, in turn, is the best achievable ratio for lossless data compressors. We consider finite-alphabet and real-valued time series and the following problems: estimation of the limiting probabilities for finite-alphabet time series and estimation of the density for real-valued time series, the on-line prediction, regression, classification (or problems with side information) for both types of the time series and the following problems of hypothesis testing: goodness-of-fit testing, or identity testing, and testing of serial independence. It is important to note that all problems are considered in the framework of classical mathematical statistics and, on the other hand, everyday methods of data compression (or archivers) can be used as a tool for the estimation and testing. It turns out, that quite often the suggested methods and tests are more powerful than known ones when they are applied in practice.	autocorrelation;data compression;entropy (information theory);ergodicity;lossless compression;online and offline;shannon (unit);stationary process;time series;universal code (data compression)	Boris Ryabko	2008	CoRR		data compression;econometrics;statistical hypothesis testing;information theory;entropy encoding;theoretical computer science;time series;mathematics;goodness of fit;statistics;entropy;source code	Theory	46.7828478346985	13.377076896603295	134871

The novelty of this paper is that we present an efficient algorithm to estimate two DOAs from their wrapped phases with errors. The proposed robust generalized Chinese remainder theorem is considerably less computational complex than the searching method while maintaining comparable estimation precision. Moreover, the largest range of DOA that leads to an unambiguous determination is obtained for a given coprime array. Numerical simulations are presented to verify the efficiency and the robustness of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is much faster than the searching method while achieving a similar root-mean-square error.

These applications often require performance evaluation and sensor design for HMM estimation algorithms. This article approaches the performance evaluation and design problems from a structural perspective. Specifically, for a special class of flag HMMs (where sensors accurately flag a subset of states), explicit formulae are derived for the average error probability of the maximum-likelihood estimate. These formulae are used to optimally place sensors, and to gain an understanding of the relationship between the HMMs structure and estimation error. Three examples, including a real-world case study on monitoring the elderly in a smart home, are presented.	algorithm;computation;hidden markov model;home automation;markov chain;performance evaluation;sensor	Kyle Doty;Sandip Roy;Dinuka Sahabandu;Ramyar Saeedi	2015	2015 49th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)	10.1109/CISS.2015.7086876	machine learning;hidden semi-markov model;pattern recognition;mathematics;markov model;hidden markov model;statistics;variable-order markov model	Mobile	48.50547718901429	11.42439191661392	135926

The algorithm is based on Metropolis Monte Carlo sampling. The algorithm samples from a stretched Boltzmann distribution π(w) = (|w|+ 1)αβ|w| · Z−1 where |w| is the length of a word w, α and β are parameters of the algorithm, and Z is a normalising constant. It follows that words of the same length are sampled with the same probability. The distribution can be expressed in terms of the cogrowth series of the group, which then allows us to relate statistical properties of words sampled by the algorithm to the cogrowth of the group, and hence its amenability. We have implemented the algorithm and applied it to several group presentations including the Baumslag-Solitar groups, some free products studied by Kouksov, a finitely presented amenable group that is not subexponentially amenable (based on the basilica group), and Richard Thompson’s group F .	arbitrary-precision arithmetic;computer cluster;magma;markov chain;metropolis;metropolis–hastings algorithm;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;perimeter;sampling (signal processing);state space;stationary process;stu moment;the australian;westgrid	Murray Elder;Andrew Rechnitzer;Esaias J.

We propose a new distributed DOA estimation algorithms based on the randomized Gossip method, the goal of which is to realize the conventional Capon method by a distributed way. The proposed algorithm does not require any constraint on the network geometries, thereby making it suitable for distributed signal processing in large wireless sensor networks.

Many methods involve the extrapolation of random jitter (RJ) and random noise (RN) to very low BER, assuming that RJ is white Gaussian noise. In reality, RJ spectra are not always white. Thus, RJ statistical distributions can deviate from an ideal Gaussian, affecting the accuracy of extrapolations. This paper presents a theory and model for relating RJ distributions with colored spectra. We apply this model to various filtered RJ spectra, including the extreme case of Brownian (1/f2) noise, and show correlation between simulation and measurement.	bit error rate;extrapolation;mathematical model;noise (electronics);rca spectra 70;registered jack;simulation;spectral density;x.690	Daniel Chow;Masashi Shimanouchi;Mike P.

To prove this we use exponential family representations of MRFs. We first show that the entropy of an MRF is monotone decreasing in the exponential parameters. We then use the Maximum Entropy principle and a well-known result from information geometry to show that the marginal entropy of XU is upper bounded by the MRF on the induced subgraph with moments matching the marginal distribution. We then use the convexity of the log-partition function to show that to match the marginal moments on the induced subgraph, the exponential coordinates on the induced subgraph are component-wise greater than the corresponding parameter of the original exponential characterization. Our result follows from monotonicity.	induced subgraph;information geometry;marginal model;markov chain;markov random field;partition function (mathematics);principle of maximum entropy;time complexity;monotone	Matthew G.

The algorithm's utility has been demonstrated empirically. Considering theoretic performance analyses of the ASB detection algorithm as well as the AMF generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), and the adaptive cosine estimator (ACE), under nonideal conditions, can become fairly intractable rather quickly, especially in an adaptive processing context involving covariance estimation. In this paper, however, we have developed and exploited a theoretic framework through which the performance of these algorithms under nonhomogeneous conditions can be examined theoretically. It is demonstrated through theoretic analysis that in the presence of undernulled interference, the ASB is a pliable false alarm regulatory (FAR) detector that maintains good target sensitivity. A viable method of ASB threshold selection is also presented and demonstrated.	algorithm	Christ D. Richmond	2000	IEEE Trans.

We introduced a new mathematical framework and several new concepts, such as periodicity, autocorrelation, and spectral density function to analyze scale stationary and p-self similar processes. In particular, we introduced a family of finite parameter scale stationary models, similar in spirit to ARMA models by which any scale stationary processes can be approximated. In this work, we utilized the framework of scale stationary processes and introduced novel methods of 1/f signal modeling and parameter estimation techniques. These include a sampling theorem, a mathematically consistent estimator for the self-similarity parameter, an unbiased estimator for the scale autocorrelation function and a maximum likelihood estimator for scale stationary autoregressive models. Results from our study suggest that scale stationary processes provide a powerful framework for practical 1/f signal processing problems.	estimation theory;pink noise;stationary process	Birsen Yazici;Rangasami L.

We develop a general analytical framework for studying percolation of n interdependent networks. We illustrate our analytical solutions for three examples: (i) For any tree of n fully dependent Erdős-Rényi (ER) networks, each of average degree k, we find that the giant component is P∞ =p[1-exp(-kP∞)](n) where 1-p is the initial fraction of removed nodes. This general result coincides for n = 1 with the known second-order phase transition for a single network. For any n>1 cascading failures occur and the percolation becomes an abrupt first-order transition. (ii) For a starlike network of n partially interdependent ER networks, P∞ depends also on the topology-in contrast to case (i). (iii) For a looplike network formed by n partially dependent ER networks, P∞ is independent of n.	anatomy, regional;cascading failure;erdős number;erdős–rényi model;first-order predicate;giant component;interdependence;interdependent networks;percolation;phase transition	Jianxi Gao;Sergey V.

Our approach is to have the probability space extend over both space and time and to consider the probability that a random N -bit program has halted by a random time. We postulate an a priori computable probability distribution on all possible runtimes and we prove that given an integer k > 0, we can effectively compute a time bound T such that the probability that an N -bit program will eventually halt given that it has not halted by T is smaller than 2−k . We also show that the set of halting programs (which is computably enumerable, but not computable) can be written as a disjoint union of a computable set and a set of effectively vanishing probability. Finally, we show that “long” runtimes are effectively rare. More formally, the set of times at which an N -bit program can stop after the time 2N+constant has effectively zero density. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The optimization of subarray partition for large planar phased array radar according to weighted K-means clustering method is mainly investigated in this paper. Based on the excitation matching technique, the optimization of subarray partition in monopulse application can be reformulated as a clustering of reference gain ratios to minimize the excitation matching error. However, when the element weights are non-uniform for specific intentions such as low sidelobes, the matching error could not be minimized completely by traditional K-means clustering. Therefore, in this paper, a weighted K-means clustering method is proposed to reduce the matching error by modifying the membership rule and cluster center of K-means clustering. The proposed method can provide smaller matching error compared with conventional clustering methods, especially when the elements are weighted non-uniformly. The effectiveness of proposed method is validated by numerical simulations and compared with several classical clustering methods.	cluster analysis;computer simulation;iterative method;k-means clustering;mathematical optimization;monopulse radar;numerical analysis;partition type;phased array	Xiaopeng Yang;Wen Xi;Yuze Sun;Tao Zeng;Teng Long;Tapan K.

Our signal model includes a class of time-limited signals for which we collect data in the sequential fashion at discrete points in the presence of correlated noise. For such a setup we introduce a novel signal detection algorithm relying on the postfiltering smooth correction of the classical Whittaker-Shannon interpolation series. Given a finite frame of noisy samples of the signal, we design a detection algorithm being able to detect a departure from a reference signal as quickly as possible. Our detector is represented as a normalized partial-sum continuous time stochastic process, for which we obtain a functional central limit theorem under weak assumptions on the correlation structure of the noise. Particularly, our results allow for noise processes such as ARMA and general linear processes as well as α-mixing processes. The established limit theorems allow us to design monitoring algorithms with the desirable level of the probability of false alarm and able to detect a change with probability approaching one.	algorithm;bandlimiting;detection theory;shannon (unit);stochastic process;whittaker–shannon interpolation formula	Miros&#x0142;aw Pawlak;Ansgar Steland	2013	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2013.2243200	signal reconstruction;step detection;stochastic process;econometrics;mathematical optimization;autocorrelation;signal transfer function;interpolation;mathematics;statistics;detection theory	ML	53.041793905319935	11.985407802978324	140909

Situations such as this often arise in airborne direction finding when skywave multipath is present. A parameterization that accounts for “uncalibrated” spatial signatures (USS) is proposed, and the identifiability of the resulting model is established. The asymptotically optimal signal and noise subspace fitting algorithms are applied to the USS model, and efficient implementations for each are derived that involve a search only for the DOAs of signals with “calibrated” spatial signatures (CSS). In addition, a sequential detection scheme is proposed for individually determining the number of USS and CSS signals. The results of several simulation examples are included to validate the analysis.	airborne ranger;asymptotically optimal algorithm;cascading style sheets;detection theory;direction finding;direction of arrival;multipath propagation;simulation;skywave;type signature;unix system services	A.

Modern sensors have significant processing capabilities that allow for in situ processing and exploitation of the information to select what additional information to collect. In this paper, we discuss a class of dynamic, adaptive search problems involving multiple sensors sensing for a single stationary object, and formulate them as stochastic control problems with imperfect information. The objective of these problems is related to information entropy. This allows for a complete characterization of the optimal strategies and the optimal cost for the resulting finite-horizon stochastic control problems. We show that the computation of optimal policies can be reduced to solving a finite number of strictly concave maximization problems. We further show that the solution can be decoupled into a finite number of scalar concave maximization problems. We illustrate our results with experiments using multiple sensors searching for a single object.	computation;concave function;convex optimization;differential entropy;entropy (information theory);expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;information processing;information theory;internationalization and localization;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;performance tuning;sensor;shannon (unit);stationary process;stochastic control	Huanyu Ding;David A.

0c9c3a9b0dc0e44e641b92e4646e5198ad8a27eb	finite time distributions of stochastically modeled chemical systems with absolute concentration robustness		Recent research in both the experimental and mathematical communities has focused on biochemical interaction systems that satisfy an “absolute concentration robustness” (ACR) property. The ACR property was first discovered experimentally when, in a number of different systems, the concentrations of key system components at equilibrium were observed to be robust to the total concentration levels of the system. Followup mathematical work focused on deterministic models of biochemical systems and demonstrated how chemical reaction network theory can be utilized to explain this robustness. Later mathematical work focused on the behavior of this same class of reaction networks, though under the assumption that the dynamics were stochastic. Under the stochastic assumption, it was proven that the system will undergo an extinction event with a probability of one so long as the system is conservative, showing starkly different long-time behavior than in the deterministic setting. Here we consider a general class of stochastic models that intersects with the class of ACR systems studied previously. We consider a specific system scaling over compact time intervals and prove that in a limit of this scaling the distribution of the abundances of the ACR species converges to a certain product-form Poisson distribution whose mean is the ACR value of the deterministic model. This result is in agreement with recent conjectures pertaining to the behavior of ACR networks endowed with stochastic kinetics, and helps to resolve the conflicting theoretical results pertaining to deterministic and stochastic models in this setting.	chemical reaction network theory;experiment;image scaling;key;kinetics internet protocol;stochastic process	David F.

ba418e71e779d1ef3a9938f129f3cbbcad9b6e65	testing equality of multiple power spectral density matrices		This paper studies the existence of optimal invariant detectors for determining whether  $P$ multivariate processes have the same power spectral density. This problem finds application in multiple fields, including physical layer security and cognitive radio. For Gaussian observations, we prove that the optimal invariant detector, i.e., the uniformly most powerful invariant test, does not exist. Additionally, we consider the challenging case of close hypotheses, where we study the existence of the locally most powerful invariant test (LMPIT). The LMPIT is obtained in the closed form only for univariate signals. In the multivariate case, it is shown that the LMPIT does not exist. However, the corresponding proof naturally suggests an LMPIT-inspired detector that outperforms previously proposed detectors.	cognitive radio;sensor;spectral density	David Ramírez;Daniel Romero;Javier Vía;Roberto López-Valcarce;Ignacio Santamaría	2018	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2018.2875884	mathematical optimization;time series;toeplitz matrix;multivariate statistics;matrix (mathematics);detector;mathematics;spectral density;invariant (mathematics);univariate	ML	49.11607378516781	13.131916949246435	141985

Adaptive processing structures are presented to remove both side lobe and main lobe electromagnetic interference and intrinsically perform waveform compression when coded radar waveforms are transmitted. Moreover, the processing schemes derived from the GL are decomposed into a cascade of basic processing steps. This can be directly related to the structure of conventional radar schemes, where each processing block is properly optimized. The detection performance is studied by closed form expressions, that show the intrinsic CFAR properties of the considered generalized likelihood ratio test. Then the target DoA estimation accuracy is quanti""""ed by the Cramer Rao lower bound.

95a0e979ad10907cb22dfb0fee4ab35f05cacd1f	efficient source enumeration for accurate direction-of-arrival estimation in threshold region	joint detection and estimation;esprit;source enumeration;threshold region;direction of arrival doa estimation	a r t i c l e i n f o a b s t r a c t Estimation of the number of signals impinging on an array of sensors, also known as source enumeration, is usually required prior to direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. In challenging scenarios such as the presence of closely-spaced sources and/or high level of noise, using the true source number for nonlinear parameter estimation leads to the threshold effect which is characterized by an abnormally large mean square error (MSE). In cases that sources have distinct powers and/or are closely spaced, the error distribution among parameter estimates of different sources is unbalanced. In other words, some estimates have small errors while others may be quite inaccurate with large errors. In practice, we will be only interested in the former and have no concern on the latter. To formulate this idea, the concept of effective source number (ESN) is proposed in the context of joint source enumeration and DOA estimation. The ESN refers to the actual number of sources that are visible at a given noise level by a parameter estimator. Given the numbers of sensors and snapshots, number of sources, source parameters and noise level, a Monte Carlo method is designed to determine the ESN, which is the maximum number of available accurate estimates. The ESN has a theoretical value in that it is useful for judging what makes a good source enumerator in the threshold region and can be employed as a performance benchmark of various source enumerators. Since the number of sources is often unknown, its estimate by a source enumerator is used for DOA estimation. In an effort to automatically remove inaccurate estimates while keeping as many accurate estimates as possible, we define the matched source number (MSN) as the one which in conjunction with a parameter estimator results in the smallest MSE of the parameter estimates. We also heuristically devise a detection scheme that attains the MSN for ESPRIT based on the combination of state-of-the-art source enumerators.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);direction of arrival;echo state network;enumerator (computer science);enumerator polynomial;estimation theory;heuristic;high-level programming language;kernel density estimation;mean squared error;monte carlo method;noise (electronics);nonlinear system;scheme;sensor;simulation;unbalanced circuit	Kefei Liu;Hing-Cheung So;João Paulo Carvalho Lustosa da Costa;Florian Roemer;Lei Huang	2013	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2013.06.009	econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics	Metrics	50.018679233271634	9.289587394131415	142218

By comparing the performance with the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB), it proves that the ability of the differential calibration algorithm to restrain these errors depends heavily on the parameters of the calibration sources. Then the influences of their amount, positions and measurement accuracy to the location accuracy are discussed.

A closed-form expression for the probability of false alarm of this detector is derived. In addition, a MIMO version of the persymmetric sample matrix inversion (MIMO-PSMI) detector is also developed. Compared to the MIMO-PGLRT detector, MIMO-PSMI has a simpler form and is computationally more efficient. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that the proposed two detection algorithms can significantly alleviate the requirement of the amount of secondary data and allow for a noticeable improvement in detection performance.	algorithm;mimo	Jun Liu;Hongbin Li;Braham Himed	2015	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2014.130652	training set;detector;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;noise;control theory;mathematics	Vision	51.22718513930375	9.556269044609829	142542

Further, it captures essential features of the scaling properties of the agreement process for spatially embedded autonomous agents. Among the relevant observables capturing the temporal properties of the agreement process, we investigate the cluster-size distribution and the distribution of the agreement times, both exhibiting dynamic scaling.

While many algorithms can be found in the literature, no benchmark exists and most papers fail to compare their results to other competing algorithms. To our knowledge, the algorithm which achieves the best performance in sensor location uses semidefinite relaxation of a quadratic program to solve for sensor location. We propose solving the same program, however without relaxing the constraints, but rather transforming them into linear triangle inequality constraints. Our linear program ensures a tighter solution to the problem. We benchmark ours against the competing algorithm, and provide extensive experimentation to substantiate the robustness of our algorithm even in the presence of high levels of noise.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);centralized computing;experiment;kahn process networks;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;quadratic programming;relaxation (approximation);sensor;social inequality	Anthony Gentile	2005	IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2005.

The HISS estimator uses the observations of node states at a particular time, where the elapsed time from the start of the infection is unknown. It is able to incorporate side information (if any) of the observed states of a subset of nodes at different times, and of the prior probability of each infected or recovered node to be the infection source.

An auxiliary sensors-based framework is proposed, the matched array measurement of the MIMO radar is formulated as a parallel factor (PARAFAC) model, which links the problem of joint DOD and DOA estimation to PARAFAC decomposition. Thereafter, the DODs and DOAs are obtained via least square strategy. The proposed method is computationally more efficient than the existing reduced-MUSIC method. Besides, it can achieve closed-form solutions for DODs and DOAs, which are paired automatically. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.	algorithm;direction of arrival;estimation theory;experiment;mimo;numerical method;sensor;simulation	Fanaqing Wen;Lei Wu;Changxin Cai;Dongmei Huang	2018	2018 IEEE 10th Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop (SAM)	10.1109/SAM.2018.8448562	bistatic radar;mathematical optimization;computer science;mimo;radar;least squares	Robotics	52.54964482865958	7.4829217220945035	144993

A class of Markov data process distributions is considered which satisfy a one-shift dependency bound and agree with a specified univariate distribution. Within this dependency contamination class the distribution structure which minimizes the exponential rate of decrease of detection error probabilities is identified. This is a uniform least-favorability principle, because the least-favorable dependency structure is the same for all bounded memoryless detectors. The error probability exponential rate criterion used is a device of large deviations theory. The results agree well with previous results obtained using Pitman's asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE), which is a more tractable small-signal performance criterion. In contrast to ARE, large deviations theory is closely related to finite-sample error probabilities via the finite-sample Chernoff bounds and other exponentially tight bounds and other approximations.	chernoff bound	John S.

745f81d1492b6ba0e88ff7ea80ddee68210819bc	maximum entropy principle in fields of probabilities. application to self-organizing systems	maximum entropy principle;self organizing system	The maximum entropy principle is considered in fields of probabilities. A model of global or total entropy is suggested that is supported by the entropy of deterministic functions, on the one hand, and by the so-called monkey model of entropy of images on the other hand. Then some applications of the MaxEnt entropy so obtained are outlined. When one analyzes families of systems, one has to consider conditional entropies given the spatial distribution of these systems, and it is shown how the corresponding MaxEnt principle applies to self-organizing systems. The approach can be generalized to the minimum cross-entropy principle in fields of probabilities.	organizing (structure);principle of maximum entropy	Guy Jumarie	1997	Cybernetics and Systems	10.1080/019697297126119	joint entropy;conditional quantum entropy;quantum relative entropy;generalized relative entropy;binary entropy function;rényi entropy;transfer entropy;maximum entropy probability distribution;computer science;principle of maximum entropy;calculus;mathematics;maximum entropy thermodynamics;joint quantum entropy;configuration entropy;entropy in thermodynamics and information theory;maximum entropy spectral estimation;entropy rate;conditional entropy;min entropy;statistics;entropy;sample entropy	Robotics	45.58870663676688	14.624669325857145	145799

The estimation, based on the generalized least squares criterion, is both consistent and asymptotically efficient. The detection is performed via the minimum description length (MDL) principle and is proved to be consistent.

Some recommend using only inverse transform method when using CRN, suggesting that this strategy yields the best result, i.e., the highest degree of variance reduction. In this paper, we derive conditions guaranteeing variance reduction for a special class of systems-generalized semi-Markov processes (GSMP) with exponential clock samples-when using CRN and when the clock samples are generated via a version of the acceptance-rejection method. Our preliminary experimental results show that the variance reduction under this construction may be higher, sometimes significantly, than when inverse transform method is used.	horner's method;inverse transform sampling;rejection sampling;semiconductor industry;simulation;time complexity;variance reduction	Pirooz Vakili	1995		10.1145/224401.224615	random variable;econometrics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;statistics	EDA	45.19303656856766	7.371986111224536	146762

As a modeling framework, they differ from the traditional approaches based on ODEs and CTMCs in two fundamental aspects: their qualitative character and the non-permanency of resources. In this article we introduce to reaction systems several notions of central interest in biomodeling: mass conservation, invariants, steady states, stationary processes, elementary fluxes, and periodicity. We prove that the decision problems related to these properties span a number of complexity classes from P to NP- and coNP-complete to PSPACE-complete.	academy;boolean algebra;complex dynamics;complexity class;computational complexity theory;fixed point (mathematics);linear algebra;logical connective;marian petre;model checking;open dynamics engine;pspace;pspace-complete;petri net;quasiperiodicity;stationary process;steady state;temporal logic	Sepinoud Azimi;Cristian Gratie;Sergiu Ivanov;Luca Manzoni;Ion Petre;Antonio E.

88834aecdbd50beba4a7af161ba73410b6bf242b	existence and uniqueness of a quasistationary distribution for markov processes with fast return from infinity		We study the long-time behaviour of a Markov process evolving in N and conditioned not to hit 0. Assuming that the process comes back quickly from ∞, we prove that the process admits a unique quasistationary distribution (in particular, the distribution of the conditioned process admits a limit when time goes to ∞). Moreover, we prove that the distribution of the process converges exponentially fast in the total variation norm to its quasistationary distribution and we provide a bound for the rate of convergence. As a first application of our result, we bring a new insight on the speed of convergence to the quasistationary distribution for birth-and-death processes: we prove that starting from any initial distribution the conditional probability converges in law to a unique distribution ρ supported in N∗ if and only if the process has a unique quasistationary distribution. Moreover, ρ is this unique quasistationary distribution and the convergence is shown to be exponentially fast in the total variation norm. Also, considering the lack of results on quasistationary distributions for nonirreducible processes on countable spaces, we show, as a second application of our result, the existence and uniqueness of a quasistationary distribution for a class of possibly nonirreducible processes.	markov property;rate of convergence	Servet Martínez;Jaime San Martín;Denis Villemonais	2014	J.

8fc26f352df86bb5dfedc5acc920e7616b0294c6	the number of symbol comparisons in quicksort and quickselect	markov source;probabilistic model;analytical method;binary search	We revisit the classical QuickSort and QuickSelect algorithms, under a complexity model that fully takes into account the elementary comparisons between symbols composing the records to be processed. Our probabilistic models belong to a broad category of information sources that encompasses memoryless (i.e., independent-symbols) and Markov sources, as well as many unbounded-correlation sources. We establish that, under our conditions, the average-case complexity of QuickSort is O(n log n) [rather than O(n log n), classically], whereas that of QuickSelect remains O(n). Explicit expressions for the implied constants are provided by our combinatorial–analytic methods. Introduction. Every student of a basic algorithms course is taught that, on average, the complexity of Quicksort is O(n log n), that of binary search is O(log n), and that of radix-exchange sort is O(n log n); see for instance [13,16]. Such statements are based on specific assumptions—that the comparison of data items (for the first two) and the comparison of symbols (for the third one) have unit cost—and they have the obvious merit of offering an easy-to-grasp picture of the complexity landscape. However, as noted by Sedgewick, these simplifying assumptions suffer from limitations: they do not make possible a precise assessment of the relative merits of algorithms and data structures that resort to different methods (e.g., comparison-based versus radix-based sorting) in a way that would satisfy the requirements of either information theory or algorithms engineering. Indeed, computation is not reduced to its simplest terms, namely, the manipulation of totally elementary symbols, such as bits, bytes, characters. Furthermore, such simplified analyses say little about a great many application contexts, in databases or natural language processing, for instance, where information is highly “non-atomic”, in the sense that it does not plainly reduce to a single machine word. First, we observe that, for commonly used data models, the mean costs Sn and Kn of any algorithm under the symbol-comparison and the key-comparison model, respectively, are connected by the universal relation Sn = Kn ·O(log n). (This results from the fact that at most O(log n) symbols suffice, with high probability, to distinguish n keys; cf. the analysis of the height of digital trees, ICALP 2009, to appear --1 --also known as “tries”, in [3].) The surprise is that there are cases where this upper bound is tight, as in QuickSort; others where both costs are of the same order, as in QuickSelect. In this work, we show that the expected cost of QuickSort is O(n log n), not O(n log n), when all elementary operations— symbol comparisons—are taken into account. By contrast, the cost of QuickSelect turns out to be O(n), in both the old and the new world, albeit, of course, with different implied constants. Our results constitute broad extensions of earlier ones by Fill and Janson (Quicksort, [7]) and Fill and Nakama (QuickSelect, [8]). The sources that we deal with include memoryless (“Bernoulli”) sources with possibly non-uniform independent symbols and Markov sources, as well as many non-Markovian sources with unbounded memory from the past. A central idea is the modelling of the source via its fundamental probabilities, namely the probabilities that a word of the source begins with a given prefix. Our approach otherwise relies on methods from analytic combinatorics [10], as well as on information theory and the theory of dynamical systems. It relates to earlier analyses of digital trees (“tries”) by Clément, Flajolet, and Vallée [3,19]. Results. We consider a totally ordered alphabet Σ. What we call a probabilistic source produces infinite words on the alphabet Σ (see Definition 1). The set of keys (words, data items) is then Σ∞, endowed with the strict lexicographic order denoted ‘≺’. Our main objects of study are two algorithms, applied to n keys assumed to be independently drawn from the same source S, namely, the standard sorting algorithm QuickSort(n) and the algorithm QuickSelect(m,n), which selects the mth smallest element. In the latter case, we shall mostly focus our attention on situations where the rank m is proportional to n, being of the form m = αn, so that the algorithm determines the αth quantile; it will then be denoted by QuickQuantα(n). We also consider the cases where rank m equals 1 (which we call QuickMin), equals n (QuickMax), or is randomly chosen in {1, . . . , n} (QuickRand). Our main results involve constants that depend on the source S (and possibly on the real α); these are displayed in Figures 1–3 and described in Section 1. They specialize nicely for a binary source B (under which keys are compared via their binary expansions, with uniform independent bits), in which case they admit pleasant expressions that simplify and extend those of Fill and Nakama [8] and Grabner and Prodinger [11] and lend themselves to precise numerical evaluations (Figure 2). The conditions Λ–tamed, Π–tamed, and “periodic” are made explicit in Subsection 2.1. Conditions of applicability to classical source models are discussed in Section 3. Theorem 1. (i) For a Λ–tamed source S, the mean number Tn of symbol comparisons of QuickSort(n) involves the entropy h(S) of the source: Tn = 1 h(S) n log n+a(S) n log n+b(S) n+o(n), for some a(S), b(S) ∈ R. (1) (ii) For a periodic source, a term nP (log n) is to be added to the estimate (1), where P (u) is a (computable) continuous periodic function. ICALP 2009, to appear --2 --Theorem 2. For a Π–tamed source S, one has the following, with δ = δ(S) > 0. (i) The mean number of symbol comparisons Q n for QuickQuantα satisfies Q n = ρS(α)n + O(n 1−δ). (2) (ii) The mean number of symbol comparisons, M (−) n for QuickMin (n) and M (+) n for QuickMax(n), satisfies with = ±, M ( ) n = ρ ( ) S n + O(n 1−δ), with ρ S = ρS(1), ρ (−) S = ρS(0). (3) (iii) The mean number Mn of symbol comparisons performed by QuickRand(n) satisfies Mn = γS n + O(n1−δ), with γS = ∫ 1	average-case complexity;bernoulli polynomials;best, worst and average case;binary search algorithm;bubble sort;byte;computable function;computation;data model;data structure;database;dynamical system;icalp;information theory;lexicographical order;markov chain;natural language processing;numerical analysis;quickselect;quicksort;randomness;requirement;sorting algorithm;with high probability	Brigitte Vallée;Julien Clément;James Allen Fill;Philippe Flajolet	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02927-1_62	statistical model;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;hybrid algorithm;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm;statistics;binary search algorithm;introsort	Theory	44.26946447545737	17.573430141748425	148077

The data recorded on such an array present the so-called “multiple invariances,” which can be linked to the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) model. CP refers to a family of low-rank decompositions of three-way or higher way (mutidimensional) data arrays, where each dimension is termed as a “mode.” A sufficient condition is derived for uniqueness of the CP decomposition of a three-way (three mode) array in the particular case where one of the three loading matrices, each associated to one mode, involved in the decomposition has full column rank. Based on this, upper bounds on the maximal number of identifiable DOAs are deduced for the two typical cases, i.e., the general case of uncorrelated or partially correlated sources and the case where the sources are coherent.	coherence (physics);direction of arrival;maximal set;sensor	Xijing Guo;Sebastian Miron;David Brie;Shihua Zhu;Xuewen Liao	2011	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2011.2131134	data modeling;econometrics;identifiability;data model;polarization;computer science;partial correlation;invariant;signal processing;mathematics;stress;upper and lower bounds;estimation theory;matrix decomposition;sensor array;statistics;detection theory	Visualization	53.47535140325058	9.390852253350312	148555

However, for pattern recognition, since pattern vectors are often normalized by their norm, they are on a hyper-spherical surface. Therefore, we have to study a normal distribution in a non-Euclidean space. Here, we provide the new concept of geometrically local isotropic independence and define the Maxwell normal distribution in a manifold. We also define the Mahalanobis metric, which is an extension of the Mahalanobis distance in Euclidean space. We provide the Mahalanobis metric equation, which is covariant with coordinate transformation. Furthermore, we show its experimental results.	maxwell (microarchitecture)	Yukihiko Yamashita;Mariko Numakami;Naoya Inoue	2006		10.1007/11815921_66	normal distribution;statistical manifold;topology;metric;fisher information metric;mahalanobis distance;calculus;euclidean distance;mathematics;geometry;statistics	ECom	45.66120813012496	13.448701496008612	149120

It has been previously shown that within the nonparametric candidate family of all i.i.d. (or, more generally, Markov) distributions, the optimized exponentially twisted distribution is the unique asymptotically optimal sampling distribution. As n to infinity , the sampling cost required to stabilize the normalized variance grows with strictly positive exponential rate for any suboptimal sampling distribution, while this sampling cost for the optimal exponentially twisted distribution is only O(n/sup 1/2/). Here, it is established that the optimality is actually much stronger. As n to infinity , this solution simultaneously stabilizes all error moments of both the sample mean and the sample variance estimators with sampling cost O(n/sup 1/2/). In addition, it is shown that the embedded parametric family of exponentially twisted distributions has a certain uniform asymptotic stability property. The technique is stable even if the optimal twisting parameter(s) cannot be precisely determined. >	monte carlo method;time complexity	John S. Sadowsky	1993	IEEE Trans.

Motivated by recent applications that suggest use of nonuniform antenna arrays, a generalized theory of clutter rank is derived and demonstrated. First, a one-dimensional effective random process is defined by projecting the measurements obtained by an arbitrary space-time radar system into an equivalent one-dimensional sampling structure. Then, this projection and the Karhunen-Loeve representation of random processes are used to predict clutter rank based on effective aperture-bandwidth product. Simulated results are used to confirm the theory over a wide range of scenarios, and along the way, the well-known Brennan's rule for clutter rank is shown to be a special case of the proposed aperture-bandwidth product	clutter;low-rank approximation;moving target indication;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;radar;rank (j programming language);rejection sampling;sampling (signal processing);space-time adaptive processing;stochastic process;the matrix;whole earth 'lectronic link	Nathan A.

The zeta function is an important example of this class of functions, since it encodes inclusion on the lattice by indicating whether one lattice element includes another. This indicator function can be generalized to quantify a degree of inclusion, which induces a measure on the lattice. In the past we have shown that for distributive lattices in general, these degrees of inclusion follow a sum rule, a product rule and a Bayes' theorem analog. When such a generalization is applied to a lattice of logical statements, we recover Bayesian probability theory. In this paper, we review our previous work in developing the lattice of questions from the lattice of logical statements which answer them. With the aid of a single postulate relating probabilities of statements to relevances of questions, we derive a natural generalization of information theory. The result is a novel and efficient derivation of Shannon's entropy based on lattice theory.	assertion (software development);boolean algebra;computation;crystal structure;entropy (information theory);http 404;information theory;irreducibility;relevance;retrospect (software);shannon (unit);sum rule in quantum mechanics	Kevin H.

We propose a risk measure to characterize systemic events of the dynamic network, based on quantile functions theory. We provide explicit calculations or estimates for our consensus dynamic both in transient and steady-state dynamics. Our analysis highlights the dependence of risk on the spectral properties of the communication graph and the delay of the network. Unlike consensus networks with no delay, the risk measure exhibits a non-monotonic behavior in presence of time-delay. This non-monotonicity is the origin of potential aggregate fluctuation which is an undesirable systemic event of our network.	aggregate data;aggregate function;non-monotonic logic;quantum fluctuation;risk measure;semantic network;steady state	Christoforos Somarakis;Yaser Ghaedsharaf;Nader Motee	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963304	risk measure;econometrics;robustness (computer science);control theory;quantile;dynamic network analysis;noise measurement;random variable;stochastic process;mathematics;systemic risk	EDA	43.560050305683134	7.679280239569016	149827

The optimization relies on the Fisher information matrix (FIM). A closed-form expression of the FIM determinant is obtained for 2-D and 3-D spaces, considering heterogeneous sensors and distance-dependent ranging errors. Analytical bounds on the FIM determinant are derived, and several optimal landmark placement expressions for specific scenarios using two groups of landmarks are given. A minimax formulation for the optimal landmark placement is proposed and iteratively solved using exponential smoothing. There are several key features integrated into the proposed approach. These include 1) averaging of the cost function over elementary regions of the AGV search space to include the effect of the whole search space, 2) using a projected gradient search to stay within the boundaries of the landmark search space, and 3) searching on a convex space for placing the landmarks. Convergence issues of the proposed algorithm are discussed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed optimal landmark placement enables accurate AGV localization over significantly large volume or area of the search space compared with the case when landmarks are randomly placed.	algorithm;autonomous robot;convex set;fisher information;gradient;loss function;mathematical optimization;minimax;numerical method;randomness;sensor;slater determinant;smoothing;time complexity	Javier Perez-Ramirez;Deva K.

This question is triggering a great quantity of works in the frontier of physics, biology, mathematics and computer science. Even more when this century has been told to be the century of complexity (Hawking, 2000). Although there seems to be no urgency to answer the above question, many different proposals that have been developed to this respect can be found in the literature (Perakh, 2004). In this context, several articles concerning statistical complexity and stochastic processes are collected in this chapter. Complex patterns generated by the time evolution of a one-dimensional digitalized coupled map lattice are quantitatively analyzed in Section 2. A method for discerning complexity among the different patterns is implemented. The quantitative results indicate two zones in parameter space where the dynamics shows the most complex patterns. These zones are located on the two edges of an absorbent region where the system displays spatio-temporal intermittency. The synchronization of two stochastically coupled one-dimensional cellular automata (CA) is analyzed in Section 3. It is shown that the transition to synchronization is characterized by a dramatic increase of the statistical complexity of the patterns generated by the difference automaton. This singular behavior is verified to be present in several CA rules displaying complex behavior. In Sections 4 and 5, we are concerned with the stability analysis of patterns in extended systems. In general, it has been revealed to be a difficult task. The many nonlinearly interacting degrees of freedom can destabilize the system by adding small perturbations to some of them. The impossibility to control all those degrees of freedom finally drives the dynamics toward a complex spatio-temporal evolution. Hence, it is of a great interest to develop techniques able to compel the dynamics toward a particular kind of structure. The application of such techniques forces the system to approach the stable manifold of the required pattern, and then the dynamics finally decays to that target pattern. 4	cellular automaton;complexity;computer science;coupled map lattice;stochastic process	Ricardo López-Ruiz;Juan R.

In the case of models defined on random graphs of size N we confirm the original expectation that CA[k], the approximation of order k, yields estimates with an error of order O(1/N) with polynomial computational complexity proportional to N. We discuss the relation between this approach and some recent developments in the field. Introduction. – The Bethe approximation (BA) is one of the major ingredients leading to the important advances in combinatorial optimisation made by the statistical physics community in recent years. The starting point of this line of research can be traced back to a) the inclusion the Replica-Symmetry-Breaking (RSB) scheme in the context of the Bethe approximation [1,2] and b) the application of the method to single instances [3]. On the other hand the Bethe approximation has become a key issue in the context of information theory after it was recognized that the well known Belief-Propagation (BP) algorithm is tightly related to it [4]. This algorithm was introduced in the context of Bayesian networks and has gained interest after the discovery that the fast decoding of Turbo codes and Gallagher codes is indeed an instance of BP [5]. Currenlty the problem of computing the corrections to the BA is attracting incresing attention (see [6–8] for recent literature,) not only for the applications mentioned above but also because the BA is the only way of obtaining a mean-field like solution to many unsolved physical problems, notably Anderson localization. In this work we numerically investigate the Cavity Approximation (CA), a tool recently introduced in [6] to study graphical models. The CA is a sequence of approximations defined iteratively such that the BA corresponds to the zero-th order. Its main features are: i) it can be implemented on a given sample (much as the Bethe approximation and at variance with the Replica method), therefore to each approximation corresponds a BP-like algorithm; ii) the expansion at order k (CA[k]) is correct on graphs with k loops, much as the Bethe approximation is correct on trees; iii) the computational complexity of the corresponding algorithm grows as N; iv) when averaged over the samples the CA reproduces the results of the Replica method, indeed it corresponds to computing the 1/N corrections within the cavity method. In [6] it was argued that the CA is the natural approximation scheme on locally tree-like structures, in the sense that CA[k] yields the O(1/N) corrections for models defined	algorithm;approximation;backpropagation;bayesian network;belief propagation;business architecture;combinatorial optimization;computational complexity theory;emoticon;graphical model;information theory;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;polynomial;random graph;single-instance storage;turbo code;whole earth 'lectronic link	Tommaso Rizzo;Bastian Wemmenhove;Hilbert J.

In this paper, the conventional Gibbs sampling algorithm is demonstrated to be geometrically ergodic in tackling with lattice Gaussian sampling, which means its induced Markov chain converges exponentially fast to the stationary distribution. Moreover, as the exponential convergence rate is dominated by the spectral radius of the forward operator of the Markov chain, a comprehensive analysis is given and we show that the convergence performance can be further enhanced by usages of blocked sampling strategy and choices of selection probabilities.	computer programming;cryptography;ergodicity;gibbs algorithm;gibbs sampling;markov chain;monte carlo method;rate of convergence;stationary process;time complexity	Zheng Wang;Cong Ling	2017	2017 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)	10.1109/ITW.2017.8278001	mathematical optimization;ergodicity;rate of convergence;discrete mathematics;stationary distribution;sampling (statistics);gibbs algorithm;computer science;markov chain monte carlo;markov chain;gibbs sampling	ML	42.61675424865133	13.649721842970493	150196

We design efficient algorithms to verify the sufficient condition for unique <i>ℓ</i><sub>1</sub> sparse recovery. One of our algorithms produces comparable results with the state-of-the-art technique and performs orders of magnitude faster. We show that the <i>ℓ</i><sub>1</sub> -constrained minimal singular value (<i>ℓ</i><sub>1</sub>-CMSV) of the measurement matrix determines, in a very concise manner, the recovery performance of <i>ℓ</i><sub>1</sub>-based algorithms such as the Basis Pursuit, the Dantzig selector, and the LASSO estimator. Compared to performance analysis involving the Restricted Isometry Constant, the arguments in this paper are much less complicated and provide more intuition on the stability of sparse signal recovery. We show also that, with high probability, the subgaussian ensemble generates measurement matrices with <i>ℓ</i><sub>1</sub>-CMSVs bounded away from zero, as long as the number of measurements is relatively large. To compute the <i>ℓ</i><sub>1</sub>-CMSV and its lower bound, we design two algorithms based on the interior point algorithm and the semidefinite relaxation.	algorithm;basis pursuit;compressed sensing;detection theory;ensemble kalman filter;interior point method;lagrangian relaxation;least squares;linear programming relaxation;profiling (computer programming);restricted isometry property;signal reconstruction;sparse matrix;with high probability	Gongguo Tang;Arye Nehorai	2011	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2011.2164913	signal reconstruction;algorithm design;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;basis pursuit;index term;sparse matrix;interior point method;restricted isometry property;probability;gaussian process;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;singular value;statistics	Metrics	48.98257493286669	8.186273189506506	150403

This creates the problem of searching for a target in a coloured noise and interference environment. Traditional space–time adaptive processing (STAP) deals with the problem by using target-free training data to study this environment and build its characteristic covariance matrix. The maximum likelihood estimation detector (MLED) and its generalised counterpart (GMLED) are two reduced-rank STAP algorithms that eliminate the need for training data when mapping the statistics of the background interference. In this work the MLED and GMLED solutions to a multistatic scenario are derived. A hybrid multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system where each receiver is a coherent STAP radar has been employed. The focus of the work is the spatial diversity provided by the wide separation of the individual transmitter and receiver platforms. It is proven that this configuration does not affect the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) property of the bistatic radar case. A Gaussian approximation to the statistics of the multistatic algorithms is derived in order to provide a more in-depth analysis. The viability of the theoretical models and their approximations are tested against a numerical simulation. & 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As a main result, we present a quite general formulation for estimating the joint probability distribution of the random elements of a set of AGs, in which some degree of probabilistic independence between random elements is assumed, by considering only 2nd-order joint probabilities and marginal ones. We show that the two previously proposed approaches based on the random-graph representation (First-Order Random Graphs (FORGs) and Function-Described Graphs (FDGs)) can be seen as two different approximations of the general formulation presented. From this new representation, it is easy to derive that whereas FORGs contain some more semantic (partial) 2nd-order information, FDGs contain more structural 2nd-order information of the whole set of AGs. Most importantly, the presented formulation opens the door to the development of new and more powerful probabilistic representations of sets of AGs based on the 2nd- order random graph concept.	random graph;vertex (geometry)	Francesc Serratosa;René Alquézar;Alberto Sanfeliu	2002		10.1007/3-540-70659-3_26	probability distribution;random regular graph;random graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;graph theory;mathematics;statistics	Theory	39.57211768925919	15.39764919792073	150520

Jensen-Bregman divergences unify the squared Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances with the celebrated information-theoretic JensenShannon divergence, and can further be skewed to include Bregman divergences in limit cases. We study the geometric properties and combinatorial complexities of both the Voronoi diagrams and the centroidal Voronoi diagrams induced by such as class of divergences. We show that Jensen-Bregman divergences occur in two contexts: (1) when symmetrizing Bregman divergences, and (2) when computing the Bhattacharyya distances of statistical distributions. Since the Bhattacharyya distance of popular parametric exponential family distributions in statistics can be computed equivalently as Jensen-Bregman divergences, these skew Jensen-Bregman Voronoi diagrams allow one to define a novel family of statistical Voronoi diagrams.	bregman divergence;convex function;distortion;information theory;jensen's inequality;time complexity;voronoi diagram	Frank Nielsen;Richard Nock	2011	Trans.

Players' types evolve as independent, controlled linear Gaussian processes and players incur quadratic instantaneous costs. This forms a dynamic linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) game with asymmetric information. We show that under certain conditions, players' strategies that are linear in their private types, together with Gaussian beliefs form a perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) of the game. Furthermore, it is shown that this is a signaling equilibrium due to the fact that future beliefs on players' types are affected by the equilibrium strategies. We provide a backward-forward algorithm to find the PBE. Each step of the backward algorithm reduces to solving an algebraic matrix equation for every possible realization of the state estimate covariance matrix. The forward algorithm consists of Kalman filter recursions, where state estimate covariance matrices depend on equilibrium strategies.	forward algorithm;gaussian process;kalman filter;linear algebra;nash equilibrium;recursion	Deepanshu Vasal;Achilleas Anastasopoulos	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7799332	random variable;games;mathematical optimization;simulation;sequential equilibrium;mathematical model;mathematics;mathematical economics;outcome;equilibrium selection;statistics	Robotics	40.166177822110974	4.819603778517708	151170

This ambiguity generally can be resolved by pumping extra information into the system. A classical estimation problem is the obtained at the expense of reduced autonomy of the estimator due to the demand for external information not inherent to the system. The interval Lambda of the unambiguous estimates can be considerably extended using observations of several different wavelengths lambda /sub i/. This yields Lambda as the least common multiple of all lambda /sub i/. A method of developing optimum estimation rules for this case is introduced. Optimum estimation rules for some typical cases with Gaussian observation errors are also developed. >		Ivan Vrana	1993	IEEE Trans.

665e4f852b45f7a0872ebc825985c166abdb9c76	quantum computing with classical bits		A bit-quantum map relates probabilistic information for Ising spins or classical bits to quantum spins or qubits. Quantum systems are subsystems of classical statistical systems. The Ising spins can represent macroscopic two-level observables, and the quantum subsystem employs suitable expectation values and correlations. We discuss static memory materials based on Ising spins for which boundary information can be transported in the generalized equilibrium state. They can realize quantum operations as the Hadamard or CNOT-gate for the quantum subsystem. Classical probabilistic systems can account for the entanglement of quantum spins. An arbitrary unitary evolution for an arbitrary number of quantum spins can be described by static memory materials for an infinite number of Ising spins. We discuss discrete subsets of unitary operations realized by a finite number of Ising spins. They may be useful for new computational structures. We suggest that features of quantum computation or more general probabilistic computation may be realized by neural networks, neuromorphic computing or perhaps even the brain. This does neither require small isolated entities nor very low temperature. In these systems the processing of probabilistic information can be more general than for static memory materials. We propose a general formalism for probabilistic computing for which deterministic computing and quantum computing are special limiting cases.		C.

In particular they provide powerful analysis tools for digital communications, computer networks and flexible manufacturing systems. For most practical systems the underlying Markov chain possesses a prohibitively large number of states. This necessitates state aggregation in an effort to maintain the computational complexity at manageable levels. In this paper we consider the aggregation of an underlying Markov chain for a parallel synchronized structure in a closed network. Such Markov chains are encountered in the modelling of computer networks and manufacturing systems, and do not have closed-form solutions, requiring numerical computation. Based on an asymptotic convergence result we provide a parametric convergence analysis of the transition rates of the aggregated Markov chain and develop reduced complexity solutions.	computation;computational complexity theory;markov chain;numerical analysis;numerical method;stationary process;statistical signal processing;system identification	Kutluyil Dogançay	2010	2010 18th European Signal Processing Conference		markov decision process;markov chain;maximum-entropy markov model;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;distributed computing;markov algorithm;markov process;markov model;hidden markov model;variable-order markov model	ML	44.47379945336379	8.573544052514409	152570

We conjecture that the second largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix is bounded above by (1 + 1/n)(1 − 2/n) with equality when the poset is disconnected. This Markov chain provides a way to sample the linear extensions of the poset with a relaxation time bounded above by n2/(n + 2) and a mixing time of O(n2log n). We conjecture that the mixing time is in fact O(nlog n) as for the usual random-to-random shuffling.		Arvind Ayyer;Anne Schilling;Nicolas M.

The method is to develop upper and lower bounds that are a function of the maximum dimension of the linear subspaces spanned by the Gaussian mixture components. The method not only reveals the existence or absence of a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) error floor (phase transition) but also provides insight into the MMSE decay via multivariate generalizations of the MMSE dimension and the MMSE power offset, which are a function of the interaction between the geometrical properties of the kernel and the Gaussian mixture. These results apply not only to standard linear random Gaussian measurements but also to linear kernels that minimize the MMSE. It is shown that optimal kernels do not change the number of measurements associated with the MMSE phase transition, rather they affect the sensed power required to achieve a target MMSE in the low-noise regime. Overall, our bounds are tighter and sharper than standard bounds on the minimum number of measurements needed to recover sparse signals associated with a union of subspaces model, as they are not asymptotic in the signal dimension or signal sparsity.	error floor;mean squared error;mixture model;sparse matrix;weak measurement	Francesco Renna;A.

The robustness of simple limiter detectors is discussed. The extension of the concept of a suboptimum detector to an adaptive detector for operating in an unknown noise environment is also discussed.		Ning Hsing Lu;Bruce A. Eisenstein	1983	IEEE Trans.

We consider a situation where the environment is not homogeneous, i.e., when the covariance matrices of the primary and the secondary data are different. A knowledge-aided Bayesian framework is proposed, where these covariance matrices are considered as random, and some information about the covariance matrix of the training samples is available. Within this framework, the maximum a priori (MAP) estimate of the primary data covariance matrix is derived. It is shown that it amounts to colored loading of the sample covariance matrix of the secondary data. The MAP estimate is in turn used to yield a Bayesian version of the adaptive matched filter.

d68e7868019a0455365b4d4cc80245108653aac7	reversible computation		We develop a notion of stochastic rewriting over marked graphs – i.e. directed multigraphs with degree constraints. The approach is based on double-pushout (DPO) graph rewriting. Marked graphs are expressive enough to internalize the ‘no-dangling-edge’ condition inherent in DPO rewriting. Our main result is that the linear span of marked graph occurrence-counting functions – or motif functions – form an algebra which is closed under the infinitesimal generator of (the Markov chain associated with) any such rewriting system. This gives a general procedure to derive the moment semantics of any such rewriting system, as a countable (and recursively enumerable) system of differential equations indexed by motif functions. The differential system describes the time evolution of moments (of any order) of these motif functions under the rewriting system. We illustrate the semantics using the example of preferential attachment networks; a well-studied complex system, which meshes well with our notion of marked graph rewriting. We show how in this case our procedure obtains a finite description of all moments of degree counts for a fixed degree.	attachments;complex system;computation;graph rewriting;marked graph;markov chain;motif;multigraph;recursively enumerable set;reversible computing	John C.

Singularity (i.e., very poor estimation accuracy) occurs in this problem if objects are very close to each other.

The noise in the discrete time case is assumed to be generated by another CSM. For the continuous time case only Gaussian white noise, or a single state CSM noise, is considered. In both cases, the mmse is decomposed into the mmse of the estimator which is informed of the exact states of the signal and noise, and an additional error term. This term is tightly upper and lower bounded. The bounds for the discrete time signals are developed using distribution tilting and Shannon’s lower bound on the probability of a random variable to exceed a given threshold. The analysis for the continuous time signals is performed using Duncan’s theorem. The bounds in this case are developed by applying the data processing theorem to sampled versions of the state process and its estimate, and by using Fano’s inequality. The bounds in both cases are explicitly calculated for CSM’s with Gaussian subsources. For causal estimation, these bounds approach zero harmonically as the duration of the observed signals approaches infinity.	additive white gaussian noise;causal filter;community climate system model;fano's inequality;open-source software;shannon (unit);social inequality;unified extensible firmware interface;utility functions on indivisible goods;white noise	Yariv Ephraim;Neri Merhav	1992	IEEE Trans.

0373b8c657304d62b332550005bad604aa9dbcfa	conditional characteristic functions of molchan-golosov fractional lévy processes with application to credit risk		Molchan-Golosov fractional Lévy processes (MG-fLps) are introduced by a multivariate componentwise Molchan-Golosov transformation based on an n-dimensional driving Lévy process. Using results of fractional calculus and infinitely divisible distributions we are able to calculate the conditional characteristic function of integrals driven by MG-fLps. This leads to important prediction results including the case of multivariate fractional Brownian motion, fractional subordinators or general fractional stochastic differential equations. Examples are the fractional Lévy Ornstein-Uhlenbeck or Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model. As an application we present a fractional credit model with a long range dependent hazard rate and calculate bond prices.

The Neyman—Pearson detector can be derived and yields the well-known CUSUM algorithm, when the abrupt change is contaminated by an additive noise. However, a multiplicative noise has been observed in many signal processing applications. These applications include radar, sonar, communication and image processing. This paper addresses the problem of abrupt change detection in presence of multiplicative noise. The optimal Neyman—Pearson detector is studied when the abrupt change and noise parameters are known. The parameters are unknown in most practical applications and have to be estimated. The maximum likelihood estimator is then derived for these parameters. The Neyman—Pearson detector combined with the maximum likelihood estimator yields the generalized likelihood ratio detector.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;anomaly detection;colors of noise;expectation–maximization algorithm;image noise;image processing;kadir–brady saliency detector;mathematical optimization;multiplicative noise;new product development;numerical analysis;quantum decoherence;radar;sonar (symantec);sensor;signal processing;utility functions on indivisible goods;white noise;whole earth 'lectronic link	Jean-Yves Tourneret	1998	Signal Processing	10.1016/S0165-1684(98)00076-0	econometrics;speech recognition;image processing;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;maximum likelihood;estimation theory;statistics	ML	51.870490087756444	12.175063916870588	155971

5c866dd21a08b4d6234ebccab5582380df0481c1	quantum computation via sparse distributed representation	sparse distributed representations;superposition probability amplitude localist;quantum computing	"""Quantum superposition states that any physical system simultaneously exists in all of its possible states, the number of which is exponential in the number of entities composing the system. The strength of presence of each possible state in the superposition—i.e., the probability with which it would be observed if measured—is represented by its probability amplitude coefficient. The assumption that these coefficients must be represented physically disjointly from each other, i.e., localistically, is nearly universal in the quantum theory/computing literature. Alternatively, these coefficients can be represented using sparse distributed representations (SDR), wherein each coefficient is represented by a small subset of an overall population of representational units and the subsets can overlap. Specifically, I consider an SDR model in which the overall population consists of Q clusters, each having K binary units, so that each coefficient is represented by a set of Q units, one per cluster. Thus, KQ coefficients can be represented with KQ units. We can then consider the particular world state, X, whose coefficient’s representation, R(X), is the set of Q units active at time t to have the maximal probability and the probabilities of all other states, Y, to correspond to the size of the intersection of R(Y) and R(X). Thus, R(X) simultaneously serves both as the representation of the particular state, X, and as a probability distribution over all states. Thus, set intersection may be used to classically implement quantum superposition. If algorithms exist for which the time it takes to store (learn) new representations and to find the closest-matching stored representation (probabilistic inference) remains constant as additional representations are stored, this would meet the criterion of quantum computing. Such algorithms, based on SDR, have already been described. They achieve this """"quantum speed-up"""" with no new esoteric technology, and in fact, on a single-processor, classical (Von Neumann) computer."""	algorithm;artificial neural network;c date and time functions;coefficient;computation;etsi satellite digital radio;entity;maximal set;probability amplitude;quantum computing;quantum mechanics;quantum superposition;sparse matrix;time complexity;von neumann architecture	Gerard J.

One can easily derive that the structure of the solution joint distribution is that of a graphical model. The potential functions are then marginals at some power. We address the following question, Under which conditions on the set of constraints is it possible to fully identify the canonical exponents in the maximum entropy solution as functions of the problem structure? Literature related to this topic is somewhat scattered in disciplines such as statistical mechanics, information theory, graph theory, and inference in graphical models. In this article we gather and link results from these different fields. From this, we show that for a particular class of constraints set on marginals, the chordal maximal coherent sets of constraints, it is possible to derive the canonical exponents of the graphical model solution of the maximum entropy problem as the numbers of occurrences of separators in an associated join tree. Conversely, we present sufficient conditions to ensure that a graphical model is a solution of a maximum entropy problem.	graphical model	Alain Franc;M. Goulard;Nathalie Peyrard	2010	SIAM J.

He introduced a combinatorial notion of entropy and information I(x : y) conveyed by a binary string x about the unknown value of a variable y. The current paper poses the following questions: what is the relationship between the information conveyed by x about y to the description complexity of x ? is there a notion of cost of information ? are there limits on how efficient x conveys information ? To answer these questions Kolmogorov’s definition is extended and a new concept termed information width which is similar to n-widths in approximation theory is introduced. Information of any input source, e.g., samplebased, general side-information or a hybrid of both can be evaluated by a single common formula. An application to the space of binary functions is considered.	algorithm;approximation theory;entropy (information theory);information;shannon (unit)	Joel Ratsaby	2007	CoRR			Theory	44.517572935374176	17.551457314363425	156598

In the proposed method, the 2-D DOAs of noncoherent and coherent signals are estimated separately, while the difficulties such as the separation of the noncoherent and coherent signals and the automatic pairing of the azimuth and elevation angles of same signal are overcame. Furthermore for overcoming the “saturation” problem encountered in estimation of coherent signals, an iterative alternate scheme is presented.

However, few of them concerned about the effectiveness of reconstruction. In this paper, a novel beamformer is proposed, which introduces the improve factor (IF) to evaluate the improvement scale of output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) with and without reconstruction. By exploiting the relationship between the IF and input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), it can be made a trade off between the extent of the performance improved and computational load that reconstruction required. Therefore, the SV is estimated at first, and then the level of SNR determines whether the INC matrix is required to reconstruct. During the implementation, a spherical uncertainty set and the sparsity of interference direction are used. Simulation results indicate that the proposed beamformer has better performance compared with existing adaptive beamforming algorithms. HighlightsThe beamformer based on joint estimation is investigated.The relationship between the improve factor (IF) and SNR is exploited.The novel beamformer based the effectiveness of reconstruction is proposed.	adaptive beamformer;beamforming	Yuping Zhang;Yunjie Li;Meiguo Gao	2016	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2015.09.039	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;speech recognition;engineering;adaptive beamformer	Vision	51.35342084587778	7.827442465944902	156773

However, in many applications, data streams containing the A's and B's will often have different sampling rates or will be asynchronous. For these reasons and the fact that each stream may contain gaps in information, methods that require minimal a priori knowledge of the correspondence between A's and B's would be superior to the existing algorithms that require exact correspondence. We present an information-theoretic algorithm for recovering X from a set of A's and a set of B's that does not require a priori knowledge of correspondences. The algorithm views the problem in terms of distributions on the group SE(3), and minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of these distributions with respect to the unknown X. This minimization is performed by an efficient numerical procedure that reliably recovers an unknown X.	algorithm;batch processing;dirac delta function;experiment;information theory;kullback–leibler divergence;microsoft dynamics ax;numerical analysis;sampling (signal processing);sensor;simulation	Martin Kendal Ackerman;Alexis Cheng;Gregory S.

If a machine is required to solve such a problem on a number of occasions, it is possible to take advantage of this repetition. One can design a machine that will extract more and more of the pertinent information about these unknown parameters as it recognizes the patterns and readjusts itself to be more selective to them; the machine improves in per formance as it gains exper ience on the problem. This paper presents a model suitable for many such problems and evolves a solution in the form of a machine that LLlearns7’ to solve the problem without external aid. Such machines are said to “learn without a teacher.” The Bayes solution to the model problem requires the computat ion of the a posteriori probability density of the unknown parameters. A recursive equat ion for this density is derived. This equation describes the structure of a relatively simple system of finite size that may be realized in a delay-feedback form. The application of the model and the synthesis of a learning system are illustrated by the derivation of a receiver for the detection of signals of unknown amplitude in white Gaussian noise. the correct classification of the learning sequence is known the machine learns with a teacher.) It is the purpose of this paper to suggest a mathematical model for such problems and to show that the solution of the model problem is a finite-size machine which uses its exper ience on the learning sequence to improve its performance. An opt imum mat’hematical solution to the problem is found. This mat’hematical solution is in the form of a recursive equat ion describing the structure of a relatively simple delay-feedback system. The “optimality” of the system as a solution to the problem depends upon the accuracy with which the mathematical model describes the actual situation. The application of the model and the synthesis of a learning system are illustrated by deriving a receiver for the detection of signals of unknown amplitude embedded in white Gaussian noise. 1.

In general, a loss function is also required to define except that we have classified k 1 Inore vectors. Thus, the problem; however, for simplicity we shall assume that in repetitive problems a sequence (called a “learning each kind of error is equally costly. We shall also assume sequence”) of observat ions (vectors) ultimately becomes that the classes are equally likely, so that we can judge available. It is possible to use this sequence to ‘?earn” the performance of the machine on the basis of the frethe values of the unknown parameters, even when the quency of misrecognition. correct classifkation of any one (or all) of the members h’lost pattern recognition problems may be categorized of the sequence is unknown.

Parametric problems are those in which the functional forms of the densities are known within a finite set of parameters, and our purpose in this paper is to discuss the structure of a class of machines to solve these problems; however, a brief review of the solution when (p(X 1 wi); i = 1, 2, . . . , Al} are known completely will provide a useful foundation. When these densities are known, the system which minimizes the probability of misrecognition does so by deciding that the object is in the class which results in the largest p(X 1 wi) (Abramson and Braverman [4]). Figure 1 shows such a machine. In this system the vector X is processed by computing each of the conditional densities (p(X 1 wi); i = 1, 2, . . + , J/r} and comparing them to determine the largest. (For more general loss functions, the minimum average risk machine still computes the p(X / wi), but compares them differently; the heart of the machine is still the p(X [ wi) computer.)	adaptive system;categorization;detection theory;embedded system;interrupt request (pc architecture);loss function;mathematical model;pattern recognition;recursion;relevance;statistical classification	Stanley C.

The MUSIC algorithm is known to have an infinite resolution power in theory. However, in the presence of modeling errors, sources can not be resolved with certainty, even if the array correlation matrix is perfectly known. The focus of this paper is to predict the bias and variance of the DOA estimates taking into account the possible resolution failure of MUSIC. This performance prediction, based on our recent mathematical investigation, is new to the best of our knowledge. A general mathematical framework to derive closed form expressions of the bias and variance versus the model mismatch, conditioned on a general statistical resolution test is proposed. In order to illustrate our mathematical approach, statistical tests with one and two conditions, respectively, are investigated. The accuracy of the performance prediction is illustrated in a simulation study. It is found that the proposed approach outperforms the “classical” technique, which ignores the possible resolution failure of the MUSIC algorithm. Therefore, our results provide better tools for determining the necessary antenna calibration accuracy to achieve some targeted specifications on the estimator performance.	algorithm;direction of arrival;performance prediction;sensor;simulation	Anne Ferréol;Pascal Larzabal;Mats Viberg	2010	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2010.2049263	econometrics;speech recognition;performance;multiple signal classification;signal processing;antenna;mathematics;accuracy and precision;statistics	Robotics	53.13403930833681	10.333792031326892	157817

The framework is developed based on formulating the binary hypothesis testing problem from a decision-theoretic perspective. This formulation results in a representation for the minimum average cost that is analogous to that for the minimum probability of error. Taking advantage of this analogy, a whole new series of generalized bounds on the minimum average cost is obtained by employing the well-developed theory of bounds of the minimum probability of error problem available in the literature. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed unified framework, two upper bounds on the minimum cost, that generalize the known Bhattacharyya and Chernoff upper bounds on the minimum probability of error, are derived. The unified framework is also used to obtain a new generalized class of upper and lower bounds in terms of a modified form of the f-divergence. All new bounds derived in the paper are shown to reduce to the probability of error bounds under special cost assignments. ( 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

408eaf0b153597c41e80dfc9dc4c02a63717c87b	noise response data reveal novel controllability gramian for nonlinear network dynamics		Control of nonlinear large-scale dynamical networks, e.g., collective behavior of agents interacting via a scale-free connection topology, is a central problem in many scientific and engineering fields. For the linear version of this problem, the so-called controllability Gramian has played an important role to quantify how effectively the dynamical states are reachable by a suitable driving input. In this paper, we first extend the notion of the controllability Gramian to nonlinear dynamics in terms of the Gibbs distribution. Next, we show that, when the networks are open to environmental noise, the newly defined Gramian is equal to the covariance matrix associated with randomly excited, but uncontrolled, dynamical state trajectories. This fact theoretically justifies a simple Monte Carlo simulation that can extract effectively controllable subdynamics in nonlinear complex networks. In addition, the result provides a novel insight into the relationship between controllability and statistical mechanics.	anatomy, regional;complex network;dynamical system;gramian matrix;interaction;leucaena pulverulenta;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;randomness;respiratory mechanics;simulation;uncontrolled format string	Kenji Kashima	2016		10.1038/srep27300	mathematical optimization;controllability;controllability gramian;network controllability	ML	42.78191989057538	6.9703447402606065	158470

This NLA design problem seeks an optimal geometry from the class of fully-augmentable arrays (ie. those with a complete set of intersensor differences) created to support the generalised spatial smoothing (GSS) algorithm, whose aim is to resolve the directions-of-arrival (DOA’s) of some number of fully correlated signals. This problem is identified as an integer multicriteria optimisation (MO) problem. Presented results indicate that significant improvements in DOA estimation accuracy may be achieved by such optimised geometries compared with uniform or minimumredundancy arrays.	algorithm;charge-coupled device;coherence (physics);direction of arrival;kernel density estimation;mathematical optimization;numerical linear algebra;signal processing;smoothing	Nicholas K.

We in particular discuss three different error criteria: i) minimizing the mean square distance error (distance-based MSE), ii) minimizing the mean square power error (power-based MSE), iii) minimizing the mean square relative distance error (relative distance-based MSE). The goal is to assess the impact of the chosen error criterion on the estimate accuracy. Simulation results show that i) flip ambiguities in the position estimate may occur when the node to be positioned is very close to the signal source, ii) in presence of flip ambiguities, provided that RSS measurements are combined with information about the signal arrival direction, relative distance-based MSE minimization offers better accuracy in a bi-dimensional localization scenario1.	mean squared error;rss;simulation	Giuseppe Bianchi;Nicola Blefari-Melazzi;Francesca Lo Piccolo	2007	2007 12th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications	10.1109/ISCC.2007.4381640	filter;kalman filter;minimum mean square error;mathematical optimization;computer science;maximum likelihood;statistics	Mobile	51.52556393141858	5.043106884286049	158638

47a2718769d9a10046ba01a641769a40899d96b8	universality of 8-state reversible and conservative triangular partitioned cellular automata		A partitioned cellular automaton (PCA) is a subclass of a standard CA such that each cell is divided into several parts, and the next state of a cell is determined only by the adjacent parts of its neighbor cells. This framework is useful for designing reversible CAs. Here, we investigate isotropic three-neighbor 8-state triangular PCAs where a cell has three parts, and each part has two states. They are called elementary triangular PCAs (ETPCAs). There are 256 ETPCAs, and they are extremely simple since each of their local transition functions is described by only four local rules. In this paper, we study computational universality of nine kinds of reversible and conservative ETPCAs. It has already been shown that one of them is universal. Here, we newly show universality of another. It is proved by showing that a Fredkin gate, a universal reversible logic gate, can be simulated in it. From these results and by dualities, we can conclude six among the nine are universal. We also show the remaining three are non-universal. Thus, universality of all the reversible and conservative ETPCAs is clarified.	cellular automaton;universality probability	Kenichi Morita	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-44365-2_5	arithmetic;algorithm	Crypto	39.20177074361754	8.999908862819696	159025

This assumption is deduced from the procedure in which the model is built and it corresponds to commonly accepted understanding that with increasing magnitude of a measured quantity, the measurement errors (noise) are also increasing. This approach based on the signal dependent noise permits a new view on searching an optimum signal with respect to its possible identification. Two measures are employed for this purpose. The first one is the traditional one and is based exclusively on the firing rate. This criterion gives as an optimum signal any sufficiently strong signal. The second measure, which takes into the account not only the firing rate but also its variability and which is based on Fisher information determines uniquely the optimum signal in the considered model. This is in contrast to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model with constant amplitude of the noise.	severo ornstein	Laura Sacerdote;Cristina Zucca;Petr Láanskáy	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-75555-5_35	econometrics;signal transfer function;analog signal;machine learning;mathematics;matched filter;stochastic resonance;statistics	ML	53.246430456388566	13.63366122933186	159504

We have developed parameter estimation algorithms to find the means and variances of the threshold voltage distribution that is modeled as a Gaussian mixture. The proposed methods find the best-fit parameters by minimizing the squared Euclidean distance between the measured threshold voltage values and those obtained from the Gaussian mixture model. For the parameter estimation, the gradient descent (GD) and the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) based methods are employed. The developed algorithms are applied to both simulated and real NAND flash memory. It is also demonstrated that error correction with the estimated mean and variance values yields much better performance when compared to the method that only updates the mean.	approximation algorithm;curve fitting;error detection and correction;estimation theory;euclidean distance;flash memory;gradient descent;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;mixture model	Dong-hwan Lee;Wonyong Sung	2013	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2012.2222399	normal distribution;error detection and correction;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics	Metrics	48.151528270995634	4.573143626604491	159744

We propose a solution that improves extent estimation. Using intermediary solutions, we demonstrate the impact of model mismatches. Our solution matches a reasonable measurement model exactly. Hence, we verify the filter and are confident in our results. In typical situations, model mismatches lead to incorrect results, as we show for the current and intermediary solutions that give poorer results as targets move away from the sensor.	experiment;extended precision;model checking;particle filter;track-before-detect	Paolo Pileggi;Martin Podt	2016	2016 19th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)		computer vision;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	51.855453390175306	5.658839312319816	159801

The beamforming and source localization are the most computationally intensive operations in the network. In this paper, we introduce a class of computationally efficient source localization algorithms. The novel source localization estimators also include the speed of propagation estimation since it is often unknown. For a more robust solution, a parametric source tracking algorithm is developed based on a linear track assumption. We also derive the Cramer-Rao bound for source localization and speed of propagation estimations using a randomly distributed sensor array. A blind beamforming approach, which enhances the strongest signal while attenuating other interferences, using only the measured data is presented. The maximum power collection criterion is used to obtain array weights from the dominant eigenvector of the sample correlation matrix. In many practical scenarios, the locations of some of the sensors may be unknown or non-stationary. From three or more source locations and source distances, we formulate a least-squares estimator for the unknown sensor location. Systematic evaluations via simulations show the proposed algorithms are effective and efficient with respect to the Cramer-Rao bound. The proposed algorithms are also shown to be effective in the examples using measured data.	beamforming;randomness	J. C. Chen;Kung Yao;T. L. Tung;Chris W.

Though commonly studied for unstructured, dense matrices, matrices with more structure are often of interest because they model constraints on the sensing system or allow more efficient system implementations. In this paper we derive a concentration of measure bound for block diagonal matrices where the nonzero entries along the main diagonal are a single repeated block of i.i.d. Gaussian random variables. Our main result states that the concentration exponent, in the best case, scales as that for a fully dense matrix. We also identify the role that the signal diversity plays in distinguishing the best and worst cases. Finally, we illustrate these phenomena with a series of experiments.	best, worst and average case;experiment;randomized algorithm;social inequality;sparse matrix	Christopher J.

3d04820684f230dec00cb1a598b8a5abeaa685aa	approximate quantum markov chains		This chapter reviews the concept of a Markov chain for random variables and then introduces a generalization to quantum mechanical systems. We discuss the subtle differences between classical and quantum Markov chains and point out difficulties that show up in the quantum case. Unlike the classical case that has been analyzed and understood well in the past, certain aspects of quantum Markov chains remained mysterious. Only very recently, it has been recognized how an entropic characterization of states that approximately satisfy the Markov condition looks like. This insight justifies the definition of approximate quantum Markov chains which this book is about. Markov chains are named after the Russian mathematician Andrei Markov (1856-1922), who introduced them in 1907. Suppose we have a sequence of random variables (Xn)n≥1. The simplest model is the case where the random variables are assumed to be pairwise independent. For this scenario many nice results, such as the law of large number or the central limit theorem, are known. At the same time the pairwise independence assumption makes the model rather restrictive. Markov’s idea was to consider a more general dependence structure that however is still simple enough that it can be analyzed rigorously. Informally, his idea was to assume that the random variables (Xn)n≥1 are ordered in a very specific way. This ordering implies that all the information that the random variables (X1, · · · ,Xk−1) could have about Xk for any k > 1 is contained in Xk−1. More precisely, we require that the collective entire past (X1, . . . ,Xk−2) is independent of the collective entire future (Xk, . . .) conditioned on the present Xk−1. This model has the advantage that in order to describe Xk we only need to remember Xk−1 and can forget about the past (X1, . . . ,Xk−2). This makes the model simple enough that we can prove precise properties and describe its behavior for large values of n. At the same time, the model is considerably more general than the pairwise independence assumption which makes it suitable for many situations (see, e.g., [4, 97, 108, 113]). Markov chains are intensively studied and have been generalized to the quantum mechanical setup [1] where random variables are replaced by density operators on a Hilbert space. Natural questions that arise are: 1 We then say (Xn)n≥1 forms a Markov chain in order X1↔ X2↔ X3↔ . . . . 2 In Section 1.2 and in particular in Section 5.1 we introduce the concept of a quantum Markov chain.	approximation algorithm;hilbert space;limit cycle;quantum markov chain;quantum mechanics	David Sutter	2018	CoRR		discrete mathematics;robustness (computer science);inequality;mathematics;quantum;markov chain	Theory	43.996970663836436	15.850157142305886	161016

According to the rotational invariance relationship between the dipoles and the loops, the polarization parameter estimations are obtained. On the basis of the subspace theory, the array steering vectors are got, the phase differences of the virtual array elements are acquired according to the feature that the phase differences between the array elements of two ends of diameter and the coordinate origin are opposite. The virtual short baselines between the virtual and actual array elements are obtained, the rough but unambiguous estimates of DOA are herein achieved. The precise but ambiguous estimates of DOA are got by using the long baseline of actual array elements, these above-mentioned ambiguities can be disambiguated by using the virtual baseline method, the high-precision estimations of DOA are herein acquired. The parameters of this method can be automatically matching.

In this coding procedure the input is sampled at Nyquist's rate or faster, the samples undergo dithered uniform or lattice quantiza-tion, using subtractive dither, and the quantizer output is entropy coded. The rate-distortion performance, and the trade-oo between the sampling rate and the quantization accuracy is investigated , utilizing the observation that the coding scheme is equivalent to an additive noise channel. It is shown that the mean-square error of the scheme is xed as long as the product of the sampling period and the quantizer second moment is kept constant, while for a xed distortion the coding rate generally increases when the sampling rate exceeds the Nyquist rate. Finally, as the lattice quantizer dimension becomes large, the equivalent additive noise channel of the scheme tends to be Gaussian, and both the rate and the distortion performance becomes invariant to the sampling rate.	additive white gaussian noise;bandlimiting;distortion;dither;entropy encoding;major stationary source;mean squared error;nyquist frequency;nyquist rate;quantization (signal processing);sampling (signal processing);stationary process;utility functions on indivisible goods	Ram Zamir;Meir Feder	1995	IEEE Trans.

We show that if a regenerative sequence {Xn}n≥0 with canonical measure π could be generated then a consistent estimator of λ ≡ ∫ S fdπ can be produced. We further show that under appropriate second moment conditions, a confidence interval for λ can also be derived.

It has been shown that some of these beamformers can be formulated equivalently as one-dimensional (ID) covariance fitting problems. Based on this formulation, we show that these beamformers lead to inherently nonoptimum results in the presence of interferers. To mitigate the detrimental effect of interferers, we extend the ID covariance fitting approach to multidimensional (MD) covariance fitting, modeling the source steering vectors by means of uncertainty sets. The proposed MD covariance fitting approach leads to a nonconvex optimization problem. We develop a convex approximation of this problem, which can be solved, for example, by means of the logarithmic barrier method. The complexity required to compute the barrier function and its first- and second-order derivatives is derived. Simulation results show that the proposed beamformer based on MD covariance fitting achieves an improved performance as compared to the state-of-the-art narrowband beamformers in scenarios with large sample support.	adaptive beamformer;approximation algorithm;barrier function;beamforming;best, worst and average case;curve fitting;interior point method;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation	Michael Rübsamen;Alex B.

05c88f3f0d2a5a0816b1cb0705547f592d8526b9	improved doa estimators using partial relaxation approach		In this paper, the partial relaxation approach is introduced and applied to DOA estimation using spectral search. Unlike existing methods like Capon or MUSIC which can be considered as single source approximations of multi-source estimation criteria, the proposed approach accounts for the existence of multiple sources. At each direction, the manifold structure of interfering signals impinging on the sensor array is relaxed, which results in closed form estimates for the interference parameters. The conventional multidimensional optimization problem reduces, thanks to this relaxation, to a simple spectral search. Following this principle, proposed estimators based on the Deterministic Maximum Likelihood, Weighted Subspace Fitting and Covariance Fitting method are derived. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed estimators is superior to conventional methods especially in the case of low SNR and low number of snapshots, irrespectively of the special structure of the sensor array.	approximation;computation;computational complexity theory;curve fitting;direction of arrival;estimation of distribution algorithm;interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;microsoft outlook for mac;multi-source;optimization problem;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Minh Trinh-Hoang;Mats Viberg;Marius Pesavento	2017	2017 IEEE 7th International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)	10.1109/CAMSAP.2017.8313156	estimator;maximum likelihood;mathematical optimization;sensor array;interference (wave propagation);subspace topology;covariance;mathematics;optimization problem	Vision	51.661108600366276	7.339242720487797	162356

We devise a constrained Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) for the resulting hypothesis testing problem, enforcing the primary data covariance matrix (due to both interference and multipath echoes) to belong to a neighborhood of the secondary data sample covariance matrix. Remarkably, the proposed decision scheme ensures the desirable Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) property with respect to the unknown parameters of the interference. The performance assessment, conducted on simulated data in terms of detection probability also in comparison with existing solutions, highlights the effectiveness of the new approach to cope with diffuse multipath phenomena.	constant false alarm rate;image scaling;interference (communication);multipath propagation;radar;sensor	Augusto Aubry;Antonio De Maio;Goffredo Foglia;Danilo Orlando	2015	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2014.2388439	estimation of covariance matrices;surface roughness;electrical engineering;pattern recognition;mathematics;interference;radar;statistics	Vision	51.90322320697911	10.001153535460563	162469

A representation of a general, polarized, nonisotropic noise process is used to determine the cross-spectral densities and cross-correlation functions between arbitrarily oriented dipole antenna array elements in the presence of a noise field only. Several examples have been worked out for isotropic noise to show the variation of the cross-correlated noise function vs. the spatial separation of the dipoles. One important result is that the noise cross correlation is shown to be a function of the receiver element spatial orientation when the elements are dipoles. For certain spatial orientations between dipoles it is possible to reduce the noise cross correlation between these antenna array elements to zero.	cross-correlation	Donald G. Childers;Irving S.

For that reason Discussion Papers may not be reproduced or distributed without the written consent of the author. This paper studies minimaxity of estimators of a set of linear combinations of location parameters µ i , i = 1,. .. , k under quadratic loss. When each location parameter is known to be positive, previous results about minimaxity or non-minimaxity are extended from the case of estimating a single linear combination, to estimating any number of linear combinations. Necessary and/or sufficient conditions for minimaxity of general estimators are derived. Particular attention is paid to the generalized Bayes estimator with respect to the uniform distribution and to the truncated version of the unbiased estimator (which is the maximum likelihood estimator for symmetric unimodal distributions). A necessary and sufficient condition for minimaxity of the uniform prior generalized Bayes estimator is particularly simple; If one estimates θ = Aµ where A is an ℓ × k known matrix, the estimator is minimax if and only if (AA t) ij ≤ 0 for any i and j, (i ̸ = j). This condition is also sufficient (but not necessary) for minimaxity of the MLE.	minimax	Tatsuya Kubokawa;William E. Strawderman	2011	J.

Our method uses Fourier transforms to efficiently compute the forward stochastic reach probability measure (density) and the forward stochastic reach set. This method is applicable to systems with bounded or unbounded disturbance sets. We also examine the convexity properties of the forward stochastic reach set and its probability density. Motivated by the problem of a robot attempting to capture a stochastically moving, non-adversarial target, we demonstrate our method on two simple examples. Where traditional approaches provide approximations, our method provides exact analytical expressions for the densities and probability of capture.	approximation;linear system;reachability;robot;scalability;uncontrolled format string	Abraham P.

For a single sensor array composed of four sensors deployed with a square, three angle estimates on fire bearing can be obtained using far-field localization technology. These angle estimates are used to get their statistical mean and variance at a single time. Based on the statistical features, we propose two fire localization methods under the RRR frame, which are angle bisector and nonlinear filtering methods. For the angle bisector method, a recursive formula of the mean and variance is presented in time series so that global angle estimates can be used. Furthermore, a fire coordinate estimate, which is actually the center of estimated-range circle, can be taken by use of intersecting two angle bisectors from two sensor arrays. Moreover, the estimation of a radius for the estimated fire region is also realized. In order to improve localization accuracy and robustness of fire estimation to non-Gaussian noise component, the fire localization is taken as a nonlinear bearing-only tracking issue for the case where the covariance of measurement noise is unknown and a specific variational Bayesian adaptive square-cubature Kalman filter is proposed to estimate the coordinate of the center. These proposed algorithms not only provide some new points of view on the fire localization for limited interior space, but are helpful for practical fire fighting applications.	algorithm;analog signal;calculus of variations;coefficient;computation;hp 48 series;internationalization and localization;kalman filter;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;nonlinear system;numerical integration;recursion;resilient packet ring;resolution (logic);sampling (signal processing);sensor;sorting;time series;visual intercept	Quanbo Ge;Chenglin Wen;Sheng'an Duan	2014	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2014.2308974	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;angle bisector theorem;computer science;engineering;machine learning;mathematics;sensor array;statistics	Robotics	52.85564387986839	5.49538561390777	163823

The sources considered output strings according to probability distributions in which no single string is too probable.The new model provides a fruitful viewpoint on problems studied previously such as: • Extracting almost-perfect bits from sources of weak randomness. The question of possibility as well as the question of efficiency of such extraction schemes are addressed. • Probabilistic communication complexity. It is shown that most functions have linear communication complexity in a very strong probabilistic sense. • Robustness of BPP with respect to sources of weak randomness (generalizing a result of Vazirani and Vazirani [32], [33]).	communication complexity;randomness	Benny Chor;Oded Goldreich	1988	SIAM J.

Starting from the integral representation for the partition function in complex space we construct error bounds for its asymptotic expansion obtained by the saddle point method. The derivation of error bounds is based on an idea by Olver applicable to integral transforms with an exponentially decaying kernel. The bounds are expressed in terms of the supremum of a certain function and are asymptotic to the absolute value of the first neglected term in the expansion as the large parameter approaches infinity. The application of these error bounds is illustrated for two classes of queueing models: loss systems and single chain closed queueing networks.	approximation;asymptote;partition function (mathematics);queueing theory;steady state	Alexander Birman;Yaakov Kogan	1996	Queueing Syst.	10.1007/BF01206558	erlang distribution;probability distribution;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;markov model;upper and lower bounds;partition function;steady state;exponential decay;statistics;integral transform;asymptotic expansion	Metrics	41.4625731758912	11.112683396562556	165009

a1dd3365795425634c1ba889afe84530a6cb759d	optimal number of measurements for compressed sensing with quadratically decreasing snr		In this paper, we consider a practical signal transmission application with fixed power budget such as radar/sonar. The system is modeled by a linear equation with the assumption that the signal energy per measurement decreases linearly and the noise energy per measurement increases approximately linearly with the increasing of the number of measurements. Thus the SNR decreases quadratically with the number of measurements. This model suggests an optimal operation point different from the common wisdom where more measurements always mean better performance. Our analysis shows that there is an optimal number of measurements, neither too few nor too many, to minimize the mean-squared error of the estimate. The analysis is based on a state evolution technique which is proposed for the approximate message passing algorithm. We consider the Gaussian, Bernoulli-Gaussian and least-favorite distributions in both real and complex domains. Numerical results justify the correctness of our analysis.	approximation algorithm;bernoulli polynomials;compressed sensing;correctness (computer science);linear equation;mean squared error;message passing;numerical method;radar;sonar (symantec);signal-to-noise ratio	Yang Lu;Wei Dai;Yonina C.

This is known as the matrix completion problem, and comes up in a great number of applications, including the famous Netflix Prize and other similar questions in collaborative filtering. In general, accurate recovery of a matrix from a small number of entries is impossible, but the knowledge that the unknown matrix has low rank radically changes this premise, making the search for solutions meaningful. This paper presents optimality results quantifying the minimum number of entries needed to recover a matrix of rank r exactly by any method whatsoever (the information theoretic limit). More importantly, the paper shows that, under certain incoherence assumptions on the singular vectors of the matrix, recovery is possible by solving a convenient convex program as soon as the number of entries is on the order of the information theoretic limit (up to logarithmic factors). This convex program simply finds, among all matrices consistent with the observed entries, that with minimum nuclear norm. As an example, we show that on the order of nr log(n) samples are needed to recover a random n x n matrix of rank r by any method, and to be sure, nuclear norm minimization succeeds as soon as the number of entries is of the form nr polylog(n).	collaborative filtering;convex optimization;information theory;linear programming relaxation;netflix prize;the matrix	Emmanuel J.

When operating on a list of n data, permuted uniformly at random, the appropriately normalized complexity Yn is known to converge almost surely to a non-degenerate random limit Y. This assumes a natural embedding of all Yn on one probability space, e.g., via random binary search trees. In this note a central limit theorem for the error term in the latter almost sure convergence is shown: n 2 log n (Yn − Y) d −→ N (n → ∞), where N denotes a standard normal random variable.	algorithm;automated theorem proving;converge;norm (social);quicksort	Ralph Neininger	2012	CoRR		combinatorics;mathematics;quicksort	Theory	40.91945290740192	14.338027560026282	166451

Owing to the existence of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) radio propagation, unfortunately, not all the measured distances are reliable. One way to tackle the problem of positioning is therefore to take two-steps: (i) identifying the NLOS measurements; (ii) smart signal processing of the mixed LOS and NLOS measurements. This paper is focused on the second issue. Under the assumption that the NLOS measurements have been identified, we first propose a simple method to suppress the effect of the NLOS error. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves similar or better accuracy than several other known methods and the computational complexity is reduced considerably. We also present an optimal location estimator under the assumption of Gaussian distributed measurement noise and Rayleigh distributed NLOS error. Although it is difficult to achieve the optimal performance in practice due to modeling uncertainties, the optimal estimator provides a performance benchmark.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);computational complexity theory;line-of-sight (missile);rayleigh–ritz method;signal processing;simulation;software propagation	Kegen Yu;Yingjie Jay Guo	2007	2007 IEEE 65th Vehicular Technology Conference - VTC2007-Spring	10.1109/VETECS.2007.228	electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;wireless network;signal processing	Mobile	51.945408776195855	5.2575623701985545	166733

By proper formulation of the detection problem as a test of statistical hypotheses, the precise structure of the optimum detector can be specified and minimum detectable signals uniquely determined. For threshold reception (the problem of main interest) two classes of operation arise: if detection is coherent, as far as dependence on the input signal-to-noise ratio is concerned one has a linear system, no matter how weak the signal; on the other hand for incoherent reception one always has a quadratic dependence on this input ratio' (modulation suppression). Threshold reception in these two instances requires respectively a suitably weighted cross-correlation of the received data with the a, priori known signal, or a suitably weighted autocorrelation of the reoeived data with itself. The optimum detector is in general a computer, involving non-linear operations and terminating in a decision operation, which depends on the type of statistical test (e.g. Neyman-Pearson, Ideal, Sequential, etc.) defining the observer.

In this way optimum performance, consistent with the external constraints, is specified, and the extent by which actual systems depart from this limiting optimum can be calculated.	analog signal;autocorrelation;coherence (physics);computer;cross-correlation;detection theory;download;linear system;modulation;nonlinear system;rewriting;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;zero suppression	David Middleton	1954	Trans. of the IRE Professional Group on Information Theory (TIT)	10.1109/IREPGIT.1954.6373398	econometrics;electronic engineering;mathematics;statistics	ML	51.922249177468046	13.981728665983583	166743

In most array processing the sensor array geometry is fixed and known and the steering array vector/manifold information is used in beamformation. In this system, array calibration may be impractical due to unknown placement and orientation of the sensors with unknown frequency/spatial responses. This paper proposes a blind beamforming technique, using only the measured sensor data, to form either a sample data or a sample correlation matrix. The maximum power collection criterion is used to obtain array weights from the dominant eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of a matrix eigenvalue problem. Theoretical justification of this approach uses a generalization of Szeg ̈ o’s theory of the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues of the Toeplitz form. An efficient blind beamforming time delay estimate of the dominant source is proposed. Source localization based on a least squares (LS) method for time delay estimation is also given. Results based on analysis, simulation, and measured acoustical sensor data show the effectiveness of this beamforming technique for signal enhancement and space–time filtering.	array processing;beamforming;broadcast delay;digital signal processing;eigenvalue algorithm;least squares;maximum power transfer theorem;randomness;sensor;simulation;toeplitz hash algorithm	Kung Yao;Ralph E.

9d59ac3d1b10c335837b461c93d3dad1a5882744	lorentzian model of spatially coherent noise field in narrowband direction finding		When studying the radiation coming from far field sources using an array of sensors, besides the internal thermal noise, the received wave field is always perturbed by an external noise field, which can be temporally and spatially coherent to some degree, temporally incoherent and spatially coherent, spatially incoherent and temporally correlated or finally, the incoherence in both domains. Thus treating the received data needs to consider the nature of perturbing field in order to make accurate measurements such as powers of punctual sources, theirs locations and the types of waveforms which can be deterministic or random. In this paper, we study the type of temporally white and spatially coherent noise field; we propose a new spatial coherence function using Lorentz function. After briefly describing some existing models, we numerically study the effect of spatial coherence length on resolving the angular locations of closely radiating sources using spectral techniques which are divided into beam forming and subspace based methods, this study is made comparatively to temporally and spatially white noise with the same power as the proposed one in order to make a precise comparisons.	angle of arrival;angularjs;beamforming;coherence (physics);computer simulation;direction finding;download;johnson–nyquist noise;numerical analysis;perlin noise;randomness;sensor;stationary process;white noise	Youssef Khmou;Said Safi	2017	Int.

In a recent paper, a general framework for obtaining the mean and variance of additive shape parameters of tries and PATRICIA tries under the Bernoulli model was proposed. In this note, we show that a slight modification of this framework yields a central limit theorem for shape parameters, too. This central limit theorem contains many of the previous central limit theorems from the literature and it can be used to prove recent conjectures and derive new results. As an example, we will consider a refinement of the size of tries and PATRICIA tries, namely, the number of nodes of fixed outdegree and obtain (univariate and bivariate) central limit theorems. Moreover, trivariate central limit theorems for size, internal path length and internal Wiener index of tries and PATRICIA tries are derived as well.	automated theorem proving;bernoulli polynomials;bivariate data;computer science;data structure;degree (graph theory);directed graph;radix tree;refinement (computing);utility functions on indivisible goods;wiener index	Michael Fuchs;Chung-Kuei Lee	2014	Electr.

e4cfb38090c26bc5b5910551da6a1befbed3942d	comparing the switch and curveball markov chains for sampling binary matrices with fixed marginals		The Curveball algorithm is a variation on well-known switch-based Markov chain approaches for uniformly sampling binary matrices with fixed row and column sums. Instead of a switch, the Curveball algorithm performs a so-called binomial trade in every iteration of the algorithm. Intuitively, this could lead to a better convergence rate for reaching the stationary (uniform) distribution in certain cases. Some experimental evidence for this has been given in the literature. In this note we give a spectral gap comparison between two switch-based chains and the Curveball chain. In particular, this comparison allows us to conclude that the Curveball Markov chain is rapidly mixing whenever one of the two switch chains is rapidly mixing. Our analysis directly extends to the case of sampling binary matrices with forbidden entries (under the assumption of irreducibility). This in particular captures the case of sampling simple directed graphs with given degrees. As a by-product of our analysis, we show that the switch Markov chain of the Kannan-Tetali-Vempala conjecture only has non-negative eigenvalues if the sampled binary matrices have at least three columns. This shows that the Markov chain does not have to be made lazy, which is of independent interest. We also obtain an improved bound on the smallest eigenvalue for the switch Markov chain studied by Greenhill for uniformly sampling simple directed regular graphs.	algorithm;catherine;column (database);degree (graph theory);directed graph;ergodicity;gibbs sampling;graph (discrete mathematics);irreducibility;iteration;lazy evaluation;linear programming relaxation;markov chain;maxima and minima;mind;multi-commodity flow problem;p (complexity);rate of convergence;sampling (signal processing);state space;stationary process;stochastic matrix;turing completeness;vector graphics	Corrie Jacobien Carstens;Pieter Kleer	2017	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;markov chain mixing time;rate of convergence;sampling (statistics);directed graph;spectral gap;matrix (mathematics);eigenvalues and eigenvectors;markov chain	Theory	42.25526773838129	14.551895592445996	167986

Types are partitioned into irreducible equivalence classes. In this context, extinction of some classes is possible without the whole process becoming extinct. We derive criteria for the almost-sure extinction of the whole process, as well as of a specific class, conditionally given the class of the initial particle. We give sufficient conditions under which the extinction of a class implies the extinction of another class or of the whole process. Finally, we show that the extinction probability of a specific class is the minimal nonnegative solution of the usual extinction equation but with added constraints.	extinction probability;irreducibility;turing completeness	Sophie Hautphenne	2012	J.

The proposed method firstly performs the vectorization operation on the covariance matrix, which is calculated from the latest received data matrix obtained by a reduced dimensional transformation. Then a weighted matrix is introduced to transform the covariance estimation errors into a Gaussian white vector, and the proposed method further constructs the other reweighted vector to enhance sparse solution. Finally, a reweighted smoothed l0-norm minimization framework with a reweighted continuous function is designed, based on which the sparse solution is obtained by using a decreasing parameter sequence and the steepest ascent algorithm. Consequently, DOA estimation is accomplished by searching the spectrum of the solution. Compared with the conventional l1-norm minimization based methods, the proposed reweighted smoothed l0-norm algorithm significantly reduces the computation time of DOA estimation. The proposed method is about two orders of magnitude faster than the l1-SVD, reweighted l1-SVD and RV l1-SRACV algorithms. Meanwhile, it provides higher spatial angular resolution and better angle estimation performance. Simulation results are used to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.	direction of arrival;mimo;smoothing	Jing Liu;Weidong Zhou;Filbert H.

The class of +&xiag pnxessea considered is seen to be quite general and allows flexible modeling of a variety of dependent noises. Applying the criterion of asymptotic relative efficiency, the de-sign of the optimal memoryless detector is specified and is seen to depend only on second-order statistical knowledge of the noise. It is then shown that in many cases this design reduces to approximating the noise process with an m-dependent process, finding the corresponding nonlinearity as a solution to a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, and obtaining the optimal nonlinearity tbrougb a hniting process. In addition, conditions are given for the existence of a unique optimal nonlkarity. A bound on the performance of the optimal +mixing detector relative to that of the detector designed under an m-dependent assumption is given. Extensions to the case of detectors with memory are considered.	nonlinear system;sensor	Don R. Halverson;Gary L. Wise	1980	IEEE Trans.

Properties and operational interpretations are presented for this notion of directed information, which generalizes mutual information between stochastic processes in a similar manner as Massey's original notion of directed information generalizes Shannon's mutual information in the discrete-time setting. As a key application, Duncan's theorem is generalized to estimation problems in which the evolution of the target signal is affected by the past channel noise, and the causal minimum mean squared error estimation is related to directed information from the target signal to the observation corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. An analogous relationship holds for the Poisson channel.	additive white gaussian noise;causal filter;mean squared error;mutual information;noise (electronics);shannon (unit);stochastic process;utility functions on indivisible goods	Young-Han Kim;Haim H.

In contrast to the existing Gaussianity measures, we propose a novel measure, which is based on Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the Gaussian probability density function (PDF) and the generalized Gaussian PDF incorporated with the skewness for the normality test. In our studies, conventional normality tests may often not be robust when they are employed for the non-Gaussian processes with symmetric PDFs. We call this new test as the KGGS test. Our proposed KGGS test is heuristically justified to be more robust than conventional tests for different PDFs, especially symmetric PDFs. A popular application of the normality test for QPSK signal detections is also presented to verify the effectiveness of our proposed technique and the simulation results demonstrate that our new KGGS test would outperform all others even for sparse data samples.	gaussian process;heuristic;kullback–leibler divergence;portable document format;real-time clock;receiver operating characteristic;sensor;simulation;sparse matrix;statistical signal processing;stochastic process;turing test;unix signal	Lu Lu;Kun Yan;Hsiao-Chun Wu;Shih Yu Chang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2013.040213.121055	econometrics;pattern recognition;probability;gaussian process;mathematics;normality test;kullback–leibler divergence;statistics;detection theory	ML	51.19482964005668	11.140995137677004	170460

Specifically if a node set S graph separates nodes u and v then Xu is conditionally independent of Xv given XS . The opposite direction need not be true, that is, Xu ⊥ Xv | XS need not imply S is a node separator of u and v. When it does, the relation Xu ⊥ Xv | XS is called faithful. In this paper we provide a characterization of faithful relations and then provide an algorithm to test faithfulness based only on knowledge of other conditional relations of the form Xi ⊥ Xj | XS .	algorithm;graphical model;markov chain;markov property;xs (perl)	De Wen Soh;Sekhar C.

7048fc38c73c0d0dffb39298b867cb8e739c17e9	a note on the bivariate distribution representation of two perfectly correlated random variables by dirac's $δ$-function		In this paper we discuss the representation of the joint prob ability density function of perfectly correlated continuo us random variables, i.e., with correlation coefficients ρ=±1, by Dirac’s δ-function. We also show how this representation allows to de fine Dirac’s δ-function as the ratio between bivariate distributions and the marginal distribution in the limit ρ → ±1, whenever this limit exists. We illustrate this with the example of the biva r ate Rice distribution. I. I NTRODUCTION The performance evaluation of wireless communications sys tem relies on the analysis of the behavior of signals modele d as random variables or random processes that obey prescribe d probability distribution laws. The Pearson product-mome nt correlation coefficient is commonly used to quantify the str ength of the relationship between two random variables. For example, in wireless communications, two-antenna diversi ty systems take advantage of low signal correlation. The div rs ty gain obtained by combining the received signals at the two an tenna branches depends on the amount of correlation between them, e.g., the lower the correlation the higher the diversi ty gain, [1]. Moreover, when the correlation coefficient is 1 or −1 it is said that the two signals are perfectly correlated, which im plies that there is no diversity gain. In this case the joint p robability distribution of the signals is not well-defined and, to the be st knowledge of the authors, a thorough discussion of these l imit cases is not found in the literature. Here, we fill this gap. We therefore investigate in this letter the representation of the joint probability distribution in the limit case of pe rf ctly correlated random variables. And show that this is achieved by Dirac’sδ-function, [2]. Based on this, we propose a representation of Dirac’s δ-function as the ratio between bivariate distributions and the marginal distribution in the limit ρ → ±1. An example of the evaluation of the limit is provided for the bivariate R ice distribution. II. D IRAC’ S δ-FUNCTION REPRESENTATION Let X ∈ R and Y ∈ R be two random variables defined on some probability space. Th us, t e Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between them is defined as, [3] ρ = E[(x − μX)(y − μY )] σXσY , (1) whereE[.] denotes the expected value operator, μX = E[x] andμY = E[x] denote the mean values, and σX andσY denote the standard deviations, i.e. σX = √ E[x2]− μX andσY = √ E[y2]− μY 2. (2) Definition (1) ensures that −1 ≤ ρ ≤ 1. Let fX,Y (x, y) denote thejoint probability density function 1of the two random variables X andY . By definition we have that fX,Y (x, y) = fY |X(y | x)fX(x) = fX|Y (x | y)fY (y), (3) wherefY |X(y | x) and fX|Y (x | y) are theconditional distributions,fX(x) andfY (y) denote themarginal distributions of variablesX andY , respectively.

Subject to the rank-restricted isometry property, nuclear norm minimization is a guaranteed algorithm for rank minimization. The resulting semidefinite formulation is a convex problem but in practice the algorithms for it do not scale well to large instances. Instead, we explore missing terms in the analogy and propose a new algorithm which is computationally efficient and also has a performance guarantee. The algorithm is based on the atomic decomposition of the matrix variable and extends the idea in the CoSaMP algorithm for ℓ0-norm minimization. Combined with the recent fast low rank approximation of matrices based on randomization, the proposed algorithm can efficiently handle large scale rank minimization problems.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;convex optimization;empirical risk minimization;low-rank approximation;restricted isometry property;semidefinite programming;the matrix	Kiryung Lee;Yoram Bresler	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2009.5205530	algorithm design;minimisation;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;sparse matrix;information theory;numerical analysis;restricted isometry property;mathematics;matrix decomposition;algorithm;statistics;low-rank approximation;algebra	Vision	48.13117567283592	8.044633975054344	171533

43b607cb721cfddccb564a1fbfcf15deeed2b2ac	influence systems vs reaction systems		In Systems Biology, modelers develop more and more reaction-based models to describe the mechanistic biochemical reactions underlying cell processes. They may also work, however, with a simpler formalism of influence graphs, to merely describe the positive and negative influences between molecular species. The first approach is promoted by reaction model exchange formats such as SBML, and tools like CellDesigner, while the second is supported by other tools that have been historically developed to reason about boolean gene regulatory networks. In practice, modelers often reason with both kinds of formalisms, and may find an influence model useful in the process of building a reaction model. In this paper, we introduce a formalism of influence systems with forces, and put it in parallel with reaction systems with kinetics, in order to develop a similar hierarchy of boolean, discrete, stochastic and differential semantics. We show that the expressive power of influence systems is the same as that of reaction systems under the differential semantics, but weaker under the other interpretations, in the sense that some discrete behaviours of reaction systems cannot be expressed by influence systems. This approach leads us to consider a positive boolean semantics which we compare to the asynchronous semantics of gene regulatory networks à la Thomas. We study the monotonicity properties of the positive boolean semantics and derive from them an efficient algorithm to compute attractors.	algorithm;gene regulatory network;kinetics internet protocol;linear algebra;sbml;semantics (computer science);systems biology	François Fages;Thierry Martinez;David A.

The use of the wavelet representation of signals to perform a new detection scheme is discussed. The advantage of using this particular representation is shown. It is shown that prior information regarding the relative bandwidth and the time-bandwidth-product of the signal to be detected is efficiently incorporated into the detection problem formulation. Thus, the proposed detection scheme is most suitable for detection of unknown transient signals when prior information about the signal time-bandwidth product and relative bandwidth exists. In these cases, the wavelet-representation-based detector performs better than any other. The structure of the proposed detectors is discussed and its performance is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. >	wavelet transform	Mordechai Frisch;Hagit Messer	1992	IEEE Trans.

Among these methods, the 2q-MUSIC methods, q ges 2, are the most popular. These methods are asymptotically robust to a Gaussian background noise whose spatial coherence is unknown and offer increasing resolution and robustness to modeling errors jointly with an increasing processing capacity as q increases. However, these methods have been mainly developed for arrays with identical sensors only and cannot put up with arrays of diversely polarized sensors in the presence of diversely polarized sources. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to introduce, for arbitrary values of q, q ges 1, three extensions of the 2q-MUSIC method, able to put up with arrays having diversely polarized sensors for diversely polarized sources. This gives rise to the so-called polarization diversity 2q-MUSIC (PD-2q-MUSIC) algorithms. For a given value of q, these algorithms are shown to increase the resolution, the robustness to modeling errors, and the processing capacity of the 2q-MUSIC method in the presence of diversely polarized sources. Besides, some PD-2q-MUSIC algorithms are shown to offer increasing performances with q when resolution in both direction of arrival and polarization is required.	algorithm;coherence (physics);direction finding;direction of arrival;emoticon;image resolution;performance;pixel;polarization (waves);resolution (logic);sensor	Pascal Chevalier;Anne Ferréol;Laurent Albera;Gwénaël Birot	2007	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2007.899367	telecommunications;computer science;antenna;mathematics;statistics	Visualization	50.39351131211039	17.112612708284253	172642

As such model, we consider the multiplicative model with nonnegative signals and noises. In contrast to standard filtering problems, our statement assumes that the distribution and equation of the useful signal are unknown. To solve the nonlinear filtering problem, the idea is to employ a generalized optimal filtering equation with a feature that the optimal estimator is expressed only through characteristics of the observed process. The role of such characteristics in the equation belongs to the logarithmic derivative of the conditional multidimensional density of observations. We find the solution of the equation using nonparametric kernel estimation methods with nonsymmetrical gamma kernel functions defined on the positive semiaxis. Moreover, we establish convergence conditions for the kernel estimator of the logarithmic derivative of the multidimensional density by dependent observations, as well as derive explicit formulas for optimal bandwidths and construct a stable (regularized) filtering estimator.	nonlinear system	Alexander V.

While, in the earlier work, we developed and proposed a competitive minimax approach of minimizing the worst-case mean-squared error (MSE) difference regret criterion, here, we study, in the same spirit, the minimum worst-case MSE ratio regret criterion, namely, the worst-case ratio (rather than difference) between the MSE attainable using a linear estimator, ignorant of the exact signal covariance, and the minimum MSE (MMSE) attainable by optimum linear estimation with a known signal covariance. We present the optimal linear estimator, under this criterion, in two ways: The first is as a solution to a certain semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, and the second is as an expression that is of closed form up to a single parameter whose value can be found by a simple line search procedure. We then show that the linear minimax ratio regret estimator can also be interpreted as the MMSE estimator that minimizes the MSE for a certain choice of signal covariance that depends on the uncertainty region. We demonstrate that in applications, the proposed minimax MSE ratio regret approach may outperform the well-known minimax MSE approach, the minimax MSE difference regret approach, and the """"plug-in"""" approach, where in the latter, one uses the MMSE estimator with an estimated covariance matrix replacing the true unknown covariance."""	additive white gaussian noise;best, worst and average case;continuation;line search;mean squared error;minimax;plug-in (computing);regret (decision theory);semidefinite programming;utility functions on indivisible goods;whole earth 'lectronic link	Yonina C.

One idea for the reliability measure arises from a waterbed effect in DOA estimation. The reliability measure can be obtained from the difference between the maximum and minimum point of cross-correlation. If the calculated reliability measure has a lower value than a predefined threshold, the estimated DOA is regarded as a wrong result and subsequently discarded. Some experiments show that the proposed method can reject perturbed results of the estimated DOA.	acoustic lobing;covox speech thing;cross-correlation;direction of arrival;experiment;institute of electronics, information and communication engineers;kernel density estimation;maxima and minima;sensor	Hyejeong Jeon;Seungil Kim;Lag-Yong Kim;Hee-Youn Lee;Hyunsoo Yoon	2008	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.5.192	econometrics;speech recognition;reliability;mathematics;acoustic source localization;statistics	Robotics	50.10253825645088	7.922879123845158	173979

This is a useful setting for comparing algorithm performance, among other purposes. However, in practical applications a precise value for such a tolerance is rarely known; rather, only some possibly vague idea of the desired quality of the numerical approximation is at hand. This leads us to think of ways to relax the notion of exactly satisfying a tolerance value, in a hopefully profitable way. We give well-known examples where a deterministic relaxation of this notion is applied. Another possibility which we concentrate on is a probabilistic relaxation of the given tolerance. This allows, for instance, derivation of proven bounds on the sample size of certain Monte Carlo methods. We describe this in the context of particular applications.	algorithm;approximation;computational science;iteration;linear programming relaxation;linear system;mathematical optimization;mathematical software;monte carlo method;non-deterministic turing machine;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;probabilistic turing machine;system of linear equations;uncertainty quantification;vagueness	Uri M.

For example , a selection of the results for Q and R, rounded to four decimal places, obtained by RANDGI with corresponding to a symmetric triangular distribution [1] on [0, 2], is as follows:	algol;algorithm;icl;random number generation;significant figures	Les G.

After suitable transformation, the likelihood ratio test statistic is expressed as a sum of independent Gaussian random variables. The precise asymptotic rate at which the tail probability of this sum vanishes is derived by use of Ellis' theorem in conjunction with asymptotic analysis of Toeplitz matrices. As a specific example, a signal composed of a deterministic mean component, a zero-mean stochastic component, and a white-noise background was tested against white noise alone. Results confirm the obvious: for fixed stochastic signal power the rate of error decrease increases as the power in the deterministic mean increases. With higher signal-to-noise values, the probability of error must vanish more quickly. For fixed deterministic mean component, as the stochastic signal power increases there is curious dip in the rate of error decrease; however, as this power is increased, eventually the rate of error decrease increases. >		Randall K.

17521b028626ba665d2f04318a9820ad6f1d96a0	on the expected value of the determinant of random sum of rank-one matrices		We present a simple, yet useful result about the expected value of the determinant of random sum of rank-one matrices. Computing such expectations in general may involve a sum over exponentially many terms. Nevertheless, we show that an interesting and useful class of such expectations that arise in, e.g., D-optimal estimation and random graphs can be computed efficiently via computing a single determinant. 1 Problem Definition • [n] , {1, 2, . . . , n}, and for any finite set W, (W k ) is the set of k-subsets of W. • Suppose we are given a pair of m real n-vectors, {ui}i=1 and {vi}i=1. Define, U , [ u1 u2 · · · um ] V , [ v1 v2 · · · vm ] (1) • Let {πi}i=1 be m independent Bernoulli random variables distributed as, πi ∼ Bern(pi) i ∈ [m] (2) πi ⊥ πj i, j ∈ [m], i 6= j (3) where {pi}i=1 are given.

Note that the naive way of computing this expectation leads to a computationally intractable sum over {0, 1}m. 1 ar X iv :1 70 2. 08 24 7v 2 [ cs .D S] 2 8 Fe b 20 17	bernoulli polynomials;computational complexity theory;field electron emission;random graph;unified model	Kasra Khosoussi	2017	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	39.95174346051644	14.546611730994156	174415

The disturbance is modeled as a complex correlated Gaussian process. The jamming is modeled as a signal belonging to a cone whose axis is the true target signal. Two different approaches are analyzed, based on the adaptive coherent estimator (ACE) and on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), yielding both to a two-block device. The performance of the two detection/classification algorithms are evaluated, analytically, when possible, and by Monte Carlo simulation.	ace;algorithm;ambiguity function;apache axis;cellular automaton;coherence (physics);counter (digital);gaussian process;interference (communication);modulation;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;pearson–anson effect;radar;radio frequency;radio jamming;sensor;signal processing;simulation;tracking system;transmitter	Maria S.

The fading channel is modeled as independent and identically distributed random variables with known realization at the receiver. The optimal estimator at the receiver is the Kalman filter. In contrast to the classical Kalman filter theory, given a random channel, the Kalman gain and the error covariance become random. Then, the probability distribution function of expected estimation error and its outage probability can be chosen for estimation quality assessment. In this paper and in order to get the estimation error outage, we provide means to characterize the stationary probability density function of the random expected estimation error. Furthermore and for the particular case of the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channels, upper and lower bounds for the outage probability are derived that provide insight and simpler means for design purposes. We also show that the bounds are tight for the high SNR regime and that the outage probability decreases linearly with the inverse of the average channel SNR.	downtime;filter design;kalman filter;markov chain;rayleigh fading;scalar processor;signal-to-noise ratio;stationary process;sun outage	Reza Parseh;Kimmo Kansanen	2014	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2014.2360820	fading distribution;econometrics;invariant extended kalman filter;ensemble kalman filter;rayleigh distribution;mathematics;extended kalman filter;channel state information;moving horizon estimation;statistics	ML	50.32542603578661	14.321953958334214	175345

We consider an M/GI/1/n queueing system where the service time probability distribution, slightly different in a certain sense from the exponential distribution, is approximated by that exponential distribution. Continuity theorems are obtained in the form of one or two-sided stochastic inequalities. The paper shows how the bounds of these inequalities are changed if further assumptions, associated with specific properties of the service time distribution (precisely described in the paper), are made. Specifically, some parametric families of service time distributions are discussed, and the paper establishes uniform estimates (given for all possible values of the parameter) and local estimates (where the parameter is fixed and takes only the given value). The analysis of the paper is based on the level crossing approach and some characterization properties of the exponential distribution.	approximation algorithm;queueing theory;scott continuity;time complexity	Vyacheslav M.

This result is then extended to the discrete case and the associated problems such as the sampling effects are examined. Using the discrete optimum recognition model, design parameters are then developed. Among these are the critical sampling matrix which provides a lower bound for the sampling rates and the rate matrix which provides information on the classification error. Algorithms such as the two-dimensional fast Fourier transform are then employed to calculate these discrete optimum model design parameters. Based on this theoretical background a machine print recognition problem is presented. The design parameters are computed and the discrete optimum system is simulated on the digital computer. Finally some actual machine print data is recognized and the results are analyzed.	computer;detection theory;fast fourier transform;sampling (signal processing);statistical model	Thomas E. Milson;K.

Here $g:[0,\infty)\rightarrow[0,1]$ satisfies the conditions of rotational invariance, non-increasing monotonicity, integral boundedness and $g(x)=o(\frac{1}{x^{2}\log^{2}x})$; further, $r_{\rho}=\sqrt{\frac{\log\rho+b}{C\rho}}$ where $C=\int_{\Re^{2}}g(\Vert \boldsymbol{x}\Vert)d\boldsymbol{x}$ and $b$ is a constant. Denote the above network by\textmd{}$\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{X}_{\rho},g_{r_{\rho}},A)$. We show that as $\rho\rightarrow\infty$, asymptotically almost surely a) there is no component in $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{X}_{\rho},g_{r_{\rho}},A)$ of fixed and finite order $k>1$; b) the number of components with an unbounded order is one. Therefore as $\rho\rightarrow\infty$, the network asymptotically almost surely contains a unique unbounded component and isolated nodes only; a sufficient condition for $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{X}_{\rho},g_{r_{\rho}},A)$ to be asymptotically almost surely connected is that there is no isolated node in the network.{\normalsize{}}The contribution of these results, together with results in a companion paper on the asymptotic distribution of isolated nodes in \textmd{\normalsize $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{X}_{\rho},g_{r_{\rho}},A)$}, is to expand recent results obtained for connectivity of random geometric graphs from the unit disk model to the more generic and more practical random connection model.	emergence;emoticon;euclidean distance;random geometric graph	Guoqiang Mao;Brian D.

Approximate expressions for the likelihood function, the MAP estimator, and the MMSE estimator that becomes increasingly accurate as the per-unit-time density of superimposed filter responses becomes small are obtained. The optimal MAP estimator takes the form of a cascade of linear and memoryless nonlinear components. For smooth point process intensities, the performance of the MAP estimator is studied via local bias and local variance. A rate distortion type lower bound on the MSE of any estimator of time delay is then derived by identification of a communications channel that accounts for the mapping from time delay to observation process. Results of numerical studies of estimator performance are presented. Based on the examples considered it is concluded: (1) the small-error MSE of the nonlinear MAP estimator can be significantly better than the small-error MSE of the optimal linear estimator: (2) the rate distortion lower bound can be significantly tighter than the Poisson limited bounds determined in previous studies. >		Alfred O.

This paper presents a new method to address these issues by bringing in the notion of vector-space formulation of symbolic systems in the setting of PFSA. In this context, a link is established between the formal language theory and functional analysis by defining an inner product space over a class of stochastic regular languages, represented by PFSA models that are constructed from finite-length symbol sequences. The norm induced by the inner product is interpreted as a measure of the information contained in the respective PFSA. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the computational steps in the proposed method and to demonstrate model order reduction via orthogonal projection from a general Hilbert space of PFSA onto a (closed) Markov subspace that belongs to a class of shifts of finite type. These concepts are validated by analyzing time series of ultrasonic signals, collected from an experimental apparatus, for fatigue damage detection in polycrystalline alloys. & 2013 Elsevier B.V.

By exploring the solution of a related set of equations, using suitable generalized inverses of the Markovian kernel I – P, where P is the transition matrix of a finite irreducible Markov chain, we are able to derive elegant new results for finding the mean first passage times. As a by-product we derive the stationary distribution of the Markov chain without the necessity of any further computational procedures. Standard techniques in the literature, using for example Kemeny and Snell’s fundamental matrix Z, require the initial derivation of the stationary distribution followed by the computation of Z, the inverse I – P + eπ where e = (1, 1, ...,1) and π is the stationary probability vector. The procedures of this paper involve only the derivation of the inverse of a matrix of simple structure, based upon known characteristics of the Markov chain together with simple elementary vectors. No prior computations are required. Various possible families of matrices are explored leading to different related procedures.	computation;fundamental matrix (computer vision);irreducibility;linear equation;markov chain;stationary process;stochastic matrix	Jeffrey J.

The information rate 9 carried by these binary samples is investigated. It is shown by constructing a specific nonstatiomuy, bounded, bandlimited process, the real zeros of which are independent and ldentkdly distributed, isdsted, and lying in dirrerent Nyquist intervals, that .Y= log,(n + 1) (bib per Nyquist interval) is achievable.

By exploiting the constraints imposed on the aotoeorrelation function of a StatiOMly sign (bilevel) process with a given average transition rate, the latter expression is shown also to yield M upper bound on the achievable values of 9. The logarithmic behavior with n ( r > 1) is due to the high correlation between the oversampled binary samples, and it is established that this trend is also achievable with stationary sign processes. This model may be used to gain insight into the e&ct of tinite resolution on the information (in Shannon's sense) conveyed by the sign of a bandlimited process, and also to assess the limiting performance of certaii ovenampling-based communication systems.	bandlimiting;nyquist rate;oversampling;sampling (signal processing);shannon (unit);stationary process	Shlomo Shamai	1994	IEEE Trans.

These processes exhibit asymptotic dependence meaning that the large values of the process can occur simultaneously over space. Recently, inverted max-stable processes have been proposed as an important new class for spatial extremes which are in the domain of attraction of a spatially independent max-stable process but instead they cover the broad class of asymptotic independence. To study the extreme values of such processes we use the conditioned approach to multivariate extremes that characterises the limiting distribution of appropriately normalised random vectors given that at least one of their components is large. The current statistical methods for the conditioned approach are based on a canonical parametric family of location and scale norming functions. We study broad classes of inverted max-stable processes containing processes linked to the widely studied max-stable models of Brown-Resnick and extremal-t, and identify conditions for the normalisations to either belong to the canonical family or not. Despite such differences at an asymptotic level, we show that at practical levels, the canonical model can approximate well the true conditional distributions.

The classic model is given in terms of a risk reserve, Z(t), that increases according to a deterministic process (premiums) and decreases according to a compound Poisson process (claims). An integrodifferential backward Kolmogorov equation is derived for the probability of surviving through time t. Exact solutions for an exponential claims distribution are derived when the premiums are modeled as either constant over time, or linearly dependent on the size of the reserve. These complicated exact solutions are analyzed asymptotically for three fundamental regions in parameter space and for various regions in the (z,t) plane, where z Z(0).

Most of these have focused on the discrete setting, even though in many applications the input signal is continuous and naive discretization significantly worsens the sparsity level. We present an algorithm for robustly computing sparse Fourier transforms in the continuous setting. Let x*(t) = x(t)+g(t), where x* has a k-sparse Fourier transform and g is an arbitrary noise term. Given sample access to x(t) for some duration T, we show how to find a k-Fourier-sparse reconstruction x'(t) with 1/T ∫0T|x'(t) - x(t)|2dt ≲ 1/T∫0T|g(t)|2dt. The sample complexity is linear in k and logarithmic in the signal-to-noise ratio and the frequency resolution. Previous results with similar sample complexities could not tolerate an infinitesimal amount of i.i.d. Gaussian noise, and even algorithms with higher sample complexities increased the noise by a polynomial factor. We also give new results for how precisely the individual frequencies of x* can be recovered.	algorithm;discretization;polynomial;sample complexity;signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix;time complexity	Eric Price;Zhao Song	2015	2015 IEEE 56th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science	10.1109/FOCS.2015.42	fourier transform;sine and cosine transforms;mathematical optimization;discrete-time fourier transform;harmonic wavelet transform;short-time fourier transform;computer science;fractional fourier transform;machine learning;discrete fourier transform;fourier inversion theorem;discrete fourier series;mathematics;spectral density estimation;discrete fourier transform;fourier analysis;least-squares spectral analysis;programming language;signal-to-noise ratio;non-uniform discrete fourier transform;phase correlation;approximation algorithm;statistics;fourier transform on finite groups;robustness	Theory	53.10768488393096	17.52111672468373	177371

Especially it is proved that the variance $\vec{E} (H_n - \vec{E} H_n)^2$ and all centralized moments are bounded. These kinds of concentration properties are already known for tries and binary search trees. However, for digital search trees one expects much more, namely that the height is (asymptotically) concentrated at (at most) two levels. This conjecture – sometimes called Kesten's conjecture – remains unsolved but the present results might be a first step towards its resolution.	centralized computing;resolution (logic);search tree	Michael Drmota	2002	Acta Informatica	10.1007/s236-002-8034-5	generating function;combinatorics;height;binary search tree;binary tree;computer science;calculus;mathematics;poisson distribution;variance;search tree;programming language;bernoulli's principle;statistics	Theory	40.10528322874715	14.799735275644277	177531
df30db99f679e370062332170a425f0ed1b6885f	an improved transformation between hill and metric conditional pseudoentropy		HILL Entropy and Metric Entropy are generalizations of the information-theoretic notion of min-entropy to the setting where an adversary is computationally bounded. The notion of HILL Entropy appeared in the breakthrough construction of a PRG from any one-way function, and has become the most important and most widely used definition of computational entropy. In turn, Metric Entropy which is defined as a relaxation of HILL Entropy, has been proven to be much easier to handle, in particular in the context of computational generalizations of the Dense Model Theorem. Fortunately, Metric Entropy can be converted, with some loss in quality, to HILL Entropy as shown by Barak, Shaltiel and Wigderson. In this paper we improve their result, slightly reducing the loss in quality of entropy. Interestingly, our bound is independent of size of the probability space in comparison to the result of Barak et al. Our approach is based on the theory of convex approximation in L-spaces.	adversary (cryptography);angular defect;approximation;conditional entropy;entropy (information theory);information theory;linear programming relaxation;maxima and minima;measure-preserving dynamical system;one-way function;programming research group	Maciej Skorski	2014	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		statistics;discrete mathematics;regular polygon;generalization;mathematics;adversary;bounded function	Theory	45.71634838161254	16.762837893222475	177885

This observation not only explains the remarkable properties of lacunary trigonometric series, but also provides a powerful tool in many areas of analysis, such the theory of orthogonal series and Banach space theory. In contrast to i.i.d. sequences, however, the probabilistic structure of lacunary sequences is not permutation-invariant and the analytic properties of such sequences can change after rearrangement. In a previous paper we showed that permutation-invariance of subsequences of the trigonometric system and related function systems is connected with Diophantine properties of the index sequence. In this paper we will study permutation-invariance of subsequences of general r.v. sequences. AMS 2000 Subject classification. Primary 42A55, 42A61, 60F05, 60G09.	vhdl-ams	István Berkes;Robert F.

fd1fddb98aeff8ca90c005aeb5dabd971536fc73	diffeomorphic random sampling using optimal information transport		In this article we explore an algorithm for diffeomorphic random sampling of nonuniform probability distributions on Riemannian manifolds. The algorithm is based on optimal information transport (OIT)—an analogue of optimal mass transport (OMT). Our framework uses the deep geometric connections between the Fisher-Rao metric on the space of probability densities and the right-invariant information metric on the group of diffeomorphisms. The resulting sampling algorithm is a promising alternative to OMT, in particular as our formulation is semi-explicit, free of the nonlinear Monge–Ampere equation. Compared to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, we expect our algorithm to stand up well when a large number of samples from a low dimensional nonuniform distribution is needed.

Using the Markov property, we first establish a decomposition of the relative entropy between the measures on observation path space associated to different initial conditions. Using this decomposition, it is shown that the relative entropy of the optimal filter relative to an incorrectly initialized filter is a positive supermartingale. By applying the decomposition to signals observed in additive, white noise, a relative entropy bound is obtained on the integrated, expected, mean square difference between the optimal and incorrectly initialized estimates of the observation function.	kullback–leibler divergence;markov property	J.

The asymptotic distribution of the estimates is derived and used to provide a means of discrimination between estimates that are associated with different local maxima of the log-likelihood function.

bfc147ec004450927b162ec3751456472d59698e	quantum tomography of semi-algebraic sets with constrained measurements		We analyse quantum state tomography in scenarios where measurements and states are both constrained. States are assumed to live in a semi-algebraic subset of state space and measurements are supposed to be rank-one POVMs, possibly with additional constraints. Specifically, we consider sets of von Neumann measurements and sets of local observables. We provide upper bounds on the minimal number of measurement settings or outcomes that are required for discriminating all states within the given set. The bounds exploit tools from real algebraic geometry and lead to generic results that do not only show the existence of good measurements but guarantee that almost all measurements with the same dimension characteristic perform equally well. In particular, we show that on an n-dimensional Hilbert space any two states of a semialgebraic subset can be discriminated by k generic von Neumann measurements if k(n− 1) is larger than twice the dimension of the subset. In case the subset is given by states of rank at most r, we show that k generic von Neumann measurements suffice to discriminate any two states provided that k(n − 1) > 4r(n − r) − 2. Furthermore, we obtain corresponding results for low-rank matrix recovery of hermitian matrices and the phase retrieval problem.	hilbert space;linear algebra;observable;phase retrieval;quantum state;quantum tomography;semiconductor industry;state space	Michael Kech;Michael M.

In composite hypothesis testing, unlike in simple hypothesis testing, the probability function of the observed data, given the hypothesis, is uncertain as it depends on the unknown value of some parameter. The proposed approach is to minimize the worst case ratio between the probability of error of a decision rule that is independent of the unknown parameters and the minimum probability of error attainable given the parameters. The principal solution to this minimax problem is presented and the resulting decision rule is discussed. Since the exact solution is, in general, hard to find, anda fortiori hard to implement, an approximation method that yields an asymptotically minimax decision rule is proposed. Finally, a variety of potential application areas are provided in signal processing and communications with special emphasis on universal decoding.	approximation;best, worst and average case;minimax;signal processing	Meir Feder;Neri Merhav	2002	IEEE Trans.

We highlight that in low dimensions consensus is reached through a coarsening process that requires less cognitive effort of the agents, with respect to the mean-field case, but takes longer to complete. In one dimension, the dynamics of the boundaries is mapped onto a truncated Markov process from which we analytically computed the diffusion coefficient.

This paper aims at extending the field of possible applications of factor graphs to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics. The starting point is the principle of least action (more precisely, the principle of stationary action). The resulting factor graphs require a new message-passing algorithm that we call the stationary-sum algorithm. As it turns out, some of the properties of this algorithm are equivalent to Liouville's theorem. Moreover, duality results for factor graphs allow to easily derive Noether's theorem. We also discuss connections and differences to Kalman filtering.	action potential;algorithm;artificial intelligence;coding theory;factor graph;graphical model;kalman filter;lagrangian (field theory);maxima and minima;message passing;noether's theorem;principle of least action;signal processing;stationary process	Pascal O.

The underlying assumption is that the system’s global mission can be accomplished even if only one of the estimators achieves satisfactory performance. The notion of altruism motivates a new definition of cooperative estimation optimality that generalizes the common definition of minimum mean square error optimality. Fundamental equations are derived for two types of altruistic cooperative estimation problems, corresponding to heterarchical and hierarchical setups. Although these equations are hard to solve in the general case, their solution in the Gaussian case is straightforward and only entails the largest eigenvalue of the conditional covariance matrix and its corresponding eigenvector. Moreover, in that case the performance improvement of the two altruistic cooperative estimation techniques over the conventional (egoistic) estimation approach is shown to depend on the problem’s dimensionality and statistical distribution. In particular, the performance improvement grows with the dispersion of the spectrum of the conditional covariance matrix, rendering the new estimation approach especially appealing in ill-conditioned problems. The performance of the new approach is demonstrated using a numerical simulation study.	computer simulation;condition number;mean squared error	Nitai Stein;Yaakov Oshman	2017	CoRR		altruism;welfare economics;economics	Robotics	50.31938954369	9.072840617685552	180090

The optimal hedging problem is formulated as follows: Find optimal smooth functions of individual options to minimize the mean square error from the payoff of down-and-out basket option. For solving the problem, we first express the necessary and sufficient condition in terms of linear equations regarding conditional expectations of basket barrier options. Based on the Brownian bridge decomposition and the Independence Lemma, we show that the computations involving conditional expectations of basket barrier options may be reduced to those of unconditional expectations. This computation involves multiple integrations in general, but is usually executed efficiently based on the standard Monte Carlo method by generating independent Gaussian random numbers. Finally, we demonstrate numerical experiments to illustrate our proposed methodology.	additive model;brownian motion;computation;experiment;linear equation;mean squared error;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;path dependence	Yuji Yamada	2015	2015 54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2015.7402375	mathematical optimization;mathematics;mathematical economics;matrix decomposition	Robotics	40.49738411675722	4.876909174056532	180104

In this letter, we identify that the impact of a random phase mismatch on the imaging problem can come to a scale-down factor on the amplitude of the MIMO point spread function. We thereby establish the conditions of successful support recovery and the performance measure for the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm for the involved problem, both of which are functions of the scale-down factor. Meanwhile, sparse imaging via expectation-maximization (SIEM) is proposed to alleviate OMP performance loss in the face of a phase mismatch. Numerical results corroborate the analysis and illustrate the effectiveness of the SIEM algorithm.	compressed sensing;expectation–maximization algorithm;mimo;matching pursuit;numerical method;openmp;security information and event management;sparse matrix;transmitter	Li Ding;Weidong Chen	2015	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2014.2363110	medical imaging;transmitter;telecommunications;control theory;radar imaging;remote sensing	Vision	50.66001165283002	7.937399357311734	180346

The paper deals with the case of infinite K. It turns out that for countably-supported prior distribution ρ with heavy tails the error term can be of the order of N α with α ∈ − 1 2 , 0 , i.e., the convergence can be anomalously slow. The maximal possible α for a given ρ is determined in terms of entropy-like family of functionals. Our approach is based on the well-known connection between the behavior of the maximal variation of measure-valued martingales and asymptotic properties of repeated games with incomplete information.	entropy (information theory);expanded memory;maximal set;tails;whole earth 'lectronic link	Fedor Sandomirskiy	2014	Int.

Most of the common indoor localization methods are based on estimating one or more location-dependent signal parameters like TOA, AOA or RSS. However, some difficulties and challenges caused by the complex scenarios within a closed space significantly limit the applicability of those existing approaches in an indoor assistive environment, such as the well-known multipath effect. In this paper, we develop a new one-stage localization method based on spatial sparsity of the x-y plane. In this method, we directly estimate the location of the emitter without going through the intermediate stage of TOA or signal strength estimation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method using Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the proposed method is (i) very accurate even with a small number of sensors and (ii) very effective in addressing the multi-path issues.	ataxia, early-onset, with oculomotor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia;accident prevention;amiga reflections;angle of arrival;arabic numeral 0;assistive technology;behavior;computer performance;elegant degradation;emitter device component;emoticon;estimated;lambert's cosine law;leucaena pulverulenta;monte carlo method;multipath propagation;numerous;patients;rss;simulation;sparse matrix;time of arrival;whole earth 'lectronic link;disease transmission;sensor (device)	Mohammad Pourhomayoun;Zhanpeng Jin;Mark L.

The binary output reports the occurrence of a certain state (versus any other state) in the Markov chain. The transition matrix of the Markov chain depends on a control vector which is to be chosen to minimize a discounted infinite-horizon cost function. The information provided for decision making is the entire history of the binary output which presents an incomplete knowledge of the Markov chain and, as a consequence, leads to a stochastic control problem with partial observations. The solution to such a problem is a control policy consisting of two components: an estimator to derive the posterior probability distribution of the Markov chain from the observation set, and a nonlinear control law to map this estimate into the control vector. This paper introduces a nonlinear state-space representation for the estimator, develops analytical expressions for the control law, and presents numerical methods for efficient computation of the optimal control. Application of these results to optimal management of a class of inventory systems is discussed, and the performance of optimal control for this application is examined by numerical simulations.	computation;hidden markov model;kleene's recursion theorem;loss function;nonlinear system;numerical method;observable;optimal control;rewrite (programming);social inequality;state-space representation;stochastic control;stochastic matrix;the matrix	Arash Komaee;Alain Bensoussan	2014	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2013.2278137	inventory control;markov decision process;probability distribution;markov chain;mathematical optimization;maximum-entropy markov model;markov kernel;stock control;discrete phase-type distribution;optimal control;partially observable markov decision process;markov chain monte carlo;markov property;numerical analysis;continuous-time markov chain;examples of markov chains;balance equation;machine learning;hidden semi-markov model;control theory;mathematics;markov renewal process;additive markov chain;markov process;markov chain mixing time;markov model;absorbing markov chain;hidden markov model;statistics;variable-order markov model	Robotics	39.21446567876447	4.92579197246646	180588

Xi, i = 1,. . . , n, be discrete random variables, and Xi be a set variable corresponding to Xi. Define the universal set to be U ; = IXi and let S be the U-field generated by (Xi, i = 1,. . . , n}. It is shown that Shannon’s information measures on the random variables Xi, i = 1; .,n, constitute a unique measure p* on F, which is called the I-Measure. In other words, the Shannon information measure (i.e., Shannon’s information measures as a whole) is a measure on S, thus establishing the analogy between information theory and set theory. Therefore each information theoretic operation can formally be viewed as a set theoretic operation, and vice versa. This point of view, which we believe is of fundamental importance, has apparently been overlooked in the past by information theorists. As a consequence the I-Diagram is introduced, which is a geometrical representation of the relationship among the information measures. The I-Diagram is analogous to the Venn Diagram in set theory. The use of the I-Diagram is discussed; some applications of which reveal results that may otherwise be difficult to discover. A formula is also derived for the value of the I-Measure of the atoms of S and its sub-afields generated by some subsets of the basic set variables.	diagram;entropy (information theory);information theory;microsoft outlook for mac;set theory;shannon (unit)	Raymond W.

This method may be used for approximation of entropy, inverse moments, and some statistics of discrete random variables useful in analysis of some randomized algorithms. Our approach is based on some variant of the Delta Method of Moments. We formulate a general result for an arbitrary distribution and next we show its specific extension to random variables which are sums of identically distributed independent random variables. Our method simplifies previous proofs of results of several authors and can be automated to a large extend. We apply our method to the binomial, negative binomial, Poisson and hypergeometric distribution. We extend the class of function for which our method is applicable for some subclass of exponential functions and double exponential function for some cases.	approximation;entropy (information theory);exponential time hypothesis;randomized algorithm;time complexity	Jacek Cichon;Zbigniew Golebiewski;Marcin Kardas;Marek Klonowski	2013		10.1137/1.9781611973037.11	independent and identically distributed random variables;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;convergence of random variables;central limit theorem;sum of normally distributed random variables;random function;stochastic simulation;mathematics;factorial moment;taylor expansions for the moments of functions of random variables;moment-generating function;statistics	Theory	42.6072015889204	14.012144326799055	181329

The case where K gives rise to an orthogonal projection of L2( ) onto a nite{dimensional subspace is studied here in detail. The determinantal instance of this special case has a substantial literature because of its role in several problems in mathematical physics, particularly as the distribution of eigenvalues for various models of random matrices. The representation theory of the symmetric group is used to compute the normalisation constant and identify the kth{order marginal densities for 1 k n as linear combinations of analogously de ned immanantal densities.

900cf63c42f618b8f4bba51ce5d113ec0619c774	aperiodic geometry design for doa estimation of broadband sources using compressive sensing		Abstract Antenna arrays used in Compressive Sensing (CS) based algorithms are generated randomly to minimize mutual coherence. This scheme, although good for compressive sensing, suffers from practical limitations. Random sampling of antenna aperture is impractical. Rectangular arrays, although uniform, suffer from poor performance when used in CS algorithms. It is particularly ill suited to algorithms designed to estimate DOA of broadband sources, because of the introduction of grating lobes. Aperiodic arrays offer some advantages in the CS scenario. The aperiodic geometries based on Penrose and Danzer tiling are inherently sparse as they utilize a fewer number of sensors as compared to the regular geometries. Based on minimization of mutual coherence, this paper develops a novel optimization scheme, that can generate sparse array geometries offering improved performance for CS algorithms. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to design aperiodic arrays that perform much better than rectangular arrays by using a simple disturbance optimization scheme, that can be applied to other aperiodic geometries as well. A greedy MMV based compressive sensing algorithm, SOMP, is used to evaluate the performance of a number of geometries. Two geometries have been identified that perform better than all other geometries studied, including the random-sampling based geometries.	compressed sensing;direction of arrival;shape optimization	Zeeshan Asghar Sayed;Boon Poh Ng	2019	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2018.09.026	compressed sensing;sparse array;control theory;minification;mutual coherence;aperiodic graph;mathematics;algorithm;antenna aperture;broadband;grating	Robotics	50.713021464174304	7.322529188688471	182439

While several approximation techniques have been proposed to alleviate the curse of dimensionality associated with dynamic programming, these techniques cannot handle larger, more realistic systems. We present a scalable method that uses Fourier transforms to compute an underapproximation of the reach-avoid probability for systems with disturbances with arbitrary probability densities. We characterize sufficient conditions for Borel-measurability of the value function. We exploit fixed control sequences parameterized by the initial condition (an open-loop control policy) to generate the underapproximation. For Gaussian disturbances, the underapproximation can be obtained using existing efficient algorithms by solving a convex optimization problem. Our approach produces non-trivial lower bounds and is demonstrated on a 40-D chain of integrators.	algorithm;approximation;bellman equation;convex optimization;curse of dimensionality;dynamic programming;initial condition;linear system;linear time-invariant theory;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;reachability;scalability	Abraham P.

The detection procedure is a likelihood ratio processor followed by a soft limiter. Maximum likelihood estimation of the delay parameter is used in the linear region of the soft limiter and the instants of saturation and desaturation are employed when the upper level of the soft limiter is crossed. The paper presents results for this estimator and compares them with the Cramer-Rao lower bound. Applications to Radar and Sonar are briefly discussed.		A. R.

It is sub-additive with respect to the union of hypergraphs. In case of simple graphs, exact additivity for the entropy of a graph and its complement with respect to every probability distribution on the vertex set gives a characterization of perfect graphs. Here we investigate uniform hypergraphs with an analoguous behaviour of their entropy. The main result is the characterization of 3-uniform hypergraphs having this entropy splitting property. It is also shown that for k 4 no non-trivial k-uniform hypergraph has this property. 1996 Academic Press, Inc.	graph (discrete mathematics);rényi entropy;theory;utility functions on indivisible goods;vertex (graph theory)	Gábor Simonyi	1996	J.

Using all the microphones at once is impractical because of the amount of data generated. Instead, we choose a subset of D microphones to be active. Specifically, we wish to find the set of D microphones that minimizes the largest interference gain at multiple frequencies while monitoring a target of interest. A direct, combinatorial approach - testing all N choose D subsets of microphones - is impractical because of the problem size. Instead, we use a convex optimization technique that induces sparsity through a l1-penalty to determine which subset of microphones to use. We test the robustness of the our solution through simulated annealing and compare its performance against a classical beamformer which maximizes SNR. Since switching from a subset of D microphones to another subset of D microphones at every sample is possible, we construct a space-time-frequency sampling scheme that achieves near optimal performance.	acoustic cryptanalysis;analysis of algorithms;beamforming;convex optimization;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;microphone;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulated annealing;sparse matrix	Yenming M.

This paper deals with the situation in which the random bits are neither independent nor unbiased, but are nearly so. We show that, under suitable assumptions concerning the automaton, if the the difference between the entropy of the first n bits and n converges to a constant exponentially fast, then the change in the expected number of acceptances also converges to a constan texponentially fast. We illustrate this result with a variety of examples in which numbers follo wing the reciprocal distribution, which governs the significands of floating-point numbers, are recoded in the execution of various multiplication algorithms.	automaton;finite-state machine	Nicholas Pippenger	2002		10.1007/3-540-36136-7_56	entropy;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;operating system;machine learning;mathematics;distributed computing;finite-state machine;algorithm;statistics	Logic	40.344915329748865	11.92839847807788	184536

We augment the standard computer arithmetic operations and the interval arithmetic approach to include probability distribution variable (PDV) as a basic data type. Probability distribution variable is a random variable that is usually characterized by generalized probabilistic discretization. The correlations or dependencies between PDVs that arise in a computation are automatically calculated and tracked. These correlations are used by the computer arithmetic rules to achieve the convergent approximation of the probability distribution function of a PDV and to guarantee that the derived bounds include the true solution. In many calculations, the calculated uncertainty bounds for PDVs are much tighter than they would have been had the dependencies been ignored. We describe the new PDV Arithmetic and verify the effectiveness of the approach to account for the creation and propagation of uncertainties in a computer program due to uncertainties in the initial data.

In this letter, we introduce a new method for bearing-range estimation, which extends classical subspace-based bearing estimators to a curved wavefront context. The bearing estimation is provided by a one-dimensional procedure, and ranges are simply analytically deduced from the bearing estimates. The proposed approach is illustrated by the introduction of the music curved wavefront (MCW) algorithm.	algorithm;array processing;direction of arrival	Eric Boyer;Anne Ferréol;Pascal Larzabal	2005	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2005.847885	speech recognition;angle of arrival;mathematics;direction of arrival;sensor array;statistics;satisfiability	Robotics	53.574763434470036	9.123503555143126	185043
17452f9ef4b39d2f1f91d3039b36b1f5e2c48e3b	low complexity moving target parameter estimation for mimo radar using 2d-fft	cramer rao lower bound;spatial location;doppler;mimo radar;article;reflection coefficient	In multiple-input multiple-output radar, to localize a target and estimate its reflection coefficient, a given cost function is usually optimized over a grid of points. The performance of such algorithms is directly affected by the grid resolution. Increasing the number of grid points enhances the resolution of the estimator but also increases its computational complexity exponentially. In this paper, two reduced complexity algorithms are derived based on Capon and amplitude and phase estimation (APES) to estimate the reflection coefficient, angular location, and Doppler shift of multiple moving targets. By exploiting the structure of the terms, the cost function is brought into a form that allows us to apply the two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) and reduce the computational complexity of estimation. Using low resolution 2D-FFT, the proposed algorithm identifies suboptimal estimates and feeds them as initial points to the derived Newton gradient algorithm. In contrast to the grid-based search algorithms, the proposed algorithm can optimally estimate on- and off-the-grid targets in very low computational complexity. A new APES cost function with better estimation performance is also discussed. Generalized expressions of the Cramér–Rao lower bound are derived to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm.	angularjs;computational complexity theory;doppler effect;estimation theory;fast fourier transform;gradient;image resolution;loss function;mimo;newton;newton's method;quantum phase estimation algorithm;radar;reflection coefficient;search algorithm	Seifallah Jardak;Sajid Ahmed;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2017	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2017.2716910	continuous-wave radar;electronic engineering;telecommunications;statistics	Robotics	50.10055028504627	4.995964661705253	185489
dd78fd784bde752ff8a9b48a92e1093e5bfd794c	robust decision design using a distance criterion	signal detection	An alternate formulation of the robust hypothesis testing problem is considered in which robustness is defined in terms of a maximin game with a statistical distance criterion as a payoff function. This distance criterion, which is a generalized version of signal-to-noise ratio, offers advantages over traditional error probability or risk criteria in this problem because of the greater tractability of the distance measure. Within this framework, a design procedure is developed which applies to a more general class of problems than do earlier robustness results based on risks. Furthermore, it is shown for the general case that when a decision rule exists that is robust in terms of risk, the same decision rule will be robust in terms of distance, a fact which supports the use of the latter criterion.

In practice, the relationships of interest may not be directly observable, or may be observed through a noisy mechanism. The effects of imperfect observations add another layer of difficulty to the detection problem, beyond the effects of typical random fluctuations in the background graph. This paper analyzes the impact on detection performance of several error and corruption mechanisms for graph data. In relatively simple scenarios, the change in signal and noise power is analyzed, and this is demonstrated empirically in more complicated models. It is shown that, with enough side information, it is possible to fully recover performance equivalent to working with uncorrupted data using a Bayesian approach, and a simpler cost-optimization approach is shown to provide a substantial benefit as well.	detection theory;entity;mathematical optimization;noise power;observable	Benjamin A.

In such a context, adaptive processing based on an estimated orthogonal projector onto the clutter subspace (instead of an estimated covariance matrix) requires less samples than classical methods. The clutter subspace estimate is usually derived from the eigenvalue decomposition of a covariance matrix estimate. However, it has been previously shown that a direct maximum likelihood estimator of the clutter subspace projector can be obtained for the considered context. In this paper, we derive two algorithms based on the block majorization-minimization framework to reach this estimator. These algorithms are shown to be computationally faster than the state of the art, with guaranteed convergence. Finally, the performance of the related estimators is illustrated on realistic Space Time Adaptive Processing for airborne radar simulations.	airborne ranger;algorithm;clutter;estimation theory;multilinear subspace learning;radar;simulation;space-time adaptive processing;video projector	Ying Sun;Arnaud Breloy;Prabhu Babu;Daniel Pérez Palomar;Frédéric Pascal;Guillaume Ginolhac	2016	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2015.2512535	estimation of covariance matrices;econometrics;mathematical optimization;constant false alarm rate;mathematics;statistics	ML	51.729527832662825	9.246960780462489	186514

The underlying Markov process is assumed to have a stochastic differential driven by Wiener processes and a marked point process. The model for the short rate thus falls within the category of hidden Markov models. For this model we look at the bond pricing problem. In order to obtain more concrete results we introduce the notion of a semi-affine term structure and give sufficient conditions for the existence of such a term structure. For a special case, when the underlying process is a Markov chain with only two states, we obtain a closed form expression for bond prices. Furthermore we consider the pricing problem when the modulating process can not be directly observed. It turns out that pricing in this context may be viewed as a filtering problem.	content-control software;hidden markov model;markov chain;modulation;point process;semiconductor industry;short-rate model	Camilla Landén	2000	Finance and Stochastics	10.1007/PL00013526	financial economics;time reversibility;econometrics;markov chain;markov kernel;bond market;economics;partially observable markov decision process;affine term structure model;markov property;continuous-time markov chain;balance equation;hidden semi-markov model;finance;mathematics;markov renewal process;additive markov chain;markov process;markov chain mixing time;markov model;mathematical economics;yield curve;hidden markov model;statistics;variable-order markov model	ML	43.39845773389128	11.681462978481129	186635

The approach presented here builds up on the IQML algorithm suggested by Bresler and Macovski for the case of narrowband DOA estimation. It is shown that the concept of ARMA model for the observed data vector for the narrowband case can be generalized to model an appropriately stacked, space-time data vector obtained by combining the spacetime samples. The coefficients of the corresponding 2-D predictor polynomial can be used to represent the null subspace of the wideband array steering matrix, and rooting of the polynomial at each frequency, separately, gives the DOA estimates. These separate estimates at multiple frequencies are combined into a single DOA estimate in a least squares sense. This leads to the formulation of an IQML-like procedure for the spatial parameter estimation of wideband sources. Like its narrowband counterpart, the proposed approach is applicable to both noncoherent and coherent sources. The performance of the proposed method is studied via extensive computer simulations and by comparison with the CR bounds.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;coefficient;coherence (physics);computer simulation;data point;direction of arrival;estimation theory;kernel (linear algebra);kerrison predictor;least squares;norm (social);open-source software;polynomial	M.

Gunji, S. Toyoda, Biosystem 38 (1996) 127-133), that is a new approach for complex systems. Hyper-dilation comprises a measurement problem hidden in any formal system. In hyper-dilation, the measurement process is expressed as the interface between an infinite lattice, which is an infinite loop of a rule, and a finite lattice, which is a tree structure of a rule. Hyper-dilation shows two intrinsic properties, one is degeneracy of a Cantor set in return map, and the other is generation of 1/f noise. We present various versions of hyper-dilation and suggest that to generate 1/f noise, it is required that the rules of the system are changed through a coherent process and that the system is closed for information. From these two properties of hyper-dilation, we discuss that the degeneracy is regarded as the model of emergence of a new hierarchy, and in hyper-dilation, actually we show the motion of a system that can be regarded as the appearance of a new hierarchy.	dilation (morphology);hyper-heuristic;povm	Shin'ichi Toyoda;Yukio-Pegio Gunji	1999	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/S0096-3003(98)10063-2	stochastic process;measurement problem;cantor set;dynamical system;calculus;interface;lattice;mathematics;tree structure;computational complexity theory;algorithm;quantum mechanics;statistics;algebra	ECom	40.85043980540456	9.108292679975278	186999

We derive the general expressions of the expectation and variance of the POC functions. Relationships between the POC functions and the phase spectrum differences are formulated.

By considering the azimuth and elevation angles as the parameters of interest, a manifold surface is formed embedded in a multidimensional complex space. Initially, this surface is investigated by establishing a number of differential geometry parameters associated with the array manifold. Then, the concept of developmentis proposed for mapping manifold surfaces (embedded in a multidimensional complex space) on the real 2-D parameter plane. The proposed mapping preserves certain differential geometry characteristics of the manifold surface and provides a simplified representation for the analysis. The potential benefits of this mapping, as well as of the proposed parameters, are demonstrated in the analysis of 3-D and planar arrays of omnidirectional sensors and in a number of potential applications, varying from array design to handling the array ambiguity problem.	complex quadratic polynomial;embedded system;nonlinear system;sensor	Athanassios Manikas;Adham Sleiman;Ioannis Dacos	2001	IEEE Trans.

Two types of source transmissions are considered: 1) single signal transmission (SST), and 2) dual signal transmission (DST). The model is given in terms of several parameters, including the wave direction of arrival (DOA) and state of polarization. A compact expression is derived for the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) on the estimation errors of these parameters for the multisource multi-vector-sensor model. Quality measures including mean-square angular error (MSAE) and covariance of vector angular error (CVAE) are introduced, and their lower bounds are derived. The advantage of using vector sensors is highlighted by explicit evaluation of the MSAE and CVAE bounds for source localization with a single vector sensor. A simple algorithm for estimating the source DOA with this sensor is presented along with its statistical performance analysis.	algorithm;angularjs;array processing;direction of arrival;mean squared error;polarization (waves);sensor;statistical model	Arye Nehorai;Eytan Paldi	1994	IEEE Trans.

We show that different ways of taking the continuous limit of the same model may result in either an ODE or a SDE and study the manner in which each approximates the discrete model. We compare the asymptotic properties of the continuous equations with those of the discrete dynamics and show that they tend to provide a better approximation when a greater amount of variance of the discrete model is preserved in the continuous limit.

In this paper we adopt a structured Markovian formalism, namely SAN (Stochastic Automata Networks), to model and analyze two popular mobility models for wireless networks: the Random Waypoint and Random Direction. Our modeling considers mobility over a discrete space, i.e., over a space divided in a given number of slots, allowing a suitable analytical representation of structured regions. We represent several important aspects of mobility models, such as varying speed and pause times, and several border behaviors that may take place. One, two, and three-dimensional models are presented. For the two-dimensional models, we show that any regular or irregular convex polygon can be modeled, and we describe several routing strategies in two dimensions. In all cases, the spatial node distribution obtained from the steady state analysis is presented and whenever analogous results over continuous spaces were available in the literature, the comparison with the ones obtained in this paper is shown to be coherent. Besides showing the suitability of SAN to model this kind of reality, the paper also contributes to new findings for the modeled mobility models over a noncontinuous space.	3d computer graphics;algorithmic efficiency;apache axis;automata theory;automaton;coherence (physics);computation;dependability;discretization;km3;modular programming;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;random-access memory;reachability;routing;semantics (computer science);simulation;state space;steady state;waypoint;workstation;xfig	Fernando Luís Dotti;Paulo Fernandes;Cristina M.

5bd1a6a6c2532f443e6b8939338ed130d1ab7051	asymptotic mutual information for the two-groups stochastic block model		We develop an information-theoretic view of the stochastic block model, a popular statistical model for the large-scale structure of complex networks. A graph G from such a model is generated by first assigning vertex labels at random from a finite alphabet, and then connecting vertices with edge probabilities depending on the labels of the endpoints. In the case of the symmetric two-group model, we establish an explicit ‘single-letter’ characterization of the pervertex mutual information between the vertex labels and the graph. The explicit expression of the mutual information is intimately related to estimation-theoretic quantities, and –in particular– reveals a phase transition at the critical point for community detection. Below the critical point the per-vertex mutual information is asymptotically the same as if edges were independent. Correspondingly, no algorithm can estimate the partition better than random guessing. Conversely, above the threshold, the per-vertex mutual information is strictly smaller than the independent-edges upper bound. In this regime there exists a procedure that estimates the vertex labels better than random guessing.	algorithm;complex network;critical point (network science);graph (discrete mathematics);information theory;mutual information;statistical model;stochastic block model	Yash Deshpande;Emmanuel Abbe;Andrea Montanari	2015	CoRR		variation of information;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;interaction information;statistics;pointwise mutual information	ML	40.90463883636031	16.403774045134487	188605

b5c01f63e6a9ef255c82df42b3704e2f42655ff4	stochastic localization + stieltjes barrier = tight bound for log-sobolev		Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities are a powerful way to estimate the rate of convergence of Markov chains and to derive concentration inequalities on distributions. We prove that the log-Sobolev constant of any isotropic logconcave density in <i>R</i><sup><i>n</i></sup> with support of diameter <i>D</i> is Ω(1/<i>D</i>), resolving a question posed by Frieze and Kannan in 1997. This is asymptotically the best possible estimate and improves on the previous bound of Ω(1/<i>D</i><sup>2</sup>) by Kannan-Lovász-Montenegro. It follows that for any isotropic logconcave density, the ball walk with step size δ=Θ(1/√<i>n</i>) mixes in <i>O</i><sup>*</sup>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup><i>D</i>) proper steps from any starting point. This improves on the previous best bound of <i>O</i><sup>*</sup>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup><i>D</i><sup>2</sup>) and is also asymptotically tight. The new bound leads to the following refined large deviation inequality for an <i>L</i>-Lipschitz function g over an isotropic logconcave density <i>p</i>: for any <i>t</i>>0, [complex formula not displayed]   where ḡ is the median or mean of <i>g</i> for <i>x</i>∼ <i>p</i>; this improves on previous bounds by Paouris and by Guedon-Milman. Our main proof is based on stochastic localization together with a Stieltjes-type barrier function.		Yin Tat Lee;Santosh S.

In this paper, we propose a new computationally efficient subspace-based method without eigendecomposition (SUMWE) for the coherent narrowband signals impinging on a uniform linear array (ULA) by exploiting the array geometry and its shift invariance property. The coherency of incident signals is decorrelated through subarray averaging, and the null space is obtained through a linear operation of a matrix formed from the cross-correlations between some sensor data, where the effect of additive noise is eliminated. Consequently, the DOAs can be estimated without performing eigendecomposition, and there is no need to evaluate all correlations of the array data. Furthermore, the SUMWE is also suitable for the case of partly coherent or incoherent signals, and it can be extended to the spatially correlated noise by choosing appropriate subarrays. The statistical analysis of the SUMWE is studied, and the asymptotic mean-squared-error (MSE) expression of the estimation error is derived. The performance of the SUMWE is demonstrated, and the theoretical analysis is substantiated through numerical examples. It is shown that the SUMWE is superior in resolving closely spaced coherent signals with a small number of snapshots and at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and offers good estimation performance for both uncorrelated and correlated incident signals.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithmic efficiency;array processing;coherence (physics);cross-correlation;direction of arrival;kernel (linear algebra);mean squared error;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;utility functions on indivisible goods	Jingmin Xin;Akira Sano	2004	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2004.823469	multipath propagation;econometrics;spatial correlation;eigendecomposition of a matrix;index term;cross-correlation;mathematics;mean squared error;linear map;estimation theory;signal-to-noise ratio;direction of arrival;shift-invariant system;statistics	EDA	53.319531666953566	9.086014179899482	189967

The authors derive a maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion through a combination of Bayesian inference and predictive densities. The MAP criterion is more appropriate for damped sinusoidal models (and transient data models in general) than are the SVD based information theoretic criteria in V. Umpathy Reddy and L.S. Biradar (1993). Simulation results are provided that display the breakdown of the AIC and MDL when the data record length is not properly coupled with the information bearing portion of the data model. This deterioration in performance is related to both the underlying asymptotics upon which the AIC and MDL rules were originally based, and to their invalid penalty terms. Conversely, the MAP criterion is not based on asymptotics, and proves to be more reliable and consistent when the observation length is varied.		William B. Bishop;Petar M.

The main limitation to the use of RS is the need to find an adequate upper bound for the ratio of the target probability density function (pdf) over the proposal pdf from which the samples are generated. There are no general methods to analytically find this bound, except in the particular case in which the target pdf is log-concave. In this paper we adopt a Bayesian view of the problem and propose a general RS scheme to draw from the posterior pdf of a signal of interest using its prior density as a proposal function.

For an arbitrary weighted digraph, we consider a matrix of specific weights of maximum out forests and demonstrate how this matrix can be used to get a graph-theoretic interpretation for the limiting probabilities of Markov chains. For a special (nonclassical) correspondence between Markov chains and weighted digraphs, the matrix of Cesáro limiting transition probabilities of any finite homogeneous Markov chain coincides with the normalized matrix of maximum out forests of the corresponding digraphs. This provides a finite (combinatorial) method to calculate the limiting probabilities of Markov chains and thus their stationary distributions. On the other hand, the Markov chain technique provides the proofs to some statements about digraphs.	directed graph;file spanning;graph theory;markov chain;spanning tree;stationary process;the matrix	Pavel Yu.

This paper considers the problem of determining the first-order probability density function of y(t) . The approach is to apply the \nu th-order Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov type equations. Based upon an assumption as to the linearity of a coefficient of the resulting differential equation, a closed-form solution is obtained for p(y) . The result agrees with the previous work of Doyle, McFadden and Marx who solved the special case when the bandwidth of the RC filter is twice the bandwidth of the input noise. The result also agrees, to within experimental error, with a Monte Carlo simulation over four orders of magnitude of variation of the ratio of the bandwidths of the RC filter and the input process.	nonlinear system;severo ornstein	Robert F.

So they try to predict a transient response from data which are sampled in a quasi-steady-state situation. For reentrant supply chains this prediction is based on insufficient information, since subsequent arrivals can dramatically change the TPT. This paper extends these standard models by introducing the concept of a stochastic phase velocity which dynamically updates the TPT estimate. This leads to the concepts of temperature and diffusion in the corresponding kinetic and fluid models for supply chains.	reentrancy (computing);steady state;stochastic process;throughput;velocity (software development)	Dieter Armbruster;Christian A.

There are two alternative design objectives: minimizing the trace of the error correlation matrix and thus minimizing the mean-squared error, or minimizing the determinant of the error correlation matrix and thus maximizing information rate. It is shown that a solution to both problems is to first transform the noisy observations into canonical coordinates, quantize and apply a Wiener filter in this coordinate system, and then transform the result back to the original coordinates. Canonical coordinates are uncorrelated, and quantization and Wiener filtering are applied to each component independently. The type of canonical coordinate system depends on the design objective: Quantization in half-canonical coordinates minimizes the mean-squared error and quantization in full-canonical coordinates maximizes information rate. Finally, it is also demonstrated in this paper that majorization is the fundamental principle underlying proofs of optimal transform coding.	information theory;linear algebra;mean squared error;minkowski addition;peak information rate;post canonical system;programmer;quantization (signal processing);transform coding;utility functions on indivisible goods;wiener filter	Peter J.

33689257a9b5c0896707e54e1e3560b2f12ea615	recovering communities in the general stochastic block model without knowing the parameters		The stochastic block model (SBM) has recently gathered significant attention due to new threshold phenomena. However, most developments rely on the knowledge of the model parameters, or at least on the number of communities. This paper introduces efficient algorithms that do not require such knowledge and yet achieve the optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs identified in Abbe-Sandon ’15. In the constant degree regime, an algorithm is developed that requires only a lower-bound on the relative sizes of the communities and achieves the optimal accuracy scaling for large degrees. This lower-bound requirement is removed for the regime of diverging degrees. For the logarithmic degree regime, this is further enhanced into a fully agnostic algorithm that simultaneously learns the model parameters, achieves the optimal CH-limit for exact recovery, and runs in quasilinear time. These provide the first algorithms affording efficiency, universality and information-theoretic optimality for strong and weak consistency in the SBM.	algorithm;divergence (computer science);image scaling;information theory;stochastic block model;super bit mapping;time complexity;universality probability;weak consistency	Emmanuel Abbe;Colin Sandon	2015			econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics	ML	47.48796314599037	9.341354611958403	192304

In this paper, we define weak, sectional and strong recovery for NNM to succeed at finding the low rank solution. We find tight conditions for these and analyze them for the case where the linear measurement operator consists of i.i.d. Gaussian entries. Finally we calculate the so called weak, sectional and strong thresholds for the success of nuclear norm minimization. To obtain our results, we generalize the notion of sign and support from sparse vectors to low rank matrices, and achieve a weak threshold which is much closer to the empirical phase transition curve of nuclear norm minimization than the existing bounds available in the literature.	sparse matrix	Samet Oymak;M.

For non-differentiability through stochastic processes of the Markov type, the non-differentiable entropy concept on a space-time manifold in the hydrodynamic version and its correspondence with motion variables (energy, momentum, etc.) are established. Moreover, for the same non-differentiability type, through a scale resolution dependence of a fundamental length and wave function independence with respect to the proper time, a non-differentiable Klein–Gordon-type equation in the wave function version is obtained. For a phase-amplitude functional dependence on the wave function, the non-differentiable spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism implies pattern generation in the form of Cooper non-differentiable-type pairs, while its non-differentiable topology implies some fractal logic elements (fractal bit, fractal gates, etc.).	complex system;fractal dimension;markov chain;scale relativity;spontaneous order;stochastic process;symmetry breaking	Maricel Agop;Alina Gavrilut;Gavril Stefan;Bogdan Doroftei	2015	Entropy	10.3390/e17042184	mathematical analysis;invariant manifold;topology;fractal derivative;fractal landscape;mathematics;geometry;quantum mechanics	Theory	46.49526772755812	16.2985272013485	192623

Typically, mobile sensors are mounted on vehicles. Each sensor continuously measures the distance from it to the target object. The proposed framework does not require any positioning function, anchor-location information, or additional mechanisms to obtain side information such as angle of arrival of signal. Under the assumption of a convex polygon target object, each edge length and vertex angle and their combinations are estimated and finally the shape of the target object is estimated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result in which a target-object shape was estimated by using the data of distance sensors without using their locations.	angle of arrival;numerical method;privacy;sensor;vertex (geometry)	Hiroshi Saito;Tatsuaki Kimura	2018	CoRR		computer vision;vertex angle;computer science;distributed computing;angle of arrival;artificial intelligence;convex polygon	Mobile	49.951641661458744	5.483787948041469	192682

This detector is shown to have interesting similarities to the locally optimum detector for random signals. It may also be viewed as a generalization of the locally optimum rank detector for known signals. Examples of the test statistic of the detector are given for some specific noise probability density functions.

In this class of tests, the decision-maker declares the true hypothesis almost always after collecting a fixed number of samples n; however in very rare cases with exponentially small probability the decision maker is allowed to collect another set of samples (no more than polynomial in n). This class of hypothesis tests are shown to bridge the gap between the classical hypothesis testing with a fixed sample size and the sequential hypothesis testing, and improve the trade-off between type-I and type-II error exponents.	polynomial	Anusha Lalitha;Tara Javidi	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541591	p-rep;uniformly most powerful test;econometrics;statistical hypothesis testing;discrete mathematics;p-value;test statistic;one- and two-tailed tests;closed testing procedure;orthogonal array testing;statistical power;mathematics;statistical significance;sequential probability ratio test;statistics	Theory	46.78376258409482	10.383749231242193	193206

It supports an abstract style of modelling, in which discrete levels of concentration within a species are considered instead of individual molecules. A finer granularity for the system corresponds to a smaller concentration step size and therefore to a greater number of concentration levels. This style of model is amenable to a variety of different analysis techniques, including numerical analysis based on a CMTC with states reflecting the levels of concentration. In this paper we present a formal definition of the CTMC with levels derived from a Bio-PEPA system. Furthermore we investigate the relationship between this CTMC and the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) derived from the same model. Using Kurtz’s theorem, we show that the set of ODEs derived from the Bio-PEPA model is able to capture the limiting behaviour of the CTMC obtained from the same system. Finally, we define an empirical methodology to find the granularity of the Bio-PEPA system for which the ODE and the CTMC with levels are in a good agreement. The proposed definition is based on a notion of distance between the two models. We demonstrate our approach on a model of the Repressilator, a simple biochemical network with oscillating behaviour.	automated theorem proving;british informatics olympiad;markov chain;numerical analysis;pepa;repressilator	Federica Ciocchetta;Andrea Degasperi;Jane Hillston;Muffy Calder	2009	Electr.

Regularity increases the entropy and the maximal entropy is shown to result when a regular n-gon is inscribed in a circle. A regular n-gon circumscribing a circle gives the largest entropy reduction, or the smallest change in entropy from the state of maximum entropy which occurs in the asymptotic infinite n limit. EOM are shown to correspond to minimum perimeter and maximum area in the theory of convex bodies, and can be used in the prediction of new inequalities for convex sets. These expressions are shown to be related to the phase functions obtained from the WKB approximation for Bessel and Hermite functions.	approximation;bessel filter;convex set;enterprise output management;gon;hermite polynomials;linear algebra;maximal set;perimeter	B.

It is desired to approximate the nonlinearity with a simpler function and two different criteria are considered for selecting this approximation, viz., the mean-square error obtained before and after the linear transformation. A sufficient condition is presented-for an approximation to simultaneously minimize both error criteria; in addition, it is shown that if the two minima coincide for every linear transformation and every nonlinearity, this condition is also necessary. The condition appears as a restriction on the class of approximating functions and is related to the second-order distributions of x(t) . For several processes of interest, this restriction is satisfied when the approximating functions are polynomials, the most notable example being the Gaussian process.	approximation	Robert Lugannani	1970	IEEE Trans.

In this procedure the number of extra function evaluations used to evaluate the condition estimate determines the order of the estimate. That is, the probability that the estimate is off by a given factor is inversely proportional to the factor raised to the order of the method. The “transpose-free” nature of this new method allows it to be applied to a broad range of problems in which the function maps between spaces of different dimensions. This is in sharp contrast to the more common power method condition estimation procedure that is limited, in the usual case where the Frechet derivative is known only implicitly, to maps between spaces of equal dimension.

Suboptimal fusion rules taking into account CFO and initial phase and non-data-aided methods of low complexity for CFO and initial phase shift estimation are developed. Instead of the estimation performance, the objective function is in terms of the final detection performance. In particular, a generalized likelihood ratio test is proposed first for distributed detection in the presence of unknown CFOs and phase shifts. Then computationally simplified algorithms are proposed under the high and low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, respectively. Specifically, under the high-SNR condition, a time-averaging autocorrelator is used for CFO estimation and the Chair-Varshney fusion rule is used for decision fusion; while under the low-SNR condition, maximum likelihood estimation can be realized by a fast Fourier transform. The simulation results show that the developed fusion schemes are robust to CFO and initial phase.	approximation algorithm;autocorrelator;carrier frequency offset;fast fourier transform;loss function;optimization problem;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Tao Wu;Qi Cheng	2008	2008 42nd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems	10.1109/CISS.2008.4558592	fast fourier transform;speech recognition;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;statistics	EDA	52.44402634408424	4.272867928959716	194737

A popular and useful example of this problem is matrix completion, in which the measurements reveal the values of a subset of the entries, and we wish to fill in the missing entries (this is the famous Netflix problem). When M is believed to have low rank, one would ideally try to recover M by finding the minimum-rank matrix that is consistent with the data; this is, however, problematic since this is a nonconvex problem that is, generally, intractable. Nuclear-norm minimization has been proposed as a tractable approach, and past papers have delved into the theoretical properties of nuclear-norm minimization algorithms, establishing conditions under which minimizing the nuclear norm yields the minimum rank solution. We review this spring of emerging literature and extend and refine previous theoretical results. Our focus is on providing error bounds when M is well approximated by a low-rank matrix, and when the measurements are corrupted with noise. We show that for a certain class of random linear measurements, nuclear-norm minimization provides stable recovery from a number of samples nearly at the theoretical lower limit, and enjoys order-optimal error bounds (with high probability).	approximation algorithm;cobham's thesis;minimax;signal-to-noise ratio;with high probability	Emmanuel J.

Arimoto inspired the relation between the Rényi entropy and the ℓ<inf>r</inf>-norm of probability distributions, and he introduced a conditional version of the Rényi entropy. From this perspective, we analyze the ℓ<inf>r</inf>-norms of particular distributions. As results, we identify specific probability distributions which achieve our sharp bounds on the conditional Rényi entropy. The sharp bounds derived in this study can be applicable to other information measures which are strictly monotone functions of the conditional Rényi entropy.	rényi entropy;monotone	Yuta Sakai;Ken-ichi Iwata	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2017.8007075	principle of maximum entropy;min entropy;discrete mathematics;mathematics;combinatorics;joint entropy;maximum entropy probability distribution;conditional entropy;rényi entropy;conditional quantum entropy;joint quantum entropy	Embedded	44.862969199184654	15.158885905996026	195329
3a0bc106028d22647699d8c64883270f30de7ab0	on the performance of music with toeplitz rectification in the context of large arrays		"""When using subspace methods for DoA estimation such as MUSIC, it is well known that a performance loss occurs when the number of available samples <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$N$</tex-math></inline-formula> is not large compared to the number of sensors <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$M$</tex-math></inline-formula>. This degradation is mainly due to the use of the sample correlation matrix (SCM), which is a poor estimator of the true correlation matrix of the observations in this situation. When the latter exhibits a Toeplitz structure, a standard trick consists in correcting the structure of the SCM by averaging its entries along the subdiagonals. This procedure, known as Toeplitz rectification, is widely known to improve the estimation of the true correlation matrix, hence the performance of the corresponding subspace methods. In this paper, we propose a statistical analysis of the MUSIC method using Toeplitz rectified SCM (refered to as R-MUSIC), in the context where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$M,N$</tex-math></inline-formula> are of the same order of magnitude.

This class is based on the maximum-entropy extension and/or completion of partially specified matrix-valued Hermitian covariance matrices in both the space and time dimensions. This first paper considers the more restricted class of Toeplitz Hermitian covariance matrices that model stationary clutter. If the clutter is stationary only in time then we deal with a Toeplitz-block matrix, whereas clutter that is stationary in time and space is described by a Toeplitz-block-Toeplitz matrix. We first derive exact expressions for this new class of 2-D models that act as approximations for the unknown true covariance matrix. Second, we propose suboptimal (but computationally simpler) relaxed 2-D time-varying autoregressive models (ldquorelaxationsrdquo) that directly use the non-Toeplitz Hermitian sample covariance matrix. The high efficiency of these parametric models is illustrated by simulation results using true ground-clutter covariance matrices provided by the DARPA KASSPER Dataset 1, which is a trusted phenomenological airborne radar model, and a complementary AFRL dataset.	airborne ranger;approximation;autoregressive model;clutter;lagrangian relaxation;principle of maximum entropy;radar;simulation;space-time adaptive processing;stationary process;toeplitz hash algorithm	Yuri I.

We derive a new detector consisting of a properly weighted sum of the received signal spectral components. Through the study of a properly defined loss function, we show that the receiver is suitable for all-sky search (signal direction of arrival unknown) with a moderate computational demand. The performances of the detector are analytically derived. The exhibited capability of performing the all-sky search trades off favorably for a slight performance degradation with respect to the optimum non-coherent detector. ( 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

With some kinds of waveforms, the range and range rate measurement errors are correlated. It is pointed in [1] that the negative correlation can improve the steady state tracking performance greatly and the tracking performance under positive correlation will be worse than that under no correlation. With further simulation in this paper, it can be seen that the tracking performance under positive correlation is not always worse than that under no correlation. Under the assumption that the range and range rate accuracy are not affected by the correlation, the relationship between the tracking performance and the correlation is revealed through one-step analytical analysis. For better tracking performance, the absolute value of the measurement correlation coefficient should be as big as possible and its sign should use the opposite sign of the one step prediction covariance correlation.	coefficient;doppler effect;profiling (computer programming);sonar (symantec);simulation;steady state;tracking system	Xianghui Yuan;Chongzhao Han;Zhansheng Duan	2009	2009 12th International Conference on Information Fusion		computer vision;scaled correlation;control theory;statistics	Robotics	52.77624593108755	6.103368376951035	197557

Because of the nonuniform transmitted pulses, special techniques are required for spectrum analysis of the received signal in these radars. An algorithm for spectrum analysis of multiple PRF radars is presented here. The algorithm is based on the compressive sensing (CS) theory and uses the sparse characteristic of received signal in frequency domain and universal sampling pattern of multiple PRF pulses for determining the Doppler frequencies of targets. Moreover, a CS-based algorithm for blind estimation of the number of targets is presented. The proposed algorithms work properly in low sampling rates and in the presence of multiple targets and Gaussian clutter. Simulation results are presented for illustrating high performance of the algorithms.	algorithm;clutter;compressed sensing;primitive recursive function;radar;sampling (signal processing);simulation;sparse matrix	Farnoosh Talaei;Mahmood Modarres-Hashemi;Saeid Sadri	2014	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2014.120530	continuous-wave radar;electronic engineering;radar engineering details;telecommunications;pulse repetition frequency;pulse-doppler radar;remote sensing	Visualization	52.32511667884966	8.673594070234634	198058

These measures can be used for quantitative comparison of languages, and the entropy can be viewed as the information contents of a timed language. For languages accepted by deterministic timed automata, we give exact formulas for volumes. Next, for a large class of timed languages accepted by non-Zeno timed automata, we devise a method to approximate the volumes and the entropy based on discretization.

With known integer regressors, the problem is classical linear regression. In many applications, however, the actual regressors are unknown; only categorical information (i.e., the regressors are integers) and, perhaps, loose bounds are available. Examples include hop timing estimation, pulse repetition interval (PRI) analysis, and passive rotating-beam radio scanning. With unknown regressors, this seemingly simple problem exhibits many surprising twists. Even for small sample sizes, a proposed quasi-maximum likelihood approach essentially meets the clairvoyant CRB at moderately high SNR - the latter assumes knowledge of the unknown regressors. This is quite unusual, and it holds despite the fact that our algorithm ignores noise color. We outline analogies and differences between our problem and classical linear regression and harmonic retrieval, and corroborate our findings with careful simulations.		Nikos D.

It is demonstrated that the entropy rate plays a key role in the performance and robustness of chaotic-map TRNGs, which must be taken into account in the circuit design optimization. Finally, the optimality conditions for postprocessing units that extract truly random bits from a raw random number generator are derived.	approximate entropy;approximation algorithm;chaos theory;circuit design;entropy rate;hidden markov model;markov chain;mathematical optimization;random number generation;random number generator attack	Ahmad Beirami;Hamid Nejati	2013	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2013.2258274	network synthesis filters;computer vision;markov chain;maximum-entropy markov model;combinatorics;random number generation;computer science;machine learning;hidden semi-markov model;mathematics;markov model;pseudorandom number generator;hidden markov model;statistics;variable-order markov model	Theory	47.47393511836976	16.081791010519435	199369

Different from the conventional STAP filters, the proposed STAP filters are derived by three steps. Firstly, a virtual space-time snapshot is constructed using the property of the coprime sampling. Secondly, an equivalent covariance matrix with enhanced degrees of freedom is computed by using spatial-temporal smoothing approach. Thirdly, two optimal STAP filters are derived based on the estimated covariance matrix. Simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed filters.	airborne ranger;clutter;computer simulation;sampling (signal processing);smoothing;snapshot (computer storage);space-time adaptive processing;virtual reality;zero suppression	Xiaoye Wang;Zhaocheng Yang;Jianjun Huang	2017	2017 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)	10.1109/ISPACS.2017.8266508	computer science;control theory;coprime integers;covariance matrix;radar;pulse repetition frequency;smoothing;space-time adaptive processing;clutter;signal-to-noise ratio	Arch	53.574776570392636	7.670354465274041	199411

Our results suggest that percolation for small r below r(max)≈8 (lattice units) is a second-order transition, and for larger r is a first-order transition. For r<r(max), the critical threshold increases linearly with r from 0.593 at r=0 and reaches a maximum, 0.738 for r=r(max), and then gradually decreases to 0.683 for r=∞. Our analytical considerations are in good agreement with simulations. Our study suggests that interdependent infrastructures embedded in Euclidean space become most vulnerable when the distance between interdependent nodes is in the intermediate range, which is much smaller than the size of the system.	anatomic node;cartesian closed category;cascading failure;embedded system;embedding;first-order predicate;interdependence;large;lattice network;node - plant part;percolation;randomness;simulation;small;emotional dependency	Wei Li;Amir Bashan;Sergey V.
