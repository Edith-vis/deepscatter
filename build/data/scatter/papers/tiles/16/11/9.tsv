This paper incorporates this theory into the already developed framework of persistent homology. We demonstrate that persistent intersection homology gives useful information about the relationship between an embedded stratified space and its singularities. We give, and prove the correctness of, an algorithm for the computation of the persistent intersection homology groups of a filtered simplicial complex equipped with a stratification by subcomplexes. We also derive, from Poincar é Duality, some structural results about persistent intersection homology.

770a4d136d77b96ec4189477929eea92a6f74382	graphical nonconvex optimization via an adaptive convex relaxation		This supplementary material collects proofs for the main theoretical results in the main text and additional technical lemmas. The proofs of Proposition 3.4, Theorems 3.5 and 3.6 are collected in Section A. Section B provides the proof for Theorem 3.8. Proofs related to semiparametric graphical models are given in Section C. Various concentration inequalities and preliminary lemmas are postponed to Sections D and E, respectively. A. Rate of Convergence in Frobenius Norm This section presents an upper bound for the adaptive estimator Ψ̂ in Frobenius norm, which in turn establishes the scaling conditions needed to achieve the optimal spectral norm convergence rate. A.1. Proofs of Proposition 3.4, Theorems 3.5 and 3.6 In this section, we collect the proofs for Proposition 3.4, Theorems 3.5 and 3.6. In order to suppress the noise at the `th step, it is necessary to control min(i,j)∈S ∣∣Ψ̂(`−1) ij ∣∣ in high dimensions. For this, we construct an entropy set, E`, of S and analyze the magnitude of ∥∥λ(`−1) Ec ` ∥∥min. The entropy set at the `-th stage, E`, is defined as E` = { (i, j) : (i, j) ∈ S or λ ij < λw(u), for u = 2 ( 32‖Ψ‖2 + ‖Σ‖∞ ∨ 1 ) λ } . (A.1) Thus the constant in Assumption 3.3 is c = 2(32‖Ψ‖2 + ‖Σ‖∞ ∨ 1). Then it can be seen that S ⊆ E`, and thus E` is an entropy set of S for any ` ≥ 1. Proposition 3.4 follows from a slightly more general result below, which establishes rate of convergence for the one-step estimator of sparse inverse correlation matrix Ψ̂. Proposition A.1 (One-step Estimator). Assume that assumption 3.1 holds. Suppose 8‖Ψ‖2λ √ s < 1. Take λ such that λ √ (log d)/n and suppose n & log d. Then with probability at least 1− 8/d, Ψ̂ must satisfy ∥∥Ψ̂(1) −Ψ∗∥∥F ≤ C‖Ψ‖2 √ s log d n . Proof of Proposition A.1. Define the event J = { ‖Ĉ −C‖max ≤ λ/2 } . Then in the event J , by applying Lemma A.4 and taking E = S, we obtain ‖Ψ̂ −Ψ‖F ≤ 4‖Ψ‖2 · λ √ s. If we further take λ = √ 3c−1 2 √ (log d)/n √ (log d)/n, then by Lemma D.5, we have event J hold with probability at least 1 − 8d−1. The result follows by plugging the choice of λ. Theorems 3.5 and 3.6 follow from a slightly more general result below, which characterizes the rate of convergence of Ψ̂ in Frobenius norm and that of Θ̃ ) in spectral norm. 1 Theorem A.2. Suppose that 8‖Ψ‖2λ √ s < 1. Take λ such that λ √ log d/n. Under Assumptions 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, with probability at least 1− 8d−1, Ψ̂ satisfies ∥∥Ψ̂(`)−Ψ∗∥∥F ≤ 8‖Ψ‖2‖∇L(Ψ)S‖F } {{ } Optimal Rate + 1 2 ∥∥Ψ̂(`−1)−Ψ∗∥∥F } {{ } Contraction , 1 ≤ ` ≤ T. Moreover, if that T & log(λ √ n), we have ∥∥Ψ̂(T )−Ψ∗∥∥F = OP(‖Ψ∗‖22√s/n), and ∥∥Θ̃(T ) −Θ∗∥∥ 2 = OP ( σ max‖Ψ‖2 σ3 min √ log d n ∨ ‖Ψ‖2 σ2 min √ s n ) . Proof of Theorem A.2. Under the conditions of the theorem, combining Proposition A.7 and Lemma D.5, we obtain the following contraction property of the solutions, {Ψ̂}`=1, ∥∥Ψ̂(`)−Ψ∗∥∥F≤4‖Ψ∗‖22‖∇L(Ψ∗)S‖F + 12∥∥Ψ̂(`−1)−Ψ∗∥∥F. Next, we introduce an inequality by induction analysis. Specifically, if an ≤ a0 + αan−1, ∀ n ≥ 2 and 0 ≤ α < 1, then an ≤ a0 1− αn−1 1− α + αa1. Taking a0 = 4‖Ψ‖2‖∇L(Ψ)S‖F, we obtain that ∥∥Ψ̂(`)−Ψ∗∥∥F ≤ 8‖Ψ‖2‖∇L(Ψ)S‖F + (1/2)`−1∥∥Ψ̂(1)−Ψ∗∥∥F. In the sequel, we bound ‖∇L(Ψ)S‖F and ‖Ψ̂ −Ψ‖F, respectively. By Proposition A.1, we have ‖Ψ̂ −Ψ‖F . 8‖Ψ‖2λ √ s. Moreover, if we let T ≥ log(λ √ n) / log 2 & log(λ √ n), then (1/2)T−1‖Ψ̂(1) −Ψ‖F ≤ 16‖Ψ‖2 · √ s/n. On the other side, we have ‖∇L(Ψ)S‖F = OP(‖Ψ‖2 · √ s/n), which follows from Lemma D.4. Therefore, combining the above results, we have ‖Ψ̂ ) −Ψ‖F = OP ( ‖Ψ‖2 √ s/n ) . To achieve the statistical rate for ‖Θ̃ ) −Θ‖2, we apply Lemma E.3 and obtain that ‖Θ̃ ) −Θ‖2 = ∥∥(Ŵ−1−W−1)(Ψ̂(T )−Ψ∗)(Ŵ−1−W−1)∥∥ 2 + ∥∥(Ŵ−1−W−1)Ψ̂(T )W−1∥∥ 2 + ∥∥(Ŵ−1−W−1)Ψ∗Ŵ−1∥∥ 2 + ∥∥Ŵ−1(Ψ̂(T ) −Ψ∗)W−1∥∥ 2 ≤ ‖Ŵ−1 −W‖2‖Ψ̂ ) −Ψ‖2 } {{ } (R1) +‖Ŵ−W‖2‖Ψ̂ ‖2‖W‖2 } {{ } (R2) +‖Ŵ−W‖2‖Ψ‖2‖Ŵ‖2 } {{ } (R3) +‖Ŵ‖2‖W‖2‖Ψ̂ ) −Ψ‖2 } {{ } (R4) . We now bound terms (R1) to (R4) respectively. Before we proceed, we apply Lemma D.2 and the union sum bound to obtain that, for any ε ≥ 0, P ( ‖Ŵ −W‖2 > εmax i Σii ) ≤ d · exp { −n · C(ε) } = exp { −n · C(ε)+log d } , where C(ε) = 2−1(ε − log(1 + ε)). Suppose that 0 ≤ ε ≤ 1/2, then we have −n · C(ε) ≤ −n · ε/3. Further suppose that n ≥ 36 log d and take ε = 3 √ (log d)/n, we obtain that−n · C(ε)+log d ≤ 2 log d and P ( ‖Ŵ −W‖2 > 3σ max · √ log d n ) ≤ 1 d2 , where we use the assumption that maxi Σii ≤ σ max. Therefore, we have ∥∥Ŵ2−W2∥∥ 2 = OP ( σ max · √ log d/n ) . Since Ŵ and W are diagonal and thus commutative. We note that, for any two eventA and B, P(A) = P(A∩B)+P(A∩B) holds. Therefore, for any M > 0, we have P (∥∥Ŵ−1 −W−1∥∥ 2 > Mσ max √ log d n ) ≤ P (∥∥Ŵ−1−W−1∥∥ 2 >Mσ max √ log d n , ∥∥Ŵ−1−W−1∥∥ 2 ≤2( √ 2+1) ∥∥W∥∥ 2 λ−2 min ( W )∥∥Ŵ2−W2∥∥ 2 ) + P (∥∥Ŵ−1−W−1∥∥ 2 >2( √ 2+1) ∥∥W∥∥ 2 λ−2 min ( W )∥∥Ŵ2−W2∥∥ 2 ) . Further using Lemma E.7 yields that P (∥∥Ŵ−1−W−1∥∥ 2 > Mσ max √ log d n ) ≤ P ( 2( √ 2+1) ∥∥W∥∥ 2 λ−2 min ( W )∥∥Ŵ2−W2∥∥ 2 >Mσ max √ log d n ) } {{ } (T1) + P (∥∥Ŵ2 −W2∥∥ 2 > 2λmin ( W )) } {{ } (T2) . By taking M = M1 · ‖W‖2λ min(W) = M1 · σmax/σ min and letting M1 → 0, we get (T1)→ 0. Under the assumption that σ max/σ 2 min = O ( (n/ log d) ) , we have σ max/σ 2 min = o (√ n/ log d ) , and thus (T2)→ 0. Therefore we obtain that ∥∥Ŵ−1 −W−1∥∥ 2 = OP ( σ−4 minσ 3 max √ (log d)/n ) . Similarly, we have the following facts: ∥∥Ψ̂(T )∥∥ 2 = OP ( ‖Ψ‖2 ) , ∥∥Ŵ−1∥∥ 2 = λ−1 min ( Ŵ ) = OP(σ min), and ∥∥W−1∥∥ 2 = σ−1 min. Applying the above results to the terms (R1)-(R4). we obtain that (R1) = OP ( σ−2 min‖Ψ ‖2 √ s n · σ 6 max σ6 min log d n ) = OP ( σ−2 min‖Ψ ‖2 √ s n ) , (R2) = (R3) = OP ( σ max σ3 min ‖Ψ‖2 √ log d n ) , (R4) = OP ( σ−2 min‖Ψ ‖2 √ s n ) . Therefore, by combining the rate for terms (R1)-(R4), we obtain the final result. A.2. Technical Lemmas Define the symmetrized Bregman divergence for the loss function L(·) asD L(Θ,Θ) = 〈 ∇L(Θ)−L(Θ∗),Θ−Θ∗ 〉 . For any matrix A ∈ Rd×d, let A− ∈ Rd×d be the off diagonal matrix of A with diagonal entries equal to 0, and A+ = A−A− be the diagonal mtrix. Lemma A.3. For the symmetrized Bregman divergence defined above, we have D L(Θ,Θ ∗) = 〈 ∇L(Θ)−∇L(Θ∗),Θ−Θ∗ 〉 ≥ ( ‖Θ‖2 + ‖Θ−Θ‖2 )−2‖Θ−Θ∗‖2F. Proof of Lemma A.3. We use vec(A) to denote the vectorized form of any matrix A. Then by the mean value theorem, there exists a γ ∈ [0, 1] such that, D L(Θ,Θ ∗) = 〈 ∇L(Θ)−∇L(Θ∗),Θ−Θ∗ 〉 = vec(Θ−Θ∗)T ( ∇2L(Θ∗ + γ∆) ) vec(Θ−Θ∗) ≥ λmin(∇L(Θ + γ∆) ) ‖∆‖F, where ∆ = Θ − Θ∗. By standard properties of the Kronecker product and the Weyl’s inequality (Horn and Johnson, 2012), we obtain that λmin ( ∇2L(Θ∗ + γ∆) ) = λmin (( (Θ∗ + γ∆)⊗ (Θ∗ + γ∆) )−1) = ‖Θ∗ + γ∆‖−2 2 ≥ ( ‖Θ‖2 + γ‖∆‖2 )−2 . Finally, observing that γ ≤ 1, we obtain D L(Θ,Θ ∗) = 〈 ∇L(Θ)−∇L(Θ∗),∆ 〉 ≥ ( ‖Θ‖2 + ‖∆‖2 )−2‖Θ−Θ∗‖2F. Plugging the definition of ∆ obtains us the final bound. The following lemma characterizes an upper bound of ‖Ψ̂−Ψ‖F by using localized analysis. Lemma A.4. Suppose 8‖Ψ‖2λ √ s < 1. Take E such that S ⊆ E and |E| ≤ 2s. Further assume ‖λEc‖min ≥ λ/2 ≥ ‖∇L(Ψ)‖max. Let Ψ̂ be the solution to (B.4). Then Ψ̂ must satisfy ‖Ψ̂−Ψ‖F ≤ 4‖Ψ‖2 ( ‖λS‖F+‖∇L(Ψ)E‖F ) ≤ 8‖Ψ‖2λ √ s. Proof of Lemma A.4. We start by introducing an extra local parameter r which satisfies 8‖Ψ‖2λ √ s < r ≤ ‖Ψ‖2. This is possible since λ √ |E| ≤ √ 2λ √ s → 0 and 8‖Ψ‖2λ √ s < 1 by assumption. Based on this local parameter r, we construct an intermediate estimator: Ψ̃ = Ψ∗ + t · (Ψ̂ − Ψ∗), where t is taken such that ‖(Ψ̃ − Ψ‖F = r, if ‖(Ψ̃−Ψ‖F > r; t = 1 otherwise. Applying Lemma A.3 with Θ1 = Ψ̃ and Θ2 = Ψ∗ obtains us (∥∥Ψ∗∥∥ 2 + r )−2∥∥Ψ̃−Ψ∗∥∥2F ≤ 〈∇L(Ψ̃)−∇L(Ψ∗), Ψ̃−Ψ∗〉. (A.2) To bound the right hand side of the above inequality, we use Lemma E.2 to obtain D L(Ψ̃,Ψ ∗) ≤ tD L(Ψ̂,Ψ) = t 〈 ∇L(Ψ̂)−∇L(Ψ∗), Ψ̂−Ψ∗ 〉 . (A.3) We note that the sub-differential of the norm ‖ · ‖1,off evaluated at Ψ consists the set of all symmetric matrices Γ ∈ Rd×d such that Γij = 0 if i = j; Γij = sign(Γij) if i 6= j and Ψij 6= 0; Γij ∈ [−1,+1] if i 6= j and Ψij = 0, where Ψij is the (i, j)-th entry of Ψ. Then by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, there exists a Γ̂ ∈ ∂‖Ψ̂‖1,off such that ∇L(Ψ̂)+λ Γ̂= Ĉ−Ψ̂−1+λ Γ̂ = 0. Plugging (A.3) into (A.2) and adding the term 〈λ Γ̂, Ψ̂−Ψ∗〉 on both sides of (A.3), we obtain (‖Ψ‖2+r)‖Ψ̃−Ψ‖F +t 〈∇L(Ψ∗), Ψ̂−Ψ∗〉 } {{ } I +t 〈λ Γ̂, Ψ̂−Ψ∗〉 } {{ } II ≤ t 〈∇L(Ψ̂)+λ Γ̂, Ψ̂−Ψ∗〉 } {{ } III . (A.4) Next, we bound terms I, II and III respectively. For a set E , let E denote its complement with respect to (w.r.t.) the full index set {(i, j) : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ d}. For term I, separating the support of∇L(Ψ) and Ψ̂−Ψ∗ to E ∪D and E \ D, in which D is the set consisting of all diagonal elements, and then using the matrix Hölder inequality, we obtain 〈 ∇L(Ψ∗), Ψ̂−Ψ∗ 〉 = 〈( ∇L(Ψ∗) ) E∪D, ( Ψ̂−Ψ∗ ) E∪D 〉 + 〈( ∇L(Ψ∗) ) Ec\D, ( Ψ̂−Ψ∗ ) Ec\D 〉 ≥− ∥∥(∇L(Ψ∗))E∪D∥∥F∥∥(Ψ̂−Ψ∗)E∪D∥∥F − ∥∥(∇L(Ψ∗))Ec\D∥∥F∥∥(Ψ̂−Ψ∗)Ec\D∥∥F. For term II, separating the support of (λ Γ̂) and (Ψ̂−Ψ∗) to S ∪ D and S \ D, we obtain 〈(λ Γ̂), (Ψ̂−Ψ∗)〉 = 〈(λ Γ̂)S∪D, (Ψ̂−Ψ)S∪D〉+〈(λ Γ̂)Sc\D, (Ψ̂−Ψ)Sc\D〉. (A.5) For the last term in the above equality, we have 〈(λ Γ̂)Sc\D, (Ψ̂−Ψ)Sc\D〉 = 〈λSc\D, |Ψ̂Sc\D|〉 = 〈λSc\D, |(Ψ̂−Ψ)Sc\D|〉. (A.6) Plugging (A.6) into (A.5) and applying matrix Hölder inequality yields 〈(λ Γ̂, Ψ̂−Ψ∗〉 = 〈(λ Γ̂)S∪D, (Ψ̂−Ψ)S∪D〉+ 〈λSc\D, |(Ψ̂−Ψ)Sc\D|〉 = 〈(λ Γ̂)S , (Ψ̂−Ψ)S〉+ ‖λSc\D‖F‖(Ψ̂−Ψ)Sc\D‖F ≥ −‖λS‖F‖(Ψ̂−Ψ)S‖F + ‖λEc\D‖F‖(Ψ̂−Ψ)Ec\D‖F, where we use λD = 0 in the second equality and E\D ⊆ S\D in the last inequality. For term III, using the optimality condition, we have III= 〈 ∇L(Ψ̂)+λ Γ̂, Ψ̂−Ψ 〉 =0. Plugging the bounds for term I, II and III back into (A.4), we find that ( ‖Ψ‖2 + r )−2∥∥Ψ̃−Ψ∗∥∥2F+t(‖λEc\D‖F − ‖(∇L(Ψ∗))Ec\D‖F) · ∥∥(Ψ̂−Ψ∗)Ec\D∥∥F ≤ t (∥∥(∇L(Ψ∗))E∪D∥∥F + ∥∥λS∥∥F) · ∥∥Ψ̂−Ψ∗∥∥F. Further observing the facts that ‖λEc\D‖F ≥ √ |Ec\D| ∥∥λEc\D∥∥min≥√|Ec\D|∥∥∇L(Ψ∗)∥∥max≥∥∥(∇L(Ψ∗))Ec\D∥∥F and t‖Ψ̂−Ψ‖F = ‖Ψ̃−Ψ‖F, dividing both sides by ‖Ψ̃−Ψ‖F, we can simplify the above inequality to (‖Ψ‖2+r)‖Ψ̃−Ψ‖F≤‖λS‖F+‖∇L(Ψ)E∪D‖F =‖λS‖F+‖∇L(Ψ)E‖F≤2λ √ s, where we use ‖∇L(Ψ)E∪D‖F = ‖(Ĉ − C)E∪D‖F = ‖(Ĉ − C)E‖F = ‖∇L	bregman divergence;exptime;emoticon;graphical model;image scaling;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;like button;log-space reduction;loss function;mathematical induction;matrix multiplication;maxima and minima;rate of convergence;relaxation (approximation);semiparametric model;singular value decomposition;social inequality;sparse matrix;the matrix;tucker decomposition	Qingnan Sun;Kean Ming Tan;Han Liu;Tong Zhang	2018			machine learning;artificial intelligence;regular polygon;computer science	ML	48.60343790351971	18.35107175758663	50384

We use the construction of Salvetti (1994) to calculate the cohomology of the Artin group associated to the complete graph Kn, using coefficients in a local system over Z[q, qt]. The standard cohomology over ~' is obtained by specializing q to 1. While doing such computations, we obtain also an explicit rational function for the Poincar6 series of the Coxeter group associated to K,, and note that it has exponential growth for n/> 4. 0. Let (W, S) be a Coxeter system [2]. It is known that there are realizations of Was a group of reflections in R"""", such that a fundamental domain D for Wis a polyhedral cone and the orbit of D is a cone U ~ R"""" (for example, D is a simplicial cone and U is the Tits-cone [2, 10]). Let ~¢ be the arrangement of reflection hyperplanes of Win R ' ; then W acts freely on the space r = (u + iR"""")\ U u~ HE.~' (Hc being the complexification of H). The fundamental group Gwofthe orbit space Yw:= Y/W is called the Artin group of type IV; a presentation of Gw is well-known [3, 4, 6, 14]. One of the authors showed [11] that the space gw contracts guru a cellular complex Xw which can be described quite naturally through identifications on the faces of a convex polyhedrum (namely, a realization of the Coxeter complex of W). This construction was used to compute the cohomology of rank 1 local systems over the orbit space with coefficients in Z[q, q ~ ] [11, Theorem 1.10]. Setting q = 1 the integer cohomology of all irreducible finite exceptional Coxeter groups was obtained. * Corresponding author. 0012-365X/97/$17.00 © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Stumbo / Discrete Mathematics 163 (1997) 129-138 It is well-known as Coxeter systems bijectively correspond to edge-weighted graphs, the weight of an edge if, j ) being a positive integer n(i,j) t> 3. Isomorphic graphs clearly give rise to isomorphic Coxeter systems: then we note that the orbit spaces above (so the complexes Xw) can be considered as """"topological"""" invariants of edgeweighted graphs. In particular their cohomology is an invariant. In this paper we go on with computations, trying to show how the construction in I1 l] allows calculations of the cohomology of Artin groups even for some infinite Coxeter groups. In the first part we recall the results in El 1], giving the slight changes necessary to treat the case of infinite Coxeter groups. In this case one has to consider just those subsets of S which generate a finite subgroup of W. In the second part we consider a (very natural) class of Artin groups associated to infinite Coxeter groups, namely the Artin groups associated to the complete graph K,. We calculate the cohomology of Gw(r,) with coefficients in a local system as above: this reduces to the standard cohomology over Z by specializing q to 1. In spite of the fact that for Artin groups associated to finite Coxeter groups the integer cohomology is known [1, 7, 13, 5, 12, 8, 11] this is to our knowledge the first computation of the cohomology for an Artin group associated to an infinite Coxeter group. The further ingredient (besides the constructions in [ 11]) which allows to conclude that the cohomology of Xwis also the cohomology of the Artin group ¢;wis taken from [9]: in fact, in case of the complete graph the combinatorial hypothesis of the main theorem of [9] is satisfied, so Xw is a k(lr, 1) space. In order to compute coboundaries one has (see Theorem B below) to know the Poincar~ series of the finite parabolic subgroups of IV. Actually we obtain the Poincar~ series for the whole W(K,): this is done through some standard combinatorial algebra. The result is an explicit rational function of degree zero which vanishes in the 2nd and 3rd-primitive roots of I and, for n 1> 4, has exponential growth. This fact seems interesting for itself: in fact, even if there is a well-known recursive formula for the Poincar6 series of Coxeter groups [ 2, 10] it seems that explicit closed formulas are not known in general. It turns out that one still obtains an algebraic complex even considering all subsets ol a ~',en those generating infinite subgroups of W.) Here one has to take coefficients in some ring extension, and the associated cohomology is essentially equivalent to that defined through subsets generating finite subgroups of W. However it is still interesting to compute this """"extended"""" algebraic complex, since (as remarked before) the involved functions are invariants of the associated edge-weighted graph (the Coxeter graph of (W, S)). So we make odr computations of coboundaries in this more general situation. !. Here we recall the construction given in Ell], using a slightly different (but equivalent) language. For l ' ~ S let Wr be the parabolic subgroup of W generated by F. M. Salvetti, F. Stumbo / Discrete Mathematics 163 (1997) 129-138 131 Thoor~m A. The orbit space Ywde[ined in the introduction contracts onto the followino cellular complex Xw: Let C(W) ~. {w.Wr: F cS, F finite} be the Coxeter complex of W (see for example I'10""""l). Identify each cell w.Wr of C(W) with the cell 1.Wr of the same type by using the homcomorphism induced by the unique element ,/e w.Wr of minimal length. Here the length of an element of W is measured with respect to the system of generators S. The homeomorphism is obtained by realizing the Coxeter complex as a W-invariant cellular complex in U, namely the dual to the stratification induc~ on U by the arrangement. Recall [11:] that this realization can be easily obtained as the convex hull of the W-orbit of one point lying in a fixed chamber. The natural cellular decomposition of the so obtained convex polyhedrum is just the dual to the stratification. Note that Xw has exactly one O-cell, and the l-cells correspond to oriente~l |oops around the complexification of the hyperplanes of a base chamber. ( Recall also [ 11 ] that for finite irreducible groups, Xw has exactly (~) i-cells). By the use of this construction, one can compute rank 1 local systems on Xw as follows. For each H c W the Poincar6 series of H is defined by H(q) = ~, q,(h) hcH where i is the length function measured with respect to S. Theorem B. Let R be a commutative ring with 1, q a unit of R. Let .Zq be the Ioccl system on Xw which corresponds to the representation Gw = ~l (Xw )--~ Aut(R) which takes a geometric generator (i.e., an oriented l-cell) of Xw into the multiplication by q. Then H*(Xw, ~'q) = H*(C~ *) where (~*, ~*(q)) is the algebraic complex given by ~ ' = { ~ vrF: F c S ~{1 . . . . . n},lF, = k, vr~ R, l#r is finite t and 6~(q)(F) = E (_ l)~O,r)+ t His ,.j(-q).rw """""""" wt-~j finite Here ¢~(A F) = # {i ¢ r: i <j}. (1) Proof. The only difference with Theorem 1.10 of [ l 1] is the finiteness condition on the subgroups generated by subsets of S, which comes since in the general case a k-cell in Xw corresponds to a subset F c S, such that Wr is finite (see also [15:]). [] 132 M. Salvetti, F. Stumbo / Discrete Mathematics 163 (1997) 129-138 2. In this section we compute the Poincar6 series for the Coxeter group associated to the complete graph. Let us denote with K, the complete graph with n vertices and with HI, the Coxeter group associated to such a graph. A presentation of W, is then [4, 6, 14] = <Sl . . . . . SnlS~ = 1, (SiSj) 3 = 1). For i = 1, 2, W~ corresponds to the Dynkin graph At, while W3 corresponds to/$3. Moreover, it is obvious that if { 1 . . . . . n} is the set of vertices of K. and F = {it . . . . . i . } is a subset, then the subgraph spanned by F is nothing else than Kin, to which the subgroup W,. = <st,, . . . . st.ls~ = 1, (stksj,) 3 = 1 > is associated. We recall some standard results [13]. If F c S and lr is the length in the parabolic subgroup IVr then lr = llwr. Moreover, in the field of formal power series in q, wc have -tr, IV(q) ~0 if IIV[ =oo , (2) ~-'~..., ( I j W---~ = tqN if I I V I < ~ , F c S where N is the maximum of the lengths in W. The Poincar6 series W(q) is a rational function (a polynomial, in the finite case) in q recursively computable [10]. First of all, we remark that we get easily the first cases: l/Wo(q) = l, 1/W~(q) = 1/(1 + q), 1/W2(q) = 1/(1 -4q)(l + q + q2)."""	artin billiard;coefficient;computable function;computation;cone (formal languages);convex cone;convex hull;discrete mathematics;fundamental domain;graph (discrete mathematics);invariant (computer science);irreducibility;lr parser;linear algebra;microsoft kin;parabolic antenna;polyhedron;polynomial;recursion;reflection (computer graphics);time complexity	Mario Salvetti;Fabio Stumbo	1997	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/0012-365X(95)00315-N	rational function;exponential growth;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;artin group;topology;longest element of a coxeter group;coxeter complex;coxeter group;mathematics;group cohomology;point group;complete graph;coxeter element;local system;coxeter graph;algebra	Theory	40.05732418507224	30.923820573674696	50615

6b5c2194485c93993bd8e03a9bdbc27e456df7b9	positive semantics of projections in venn-euler diagrams	diagrammatic notations;visual formalism;visual representation	Venn diagrams and Euler circles have long been used as a means of expressing relationships among sets using visual metaphors such as “disjointness” an d “containment” of topological contours. Although the notation is effective in delivering a clear visual modeling of set theoretical relationships, it does not scale well. The topolog y f Venn diagrams of four or more contours is so cluttered that it becomes impractical to use i t to visualize set relationships. In this work we study “projection contours”, a new means for p resenting sets intersections, which is designed to reduce the clutter in such diagrams. Inf ormally, a projected contour is a contour that describes a set of elements limited to a certain context. The challenge in introducing this notation is in producing precise and consistent semant ics for the general case, including a diagram comprising several, possibly interacting, projec tions, which might even be of the same base set. The semantics investigated here assigns a “positi ve” meaning to a projection, i.e., the semantics is based on the list of contours with which it inter acts, where contours disjoint to it do not change its semantics. Another approach, calling in lite rature a negative semantics, assigns to a projection the semantics based on the contours interact ing with the projection as well on the contours disjoint to the projection. Positive semantics for a projection is produced by a novel Ga ussi n-like elimination process for solving set equations. In dealing with multiple projections of the same base set, we introduce yet another extension to Venn-Euler diagrams in which the same set can be described by multiple contours. This extension is of independent interest as a powerful means for reducing the clutter in Venn-Euler diagrams.

We analyse the dualization notion in depth. An example is the concept of autonomous (which, usually in the presence of a symmetry, also has been called """"rigid"""" or """"compact"""") monoidal category. The antipode of a quasi-Hopf algebra H in the sense of Drinfeld [Maj] is another example obtained using a different base monoidal bicategory. We define right autonomous monoidal functors and their higher-dimensional analogue. Our explanation of why the category Comodf (H) of finite dimensional representations of H is autonomous is that the Comodf operation is autonomous and so preserves dualization."""	autonomous robot;monoidal t-norm logic	Brian Day;Paddy McCrudden;Ross Street	2003	Applied Categorical Structures	10.1023/A:1024236601870	symmetric monoidal category;discrete mathematics;topology;closed monoidal category;hopf algebra;mathematics;enriched category;algebra	Logic	42.04103667206012	27.31938895271818	52411

bd0cb92d6099bd1ae26acbabf71edb932c8ccd8b	weighted paths between partitions		Developing from a concern in bioinformatics, this paper analyses alternative metrics between partitions. From both theoretical and applicative perspectives, a seemingly most appropriate distance between any two partitions is HD, which counts the number of atoms finer than either one but not both. While faithfully reproducing the traditional Hamming distance between subsets, HD is very sensible and easily computable through scalar products between Boolean vectors. Also, it properly deals with complements and axiomatically resembles the (entropy-based) variation of information VI distance. Entire families of metrics (including both HD and VI) obtain as minimal paths in the weighted graph given by the Hasse diagram: submodular weighting functions yield path-based distances visiting the join (of any two partitions), whereas supermodularity leads to visit the meet. This also provides an exact (rather than heuristic) approach to the consensus partition (combinatorial optimization) problem.	applicative programming language;bioinformatics;combinatorial optimization;computable function;computational complexity theory;concave function;consensus (computer science);embedded system;entropy (information theory);first-order predicate;hamming distance;hasse diagram;heuristic;irreducibility;matching (graph theory);mathematical optimization;mikumikudance;molecular dynamics;partition function (mathematics);partition type;statistical classification;submodular set function;supermodular function;value (ethics);variation of information	Giovanni Rossi	2015	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	ML	42.63913724248642	18.662849350703222	53689

It is known that the second Betti number of  k [Δ] is independent of the base field  k . We show that, when the ideal  I  Δ  is generated by square-free monomials of degree two, the third and fourth Betti numbers are also independent of  k . On the other hand, we prove that, if the geometric realization of Δ is homeomorphic to either the 3-sphere or the 3-ball, then all the Betti numbers of  k [Δ] are independent of the base field  k .	betti number;the stanley parable	Naoki Terai;Takayuki Hibi	1996	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/S0012-365X(96)83021-4	betti number;combinatorics;topology;mathematics;geometry;betti's theorem;simplicial complex	Theory	40.777781237596635	31.736815220289696	53915

These representatives are e actly the Schubert polynomials found in 2 . This new approach to nding Schubert polynomials is very closely related to the geometry of the ag manifold and has the advantage that it does not require e plicit computations with divided di erence operators. The generalized transition equations also lead to a recursion for Stanley symmetric functions and a new proof of Chevalley s intersection formula for Schubert varieties. The proofs involve a careful study of the Bruhat order for the Weyl groups and two simple lemmas for applying divided di erence operators.	computation;polynomial;recursion;stanley (vehicle);stanley symmetric function;wigner–weyl transform	Sara C.

The theoretical foundation for most of existing studies of CS is a stable embedding (i.e., a distance-preserving property) of certain low-dimensional signal models such as sparse signals or signals in a union of linear subspaces. However, few existing literatures clearly discussed the embedding effect of points on the Grassmann manifold in under-sampled linear measurement systems. In this paper, we explore the stable embedding property of multi-dimensional signals based on Grassmann manifold, which is a topological space with each point being a linear subspace of ℝN (or ℂN), via the Gaussian random matrices. It should be noted that the stability mentioned here is about the volume-preserving instead of distance-preserving, because volume is the key characteristic for linear subspace spanned by multiple vectors. The theorem of the volume-preserving stable embedding property is proposed, and sketched proofs as well as discussions about our theorem is also given.	compressed sensing;manifold regularization;measure-preserving dynamical system;sparse matrix;statistical manifold;system of measurement;with high probability	Hailong Shi;Hao Zhang;Gang Li;Xiqin Wang	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2014.6875310	gaussian random field;combinatorics;topology;mathematics;geometry	Theory	51.285983713241684	19.000328416788875	54869

The most promising candidate for applications needing entanglement in the full Hilbert space is the ent-concurrence, which detects all nonlocal correlations while distinguishing between different types of distinctly multipartite entanglement, and simplifies to the concurrence for two-qubit mixed states. For applications where subsystems need internal entanglement, we develop the absolute ent-concurrence which detects the entanglement in the reduced states as well as the full state.	multipartite entanglement;quantum entanglement	Samuel R.

We investigate conditions on A and R which are sufficient and necessary for DgA(R) to contain every Turing degree.

Also, very recently, Kieu Phuong Chi and Tran Van An [K.P. Chi, T. Van An, Dugundji’s theorem for cone metric spaces, Appl. Math. Lett. (2010)  doi:10.1016/j.aml.2010.10.034 ] proved Dugundji’s extension theorem for the normal cone metric space. The aim of this paper is to prove this in the frame of the tvs-cone spaces in which the cone does not need to be normal. Examples are given to illustrate the results.		Suzana Simic	2011	Appl. Math.

In the present paper, we describe a simplification of this computation that uses an abelian heap structure on this set that was observed in another paper [5] of the author. A heap is essentially a group without a choice of its neutral element; in addition, we allow it to be empty.	heap (data structure);map;symbolic computation	Lukás Vokrínek	2013	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;heap;computation;heap;mathematics;n-connected;algebra	NLP	42.12351428677965	29.10497460229339	56972

Über positive darstellung von polynomen vierteljschr. In Naturforsch. Ges. Zürich, 73: 141-145, 1928]. We show that if a homogeneous polynomial is positive over the intersection of the non-negative orthant and a given basic semialgebraic cone (excluding the origin), then there exists a “Pólya type” certificate for non-negativity. The proof of this result uses the original Positivstellensatz by Pólya, and a Positivstellensatz by Putinar and Vasilescu [Mihai Putinar and FlorianHoria Vasilescu.

16e4d8955c334abb5cf897fa550b8e58951323ad	on the uniform nonsingularity property for linear transformations on euclidean jordan algebras		In a recent paper, Chua and Yi introduced the so-called uniform nonsingularity property for a nonlinear transformation on a Euclidean Jordan algebra and showed that it implies the global uniqueness property in the context of symmetric cone complementarity problems. In a related paper, Chua, Lin, and Yi raise the question of converse. In this paper, we show that, for linear transformations, the uniform nonsingularity property is inherited by principal subtransformations and, on simple algebras, it is invariant under the action of cone automorphisms. Based on these results, we answer the question of Chua, Lin, and Yi in the negative.	chua's circuit;complementarity (physics);complementarity theory;local interconnect network;nonlinear system	Roman Sznajder;M.

Using a special form of recursive topological spaces, called partition spaces, we define a recursive topology which uses a level of partition for approximation of arbitrary objects instead of the usual metric. It is shown that the formulation for arbitrary objects satisfies most of the previous results obtained usually for natural numbers and for sequences of symbols. Thus we claim the existence of abstract computers formalizes the idea that many real-life objects may, in fact, be calculated (or approximated) effectively. We also show the existence of a universal probability measure for our arbitrary objects.	kolmogorov complexity	Aaron J. Shenhar	1993	J.

Symmetrical chaotic attractors are generated by using a random iteration scheme. This method can be used to create a great variety of exotic symmetrical patterns.	triangle group	K. W. Chung;B. N.

10c8ad573c234a7879af0096a3276203e0aaddfe	shimura curves of genus at most two	calcul scientifique;analisis numerico;shimura curve;analyse numerique;computacion cientifica;numerical analysis;scientific computation	We enumerate all Shimura curves XD 0 (N) of genus at most two: there are exactly 858 such curves, up to equivalence. The elliptic modular curve X0(N) is the quotient of the completed upper halfplane H∗ by the congruence subgroup Γ0(N) of matrices in SL2(Z) that are upper triangular modulo N ∈ Z>0. The curve X0(N) forms a coarse moduli space for (generalized) elliptic curves equipped with a cyclic subgroup of order N . Modular curves have been studied in great detail on account of their importance in many fields, especially arithmetic geometry and the theory of automorphic forms. The genus of X0(N) goes to infinity with N according to an explicit formula [6, Chapter 3], [5]: for example, X0(N) has genus at most two if and only if N ≤ 29 or N ∈ {31, 32, 36, 37, 49, 50}. Equations for modular curves of small genus have been explicitly determined in many cases [21]. In this paper, we consider these results in the context of Shimura curves, which are generalizations of modular curves. A Shimura curve X 0 (N) is the quotient of the (completed) upper half-plane H by the congruence arithmetic Fuchsian group Γ0 (N) ⊂ PSL2(R), which is specified by two coprime ideals of the ring of integers ZF of a totally real number field F : the discriminant D ⊂ ZF , a squarefree ideal such that n = [F : Q] and the number of prime factors of D have opposite parity, and the level N ⊂ ZF (see §1). The curves X 0 (N), like modular curves, can be seen as moduli spaces for certain classes of abelian varieties equipped with level structure. Taking F = Q, D = Z, and N = NZ, one recovers the modular curves as Shimura curves. In this article, we consider Shimura curves of small genus. In this vein, Long, Machlachlan, and Reid have proven the following theorem. Theorem (Long-Maclachlan-Reid [12]). There are only finitely many congruence arithmetic Fuchsian groups Γ of bounded genus, up to conjugacy. Already proving this statement in the simplest case—that there are only finitely many congruence subgroups of PSL2(Z) of genus 0—is a nontrivial result of Thompson [23] (see also Chua-Lang-Yang [2]). The proof of Long et al. combines lower and upper bounds due to Selberg and Zograf, respectively, for the first nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian of Γ (see §1 for precise statements), and thereby bounds the coarea of Γ in terms of the genus. The restriction to congruence subgroups is necessary: indeed, by the theory of Belyi covers, every curve defined over a number field is already uniformized by some subgroup of PSL2(Z), since PSL2(Z) contains Γ(2), a free group on two generators. By comparison, however, Takeuchi [22] has proven that there are only finitely many arithmetic Fuchsian groups with any fixed signature, and for certain simple signatures all such groups have been identified (see e.g. Machlachlan-Rosenberger [14]).	chua's circuit;congruence of squares;discriminant;enumerated type;fuchsian group;genus (mathematics);hilbert space;level structure;mathematics subject classification;mathematics of sudoku;modulo operation;nx bit;triangular matrix;turing completeness;yang;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	John Voight	2009	Math.

ca44f6e89fbe111f162f258a176cb3148239da46	on the optimal pre-processing for non-profiling differential power analysis		Differential Power Analysis (DPA) is often preceded by various noise reduction techniques. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) have found their numerous applications in this area. However, most of them either require explicit profiling/semi-profiling step or depend on some heuristically chosen parameters. In this paper, we propose optimal pre-processing of power traces in non-profiling setup using an optimum linear filter and an approximate optimum linear filter. We have also empirically evaluated the proposed filters in several noisy scenarios which show significant improvements in the results of Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) over the existing pre-processing techniques. We have further investigated the optimality of the one proposed pre-processing technique by comparing it with a profiling attack.

The aim of the present paper is to characterize semi-abelian and regular protomodular categories among all regular categories C, via the form of subobjects of C, i.e. the functor C → Gls which assigns to each object X in C the ordered set Sub(X) of subobjects of X, and carries a morphism f : X → Y to the induced Galois connection Sub(X) → Sub(Y ) (where the left adjoint maps a subobject m of X to the regular image of f m, and the right adjoint is given by pulling back a subobject of Y along f ). Such functor amounts to a Grothendieck bifibration over C. The conditions which we use to characterize semi-abelian and regular protomodular categories can be stated as self-dual conditions on the bifibration corresponding to the form of subobjects. This development is closely related to the work of Grandis on “categorical foundations of homological and homotopical algebra”. In his work, forms appear as the so-called “transfer functors” which associate to an object the lattice of “normal subobjects” of an object, where “normal” is defined relative to an ideal of null morphism admitting kernels and cokernels.	semiconductor industry	Zurab Janelidze	2014	Applied Categorical Structures	10.1007/s10485-013-9355-2	discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;subobject classifier;algebra	Logic	41.445596033546	27.547382297728433	60089

In this paper, we develop a general metric for comparing nonlinear dynamical systems that is defined with Perron-Frobenius operators in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our metric includes the existing fundamental metrics for dynamical systems, which are basically defined with principal angles between some appropriately-chosen subspaces, as its special cases. We also describe the estimation of our metric from finite data.

No special relations to physics is compulsory.

In this paper we propose the basic notions of such a theory and some applications: we replace the classical notions of continuous function, homeomorphism and homotopic equivalence with the notions of NPP-function, NPP-local-isomorphism and NPP-homotopy (NPP stands for Nearest Point Preserving); we also introduce the notion of NPP-isomorphism. We construct three invariants under NPP-isomorphisms and, in particular, we define the fundamental group of a locally finite metric space. As first applications, we propose the following: motivated by the longstanding question whether there is a purely metric condition which extends the notion of amenability of a group to any metric space, we propose the property SN (Small Neighborhood); motivated by some applicative problems in Computer Science, we prove the analog of the Jordan curve theorem in Z; motivated by a question asked during a lecture at Lausanne, we extend to any locally finite metric space a recent inequality of P.N.Jolissaint and Valette regarding the lp-distortion.	applicative programming language;computer science;distortion;invariant (computer science);mathematical chemistry;social inequality;topological graph theory;turing completeness	Valerio Capraro	2011	CoRR		convex metric space;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;real line;injective metric space;topology;fubini–study metric;metric differential;product metric;metric;fisher information metric;metric k-center;metric space;word metric;graph theory;intrinsic metric;ultrametric space;mathematics;geometry;equivalence of metrics;topological space;fundamental group;bounded set;general topology;pseudometric space;metric map;algebra;net	Theory	45.359457431009346	23.853648883433856	61246

The group F is an interesting finitely presented group with a pleasant, faithful representation in the group PLo(I) of orientation preserving, piecewise linear, self homeomorphisms of the unit interval. Thus our subgroups also lie in PLo(I). The subgroups we construct are all elementary amenable of a certain bounded degree (see Section 1.2 for definitions) while F is not elementary amenable. Thus the complexities of the subgroups that we construct are in some sense strictly less than that of F itself and we raise the question of whether there are subgroups of PLo(I) that are in the gap between the groups we construct and the group F . We also raise (and give specific meaning to) the question of whether F is the “only” subgroup of PLo(I) that is not elementary amenable. See Conjecture 3. The group F originated with Thompson in his studies in algebraic logic [29], was independently discovered as the key behind interesting examples in shape and homotopy theory [14], [13], [15], can be called the “structure group” of the associative law [12], and arises in a fundamental way in the theory of diagram groups [20]. It is also the source of difficult questions, the most prominent of which is whether F is amenable [16]. See [8] and [5, Section 4] for an introduction to Thompson’s groups.	diagram;elementary;linear algebra;piecewise linear continuation	Matthew G.

We invoke the Hausdorff metric to define the metric between two fuzzy numbers, and then to consider the limit of a sequence of fuzzy numbers. In the meantime, we define the supremum and infimum of a sequence of fuzzy numbers. In this setting, the meaning of convergence of a sequence of fuzzy-valued integrals becomes clear; thus we can prove the Monotone Convergence Theorem, Fatou's Lemma and the Dominated Convergence Theorem. Furthermore, the α-level set of this fuzzy-valued integral is a closed interval whose end points are the classical Lebesgue integrals, which are more tractable.

Its full subcategory of M-extensive K-Chu spaces is topological over X when X is Mcomplete, for any morphism class M. Often this subcategory may be presented as a full coreflective subcategory of Diers’ category of affine K-spaces. Hence, in addition to their roots in the theory of pairs of topological vector spaces (Barr) and their connections with linear logic (Seely), the Dialectica categories (Hyland, de Paiva), and with the study of event structures for modeling concurrent processes (Pratt), Chu spaces seem to have a less explored link with algebraic geometry. We use the Zariski closure operator to describe the objects of the ∗-autonomous category of M-extensive and Mcoextensive K-Chu spaces in terms of Zariski separation and to identify its important subcategory of complete objects.	knuth–morris–pratt algorithm;lawrence a. hyland;linear algebra;linear logic;spaces	Eraldo Giuli;Walter Tholen	2007	Applied Categorical Structures	10.1007/s10485-007-9111-6	linear logic;topological vector space;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;algebraic geometry;mathematics;closure operator;algebra	Logic	41.82577279900661	27.952527658745733	62866

This makes it a very effective class of shape descriptors, with an impressive potential for applications in the image context, in particular when it comes to images of natural origin. Research in this field is lively and follows various threads.

Homology generators corresponding to these features are represented by nontrivial 0– cycles, 1–cycles and 2–cycles, respectively. In the framework of cubical representation of digital volumes with the topology that corresponds to the 26–connectivity between voxels, we introduce a method for algorithmic computation of a coproduct operation that can be used to decompose 2–cycles into products of 1–cycles (possibly trivial). This coproduct provides means of classifying different kinds of cavities; in particular, it allows to distinguish certain homotopically non-equivalent spaces that have isomorphic homology. We define this coproduct at the level of a cubical complex built directly upon voxels of the digital image, and we construct it by means of the classical Alexander-Whitney map on a simplicial subdivision of faces of the voxels.	computation;connected component (graph theory);digital image;homology (biology);homology modeling;subdivision surface;voxel	Ainhoa Berciano;Helena Molina-Abril;Ana Pacheco;Pawel Pilarczyk;Pedro Real Jurado	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04397-0_23	three-dimensional space;homology;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;vector field;relative homology;connected component;topology;mathematics;geometry;digital image	Graphics	39.622865129991425	22.320704043268535	63698

We introduce the “contiguity complex”, a simplicial complex of maps between simplicial complexes defined in terms of the combinatorial notion of contiguity. We generalize the Simplicial Approximation Theorem to show that the contiguity complex approximates the homotopy type of the mapping space as we subdivide the domain. We describe algorithms for approximating the rate of growth of the components of the contiguity complex under subdivision of the domain; this procedure allows us to computationally distinguish spaces with isomorphic homology but different homotopy types.	approximation algorithm;homology (biology);map;persistence (computer science);simplicial complex;subdivision surface;topological data analysis	Andrew J.

Starting out from the homotopies (Everitt 2004), we convert them into deck operations, acting on the simply connected three-sphere as the cover, and obtain the corresponding variety of deck groups. For each topology, the three-sphere is tiled into copies of a fundamental domain under the corresponding deck group. We employ the point symmetry of each Platonic manifold to construct its fundamental domain as a spherical orbifold. While the three-sphere supports an orthonormal complete basis for harmonic analysis formed by Wigner polynomials, a given spherical orbifold leads to a selection of a specific subbasis. The resulting selection rules find applications in cosmic topology, probed by the cosmic microwave background.	basis set (chemistry);cosmic;coefficient;encode;fundamental domain;microwave;network topology;numerical analysis;polynomial;selection rule;type signature;wigner–weyl transform	Peter Kramer	2015	Symmetry	10.3390/sym7020305	combinatorics;topology;mathematics;geometry;quantum mechanics	Logic	49.579685469263644	23.394625574036358	64126

Whitney numbers of the second kind of the corresponding subposet which constitute Stirling-like numbers’  triangular array — are then calculated and the explicit formula for them is provided. Next — in the second construction —  we endow the set sums of prefabiants with such an another partial order that their Bell-like numbers include Fibonacci triad  sequences introduced recently by the present author in order to extend famous relation between binomial Newton coefficients  and Fibonacci numbers onto the infinity of their relatives among whom there are also the Fibonacci triad sequences and binomial-like  coefficients (incidence coefficients included). The first partial order is F-sequence independent while the second partial order is F-sequence dependent where F is the so-called admissible sequence determining cobweb poset by construction. An F-determined cobweb poset’s Hasse diagram becomes Fibonacci tree sheathed with specific cobweb if the sequence F is chosen to be just the Fibonacci sequence. From the stand-point of linear algebra of formal series these are generating  functions which stay for the so-called extended coherent states of quantum physics. This information is delivered in the last  section.		A. Krzysztof Kwasniewski	2008	CoRR			NLP	39.25381077770111	32.15792523690242	65389

We use these constructions for an alternative, short proof for theM,N -adhesiveness of partially labelled graphs. We further present a new concept of attributed graphs and show that the corresponding category is M,N adhesive. As a consequence, we inherit all nice properties for M,N adhesive systems such as the Local Church-Rosser Theorem, the Parallelism Theorem, and the Concurrency Theorem for this type of attributed graphs.	church–rosser theorem	Christoph Peuser;Annegret Habel	2015			combinatorics;nice;concurrency;attribution;adhesive;mathematics;composition (visual arts);graph	Logic	41.679455115082675	28.480835876508703	65394

The seminar brought together researchers interested in the fundamental questions of similarity and correspondence across geometric data sets, which include collections of GPS traces, images, 3D shapes and other types of geometric data. A recent trend, emerging independently in multiple theoretical and applied communities, is to understand networks of geometric data sets through their relations and interconnections, a point of view that can be broadly described as exploiting the functoriality of data, which has a long tradition associated with it in mathematics. Functoriality, in its broadest form, is the notion that in dealing with any kind of mathematical object, it is at least as important to understand the transformations or symmetries possessed by the object or the family of objects to which it belongs, as it is to study the object itself. This general idea has led to deep insights into the structure of various geometric spaces as well as to state-of-the-art methods in various application domains. The talks spanned a wide array of subjects under the common theme of functoriality, including: the analysis of geometric collections, optimal transport for geometric datasets, deep learning applications and many more."""

The two cases are distinguished interpreting the unitary Not as a quantum realization of the classical gate which on a fixed orthogonal pair of unit vectors, realizing once for all the classical bits 0 and 1, produces the required transformations 0→ 1 and 1→ 0 (i.e., logical quantum Not). The anti–unitary Not is a quantum realization of a gate which acts as a classical Not on any pair of mutually orthogonal vectors, each of which is a potential realization of the classical bits (i.e., universal quantum Not). Although the latter is not completely positive, one can give an approximated unitary realization of the gate by appending an ancilla. Finally, we consider the unitary and the anti–unitary operator realizations of two important genuine quantum gates that transform elements of the computational basis of C into its superpositions: the square root of the identity and the square root of the Not.	alexander horned sphere;anti-aliasing filter;artificial neural network;bohr–einstein debates;complementarity (physics);controlled not gate;hilbert space;inverter (logic gate);logic gate;logical relations;map;mutual exclusion;observable;physical information;quantum information;quantum mechanics;quantum state;quantum superposition;quantum system;qubit;theory of computation;universality probability	Gianpiero Cattaneo;Graziana Conte;Roberto Leporini	2010	CoRR		quantum operation;quantum fourier transform;no-teleportation theorem;quantum information;sic-povm;quantum t-design;amplitude damping channel;quantum network;quantum capacity;no-cloning theorem;pure mathematics;controlled not gate;quantum circuit;mathematics;quantum channel;quantum computer;classical capacity;quantum process;quantum algorithm;physics;quantum mechanics;quantum phase estimation algorithm;algebra;quantum gate;quantum error correction	Theory	50.19716935089966	24.73564658742779	66272

There are regular sequences for which there is general agreement on how to continue. However, there are less regular sequences for which this assessment is less certain. There are sequences for which every continuation is perceived to be arbitrary. I would like to present a mathematical model that reflects these opinions and perceptions with the aid of a valuation function.

In particular, we present the general regular solution to Cauchy’s additive functional equation on restricted lower-dimensional convex domains. This provides a k-dimensional generalization of the so-called Interval Lemma, allowing us to deduce affine properties of the function from certain additivity relations. Next, we study the discrete geometry of additivity domains of piecewise linear functions, providing a framework for finite tests of minimality and extremality. We then give a theory of non-extremality certificates in the form of perturbation functions. We apply these tools in the context of minimal valid functions for the two-dimensional infinite group problem that are piecewise linear on a standard triangulation of the plane, under a regularity condition called diagonal constrainedness. We show that the extremality of a minimal valid function is equivalent to the extremality of its restriction to a certain finite two-dimensional group problem. This gives an algorithm for testing the extremality of a given minimal valid function. Date: Revision: 2090 − Date: 2016-07-28 16:56:14 -0400 (Thu, 28 Jul 2016).

d242be81c08d07028bdc9dcf8ed11dd918b240b7	constructive order types, ii		Publisher Summary This chapter explains constructive order types. The theory of constructive order types constitutes a new approach to the problem of providing a constructive analogue of ordinal number theory. Ordinal number theory may be approached in two ways: (1) ordinals may be considered as being generated in a certain way, and (2) ordinals may be regarded as the equivalence classes of well-ordered sets under (arbitrary) one-one order-preserving maps (isotonisms). The chapter defines constructive order types as equivalence classes of (linear) orderings under effective one-one order-preserving maps (recursive isotonisms). Co-ordinals are the equivalence classes of well-orderings obtained under recursive isotonisms. As there are only denumerably infinitely many recursive isotonisms, co-ordinals are, in general, proper sub-classes of the corresponding classical ordinals.		John Newsome Crossley	1966	J. Symb.

2f153b634a725e1b464052640cb8860bd6a6d140	a resource theory for work and heat		Several recent results in the field of quantum thermodynamics have been obtained using the tools of quantum information theory and resource theories. So far, the resource theories utilised to describe quantum thermodynamics have assumed the existence of an infinite thermal reservoir, by declaring that thermal states at some background temperature come for free. Here, we propose a resource theory of quantum thermodynamics without a background temperature, so that no states at all come for free. In this resource theory, we show that states are classified up to many-copy equivalence by their entropy and average energy, which implies that thermodynamics takes place in a two-dimensional convex set that we call the energy-entropy diagram. The answers to many resource-theoretic questions about thermodynamics can be read off from this diagram, such as the efficiency of a heat engine consisting of finite reservoirs or the rate of conversion between two states. This allows us to consider a resource theory which puts work and heat on an equal footing, and serves as a model for more general resource theories.	convex set;information diagram;information theory;quantum information;quantum thermodynamics;turing completeness	Carlo Sparaciari;Jonathan Oppenheim;Tobias Fritz	2016	CoRR		theoretical physics;mathematics;thermodynamics;physics;quantum mechanics	Theory	51.284632046340285	23.20366750219448	67802

These are the structural measures, defined recursively over the program or flowgraph decomposition into sequences of prime flowgraphs, nested level-by-level. The theory of hierarchical metrics is generalised and extended well beyond its original framework, introducing a notion of convexity that permits combinations of (generalised) hierarchical metrics to be studied, so that weights can be given to various software attributes of interest to the individual investigator. It is found that certain concepts, for example those of independence and rank, that have their roots in linear algebra are applicable here. Examples are described that show the range of application of these fundamental notions.	software metric	Ronald E.

The morphology of a nonsingular algebraic curve means the structural (or topological) information about the curve, such as the number of disjoint connected components of the curve in PR (the 3D real projective space), and whether a particular component is a compact set in any affine realization of PR. For example, we show that two quadrics intersect along a nonsingular space quartic curve in PR with one connected component if and only if their characteristic equation has two distinct real roots and a pair of complex conjugate roots. Since the number of the real roots of the characteristic equation can be counted robustly with exact arithmetic, our results can be used to obtain structural information reliably before computing the parameterization of the intersection curve; thus errors in the subsequent computation that is most likely done using floating point arithmetic will not lead to erroneous topological classification of the intersection curve. The key technique used to prove our results is to reduce two quadrics into simple forms using a projective transformation, a technique equivalent to the simultaneous block diagonalization of two real symmetric matrices, a topic that has been studied in matrix algebra.	characteristic polynomial;computation;connected component (graph theory);discriminant;linear algebra;mathematical morphology	Changhe Tu;Wenping Wang;Jiaye Wang	2002		10.1109/GMAP.2002.1027493	intersection curve;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;jacobian curve;computational geometry;floating point;mathematics;geometry	Theory	41.520142149334774	32.29520483740735	68451

Hamilton and J. A. Thas describe a link between maximal arcs of Mathon type and partial flocks of the quadratic cone. This link is of a rather algebraic nature. In this paper we establish a geometric connection between these two structures. We also define a composition on the flock planes and use this to work out an analogue of the synthetic version of Mathon’s Theorem (see [3]). Finally, we show how it is possible to construct a maximal arc of Mathon type of degree 2d, containing a Denniston arc of degree d provided that there is a solution to a certain given system of trace conditions.	flock;flocking (behavior);maximal set;synthetic data	Frank De Clerck;Stefaan De Winter;Thomas Maes	2012	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2012.04.028	combinatorics;topology;mathematics;geometry	Theory	39.45002322098369	26.103393657238865	68575

The weak one-way deficit for Werner state is obtained analytically. We find that weak one-way deficit is smaller than the standard one-way deficit, which contrasts with a straightforward expectation based on the known fact that super-quantum discord by weak measurement is always larger than the quantum discord defined by projective measurement. On the other hand, by tuning the weak measurement continuously to the projective measurement, both weak one-way deficit and super-quantum discord converge to the same value, which is either the one-way deficit or the quantum discord both quantifying quantum correlation. In this sense, weak measurement does not necessarily capture more quantumness of correlations. We also give the geometry of super-quantum discord of the Bell-diagonal states with explicit geometrical figures. As an application, the dynamic behavior of super-quantum correlation including super-quantum discord and weak one-way deficit under decoherence is investigated. We find that the order relation of the super-quantum correlation and the quantum correlation remained unchanged under the phase flipping channel for the Bell-diagonal states and the Werner states.	quantum correlation;weak measurement	Yao-Kun Wang;Teng Ma;Heng Fan;Shao-Ming Fei;Zhi-Xi Wang	2014	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-013-0649-y	calculus;mathematics;weak measurement;condensed matter physics;physics;quantum mechanics	Theory	49.54229215446766	21.08724717320593	68770
589ac3a43c79285dbce30f41ae6d72b21122ca2a	pointlike sets for varieties determined by groups		For a variety of finite groups $\mathbf H$, let $\overline{\mathbf H}$ denote the variety of finite semigroups all of whose subgroups lie in $\mathbf H$. We give a characterization of the subsets of a finite semigroup that are pointlike with respect to $\overline{\mathbf H}$. Our characterization is effective whenever $\mathbf H$ has a decidable membership problem. In particular, the separation problem for $\overline{\mathbf H}$-languages is decidable for any decidable variety of finite groups $\mathbf H$. This generalizes Henckell's theorem on decidability of aperiodic pointlikes.	krohn–rhodes theory	Samuel Jacob van Gool;Benjamin Steinberg	2018	CoRR		aperiodic graph;mathematical analysis;semigroup;pure mathematics;mathematics;decidability	Theory	41.28436152715983	28.75735470616711	68906

Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of strong and superstrong vertices in intuitionistic fuzzy graphs are discussed. Necessary and sufficient conditions for an edge to be strong in intuitionistic fuzzy graphs are also dealt and the existence of strong and superstrong vertices in strong IFGs are studied.

Whether formal concepts and concept lattice can be generated in topological space for objects set G or attributes set Mof a formal context F = (G,M,I) is an interesting problem. In this paper, our discussions are concentrated on constructing a topology for M of F, the topology is generated by an approximation space on M. Then there exists one-to-one mapping between the approximation space on M and the topology for M, and it is obtained that attributes of each formal concept is open set in the topological space.

Recent observations of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of alkali atoms, containing odd number of electrons, require some explanation, which also must be based on a correct permutational symmetry of a system, containing different types of fermions. In the framework of the same reduced density matrix formalism, it is proved that aggregates (atoms), containing even number 2f of fermions, can be condensed only in a mixed quantum state in contrast to elementary bosons because a natural occupation number λ is proved to be strictly smaller than their total sum. If fermions are absent in aggregates the reduction of sum of λ to one term becomes possible. The upper bound λ$_{max}$ for a macroscopic ensemble of n aggregates, built of m different sorts of fermions is shown to be $m^1[((2f-1)!!)^3 A/(2f)!!B]^{1/2}$ where A is the number of all possible aggregates in a system, B is the number of ways to form a given composition of an aggregate from 2f-fermions of m sorts; n is a macroscopic greatest common devisor of fermion numbers of all sorts.#R##N##R##N#The bound λ$_{max}$ increases as $n^{f}$, while sum of λ grows as $n^{2f}$. The evenness of the total number of fermions 2f in an aggregate is a necessary and sufficient condition for BEC formation. In particular, the number N of neutrons in neutral atom must be even because of the integrity of f=Z+N/2. The extreme type wave function is built, for which λ is arbitrary close to n$^{f}$ that proves the sufficiency of this criterion. The occupation maximum is achieved when pairs of fermions (identical or different) are condensed independently. The possibility of condensation of bound aggregates only (atoms) is shown arising from nonoverlapping of wave functions of electron relative coordinates of different atoms. This conclusion is based on separation of the centers' of mass motion, which are proved behaving like a bosonic gas. The remaining product of identical atomic wave functions of relative coordinates, which determine main properties of condensate ingredients, is shown not requiring further antisymmetrization that makes condensation possible.

c5f54e68f6ad2e7a86e9f6740e44ae7e0acbe8d0	on a new convergence class in k-bounded sober spaces		Recently, J. D. Lawson encouraged the domain theory community to consider the scientific program of developing domain theory in the wider context of T0 spaces instead of restricting to posets. In this paper, we respond to this calling by proving a topological parallel of a 2005 result due to B. Zhao and D. Zhao, i.e., an order-theoretic characterisation of those posets for which the lim-inf convergence is topological. We do this by adopting a recent approach due to D. Zhao and W. K. Ho by replacing directed subsets with irreducible sets. As a result, we formulate a new convergence class on T0 spaces called Irr-convergence and established that this convergence class I on a k-bounded sober space X is topological if and only if X is Irr-continuous.	domain theory;expanded memory;irreducibility	Hadrian Andradi;Weng Kin Ho	2016	CoRR		discrete mathematics;topology;artificial intelligence;modes of convergence;mathematics;algorithm	ML	40.303466121514845	27.030544125418132	72574

We here study the protection of quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the phase parameter in entangled-atom states within the framework of independently dissipative environments and driven individually by classical fields. It is shown that the QFI of the phase parameter can be protected effectively only when the classical fields that drive all atoms are suitably strong, and if one of them vanishes or is very weak, then the ability of protection loses, no matter how strong the other driving fields are. We also study the evolution of fidelity of the entangled state itself and find that though the protections of QFI and quantum states are two different notions, the method can also be used to protect quantum states effectively when the driving fields are suitably strong.	fisher information	Yu-Kun Ren;La-Mei Tang;Hao-Sheng Zeng	2016	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-016-1444-3	classical mechanics;condensed matter physics;physics;quantum mechanics	Theory	50.12982632608032	21.20926866544399	73148

First, we prove that the set of all fuzzy ideals of a commutative ring with appropriate operations is a [0, 1]-quantale. Furthermore, we discuss some properties of localic nuclei on Q-algebras, and show that the category of Q-algebras with the quantale structures being frames is a full reflective subcategory of the category of Q-algebras. From this result, we can conclude that the category of L-frames is a full reflective subcategory of the category of L-quantales, where L is a frame. Finally, we build and characterize the Q-quantale completions of a Q-ordered semigroup.	mv-algebra	Bin Zhao;Supeng Wu;Kaiyun Wang	2017	Soft Comput.	10.1007/s00500-016-2147-5	closed category;isomorphism-closed subcategory;discrete mathematics;pure mathematics;mathematics;category of rings;algebra	Logic	42.43381633397889	28.565433614304418	74905

6deb053c5733de8a04f50fa067322f829057e819	lifting elementary embeddings j: vlambda -> vlambda		We describe a fairly general procedure for preserving I3 embeddings j : Vλ → Vλ via λ-stage reverse Easton iterated forcings. We use this method to prove that, assuming the consistency of an I3 embedding, V = HOD is consistent with the theory ZFC + WA where WA is an axiom schema in the language {∈, j} asserting a strong but not inconsistent form of “there is an elementary embedding V → V”. This improves upon an earlier result in which consistency was established assuming an I1 embedding.	elementary;iteration;lifting scheme;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Paul Corazza	2007	Arch. Math.

Consequently, it is ample, and so coincides with both the free weakly ample and the free ample monoid FAM(X) on X . We introduce the notion of a semidirect product Y ∗ T of a monoid T acting doubly on a semilattice Y with identity. We argue that the free monoid X∗ acts doubly on the semilattice Y of idempotents of FIM(X) and that FAM(X) is embedded in Y ∗ X∗. Finally we show that every weakly E-ample monoid has a proper ample cover.	embedded system;free monoid	John Fountain;Gracinda M. S.

Although the structures thus obtained turn out to be termequivalent to Post algebras of order 3, the inclusion order between faces coincides with the De Luca-Termini sharpening order, and yields a compact coNP-complete logic that tolerates a modicum of inconsistency.	co-np;metropolis;metropolis–hastings algorithm	Daniele Mundici	2016	J.

We prove that the class of nondecreasing invariant functionals coincides with the class of Sugeno integrals associated with {0,1}-valued capacities, the so-called term functionals, thus extending previous results both to the infinitary case as well as to the realm of completely distributive lattices. Furthermore, we show that, in the case of functionals over complete chains, the nondecreasing condition is redundant. Characterizations of the class of Sugeno integrals, as well as its superclass comprising all polynomial functionals, are provided by showing that the axiomatizations (given in terms of homogeneity) of their restriction to finitary functionals still hold over completely distributive lattices. We also present canonical normal form representations of polynomial functionals on completely distributive lattices, which appear as the natural extensions to their finitary counterparts, and as a by-product we obtain an axiomatization of complete distributivity in the case of bounded lattices.

e302dce67437a1e5a4057af6c6c3c80e3a13f778	from gödel to einstein: computability between logic and physics at cie 2006		Computability in Europe (CiE) is an informal network of European scientists working on computability theory, including its foundations, technical development, and applications. Among the aims of the network is advancing our theoretical understanding of what can and cannot be computed, by any means of computation. Its scientific vision is broad: computations may be performed with discrete or continuous data by all kinds of algorithms, programs, and machines. Computations may be made by experimenting with any sort of physical system obeying the laws of a physical theory such as Newtonian mechanics, quantum theory or relativity. Computations may be very general, depending upon the foundations of set theory; or very specific, using the combinatorics of finite structures. CiE also works on subjects intimately related to computation, especially theories of data and information, and methods for formal reasoning about computations. The sources of new ideas and methods include practical developments in areas such as neural networks, quantum computation, natural computation, molecular computation, computational learning. Applications are everywhere, especially in algebra, analysis and geometry, or data types and programming. The conferences CiE 2005 in Amsterdam and CiE 2006 in Swansea are at the start of a new conference series CiE-CS that will reconvene in 2007 in Siena, 2008 in Athens, 2009 in Heidelberg and 2010 in Ponta Delgada (Açores). CiE 2006 focused on the variety of logical approaches to all kinds of computational barriers, like the practical and feasible ones, centered around the P vs. NP problem; the computable ones connected to models of computers and programming languages; and the hypercomputable ones. These three kinds of barriers are ubiquitous in computability theory: They occur in classical computability theory on discrete data; in computations with continuous data like higher types, real numbers or topological spaces; and in the physical sciences where we find for example quantum computers, analogue computers, and other computing systems based on classical, relativistic and quantum mechanics. The conference provided an interdisciplinary venue for researchers from computer science and mathematics to exchange ideas, approaches and techniques in their respective work, thereby generating a wider community for work	algorithm;artificial neural network;computability in europe;computability theory;computable function;computation;computer science;discrete mathematics;experiment;gödel;natural computing;obedience (human behavior);programming language;quantum mechanics;set theory;venue (sound system)	Arnold Beckmann;Edwin J.

Using this result we are able to give an alternate proof of Bochner’s theorem for translation invariant positive definite kernels on the real line (Rudin, 1962).

The interesting properties of our witness reveal that teleportation witness can be used to characterize mixed state entanglement using Schmidt numbers. Our results show that while every teleportation witness is also a entanglement witness, the converse is not true. Also, we show that a hermitian operator is a teleportation witness iff it is a decomposable entanglement witness. In addition, we analyze the practical significance of our study by decomposing our teleportation witness in terms of Pauli and Gell-Mann matrices, which are experimentally measurable quantities.	entanglement witness;experiment;mahdiyar;quantum entanglement;quantum state;quantum teleportation;schmidt decomposition;the witness;tomography	Atul Kumar;Satyabrata Adhikari;Pankaj Agrawal	2013	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-013-0539-3	discrete mathematics;entanglement witness;mathematics;quantum mechanics	ML	40.8041123143778	26.64953103758964	78260

Different types of noisy channels with memory, such as amplitude damping, phase-damping, and depolarizing channels effect on quantum coherence have been discussed in detail. The results show that, quantum channels with memory can efficiently protect coherence from noisy channels. Particularly, as channels with perfect memory, quantum coherence is unaffected by the phase damping as well as depolarizing channels. Besides, we also investigate the cohering and decohering power of quantum channels with memory.	coherence (physics);quantum channel;qubit	You-neng Guo;Qinglong Tian;Ke Zeng;Zheng-da Li	2017	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-017-1749-x	quantum operation;coherence;quantum discord;quantum capacity;optics;condensed matter physics;physics;quantum mechanics;quantum error correction	HPC	50.166979314576885	21.261315632131375	78594

Then a question arises: How to detect whether a state is entangled or not? If ρ is entangled, how to quantify the degree of its entanglement? To answer these two questions, we need to introduce some measures of entanglement to quantify the degree of entanglement. The entanglement measure for a state is zero iff the state is separable, and the bigger is the entanglement measure, then more entanglement is the state. One of the most famous measures of entanglement is the concurrence [5] of two-qubit system.

We stablish a relationship between the quantum discord with a local observable (the quadrature variance for one subsystem) under the influence of scattering and phase fluctuation noise. For the pure states the quantum correlations are characterized by means of measurement induced disturbance (MID) with simultaneous quadrature measurements. In a scenario where homodyne conditional measurements are available we show that the MID provides an easy way to select optimal phases to obtain information of the maximal correlations in the channels. The quantum correlations of these entangled states with channel losses are quantitatively characterized with the quantum discord (QD) with a displaced qubit projector. We observe that as scattering increases, QD decreases monotonically. At the same time for the state (mathinner {|{psi }rangle }_{text {dp}}), QD is more resistant to high phase fluctuations when the average photon number (n_0) is bigger than zero, but if phase fluctuations are low, QD is more resistant if (n_0=0). For the dp model with scattering, we obtain an analytical expression of the QD as a function of the observable quadrature variance in a local subsystem. This relation allows us to have a way to obtain the degree of QD in the channel by just measuring a local property observable such as the quadrature variance. For the other model this relation still exists but is explored numerically. This relation is an important result that allows to identify quantum processing capabilities in terms of just local observables.	quantum discord;universal conductance fluctuations	Francisco A.

The generalized power series ring R[[S]] is a common generalization of polynomial rings, Laurent polynomial rings, power series rings, Laurent series rings, Mal'cev–Neumann series rings, monoid rings and group rings. In this paper, we examine which conditions on R and S are necessary and which are sufficient for the generalized power series ring R[[S]] to be semilocal right Bezout or semilocal right distributive. In the case where S is a strictly totally ordered monoid we characterize generalized power series rings R[[S]] that are semilocal right distributive or semilocal right Bezout (the latter under the additional assumption that S is not a group).

f3a1349c9628e7db77efe9dcffd42fa936b44181	random walks on simplicial complexes and the normalized hodge laplacian		Modeling complex systems and data with graphs has been a mainstay of the applied mathematics community. The nodes in the graph represent entities and the edges model the relations between them. Simplicial complexes, a mathematical object common in topological data analysis, have emerged as a model for multi-nodal interactions that occur in several complex systems; for example, biological interactions occur between a set of molecules rather than just two, and communication systems can have group messages and not just person-to-person messages. While simplicial complexes can model multi-nodal interactions, many ideas from network analysis concerning dynamical processes lack a proper correspondence in the a simplicial complex model. In particular, diffusion processes and random walks, which underpin large parts of the network analysis toolbox including centrality measures and ranking, community detection, and contagion models, have so far been only scarcely studied for simplicial complexes. Here we develop a diffusion process on simplicial complexes that can serve as a foundation for making simplicial complex models more effective. Our key idea is to generalize the well-known relationship between the normalized graph Laplacian operator and random walks on graphs by devising an appropriate normalization for the Hodge Laplacian, the analog of the graph Laplacian for simplicial complexes. We demonstrate how our diffusion process can be used for system analysis by developing a generalization of PageRank for edges in simplicial complexes and analyzing a book co-purchasing dataset.	centrality;complex systems;entity;interaction;laplacian matrix;pagerank;purchasing;simplicial complex;social network analysis;system analysis;topological data analysis;whole earth 'lectronic link	Michael T.

It is therefore essential to find algorithms and programs which can generate arbitrary Kochen-Specker sets in a nearly-exhaustive manner. In this paper we present such generations for two new classes of Kochen-Specker sets. All sets from one of the classes are completely invisible to standard algorithms and programs from the literature as well as the upper part of sets from the second class. We also describe the methods and programs we used to obtain the sets on supercomputing clusters.	algorithm;british undergraduate degree classification;computation;computer cluster;kochen–specker theorem;quantum computing;quantum information;rough set;supercomputer	Norman D.

The method uses the rank distance (Dinu, 2003), a metric which measures the similarity between two hierarchies based on the ranks of objects. We define the aggregation of n hierarchies as the classification for which the sum of distances from it to each of the n hierarchies is minimal. We study some of his rationality properties and propose some open problems.	categorization	Liviu P. Dinu	2003	Fundam.

Andrews we derive new representations for the celebrated Madelung constant and various of its analytic relatives. The method leads to connections with the modern theory of multiple zeta sums, generates an apparently entire “ series” representation, and, for the Madelung constant in particular, yields a finite-integral representation. These analyses suggest variants of the Andrews identity, leading in turn to number-theoretical results concerning sums of three squares.	identity 3.0;madelung constant	Richard E.

One was obtained by Bollobas in 1973 and the other was obtained by Greene, Katona and Kleitman in 1976. By introducing a new family of non-negative real valued set functions and applying cyclic permutation approach, a family of more general inequalities is obtained. The left-hand sides of the inequalities of Bollobas and Greene et al. are just the two extreme values of a linear function which appears in the left-hand side of one of our special family of inequalities. Furthermore, some new inequalities are provided.		Changyu Wang;Huishan Zhou	1996	Eur. J.

In the first part of the paper, we start with a small category S and a maximal object s of S and construct a recollement of Mod-S in terms of Mod-EndS(s) and Mod-(S \ {s}) in four different levels. In case S is a finite directed category, by iterating this argument, we get chains of recollements having some interesting applications. In the second part, we start with a recollement of rings and construct a recollement of their path rings, with respect to a finite quiver. Third part of the paper presents some applications, including recollements of triangular matrix rings, an example of a recollement in Gorenstein derived level and recollements of derived categories of N -complexes.	maximal set;quiver;triangular matrix	Javad Asadollahi;Rasool Hafezi;Razieh Vahed	2016	Applied Categorical Structures	10.1007/s10485-015-9399-6	discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;algebra	NLP	40.896443099415215	29.34869137180513	82772

dd6c4701d82e8f92ea8a6d5a6e585ffad9fa6b25	completely compact elements and atoms of rough sets		Rough set theory established by Pawlak in 1982 plays an important role in dealing with uncertain information and to some extent overlaps fuzzy set theory. The key notions of rough set theory are approximation spaces of pairs (U,R) with R being an equivalence relation on U and approximation operators (underline{R}) and (overline{R}). Let (mathcal{R}) be the family {( (underline{R}X,overline{R}X)|X subseteq U)} of approximations endowed with the pointwise order of set-inclusion. It is known that (mathcal{R}) is a complete Stone lattice with atoms and is isomorphic to the family of rough sets in the approximation space (U, R). This paper is devoted to investigate algebraicity and completely distributivity of (mathcal{R}) from the view of domain theory. To this end, completely compact elements, compact elements and atoms of (mathcal{R}) are represented. In terms of the representations established in this paper, it is proved that (mathcal{R}) is isomorphic to a complete ring of sets, consequently (mathcal{R}) is a completely distributive algebraic lattice. An example is given to show that (mathcal{R}) is not atomic nor Boolean in general. Further, a sufficient and necessary condition for (mathcal{R}) being atomic is thus given.	rough set	Gaolin Li;Luoshan Xu	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22833-9_82	isomorphism;distributivity;equivalence relation;lattice (order);topology;rough set;ring of sets;mathematics;compact element;pointwise	HCI	43.13071332068799	25.640317119326742	82954

5c5751fe5023bc4c35645688474ab8cf75237314	efficient and robust persistent homology for measures	rips complex;persistent homology;distance to a measure	A new paradigm for point cloud data analysis has emerged recently, where point clouds are no longer treated as mere compact sets but rather as empirical measures. A notion of distance to such measures has been defined and shown to be stable with respect to perturbations of the measure. This distance can easily be computed pointwise in the case of a point cloud, but its sublevel-sets, which carry the geometric information about the measure, remain hard to compute or approximate. This makes it challenging to adapt many powerful techniques based on the Euclidean distance to a point cloud to the more general setting of the distance to a measure on a metric space. We propose an efficient and reliable scheme to approximate the topological structure of the family of sublevel-sets of the distance to a measure. We obtain an algorithm for approximating the persistent homology of the distance to an empirical measure that works in arbitrary metric spaces. Precise quality and complexity guarantees are given with a discussion on the behavior of our approach in practice.	approximation algorithm;euclidean distance;homology (biology);homology modeling;persistent homology;perturbation theory;point cloud;programming paradigm	Mickaël Buchet;Frédéric Chazal;Steve Oudot;Don Sheehy	2015		10.1137/1.9781611973730.13	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;geometry;persistent homology;distance	Theory	39.97180167353565	19.41427345014702	83013

In this paper, we investigate the homomorphic image order, corresponding to the existence of a surjective homomorphism between two structures. We distinguish between strong and induced forms of the order and explore how they behave in the context of different common combinatorial structures. We focus on three aspects: antichains and partial well-order, the joint preimage property and the dual amalgamation property. The two latter properties are natural analogues of the well-known joint embedding property and amalgamation property, and are investigated here for the first time.	combinatorial map;hereditary property;image and object order rendering;whole earth 'lectronic link	Sophie Huczynska;Nikola Ruskuc	2015	Order	10.1007/s11083-014-9326-8	partially ordered set;homomorphism;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;algebra	Theory	39.73964963982879	26.581367361340583	83277

83ceb430447f2889812479cf6e908e0bc29e308b	a general framework for complete positivity	reduced dynamics;complete positivity;open quantum systems	Complete positivity of quantum dynamics is often viewed as a litmus test for physicality; yet, it is well known that correlated initial states need not give rise to completely positive evolutions. This observation spurred numerous investigations over the past two decades attempting to identify necessary and sufficient conditions for complete positivity. Here, we describe a complete and consistent mathematical framework for the discussion and analysis of complete positivity for correlated initial states of open quantum systems. This formalism is built upon a few simple axioms and is sufficiently general to contain all prior methodologies going back to Pechakas (Phys Rev Lett 73:1060---1062, 1994). The key observation is that initial system-bath states with the same reduced state on the system must evolve under all admissible unitary operators to system-bath states with the same reduced state on the system, in order to ensure that the induced dynamical maps on the system are well defined. Once this consistency condition is imposed, related concepts such as the assignment map and the dynamical maps are uniquely defined. In general, the dynamical maps may not be applied to arbitrary system states, but only to those in an appropriately defined physical domain. We show that the constrained nature of the problem gives rise to not one but three inequivalent types of complete positivity. Using this framework, we elucidate the limitations of recent attempts to provide conditions for complete positivity using quantum discord and the quantum data processing inequality. In particular, we correct the claim made by two of us (Shabani and Lidar in Phys Rev Lett 102:100402---100404, 2009) that vanishing discord is necessary for complete positivity, and explain that it is valid only for a particular class of initial states. The problem remains open, and may require fresh perspectives and new mathematical tools. The formalism presented herein may be one step in that direction.		Jason M. Dominy;Alireza Shabani;Daniel A.

Since then, many concepts related to generalized closed sets were defined and investigated. In 1997, Balasubramanian and Sundaram 2 introduced the concepts of generalized closed sets in fuzzy setting. Also, they studied various generalizations fuzzy continues mappings. Recently, El-Shafei and Zakari 3–5 introduced new types of generalized closed fuzzy sets in 0, 1 -topological spaces and studied many of their properties. Also, they studied various generalizations fuzzy continues mappings. In the present paper, we introduce the concepts of Wθg-closed fuzzy sets and Wδgclosed fuzzy sets and study some of their properties. Also, we introduce the concept of FT ∗ 3/4space. Moreover, we introduce and study the concepts of two new classes of fuzzy mappings, namely, fuzzyWθg-continuous mappings and fuzzyWδg-irresolute mappings.	fuzzy set;sieve of sundaram;spaces	Mohammed E.

We prove an extension of this result to algebraic structures much more general than the field of real numbers, namely commutative semirings. In such structures, the first law (addition) is not assumed to be invertible, therefore the combinatorial proof given here significantly differs from earlier proofs for the standard case. In particular, it requires the use of the concept of bideterminant of a matrix, an extension of the classical concept of determinant.	directed graph;graph minor;kirchhoff's theorem;linear algebra;the matrix	Michel Minoux	1997	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/S0012-365X(96)00015-5	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;linear algebra;mathematics;algebra	Theory	39.520105979593566	32.19332171333724	84530

The computational complexity when simulating such systems for a bounded time-frame mainly stems from trajectories coming close to complex singularities of the system. We show that if for most initial values the trajectories do not come close to singularities the simulation can be done in polynomial time on average. For Hamiltonian systems we relate this to the volume of “almost singularities” in phase space and give some general criteria to show that a Hamiltonian system can be simulated efficiently on average. As an application we show that the planar circular-restricted three-body problem is average-case polynomial-time computable. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation → Computational complexity and cryptography	average-case complexity;best, worst and average case;computability;computable function;computational complexity theory;cryptography;dynamical system;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);in-phase and quadrature components;polynomial;simulation;theory of computation;time complexity	Akitoshi Kawamura;Holger Thies;Martin Ziegler	2018		10.4230/LIPIcs.MFCS.2018.30	combinatorics;time complexity;discrete mathematics;computer science;computability;hamiltonian mechanics	Theory	42.651377574378124	19.442187583578914	85814

We prove the uniqueness of the 4-sector of two points in the Euclidean plane. Despite the simplicity of the unique 4-sector (which consists of a line and two parabolas), our proof is quite non-trivial. We begin by establishing uniqueness in a small region of the plane, which we show may be perpetually expanded afterward.	diagram;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point theorem;knaster–tarski theorem;linear algebra;printed circuit board;reem;taxicab geometry	Robert Fraser;Meng He;Akitoshi Kawamura;Alejandro López-Ortiz;J.

Several simplified proofs contain gaps. A new proof presented here combines the ideas published later by G. Mints and M. Aiello, J. van Benthem, G. Bezhanishvili with a further simplification. The proof strategy is to embed a finite rooted Kripke structure K for S4 into a subspace of the Cantor space which in turn encodes (0, 1). This provides an open and continuous map from (0, 1) onto the topological space corresponding to K. The completeness follows as S4 is complete with respect to the class of all finite rooted Kripke structures.	cantor;kripke semantics;kripke structure (model checking);modal logic;np-completeness;symbolic computation	Grigori Mints;Shaobo Zhang	2005	Ann.

8827bad37051b6026153bb62afdbc09f23bb36b2	theories without the tree property of the second kind	nip	Abstract   We initiate a systematic study of the class of theories without the tree property of the second kind — NTP 2 . Most importantly, we show: the burden is “sub-multiplicative” in arbitrary theories (in particular, if a theory has TP 2  then there is a formula with a single variable witnessing this); NTP 2  is equivalent to the generalized Kimʼs lemma and to the boundedness of ist-weight; the dp-rank of a type in an arbitrary theory is witnessed by mutually indiscernible sequences of realizations of the type, after adding some parameters — so the dp-rank of a 1-type in any theory is always witnessed by sequences of singletons; in NTP 2  theories, simple types are co-simple, characterized by the co-independence theorem, and forking between the realizations of a simple type and arbitrary elements satisfies full symmetry; a Henselian valued field of characteristic   (  0  ,  0  )   is NTP 2  (strong, of finite burden) if and only if the residue field is NTP 2  (the residue field and the value group are strong, of finite burden respectively), so in particular any ultraproduct of  p -adics is NTP 2 ; adding a generic predicate to a geometric NTP 2  theory preserves NTP 2 .	aronszajn tree	Artem Chernikov	2014	Ann.

Since then, a large number of new results was produced. Nevertheless, the work on the subject is, even at present, a superposition of several approaches expressed in different mathematical formalisms and weakly linked to each other. The purpose of this paper is to supply a unified framework for describing quantum chaos using the quantum ergodic hierarchy. Using the factorization property of this framework, we characterize the dynamical aspects of quantum chaos by obtaining the Ehrenfest time. We also outline a generalization of the quantum mixing level of the kicked rotator in the context of the impulsive differential equations.	antivirus software;bernoulli polynomials;chaos theory;classical limit;dynamical system;ehrenfest theorem;energy level;ergodic theory;ergodicity;experiment;kicked rotator;kolmogorov complexity;lyapunov fractal;microwave;natural deduction;observable;quantum chaos;quantum mechanics;quantum superposition;relevance;requirement;semantics (computer science);semiclassical physics;stationary process;unified framework;weak value;wigner–weyl transform	Ignacio S.

This development builds upon the existing formal developments [2, 3, 4] with cardinality theorems for those structures. It provides twelve bijections from the various structures to different equivalence classes on finite functions, and hence, proves cardinality formulae for these equivalence classes on finite functions.	turing completeness	Lukas Bulwahn	2016	Archive of Formal Proofs		pure mathematics;twelvefold way;mathematics	ML	43.02560399613737	26.818366645698116	88284

The high number of graphs for a given value of the Wiener index is reduced thanks to the application of a set of heuristics taking into account the structural characteristics of the molecules. The selection of parameters as the interval of values for the Wiener index, the diversity and occurrence of atoms and bonds, the size and number of cycles, and the presence of structural patterns guide the processing of the heuristics generating molecular graphs with a considerable saving in computational cost. The modularity in the design of the algorithm allows it to be used as a pattern for the development of other algorithms based on different topological invariants, which allow for its use in areas of interest, say as involving combinatorial databases and screening in chemical databases.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;chemical database;computation;graph - visual representation;heuristics;molecular graph;structural pattern;wiener index	Gonzalo Cerruela García;Irene Luque Ruiz;Miguel Ángel Gómez-Nieto;Juan Antonio Cabrero Doncel;Antonio Guevara Plaza	2005	Journal of chemical information and modeling	10.1021/ci049788l	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;wiener index;chemistry;classical wiener space;machine learning;computational chemistry;mathematics;topological index;statistics	ML	44.37121074741795	20.128375433882436	90192

1c14affae9c9e14fc48a2560289d6d14ccf5f862	topological properties of cellular automata on trees		In the classical theory of cellular automata (CA), the unive rse is the gridZd of integer points of the Euclideand-dimensional space. The state of every cell in the grid range s in a finite nonempty set A. A configuration is an element of A d , that is, a mapf : Zd → A that describes the state of every cell. A cellular automaton is a map τ : AZd → AZd that changes a configuration by simultaneously updating the state of each cell according to a fixed local rule, i.e., a rule that only considers the states of the neighbors of this cell. In this setting, an important role is played by one-dimensio al CA (d = 1) and many results holding in this case no longer hold in the multi-dimensional case ( d ≥ 2). Another framework that has been extensively studied is that of (one-dimensional) one-side d CA (i.e., those defined on A). Provided that the universe remains discrete and homogeneou s, CA can be considered in a much more general setting, in which the grid is replaced by the Cay ley graph of a finitely generated group or semigroupG. Notice that the gridZd is the Cayley graph of the free abelian group of rank d. It is well known thatAG is a compact metric space, and there is a natural right action of G on AG, called the shift action. CA are characterized as the continuous self-mappin gs ofAG that commute with this action.	automata theory;binary tree;cellular automaton;closing (morphology);existential quantification;magma;mixing (mathematics);openness;vertex-transitive graph	Gabriele Fici;Francesca Fiorenzi	2012		10.4204/EPTCS.90.20	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algebra	ML	40.8265746263627	26.793401585446606	90470

Since the entanglement has found very important applications in quantum communication and computing [1], new ways to determine if a quantum state is entangled or not is a crucial point. Several entanglement measures have been proposed [2-5]. Among these, the quantum relative entropy is of particular interest. It is based on the distance between the state whose entanglement one wishes to measure and the set of disentangled states. In order to calculate it, it is interesting to know the general form of an n-way disentangled state. It is obvious that, if a n-partite of qubit quantum state cannot be written in the form of a general n-partite disentangled stated, then it is entangled. For example, a bipartite state AB has 2-way entanglement if	algorithmic information theory;irreducibility;kullback–leibler divergence;quantum channel;quantum entanglement;quantum information science;quantum mechanics;quantum relative entropy;quantum state;qubit;symmetric multiprocessing	Rubens Viana Ramos	2006	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;quantum information;algorithmic probability;quantum relative entropy;quantum information science;information theory;quantum complexity theory;theoretical computer science;quantum discord;mathematics;kullback–leibler divergence;computational complexity theory;quantum entanglement;coherent information;algorithmic information theory	Theory	45.40874618025926	18.743138913512887	90695

4a4e9529fa5ad28d3b72ab4f3d2f9037a41a96d2	on the k-accessibility of cores of tu-cooperative games		This paper proposes a strengthening of the author’s core-accessibility theorem for balanced TU-cooperative games. The obtained strengthening relaxes the influence of the nontransitivity of classical domination αv on the quality of the sequential improvement of dominated imputations in a game v. More specifically, we establish the k-accessibility of the core C(α v ) of any balanced TU-cooperative game v for all natural numbers k: for each dominated imputation x, there exists a converging sequence of imputations x0, x1,..., such that x0 = x, lim x r ∈ C(α v ) and xr−m is dominated by any successive imputation x r with m ∈ [1, k] and r ≥ m. For showing that the TU-property is essential to provide the k-accessibility of the core, we give an example of an NTU-cooperative game G with a ”black hole” representing a nonempty closed subset B ⊆ G(N) of dominated imputations that contains all the α G -monotonic sequential improvement trajectories originating at any point x ∈ B.	accessibility	Valeri A.

6577dfe3a0f3a4f8d39c87528e12036acd532a42	the cip system again: respecting hierarchies is always a must		The CIP system1-4 is a set of conventions through which the absolute configuration of molecules containing stereogenic units can be described compactly enough to allow its inclusion in the name of the compound. The basis of the CIP system is provided by the conventions proposed in the first publication on the subject, in 1951.1 Since then several modifications and extensions have been made to achieve greater generality.2-4 Accumulated experience and particularly the work carried out in the implementation of the CIP system for computer use demonstrated the need of further modifications and extensions.5-7 The ordering of the ligands has a fundamental role in the specification of a stereogenic unit and is the most complex step in this procedure. Although quite straightforward for simple molecules, for the more complex cases difficulties arise and the general case is extremely intricate. The application of the CIP system and particularly its computational implementation are a nontrivial task. In a recent paper published in this journal,8 a new computational implementation of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules was reported and a new subrule was proposed to rank complex ligands containing chiral centers. In the present paper, it will be demonstrated that this new subrule is unnecessary and that their need resulted from an oversimplified implementation of the CIP system.	computation	Paulina Mata	1999	Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences	10.1021/ci990090v	combinatorics;theoretical computer science;hierarchy;artificial intelligence;mathematics	Graphics	45.080866805979284	20.40895260859803	91250

f9cab104e1f3a1a71ba586005b4394d6c4f5bb33	superstability and symmetry		This paper continues the study of superstability in abstract elementary classes (AECs) satisfying the amalgamation property. In particular, we consider the definition of μ-superstability which is based on the local character characterization of superstability from first order logic. Not only is μsuperstability a potential dividing line in the classification theory for AECs, but it is also a tool in proving instances of Shelah’s Categoricity Conjecture. In this paper, we introduce a formulation, involving towers, of symmetry over limit models for μ-superstable abstract elementary classes. We use this formulation to gain insight into the problem of the uniqueness of limit models for categorical AECs.	first-order logic;line level	Monica M. VanDieren	2016	Ann. Pure Appl.

4432889f3c8d25d1a8038ab52211194fa5b6847a	property testing on product distributions: optimal testers for bounded derivative properties	property testing;lipschitz continuity;monotonicity	The primary problem in property testing is to decide whether a given function satisfies a certain property or is far from any function satisfying it. This crucially requires a notion of distance between functions. The most prevalent notion is the Hamming distance over the uniform distribution on the domain. This restriction to uniformity is rather limiting, and it is important to investigate distances induced by more general distributions.  In this article, we provide simple and optimal testers for bounded derivative properties over arbitrary product distributions. Bounded derivative properties include fundamental properties, such as monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity. Our results subsume almost all known results (upper and lower bounds) on monotonicity and Lipschitz testing over arbitrary ranges.  We prove an intimate connection between bounded derivative property testing and binary search trees (BSTs). We exhibit a tester whose query complexity is the sum of expected depths of optimal BSTs for each marginal. Furthermore, we show that this sum-of-depths is also a lower bound. A technical contribution of our work is an optimal dimension reduction theorem for all bounded derivative properties that relates the distance of a function from the property to the distance of restrictions of the function to random lines. Such a theorem has been elusive even for monotonicity, and our theorem is an exponential improvement to the previous best-known result.	circuit complexity;decision tree model;dimensionality reduction;hamming distance;marginal model;optimal control;property testing;scott continuity;time complexity	Deeparnab Chakrabarty;Kashyap Dixit;Madhav Jha;Seshadhri Comandur	2014	Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity (ECCC)	10.1145/3039241	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;monotonic function;computer science;property testing;mathematics;lipschitz continuity;reduced derivative;algorithm	Theory	41.415710577411794	18.783235755851425	92656

In addition, we explain how to construct the inscribed ellipsoidal cone Qin(K ). The circumscribed ellipsoidal cone Qcirc(K ) is then obtained by duality arguments. The canonical volume of an ellipsoidal cone is defined as the usual n-dimensional volume of a certain truncation of the cone.	cone (formal languages);convex cone;maximal set;truncation	Alberto Seeger;Mounir Torki	2016	Math.

Petri nets are used as a model for generating vector state spaces, and the state space is represented in the form of semilinear subsets of vectors. By combining the partial order methods with the proposed algorithm, we can compute reduced state spaces which preserve some important properties, such as liveness of each transition and the existence of deadlocks. The state space of a finite capacity system can be viewed as that of an infinite capacity system projected to the states satisfying the capacity condition. We also show that the proposed algorithm is applicable to vector state spaces with finite capacities.	spaces;state-space representation	Kunihiko Hiraishi	1996		10.1007/3-540-61363-3_13	partially ordered set;real representation;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;computer science;state space;state-space representation;dual representation;mathematics;sequence space;petri net;satisfiability;ordered vector space	SE	49.12989430390789	18.94778537026529	93166

We prove that it is isospectral and that it is endowed with a Poisson structure, and we discuss its invariants and Casimirs. Formulation of the Poisson problem in a Lie–Poisson setting, as a flow on a dual of a Lie algebra, requires a computation of its faithful representation. Although the existence of a faithful representation, assured by the Ado theorem and a symbolic algorithm, due to de Graaf, exists for the general computation of faithful representations of Lie algebras, the practical problem of forming a “tight” representation, convenient for subsequent analytic and numerical work, belongs to numerical algebra. We solve it for the Poisson structure corresponding to the equation X ′ = [N , X 2]. Date received: February 2, 2005. Final version received: August 23, 2005. Date accepted: August 25, 2005.

Much faster approaches for degree-of-freedom counting and rigid component calculations are known for finite structures characterized by theorems of Maxwell-Laman type, but such results are exceedingly rare and difficult to obtain. The situation is even more complex for infinite, periodic structures such as those appearing in the study of crystalline materials. Here, an adequate rigidity theoretical formulation has been proposed only recently, opening the way to a combinatorial treatment.  Abstractions of crystalline materials known as periodic body-and-bar frameworks are made of rigid bodies connected by fixed-length bars and subject to the action of a group of translations. In this paper, we give a Maxwell-Laman characterization for generic minimally rigid periodic body-and-bar frameworks in terms of their quotient graphs. As a consequence we obtain efficient polynomial time algorithms for their recognition based on matroid partition and pebble games.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;matroid;maxwell (microarchitecture);numerical analysis;pebble game;polynomial;simulation;time complexity	Ciprian Borcea;Ileana Streinu;Shin-ichi Tanigawa	2012		10.1145/2261250.2261303	matroid;rigid body;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;topology;crystal structure;mathematics;geometry;degrees of freedom;rigidity;algebra	Theory	39.373499778044525	22.737713576768677	95056

7cdf6882ac4562b680cbf679dea5d60e110ce771	sample complexity of testing the manifold hypothesis		The hypothesis that high dimensional data tends to lie in the vicinity of a low dimensional manifold is the basis of a collection of methodologies termed Manifold Learning. In this paper, we study statistical aspects of the question of fitting a manifold with a nearly optimal least squared error. Given upper bounds on the dimension, volume, and curvature, we show that Empirical Risk Minimization can produce a nearly optimal manifold using a number of random samples that is independent of the ambient dimension of the space in which data lie. We obtain an upper bound on the required number of samples that depends polynomially on the curvature, exponentially on the intrinsic dimension, and linearly on the intrinsic volume. For constant error, we prove a matching minimax lower bound on the sample complexity that shows that this dependence on intrinsic dimension, volume and curvature is unavoidable. Whether the known lower bound of O( k 2 + log 1 δ 2 ) for the sample complexity of Empirical Risk minimization on k−means applied to data in a unit ball of arbitrary dimension is tight, has been an open question since 1997 [3]. Here is the desired bound on the error and δ is a bound on the probability of failure. We improve the best currently known upper bound [14] of O( 2 2 + log 1 δ 2 ) to O ( k 2 ( min ( k, log k 2 )) + log 1 δ 2 ) . Based on these results, we devise a simple algorithm for k−means and another that uses a family of convex programs to fit a piecewise linear curve of a specified length to high dimensional data, where the sample complexity is independent of the ambient dimension.	algorithm;convex optimization;empirical risk minimization;intrinsic dimension;maxima and minima;minimax;nonlinear dimensionality reduction;piecewise linear continuation;sample complexity	Hariharan Narayanan;Sanjoy K.

The considered family of functors include as particular instances the operations considered by Magot and Zvonkin (2000), Singerman and Syddall (2003), and Girondo (2003). We identify a set of 10 operations in the above infinite family which produce vertex-transitive dessins out of regular ones. This set is complete in the following sense: if a vertex-transitive map arises from a regular dessinH applying an operation, then it can be obtained from a regular dessin on the same surface (possibly different from H) applying one of the 10 operations.

Birkhoff introduced the Aesthetic Measure, defined as the ratio between order and complexity, and, in 1965, Max Bense analyzed Birkhoff’s measure from an information theory point of view. In this paper, the concepts of order and complexity in an image (in our case, a painting) are analyzed in the light of Shannon entropy and Kolmogorov complexity. We also present a new vision of the creative process: the initial uncertainty, obtained from the Shannon entropy of the repertoire (palette), is transformed into algorithmic information content, defined by the Kolmogorov complexity of the image. From this perspective, the Birkhoff’s Aesthetic Measure is presented as the ratio between the algorithmic reduction of uncertainty (order) and the initial uncertainty (complexity).

We study stable reconstructions in terms of Riesz bases and frames, and generalize the notion of oblique dual frames to infinite-dimensional frames. As we show, the linear reconstruction scheme coincides with the so-called oblique projection, which turns into an ordinary orthogonal projection when adapting the inner product. The inner product of interest is, in general, not unique. We characterize the inner products and corresponding positive operators for which the new geometrical interpretation applies.	framing (world wide web);hilbert space;oblique projection;spaces	Yonina C.

0954a7f93d9fcb61819ba98c3d75c125640371f8	boolean simple groups and boolean simple rings		Let L be a complete Boolean algebra and G a finite simple group in the ScottSolovay D-valued model V(X) of set theory. If we observe G outside V(X), then we get a new group which is denoted by G. In general, G is not finite nor simple. Nevertheless G satisfies every property satisfied by a finite simple group with some translation. In this way, we can get a class of groups for which we can use a welldeveloped theory of the finite simple groups. We call G Boolean simple if G is simple in some V(a). In the same way we define Boolean simple rings. The main purpose of this paper is a study of structures of Boolean simple groups and Boolean simple rings. As for Boolean simple rings, K. Eda previously constructed Boolean completion of rings with a certain condition. His construction is useful for our purpose. The present work is a part of a series of systematic applications of Boolean valued method.

Our approach consists of different components at different levels of detail. Whereas one component is geometric but invariant to rotations, two other components are based on the topological structure of the molecules and thus additionally invariant to deformations. By combining these three components, which aim at the analysis of simulation ensembles of such molecules, and complementing them with a space-time representation that enables detailed interactive inspection of individual simulations, we obtain a versatile tool for the analysis of the fragmentation of structured, symmetrical molecules such as fullerenes. We exemplify the utility of our approach using a tightly coupled simulation approach for the dynamics of fullerenes.	computational topology;date and time representation by country;enumerated type;exemplification;fragmentation (computing);heuristic;homology (biology);level of detail;molecular graph;persistent homology;simulation;time complexity	Kai Sdeo;Bastian Rieck;Filip Sadlo	2018	2018 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis)	10.1109/PacificVis.2018.00022	computational chemistry;visualization;fullerene;invariant (mathematics);physics;fragmentation (computing)	Embedded	39.9164268044588	21.744557131899825	99360
30c07e37db05cbcbd0251fe7d1cf587c1bf7bc05	uncomputably noisy ergodic limits	rate of convergence;computable analysis;dynamic system;ergodic theorems;shift invariant	V’yugin [2, 3] has shown that there are a computable shift-invariant measure on 2 and a simple function f such that there is no computable bound on the rate of convergence of the ergodic averages Anf . Here it is shown that in fact one can construct an example with the property that there is no computable bound on the complexity of the limit; that is, there is no computable bound on how complex a simple function needs to be to approximate the limit to within a given ε. Let 2 denote Cantor space, the space of functions from N to the discrete space {0, 1} under the product topology. Viewing elements of this space as infinite sequences, for any finite sequence σ of 0’s and 1’s let [σ] denote the set of elements of 2 that extend σ. The collection B of Borel sets in the standard topology are generated by the set of such [σ]. For each k, let Bk denote the finite σ-algebra generated by the partition {[σ] | length(σ) = k}. If a function f from 2 to Q is measurable with respect to Bk, I will call it a simple function with complexity at most k. Let μ be any probability measure on (2,B), and let f be any element of L(μ). Say that a function k from Q to N is a bound on the complexity of f if, for every ε > 0, there is a simple function g of complexity at most k(ε) such that ‖f−g‖ < ε. If (fn) is any convergent sequence of elements of L (μ) with limit f , say that r(ε) is a bound on the rate of convergence of (fn) if for every n ≥ r(ε), ‖fn − f‖ < ε. (One can also consider rates of convergence in any of the L norms for 1 < p < ∞, or in measure. Since all the sequences considered below are uniformly bounded, this does not affect the results below.) Now suppose that μ is a computable measure on 2 in the sense of computable measure theory [1, 4]. Then if f is any computable element of L(μ), there is a computable sequence (fn) of simple functions that approaches f with a computable rate of convergence r(ε); this is essentially what it means to be a computable element of L(μ). In particular, setting k(ε) equal to the complexity of fr(ε) provides a computable bound on the complexity of f . But the converse need not hold: if r is any noncomputable real number and f is the constant function with value r, then f is not computable even though there is a trivial bound on its complexity. It is not hard to compute a sequence of simple functions (fn) that converges to a function f even in the L norm with the property that there is no computable bound on the complexity of the limit, with respect to the standard coin-flipping measure on 2. Notice that this is stronger than saying that there is no computable bound on the rate of convergence of (fn) to f ; it says that there is no way of 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 03F60, 37A25.

b1069b1daee67d99482de9d61e48925f3dc97cf6	neural ideals and stimulus space visualization		A neural code C is a collection of binary vectors of a given length n that record the co-firing patterns of a set of neurons. Our focus is on neural codes arising from place cells, neurons that respond to geographic stimulus. In this setting, the stimulus space can be visualized as subset of R 2 covered by a collection U of convex sets such that the arrangement U forms an Euler diagram for C. There are some methods to determine whether such a convex realization U exists; however, these methods do not describe how to draw a realization. In this work, we look at the problem of algorithmically drawing Euler diagrams for neural codes using two polynomial ideals: the neural ideal, a pseudo-monomial ideal; and the neural toric ideal, a binomial ideal. In particular, we study how these objects are related to the theory of piercings in information visualization, and we show how minimal generating sets of the ideals reveal whether or not a code is 0, 1, or 2-inductively pierced.	algorithm;code;convex set;diagram;euler;information visualization;monomial;neural coding;polynomial	Elizabeth Gross;Nida Kazi Obatake;Nora Youngs	2016	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics	ML	41.80219040170003	31.871274179291294	99464

Techniques involve the use of Markov chain analysis and the construction of adequate potential functions. The problem is however left open for twelve other minimal rules, which shows the need to develop this analysis further.	elementary cellular automaton;fixed point (mathematics)	Nazim Fatès	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-11520-7_62	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;asynchronous cellular automaton;mathematics;mobile automaton	Theory	40.800891542179414	20.044040228116728	100368

Moreover, we give an algorithm for constructing a linear series of curves in the plane for given basepoints.

Moreover, we show how to construct solutions in the presence of weak scatterers from the solution to the homogeneous (background problem) using Born series, providing necessary conditions for convergence and demonstrating the process through numerous examples. In addition, we outline a method for finding Green’s functions for Cayley graphs for both abelian and non-abelian groups. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the effects of sparsity on our method and results, outlining the simplifications that can be made provided that the scatterers are weak and well-separated.	magma;recurrence relation;sparse matrix	Anna C.

The matrix coefficients of such a representation give a Hopf morphism from a Hopf algebra HP generated by the intervals of P to the Hopf algebra of quasi-symmetric functions. This provides a unified construction of quasi-symmetric generating functions from different branches of algebraic combinatorics, and this construction is useful for transferring techniques and ideas between these branches. In particular we show that the (Hopf) algebra of Billera and Liu related to Eulerian posets is dual to the peak (Hopf) algebra of Stembridge related to enriched P-partitions, and connect this to the combinatorics of the Schubert calculus for isotropic flag manifolds.

b1e07bfa8705950154ed3d1377e1f9dba3588611	tarski's theorem on intuitionistic logic, for polyhedra		In 1938, Tarski proved that a formula is not intuitionistically valid if, and only if, it has a counter-model in the Heyting algebra of open sets of some topological space. In fact, Tarski showed that any Euclidean space Rn with n > 1 suffices, as does e.g. the Cantor space. In particular, intuitionistic logic cannot detect topological dimension in the Heyting algebra of all open sets of a Euclidean space. By contrast, we consider the lattice of open subpolyhedra of a given compact polyhedron P ⊆ Rn, prove that it is a locally finite Heyting subalgebra of the (non-locally-finite) algebra of all open sets of P , and show that intuitionistic logic is able to capture the topological dimension of P through the bounded-depth axiom schemata. Further, we show that intuitionistic logic is precisely the logic of formulæ valid in all Heyting algebras arising from polyhedra in this manner. Thus, our main theorem reconciles through polyhedral geometry two classical results: topological completeness in the style of Tarski, and Jaśkowski’s theorem that intuitionistic logic enjoys the finite model property. Several questions of interest remain open. E.g., what is the intermediate logic of all closed triangulable manifolds?	cantor;finite model property;intuitionistic logic;polyhedron;triangulation (topology)	Nick Bezhanishvili;Vincenzo Marra;Daniel McNeill;Andrea Pedrini	2018	Ann.

This class has been introduced and studied recently as a possible source for models of biological networks with favorable dynamic properties. We provide a geometric model for this class in the form of a toric algebraic variety described by a set of binomial polynomial equations, each of whose rational points corresponds to a nested canalyzing function. Toric varieties have a rich geometric and combinatorial structure which provides a basis for a theoretical study of the properties of canalyzing functions. In particular, a good computational characterization of this class would facilitate their incorporation into network inference methods for discrete biochemical networks.

994bb1f5ba5d5d1a6aee9059935b49d15c52d94f	incidence algebras on generalized semigroups i		In a basic paper [4], G.-C. Rota has shown that many combinatorial problems can be solved by treating the algebraic structure of the set on which one is counting. In [4] he elucidated the structure of “incidence algebras” over partially ordered sets, and on several types of lattices. Recently [3], Davis gave conditions for the multiplicative closure of the set of functions in a relation vector space (algebra). The condition was transitivity of the binary relation. In this paper we begin a study of the structure of incidence algebras over very general new algebraic structures which we call generalized semigroups. This structure includes all semigroup, some groupoids, and partial groupoids, as well as binary relations. Conditions are given for the multiplicative closure of the vector spaces of bivalued functions on the Cartesian product of a set with itself. Several conditions are given for the case when the zeta function (matrix) is of full rank. A formula is also given for the rank of the zeta function of an invertible generalized semigroup. This study is of an initial nature and it is hoped that the reader will see many areas of further exploration. Many of the results can be rephrased as a result in the theory of certain types of zero-one matrices, and in the theory of directed graphs.	cartesian closed category;directed graph;incidence matrix;incidence poset;linear algebra;mv-algebra;vertex-transitive graph	Melvin Tainiter	1971	J.

Especially, in the context of future communication methods that can be used in broadly defined computer science. The chapter presents a definition of Hamiltonian describing the dynamics of quantum data transfer in one-dimensional spin chain, which is able to transfer the state of unknown qudits. The main part of the chapter is the discussion about possibility of entangled states’ perfect transfer, in particular, for the generalized Bell states for qudits. One of the sections also contains the results of numerical experiments for the transmission of quantum entangled state in a noisy quantum channel.	computer science;experiment;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);numerical analysis;planar separator theorem;quantum channel;quantum computing;quantum entanglement;qubit	Marek Sawerwain;Joanna Wiśniewska	2013	CoRR		quantum operation;quantum information;w state;cluster state;quantum teleportation;no-communication theorem;amplitude damping channel;quantum network;quantum discord;quantum capacity;open quantum system;quantum pseudo-telepathy;qubit;quantum channel;quantum entanglement;quantum process;quantum algorithm;one-way quantum computer	Theory	51.8118551640741	24.56924823715747	104226

It is shown that the payoffs of cooperators can be enhanced to a great extent in the case of amplitude damping channel, and the payoff sudden death can be avoided in the case of bit flip and depolarizing channels. Moreover, the payoffs of cooperators tend to a constant by changing weak measurement strength in spite of sufficiently strong decoherence.	amplitude damping channel;quantum decoherence;weak measurement	Xiang-Ping Liao;Xiang-Zhuo Ding;MaoFa Fang	2015	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-015-1144-4	quantum decoherence;mathematics;mathematical economics;weak measurement;physics;quantum mechanics	Metrics	50.765417403690336	20.928686415089196	104336

In the case when q ≥ ( n 2 ) , we show that the graph Π ( n , k ) q is connected, its diameter is equal to the diameter of the Grassmann graph and the distance between any two vertices coincides with the distance between these vertices in the Grassmann graph. Also, we give some observations concerning the graphs of simplex codes. For example, binary simplex codes of dimension 3 are precisely maximal singular subspaces of a non-degenerate quadratic form.	code	Mariusz Kwiatkowski;Mark Pankov;Antonio Pasini	2018	Finite Fields and Their Applications	10.1016/j.ffa.2018.07.003	q code;linear subspace;combinatorics;vertex (geometry);mathematics;vector space;binary number;quadratic form;simplex;graph	Crypto	39.72709800752856	32.07275362974595	105023

Recently, Nowak, Olmez and Song introduced the notion of a partial geometric difference family, which generalizes both the classical difference family and the partial geometric difference set. It was shown that partial geometric difference sets and partial difference families give rise to partial geometric designs. In this paper, a number of new infinite families of partial geometric difference sets and partial geometric difference families are constructed. From these partial geometric difference sets and difference families, we generate a list of infinite families of partial geometric designs.

bfdeb89de7501efec381911354146c9b827df76b	distributed linear network operators using graph filters		We study the optimal design of graph filters (GFs) to implement arbitrary linear transformations between graph signals. GFs can be represented by matrix polynomials of the graph-shift operator (GSO). Since this operator captures the local structure of the graph, GFs naturally give rise to distributed operators. In most setups the GSO is given, so that GF design consists fundamentally in choosing the (filter) coefficients of the matrix polynomial to resemble desired linear transformations. We determine spectral conditions under which a specific linear transformation can be implemented perfectly using GFs. For the cases where perfect implementation is infeasible, we address the optimization of the filter coefficients to approximate the desired transformation. Additionally, for settings where the GSO itself can be modified, we study its optimal design too. After this, we introduce the notion of a node-variant GF, which allows the simultaneous implementation of multiple (regular) GFs in different nodes of the graph. This additional flexibility enables the design of more general operators without undermining the locality in implementation. Perfect and approximate designs are also studied for this new type of GFs. To showcase the relevance of the results in the context of distributed linear network operators, the paper closes with the application of our framework to two particular distributed problems: finite-time consensus and analog network coding.

A notion of distance to such measures has been defined and shown to be stable with respect to perturbations of the measure. This distance can easily be computed pointwise in the case of a point cloud, but its sublevel-sets, which carry the geometric information about the measure, remain hard to compute or approximate. This makes it challenging to adapt many powerful techniques based on the Euclidean distance to a point cloud to the more general setting of the distance to a measure on a metric space.#R##N##R##N#We propose an efficient and reliable scheme to approximate the topological structure of the family of sublevel-sets of the distance to a measure.

They are ubiquitous in biological, ecological, social and infrastructural systems. Here we study a transformation of these complex networks into simplicial complexes, where cliques represent the simplicies of the complex. We extend the concept of node centrality to that of simplicial centrality and study several mathematical properties of degree, clossenness, betweenness, eigenvector, Katz, and subgraph centrality for simplicial complexes. We also define the communicability function between pairs of simplices in a simplicial complex. Using a scaling between the simplicial communicability and the simplicial eigenvector centrality we develop a topological classification of simplicial complexes into four universal classes. We then study a series of simplicial complexes representing real-world complex systems. We show fundamental differences between the centralities at the different levels of the complexes—nodes, edges and triangles, which may have important implications for the dynamical processes taking places on these systems. Finally, we study the invasion rate of invasive species into a series of 14 ecological systems. Using the simplicial spectral scaling previously defined we describe quantitatively the factors determining the invasion rate of species to these ecosystems. Mainly, the existence of topological holes at the levels of nodes and triangles explain 95% of the variance in the invasion rate of these ecosystems. The paper is written in a self-contained way, such that it can be used by practitioners of network theory as a basis for further developments. simplicial complexes, complex systems, centralities, topological holes, ecological systems, invasion rate 55U10, 05C82, 05E45	betweenness;complex dynamics;complex network;complex systems;dynamical system;ecosystem;eigenvector centrality;graph (abstract data type);image scaling;network theory;simplicial complex	Ernesto Estrada;Grant Ross	2017	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;n-skeleton;topology;simplicial approximation theorem;abstract simplicial complex;mathematics;delta set;simplicial manifold;simplicial complex;simplicial homology	ECom	41.44766487677671	23.434402076198793	107090

d514637d9149218d9c8f512057c7519abf725e8b	analytic equivalence relations and bi-embeddability		Louveau and Rosendal [5] have shown that the relation of bi-embeddability for countable graphs as well as for many other natural classes of countable structures is complete under Borel reducibility for analytic equivalence relations. This is in strong contrast to the case of the isomorphism relation, which as an equivalence relation on graphs (or on any class of countable structures consisting of the models of a sentence of L_{omega_1 omega}) is far from complete (see [5, 2]). In this article we strengthen the results of [5] by showing that not only does bi-embeddability give rise to analytic equivalence relations which are complete under Borel reducibility, but in fact any analytic equivalence relation is Borel equivalent to such a relation. This result and the techniques introduced answer questions raised in [5] about the comparison between isomorphism and bi-embeddability. Finally, as in [5] our results apply not only to classes of countable structures defined by sentences of L_{omega_1 omega}, but also to discrete metric or ultrametric Polish spaces, compact metrizable topological spaces and separable Banach spaces, with various notions of embeddability appropriate for these classes, as well as to actions of Polish monoids.	turing completeness	Sy-David Friedman;Luca Motto Ros	2011	J.

In this paper the definition of XY-type Hamiltonian is presented. The Hamiltonian realizes the transfer of information in a one-dimensional spin chain, which is built of generalised units of quantum information – so-called qudits. The main presented example in the paper shows that the proposed Hamiltonian’s definition allows generating the entanglement between boundary elements of the chain. The potentiality of entanglement generation is a very important feature of future quantum communication networks. The paper also contains a numerical example for analyzing the level of entanglement with use of CCNR criterion.	classical xy model	Marek Sawerwain;Joanna Wiśniewska	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07941-7_19	quantum information;quantum mechanics;real-time computing;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);quantum entanglement;quantum information science;spin-½;computer science	Logic	52.00203988104907	24.146162823032643	107728

We introduce the notion of retractability of a definable groupoid (which is slightly stronger than Hrushovski’s notion of eliminability), give some criteria for when groupoids are retractable, and show how retractability relates to both 3-uniqueness and the splitness of finite internal covers. One application we give is a new direct method of constructing noneliminable groupoids from witnesses to the failure of 3-uniqueness. Another application is a proof that any finite internal cover of a stable theory with a centerless liaison groupoid is almost split.	direct method in the calculus of variations;theory	John Goodrick;Alexei S.

Providing new functions with such properties is a real challenge. This work shows that one can associate with any Boolean network a continuous function, whose discrete-time iterations are chaotic if and only if the iteration graph of the Boolean network is strongly connected. Then, sufficient conditions for this strong connectivity are expressed on the interaction graph of this network, leading to a constructive method of chaotic function computation. The whole approach is evaluated in the chaos-based pseudo-random number generation context.	boolean network;chaos theory;computation;digital watermarking;dynamical system;embedded system;experiment;hash function;initial condition;instability;iteration;lyapunov fractal;markov chain;markov property;pseudorandomness;random number generation;relevance;sensitivity and specificity;stochastic matrix;strongly connected component;topological entropy;vertex-transitive graph	Jacques M.

First, we deal with the local structure of L-fuzzy topology. Hence, modifying the idea of quasi-coincident neighborhood in L-topology, we concretely create an axiomatic system of neighborhood in L-fuzzy topology. Thus we find the category L-FQN of topological L-fuzzy quasi-coincident neighborhood spaces and appropriate continuous maps, which is isomorphic to the category L-FTOP, where L is fuzzy lattice. Further we prove that the category L-FQN is concretely bireflective in another category L-PrFQN constructed in the paper and L-PrFQN is topological category over SET. Secondly, to establish the relation between L-FTOP and L-TOP, we construct two categories L-AITOP and LaTQN. It is proved that L-AITOP is isomorphic to L-FTOP, in particular, when L is fuzzy lattice with locally multiplicative property, LaTQN is isomorphic to L-FTOP. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Weight vector is obtained from a desired orness of the operator. Using Faulhaber’s formulas we obtain direct and simple expressions for the weight vector without any iteration loop. With the exception of one weight, the remaining follow a straight line relation. As a result, a fast and robust algorithm is developed. The resulting weight vector is suboptimal according with the Maximum Entropy criterion, but it is very close to the optimal. Comparisons are done with other procedures.

Because of the elimination property held by lexicographic monomial orders, the corresponding Gröbner bases possess strong structural properties from which meaningful informations can be easily extracted. In the case of ideals of dimension zero, a main application is the possibility to solve polynomial systems [2], but also for the primary decomposition [3]. It is also in this case that the structure is the most understood and has attracted a lot of research, starting with [3, 2]. The most achieved result is in [6], constraint to radical ideals, and its generalization to slightly more general ideals in [7]. The present work also focuses on the structure of lexicographic Gröbner bases in dimension zero. One outcome is the similar structural property obtained in [6]. However, it has some special features as detailed below:	gröbner basis;lexicographical order;lexicography;monomial;polynomial	Xavier Dahan	2012	ACM Comm.

This so-called resolvent condition is known to imply, for all n ≥ 1, the upper bounds ‖An‖ ≤ eK(N + 1) and ‖An‖ ≤ eK(n + 1). Here ‖ · ‖ is the spectral norm, K is the constant occurring in the resolvent condition, and the order of A is equal to N + 1 ≥ 1. It is a long-standing problem whether these upper bounds can be sharpened, for all fixed K > 1, to bounds in which the right-hand members grow much slower than linearly with N + 1 and with n + 1, respectively. In this paper it is shown that such a sharpening is impossible. The following result is proved: for each > 0, there are fixed values C > 0, K > 1 and a sequence of (N + 1) × (N + 1) matrices AN , satisfying the resolvent condition, such that ‖(AN )n‖ ≥ C(N + 1)1− = C(n+ 1)1− for N = n = 1, 2, 3, . . .. The result proved in this paper is also relevant to matrices A whose -pseudospectra lie at a distance not exceeding K from the unit disk for all > 0.	density matrix;pseudospectrum;resolution (logic)	Marc Nico Spijker;S.

The theoretical foundation for most of the existing studies on CS is based on the stable embedding (i.e., a distance-preserving property) of vectors that are sparse or in a union of subspaces via random measurement matrices. To the best of our knowledge, few existing literatures of CS have clearly discussed the stable embedding of linear subspaces via compressive measurement systems. In this paper, we explore a volume-based stable embedding of multidimensional signals based on Grassmann manifold, via Gaussian random measurement matrices. The Grassmann manifold is a topological space, in which each point is a linear vector subspace, and is widely regarded as an ideal model for multidimensional signals generated from linear subspaces. In this paper, we formulate the linear subspace spanned by multidimensional signal vectors as points on the Grassmann manifold, and use the volume and the product of sines of principal angles (also known as the product of principal sines) as the generalized norm and distance measure for the space of Grassmann manifold. We prove a volume-preserving embedding property for points on the Grassmann manifold via Gaussian random measurement matrices, i.e., the volumes of all parallelotopes from a finite set in Grassmann manifold are preserved upon compression. This volume-preserving embedding property is a multidimensional generalization of the conventional stable embedding properties, which only concern the approximate preservation of lengths of vectors in certain unions of subspaces. In addition, we use the volume-preserving embedding property to explore the stable embedding effect on a generalized distance measure of Grassmann manifold induced from volume. It is proved that the generalized distance measure, i.e., the product of principal sines between different points on the Grassmann manifold, is well preserved in the compressed domain via Gaussian random measurement matrices. Numerical simulations are also provided for validation.	approximation algorithm;compressed sensing;computational fluid dynamics;manifold alignment;manifold regularization;measure-preserving dynamical system;multidimensional signal processing;numerical linear algebra;simulation;sparse matrix;statistical manifold;system of measurement	Hailong Shi;Hao Zhang;Gang Li;Xiqin Wang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2015.2417051	combinatorics;topology;sparse matrix;manifold;length measurement;mathematics;geometry	Theory	51.29093632269162	19.00649104951505	110187

We call such two approximation operators the twin approximation operators. We give some concrete examples of the twin approximation operators. Through detailed investigation on the relationship between the neighborhood and the complementary neighborhood, we further study the properties of given twin approximation operators and investigate the relationships between different twins.

The importance of this general form is that the entangled states such asBell, cat, GHZ,GHZ-like, |Ω〉, |Q5〉, 4-qubit cluster states and specific states from the nineSLOCC-nonequivalent families of 4-qubit entangled states can be expressed in this form. The proposed entanglement concentration protocol is based on the local operations and classical communications (LOCC). It is shown that the maximum success probability for ECP using quantum nondemolition technique (QND) is 2β2 for (n + 1)-qubit states of the prescribed form. It is shown that the proposed schemes can be implemented optically. Further, it is also noted that the proposed schemes can be implemented using quantum dot and microcavity systems.	bell state;cluster state;entanglement distillation;experiment;greenberger–horne–zeilinger state;ieee 1284;kerr effect;locc;maximal set;nonlinear system;quantum circuit;quantum dot;quantum entanglement;quantum nondemolition measurement;qubit;sensor	Anindita Banerjee;Chitra Shukla;Anirban Pathak	2015	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-015-1128-4	discrete mathematics;quantum circuit;mathematics;condensed matter physics;physics;quantum mechanics	ML	49.99042545955398	21.887589880295447	110900

8d7a6bdc8484375ca628859e0378385e9a3dd95b	on the energy-constrained diamond norm and its application in quantum information theory		We consider a family of energy-constrained diamond norms on the set of Hermitian- preserving linear maps (superoperators) between Banach spaces of trace class operators. We prove that any norm from this family generates strong (pointwise) convergence on the set of all quantum channels (which is more adequate for describing variations of infinite-dimensional channels than the diamond norm topology). We obtain continuity bounds for information characteristics (in particular, classical capacities) of energy-constrained infinite-dimensional quantum channels (as functions of a channel) with respect to the energy-constrained diamond norms, which imply uniform continuity of these characteristics with respect to the strong convergence topology.	information theory;quantum information science	Maksim E.

Recently it has been shown that any topos is adhesive. Many examples of interest to computer scientists are not adhesive, a fact which motivated the introduction of quasiadhesive categories. We show that several of these examples arise via a glueing construction which yields quasitoposes. We show that, surprisingly, not all such quasitoposes are quasiadhesive and characterise precisely those which are by giving a succinct necessary and sufficient condition on the lattice of subobjects.	artin billiard;computer scientist;concurrency (computer science);parallel computing;rewriting	Peter T.

The general zero discord condition is asymmetric in the way that it allows for conditional measurements in the complementary Hilbert space of two correlated systems. The problem of trying to see how the distribution of a certain observable changes in one Hilbert space based on the outcome of a measurement being made in the other Hilbert space however demands another projector to be introduced which removes the freedom of conditional measurements. In such a context one could show that the minimization of discord occurs along the projectors of the diagonal basis of the reduced density matrices.	density matrix;hilbert space;mathematical optimization;movie projector;observable;optimization problem;quantum discord;video projector	Chitradeep G.

The solution of the problem using FORMAC was notable since several other methods that were tried failed. The problem is straightforward (although untenable by hand) but nevertheless involved an elaborate use of the FORMAC language. The program was fairly large and utilized practically every command. In particular, it made extensive use of the PART command. Several tricks were necessary in order to circumvent some of the shortcomings of the FORMAC system. This paper is more concerned with the use of programming techniques in FORMAC than with the actual engineering problem, although readers may be interested in the problem because it is stated in a general (mathematical) sense and could be of interest in areas other than circuit analysis.	formac (programming language);linear circuit;network analysis (electrical circuits)	L.

The Nakajima (q, t)-characters of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules satisfy a t-deformed T -system. The T -system is a discrete dynamical system that can be interpreted as a mutation relation in a cluster algebra in two different ways, depending on the choice of direction of evolution. In this paper, we show that the Nakajima t-deformed T system of type Ar forms a quantum mutation relation in a quantization of exactly one of the cluster algebra structures attached to the T -system.	dynamical system;ibm notes;klara kedem;perl module;quantum;quiver;twisted	Bolor Turmunkh	2018	Electr.

We show that these incomplete sets cannot be extended further using the operators of the Pauli group. What is more, specific examples of sets of MUBs obtained using our construction are shown to be strongly unextendible; that is, there does not exist another vector that is unbiased with respect to the elements in the set. We conjecture the existence of such unextendible sets in higher dimensions d = 2(n > 3) as well. Furthermore, we prove an interesting connection between these unextendible sets and state-independent proofs of the Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem for two-qubit systems. Our construction also leads to a proof of the tightness of an H2 entropic uncertainty relation for any set of three MUBs constructed from Pauli classes in d = 4.	entropic uncertainty;kochen–specker theorem;maximal set;mutually unbiased bases;pauli group;qubit;uncertainty principle	Prabha Mandayam;Somshubhro Bandyopadhyay;Markus Grassl;William K.

In this paper, we study the relation between uniform convergence, stability and learnability of ranking. In contrast to supervised learning where the learnability is equivalent to uniform convergence, we show that the ranking uniform convergence is sufficient but not necessary for ranking learnability with AERM, and we further present a sufficient condition for ranking uniform convergence with respect to bipartite ranking loss. Considering the ranking uniform convergence being unnecessary for ranking learnability, we prove that the ranking average stability is a necessary and sufficient condition for ranking learnability.	algorithm;coefficient;learnability;learning to rank;loss function;realms of the haunting;shatter attack;shattered set;single-instance storage;statistical learning theory;supervised learning	Wei Gao;Zhi-Hua Zhou	2013			mathematical optimization;uniform convergence;discrete mathematics;ranking;machine learning;mathematics	AI	48.20327114737144	22.795120275019293	116447

ad39349d8350f7138553d4c8332fa8a603d1be4d	complexity of 4-manifolds	57n13;complexity;4 manifolds;4 dimensional;polyhedra	A natural notion of complexity of a PL n-dimensional manifold is the minimal number of highest-dimensional simplices in a triangulation of the manifold. Such a complexity is an integer-valued function and is finite (for each k ≥ 0 there are only finitely many manifolds whose complexity is less than or equal to k). In order to find all the n-manifolds of complexity k, one has to identify all the possible ways of gluing k copies of the n-simplex such that the link of each point is an (n−1)-sphere. Hence, producing lists of low-complexity n-manifolds can be a difficult task if n ≥ 3 because of the sphere-recognition problem. In dimension 3, S. Matveev [Matveev 90] defined an alternative notion of complexity that for “most” 3-manifolds is equivalent to the one defined above. Matveev’s complexity is based on a combinatorial description of 3manifolds by means of 2-polyhedra (their “spines”), and it turns out to be strictly related to the topological properties of the manifolds: for instance, it is additive under connected sums and is finite when restricted to irreducible manifolds. Its combinatorial nature makes it a computable invariant: using the stratification of the set of 3-manifolds induced by Matveev’s complexity it is possible to produce a list of 3-manifolds up to complexity 10 by means of computer-based computations [Martelli and Petronio 04]. Moreover, the techniques and tools [Matveev 03] that have been set up to study the topology of 3-manifolds in order to produce these lists have allowed the creation of computer programs that “recognize” 3-manifolds [Matveev 05].	complexity;computable function;computation;computer program;dimension 3;irreducibility;utility functions on indivisible goods	Francesco Costantino	2006	Experimental Mathematics	10.1080/10586458.2006.10128960	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;complexity;topology;structural complexity theory;complexity index;mathematics;geometry;polyhedron;four-dimensional space	Theory	40.48255241016236	31.949679855680515	117473

But we still lack of a kinematic meaning for the points of the ambient 7-dimensional projective space $P^7$. This paper gives one possible interpretation in terms of displacements of the Euclidean 4-space. From this point of view we also discuss the extended inverse kinematic map, motions corresponding to straight lines in $P^7$ and linear complexes of SE(3)-displacements. Moreover we present an application of this interpretation in the context of interactive motion design.	inverse kinematics	Georg Nawratil	2017	CoRR			Vision	40.16529853533467	23.99348070781771	117777

We remark that also the corresponding strongly regular graph is new, and we determine the automorphism group of the two-character set, which turns out to be the linear group L2(13). In fact, the two-character set is the union of two orbits in PG(5, 4) under the action of L2(13).		A. De Wispelaere;Hendrik Van Maldeghem	2005	Des.

By presenting an actual example, we demonstrate that the approximation capability of polygonal fuzzy numbers is efficient. Furthermore, the concepts of K-quasi-additive integrals and K-integral norms are introduced. Whenever the polygonal fuzzy numbers space satisfies separability, the density problems for several functions spaces can be studied, by means of fuzzy-valued simple functions and fuzzy-valued Bernstein polynomials. We establish that the class of the integrally-bounded fuzzy-valued functions spans a complete and separable metric space in the K-integral norms. Finally, in the sense of K-integral norms, the universal approximation of fourlayer regular polygonal fuzzy neural networks for fuzzy-valued simple functions is discussed. Furthermore, we show that this type of networks also possesses universal approximation for the class of integrally-bounded fuzzyvalued functions. This result indicates that the approximation capability which regular polygonal fuzzy neural networks for continuous fuzzy systems can be extended as for general integrable systems.	acta informatica;approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;bernstein polynomial;centrality;computer programming;comstock–needham system;diamond-like carbon;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;fuzzy number;fuzzy set;information processing;integral theory (ken wilber);layer (electronics);linear separability;liu jiren;machine learning;network address translation;neuro-fuzzy;nonlinear system;path integral formulation;pervasive informatics;scott continuity;spaces;sugeno integral;universal approximation theorem;utility functions on indivisible goods;wang tile	Guijun Wang;Xiaoping Li	2011	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-011-4364-y	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;fuzzy mathematics;fuzzy number;mathematics;fuzzy set operations	Theory	45.08713327226702	23.18912053256679	119740

Computing the concurrence experimentally under three different bipartitions, for an arbitrary three qubit pure state, reveals the entanglement class of the state. The experiment involves measuring the expectation values of Pauli operators. This was achieved by mapping the desired expectation values onto the local z magnetization of a single qubit. We tested the entanglement classification protocol on twenty seven different generic states and successfully detected their entanglement class. Full quantum state tomography was performed to construct experimental tomographs of each state and negativity was calculated from them, to validate the experimental results.	experiment;information processor;negativity (quantum mechanics);quantum entanglement;quantum information;quantum state;quantum tomography;qubit;resonance	Ashbindu Singh;Kavita Dorai	2018	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-018-2105-5	qubit;quantum electrodynamics;quantum information;quantum mechanics;pauli exclusion principle;quantum tomography;quantum entanglement;physics;negativity effect;magnetization;concurrence	ML	49.797035688752004	21.412554009940507	120049
169258342cd2a60c259bca6756b99e3913bfb471	continuous skeletons of discrete objects	computer aided design;two dimensions;numerical analysis;medial axis	The Medial Axis Transform (MAT) was defined by Blum in the sixties as an alternate description of the shape of an object Since then, its potential applicability in a wide range of engineering domains has been acknowledged. However, this potential has never quite been realized, except recently in two dimensions. One reason is the difficulty in defining algorithms for finding the MAT, especially in three dimensions. Another reason is the lack of incentive for modeling designs directly in MAT's. Given this impasse, some lateral thinking appears to be in order. Perhaps the MAT per se is not the only skeleton which can be used. Are there other, more easily derived skeletons, which share those properties of the MAT which are of interest in engineering design? In this work, we identify a set of properties of the MAT which, we argue, are of primary interest. Briefly, these properties are dimensional reduction (in the sense of having no interior), topological equivalence, and invertibility. For the restricted class of discrete objects, we define an algorithm for identifying a point set, generically called a skeleton, which shares these properties with the MAT. The algorithm will be defined for two dimensions, and a proof will be outlined. The true focus of our work, however, lies in the extension of this to three dimensions. We present ideas on how the 2D algorithm can be extended to 3D objects, and also present a line of argument which should extend the proofs of the 2D algorithm to three dimensions. *In alphabetical order ^e-mail: atul@edrc.cmu.edu. phone (412) 268-5214 1 An NSF Engineering Research Center at Carnegie Mellon University	algorithm;blum axioms;engineering design process;ibm notes;lateral thinking;medial graph;turing completeness	Atul Sudhalkar;E.

According to the shape properties, the proposed minimal surface can be classified into four categories with respect to n = 4 k - 1 , n = 4 k , n = 4 k + 1 and n = 4 k + 2 , where n is the degree of the coordinate functions in the parametric form of the minimal surface and k is a positive integer. The explicit parametric form of the corresponding conjugate minimal surface is given and the isometric deformation is also implemented.	computer-aided design;cubic function;geometric modeling;isometric projection;polynomial	Gang Xu;Yaguang Zhu;Guozhao Wang;André Galligo;Xiang Lin;Kin-Chuen Hui	2015	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2015.02.065	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;minimal surface;chen–gackstatter surface;riemann's minimal surface;scherk surface	Theory	40.137249608082264	23.53395306552302	120359

Dedication This article is dedicated to the memory of our late colleague Richard Allan Harshman. It is loosely organized around two of Harshman’s best known works — parafac [19] and lsi [13], and answers two questions that he posed. We target this article to a technometrics readership. In Section 4, we discussed a few aspects of nonnegative tensor factorization and Hofmann’s plsi, a variant of the lsi model co-proposed by Harshman [13]. In Section 5, we answered a question of Harshman on why the apparently unrelated construction of Bini, Capovani, Lotti, and Romani in [1] should be regarded as the first example of what he called ‘parafac degeneracy’ [27]. Finally in Section 6, we showed that such parafac degeneracy will not happen for nonnegative approximations of nonnegative tensors, answering another question of his. 2. Introduction The decomposition of a tensor into a minimal sum of outer products of vectors was first studied by Hitchcock [21, 22] in 1927. The topic has a long and illustrious history in algebraic computational complexity theory (cf. [7] and the nearly 600 references in its bibliography) dating back to Strassen’s celebrated result [36]. It has also recently found renewed interests, coming most notably from algebraic statistics and quantum computing. However the study of the corresponding approximation problem, i.e. the approximation of a tensor by a sum of outer products of vectors, probably first surfaced as data analytic models in psychometrics in the work of Harshman [19], who called his model parafac (for Parallel Factor Analysis), and the work of Carrol and Chang [8], who called their model candecomp (for Canonical Decomposition). The candecomp/parafac model, sometimes abbreviated as cp model, essentially asks for a solution to the following problem: given a tensor A ∈ Rd1×···×dk , find an optimal rank-r approximation to A, (1) Xr ∈ argminrank(X)≤r‖A − X‖,	approximation;bregman divergence;chemometrics;computational complexity theory;degeneracy (graph theory);factor analysis;linear algebra;naive bayes classifier;occam's razor;outer product;quantum computing;statistical model;strassen algorithm;technometrics	L.

2ac44de2b86c9e9aef1bd4fc0aab562b20684434	on a dynamical approach to some prime number sequences		We show how the cross-disciplinary transfer of techniques from dynamical systems theory to number theory can be a fruitful avenue for research. We illustrate this idea by exploring from a nonlinear and symbolic dynamics viewpoint certain patterns emerging in some residue sequences generated from the prime number sequence. We show that the sequence formed by the residues of the primes modulo k are maximally chaotic and, while lacking forbidden patterns, unexpectedly display a non-trivial spectrum of Renyi entropies which suggest that every block of size m > 1, while admissible, occurs with different probability. This non-uniform distribution of blocks for m > 1 contrasts Dirichlet’s theorem that guarantees equiprobability for m = 1. We then explore in a similar fashion the sequence of prime gap residues. We numerically find that this sequence is again chaotic (positivity of Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy), however chaos is weaker as forbidden patterns emerge for every block of size m > 1. We relate the onset of these forbidden patterns with the divisibility properties of integers, and estimate the densities of gap block residues via Hardy–Littlewood k-tuple conjecture. We use this estimation to argue that the amount of admissible blocks is non-uniformly distributed, what supports the fact that the spectrum of Renyi entropies is again non-trivial in this case. We complete our analysis by applying the chaos game to these symbolic sequences, and comparing the Iterated Function System (IFS) attractors found for the experimental sequences with appropriate null models.	chaos game;chaos theory;dynamical system;dynamical systems theory;iterated function system;kolmogorov complexity;mathematical model;modulo operation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;onset (audio);rényi entropy	Lucas Lacasa;Bartolome Luque;Ignacio Gómez;Octavio Miramontes	2018	Entropy	10.3390/e20020131	mathematical optimization;number theory;dynamical systems theory;discrete mathematics;prime number;equiprobability;mathematics;symbolic dynamics;chaos game;divisibility rule;prime gap	ML	46.84441898175194	19.960412492569358	120934

78a21368053a80036ec7ce9dd98b8449569d8cb3	forcings constructed along morasses		We further develop a previously introduced method of constructing forcing notions with the help of morasses. There are two new results: (1) If there is a simplified (ω1, 1)-morass, then there exists a ccc forcing of size ω1 that adds an ω2-Suslin tree. (2) If there is a simplified (ω1, 2)morass, then there exists a ccc forcing of size ω1 that adds a 0-dimensional Hausdorff topology τ on ω3 which has spread s(τ) = ω1. While (2) is the main result of the paper, (1) is only an improvement of a previous result, which is based on a simple observation. Both forcings preserve GCH. To show that the method can be changed to produce models where CH fails, we give an alternative construction of Koszmider’s model in which there is a chain 〈Xα | α < ω2〉 such that Xα ⊆ ω1, Xβ −Xα is finite and Xα−Xβ has size ω1 for all β < α < ω2.	andrás hajnal;hausdorff dimension;iteration;linear system	Bernhard Irrgang	2011	J.

(Nonsingular hypercubes were introduced by D. Knuth in the context of semifields. Where semifields are related to hypercubes of dimension 3, this paper considers the next case, i.e., hypercubes of dimension 4.) We define the notion of ij-rank (with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 4) and prove that a hypercube is the product of two 2×2×2 hypercubes if and only if its 12-rank is at most 2. We derive a ‘standard form’ for nonsingular 2×2×2×2 hypercubes of 12-rank less than 4 as a first step in the classification of such hypercubes up to equivalence. Our main result states that the equivalence class of a nonsingular 2×2×2×2 hypercube M of 12-rank 2 depends only on the value of an invariant δ0(M) which derives in a natural way from the Cayley hyperdeterminant det0M and another polynomial invariant det M of degree 4. As a corollary we prove that the number of equivalence classes is (q + 1)/2 or q/2 depending on whether the order q of the field is odd or even.		Kris Coolsaet	2013	Des.

26787d2414d901ae1d64113d47f3a0ff59f95c6b	regular and normal closure operators and categorical compactness for groups	closure operator	For a class of groups 55, closed under formation of subgroups and products, we call a subgroup A of a group G .T-regular provided there are two homomorphisms f, g: G -+ F, with F E ~-, so that A = {x E G I f ( z ) = g(x)}. A is called 5r-normal provided A is normal in G and G/A E 55. For an arbitrary subgroup A of G, the 55-regular (respectively, .T-normal) closure of A in G is the intersection of all .T-regular (respectively, 55-normal) subgroups of G containing A. This process gives rise to two well behaved idempotent closure operators. A group G is called 55-regular (respectively,)r-normal) compact provided for every group H, and 55-regular (respectively, 55-normal) subgroup A of G × H, 7r2(A) is an 55-regular (respectively, W-normal) subgroup of H. This generalizes the well known Kuratowski-Mr6wka theorem for topological compactness. In this paper, the 55-regular compact and 55-normal compact groups are characterized for the classes 55 consisting of: all torsion-free groups, all R-groups, and all torsion-free abelian groups. In doing so, new classes of groups having nice properties are introduced about which little is known.

8cdfc7df15872186f0e02f04bbbc1c84ef3c0481	otter proofs in tarskian geometry		We report on a project to use OTTER to find proofs of the theorems in Tarskian geometry proved in Szmielew’s part (Part I) of [9]. These theorems start with fundamental properties of betweenness, and end with the development of geometric definitions of addition and multiplication that permit the representation of models of geometry as planes over Euclidean fields, or over real-closed fields in the case of full continuity. They include the four challenge problems left unsolved by Quaife, who two decades ago found some OTTER proofs in Tarskian geometry (solving challenges issued in [15]). Quaife’s four challenge problems were: every line segment has a midpoint; every segment is the base of some isosceles triangle; the outer Pasch axiom (assuming inner Pasch as an axiom); and the first outer connectivity property of betweenness. These are to be proved without any parallel axiom and without even line-circle continuity. These are difficult theorems, the first proofs of which were the heart of Gupta’s Ph. D. thesis under Tarski. OTTER proved them all in 2012. Our success, we argue, is due to improvements in techniques of automated deduction, rather than to increases in computer speed and memory. The theory of Hilbert (1899) can be translated into Tarski’s language, interpreting lines as pairs of distinct points, and angles as ordered triples of non-collinear points. Under this interpretation, the axioms of Hilbert either occur among, or are easily deduced from, theorems in the first 11 (of 16) chapters of Szmielew. We have found Otter proofs of all of Hilbert’s axioms from Tarski’s axioms (i.e. through Satz 11.49 of Szmielew, plus Satz 12.11). Narboux and Braun have recently checked these same proofs in Coq.	automated theorem proving;betweenness;coq (software);natural deduction;scott continuity	Michael Beeson;Larry Wos	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-08587-6_38	rule of inference;otter;computer science;discrete mathematics;mathematical proof;isosceles triangle;multiplication;geometry;betweenness centrality;euclidean geometry	Theory	40.1898242613378	24.56197798474527	123040

f2240d21c99ca40d4552413f2aadf5b7664eff07	an effective topological symmetry perception and unique numbering algorithm	计算机化学与化学信息学	Determination of equivalence classes of atoms in molecules and the unique numbering for the molecular graphs are of major interest for many structure processing tasks and many programs have been reported for this purpose. Most of them were based on the use of graph invariants, but such methods reportedly failed to give correct partitioning for certain structures and the only theoretically rigorous method is based on atom-by atom matchings which was considered to be computationally impractical. In order to avoid the failures of partitioning and the time-consuming atom-by-atom matching, on the basis of a profound analysis on the mechanism of Morgan algorithm, this work proposed two improvements for the original morgan algorithm. The first improvement is to avoid the oscillatory behavior of Morgan algorithm. The second improvement referred to as single-beter Morgan algorithm, is to decompose the Morgan algorithm into single-vertex processing. By incorporating these improvements, an effective topological symmetry perception and unique numbering algorithms were devised. The high performance of these algorithms is demonstrated with some graphs that are difficult to partition.	algorithm	Zheng Ouyang;Shengang Yuan;Josef Brandt;Chongzhi Zheng	1999	Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences	10.1021/ci9800918	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;chemistry;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computational chemistry;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	44.98419913572464	20.373948105865956	124080

07eafc56c05233b596a0ef9f4aca567da00b23f5	a new proof of a theorem of shelah		In [10, §0, E), 5)] Shelah states using the proofs of 7.9 and 6.9 in [9] it is possible to prove that if a countable first-order theory T is ℵ 0 -stable (totally transcendental) and not ℵ 1 -categorical, then it has at least ∣1 + α ∣ models of power ℵ α . In this note we will give a new proof of this theorem using the work of Baldwin and Lachlan [1]. Our original proof used the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH). We are indebted to G. E. Sacks for suggesting that the notions of ℵ 0 -stability and ℵ 1 -categoricity are absolute, and that consequently our use of GCH was eliminable [8]. Routine results from model theory may be found, e.g. in [2]. Proof (with GCH). In the proof of Theorem 3 of [1] Baldwin and Lachlin show of power ℵ α such that there is a countable definable subset in . Let B 0 be such a subset. Say . We will give by transfinite induction an elementary chain of models of T of power ℵ α such that B[i 1 … i n ] has power ℵ β and such that every infinite definable subset of has power ≥ℵ β . This clearly suffices.		John W. Rosenthal	1972	J. Symb. Log.		proofs of fermat's little theorem;analytic proof	Theory	39.19889697764941	28.672672256056096	125286

To this end, we study what we call composition graphs, i.e. large graphs with a partial binary operation on which we impose only rudimentary requirements. The quasicategory thus obtained contains the quasicategory of all categories as a full reflective subquasicategory; we characterize composition graphs for which this reflexion is of a particularly simple nature. This leads to the concept of semicategory; we apply semicategories to solve characterization problems concerning absolutely initial sources, absolute monosources and potential sections. For instance, we show that in any category, the absolutely initial sources are precisely the sources that contain a section.	requirement	Lutz Schröder;Horst Herrlich	2000	Applied Categorical Structures	10.1023/A:1008651618062	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;algebra	Logic	41.08386638626069	28.31875022294977	125864

These are functions from S to S, where S is the set of states of a computer. Here S is a set of functions from M to B, where M is the memory (the set of variables) and B is a set of values; or alternatively, S is a cartesian product, over M as an index set, of the sets of values of all variables in M. For each instruction I there are defined the input region IR(I) and the output region OR(I); these are subsets of M. An instruction takes data from its input region and places data in its output region. Here OR(I) may be decomposed further into regions affected by subsets of M, which may be defined in either of two alternative ways. The theory presented here includes theorems concerning composition of instructions, decomposition of instructions, and the existence of instructions with specified regions. Many examples are given.

A brief review of descriptive Efremovic spaces as well descriptive intersection and union provides a foundation for the study of descriptive admissible covers. Descriptively near sets in admissible covers contain sequences of points with members having similar descriptions. The motivation for this approach stems from the need to consider fine-grained neighbourhoods of points in admissible covers that facilitate highly accurate measures of nearness of tiny parts of sets of objects of interest. A practical application of local admissible covers is given in terms of micropalaeontology and the detection of minute similarities and differences in microfossils, useful in the study of climate change, mineral and fossil fuel exploration.

The smallest setB of S which has this property is called the branch set . A branched coveringp : S̃ → S is regular if there exists a (finite) group A which acts pseudofreely oñ S so that the surface S is homeomorphic to the quotient space S̃/A, say byh, and the quotient map̃ S→ S̃/A is the compositionh◦p of p andh. In this case, the group A is the group of covering transformations of the branched covering p : S̃→ S. We call it abranchedA-covering. Two branched coverings p : S̃→ S andq : S̃ → S areequivalentif there exists a homeomorphism h : S̃→ S̃ such thatp = q ◦ h. Since A. Hurwitz showed how to classify the branched coverings of a given surface [ 6], this area has been studied in [ 1, 2, 5] and their references.

The firstone concerns generic types and the non-superstability of such groups in many cases. The second-one concerns the connectedness of most free products of groups without amalgamation. First-order theories of free products of groups have been recently investigated in [JS10] and [Sel10], with some transfers of arguments from free groups to free products of groups. We expect that some of this work transfers further to more general classes of groups obtained by free constructions. In this modest and short note we will make slight generalizations of early arguments of Poizat on first-order theories of free groups. By a group obtained by a free construction, we mean a free product of groups with amalgamation, or an HNN -extension. Such groups are best analized by the Bass-Serre theory of actions on trees, and we refer to [OH08] for links with Model Theory. Here our approach is purely algebraic and will adapt (and explain) some arguments contained in [Poi83]. We recall that one of the main accomplishements of [Sel10] is a proof of the stability of the free product of two stable groups. Conversely, we point out the following question as a possibly difficult one. Question 1. Can one have a free product of groups G ∗ H with a stable theory, but with the factor G unstable? We expect that the stability result in [Sel10] generalizes to certain free products with amalgamation and certain HNN -extensions, and Question 1 also makes sense in these more general cases. When considering a stable group obtained by a free construction below, we will not assume the stability of the factors.

9366ac44f7454dc0bb9d3b85cc75027f3d780706	geometric crossover for the permutation representation	permutation representation	Geometric crossovers are a class of representation-independent search operators for evolutionary algorithms that are well-defined once a notion of distance over a solution space is defined. In this paper we explore the specialisation of geometric crossovers to the permutation representation analysing the consequences of the availability of more than one notion of distance. Also, we study the relations among distances and build a rational picture in which pre-existing recombination operators for permutations fit naturally. Lastly, we illustrate the application of geometric crossover to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).	approximation algorithm;audio crossover;crossover (genetic algorithm);earthbound;edit distance;evolutionary algorithm;feasible region;graph (discrete mathematics);hamming distance;pmx (technology);paging;polynomial;sorting algorithm;time complexity;travelling salesman problem	Alberto Moraglio;Riccardo Poli	2011	Intelligenza Artificiale	10.3233/IA-2011-0004	computer science;permutation graph	Theory	41.44868016916415	21.638200122303022	128812

Such curves (called PB curves) play an important role in the derivation of rational rotation-minimizing conformal frames. The PB curve construction proposed is based upon the dual curve representation and the Euler-Rodrigues frame obtained from quaternion polynomials. The construction significantly simplifies if the curve is a polynomial one. Further, polynomial PB curves of the degree ≥ 7 and rational PB curves of the degree ≥ 6 that possess rational rotation-minimizing conformal frames are derived, and it is shown that no lower degree curves with such a property exist.	euler;polynomial	Jernej Kozak;Marjeta Krajnc;Vito Vitrih	2015	Adv.

Only later it was demonstrated that statistical convergence is closely related to convergence of the main statistical characteristics. Statistical limits are defined relaxing conditions on conventional convergence. The main idea of the statistical convergence of a sequence l is that the majority of elements from l converge and we do not care what is going on with other elements. At the same time, it is known that sequences that come from real life sources, such as measurement and computation, do not allow, in a general case, to test whether they converge or statistically converge in the strict mathematical sense. To overcome these limitations, fuzzy convergence was introduced earlier in the context of neoclassical analysis and fuzzy statistical convergence is introduced and studied in this paper. We find relations between fuzzy statistical convergence of a sequence and fuzzy statistical convergence of its subsequences (Theorem 2.1), as well as between fuzzy statistical convergence of a sequence and conventional convergence of its subsequences (Theorem 2.2). It is demonstrated what operations with fuzzy statistical limits are induced by operations on sequences (Theorem 2.3) and how fuzzy statistical limits of different sequences influence one another (Theorem 2.4). In Section 3, relations between fuzzy statistical convergence and fuzzy convergence of statistical characteristics, such as the mean (average) and standard deviation, are studied (Theorems 3.1 and 3.2).

We initiate the reverse mathematics of general topology. We show that a certain metrization theorem is equivalent to Π2 comprehension. An MF space is defined to be a topological space of the form MF(P ) with topology generated by {Np | p ∈ P}. Here P is a poset, MF(P ) is the set of maximal filters on P , and Np = {F ∈ MF(P ) | p ∈ F}. If the poset P is countable, the space MF(P ) is said to be countably based. The class of countably based MF spaces can be defined and discussed within the subsystem ACA0 of second-order arithmetic. One can prove within ACA0 that every complete separable metric space is homeomorphic to a countably based MF space which is regular. We show that the converse statement, “every countably based MF space which is regular is homeomorphic to a complete separable metric space,” is equivalent to Π2-CA0. The equivalence is proved in the weaker system Π1-CA0. This is the first example of a theorem of core mathematics which is provable in second-order arithmetic and implies Π2 comprehension.	list comprehension;maximal set;p versus np problem;provable security;reverse mathematics;turing completeness	Carl Mummert;Stephen G.

For the sake of distinguishing them, we present a class of dynamical systems, called wedge-shape systems. Through a thorough analysis of dynamical behaviors of all point-pairs, we show that wedge-shape systems can be λ-power distributionally chaotic and admit no λ′-power distributionally scrambled pairs for any λ′ ∈ [0, λ). Then we unfold a picture of distributional chaos with rich hierarchical structures, which helps to improve our comprehension of the diversity of chaos.	chaos theory	Heman Fu;Jincheng Xiong;Huoyun Wang	2015	I.

4be515193174635a152f42aa23819cee7d24cfa8	on stable torsion-free nilpotent groups	nilpotent group	"""A leading idea in the investigations of stable groups might be the conception that stable groups which are not abelian-by-finite should be similar to algebraic groups. In particular the chain conditions for stable groups should imply additional structural properties. With this in mind the following three problems arise naturally when we look at a class ~ of stable groups. 1. Is it possible to interpret an infinite field in non-(abelian-by-finite) g~-groups? 2. Provided that the first problem has an affirmative answer, is the structure of ~-groups describable with the aid of the interpreted field? 3. What can be said about the structure of ~-groups in general? These questions have already been discussed for some subclasses of the class of stable nilpotent groups. For example Baudisch [1] showed by using results of Hrushovski that there is an Rl-categorical nilpotent group of class 2 and prime exponent which is not abelian-by-finite and in which no infinite field is interpretable. Zil 'ber [14] proved that Rl-categorical torsion-free non-abelian nilpotent groups are algebraic groups. We will give an answer to question 1 and some results refering to questions 2 and 3 for the class ~ of stable torsion-free nilpotent groups. In this paper """"nilpotent"""" means """"non-abelian nilpotent"""". Concerning the first problem we shall show that in a torsion-free stable nilpotent or even locally nilpotent group an infinite field is interpretable (Theorem 2.3).

d3b4f1dac87d9612f4c0adbea1dc054a501df086	necessary and sufficient conditions for the equality of interactive and non-interactive extensions of continuous functions		Abstract In this contribution we find the class of n-dimensional joint possibility distributions with the property that the interactive extension principle coincides with the non-interactive extension principle as long as the interactive operations are determined by continuous functions strictly increasing in each argument. This result completes recent studies by the authors, where the particular case of interactive additions and multiplications versus non-interactive additions and multiplications were investigated. In addition, this time we propose results that also cover the cases when we know the fuzzy numbers only from their membership functions. It means that we eliminated the limitations that appear when we cannot pass from membership function representation to parametric representation of fuzzy numbers. As important new applications, we mention the study on the completely correlated fuzzy numbers. Also of note is that we propose two simple methods to extend bidimensional joint possibility distributions to n-dimensional joint possibility distributions. One method is based on an inductive construction while the other one is based on a pairwise construction.	interactivity	Lucian C.

9c72236a4f05470c9cc710eed707f6130aa49e56	"""finiteness spaces, graphs and """"coherence"""""""		"""We look at a sub-collection of finiteness spaces introduced in [2] based on the notion of coherence spaces from [4]. The original idea was to generalize the notion of stable functions between coherence spaces to interpret the algebraic lambda-calculus ([6]) or even the differential lambda-calculus ([3]). An important tool for this analysis is the infinite Ramsey theorem. 0. Introduction. The category of coherence spaces was the first denotational model for linear logic (see [4]): the basic objects are reflexive, non oriented graphs; and we are more specifically interested by their cliques (complete subgraph). If C is such a graph, we write C(C) for the collection of its cliques. Coherence spaces enjoy a very rich algebraic structure where the most important operations on them are: • taking the (reflexive closure of the) complement (written C ⊥ 1); • taking a cartesian product (written C 1 ⊗ C 2); • taking a disjoint union (written C 1 ⊕ C 2). If one only looks at the vertices, the corresponding operations are simply the identity, the usual cartesian product """" × """" and the disjoint union """" ⊕ """". More recently, Thomas Ehrhard introduced the notion of finiteness spaces ([2]) to give a model to the differential λ-calculus ([3]), which can be seen as an enrichment of linear logic. The point that interests us most here is that thue collection of finitary sets of a finiteness space are closed under finite sums (i.e. finite unions) to take into account a notion of """" non-deterministic sum """" of terms. (See also [6].) This is definitely not true of cliques of a coherence space..."""	clique (graph theory);gene ontology term enrichment;lambda calculus;linear algebra;linear logic;ramsey's theorem;reflexive closure	Pierre Hyvernat	2011	Logical Methods in Computer Science		condensed matter physics;discrete mathematics;dielectric;polymer;mathematics;reflectivity;oligomer;graph;solvent;coherence (physics)	Theory	42.13733416321931	28.038670228323063	130126

These auto-correlations are of different types to match signals with different types of nonlinearities. Examples are cited in all cases to make the definitions meaningful. Next correlogram diagrams are drawn separately in all cases; from these diagrams proper time lags/delays are determined. These give rise to independent coordinates of the attractors. Finally three dimensional attractors are reconstructed in each case separately with the help of these independent coordinates. Moreover for the purpose of making proper distinction between the signals, the attractors so reconstructed are quantified by a new technique called ‘ellipsoid fit’.	bivariate data;nonlinear system	Sanjay Kumar Palit;Sayan Mukherjee;D.

Such an approximation is obtained by selecting the spectral density having minimum “distance” from under the constraint corresponding to imposing the given second-order statistics. We analyze the structure of the optimal solutions as the minimized “distance” varies in the Alpha divergence family. We show that the corresponding approximation problem leads to a family of rational solutions. Secondly, such a family contains the solution which generalizes the Kullback–Leibler solution proposed by Georgiou and Lindquist in 2003. Finally, numerical simulations suggest that this family contains solutions close to the nonrational solution given by the principle of minimum discrimination information.	approximation algorithm;computer simulation;cross entropy;degree (graph theory);experiment;kullback–leibler divergence;numerical analysis;spectral density;the matrix;time complexity	Mattia Zorzi	2014	MCSS	10.1007/s00498-013-0118-2	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;mathematics	ML	44.227753935955356	19.056712483190026	132973

Two key attributes of these transforms, orthogonality and the convolution property, are inherent in such a description, suggesting the possibility of enlarging the class by extending the construction to noncommutative groups. In this context, one speaks of a noncommutative or generalized transform, the definition of which is based on the theory of semisimple rings. The author reviews the ring theory and representation theory fundamental to the existence and computation of group algebra decompositions and sketches the representation-theoretic construction of both the classical and noncommutative discrete Fourier transforms. The noncommutative transform associated with the class of dihedral groups is explicitly constructed and shown directly to exhibit both orthogonality and a noncommutative convolution property. >	theory	Robert J.

It is shown, with the aid of a Theorem of Rothmaler, that any finitely accessible class possesses purely large structures. This applies to the class Mod(R) of all left modules over a given ring R. The theory T ∗ of purely large modules is always complete. It is shown that T ∗ is model-complete if and only if R is regular. For any algebra of finite representation type R, over an infinite field, T ∗ is axiomatizable by one sentence over Th(Mod(R)). A characterization of pure semisimple rings, in terms of purely large modules, is obtained.		M. Zayed;A. Y.

We also study how some of the properties that can be demanded to an overlap function can be expressed in terms of its generator pair. In particular, given a continuous and positive t-norm T, we analyze the overlap functions which are obtained by the distortion of T by a pseudo-automorphism, showing that the additive generator pair of such overlap function may be given in terms of the considered pseudo-automorphism and the additive generator of T. Finally, we also consider the influence of the migrativity, homogeneity and idempotency properties for the overlap functions obtained by such distortion in terms of their respective additive generator pairs.	utility functions on indivisible goods	Graçaliz Pereira Dimuro;Benjamín R.

Standard methods are based on a cubical discretization of the dynamics and use the time series to construct an outer approximation of the underlying dynamical system. The resulting multivalued map can be used to compute the Conley index of isolated invariant sets of cubes. In this paper we introduce a discretization that uses instead a simplicial complex constructed from a witness-landmark relationship. The goal is to obtain a natural discretization that is more tightly connected with the invariant density of the time series itself. The time-ordering of the data also directly leads to a map on this simplicial complex that we call the witness map. We obtain conditions under which this witness map gives an outer approximation of the dynamics and thus can be used to compute the Conley index of isolated invariant sets. The method is illustrated by a simple example using data from the classical Hénon map.	approximation;conley index theory;discretization;dynamical system;hénon map;olap cube;simplicial complex;the witness;time series	Zachary Alexander;Elizabeth Bradley;James D.

The point of this presentation is not to convince readers that space-time really is discrete but rather to convince them that we do not yet know whether or not it is. Having argued that it is an open question whether or not space-time is discrete, I then turn to some possible empirical evidence, which we do not yet have. This evidence is based on some slight differences between commonly occurring differential equations and their discrete analogs.	numerical relativity;tag (game)	Peter Forrest	1995	Synthese	10.1007/BF01089732	empirical evidence;empiricism;philosophy;epistemology;calculus;space time;general relativity;continuum;mathematics;differential equation;quantum mechanics	PL	48.055241235073225	19.850075881860374	135095

In addition to the usual real-valued conservation laws we also consider more general group-valued and semigroup-valued conservation laws. The (algebraic) conservation laws in a CA form a hierarchy, based on the range of the interactions they take into account. The conservation laws with smaller interaction ranges are the homomorphic images of those with larger interaction ranges, and for each specific range there is a most general law that incorporates all those with that range. For one-dimensional CA, such a most general conservation law has—even in the semigroup-valued case—an effectively constructible finite presentation, while for higher-dimensional CA such effective construction exists only in the group-valued case. It is even undecidable whether a given two-dimensional CA conserves a given semigroup-valued energy assignment. Although the local properties of this hierarchy are tractable in the one-dimensional case, its global properties turn out to be undecidable. In particular, we prove that it is undecidable whether this hierarchy is trivial or unbounded. We point out some interconnections between the structure of this hierarchy and the dynamical properties of the CA. In particular, we show that positively expansive CA do not have non-trivial real-valued conservation laws.	algorithm;automata theory;cellular automaton;certificate authority;cobham's thesis;dynamical system;existential quantification;homomorphic encryption;interaction;linear algebra;microsoft windows;undecidable problem	Enrico Formenti;Jarkko Kari;Siamak Taati	2010	Natural Computing	10.1007/s11047-010-9222-0	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	46.59012332925523	20.397963020270183	135619

In this paper, we consider the question of how many cases of the intersection condition need to be checked, sometimes under additional hypotheses about the finite quotient group or the type of the polytope. We also apply this to the construction of a family of polytopal regular maps of every possible genus, and an infinite family of locally spherical regular 4-polytopes of type { 3 | 5 | 3 } , with all but finitely many alternating groups as automorphism groups.

Given a finite many-sorted signature Σ and a set V of visible sorts, for every Σ-algebra A with co-r.e. behavior and nontrivial, computable V-behavior, there is a finite signature extension Σ′ of Σ (without new sorts) and a finite set E of Σ′-equations such that A is isomorphic to a reduct of the final (Σ′, E)-algebra relative to V. This uses a theorem due to Bergstra and Tucker [3]. If A is computable, then A is also isomorphic to the reduct of the initial (Σ′, E)-algebra. We also prove some results on congruences of finitely generated free algebras. We show that for every finite signature Σ, there are either countably many Σ-congruences on the free Σ-algebra or else there is a continuum of such congruences. There are several necessary and sufficient conditions which separate these two cases. We introduce the notion of the Turing degree of a minimal algebra. Using the results above prove that there is a fixed one-sorted signature such that for every r.e. degree d, there is a finite set E of Σ-equations such the initial (Σ, E)-algebra has degree d. There is a two-sorted signature Σ0 and a single visible sort such that for every r.e. degree d there is a finite set E of Σ-equations such that the initial (Σ, E, V)-algebra is computable and the final (Σ, E, V)-algebra is cosemicomputable and has degree d.	turing degree	Lawrence S.

64f4aac852c35076067c96aa492e2a5dd8c7f1cd	quantum-logic synthesis of hermitian gates	hermitian gates;synthesis;quantum computation	In this article, the problem of synthesizing a general Hermitian quantum gate into a set of primary quantum gates is addressed. To this end, an extended version of the Jacobi approach for calculating the eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices in linear algebra is considered as the basis of the proposed synthesis method. The quantum circuit synthesis method derived from the Jacobi approach and its optimization challenges are described. It is shown that the proposed method results in multiple-control rotation gates around the y axis, multiple-control phase shift gates, multiple-control NOT gates, and a middle diagonal Hermitian matrix, which can be synthesized to multiple-control Pauli Z gates. Using the proposed approach, it is shown how multiple-control U gates, where U is a single-qubit Hermitian quantum gate, can be implemented using a linear number of elementary gates in terms of circuit lines with the aid of one auxiliary qubit in an arbitrary state.	jacobi method;linear algebra;logic synthesis;mathematical optimization;optic axis of a crystal;quantum circuit;quantum gate;qubit	Mona Arabzadeh;Mahboobeh Houshmand;Mehdi Sedighi;Morteza Saheb Zamani	2015	JETC	10.1145/2794263	quantum fourier transform;jacobi method for complex hermitian matrices;quantum circuit;quantum computer;quantum turing machine;quantum mechanics;quantum gate;quantum error correction	EDA	52.60713648827035	30.742850425843084	137166
5b101e00ab3be053f47ff5a4ece66c54214cae10	fuzzy hyperrings and fundamental relation		In this paper we introduce and analyze the fundamental relation on fuzzy hyperrings. This relation is the smallest equivalence relation on a given fuzzy hyperring such that it's quotient structure is a ring. Then we introduce the notion of a fuzzy complete part of a fuzzy hyperring and we study the relationship between the fundamental relation and fuzzy complete parts of a fuzzy hyperring. Also the commutative fundamental relation is introduced that its quotient structure in this case is a commutative ring. Finally some necessary and sufficient conditions so that this relation be transitive, are determined.	fuzzy set	Tahereh Nozari;Najmeh Fahimi	2016	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-152045	mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;topology;fuzzy mathematics;fuzzy subalgebra;fuzzy number;mathematics	Robotics	43.75967677927589	25.708558952413146	137228
0b8d0cb482b6dcf45ce3ab7c949a4d23dbcec722	the degree spectra of homogeneous models		Much previous study has been done on the degree spectra of prime models of a complete atomic decidable theory. Here we study the analogous questions for homogeneous models. We say a countable model A has a d-basis if the types realized in A are all computable and the Turing degree d can list ∆0-indices for all types realized in A. We say A has a d-decidable copy if there exists a model B ∼= A such that the elementary diagram of B is d-computable. Goncharov, Millar, and Peretyat’kin independently showed there exists a homogeneous A with a 0-basis but no decidable copy. We prove that any homogeneous A with a 0′-basis has a low decidable copy. This implies Csima’s analogous result for prime models. In the case where all types of the theory T are computable and A is a homogeneous model with a 0-basis, we show A has copies decidable in every nonzero degree. A degree d is 0-homogeneous bounding if any automorphically nontrivial homogenous A with a 0-basis has a d-decidable copy. We show that the nonlow2 ∆2 degrees are 0-homogeneous bounding.	bounding volume hierarchy;computable function;diagram;filter (higher-order function);turing degree	Karen Lange	2008	J. Symb.

Here we introduce a new generalization, quasi-graphic matroids, that unifies these two existing classes. Unlike frame matroids and lifted-graphic matroids, it is easy to certify that a matroid is quasi-graphic. The main result of the paper is that every 3-connected representable quasi-graphic matroid is either a lifted-graphic matroid or a frame matroid.	frame language;graphic matroid	James F.

This in particular implies that the quantum-like properties of the toy model are in fact very general categorytheoretic properties. We also show the remarkable fact that we can already interpret complementary quantum observables on the two-element set in FRel.	observable;quantum mechanics	Bob Coecke;Bill Edwards	2011	Electr.

0a078519294b577acc908ddea66c14e2f97115f1	summing a curious, slowly convergent series		diverges. Suppose we delete from the series all terms whose denominators, in base 10, contain the digit 9. Kempner [13] proved in 1914 that the remaining series converges. We also get convergent series by deleting terms whose denominators contain any digit or string of digits, such as “42”, or “314159”. However, these series converge so slowly that calculating their sums directly is out of the question. Here, we describe an algorithm to compute these and related sums to high precision. For example, the sum of the series whose denominators contain no “314159” is approximately 2302582.33386. We explain why this sum is so close to 106 log 10 by developing asymptotic estimates for sums that omit strings of length n, as n approaches infinity. At first glance, it seems counter-intuitive that merely omitting the terms 1/9, 1/19, 1/29, . . . from the harmonic series would produce a convergent series. It appears that we are removing only every tenth term from the harmonic series. If that were the case, then the sum of the remaining terms would indeed diverge. This series converges because in the long run, we in fact delete almost everything from the harmonic series. We begin by deleting 1/9, 1/19, 1/29, . . . . But when we reach 1/89, we delete 11 terms in a row: 1/89, then 1/90 through 1/99. When we reach 1/889, we delete 111 terms in a row: 1/889, then 1/890 through 1/899, and finally 1/900 through 1/999. Moreover, the vast majority of integers of, say, 100 digits contain at least one “9” somewhere within them. Therefore, when we apply our thinning process to 100-digit denominators, we will delete most terms. Only 8 × 999/(9 × 1099) ≈ 0.003% of terms with 100-digit denominators will survive our thinning process. Schumer [14] argues that the problem is that we tend to live among the set of puny integers and generally ignore the vast infinitude of larger ones. How trite and limiting our view! We can paraphrase Kempner’s argument as follows. There are 8 × 9i−1 integers with i digits that do not contain a “9”. Their reciprocals are all at most 1/10i−1, so the sum of their reciprocals is at most 8 × (9/10)i−1. Summing these numbers over i gives a convergent geometric series that converges to 80. This is an upper bound of the sum of the reciprocals of integers not containing a “9”. Kempner’s reasoning and convergence result (but not his upper bound) apply to any digit in any base. That is, if d is a digit in base B, then if we delete from the harmonic series all terms that contain the base-B digit d, we likewise get a convergent series. We can use this fact to show that deleting terms that contain any fixed string of digits also gives a convergent series. Also, there is a connection between the set of numbers that contain the decimal string “42” and the set of numbers that, in base 100, have a digit equal to 42.

In recent years, numerous topological models have been developed for boundary representation, and there have been important developments with respect to dimension and orientability. In the main, two types of topological models can be distinguished. ‘Incidence graphs’ are graphs or hypergraphs, where the nodes generally represent the cells of the modelled subdivision (vertex, edge, face, etc.), and the edges represent the adjacency and incidence relations between these cells. ‘Ordered’ models use a single type of basic element (more or less explicitly defined), on which ‘element functions’ act; the cells of the modelled subdivision are implicitly defined in this type of model. In this paper some of the most representative ordered topological models are compared using the concepts of the n-dimensional generalized map and the n-dimensional map. The main result is that ordered topological models are (roughly speaking) equivalent with respect to the class of objects which can be modelled (i.e. with respect to dimension and orientability).	boundary representation;generalized map	Pascal Lienhardt	1991	Computer-Aided Design	10.1016/0010-4485(91)90082-8	combinatorics;topology;computer aided design;mathematics;geometry;topological quantum number;representation;boundary representation;zero-dimensional space;topological entropy in physics	EDA	40.35543515546424	23.393324907521183	139233

This definition incorporates and is a natural extension of the more restricted cases of the finite Radon transform [1] where N must be prime, the discrete periodic Radon transform [2] where N must be a power of 2, and the DRT over pn [3], where N must be a power of a single prime. The DRT exactly and invertibly maps a 2-D image to a set of 1-D projections of length N. Projections are found as the sum of the pixels centred on a parallel set of discrete lines. The image is assumed to be periodic and these lines wrap around the array under modulo N arithmetic. Properties of the continuous Radon transform are preserved in the DRT; a discrete form of the Fourier slice theorem applies, as does the convolution property. A formula is given to find the projection set required to be exactly invertible for arrays with N any composite number, as well as a means to determine the level of redundancy in sampling that is introduced on such composite arrays.	modulo operation	Andrew Kingston;Imants D.

Via semi-tensor product of matrices and the matrix expression of logical functions, two kinds of the condensed algebraic expressions of singular Boolean networks are obtained. The normalization problem of singular Boolean networks is addressed; that is, under what condition singular Boolean networks can be converted into normal Boolean networks with algebraic restrictions. Then one sufficient condition and one necessary and sufficient condition are derived for the normalization problem. Furthermore, the solvability of singular Boolean networks is discussed and the concept of admissible initial values of singular Boolean networks is presented. Finally, fixed points and cycles of singular Boolean networks are also investigated.	boolean algebra;boolean network;control theory;database normalization;fixed point (mathematics);linear algebra;normalization property (abstract rewriting);semiconductor industry;the matrix	Jun-e Feng;Juan Yao;Peng Cui	2012	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-012-4666-8	boolean algebra;and-inverter graph;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;boolean model;circuit minimization for boolean functions;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;boolean network;boolean domain;boolean expression;product term;standard boolean model;maximum satisfiability problem;karp–lipton theorem;stone's representation theorem for boolean algebras;boolean algebras canonically defined;singular solution;mathematics;boolean function;complete boolean algebra;two-element boolean algebra;free boolean algebra;parity function	Theory	45.306454352643286	25.669238143668558	140747

In particular, positive Deissler rank measures the complexity of the injective envelope of a module as an extension of that module. In this paper we solve a problem of the second author by showing that certain injective envelopes have the maximum possible positive Deissler rank complexity. The proof shows that this complexity naturally reflects the internal structure of the injective extension in the form of the levels of the Matlis hierarchy. In this paper we present a general and positive solution to a problem raised in Kucera [4]. The problem concerns the structural complexity of injective modules over a commutative Noetherian ring . An injective module is essentially one wherein every formally consistent system of linear equations has a solution. The injective envelope of a module (minimal injective extension) can be constructed by adding solutions to linear systems, in a manner analogous to the construction of the algebraic closure of a field (see, for instance, Kucera [5] for details). Thus it makes sense to analyze the structural complexity of injective envelopes in terms of patterns of solutions of linear systems. There is further support for this idea from the viewpoint of mathematical logic.

We study properties of these classes determined by cardinality, measure and category as well as by the complexity of the members of a class  P . Given an effective enumeration { P   e  : e   ω } of the  Π  0  1  classes, the index set  I  for a certain property (such as having positive measure) is the set of indices  e  such that  P   e   has the property. For example, the index set of binary  Π  0  1  classes of positive measure is  Σ  0  2  complete. Various notions of boundedness (including a new notion of “almost bounded” classes) are discussed and classified. For example, the index set of the recursively bounded classes is  Σ  0  3  complete and the index set of the recursively bounded classes which have infinitely many recursive members is  Π  0  4  complete. Consideration of the Cantor-Bendixson derivative leads to index sets in the transfinite levels of the hyperarithmetic hierarchy.		Douglas A. Cenzer;Jeffrey B. Remmel	1998	Ann. Pure Appl.

M. Clementino and W. Tholen presented recently a lax-algebraic generalization of the well-known result on the coincidence of two classes of continuous maps between topological spaces: proper (maps, whose pullbacks are closed) and perfect (closed maps with compact fibres). Their achievement depends on a particular lax-algebraic extension of the concept of closed map, which relies on constructively completely distributive quantales. This paper proposes a definition of closed maps, which is not dependant on the underlying quantale of lax algebras, and proves the results of M. M. Clementino and W. Tholen in the new setting. We also show that our presented notion fits the axiomatic definition of closed maps in a category.	algebraic equation;axiomatic system;fits;linear algebra;map;whole earth 'lectronic link	Sergey A.

For that purpose we use a preliminary partition of the instance set, representing the association of a “type” to each instance. By redefining the notion of extent of a term in order to cope, to a certain degree (denoted as α), with this partition, we define a particular family of Galois lattices denoted as Alpha Galois lattices. We also discuss the related implication rules defined as inclusion of such α-extents and show that Iceberg concept lattices are Alpha Galois lattices where the partition is reduced to one single class.	definition	Véronique Ventos;Henry Soldano	2005		10.1007/978-3-540-32262-7_21	fundamental theorem of galois theory;embedding problem;galois module;combinatorics;galois group;discrete mathematics;normal basis;generic polynomial;galois cohomology;computer science;pure mathematics;splitting of prime ideals in galois extensions;mathematics;galois extension;abelian extension;resolvent;field norm	Theory	42.550846157333446	26.690088308493912	142385

In particular, it has a geometric representation featuring hyperplanes, simplicial chambers and a Tits cone. The generators of Kn are given by 2-element subsets of {0, . . . , n}. We provide some generalities to deal with groups like these. We give some easy combinatorial results on the finite residues of Kn, which are equivalent to certain simplicial real central hyperplane arrangements.		Daan Krammer	2008	Electr. J.

Soc. 52 (1946), 264 – 268) defined a famous correspondence decision problem which is nowadays called the Post Correspondence Problem, and he proved that the problem is undecidable. In this article we follow the steps of Post, and give another, simpler and more straightforward proof of the undecidability of the problem using the same source of reduction as Post original did, namely, the Post Normal Systems.	decision problem;leon;post correspondence problem;undecidable problem	Vesa Halava	2014	CoRR		computer science;artificial intelligence;post correspondence problem;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	52.14178217761278	29.89643692595714	144452
51ad43add4bb9b186d64b7bce9f607312e5e3ca0	the general uncertainty relation for real signals in communication theory	communication theory;uncertainty relation	It has often been pointed out that Heisenberg's uncertainty relation has an important analogue in communication theory. Here the complementary quantities are the duration of a pulse and the width of its spectrum. Both are defined with the aid of the variances of the squares of the absolute values of the time and spectral functions, respectively, and these functions are connected by a Fourier transform just as are the corresponding ones in quantum theory. If, as has been done in many texts, the mathematics used in quantum theory are transferred unchanged to the problem in communication theory, discrepancies arise between theory and practice for the following reasons: In the calculation of the spectral width, the variance is referred to the centroid of the square of the spectral function, and the whole spectrum, extending from ~ to +oo, is taken into account.

Under this assumption, we prove that most of the known cardinal invariants including all of those appearing in Cichon's diagram take the same value as in the corresponding Cohen model. Using this principle we could also strengthen two results of W. Just about cardinal sequences of superatomic Boolean algebras in a Cohen model. These results show that the weak Freese-Nation property of (?(ω),⊆) captures many of the features of Cohen models and hence may be considered as a principle axiomatizing a good portion of the combinatorics available in Cohen models.	chaitin's constant	Sakaé Fuchino;Stefan Geschke;Lajos Soukup	2001	Arch.

For an effectively given locally compact second countable Hausdorff space and an effectively given locally finite Borel measure on the space, we define the notion of a computable measurable set with respect to the given measure, which is stronger than Sanin's recursive measurable set. The set of computable measurable subsets is closed under complementation, finite unions and finite intersections. We then introduce interval-valued measurable functions and develop the notion of computable measurable functions using interval-valued simple functions. This leads us to the interval versions of the main results of the theory of Lebesgue integration which provide a computable framework for measure and integration theory. The Lebesgue integral of a computable integrable function with respect to an effectively given (sigma-)finite Borel measure on an effectively given (locally) compact second countable Hausdorff space can be computed up to any required accuracy. We show that, with respect to the metric induced from the L1 norm, the set of Scott continuous interval-valued functions is dense in the set of interval-valued integrable functions.	computable function;domain theory;hausdorff dimension;recursion;scott continuity;t-norm;taxicab geometry	Abbas Edalat	2007	22nd Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS 2007)	10.1109/LICS.2007.5	null set;borel set;measurable function;mathematical analysis;application software;discrete mathematics;locally integrable function;topology;measure;data type;regular measure;complex measure;computer science;borel measure;radon measure;simple function;domain theory;lebesgue integration;mathematics;hausdorff measure;outer measure;computability;programming language;sigma-algebra;computable function;computable number;logic;universally measurable set;computable analysis;set theory;σ-finite measure;discrete measure	Logic	45.51454620298323	21.983189523807795	146278

We also show that subsystems, reverse subsystems and double subsystems of a fuzzy transition system T form both closure and opening systems in the lattice of fuzzy subsets of A, where A is the set of of states of T , and we provide efficient procedures for computing related closures and openings of an arbitrary fuzzy subset of A.

Any interval of that kind is an extremally detachable closure system (that is, for each closed set A and each point x outside A, deleting x from the closure of A ∪ {x} leaves a closed set). Such closure systems have many pleasant geometric and lattice-theoretical properties; for example, they are always weakly atomic, lower locally Boolean and lower semimodular, and each member has a decomposition into completely join-irreducible elements. For intervals of κ-subsemilattices, we describe the covering relation, the coatoms, the ∨ -irreducible and the ∨ -prime elements in terms of the underlying κ-semilattices. Although such intervals may fail to be lower continuous, they are strongly coatomic if and only if every element has an irredundant (and even a least) join-decomposition. We also characterize those intervals which are Boolean, distributive (equivalently: modular), or semimodular.

1d4c2fe74cbaaba3717ed8f3a5c06ea51f6cc4f5	the branching nerve of hda and the kan condition	cubical set;satisfiability;higher dimensional automata	One can associate to any strict globular ω-category three augmented simplicial nerves called the globular nerve, the branching and the merging semi-cubical nerves. If this strict globular ω-category is freely generated by a precubical set, then the corresponding homology theories contain different informations about the geometry of the higher dimensional automaton modeled by the precubical set. Adding inverses in this ω-category to any morphism of dimension greater than 2 and with respect to any composition laws of dimension greater than 1 does not change these homology theories. In such a framework, the globular nerve always satisfies the Kan condition. On the other hand, both branching and merging nerves never satisfy it, except in some very particular and uninteresting situations. In this paper, we introduce two new nerves (the branching and merging semi-globular nerves) satisfying the Kan condition and having conjecturally the same simplicial homology as the branching and merging semi-cubical nerves respectively in such framework. The latter conjecture is related to the thin elements conjecture already introduced in our previous papers.	automaton;homology (biology);intel high definition audio;semiconductor industry;simplicial homology;theory	Philippe Gaucher	2001	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;algebra;satisfiability	Logic	41.572325352637215	29.055415231593578	149580
fa87d34aaad271c68e613fd9a1757437a2bfbecb	spherical t휀-designs for approximations on the sphere		A spherical t-design is a set of points on the sphere that are nodes of a positive equal weight quadrature rule having algebraic accuracy t for all spherical polynomials with degrees ≤ t. Spherical t-designs have many distinguished properties in approximations on the sphere and receive remarkable attention. Although the existence of a spherical t-design is known for any t ≥ 0, a spherical design is only known in a set of interval enclosures on the sphere [15] for t ≤ 100. It is unknown how to choose a set of points from the set of interval enclosures to obtain a spherical t-design. In this paper we investigate a new concept of point sets on the sphere named spherical tǫ-design (0 < ǫ < 1), which are nodes of a positive weight quadrature rule with algebraic accuracy t. The sum of the weights is equal to the area of the sphere and the mean value of the weights is equal to the weight of the quadrature rule defined by the spherical t-design. A spherical tǫ-design is a spherical t-design when ǫ = 0, and a spherical t-design is a spherical tǫ-design for any 0 < ǫ < 1. We show that any point set chosen from the set of interval enclosures [15] is a spherical tǫ-design. We then study the worst-case errors of quadrature rules using spherical tǫ-designs in a Sobolev space, and investigate a model of polynomial approximation with the l1-regularization using spherical tǫ-designs. Numerical results illustrate good performance of spherical tǫ-designs for numerical integration and function approximation on the sphere.		Yang Zhou;Xiaojun Chen	2018	Math.

d13ee81f75a324573d5740ee3446db6648adf748	a proof of the geroch-horowitz-penrose formulation of the strong cosmic censor conjecture motivated by computability theory		In this paper we present a proof of a mathematical version of the strong cosmic censor conjecture attributed to Geroch–Horowitz and Penrose but formulated explicitly by Wald. The proof is based on the existence of future-inextendible causal curves in causal pasts of events on the future Cauchy horizon in a non-globally hyperbolic space-time. By examining explicit non-globally hyperbolic space-times we find that in case of several physically relevant solutions these future-inextendible curves have in fact infinite length. This way we recognize a close relationship between asymptotically flat or anti-de Sitter, physically relevant extendible space-times and the so-called Malament–Hogarth space-times which play a central role in recent investigations in the theory of “gravitational computers”. This motivates us to exhibit a more sharp, more geometric formulation of the strong cosmic censor conjecture, namely “all physically relevant, asymptotically flat or anti-de Sitter but non-globally hyperbolic space-times are Malament–Hogarth ones”. Our observations may indicate a natural but hidden connection between the strong cosmic censorship scenario and the Church–Turing thesis revealing an unexpected conceptual depth beneath both conjectures.

As an application, we give an alternative proof of a classical duality result of Kramers and Wannier, which expresses the partition function of the 2-D Ising model at a low temperature in terms of the partition function of the 2-D Ising model at a high temperature. Moreover, we discuss analogous results for the 3-D Ising model and the Potts model.	coding theory;ising model;kramers–wannier duality;linear algebra;partition function (mathematics);potts model	Ali Al-Bashabsheh;Pascal O.

8c75b2ae71725e386d3981bf3fb64d0e3ef00b76	the wagner hierarchy		This is the second part of a series of two papers on the hierarchy of ω-rational sets introduced by Klaus Wagner in 1979 and now known as the Wagner hierarchy. Klaus Wagner actually introduced in his paper [21] two concepts defined on Muller automata: chains and superchains. Together with an operation on automata called derivation, he has proved that the maximal lengths of chains and superchains (and the ones obtained on the derived automata) are enough to characterize the classes of ω-rational sets up to the inverse image under a continuous function. This classification has also been investigated independently by W. Wadge. He has studied the reduction by a continuous function in abstract topological spaces, as a refinement of the classical Borel hierarchy. His results are based on a particular class of games, now called Wadge games. His classification itself is known as the Wadge hierarchy [8]. The connections between both theories were developed by Pierre Simonnet in his thesis [15]. The Wagner hierarchy itself has been partially rediscovered several times, in particular in [1] or in [7]. The interest in the classification of ω-rational sets was revived by the studies concerning the logic of distributed processing (see [11] for example). In the first paper [3], we have shown how one can define the objects introduced by Klaus Wagner in such a way that they become canonically attached to the sets and also become clearly syntactic invariants. In this paper, we use the objects introduced in [3] to obtain a new presentation of Wagner’s hierarchy. The result is a substantial simplification of the proofs, which is a result of the preparatory work done in the first paper.

The approach is first described, then validated on several types of classical graphs and finally used for fast filtering, showing good potential.	approximation algorithm;fast fourier transform;signal processing;sparse	Luc Le Magoarou;Rémi Gribonval	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472591	multidimensional signal processing;fourier transform;sine and cosine transforms;fast fourier transform;constant q transform;mathematical optimization;discrete-time fourier transform;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;convolution theorem;harmonic wavelet transform;pseudo-spectral method;short-time fourier transform;computer science;fractional fourier transform;discrete fourier transform;fourier inversion theorem;mathematics;discrete fourier transform;fourier analysis;matrix decomposition;non-uniform discrete fourier transform;phase correlation;prime-factor fft algorithm;fourier transform on finite groups;cyclotomic fast fourier transform	Robotics	53.71930404742613	19.267840117788143	153069

335d0141aa915aa2aef896e2b7b76e768d524f9a	macwilliams' extension theorem for infinite rings		Finite Frobenius rings have been characterized as precisely those finite rings satisfying the MacWilliams extension property, by work of Wood. In the present note we offer a generalization of this remarkable result to the realm of Artinian rings. Namely, we prove that a left Artinian ring has the left MacWilliams property if and only if it is left pseudo-injective and its finitary left socle embeds into the semisimple quotient. Providing a topological perspective on the MacWilliams property, we also show that the finitary left socle of a left Artinian ring embeds into the semisimple quotient if and only if it admits a finitarily left torsion-free character, if and only if the Pontryagin dual of the regular left module is almost monothetic. In conclusion, an Artinian ring has the MacWilliams property if and only if it is finitarily Frobenius, i.e., it is quasi-Frobenius and its finitary socle embeds into the semisimple quotient.	herman ring;matrix multiplication;torsion (gastropod)	Friedrich Martin Schneider;Jens Zumbrägel	2017	CoRR	10.1090/proc/14343		Logic	41.526749940103294	29.368686679173692	153545

In the first place, we easily identify infinite classes of vectorial plateaued functions             {  F  }   :    F    2    n    →    F    2    n          such that all non-zero linear combinations of its component functions are also plateaued. More importantly, by setting certain restrictions on the component functions, the same approach also yields many infinite classes of permutations for any   n≥6     n  ≥  6       . Finally, we deduce some infinite classes of complete permutations, as a subclass of these permutations. Most notably, all these classes are of variable and controllable degree, the property being intrinsic to the construction method. The construction method is highly tweakable giving rise to many variations that again provide us with infinite classes of these structures.

While this direction of research is promising, the computational problems that surround it are challenging and have largely been left open. To date there are only a few positive results in the literature, which show that some game-theoretic extensions of degree-, closenessand betweenness-centrality measures are computable in polynomial time, i.e., without the need to enumerate the exponential number of all possible coalitions. In this article, we show that these results can be extended to a much larger class of centrality measures that are based on a family of solution concepts known as semivalues. The family of semivalues includes, among others, the Shapley value and the Banzhaf index. To this end, we present a generic framework for defining game-theoretic network centralities and prove that all centrality measures that can be expressed in this framework are computable in polynomial time. Using our framework, we present a number of new and polynomial-time computable game-theoretic centrality measures.	algorithm;axiomatic system;betweenness centrality;characteristic function (convex analysis);computable function;computation;computational problem;enumerated type;game theory;layer (electronics);polynomial;stable marriage problem;time complexity	Piotr L.

The class of nil-Armendariz rings contains Armendariz rings and NI rings. We continue the study of nil-Armendariz rings, concentrating on the structure of rings over which coefficients of nilpotent polynomials are nilpotent. In the procedure we introduce the notion of CN-rings that is a generalization of nil-Armendariz rings. We first construct a CN-ring but not nil-Armendariz. This may be a base on which Antoine's theory can be applied and elaborated. We investigate basic ring theoretic properties of CN-rings, and observe various kinds of CN-rings including ordinary ring extensions. It is shown that a ring R is CN if and only if R is nil-Armendariz if and only if R is Armendariz if and only if R is reduced when R is a von Neumann regular ring.	coefficient;polynomial ring	Tai Keun Kwak;Yang Lee	2011	IJAC	10.1142/S0218196711006431	ring theory;quotient ring;artinian ring;local ring;discrete mathematics;topology;simple ring;unipotent;polynomial ring;localization of a ring;reduced ring;von neumann regular ring;radical of a ring;boolean ring;mathematics;geometry;primitive ring;zero ring;noncommutative ring;ring;commutative algebra;category of rings;principal ideal ring;algebra	AI	41.60162702829885	29.305118861612055	154291

The principle of information causality has been suggested to distinguish quantum theory from these nonphysical theories, together with an elegant information-theoretic proof of the quantum bound of two-particle correlations. In this work, we extend this to genuine N -particle correlations that cannot be reduced to mixtures of states in which a smaller number of particles are entangled. We first express Svetlichny’s inequality in terms of multipartite no-signaling boxes, then prove that the strongest genuine multipartite correlations lead to the maximal violation of information causality. The maximal genuine multipartite correlations under the constraint of information causality is found to be equal to the quantum mechanical bound. This result consolidates information causality as a physical principle defining the possible correlations allowed by nature, and provides intriguing insights into the limits of genuine multipartite correlations in quantum theory.	information causality;information theory;maximal set;quantum mechanics;social inequality	Yang Xiang;Wei Ren	2011	Quantum Information & Computation		pure mathematics;mathematics;physics;quantum mechanics	Theory	48.79104949932315	21.473824518308053	154590

Andre [l] and Bruck and Bose [3] have shown there is a one-one correspondence between spreads in projective space and translation planes. We use this fact to classify the spreads in the three-dimensional projective space PG(3, q). The translation planes of order 16 have been classified by Dempwolff and Reifart [9, 191. Every spread in PG(3, q) may be obtained by replacing a subset of the lines of a regular spread. The classification is divided into two parts. In the first part we classify those translation planes of order 25 containing a regulus and in the second part we classify the translation planes that do not contain a regulus. Our results show that there are 21 isomorphism classes of translation planes of order 25; 13 are planes containing a regulus and eight planes not containing a regulus. Of the 21 classes, seven were previously unknown. The results of the first part of this paper form part of a doctoral thesis (Oakden’s) [ 131 completed under the direction of F. A. Sherk in 1973.

It includes Euclidean space and hyperbolic space as submanifolds, and poses significant challenges for the design of algorithms for data analysis. In this paper, we develop foundational geometric structures and algorithms for analyzing collections of such matrices. A key technical contribution of this work is the use of horoballs, a natural generalization of halfspaces for non-positively curved Riemannian manifolds. We propose generalizations of the notion of a convex hull and a centerpoint and approximations of these structures using horoballs and based on novel decompositions of P(n). This leads to an algorithm for approximate hulls using a generalization of extents.	approximation algorithm;convex hull	P. Thomas Fletcher;John Moeller;Jeff M.

We comment on the relation between our free deterministic equivalent and deterministic equivalents considered in the engineering literature. We do not only consider the case of square matrices, but also show how rectangular matrices can be treated. Furthermore, we emphasize how operator-valued free probability techniques can be used to solve our free deterministic equivalents. As an illustration of our methods we show how the free deterministic equivalent of a random matrix model from [6] can be treated and we thus recover in a conceptual way the results from [6]. On a technical level, we generalize a result from scalar valued free probability , by showing that randomly rotated deterministic matrices of different sizes are asymptotically free from deterministic rectangular matrices, with amalgamation over a certain algebra of projections. In the Appendix, we show how estimates for differences between Cauchy transforms can be extended from a neighborhood of infinity to a region close to the real axis. This is of some relevance if one wants to compare the original random matrix problem with its free deterministic equivalent."""	apache axis;approximation;randomness;relevance	Roland Speicher;Carlos Vargas;Tobias Mai	2011	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;information theory;deterministic algorithm;random matrix;deterministic system;mathematics;free probability;statistics	Theory	43.33228729627803	21.20989706418522	154967

This relates to investigate its discrimination power (or also called uniqueness or degeneracy) that indicates how meaningful the given measure can distinguish nonisomorphic networks. In terms of biological and chemical graph analysis, a highly discriminative measure is desirable because it then has the ability to detect minor structural changes within the given network. In this article, the discriminating ability of a new super index based on Shell-matrices and polynomials is tested using (real) atomic and synthetic structures. As a result, the new descriptor can distinguish all graphs uniquely. We emphasize that some molecular descriptors which are embedded in the super index have already shown excellent correlating ability with alkanes properties. In view of the fact that most of the existing topological graph measures are degenerated, the new super index seems to be a good starting point for performing further studies in the context of network analysis. In the future, we also intent to use other sets of networks, for instance molecular graphs, to further examine the index and its meaning. In particular, we emphasize that only those indices which possess low computational complexity do have the potential to be applied for analyzing complex systems properly.	complex systems;computation;computational complexity theory;degeneracy (graph theory);embedded system;graph (discrete mathematics);linear discriminant analysis;molecular descriptor;molecular graph;polynomial;social network analysis;synthetic intelligence;topological graph;topological index	Mircea V.

Adv. Math. 3. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1982; Banaschewski and Mulvey, Houston J. Math. 6:301–312, 1980, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 33:107–122, 1984), but – somewhat surprisingly – one of the most familiar representations of the latter, the one popularized by Gillman and  Jerison’s influential book as the space of maximal z-filters, has only recently been recognized also to carry over to the pointfree setting, as is implicit in Wei (Appl. Categ.  Structures 12:197–202, 2004). The purpose of this note is to present an alternative account of this fact which places the problem into the wider context  of the saturation quotients of compact frames and what are introduced here as completely normal lattices. Specifically, we first show that the saturation quotient S(   A) of the frame    A of ideals of a completely normal lattice A is compact completely regular (Proposition 1) which is then brought to bear on the question at hand by establishing that  the cozero lattice CozL of a frame L is completely normal and finally leads to the result that S  (CozL) is the Stone–Čech compactification of L (Proposition 2). Given that familiar results concerning saturation quotients exhibit the spectrum of the latter frame as  the space of maximal z-filters of X for the cozero set lattice of a topological space X, this is then exactly the pointfree form of the desired kind. With regard to foundations, it should be emphasized that, in  notable contrast with most other work involving CozL, the present arguments are constructively valid in the sense of topos theory.

We rst prove two theorems extending Nadler’s xed point theorem. Lots of xed point theorems for fuzzy mappings have been proved, however, the method used here is completely di erent from those in the previous results. Next, we prove a theorem by applying Fan’s xed point theorem and conversely, we show that this is a generalization of this theorem. c © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The Lifting Theorem states that any such network is a quotient of a network in which all arrows are single and self-loops do not occur. Previous proofs are inductive, and give no useful estimate of the minimal size of the lift. We give a noninductive proof of the Lifting Theorem, and identify the number of cells in the smallest possible lift. We interpret this construction in terms of the type matrix of the network, which encodes its topology and labeling.	lifting scheme;loop (graph theory);semantics (computer science)	Ian Stewart	2011	I.

In [6 ], it was shown that the threshold for regular random 2-SAT is equal to unity. Als o, upper and lower bound on the threshold for regular random 3-SAT were derived . Using the first moment method, we derive an upper bound on the threshold for r egular random k-SAT for anyk≥ 3 and show that for large k the threshold is upper bounded by 2k ln(2). We also derive upper bounds on the threshold for Not-All-Eq ual (NAE) satisfiability fork ≥ 3 and show that for large k, the NAE-satisfiability threshold is upper bounded by 2 k−1 ln(2). For both satisfiability and NAE-satisfiability, the obtained upper bound matches with the corresponding bound f or the uniform model of formula generation [1,9]. For the uniform model, in a series of break through papers Ach lioptas, Moore, and Peres showed that a careful application of the second mom ent ethod yields a significantly better lower bound on threshold as compared t o any rigorously proven algorithmic bound [1,3]. The second moment method sh w the existence of a satisfying assignment with uniform positive probabili ty (w.u.p.p.). Thanks to the result of Friedgut for uniform model [10], existence of a satisfying assignment w.u.p.p. translates to existence of a satisfying assig nment with high probability (w.h.p.). Thus, the second moment method gives a low er bound on the threshold. As there is no known Friedgut type result for regu lar random model, we assume that for regular random model existence of a satisf ying assignments w.u.p.p. translates to existence of a satisfying assignmen ts w.h.p. We derive the second moment of the number of satisfying assignments for re gular randomkSAT for k ≥ 3. There are two aspects in deriving the lower bound using the second moment method. The first aspect is given any k, numerically evaluate the lower bound on the threshold. The second aspect is to derive t he lower bound as a function ofk for large enoughk. We address the first aspect and evaluate the lower bound on threshold. The numerical evaluation suggest s that ask increases the obtained lower bound on the satisfiability threshold of a regular random formula converges to the lower bound obtained for the uniform mo del. Similarly, we obtain lower bounds on the NAE-satisfiability threshold o f the regular random formulas and observe that the obtained lower bound seems to converge to the corresponding lower bound for the uniform model as k increases. ⋆ Email: vish@kth.se, eaurell@kth.se, lars.rasmussen@ee. kth.se, skoglund@ee.kth.se. 1 Regular Formulas and Motivation A clause is a disjunction (OR) of k variables. A formula is a conjunction (AND) of a finite set of clauses. Ak-SAT formula is a formula where each clause is a disjunction o f k literals. Alegalclause is one in which there are no repeated or complementary literals. Using the terminology of [6], we say that a formula is s mpleif it consists of only legal clauses. Aconfigurationformula is not necessarily legal. A satisfying (SAT) assign ment of a formula is a truth assignment of variables for which the f ormula evaluates to true. A Not-All-Equal (NAE) satisfying assignment is a truth assi gnment such that every clause is connected to at least one true literal and at least o ne false literal. We denote the number of variables by n, the number of clauses by m, and the clause density, i.e. the ratio of clauses to variables, by α = n . We denote the binary entropy function by h(·), h(x),−xln(x)− (1− x) ln(1− x), where the logarithm is the natural logarithm. The popular, uniform k-SAT model generates a formula by sele cting uniformly and independentlym-clauses from the set of all 2 k (n k ) k-clauses. In this model, the literal degree can vary. We are interested in the model where the lite ral d gree is almost constant, which was introduced in [6]. Suppose each literal has degreer. Then 2nr = km, which givesα= 2r/k. Henceα can only take values from a discrete set of possible values. To circumvent this, we allow each literal to take two pos sible values for a degree. For a givenα, let r = kα 2 andr = ⌊r⌋. Each literal has degree either r or r+1. Also a literal and its negation have the same degree. Thus, we can s pe k of the degree of a variable which is the same as the degree of its literals. Let t he number of variables with degreed bend, d∈ {r,r+1}. LetX1, . . . ,Xnr be the variables which have degree and Xnr+1, . . . ,Xn be the variables with degree r+1. Then, nr = n+rn− ⌊	2-satisfiability;binary entropy function;boolean satisfiability problem;clause (logic);conjunctive normal form;converge;email;emoticon;interpretation (logic);literal (mathematical logic);numerical analysis;peres–horodecki criterion;regular expression;universal quantification;with high probability	Vishwambhar Rathi;Erik Aurell;Lars Kildeh&#x00F8;j Rasmussen;Mikael Skoglund	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14186-7_22	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;information theory;computer science;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;algorithm	Theory	40.57442365245066	19.403095061731094	156951

The operators considered are closely related to a theorem of Korovkin (1960) [4] which states that a sequence of positive linear operators Ln on C[0, 1] is an approximation process if Ln fi → fi (n → ∞) uniformly for i = 0, 1, 2, where fi (x) = x i . We show that Ln f may diverge in a maximal way if any requirement concerning Ln in this theorem is removed. There exists for example a continuous function f such that (Ln f )n∈N is dense in (C[0, 1], ∥.∥∞), even if Ln is positive, linear and satisfies Ln P → P (n → ∞) for all polynomials P with P(0) = 0. c ⃝ 2011 Elsevier Inc.

ae3e519fe2facab7cad5065df1dc0baec8a59eef	construction of lattices of balanced equivalence relations for regular homogeneous networks using lattice generators and lattice indices	qa mathematics;equivalence relation;balanced equivalence relations;q science;coupled cell networks;lattice	Regular homogeneous networks are a class of coupled cell network, which comprises one type of cell (node) with one type of coupling (arrow), and each cell has the same number of input arrows (called the valency of the network). In coupled cell networks, robust synchrony (a flow-invariant polydiagonal) corresponds to a special kind of partition of cells, called a balanced equivalence relation. Balanced equivalence relations are determined solely by the network structure. It is well known that the set of balanced equivalence relations on a given finite network forms a complete lattice. In this paper, we consider regular homogeneous networks in which the internal dynamics of each cell is one-dimensional, and whose associated adjacency matrices have simple eigenvalues (real or complex). We construct explicit forms of lattices of balanced equivalence relations for such networks by introducing key building blocks, called lattice generators, along with integer numbers called lattice indices. The properties of lattice indices allow construction of all possible lattice structures for balanced equivalence relations of regular homogeneous networks of any number of cells with any valency. As an illustration, we show all 14 possible lattice structures of balanced equivalence relations for four-cell regular homogeneous networks.	turing completeness	Hiroko Kamei	2009	I. J.

We recognize this feature as a signature of non-separability or pseudoseparability. We systematize that kind of decomposition through an algorithm for the explicit separation of density matrices, and we apply it to illustrate the separation of some particular bipartite and tripartite states, including a multipartite $$ {\textstyle \bigotimes \nolimits ^{N}} 2$$?N2 one-parameter Werner-like state. We also work out an arbitrary bipartite $$2\times 2$$2×2 state and show that in the particular case where this state reduces to an X-type density matrix, our algorithm leads to the separability conditions on the parameters, confirmed by the Peres-Horodecki partial transposition recipe. We finally propose a measure for quantifying the degree of entanglement based on these peculiar negative (and greater than one) probabilities.	algorithm;linear separability;negative probability	M.

In this approach, we measure the minimal distance between a given structure and the structure which is obtained after applying a selected symmetry operation on it. If the given operation is a true symmetry operation for the structure, this distance is zero; otherwise it gives an indication of how different the transformed structure is from the original one. Specifically, we provide analytical solutions for measures of all the improper rotations, S n p, including mirror symmetry and inversion, as well as for all pure rotations, C n p. These measures provide information complementary to the Continuous Symmetry Measures (CSM) that evaluate the distance between a given structure and the nearest structure which belongs to a selected symmetry point-group.	arabic numeral 0;common security module;isaacs syndrome;mathematics;molecular structure;solutions;unified extensible firmware interface;contents - htmllinktype	Mark Pinsky;David Casanova;Pere Alemany;Santiago Noriega Álvarez;David Avnir;Chaim Dryzun;Ziv Kizner;Alexander Sterkin	2008	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.20772	global symmetry;inversion;chirality;octahedral symmetry;glide plane;improper rotation;reflection symmetry;closed-form expression;combinatorics;reflection;symmetry group;plane symmetry;circular symmetry;molecule;symmetry operation;rotational symmetry;rotation;symmetry;pure mathematics;mathematics;geometry;symmetry;symmetry number;physics;quantum mechanics;explicit symmetry breaking;mirror symmetry	Vision	49.32291779372631	23.45003984735483	159130

ada29856a1038665ecbe06e2c021548d1a594df7	quantum trajectories: real or surreal?		The claim of Kocsis et al. to have experimentally determined “photon trajectories” calls for a re-examination of the meaning of “quantum trajectories”. We will review the arguments that have been assumed to have established that a trajectory has no meaning in the context of quantum mechanics. We show that the conclusion that the Bohm trajectories should be called “surreal” because they are at “variance with the actual observed track” of a particle is wrong as it is based on a false argument. We also present the results of a numerical investigation of a double Stern-Gerlach experiment which shows clearly the role of the spin within the Bohm formalism and discuss situations where the appearance of the quantum potential is open to direct experimental exploration.	aharonov–bohm effect;de broglie–bohm theory;numerical analysis;quantum mechanics;quantum potential;quantum stochastic calculus;semantics (computer science);stern–gerlach experiment	Basil J.

7b4bcf4e5f7db92a4215fa250265241e953882c1	on computability and triviality of well groups	004;nonlinear equations robustness well groups computation homotopy theory	The concept of well group in a special but important case captures homological properties of the zero set of a continuous map f : K → R on a compact space K that are invariant with respect to perturbations of f . The perturbations are arbitrary continuous maps within L∞ distance r from f for a given r > 0. The main drawback of the approach is that the computability of well groups was shown only when dimK = n or n = 1. Our contribution to the theory of well groups is twofold: on the one hand we improve on the computability issue, but on the other hand we present a range of examples where the well groups are incomplete invariants, that is, fail to capture certain important robust properties of the zero set. For the first part, we identify a computable subgroup of the well group that is obtained by cap product with the pullback of the orientation of R by f . In other words, well groups can be algorithmically approximated from below. When f is smooth and dimK < 2n − 2, our approximation of the (dim K − n)th well group is exact. For the second part, we find examples of maps f, f ′ : K → R with all well groups isomorphic but whose perturbations have different zero sets. We discuss on a possible replacement of the well groups of vector valued maps by an invariant of a better descriptive power and computability status. 1998 ACM Subject Classification G.1.5 Roots of Nonlinear Equations, F.2.2 Nonnumerical Algorithms and Problems	approximation algorithm;computability;computable function;map;roots;whole earth 'lectronic link	Peter Franek;Marek Krcál	2015		10.4230/LIPIcs.SOCG.2015.842	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;geometry;algorithm	Theory	42.51717396739242	28.45153080439655	159345

We find necessary and sufficient conditions for (e′, M*) to be another factorization system, and show that a number of interesting factorization systems arise in this way. We further make the connexion with Galois theory, where M*is the class of coverings; and include self-contained modern accounts of factorization systems, descent theory, and Galois theory.		A.

In the case of the rotation group, these subgroups are the chiral point groups, and in the case of the special Euclidean group, the discrete subgroups are the chiral crystallographic space groups. Taking the quotients of either of these two Lie groups by any of their respective co-compact discrete subgroups results in coset spaces that are compact orientable manifolds. In this paper we develop methods for sampling on these manifolds by partitioning them further using double-coset decompositions. Fundamental domains associated with the aforementioned coset- and double-coset decompositions can be defined as Voronoi cells in the original groups. Division of these groups into Voronoi cells facilitates almost-uniform sampling. We explicitly compute these cells and illustrate their use in optimization, integration, and Fourier analysis on these groups. Motivating applications from the fields of protein crystallography, robotics, and control are reviewed in the context of this theory.	cartesian closed category;chirality (chemistry);coset leader;fourier analysis;mathematical optimization;regular grid;robotics;sampling (signal processing);time complexity;voronoi diagram	Yan Yan;Gregory S.

76440c1f06e714b3df3f2a811005f430fd86429c	embedding locales and formal topologies into positive topologies		A positive topology is a set equipped with two particular relations between elements and subsets of that set: a convergent cover relation and a positivity relation. A set equipped with a convergent cover relation is a predicative counterpart of a locale, where the given set plays the role of a set of generators, typically a base, and the cover encodes the relations between generators. A positivity relation enriches the structure of a locale; among other things, it is a tool to study some particular subobjects, namely the overt weakly closed sublocales. We relate the category of locales to that of positive topologies and we show that the former is a reflective subcategory of the latter. We then generalize such a result to the (opposite of the) category of suplattices, which we present by means of (not necessarily convergent) cover relations. Finally, we show that the category of positive topologies also generalizes that of formal topologies, that is, overt locales.	emitter-coupled logic;impredicativity	Francesco Ciraulo;Giovanni Sambin	2018	Arch.

In this paper, we adapt the Laplacian pyramid transform for signals on Euclidean domains so that it can be used to analyze high-dimensional data residing on the vertices of a weighted graph. Our approach is to study existing methods and develop new methods for the four fundamental operations of graph downsampling, graph reduction, and filtering and interpolation of signals on graphs. Equipped with appropriate notions of these operations, we leverage the basic multiscale constructs and intuitions from classical signal processing to generate a transform that yields both a multiresolution of graphs and an associated multiresolution of a graph signal on the underlying sequence of graphs.	algorithmic efficiency;analog signal;data domain;decimation (signal processing);filter bank;graph (discrete mathematics);graph reduction;interpolation;iteration;lambda lifting;laplacian matrix;machine learning;signal processing;sparse matrix;transitive reduction	David I.

Trimness is a not-necessarily-graded generalization of distributivity; in particular, if a lattice is trim and graded, it is distributive. Trimness is preserved under taking intervals and suitable sublattices. Trim lattices satisfy a weakened form of modularity. The order complex of a trim lattice is contractible or homotopic to a sphere; the latter holds exactly if the maximum element of the lattice is a join of atoms. Other than distributive lattices, the main examples of trim lattices are the Tamari lattices and various generalizations of them. We show that the Cambrian lattices in types A and B defined by Reading are trim, and we conjecture that all Cambrian lattices are trim.	join (sql);residuated lattice	Hugh Thomas	2006	Order	10.1007/s11083-006-9046-9	distributive lattice;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;integer lattice;congruence lattice problem;pure mathematics;mathematics;complemented lattice;map of lattices;lattice field theory;satisfiability	Theory	41.0694877362713	28.196203351787055	161611

On the other hand for polynomials in general, ∥∥p′∥∥ can be arbitrarily small as compared to ‖p‖. The situation changes when we assume that the polynomials in question have all their zeroes in the convex set K. This was first investigated by Turán, who showed the lower bounds ∥∥p′∥∥ (n/2) ‖p‖ for the unit disk D and ∥∥p′∥∥ c√n ‖p‖ for the unit interval I := [−1, 1]. Although partial results provided general lower estimates of order √ n, as well as certain classes of domains with lower bounds of order n, it was not clear what order of magnitude the general convex domains may admit here. Here we show that for all bounded and convex domains K with nonempty interior and polynomials p with all their zeroes lying in K ∥∥p′∥∥ c(K)n ‖p‖ holds true, while ∥∥p′∥∥ C(K)n ‖p‖ occurs for any K. Actually, we determine c(K) and C(K) within a factor of absolute numerical constant. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

addab9930bb69ded28b5825a53fa8064d48f8ef8	non-equilibrium pattern selection in particle sedimentation	sedimentation;thermal gradient;fluid solid interaction;entropy production;pattern selection;thermodynamics	In this paper, we explain some well known experimental observations in fluid solid interaction from a thermodynamic perspective. In particular we use the extremum of the rate of entropy production to establish the stability of specific patterns observed in single and multiparticle sedimentation in an infinite fluid and the sedimentation of spheres in the presence of walls. While these phenomena have been explained numerically, there is no known rigorous theoretical argument to establish the stability of the observed configurations. We provide a very convincing theoretical basis using entropy based arguments that are considered by several scientists as the underlying theme of nature, life and evolution. In the absence of many rigorous examples for the entropy production principle, our paper advances this argument and lends it much credibility. In addition to looking at the rate of entropy production, we also put forth a very plausible heuristic argument based on the thermal gradients in the systems being studied, which could be the underlying causal principle for many known patterns in nature. 2011 Elsevier Inc.

47e549eac5db446e98f510200aebde29cb1e7b8f	iteration problem for distributional chaos		We disprove the conjecture that distributional chaos of type 3 (briefly, DC3) is iteration invariant and show that a slightly strengthened definition, denoted by DC2$\frac{1}{2}$, is preserved under iteration, i.e. $f^n$ is DC2$\frac{1}{2}$ if and only if $f$ is too. Unlike DC3, DC2$\frac{1}{2}$ is also conjugacy invariant and implies Li-Yorke chaos. The definition of DC2$\frac{1}{2}$ is the following: a pair $(x,y)$ is DC2$\frac{1}{2}$ iff $\Phi_{(x,y)}(0)<\Phi^*_{(x,y)}(0)$, where $\Phi_{(x,y)}(\delta)$ (resp. $\Phi^*_{(x,y)}(\delta)$) is lower (resp. upper) density of times $k$ when $d(f^k(x),f^k(y))<\delta$ and both densities are defined at 0 as limits of their values for $\delta\to 0^+$. Hence DC$2\frac{1}{2}$ shares similar properties with DC1 and DC2 but unlike them, strict DC$2\frac{1}{2}$ systems must have zero topological entropy.	iteration	Jana Hantáková	2017	I. J.

87c2f4bb93ba08d8d09f6bead542af3a42c6f7cc	automated geometric reasoning with geometric algebra: theory and practice		The field of Automated Theorem Proving was initiated by A. Newell et al. with the emergence of Artificial Intelligence. Significant advances in the logic deduction approach were made between 1950-60, e.g., in the work of H. Gelernter et al. Still, these advances are inefficient in proving relatively nontrivial theorems, such as those in classical geometry, where auxiliary lines are often necessary in the proofs. In the analytic approach, geometric theorems can be described by algebraic languages, leading to algebraic methods for automated theorem proving in geometry. Between 1970-80, W.-T. Wu proposed the Ritt-Wu characteristic set method for automated theorem proving, which was a breakthrough in Automated Reasoning at the time. Afterwards, several other algebraic methods for automated theorem proving were proposed, e.g., Gröbner basis method, area method, vector algebra method, Geometric Algebra method, to name a few. The scope of automatically provable geometric theorems also extends from classical Euclidean geometry and differential geometry to Riemannian geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, geometric inequalities, combinatorial identities, etc. From the viewpoint of knowledge management and query, the logic approach represents a geometric theorem as a logic implication of the conclusion by the hypotheses, both of which are relations among geometric objects. In this approach, applying the geometric theorem to a given geometric configuration is by first searching the database of geometric relations in the geometric configuration to match the hypotheses, then adding the conclusion to the database after exact match is fulfilled.	artificial intelligence;automated reasoning;automated theorem proving;emergence;gröbner basis;knowledge management;linear algebra;natural deduction;provable security	Hongbo Li	2017		10.1145/3087604.3087663	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;geometric algebra;algebraic graph theory;cellular algebra;universal geometric algebra;multivector;filtered algebra;grassmann–cayley algebra;conformal geometric algebra;mathematics	AI	40.947503899077816	24.704149181762883	165315

The spectral moments are expressed as linear combinations of the different structural fragments of the molecular graph. The use of the substructural approach for the description of seven physical properties of alkanes is also proved.

To reveal the dynamic behavior of a system modeled by a Petri net, generating elementary T-invariants is indispensable. For a given Petri net, there may be an enormous number of elementary T-invariants and so generally generating all the elementary T-invariants would take too much computation time and storage. In this paper, we discuss how to apply linear programming techniques to compute elementary T-invariants. As a result, we propose a new efficient method of computing all the elementary T-invariants of a given Petri net with less storage.	class invariant;computation;graph property;linear programming;petri net;time complexity	Tomiyuki Fukunaga;Qi-Wei Ge;Mitsuru Nakata	2005	2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1464551	discrete mathematics;stochastic petri net;computer science;linear programming;theoretical computer science;mathematics;process architecture;petri net;algorithm	EDA	45.836430572097704	20.867052779169644	165736

This paper demonstrates the correctness of and analyzes the complexity of several fundamental operations on linear quadtrees. In particular, an algorithm for computing the intersection, union, and pairwise difference of two linear quadtrees is presented and analyzed. These operations provide the basis for many more complex image processing techniques and, hence, their efficiency and correctness are extremely important. It is shown that these algorithms are linear in the number of nodes in the linear quadtrees involved in the operations. The paper also provides a brief introduction to linear quadtrees and some of their properties. 8 1985 Academic	algorithm;correctness (computer science);image processing;quadtree	Michael Anthony Bauer	1985	Computer Vision, Graphics, and Image Processing	10.1016/0734-189X(85)90120-3	computer vision;discrete mathematics;data structure;image processing;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm	DB	40.810174048172506	22.21470879265278	166747

(multi-scale modeling and analysis of ambiguous macro-molecular assemblies, with applications to the nuclear pore complex)		Structural genomics projects have revealed remarkable features of proteomes. But these are essentially of combinatorial nature—selected proteins interact within a complex, so that extending them to the structural level requires building 3D models of these complexes. Such models have recently been reconstructed for the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC), based on the integration of diverse biophysical and biochemical data. Yet, a full synergy between them and the experimental data is not at play because the reconstructions are qualitative. This thesis makes three contributions addressing these limitations. First, we introduce toleranced models (TOM) to inherently represent uncertain shapes as a continuum of models. We show that a TOM is equivalent to a compoundly weighted Voronoi diagram, and develop the λ -complex, the equivalent of the α-complex for such a diagram. Second, we use toleranced models to represent protein assemblies. We explain how a toleranced model can be used to assess stable contacts between proteins and to check the coherence between such a model and experimental data. Third, we propose tools to compare graphs encoding contacts within proteins, such graphs coming from a toleranced model on the one hand, and from atomic-resolution models on the other hand. All these concepts and tools are used to probe the aforementioned reconstructions of the NPC.	3d modeling;np-completeness;synergy;tom;triune continuum paradigm;weighted voronoi diagram	Tom Dreyfus	2011				ML	39.955601569563605	21.79475680208605	167877

And if this is the case, does there exist a general algorithm to transfer a program of T into a program of T−1? This is the inversion problem for computable linear operators on Banach spaces in its non-uniform and uniform formulation, respectively. We study this problem from the point of view of computable analysis which is the Turing machine based theory of computability on Euclidean space and other topological spaces. Using a computable version of Banach’s Inverse Mapping Theorem we can answer the first question positively. Hence, the non-uniform version of the inversion problem is solvable, while a topological argument shows that the uniform version is not. Thus, we are in the striking situation that any computable linear operator has a computable inverse while there exists no general algorithmic procedure to transfer a program of the operator into a program of its inverse. As a consequence, the computable version of Banach’s Inverse Mapping Theorem is a powerful tool which can be used to produce highly non-constructive existence proofs of algorithms. We apply this method to prove that a certain initial value problem admits a computable solution.	algorithm;computability theory;computable analysis;computable function;decision problem;existential quantification;turing machine	Vasco Brattka	2003		10.1007/3-540-36494-3_35	church's thesis;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;genetic algorithm;finite-rank operator;inverse problem;turing machine;euclidean space;mathematics;linear map;bounded operator;utm theorem;topological space;computability;algorithmics;computable function;computable number;banach space;initial value problem;recursive set;bounded inverse theorem;algorithm;linear space;computable analysis;gap theorem	Theory	46.84736069450796	24.28451408163691	169055

In the KLM scheme [2], quantum teleportation with linear optics is fundamental. Using 2n-modes ancillary system, we obtain the success probability n n+1 of quantum teleportation [2]–[4]. In the ordinal quantum teleportation scheme, an output state should be corrected corresponding to a set of measurement values [1]. In Ref. [2], it is stated that a phase shift is necessary to an output state. The angle of the phase shift, however, is not explicitly shown. The purpose of this letter is to exhibit a proper angle of the phase shift.	information theory;ordinal data;quantum information;quantum teleportation;two-phase commit protocol	Kazuto Oshima	2013	IEICE Transactions		quantum teleportation;quantum channel	Crypto	49.95808330575689	21.713699194297657	169244

This set turns out to be residual for equicontinuous surjective cellular automata, dense for almost equicontinuous surjective cellular automata, while it is empty for the positively expansive ones. In the class of additive cellular automata, the set of strictly temporally periodic points can be either dense or empty. The latter happens if and only if the cellular automaton is topologically transitive.	cellular automaton;chaos theory;dynamical system;existential quantification;formal proof;initial condition;mixing (mathematics);utility functions on indivisible goods	Alberto Dennunzio;Pietro Di Lena;Luciano Margara	2012		10.4204/EPTCS.90.18	stochastic cellular automaton;cellular automaton;reversible cellular automaton;block cellular automaton;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;continuous spatial automaton;computer science;continuous automaton;ω-automaton;mathematics;mobile automaton;timed automaton;algorithm	Theory	43.38944771423139	28.666700782343593	169730

11ab31483f47fe2212cd068986178e8e3ff33b3f	any beamsplitter generates universal quantum linear optics		In 1994, Reck et al. showed how to realize any linear-optical unitary transformation using a product of beamsplitters and phaseshifters. Here we show that any single beamsplitter that nontrivially mixes two modes, also densely generates the set of m×m unitary transformations (or orthogonal transformations, in the real case) on m ≥ 3 modes. (We prove the same result for any 2-mode real optical gate, and for any 2-mode optical gate combined with a generic phaseshifter.) Experimentally, this means that one does not need tunable beamsplitters or phaseshifters for universality: any nontrivial beamsplitter is universal. Theoretically, it means that one cannot produce “intermediate” models of quantum-optical computation (analogous to the Clifford group for qubits) by restricting the allowed beamsplitters and phaseshifters: there is a dichotomy; one either gets a trivial set or else a universal set. No similar classification theorem for gates acting on qubits is currently known. We leave open the problem of classifying optical gates that act on 3 or more modes.	computation;experiment;quantum;qubit;universality probability	Adam Bouland;Scott Aaronson	2013	Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity (ECCC)		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;pure mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	41.23700867744611	26.105850204919687	169934

22f7ac2e430349c7ca482802d2459b045a15219d	discrete geometry for computer imagery - preface		Preface This special issue mainly contains some extended versions of selected papers presented at the 8th Discrete Geometry for Computer Imagery Conference (DGCI), held in Marne-la-Vall* ee, ESIEE, France, 17–19 March 1999 and organized by Gilles Bertrand, Michel Couprie and Laurent Perroton. The proceedings of the DGCI’99 conference have been published by Springer Verlag, Vol. 1568, of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series under the title “Discrete Geometry for Computer Imagery”. The main goal of DGCI conferences is to provide a forum for researchers and to allow exchanges of ideas and methods on discrete notions related to computer imagery. Discrete geometry provides both theoretical and algorithmic models for the processing,analysis and synthesis of images; in return, computer imagery, in its variety of applications, constitutes a remarkable experimentational <eld and a rich source of challenging problems. In this context some fundamental discrete objects are of particular interest: • Subsets of the set of relative integers Zn: appropriate adjacency relations linking elements of Zn allow to recover some basic notions which are “topological” in nature, i.e., some notions such as connectedness which do not depend on size or shape. • Cellular complexes such as cubic or simplicial complexes which satisfy the Hausdorf axioms for a topological space. • Arithmetical structures such as diophantine equations which enable to take into account both the geometrical shape of objects and their discrete nature. The papers included in this volume investigate some of the most challenging questions related to these objects, for example: • How to de<ne discrete equivalents of objects such as planes, surfaces, disks? • How to reconstruct an object from its projections? • How to transform a discrete object while preserving its topological features? • What is a relevant discretization scheme? We expect that this special issue will also be of interest for researchers working in other related <elds such as Computational Geometry, Mathematical Morphology or Computational Complexity. Finally, we wish to thank Maurice Nivat, Editor-in-Chief of Theoretical Computer Science, for inviting us to produce this special issue.	bertrand (programming language);computation;computational complexity theory;computational geometry;cubic function;discretization;laurent polynomial;lecture notes in computer science;linear algebra;mandelbrot set;mathematical morphology;maurice herlihy;peano axioms;simplicial complex;springer (tank);theoretical computer science	Gilles Bertrand;Rémy Malgouyres	2002	Theor.

The theory involves a notion of irreducibility with respect to set partitions and the enumeration formulas that arise result from a generalization of the well-known “exponential formula.”	irreducibility	Janet Simpson Beissinger	1985	J.

It has also been applied to structures related to the real numbers, via approximations; we cite [3] as but one example. We are interested, however, in the problem of what operations in an arbitrary algebraic structure, possibly quite large and unnatural, can reasonably be considered “effective” in terms of the underlying operations and relations of the structure.

First, we show that affine rigidity can be determined by the rank of a specific matrix which implies that affine rigidity is a generic property of the hypergraph. Then we prove that if a graph is is (d+ 1)-vertex-connected, then it must be “generically neighborhood affinely rigid” in d-dimensional space. This implies that if a graph is (d+ 1)-vertex-connected then any generic framework of its squared graph must be universally rigid. Our results, and affine rigidity more generally, have natural applications in point registration and localization, as well as connections to manifold learning.	nonlinear dimensionality reduction	Steven J.

Burstall, University of Bath (M) Many special surfaces in classical differential geometry are characterised by the property that an appropriate Gauss map is harmonic and then the integrable features of their geometry (spectral deformation, Bäcklund transformation, algebro-geometric solutions and so on) can be inferred from those of harmonic maps. Thus a special case of the Ruh–Vilms theorem asserts that a surface has constant mean curvature if and only if its Gauss map is a harmonic map into the 2-sphere and, similarly, a surface has constant negative Gauss curvature if and only if its Gauss map is Lorentz harmonic with respect to the metric induced on the surface by the second fundamental form. It is interesting that harmonic maps into pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces also arise in this context: a surface in S is Willmore if and only if its conformal Gauss map is harmonic. This is a map into the indefinite Grassmannian that parametrises 2-spheres in S and geometrically represents a congruence of 2-spheres having partial second order contact with the Willmore surface. In this talk I report on work in progress with Udo Hertrich-Jeromin and show that similar constructions are available in Lie sphere and projective differential geometry.

We prove that every R0 algebra possesses at least one state. Moreover, we investigate states on weak R0 algebras and give some examples to show that, in contrast to R0 algebras, there exist weak R0 algebras which have no states. We also derive the condition under which finite linearly ordered weak R0 algebras have a state.	existential quantification	Lianzhen Liu;Xiangyang Zhang	2008	Soft Comput.	10.1007/s00500-008-0276-1	discrete mathematics;state;non-associative algebra;computer science;pure mathematics;jordan algebra;mathematics;algebra representation;quadratic algebra;interior algebra;nest algebra;algebra	Logic	43.49599320835851	27.471765981648527	174058

Commutative fundamental rings and the fundamental relation α which is the smallest strongly regular relation in hyperringswere introduced by Davvaz and Vougiouklis (2007). Recently, another strongly regular relation named θ on hyperrings has been studied by Ameri and Norouzi (2013). Ameri and Norouzi proved that θ is the smallest strongly regular relation such that R/θ is a commutative ring. In this paper, we show that θ ≠ α and θ is not the smallest strongly regular relation. Moreover, we show that some results of Ameri and Norouzi do not hold. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Hyperrings and fundamental relations (R, +, ·) is a hyperring if + and · are two hyperoperations such that (R, +) is a hypergroup, (R, ·) is a semihypergroup and the hyperoperation ‘‘ · ’’ is distributive over the hyperoperation ‘‘+’’, which means that for all x, y, z of R we have: x · (y + z) = x · y + x · z and (x + y) · z = x · z + y · z. We call (R, +, ·) a hyperfield if (R, +, ·) is a hyperring and (R, ·) is a hypergroup. There are different types of hyperrings. If only the addition + is a hyperoperation and the multiplication · is a usual operation, then we say that R is an additive hyperring. A special case of this type is the Krasner hyperring.

Mirvakili et al. / European Journal of Combinatorics 41 (2014) 258–261 259 recall the following definition from [3]. A Krasner hyperring is an algebraic structure (R, +, ·) which satisfies the following axioms: (1) (R, +) is a canonical hypergroup, i.e., x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z for all x, y, z ∈ R; x + y = y + x for all x, y ∈ R; there exists 0 ∈ R such that 0 + x = x for all x ∈ R; for every x ∈ R there exists a unique element x ∈ R such that 0 ∈ x + x (we shall write −x for x and we call it the opposite of x); z ∈ x + y implies that y ∈ −x + z and x ∈ z − y; (2) Relating to the multiplication, (R, ·) is a semigroup having zero as a bilaterally absorbing element; (3) The multiplication is distributive with respect to the hyperoperation +. An equivalence relation ρ is called strongly regular over a hyperring R, if the quotient R/ρ is a ring. For a hyperring R, we denote δR = {(x, x)|x ∈ R} and ∆R = R × R. At the fourth AHA congress [8] which took place in 1990, Vougiouklis introduced the concept of a fundamental relation on hyperrings, analyzed afterwards by himself and many other authors, for example see [4–6]. Remark 1. A relation ρ is the transitive closure of a binary relation ρ if (1) ρ is transitive, (2) ρ ⊆ ρ, (3) for any relation ρ , if ρ ⊆ ρ ′ and ρ ′ is transitive, then ρ ⊆ ρ , that is, ρ is the smallest relation that satisfies (1) and (2). Definition 1.1 ([8]). Let R be a hyperring. We define the relation Γ as follows: x Γ y ⇔ ∃n ∈ N, ∃ki ∈ N, ∃(xi1, . . . , xiki) ∈ R ki , 1 ≤ i ≤ n such that	emoticon;linear algebra;recurrence relation;strongly regular graph;transitive closure;turing completeness;utility functions on indivisible goods	S.

Although it has been deeply researched and widely used in classical image processing, its quantum version is a vacancy.

Two types of QIT: entire translation and cyclic translation are proposed by giving the quantum translation circuits. The translation in $$X$$X-direction and $$Y$$Y-direction is separable, and the circuits for translating right or left are different.	quantum	Jian Wang;Nan Jiang;Luo Wang	2015	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-014-0843-6	discrete mathematics;quantum information;theoretical computer science;quantum circuit;mathematics;quantum computer;physics;quantum mechanics	Arch	50.76630416842775	26.263222036787955	174944

Van Maldeghem (1998, “Generalized Polygons,” Birkhauser Verlag, Basel). Then we say that ? is fully and weakly embedded in the finite projective space PG(d, q) if ? is a subgeometry of the natural point-line geometry associated with PG(d, q), if s=q, if the set of points of ? generates PG(d, q), and if the set of points of ? not opposite any given point of ? does not generate PG(d, q). In three earlier papers we have shown that the dimension d of the projective space belongs to {6, 7, 8}, that the projective plane ? is Desarguesian, and we have classified the full and weak embeddings of ? (? as above) for d=6 and for d=7 in the case that there exists a line L of ? and four distinct lines L1, L2, L3, L4 concurrent with ? which generate a 4-dimensional space. In the present paper, we drop all these additional assumptions by completing the case d=7 and handling the case d=8. In particular, we find new examples for d=8 (contrary to our original conjecture (J. A. Thas and H. Van Maldeghem, Des. Codes Cryptogr.17 (1999), 97?104)). This means that we have now the complete classification of all fully and weakly embedded geometries ? in PG(d, q), with ? the flag geometry of a finite projective plane.	spaces	Joseph A.

A notion was introduced of geometric reduction and geometrically minimal realization based on transformations of arbitrary realizations of the given pulse response into each other, rather than on introducing some invariant of the dimensionality type. This notion was considered for the case of systems over the Boolean semiring: the geometrical reductions were classified, and various properties of the geometrically minimal realizations were studied. Some examples were discussed, as well as one class of non-geometric reductions which enabled us to explain the structure of some sets of geometrically minimal realizations.		Oleg O.

Using such forms, the decomposition of structural matrices into block diagonal forms, is considerably simplified. In this paper the main canonical forms are reviewed; and symmetric/regular structural configurations that can be explained with such forms are investigated. The invariant subspaces are formulated and the closed form solutions for the block-diagonalized stiffness matrices are provided in each case. Utility and robustness of the canonical forms in the analysis of structures exhibiting decomposable matrix patterns are demonstrated by numerous examples. Furthermore, a numerical method is proposed to extend the computational advantages of the matrix canonical forms to other nonconforming regular structures.		A. Kaveh;H. Fazli	2012	J. Math. Model.

For what concerns denseness of periodic points, we complete the work initiated in (Theoret. Comput. Sci. 174 (1997) 157, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 233 (1–2) (2000) 147, 14th Annual Symp. on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science (STACS ’97), LNCS n. 1200, Springer, Berlin, 1997, pp. 427–438) by proving that a linear cellular automata has dense periodic points over the entire space of con7gurations if and only if it is surjective (as conjectured in (Cattaneo et al., 2000)). For non-surjective linear CA we give a complete characterization of the subspace where periodic points are dense. For what concerns topological mixing, we prove that this property is equivalent to transitivity and then easily checkable.

To aid discussion, a fuzzy pre-metric condition is introduced. It is first pointed out that under the fuzzy pre-metric condition the first triangle inequality is always equivalent to its level form. The second triangle inequality is equivalent to one level form when R is right continuous, and to another level form also when further conditions are imposed on R. In a fuzzy metric space, the level form of the first triangle inequality and one of the level forms of the second triangle inequality are always valid. The other level form of the second triangle inequality holds for all but at most countable @a@?[0,1). Finally, a fixed point theorem for fuzzy metric spaces is derived as an application of the preceding results.		Huan Huang;Congxin Wu	2007	Inf.

It is shown that there exists a functor from a category of T3 spaces into a category of domain representations. Using this functor one may look at the subcategory of effective domain representations to get an effectivity theory for T3 spaces. However, this approach seems to be beset by some problems. Instead, a new approach to introducing effectivity to T3 spaces is given. The construction uses effective retractions on effective Scott–Ershov domains. The benefit of the approach is that the numbering of the basis and the numbering of the elements are derived at once.	computability;computable analysis;computable function;decision problem;effective domain;handbook;hausdorff dimension;hoc (programming language);information and computation;intuitionistic type theory;logic in computer science;mandelbrot set;numbering (computability theory);regular expression;spaces;springer (tank);tucker decomposition	Jens Blanck	2000		10.1007/3-540-45335-0_1	mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;concrete category	SE	44.403817451623006	28.27697319218141	177853

This way, we characterize the Hjelmslev-Moufang plane and its relatives (line Grassmannians, certain half-spin geometries and Segre geometries). At the same time we provide a more general framework for a lemma of Cohen, which is widely used to study parapolar spaces. As an application, if the geometries are embedded in a projective space, we provide a common characterization of (projections of) Segre varieties, line Grassmann varieties, half-spin varieties of low rank, and the exceptional variety E6,1 by means of a local condition on tangent spaces.	antimatroid;embedded system	Jeroen Schillewaert;Hendrik Van Maldeghem	2014	J.

Here's the deal. I've been playing with the question in the title on and off for more than a year now. I'm interested in both the answer to the question and in finding the clearest possible derivation of that answer. My first efforts were very algebra-intensive, but had an aura of concreteness about them. As I played with the question and went through innumerable drafts of this column, I came up with more and more elegant ways to ward off the brute-force algebra and make the answer more intuitive without reams of calculation. For these elegant techniques to work, however, I needed to build up a collection of tools (or Lemmas for the mathematically erudite) that themselves took a little time to explain. The tool that I described in part 1 of this column (the use of a particular matrix identity, which I will review here) popped up just before I started to write. I had to scrap my original idea for part 1 and rewrite it to describe this new tool. Using this tool to answer our big question has required major surgery to what you are now reading as part 2. I've already given you the answer to the big question: three. But deriving that answer in a clear and obvious manner is still a little ways away. But that's OK. The reason we're doing this is really not so much to answer the question as to build our intuition about the algebraic formulas and the geometry that they represent. Let's see, isn't there a phrase that encapsulates this idea? Oh yes: The journey is the reward. Definition So, let's reiterate what we're dealing with: paramet-ric cubic curves defined by the formula (1) We're interested in all points generated by this equation , for all values of T from −∞ to +∞. Infinite parameter values are easier to manipulate if we use a homogeneous parameterization, something like expressing the parameter in 1D homogeneous coordinates. I'll denote the homogeneous parameter coordinates as [t, s] where T = t/s. In terms of the homogeneous parameterization, the curve equation is (2) I'll bounce back and forth between the more familiar nonhomogeneous parameter T and homogeneous parameter representation [t, s] as clarity dictates. According to the homogeneous convention, any scalar multiple of a [t, s] coordinate represents the same para-metric point and will generate the same geometric point.

Moreover, we study the concept of symbolic representation for models. Amongst the results, we give some characterizations for dividing lines and combinatorial configurations such as independence property, order property and strictly order property in terms of symbolic representations.	theory	Alireza Mofidi	2018	Arch.

Herein, we choose Pauli operators \(\sigma _x \) and \(\sigma _z \) as a pair of observables of interest measuring on particle A, and the uncertainty can be predicted when particle A is entangled with quantum memory B. We explore the dynamics of the uncertainty for the measurement under local unitary (phase-damping) and nonunitary (amplitude-damping) channels, respectively. Remarkably, we derive the entropic uncertainty relation under three different kinds of measurements of Pauli-observable pair under various realistic noisy environments; it has been found that the entropic uncertainty has the same tendency of its evolution during the AD and PD channel when we choose \(\sigma _x \) and \(\sigma _y \) measurement. Besides, we find out that the entropic uncertainty will have an optimal value if one chooses \(\sigma _x \) and \(\sigma _z \) as the measurement incompatibility, comparing with others. Furthermore, in order to reduce the entropic uncertainty in noisy environment, we propose an effective strategy to steer the amount by means of implementing a filtering operation on the particle under the two types of channels, respectively. It turns out that this operation can greatly reduce the entropic uncertainty by modulation of the operation strength. Thus, our investigations might offer an insight into the dynamics and steering of the entropic uncertainty in an open system.	entropic uncertainty	Ai-Jun Huang;Jia-Dong Shi;Dong Wang;Liu Ye	2017	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-016-1503-9	classical mechanics;mathematics;quantum mechanics	ML	50.21606565899732	21.176056009122384	178370

f9dc22e12fd572fc5a2c51126f437254dc6da33f	tsallis entropy theory for modeling in water engineering: a review		Water engineering is an amalgam of engineering (e.g., hydraulics, hydrology, irrigation, ecosystems, environment, water resources) and non-engineering (e.g., social, economic, political) aspects that are needed for planning, designing and managing water systems. These aspects and the associated issues have been dealt with in the literature using different techniques that are based on different concepts and assumptions. A fundamental question that still remains is: Can we develop a unifying theory for addressing these? The second law of thermodynamics permits us to develop a theory that helps address these in a unified manner. This theory can be referred to as the entropy theory. The thermodynamic entropy theory is analogous to the Shannon entropy or the information theory. Perhaps, the most popular generalization of the Shannon entropy is the Tsallis entropy. The Tsallis entropy has been applied to a wide spectrum of problems in water engineering. This paper provides an overview of Tsallis entropy theory in water engineering. After some basic description of entropy and Tsallis entropy, a review of its applications in water engineering is presented, based on three types of problems: (1) problems requiring entropy maximization; (2) problems requiring coupling Tsallis entropy theory with another theory; and (3) problems involving physical relations.	ecosystem;entropy (information theory);entropy maximization;information theory;shannon (unit);tsallis entropy	Vijay P.

39e2271843531ff7aedda52aa75fdf4b1a5c0996	the cohomology of non-locality and contextuality		In a previous paper with Adam Brandenburger, we used sheaf th ory to analyze the structure of non-locality and contextuality. Moreover, on the basis of t his formulation, we showed that the phenomena of non-locality and contextuality can be characteri zed precisely in terms of obstructions to the existence of global sections. Our aim in the present work is to build on these results, and to use the powerful tools of sheaf cohomology to study the structure of non-locality and conte xtuality. We use the Cech cohomology on an abelian presheaf derived from the support of a probabil istic model, viewed as a compatible family of distributions, in order to define a cohomological o bstruction for the family as a certain cohomology class. This class vanishes if the family has a glo bal section. Thus the non-vanishing of the obstruction provides a sufficient (but not necessary) co nditi n for the model to be contextual. We show that for a number of salient examples, including PR bo xes, GHZ states, the PeresMermin magic square, and the 18-vector configuration due to C abello et al. giving a proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem in four dimensions, the obstructio n does not vanish, thus yielding cohomological witnesses for contextuality.	call of duty: black ops;entanglement witness;greenberger–horne–zeilinger state;kochen–specker theorem;locality of reference;pr/sm;robertson–seymour theorem;tom conte	Samson Abramsky;Shane Mansfield;Rui Soares Barbosa	2011		10.4204/EPTCS.95.1	discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;sheaf cohomology	ML	41.79590965663764	26.968337894313052	178976

Several di erent classes of domain representations are introduced and studied. It is investigated when it is possible to build domain representations from existing ones. It is, for example, discussed whether there exists a natural way to build a domain representation of a product of topological spaces from given domain representations of the factors. It is shown that any T0 topological space has a domain representation. These domain representations are very large. However, smaller domain representations are also constructed for large classes of spaces. For example, each second countable regular Hausdor space has a domain representation with a countable base. Domain representations of functions and function spaces are also studied. c © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.		Jens Blanck	2000	Theor. Comput.

We investigate the maximally achievable complexity function if ξ is taken from a constructively describable set of infinite words. Here we are interested in linear upper bounds where the slope is the Hausdorff dimension of the set. As sets we consider Π1-definable sets obtained by dilution and sets obtained from constructively describable infinite iterated function systems. In these cases, for a priori and monotone complexity, the upper bound coincides (up to an additive constant) with the lower bound, thus verifying the existence of oscillation-free maximally complex infinite words. ∗email: ludwig.staiger@informatik.uni-halle.de	complexity function;hausdorff dimension;iterated function system;iteration;kolmogorov complexity;map;omega language;utility functions on indivisible goods;verification and validation;monotone	Ludwig Staiger	2016	Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity (ECCC)			Theory	40.737507225047956	19.48655776843829	180335

Common geometric models for proteins and other molecules are the space-filling diagram, the solvent accessible surface and the molecular surface. In this paper we present a new approach to triangulating the surface of a molecule under the three models, which is fast, robust, and results in topologically correct triangulations. Our computations are based on a simplicial complex dual to the molecule models. All proposed algorithms are parallelizable.

For example, the set of faces of a hyperplane arrangement is endowed with a left regular band structure. This paper studies the module structure of the semigroup algebra of an arbitrary left regular band, extending results for the semigroup algebra of the faces of a hyperplane arrangement. In particular, a description of the quiver of the semigroup algebra is given and the Cartan invariants are computed. These are used to compute the quiver of the face semigroup algebra of a hyperplane arrangement and to show that the semigroup algebra of the free left regular band is isomorphic to the path algebra of its quiver.	encode;electronic band structure;quiver	Franco V.

84ff70786a535e5531487f03866db465d8becc5a	anchor maps and stable modules in depth two	hopf algebra;central simple algebra;representation theory;quantum algebra;smash product	An algebra extension A | B is right depth two if its tensor-square A ⊗ B A is in the Dress category Add B A A. We consider necessary conditions for right, similarly left, D2 extensions in terms of partial A-invariance of two-sided ideals in A contracted to the centralizer. Finite dimensional algebras extending central simple algebras are shown to be depth two. Following P. Xu, left and right bialgebroids over a base algebra R may be defined in terms of anchor maps, or representations on R. The anchor maps for the bialgebroids S = End B A B and T = End A A ⊗ B A A over the centralizer R = C A (B) are the modules S R and R T studied in [11, 15, 8], which provide information about the bialgebroids and the extension [9]. The anchor maps for the Hopf algebroids in [17, 10] reverse the order of right multiplication and action by a Hopf algebra element, and lift to the isomorphism in [20]. We sketch a theory of stable A-modules and their endomorphism rings and generalize the smash product decomposition in [7, Prop. 1.1] to any A-module. We observe that Schneider's coGalois theory in [21] provides examples of codepth two, such as the quotient epimorphism of a finite dimensional normal Hopf subalgebra.	apple maps;herman ring;hopf bifurcation;map;theory	Lars Kadison	2008	Applied Categorical Structures	10.1007/s10485-006-9053-4	representation theory;topology;central simple algebra;pure mathematics;hopf algebra;mathematics;quantum algebra;algebra	AI	41.5952821331174	29.423554584123856	180740
517b4f0eb9c77e0bee39609a9e6219dd678e49ae	preservation of saturation and stability in a variety of nilpotent groups		This paper is a contribution to the growing literature on the model theory of nilpotent groups. (See Baumslag and Levin [2]; Ersov [5]; Hodges [9], [10]; Mal′cev [14]; Olin [16] and Saracino [19], [20].) In it we investigate the conditions under which the free product in the variety of all nilpotent of class 2 (nil-2) groups preserves saturation and stability. It is well known that the direct product preserves both saturation (see Waszkiewicz and Wȩglorz [23]) and stability (see Wierzejewski [24]; Macintyre [13]; Eklof and Fisher [4]). On the other hand it is easy to show that the full free product of groups preserves neither property; indeed, in the case of saturation this failure is extremely bad since no free product of nontrivial groups is even 2-saturated. Our results show that the nil-2 free product falls between these two extremes. Our proofs are mainly model-theoretic with a smattering of elementary algebra and rely heavily upon the unique normal form for the elements of a nil-2 free product given by MacHenry in [12]. (This normal form and some of its consequences are discussed in §1.) We assume familiarity with the basic ideas of saturation (see Chapter 5 of [3]) and Shelahu0027s treatment of stability in [22]. We prove two main theorems in §3 each giving a necessary and sufficient condition in separate situations for the preservation of saturation. In the first (Theorem 3.1) we allow one finite factor, while in the second (Theorem 3.10) we deal solely with torsion groups. Our motivation for the proof of sufficiency was the paper of Waszkiewicz and Wȩglorz [23] and the principal tool is a “Feferman-Vaught” Theorem for the nil-2 free product which we prove in §2. We also show that if both factors in a nil-2 free product are nontorsion and one factor has a nil-2 basis, then the group is not even 3-saturated. We leave open the case where both factors are infinite but only one is torsion.		Pat Rogers	1981	J. Symb.

93e1dc777286a04939f06181ab7e4259dd85df79	fast algorithm for stochastic tree computation	tree growth;fast algorithm;tree structure;chronological age;recursive algorithm;growth cycle	In this paper, a recursive algorithm that can build complex tree structure quickly is presented briefly. The plant structural growth is based on a dual-scale automaton, in which ‘macrostate’ and ‘microstate’ are used to simulate the growth unit and the metamers inside growth unit separately. Each state is characterized by its ‘physiological age’. The automaton is non-deterministic in case that the probabilities exist in each growth cycle simulating the bud activity. Since the main plant structure and branches are statistically similar, and each structure can be decomposed into an axis and substructures, simulation is begun from smallest structures that have no further branch, and that information are used when such kind of structures appear in other branches. To keep the diversity of tree structure, several stochastic structures will be simulated at one time for a given physiological and chronological age. This algorithm can save a lot of time compared to node-by-node simulation. Verification is done both in organ number counting and visualization.	apache axis;automaton;computation;nondeterministic algorithm;recursion (computer science);simulation;tree structure	Meng-Zhen Kang;Philippe de Reffye;Jean François Barczi;Bao-Gang Hu	2003			segment tree;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;k-ary tree;tree structure;programming language;algorithm;recursion	Robotics	44.333628618374775	20.052446995357855	182835

By using these conditions and the triangle chain condition, we give general, topological and intuitive characterizations of the covering C for three types of covering-based upper approximation operators being closure operators. We also give descriptions of ( U , C ) in terms of information exchange systems when these operators are closure operators. These results answer an open problem raised in Ge et al. (2012). As an example application of our characterizations, we discuss the problem of implications among conditions for different types of covering-based upper approximation operators being closure operators.	approximation	Xiaoxia Bian;Pei Wang;Zuoming Yu;Xiaole Bai;Bin Chen	2015	Inf.

d12e33bf79e328b758e5370b0534c8724cdba594	c-compactness modulo an ideal		In the present paper, we consider a topological space equipped with an ideal, a theme that has been treated by Vaidyanathaswamy [15] and Kuratowski [6] in their classical texts. An ideal on a set X is a nonempty subset of P(X), the power set of X , which is closed for subsets and finite unions. An ideal is also called a dual filter. {φ} and P(X) are trivial examples of ideals. Some useful ideals are (i) f , the ideal of all finite subsets of X , (ii) c, the ideal of all countable subsets of X , (iii) n , the ideal of all nowhere dense subsets in a topological space (X ,τ), and (iv) s, the set of all scattered sets in (X ,τ). For an ideal on X and A⊂ X , we denote the ideal {I ∩A : I ∈ } by A. A topological space (X ,τ) with an ideal on X is denoted by (X ,τ, ). For a subset A⊆ X , A∗( ,τ) (called the adherence of A modulo an ideal ) or A∗( ) or just A∗ is the set {x ∈ X : A∩U / ∈ for every open neighborhood U of x}. A∗( ,τ) has been called the local function of A with respect to in [6]. It is easy to see that (i) for the ideal {φ}, A∗ is the closure of A, (ii) for the ideal P(X), A∗ is φ, and (iii) for ideal f , A∗ is the set of all ω-accumulation points of A. For general properties of the operator ∗, we refer the readers to [5, 14]. Observe that the operator cl∗ : P(X)→P(X) defined by cl∗(A)=A∪A∗ is a Kuratowski closure operator on X and hence generates a topology τ∗( ) or just τ∗ on X finer than τ. As has already been observed, τ∗({φ}) = τ and τ∗(P(X)) = the discrete topology. A description of open sets in τ∗( ) as given in Vaidyanathaswamy [15] is given in the following.	modulo operation;palais–smale compactness condition	Mridul Kumar Gupta;T. Noiri	2006	Int. J. Math.

db3ffd0df2bea3e9c952ea66b0674d53d12bcb80	on the coupling of an arbitrary number of angular momenta: generalized analytic approaches to clebsch-gordan decomposition of su(2) spin representations		The whole enterprise of Clebsch-Gordan decomposition (CGD) of an arbitrary collection of $SU(2)$ spin representations can be recast as a simple enumerative combinatoric problem. We show here that enumerative combinatorics (EC)citep{book:Stanley-2011} is a natural setting for CGD, and easily leads to very general analytic formulae -- so far not present in the literature. Based on it, we propose three general methods for computing spin multiplicities; namely, 1) the multi-restricted partition, 2) the generalized binomial and 3) the generating function methods. The last has already been recently discussed in the literature based on statistical mechanical considerationscite{art:Polychronakos-2016}, but here we show how it naturally surfaces within the EC approach. rnThe maximum of the resulting multiset of $SU(2)$ spin representations is easy to establish analytically, but not the minimum. We prove here an analytical equation for computing this minimum. Besides the application of our results to some problems in number theory and statistics, CGD connections to lattice paths and numbers usually encountered in counting problems like Catalan and Riordanu0027s are also briefly discussed.	angularjs;clebsch–gordan coefficients	Jerryman Appiahene Gyamfi;Vincenzo Barone	2017	CoRR		combinatorics;generating function;number theory;spin representation;partition (number theory);enumerative combinatorics;multiset;multiplicity (mathematics);spin-½;mathematics	Robotics	40.02541999114307	22.628304627709518	186519
45d08b9a342e7ef6d8815bde31d3d19206191dd1	on the equivalence of topological relations	topological space;2 dimensional;topological invariant;topological relation	The 4-intersection, a model for binary topological relations, is based on the intersections of the boundaries and interiors of two point sets in a topological space, considering the content invariant (i.e., emptiness/non-emptiness) of the intersections. If the 4-intersections of two pairs of point sets have different contents, then their topological relations are different as well; however, the reverse cannot be stated as there may be different topological relations that map onto a 4-intersection with the same content. This paper refines the model of empty/non-empty 4intersections with further topological invariants to account for more details about topological relations. The invariants used are the dimension of the components, their types (touching, crossing, and different refinements of crossings), their relationships with respect to the exterior neighborhoods, and the sequence of the components. These invariants, applied to non-empty boundary-boundary intersections, comprise a classification invariant for binary topological relations between homogeneously 2-dimensional, connected point sets (disks) in the plane such that if two different 4-intersections with the necessary invariants are equal, then their topological relationships are identical. The model presented applies to processing GIS queries about whether or not two pairs of spatial objects have the same topological relation and gives rise to the formal definition of topological similarity.	geographic information system;semantic similarity;turing completeness	Max J.

We give new equations, which are simpler than Bayer and Iarrobino-Kanev equations. These new Plücker-like equations define the Hilbert scheme as a subscheme of a single Grassmannian and are of degree two in the Plücker coordinates. This explicit complete set of defining equations for Hilb µ (P n) are deduced from the commutation relations characterising border bases and from generating equations. We also prove that the punctual Hilbert functor Hilb µ P n can be represented by the scheme Hilb µ (P n) defined by these relations and the well-known Plücker relations on the Grassmanian. A new description of the tangent space at a point of the Hilbert scheme, seen as a subvariety of the Grassmannian, is also given in terms of projections with respect to the underlying border basis.	canonical commutation relation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Mariemi Alonso;Jérôme Brachat;Bernard Mourrain	2009	CoRR		system of linear equations;stratification;projective space;mathematical analysis;projective hilbert space;symbolic computation;hilbert scheme;toric variety;topology;hilbert–poincaré series;hilbert r-tree;vector space;algebraic geometry;hilbert manifold;mathematics;geometry;deformation;flatness;algebra	Theory	50.9749119828615	32.00312245504799	187444

However, there was no good characterization of ideal ramp schemes that are not strong. Here we show the equivalence of ideal ramp schemes to a new variant of orthogonal arrays that we term augmented orthogonal arrays. We give some constructions for these new kinds of arrays, and, as a consequence, we also provide parameter situations where ideal ramp schemes exist but strong ideal ramp schemes do not exist.	jackson;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;turing completeness	Douglas R.

The first turns out to be rather pathological, in that the countable space becomes neither first-countable nor sequential. Also, reversible automata form a closed set, while surjective ones are dense. The second topology, which is induced by a metric, is studied in more detail. Continuity of composition (under certain restrictions) and inversion, as well as closedness of the set of surjective automata, are proved, and some counterexamples are given. We then generalize this space, in the sense that every shift-invariant measure on the configuration space induces a pseudometric on cellular automata, and study the properties of these spaces. We also characterize the pseudometric spaces using the Besicovitch distance, and show a connection to the first (pathological) space.	automata theory;cellular automaton;scott continuity	Ville Salo;Ilkka Törmä	2012		10.4204/EPTCS.90.5	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;quantum finite automata;mathematics;trivial topology;mobile automaton;algorithm;pseudometric space	Theory	40.890402886879144	26.61582762312762	188105

7c69b6909c9808b8d6ef0dc77a310ae86a5d6d2c	rotating a qubit	quantum computer	The state function of a quantum object is undetermined with respect to its phase. Can useful computations be performed in spite of this indeterminacy? We consider this question in relation to the problem of the rotation of a qubit. Introduction Quantum mechanics provides us a means of extracting information about a physical system, but this information depends on the manner in which the system is prepared and the measurement apparatus deployed. The state function of the system is defined on the complex plane whereas the observations can only be real, which means that the state function cannot be completely known. For pure states, there exists the uncertainty of phase. In a recent paper [1] the author discussed the implications of phase uncertainty for initializing the state of a quantum register. We return to this problem here to focus on the difficulty of controlling the evolution of a quantum state, which is essential to do in a useful quantum computation. Preparing a qubit For simplicity, we consider a qubit, which is a quantum state of the form |φ〉 = αe1 |0〉 + βe2 |1〉, where α, β ∈ R and α + β = 1. A qubit may be prepared by starting with an available superposition state and transforming it into the desired superposition state by applying a unitary transformation. The simplest way to prepare a pure state is to subject qubits to a test and discard all the qubits that do not yield the desired outcome. Pure states are unit vectors along a set of orthogonal axes. Examples would be e1 |0〉 or e2 |1〉 at angles of 0 or 90 degrees; other orthogonal axes could likewise be chosen. The standard basis observables are |0〉 and |1〉.	computation;nondeterministic algorithm;observable;quantum computing;quantum mechanics;quantum register;quantum state;qubit	Subhash C. Kak	2000	Inf.

a295ece743cca69c0e62ca8d9873c66b6d3ce4de	dynamical aspects of involutive bases computations	computer experiment;choice function	The article is a contribution to a more efficient computation of involutive bases. We present an algorithm which computes a 'sliced division'. A sliced division is an admissible partial division in the sense of Apel. Admissibility requires a certain order on the terms. Instead of ordering the terms in advance, our algorithm additionally returns such an order for which the computed sliced division is admissible. Our algorithm gives rise to a whole class of sliced divisions since there is some freedom to choose certain elements in the course of its run. We show that each sliced division refines the Thomas division and thus leads to terminating completion algorithms for the computation of involutive bases. A sliced division is such that its cones 'cover' a relatively 'big' part of the term monoid generated by the given terms. The number of prolongations that must be considered during the involutive basis algorithm is tightly connected to the dimensions and number of the cones. By some computer experiments, we show how this new division can be fruitful for the involutive basis algorithm.#R##N##R##N#We generalise the sliced division algorithm so that it can be seen as an algorithm which is parameterised by two choice functions and give particular choice functions for the computation of the classical divisions of Janet, Pommaret, and Thomas.	computation;dynamical system	Ralf Hemmecke	2001		10.1007/3-540-45084-X_7	discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm;algebra	Theory	42.69566827624659	29.955448056017524	188894

We demonstrate that any set of linearly independent multipartite pure quantum states can be locally unambiguously discriminated if the number of states in the set is no more than $$\max \{d_{i}\}$$max{di}, where the space spanned by the set can be expressed in the irreducible form $$\otimes _{i=1}^{N}d_{i}$$?i=1Ndi and $$d_{i}$$di is the optimal local dimension of the $$i\hbox {th}$$ith party.

We also show that it is tight, namely there exists a set of $$\max \{d_{i}\}+1$$max{di}+1 states, in which at least one of the states cannot be locally unambiguously discriminated. Our result gives the reason why the multiqubit system is the only exception when any three quantum states are locally unambiguously distinguished.	quantum state	Yinghui Yang;Fei Gao;Guo-Jing Tian;Tian-Qing Cao;Huijuan Zuo;Qiaoyan Wen	2015	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-014-0870-3	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;quantum information;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;physics;quantum mechanics	Theory	48.43185496721758	21.661513286902082	190503

This association gives a Hopf algebra map from the Hopf algebra of (isomorphism classes) of matroids to QSym, the Hopf algebra of all quasisymmetric functions, displaying interesting matroid invariants when expressed in terms of the fundamental basis for QSym. More interesting is the fact that F (M) can be used to detect when the matroid polytope P (M) can be decomposed into the matroid polytopes of degenerations of M . The proof of this depends on a result of Lawrence. Such decompositions have been of interest to Lafforgue in his study of compactifications of certain quotients of Grassmanians.

cd07e563f75b35438bd03e3208f60f6d33d7bd4c	probability, entropy, and gibbs' paradox(es)		Two distinct puzzles, which are both known as Gibbs’ paradox, have interested physicists since they were first identified in the 1870s. They each have significance for the foundations of statistical mechanics and have led to lively discussions with a wide variety of suggested resolutions. Most proposed resolutions had involved quantum mechanics, although the original puzzles were entirely classical and were posed before quantum mechanics was invented. In this paper, I show that contrary to what has often been suggested, quantum mechanics is not essential for resolving the paradoxes. I present a resolution of the paradoxes that does not depend on quantum mechanics and includes the case of colloidal solutions, for which quantum mechanics is not relevant.	gibbs' inequality;lively kernel;paradox (database);quantum mechanics	Robert H.

eb4d3a43151691c47b5b7bdd06c28ee6a05de36d	a semidiscrete version of the petitot model as a plausible model for anthropomorphic image reconstruction and pattern recognition		Preface In his beautiful book [54], Jean Petitot proposes a subriemannian model for the primary visual cortex of mammals. This model is neurophysiologically justified. Further developments of this theory lead to efficient algorithms for image reconstruction , based upon the consideration of an associated hypoelliptic diffusion. The subriemannian model of Petitot (or certain of its improvements) is a left-invariant structure over the group SE(2) of rototranslations of the plane. Here, we propose a semi-discrete version of this theory, leading to a left-invariant structure over the group SE(2, N), restricting to a finite number of rotations. This apparently very simple group is in fact quite atypical: it is maximally almost periodic, which leads to much simpler harmonic analysis compared to SE(2). Based upon this semi-discrete model, we improve on the image-reconstruction algorithms and we develop a pattern-recognition theory that leads also to very efficient algorithms in practice.	algorithm;almost periodic function;iterative reconstruction;jean;pattern recognition;semiconductor industry	Dario Prandi;Jean-Paul Gauthier	2017	CoRR		computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence	Vision	44.10904268529637	31.572728500333536	193006

175704345cd2168e4be4f34fad3c4ac0201b7ee5	invariants for multidimensional persistence	mathematics;matematik	The amount of data that our digital society collects is unprecedented. This represents a valuable opportunity to improve our quality of life by gaining insights about complex problems related to neuroscience, medicine and biology among others. Topological methods, in combination with classical statistical ones, have proven to be a precious resource in understanding and visualizing data. Multidimensional persistence is a method in topological data analysis which allows a multi-parameter analysis of a dataset through an algebraic object called multidimensional persistence module. Multidimensional persistence modules are complicated and contain a lot of information about the input data. This thesis deals with the problem of algorithmically describing multidimensional persistence modules and extracting information that can be used in applications. The information we extract, through invariants, should not only be efficiently computable and informative but also robust to noise. In Paper A we describe in an explicit and algorithmic way multidimensional persistence modules. This is achieved by studying the multifiltration of simplicial complexes defining multidimensional persistence modules. In particular we identify the special structure underlying the modules of n-chains of such multifiltration and exploit it to write multidimensional persistence modules as the homology of a chain complex of free modules. Both the free modules and the homogeneous matrices in such chain complex can be directly read off the multifiltration of simplicial complexes. Paper B deals with identifying stable invariants for multidimensional persistence. We introduce an algebraic notion of noise and use it to compare multidimensional persistence modules. Such definition allows not only to specify the properties of a dataset we want to study but also what should be neglected. By disregarding noise the, so called, persistent features are identified. We also propose a stable discrete invariant which collects properties of persistent features in a multidimensional persistence module.	algorithm;computable function;homology (biology);information;invariant (computer science);linear algebra;persistence (computer science);simplicial complex;topological data analysis;transformation matrix	Martina Scolamiero	2015			simulation;mathematics;social psychology	DB	41.675056536690285	22.257997014912984	194371
41f89c018dbe8559ea5e50ec1b3547f47fd461ac	a dynamical system using the voronoï tessellation	dynamic system;voronoi tessellation	Suppose you know the locations of post offices or cell phone satellites, and you want to know what regions they serve. Or maybe you know the locations of atoms in a crystal, and you want to know what a fundamental region looks like. There are lots of reasons you might want to make a tiling around a given discrete set of points. A natural way to do it is with “Voronöı tessellations”—so natural, in fact, that it has been rediscovered numerous times over the years. On the other hand, if you have a tiling, you might want to decorate each tile with a few points to create or destroy symmetry. Or you might look at all the vertices of the tiling—points where three or more tiles meet—to extract combinatorial information. If you have a tiling, there are many ways to obtain a point set from it. So, you can get tilings from point sets and point sets from tilings: doesn’t this give you a way to associate point sets to point sets or tilings to tilings? Once you have a map from a class of objects back to itself, you can take a dynamical systems viewpoint to analyze the situation. In this paper we are going to do exactly that, with a new dynamical system based on the vertices of Voronöı tessellations. For those uninitiated with the Voronöı tessellation, we begin with its definition and then give the definition of our dynamical system. From there, the remainder of §1 is spent exploring the evolution of simple point sets, using these simplified examples to develop both the intuition and vocabulary needed for more interesting cases. In §2 we give a new proof of a theorem, first proved in [4], quantifying the growth in size of point sets over repeated iteration. Following that we will point out some interesting corollaries and give some estimates on the growth rate. We devote §3 to discussing what questions interest us most from the dynamical systems viewpoint. For now, let’s turn to the definitions.	butterfly effect;dynamical system;fundamental domain;initial condition;iteration;mobile phone;tessellation (computer graphics);tiling window manager;vertex (geometry);vocabulary;voronoi diagram	Natalie Priebe Frank;Sean M.

Three different monotonicity conditions that yield different types of aggregation operators are discussed and the structure of these aggregation operators on f0;1; . . . ;mg with additional properties of associativity and commutativity is studied for any m 2 N. The commutative associative Boolean multi-polar aggregation operators are shown to coincide with Boolean multi-polar uninorms. The structure of commutative associative SL aggregation operators is shown to be dependent on the structure of the class of Abelian idempotent semigroups based on mþ 1 elements with an annihilator. We show that each commutative associative SL aggregation operator with annihilator 0 corresponds to a lower semi-lattice with bottom element 0. For m > 2 the class of commutative associative C aggregation operators is proved to be equal to the intersection of the class of commutative associative Boolean multi-polar aggregation operators and the class of commutative associative SL aggregation operators.

The results are applied via order isomorphy to the ordinal structure of the sawtooth maps x ↦ Nx mod 1 and the baker map.

Using screw theory, a twist graph is introduced in order to simplify the constrai nt analysis of such manipulators. Then, a wrench graph is obtained in order to represent some points at infinity on the Plücker lines of the Jacobian matrix. Using GrassmannCayley algebra, the rank deficiency of the Jacobian matrix amounts to the vanishing condition of the superbracket. Accordingly, the parallel singularities are expressed in thr ee different forms involving superbrackets, meet and join ope rators, and vector cross and dot products, respectively. The approach is explained through the singularity analysis of t he H4 robot. All the singularity conditions of this robot are enumerated and the motions associated with these singularitie s are characterized.	angular defect;enumerated type;jacobian matrix and determinant;magma;monomial;reflow soldering;robot end effector;technological singularity	Semaan Amine;Stéphane Caro;Philippe Wenger;Daniel Kanaan	2012	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574711001330	singularity;projective space;essential singularity;combinatorics;topology;mathematics;geometry;isolated singularity;screw theory;singularity theory;singularity function	Robotics	39.36242182986302	23.026118902148347	194629

For this purpose two series of measures arc defined, using cyclic transformations and their inversions. The homogeneity and symmetry measures were found to be equal for special cases. The invariance properties of the different measures were analysed and related to the theory of symmetry groups of dieders. Further, the relationships of the measures to the theory of finite Fourier analysis, correlation theory, and the entropy concept of information theory are outlined. For the concatenation of two sequences X and Y, “superadditivity”, i.e. N( XY) > H( A’)+ H( Y). holds for homogeneity and symmetry in most cases, and for a modified definition of homogeneity in every case-just complementary to the subadditivity of various complexity measures known from the literature.	classical xy model;concatenation;fourier analysis;information theory;inversion (discrete mathematics)	Michael Krüger	1983	Inf.

We prove that two graphs as above are isospectral if and only if they are representation-isospectral. In other w ords, for a cocompact torsion-free latticeΓ in G the spherical part of the spectrum of Γ determines the whole spectrum. We give examples to show that this is not the case if the lattice has torsion. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 0.

In this article, we analyze different dimensional concepts of complete (ortho)lattices and their tensor products. The determination of these dimensions can be translated to certain set cover problems and the cardinal product of the complementary underlying formal contexts. To treat this cover problems in a unified manner, we take a more universal approach via the general set cover problem and its product. This yields a sufficient condition for the multiplicativity of various lattice dimensions with respect to the tensor product of complete lattices.	formal concept analysis;graph coloring;set cover problem;theory	Christian Jäkel;Stefan E.

The general goal of geometric inference is then to recover geometric and topological features (eg. Betti numbers, normals) of this subset from the approximating point cloud data. In recent years, it appeared that the study of distance functions allows to address many of these questions successfully. However, one of the main limitations of this framework is that it does not cope well with outliers nor with background noise. In this paper, we show how to extend the framework of distance functions to overcome this problem. Replacing compact subsets by measures, we introduce a notion of distance function to a probability distribution in R. These functions share many properties with classical distance functions, which make them suitable for inference purposes. In particular, by considering appropriate level sets of these distance functions, we show that it is possible to reconstruct offsets of sampled shapes with topological guarantees even in the presence of outliers. Moreover, in settings where empirical measures are considered these functions can be easily evaluated, making them of particular practical interest.	betti number;betti's theorem;point cloud	Frédéric Chazal;David Cohen-Steiner;Quentin Mérigot	2011	Foundations of Computational Mathematics	10.1007/s10208-011-9098-0	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;computational topology;density estimation;topology;surface reconstruction;mean-shift;total variation distance of probability measures;mathematics;geometry;distance;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;statistics	Theory	39.99830887634414	19.31621858854984	196258

We study the relationships between de nitions of compactness in topologicalspaces and the roll the axiom of choice plays in these relationships. 1. Introduction and DefinitionsWe have found several de nitions of compactness which have been used in the literatureand our goal is to nd the relationships between these de nitions in various types oftopological spaces. In this article we use three basic forms of set theory: ZF, which usesthe axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (and does not include AC); ZF 0 ,whichisaweaker version of ZF in which the axiom of extensionality is modi ed to allow the presenceof atoms, objects which have no elements but are not equal to each other or to the emptyset; and ZFC which is Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the addition of the Axiom ofChoice. ZF 0 is relevant in our study because there is a well-known method for producingmodels of ZF 0 + :AC, namely, Fraenkel-Mostowski permutation models.The notion of compactness is meant to capture, in the context of general topology,the properties that characterize spaces which are closed and bounded subsets of a Eu-clidean space (see [th]). However, several topological properties that characterize closedand bounded subsets of Euclidean spaces (for example: the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem,(Every in nite bounded subset (sequence) of R	kinetic data structure	Omar De la Cruz;Eric J.

If is bounded onX0 it holds thatJ ,p; (X̄)= J ,p(X0∩ ker , X1). These spaces have been studied by Kalton, Ivanov and Löfström. Their results will follow as corollaries to the more general results of this article and our new theory can be thought of as a theory for generalized subcouples of codimension one. In the last section, we apply our theory to a situation considered by Krugljak, Maligranda and Persson in connection with Hardy-type inequalities. We prove new results and provide a new way of understanding that kind of problems. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

cf1542d16581edac3a83ec11b02d02023dfc1f37	exploiting the structure of bipartite graphs for algebraic and spectral graph theory applications		In this article, we extend several algebraic graph analysis methods to bipartite networks. In various areas of science, engineering and commerce, many types of information can be represented as networks, and thus the discipline of network analysis plays an important role in these domains. A powerful and widespread class of network analysis methods is based on algebraic graph theory, i.e., representing graphs as square adjacency matrices. However, many networks are of a very specific form that clashes with that representation: They are bipartite. That is, they consist of two node types, with each edge connecting a node of one type with a node of the other type. Examples of bipartite networks (also called two-mode networks) are persons and the social groups they belong to, musical artists and the musical genres they play, and text documents and the words they contain. In fact, any type of feature that can be represented by a categorical variable can be interpreted as a bipartite network. Although bipartite networks are widespread, most literature in the area of network analysis focuses on unipartite networks, i.e., those networks with only a single type of node. The purpose of this article is to extend a selection of important algebraic network analysis methods to bipartite networks, showing that many methods from algebraic graph theory can be applied to bipartite networks with only minor modifications. We show methods for clustering, visualization and link prediction. Additionally, we introduce new algebraic methods for measuring the bipartivity in near-bipartite graphs.	adjacency matrix;algebraic graph theory;bipartite double cover;categorical variable;cluster analysis;document;folksonomy;linear algebra;map;network theory;semantic network;singular value decomposition;social network analysis;spectral graph theory;time complexity	Jérôme Kunegis	2015	Internet Mathematics	10.1080/15427951.2014.958250	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;bipartite graph;computer science;3-dimensional matching;theoretical computer science;forbidden graph characterization;factor graph;clustering coefficient;mathematics;biregular graph;algorithm;adjacency matrix	ML	41.254172012545546	20.746927620639763	197763

A notation arbitrarily encoded for a structure by a user through a rather simple procedure using 35 codes, which have been previously prepared, is automatically canonicalized in a computer. The notation given by the user is standardized according to the rules for rearranging the codes into a dictionary order. The connectivity stack is estimated for each of the standard notations and its permuted derivatives. The notation whose stack is the largest amount is decided to be canonical. This notation method will be widely applicable in the field of structure manipulation because of its extreme simplicity.	code;dictionary	Hidetsugu Abe;Yoshihiro Kudo;Tohru Yamasaki;Kazuo Tanaka;Masahiro Sasaki;Shin-ichi Sasaki	1984	Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences	10.1021/ci00044a005	combinatorics;computer science;theoretical computer science;algorithm	Comp.	45.223969250505135	20.49639631523815	198287

65a9a92de051d8209a9bc240cc83a81139c7f860	first order tameness of measures		Abstract We develop a general framework for measure theory and integration theory that is compatible with o-minimality. Therefore the following natural definitions are introduced. Given are an o-minimal structure M and a Borel measure μ on some R n . We say that μ is M - compatible if there is an o-minimal expansion of M such that for every parameterized family of subsets of R n that is definable in M the corresponding family of μ -measures is definable in this o-minimal expansion. We say that μ is M -tame if there is an o-minimal expansion of M such that for every parameterized family of functions on R n that is definable in M the corresponding family of integrals with respect to μ is definable in this o-minimal expansion. We substantiate these definitions with existing and many new examples. We investigate the Lebesgue measure in their light. We prove definable versions of fundamental results such as the theorem of Radon–Nikodym, the Lebesgue decomposition theorem and the Riesz representation theorem. They allow us to describe explicitly compatible and tame measures and to classify them in dimension one.	a.j. han vinck;wilkie investment model	Tobias Kaiser	2012	Ann. Pure Appl.

Depending on the strength of an arc, this paper classifies arcs of a fuzzy graph into three types namely @a-strong, @b-strong and @d-arcs. The advantage of this type of classification is that it helps in understanding the basic structure of a fuzzy graph completely. We analyze the relation between strong paths and strongest paths in a fuzzy graph and obtain characterizations for fuzzy bridges, fuzzy trees and fuzzy cycles using the concept of @a-strong, @b-strong and @d-arcs. An arc of a fuzzy tree is @a-strong if and only if it is an arc of its unique maximum spanning tree. Also we identify different types of arcs in complete fuzzy graphs.	arcs (computing);algorithm;artificial neural network;context-free grammar;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;graph theory;turing completeness	Sunil Mathew;M.

In the smooth case, it is proved that smooth bwt-norms reduces to smooth t-norms, whereas a classification of smooth t-subnorms as ordinal sums of a smooth t-norm and an Archimedean smooth t-subnorm is proved, in a similar way as in the case of [0,1]. With respect to Archimedean smooth t-subnorms, some cases depending on their zero-region are considered, classifying all of them in some cases and some specific families in others. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In terms of the theory of automata, this is a minimal finite inverse automaton. This allows for the deep algorithmic theory of finite automata and finite inverse monoids to be used to answer questions about finitely generated subgroups of free groups. In this paper we attempt to apply the same methods to other classes of groups. A fundamental new problem is that the Stallings folding algorithm must be modified to allow for “sewing” on relations of nonfree groups. We look at the class of groups that are amalgams of finite groups. It is known that these groups are locally quasiconvex and thus all finitely generated subgroups are represented by finite automata. We present an algorithm to compute such a finite automaton and use it to solve various algorithmic problems.	algorithm;automata theory;automaton;finite-state machine;immersion (virtual reality);quasiconvex function	L.

3314934ae0dc8bf55c8b4829fb3e50e587f8e2e7	singularities of plane rational curves via projections		We consider the parameterization ${\mathbf{f}}=(f_0,f_1,f_2)$ of a plane rational curve $C$ of degree $n$, and we want to study the singularities of $C$ via such parameterization. We do this by using the projection from the rational normal curve $C_n\subset \mathbb{P}^n$ to $C$ and its interplay with the secant varieties to $C_n$. In particular, we define via ${\mathbf{f}}$ certain 0-dimensional schemes $X_k\subset \mathbb{P}^k$, $2\leq k\leq (n-1)$, which encode all information on the singularities of multiplicity $\geq k$ of $C$ (e.g. using $X_2$ we can give a criterion to determine whether $C$ is a cuspidal curve or has only ordinary singularities). We give a series of algorithms which allow to get info about the singularities from such schemes.		Alessandra Bernardi;Alessandro Gimigliano;Monica Idà	2018	J. Symb.

858a60ec4b026b0ec2ee12cd005de5458906c2b5	on the computation of sets of points with low lebesgue constant on the unit disk		Abstract In this paper of numerical nature, we test the Lebesgue constant of several available point sets on the disk Ω and propose new ones that enjoy low Lebesgue constant. Furthermore we extend some results in Cuyt (2012), analyzing the case of Bos arrays whose radii are nonnegative Gauss–Gegenbauer–Lobatto nodes with exponent α , noticing that the optimal α still allows to achieve point sets on Ω with low Lebesgue constant Λ n for degrees n ≤ 30 . Next we introduce an algorithm that through optimization determines point sets with the best known Lebesgue constants for n ≤ 25 . Finally, we determine theoretically a point set with the best Lebesgue constant for the case n = 1 .	computation;lebesgue constant (interpolation)	Gérard Meurant;Alvise Sommariva	2019	J.
