f8dd4574bb3b1e75b087e742ac69acacdc32f912	extended norm-trace codes with optimized correction capability	generalization error;satisfiability;finite field	We consider a generalization of the codes defined by norm and trace functions on finite fields introduced by Olav Geil. The codes in the new family still satisfy Geil’s duality properties stated for normtrace codes. That is, it is easy to find a minimal set of parity checks guaranteeing correction of a given number of errors, as well as the set of monomials generating the corresponding code. Furthermore, we describe a way to find the minimal set of parity checks and the corresponding generating monomials guaranteeing correction at least of generic errors. This gives codes with even larger dimensions.	code;linear code;monomial;parity bit;parity-check matrix	Maria Bras-Amorós;Michael E.

In the proposed Viterbi decoder, the CNN cells with nonlinear unilateral connections are implemented with electronic circuits at nodes on a trellis diagram. The circuits are circularly connected, forming a cylindrical shape so that the cells of the last stage are connected to those of the first stage. Unilateral connections guide the information to flow circularly around the cylindrical surface. Such configuration enables the conceptually infinite length of the trellis diagram to be reduced to a circuit of limited size. The analog circuits does not require any analog-digital converters, which is the major cause of high power consumption and the quantization error. With the parallel analog processing structure, its decoding speed becomes very high. Also, the decoding mechanism using triggering wave of the CNN circuit does not require the path memory. Circuits for the proposed structure have been designed with HSPICE. Features of the proposed Viterbi decoder are compared with those of the conventional digital Viterbi decoder.	analogue electronics;artificial neural network;best, worst and average case;cmos;cellular neural network;convolutional code;diagram;digital-to-analog converter;electronic circuit;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;parallel computing;quantization (signal processing);spice 2;simulation;transistor;trellis quantization;viterbi algorithm;viterbi decoder	Hyongsuk Kim;Hongrak Son;Tamás Roska;Leon O.

In this paper, a simplified decoding algorithm to correct both errors and erasures is used in conjunction with the Euclidean algorithm for efficiently decoding nonsystematic RS codes. In fact, this decoding algorithm is an appropriate modification to the algorithm developed by Shiozaki and Gao. Based on the ideas presented above, a fast algorithm described from Blahut's classic book is derivated and proved in this paper to correct erasures as well as errors by replacing the Euclidean algorithm by the Berlekamp-Massey (BM) algorithm. These facts lead to significantly reduce the decoding complexity of the proposed RS decoder. In addition, computer simulations show that this simple and fast decoding technique reduces the decoding time when compared with existing efficient algorithms including the new Euclidean-algorithm-based decoding approach proposed in this paper.	berlekamp–massey algorithm;central processing unit;computer simulation;euclid;euclidean algorithm;folded reed–solomon code;forney algorithm;interpreter (computing);linear canonical transformation;online locator service;polynomial long division;recursion;reed–solomon error correction;text simplification	Tsung-Ching Lin;Trieu-Kien Truong;Hsin-Chiu Chang;Hung-Peng Lee	2011	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2011.050211.100170	euclidean algorithm;list decoding;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;berlekamp–massey algorithm;sequential decoding;interpolation;discrete fourier transform;mathematical model;mathematics;computational complexity theory;berlekamp–welch algorithm;reed–solomon error correction;algorithm;statistics;polynomial	Vision	43.17039549351554	59.95936314462836	79152

STBCs satisfying these sufficient conditions were named as Clifford Unitary Weight (CUW) codes. In this paper, the maximal rate (as measured in complex symbols per channel use) of CUW codes for lambda = 2alpha, alpha epsiv N is obtained using tools from representation theory. Two algebraic constructions of codes achieving this maximal rate are also provided. One of the constructions is obtained using linear representation of finite groups whereas the other construction is based on the concept of right module algebra over non-commutative rings. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first paper in which matrices over non-commutative rings is used to construct STBCs. An algebraic explanation is provided for the 'ABBA' construction first proposed by Tirkkonen et al and the tensor product construction proposed by Karmakar et al. Furthermore, it is established that the 4 transmit antenna STBC originally proposed by Tirkkonen et al based on the ABBA construction is actually a single complex symbol ML decodable code if the design variables are permuted and signal sets of appropriate dimensions are chosen.	channel use;code;copper–tungsten;linear algebra;maximal set	G.

It is a difficult problem how to obtain the optimal linear code for any access structure. In this paper, we firstly construct the optimal linear codes for realizing any given non-threshold multi-access structures over finite field Fq. Then, based on our optimal linear code, we construct the optimal linear multi-secret sharing scheme for any non-threshold multi-access structure.	access structure;linear code;shamir's secret sharing	Shu-guang Dai;Chun-Ming Tang;Yue-nai Chen	2011		10.1145/2070425.2070435	systematic code;polynomial code;constant-weight code;low-density parity-check code;universal code;cryptography;information security;theoretical computer science;linear code;dual code;finite field	Theory	39.35011596844147	55.56576124830619	80641

Recently, Guo et al. [1], discovered a family of high rate locally correctable codes by considering lifting of multivariate polynomials. In this paper, we extend their method by lifting multivariate polynomials on curves, and generalize the “decoding on curve” algorithm from Reed-Muller codes to these lifted codes to provide correcting algorithms with success probability arbitrarily approaching 1. This gives a family of high rate locally correctable codes that is highly sound.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;cryptography;fault tolerance;lambda lifting;polynomial;reed–muller code;reed–solomon error correction;with high probability	Yeow Meng Chee;Liyasi Wu;Chaoping Xing	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2014.6875377	discrete mathematics;parity-check matrix;theoretical computer science;covering code;locally decodable code;mathematics;locally testable code;algorithm	Theory	40.992188316951435	56.23908641647258	80784

These codes resemble the interlaced self-orthogonal quasi-cyclic random-error-correcting codes constructed by Townsend and Weldon, but the interlacing depends on the parity-check equations used. These parity-check equations are based on difference triangles that were introduced by Robinson and Bernstein in connection with convolutional codes. A restriction on these codes is that the maximum error burst length allowable is a multiple of a subperiod n_o of the codes. It is shown that in many cases these codes have shorter length than the equivalent interlaced random-error-correcting quasi-cyclic codes.	burst error-correcting code;forward error correction;list decoding	David M.

In particular, we are interested in the case that t>1 (so that q is not prime), and the order /spl rho/ is at least q. As shown by Ding and Key, under these conditions, unless /spl rho/ is very large (i.e., /spl rho/>(m-1)(q-1)+p/sup t-1/-2), the code is not spanned by its minimum-weight words. Furthermore, there was no known characterization of words with small weight that span the code. In this correspondence, we characterize a set of words that span the code, and show that their weight is upper-bounded by q/sup /spl lceil/m(q-1)-/spl rho//q-q/p/spl rceil//, which is at most quadratic in the weight of the minimum-weight words.	emoticon;minimum-weight triangulation;reed–muller code	Tali Kaufman;Dana Ron	2005	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2005.856964	arithmetic;reed–muller code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;statistics	Theory	39.87468119649188	52.95747035073638	81401

Both papers fail to acknowledge a previous work by Chen, dating back to 1969, which includes an analysis of even, length binary cyclic codes. Results from Chen’s study are presented. Index Terms -Binary cyclic codes of even length. In [l] and [2], the so called repeated-root cyclic codes have been analyzed. However, both papers have failed to mention C. L. Chen’s doctoral thesis [3]. In Section 3.6 of [3],’ entitled “Some Remarks on Cyclic Codes of Even Length,” binary cyclic codes of length 2n are analyzed. Specifically, the following theorem is proven. Theorem 1: Let g, (x) be a factor of the polynomial gl (x>, both over GF(2). For i = 1,2, let g , ( x ) generate an ( n , k , , d , ) cyclic code. Then the minimum distance, d , of the cyclic (2n, k ) code generated by g ( x ) = g l ( x ) g z ( x ) is given by d = 2 d 2 , if d , 2 2d2 d = d , , if d , I 2 d 2 . In the proof of Theorem 1, Chep indicates that the following matrix has a row space equivalent to that of the parity-check Manuscript received May 12, 1991.

Due to the potential applications of self-orthogonal rank metric codes, we focus on list decoding of them. In this paper, we prove that with high probability, an Fq-linear self-orthogonal rank metric code over Fn×m q of rate R = (1 − τ)(1 − n mτ) − is shown to be list decodable up to fractional radius τ ∈ (0, 1) and small ∈ (0, 1) with list size depending on τ and q at most Oτ,q( 1 ).

The 15 percent that deals with convolutional codes and with the connection between coding and modulation is, by contrast, shaky and sometimes inept. The revolutionary core of this book is the spectral theory of cyclic codes that occupies Chapters 8-11 and part of Chapter 13-a full third of the book. Much of this material is entirely new and all of it must be read and understood by any serious future researcher in algebraic coding theory. It establishes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) as the central tool in the study of cyclic codes. Although the relation of the DFT to cyclic codes was earlier recognized in varying degrees of explicitness by Reed and it is fair to say that Blahut was the first to appreciate the enormous untapped potential of the DFT in coding theory and he was certainly the pioneer in reconstructing (and enlarging) the theory of cyclic codes from the DFT standpoint [l]. In this view, a cyclic code is just the set of time-domain sequences whose spectra vanish over a specified set of frequencies. The coding engineer is forever liberated from the algebraic strait-jacket of ideals in polynomial rings, and algebraic coding theory is given a mighty shove toward its natural position among signal processing techniques. These chapters should be read as avidly by researchers in other branches of signal processing as by coding theorists. Not only does the DFT free coding theory from much arcane algebra, but coding theory frees the DFT from the strictures of the complex field. Blahut makes this point repeatedly: take your transforms or perform your convolutions in the most convenient field! There is much to admire in this part of the book. Helgert's alternant codes and the Goppa codes, both previously mysteries to this reviewer, are given eloquently simple formulations via the clever use of time-domain and frequency-domain """" templates """" combined with the convolution theorem for the DFT. Idempotents, too, arise to a new and simpler life in the frequency domain. And, of course, as is now generally well known from [l], the Reed-Solomon (RS) and BCH codes have beautiful frequency domain descriptions. All of this, and much more besides, can be found in Chapter 8. Chapter 9 deals with decoding from the DFT viewpoint, and includes Blahut's …"""	bch code;code (cryptography);coding theory;convolution;convolutional code;cyclic code;discrete fourier transform;error detection and correction;linear algebra;modulation;polynomial ring;reed–solomon error correction;signal processing	James L.

Using the Roos bound, the author proposes a lower bound, sometimes tight, for the minimum distance of the dual of an MB code. He describes the subclass of weakly self-dual extended MB codes and then characterizes some weakly self-dual extended BCH codes. Similarly, he proves that the nontrivial extended MB code over GF(4) is the smallest extended BCH code which is not an even code.

A picture transmission system of the present invention is adapted to code picture data by a variable sampling rate coding system to transmit the same. Picture data are stored in a frame memory (16) of a transmission area so that differential values between the same and predictors from a predictive circuit (43) are obtained by a subtracter (41) and compression-coded by a variable sampling rate compression circuit (42) to be transmitted. The compression-coded differential values are expansion-decoded by a variable sampling rate expansion circuit (40) so that original differential values are supplied to an adder (45). The adder (45) adds up the differential values with predictors, to produce predictors for subsequent sampling points. In a receiving area, transmitted codes are expansion-decoded by a variable sampling rate expansion circuit (51), so that the decoded values are added up with predictors from a predictive circuit (53) by an adder (52) to output the original picture data. Preposition prediction and variable sampling rate decoding are thus combined to enable, in the receiving area, automatic correction of compression/expansion errors caused in the transmission area.

Conditions are established under which the new method is superior to the concatenated scheme. For a fixed number of information bits, the total redundancy with the two methods is calculated and conditions are established under which the redundancy of the new method is smaller than the redundancy of the traditional method.

Conventional satellite-based techniques are able to detect long-term drifts only larger than 2 ns/day, and momentary receiver time deviations of the order of 100 ns can he expected with no practical improvement due to averaging unless extended to one day which precludes a medium-term analysis of local cesium performance. Bias-type errors, reliably found after a three-month test run and seriously hampering synchronization, with less costly user equipment show a typical offset of 200 ns. The generally applied test periods of 20 to 50 days, particularly for drift analysis, seem short since slow 10 ns to 20 ns fluctuations of the timing difference, lasting 20 days, are found. Many laboratories overlook environmental factors during long-term stability tests and thus unreliable results are produced. For a careful analysis of current commercial cesium clocks several colocated high-quality references are needed.	transponder timing	Pekka Eskelinen	1999	IEEE Trans.

First, they impart a great deal of algebraic structure to a subclass of the class of cyclic codes. Second, because they can be formulated in terms of much shorter (component) codes, their decoding may be considerably simpler than many other types of codes. In this paper both of the properties of cyclic product codes are developed. It is shown that the product of two majority-logic decodable cyclic codes is also majority-logic decodable provided that one of the component codes is one-step decodable. More precisely, if the row-component code can realize minimum distance d_1 (i.e., correct [(d_1 -- 1)/2] errors) with a one-step majority-logic decoder and if the column-component code can realize minimum distance d_2 with an L -step decoder, then the product code can realize distance d_1 d_2 with an L -step decoder. It is also shown that the algebraic structure of cyclic product codes can be applied to establish the exact minimum distance of certain subclasses of BCH codes.	code	Shu Lin;E. J.

This method utilizes the complement bits that are added to the original information bits, which can effectively reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals with random frame size N and the coding rate R /spl les/ (N - k)/N, where k is a positive integer and k /spl les/ N/2. The performance results obtained with CBC are given and compared with that of some well known schemes, such as simple block coding, modified simple block coding, simple odd parity code, and cyclic coding, for the same purpose. The results show that at the same coding rate 3/4, CBC can achieve almost the same performance as SBC and MSBC, but with lower complexity, and the same performance can be obtained with a higher coding rate using CBC. The PAPR reductions of CBC with coding rate (N - 1)/N are almost the same as with a coding rate less than (N - 1)/N, but almost the twice as these of SOPC when N /spl ges/ 16. Moreover, we can find that PAPR is the lowest for all block codes using CBC with coding rate 3/4. So modified CBC (MCBC) is also proposed and analyzed, combined with the subblock processing technique to make CBC effective for OFDM systems with large frame sizes. The flexibility in coding rate choice and low complexity make the proposed CBC more suitable for random frame size with high coding rate and can also provide error detection.

We refer to such sequences as good codes. The class of good codes includes turbo, low-density parity-check, and repeat-accumulate codes. We show that a sequence of codes is good when transmitted over a memoryless binary-symmetric channel (BSC) or an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel if and only if the slope of its spectrum is finite everywhere and its minimum Hamming distance goes to infinity with no requirement on its rate growth. The extension of these results to code ensembles in probabilistic terms follows in a direct manner. We also show that the sufficient condition holds for any binary-input memoryless channel.	additive white gaussian noise;binary code;binary symmetric channel;hamming distance;low-density parity-check code;utility functions on indivisible goods	Ruoheng Liu;Predrag Spasojevic;Emina Soljanin	2005	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2005.859294	block code;arithmetic;concatenated error correction code;additive white gaussian noise;binary code;turbo code;combinatorics;low-density parity-check code;online codes;fountain code;theoretical computer science;repetition code;serial concatenated convolutional codes;linear code;hamming code;expander code;mathematics;forward error correction;error floor;statistics	Theory	39.953492642318515	58.22373698482548	88922

If the component codes are linear, then the minimum distance is the same for all the points, although the kissing number may vary. In fact, while in the single level (L = 1) case it reduces to lattice Construction A, a multi-level Construction C is in general not a lattice. We show that the two-level (L = 2) case is special: a two-level Construction C satisfies Forney's definition for a geometrically uniform constellation. Specifically, every point sees the same configuration of neighbors, up to a reflection of the coordinates in which the lower level code is equal to 1. In contrast, for three levels and up (L ≥ 3), we construct examples where the distance spectrum varies between the points, hence the constellation is not geometrically uniform.	additive white gaussian noise;binary code;circuit complexity;forney algorithm;l (complexity);powerset construction;utility functions on indivisible goods	Maiara Francine Bollauf;Ram Zamir	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541552	block code;polynomial code;concatenated error correction code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;constant-weight code;low-density parity-check code;linear code;mathematics;geometry;group code	Theory	42.09835115439344	55.5626889670838	89044

It is theoretically explained how to use the derived properties for fast correlation attacks, whose objective is to recover the linear feedback shift-register initial states, and the conditions for their success are obtained. The analysis and computations conducted indicate that the attacks are feasible in the practical case of relatively short cascades composed of long shift registers.	correlation attack	Renato Menicocci;Jovan Dj.

In particular, there are only few cases that the cross correlation is three-valued. In this paper, new pairs of binary sequences with three cross correlation values are presented. These two sequences have different lengths: 22k - 1 and 3(2k - 1), respectively. We determine the cross correlation distribution between these two sequences. We also give the possible correlation values for the shift decimated sequences. The magnitude of cross correlation values is shown to be low. The techniques presented in this paper may be useful to handle other similar cases.	cross-correlation;decimation (signal processing)	Jinquan Luo	2016	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2016.2620432	arithmetic;database index;combinatorics;complementary sequences;mathematics;correlation function;correlation;communications system;statistics	DB	42.295236968497555	48.273017117028765	89968
07ce2140c7744011ec591e656e13570cbe51459e	convenient way for detecting check bits in hamming code		When the data is transmitted through the channel, error mostly occurs in data which can be detected and corrected at the receiver side by using Hamming code. This technique is used now days in Wireless communication, in deep space communication etc, e.g. Fixed wireless broadband with high error rate where there is need of correction not only detection in the data. In this coding scheme the detection of data depend on the check/parity bits, these bits play a vital role in hamming code because they locate the position where the error has been occurred. These check bits are inserted into the data at specified position at the transmitter side.. But for the correction of data at receiver side without any need of retransmission, we need to find the value of check bits. And to find theses bits we design a matrix which gives us the values of check bits (0.1) with the help of data bits. Normally these bits can be found by using Ex-Or gate[16]. In this paper I have found these bits using another logic that is AND-OR logic., for the sake of convenience and knowledge. When the data is received at the receiver side and suppose error is occurred than at the receiver side again we need to find the check bits by repeating the process at transmitter side. Than will compare the check bits at transmitter and receiver side using a new logic, that is AND-OR logic, which will locate the position of error. And the data can be recovered easily without need of retransmission of data.	cyclic redundancy check;hamming code	Rahat Ullah;Jahangir Khan;Shahid Latif;Inayat Ullah	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-26010-0_42	hamming weight;4b5b;constant-weight code;hamming distance;hamming bound;parity bit;cyclic code;linear code;hamming code;hamming(7,4)	Crypto	40.266359924422375	58.46542252487427	90812

We derive the exact weight enumerator of nonbinary accumulators and subsequently give the weight enumerators for WNRMA code ensembles. We formally prove that the symbol-wise minimum distance of WNRMA code ensembles asymptotically grows linearly with the block length when L≥3 and n≥2, and L=2 and n≥3, for all powers of primes q ≥3 considered, where q is the field size. Thus, WNRMA code ensembles are asymptotically good for these parameters.	accumulator (computing);block code;coefficient;concatenation;encoder;enumerator polynomial;generalized valence bond;repetition code	Alexandre Graell i Amat;Eirik Rosnes	2011	2011 Information Theory and Applications Workshop	10.1109/ITA.2011.5743575	hamming weight;closed-form expression;binary code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;spectral shape analysis;statistics	Theory	40.60886453556273	56.226100942668324	91038

A generalized method for implementing the cyclic groups is established based on a decomposed mapping approach. In order to obtain efficient implementation of cyclic groups, certain mapping relations and a proper binary encoding method are investigated. Furthermore, a new class of code, called the circulative code, is developed, and two methods for generating such a code are presented. Various modulo arithmetic units can then be easily designed through a unique formula and can also be machine implemented. The modulo arithmetic units using this design approach are usually simpler than those conventional ones.	binary file;modulo operation	Stephen S.

This so called Insertable B-Layer (IBL) will be constructed with 448 of the new FE-I4 chips to handle the readout of the about 12 million pixels provided by the sensors of this layer. The improved architecture and increased bandwidth of these new readout chips requires new off-detector electronics which were decided to be also backwards compatible to the existing system. Hence the VME card pair establishing the optical interface to front-end and data acquisition (BOC) and managing the data processing and calibration (ROD) have been redesigned for the IBL. In this thesis the redesign of the BOC card is motivated and presented. At first the ATLAS Experiment is described and the need to upgrade the Pixel Detector with a new layer is explained. As the readout chip architecture of the current system has flaws preventing its use for the IBL the new FE-I4 is introduced, and with a look at the current off-detector electronics the need for a redesign of it is justified. Starting with the conceptual planning, the redesign process of the BOC card is presented from hardand firmware development to testing of the first prototypes. The redesigned BOC is based on modern FPGA technology in conjunction with commercial off-the-shelf optical transceiver modules to provide an integration four times higher than the current system, including the flexibility to adjust to different use cases by simply changing the firmware.	atlas;backward compatibility;data acquisition;field-programmable gate array;firmware;large hadron collider;pixel;sensor;shutdown (computing);transceiver;vmebus	Nicolai Schroer	2012			electronic engineering;computer hardware;engineering;electrical engineering	Security	53.595471086313324	49.74013111418366	91863

This method, however, creates a certain number of small trapping sets, which degrade overall performances. In this letter, an improved construction of a class of (3, k) LDPC codes on rectangular lattices is presented. Relevant constraints are derived to eliminate small trapping sets to improve performance in the error floor region. The check matrices of the proposed codes are introduced into quasi-cyclic structures, where experimental investigation shows favorable error rate performance over AWGN channels.	additive white gaussian noise;cyclic redundancy check;error floor;girth (graph theory);low-density parity-check code;performance;qr code	Xiongfei Tao;Pan Liu;Zhuoming Feng;Zuoqi Hu	2014	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2364211	concatenated error correction code;turbo code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;theoretical computer science;mathematics;error floor	Vision	41.671885177178595	59.51815700538083	93230

Additionally the expanded CCC-based 2D codes are also considered. In contrast to the conventional QCC-based 1-D and QCC-based FH/TS 2-D optical codes, our analysis indicates that the code capacity of the CCC-based 1-D and CCC-based FH/TS 2-D codes can be improved with the same code weight and length, respectively.	code;congruence of squares;cubic function;frequency-hopping spread spectrum	Chongfu Zhang;Kun Qiu;Yu Xiang;Hua Xiao	2011	IEICE Transactions		polynomial code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;constant-weight code;theoretical computer science;cyclic code;linear code;mathematics	HPC	40.55933313953352	54.2400716825419	93759

A given code has many encoder realizations and the information bit error probability is a function of this realization. Our goal here is to seek the optimal realization of encoding functions by taking advantage of the structure of the codes, and to derive the probability of information bit error when possible. We derive some sufficient conditions for a binary cyclic code to have systematic optimal generator matrices under bounded distance decoding and determine many cyclic codes with such properties. We also present some binary cyclic codes whose optimal generator matrices are non-systematic under complete decoding.

We have incorporated certain ideas already present in the literature into an axiomatic treatment of error-correcting codes. The usual “coordinates” are functions defined on a set of messages, with values in a given set  K  (classically,  K  = 0, 1). These functions are required to satisfy a certain “Coding Axiom”. In Section II we treat linear codes,  K  now being a finite ring; and we also give a treatment of cyclic codes, where we prove that the minimum distance is at least  n/k , where  n  is the block length and  k  the dimension. In Section III we prove our main result, the Mapping Theorem, which relates the weights in a code  A  to those in an image-code  B ; image-codes are defined simply in our terms. A number of corollaries are noted, including a formula for the sum of the squares of the weights of all code elements.		Edward F. Assmus;Harold F.

Since the Gold family for r odd is optimal with respect to the Welch bound restricted to binary sequences, Family d is thus superior to the best possible binary design of the same family size. Unlike the Gold design, Families d and ! t ? are asymptotically optimal whether r is odd or even. Both families are suitable for achieving code-division multiple-access and are easily implemented using shift registers. The exact distribution of correlation values is given for both families.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;irreducibility;irreducible polynomial;shift register;welch's method;z4 (computer)	Serdar Boztas;Roger Hammons;P.

The reciprocal of the time period in which the transmitter can send a single code symbol is called the transmission velocity. Since, at every moment, the restored length cannot be longer than the source length, the decoding rate is one at most. In this manuscript, we derive a transmission velocity at which the decoding rate is one almost surely with sequential codes.	arithmetic coding;code word;encoder;transmitter;velocity (software development)	Mikihiko Nishiara	2011	2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop	10.1109/ITW.2011.6089505	block code;arithmetic;list decoding;concatenated error correction code;prefix code;constant-weight code;low-density parity-check code;sequential decoding;parity-check matrix;variable-length code;self-synchronizing code;theoretical computer science;cyclic code;serial concatenated convolutional codes;linear code;mathematics;error floor;algorithm	Crypto	39.38934872528512	60.42168619601285	96161

Although the HIPERLAN defines a slowly time-varying multi-path fading-channel system, the Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) problem is still very severe since its data rate is up to 23.5 Mbps. An Adaptive Decision Feedback Equalizer (ADFE) is selected to overcome this problem, however, the FIR filters of the ADFE require high hardware cost for complex-number computation. In this work, we select the sequential architecture to reduce the hardware cost. The penalty of adopting the sequential architecture is that several internal clocks with a much higher operating frequency (235 MHz) and the corresponding high-speed components are required. In order to generate internal clocks, we embed an All Digital Phase-Locked Loop (ADPLL) in this chip. Meanwhile, the design of high speed multipliers and adders are achieved based on the combination of PTL, CPL, and CPL-TG CMOS logic circuits. Finally, our ADFE chip is designed in a 3.3 V 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS technology with only 3/spl times/2.8-mm/sup 2/ core area and 1 W power dissipation.	adaptive equalizer;equalization (communications)	Jinn-Shyan Wang;Pei-Lung Lin;Wern-Ho Sheen;Duo Sheng;Yu-Ming Huang	2000		10.1109/ISCAS.2000.856312	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;finite impulse response	Robotics	53.176105250149845	57.80784512151638	98595

An adaptive filter based on the delayed error least mean square algorithm is used to cancel echo. The external noise is eliminated and the clean speech is estimated by using the Kalman filter and the spectral subtraction technique. To be suitable for use in consumer electronics, we also design a high speed and flexible VLSI architecture of the adaptive filter for canceling echo. The architecture has hardware utilization efficiency of 100%, and we can easily scale the filter without reducing the throughput rate. The 0.6μm CMOS SPTM standard cells technology has been used to implement the chip. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Due to the complexity of the encoding process, but especially of the decoding process, most research on error correcting codes is restricted to binary data which are elements of the Galois field GF(2). Reed Solomon codes have been the most commonly used so far as non-binary (GF(q)) error correcting codes. Recently, low complexity decoding algorithms for non-binary LDPC and non-binary turbo-codes have been developed. In this paper, the design of convolutional codes over the non-binary Galois field, with cardinal 2^m (GF(2^m)), is presented in order to blind identify their parameters. An extension of our blind identification method dedicated to convolutional codes over GF(2) is developed for convolutional encoders over GF(2^m). Finally, the impact of Galois field parameters on the blind estimation of convolutional encoder parameters over GF(2^m) is investigated.	algorithm;binary data;convolutional code;encoder;error detection and correction;folded reed–solomon code;forward error correction;generator matrix;low-density parity-check code;primitive polynomial (field theory);relevance;turbo code	Yasamine Zrelli;Mélanie Marazin;Roland Gautier;Eric Rannou	2011	2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005780	turbo code;convolutional code;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;error floor;algorithm;statistics	Vision	41.303345458352744	59.28221796496433	100716

We apply our proposed formalism to the classical balanced incomplete block design (BIBD)-based row-circulant QC-LDPC codes for demonstrating that our designed codes outperform their dual-containing CSS-type counterparts as well as the entanglement-assisted (EA)-QLDPC codes.	cascading style sheets;circulant matrix;formal system;low-density parity-check code;parity bit;quantum entanglement;semantics (computer science);shor's algorithm	Zunaira Babar;Panagiotis Botsinis;Dimitrios Alanis;Soon Xin Ng;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2016	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2494020	block code;reed–muller code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;bismuth;tornado code;linear code;hamming code;expander code;luby transform code;mathematics;forward error correction;quantum convolutional code;cascading style sheets;raptor code;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;polynomial	Theory	41.74556462194512	58.341802978331536	100951

Although many similarities between both the cases have been established and proved in the literature, many other known results in the Hamming case, such as bounds or characterizations of weight-preserving maps, have not been translated to the rank case yet, or in some cases have been proved after developing a different machinery. The aim of this paper is to further relate both weights and generalized weights, show that the results and proofs in both cases are usually essentially the same, and see the significance of these similarities in network coding. Some of the new results in the rank case also have new consequences in the Hamming case.	hamming code;information leakage;linear network coding;map;secret sharing;spectral leakage;window function	Umberto Martínez-Peñas	2016	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2016.2570238	block code;hamming weight;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;constant-weight code;hamming distance;hamming bound;cryptography;theoretical computer science;cyclic code;hamming graph;linear code;hamming code;mathematics;forward error correction;hamming(7,4);statistics;coding theory	ML	39.5572570918356	55.52618010896973	101716

The proposed approach consists of minimizing a nonlinear objective function to produce a least-squares fit of the model equations to a set of measured device characteristics. All parameters are extracted using a combination of the direct-search optimization method and the variable metric algorithm. This makes it possible to obtain satisfactory results even in the presence of redundant parameters and poor initial values. A special strategy of calculating an objective function during optimization that requires very little CPU time is proposed. An example of parameter extraction of the SPICE 2 G.6 BJT model shows poor model accuracy. Therefore a model modification that gives a very good fit to the measured data is proposed. >		K.

In many cases efficient and practical decoding methods are produced. Codes with efficient decoding algorithms at maximal distances possible are derived from unit schemes. In particular unit-derived codes from Vandermonde or Fourier matrices are particularly commendable giving rise to mds codes of varying rates with practical and efficient decoding algorithms. For a given rate and given error correction capability, explicit codes with efficient error correcting algorithms are designed to these specifications. An explicit constructive proof with an efficient decoding algorithm is given for Shannon’s theorem. For a given finite field, codes are constructed which are ‘optimal’ for this field.	algorithm;code;coding theory;decoding methods;error detection and correction;maximal set;noisy-channel coding theorem;shannon (unit);shannon–hartley theorem	Ted Hurley;Donny Hurley	2018	IJICoT	10.1504/IJICOT.2018.10013082	fourier transform;combinatorics;error detection and correction;discrete mathematics;vandermonde matrix;finite field;matrix (mathematics);mathematics;decoding methods;constructive proof;coding theory	Theory	40.82569399209666	55.16009689683878	103102

Employing the well-known Pauli matrices which are very important in many subjects, several kind of block jacket matrices are constructed. Especially, construction and properties of the block jacket matrices with size 2n and 3n are investigated. Then a general approach for any size block jacket matrices is proposed. With novel properties of the block jacket matrices, a fast block inverse jacket transform is suggested.	algorithm;hadamard transform;mimo;quantum information;recursion;signal processing;transformation matrix;whole earth 'lectronic link	Guihua Zeng;Moon Ho Lee	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.446	arithmetic;error detection and correction;mobile telephony;computer science;signal processing;pure mathematics;mathematics;matrix decomposition;matrix;pauli matrices;algebra	Vision	41.58473285193491	54.96430381974421	103528

In this paper, we explicitly describe the trace representations of the binary characteristic sequences (of period p) of all the cyclic difference sets D which are some union of cosets of eth powers He in Fp* (=Δ Fp\{0}) for e ≤ 12. For this, we define eth power residue sequences of period p, which include all the binary characteristic sequences mentioned above as special cases, and reduce the problem of determining their trace representations to that of determining the values of the generating polynomials of cosets of He in Fρ* at some primitive pth root of unity, and some properties of these values are investigated. Based on these properties, the trace representation and linear complexity not only of the characteristic sequences of all the known eth residue difference sets, but of all the sixth power residue sequences are determined. Furthermore, we have determined the linear complexity of a nonconstant eth power residue sequence for any e to be either p - 1 or p whenever (e, (p-1)/n) = 1, where n is the order of 2 mod p.	polynomial;root of unity	Zongduo Dai;Guang Gong;Hong-Yeop Song;Dingfeng Ye	2011	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2010.2103757	database index;hamming weight;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;autocorrelation;pseudorandom binary sequence;mathematics;minimal polynomial;finite field;correlation;difference set;statistics;polynomial;algebra	Theory	42.16354971089865	48.79523281281143	103697

800ef1994ff41ab912bff6dc958f9382640e7a05	paraunitary-based boolean generator for qam complementary sequences of length 2k		A Boolean generator for a large number of standard complementary QAM sequences of length $2^{K}$ is proposed. This Boolean generator is derived from the authors’ earlier paraunitary generator, which is based on matrix multiplications. Both generators are based on unitary matrices. In contrast to previous Boolean QAM algorithms which represent complementary sequences as a weighted sum, our algorithm has a multiplicative form. Any element of a sequence can be generated efficiently by indexing the entries of unitary matrices with the binary representation of the discrete time index (which is easily implemented as a binary counter). Our 1Qum (based on one QAM unitary matrix) and 2Qum (based on two QAM unitary matrices) algorithms generate generalized Case I – III sequences and generalized Case IV and V sequences, respectively, as specified by Liu et al. in 2013, in addition to many new 2Qum sequences. The ratio of the numbers of sequences that are generated by our new construction and the previous construction increases with the constellation size. For example, for a 1024-QAM sequence of length 1024, this ratio is 4.4. However, if we compare only 2Qum sequences to Case IV and V sequences, this ratio is 267.	complementary sequences	Srdjan Z.

This improvement, combined with the techniques of Ben-Haim and Litsyn, improves the rate versus distance bounds for LDPC codes in a significant subrange of relative distances.	binary code;block code;coset leader;linear programming;low-density parity-check code;nat friedman;parity bit	Eran Iceland;Alex Samorodnitsky	2015	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2015.2438716	block code;reed–muller code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;combinatorics;singleton bound;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;factor graph;linear code;hamming code;expander code;mathematics;forward error correction;error floor;group code;reed–solomon error correction;algebra	Theory	40.90332905274591	58.50615851952538	104924

Multierror-correcting codes with a relatively short block length are not practical, since a high code rate is a major concern. The notation of a (d,k)-constrained block code is discussed.

fc0747424e2d8a52bb27bb4fdcf11908479cf77b	low-latency phasor measurement using offset time reference and asymmetric dictionary		The realization of multifunction algorithms that, besides meeting present phasor measurement unit (PMU) standards, can support more demanding measurement environments such as complex distribution grids, is a challenging problem. Maximum reporting latency is perhaps one of the more restrictive requirements, and the significant difference between P-class and M-class latency limits is particularly hard to manage in a multipurpose/multifunction algorithm. In this work we present a comparatively simple approach to the problem, based on the use of a reference reporting time that is offset from the usual position at the center of the acquired sample record. We discuss the adaptation of an existing algorithm (fast- TFM) and analyze resulting performances. Our study shows that it is indeed possible to lower total latency significantly without adversely affecting accuracy, proving the feasibility of a viable, low-cost integrated P/M-class measuring device.	algorithm;dictionary;multi-function printer;performance;phasor;power management unit;requirement;whole earth 'lectronic link	Giada Giorgi;Claudio Narduzzi	2018	2018 IEEE 9th International Workshop on Applied Measurements for Power Systems (AMPS)	10.1109/AMPS.2018.8494840	control engineering;engineering;electric power system;latency (engineering);latency (engineering);offset (computer science);phasor measurement unit;phasor	Visualization	52.90888007741513	51.3296283554246	105397

Fig. 1 shows a decoder for the (11,6) shortened code derived from the (15,lO) 2-step decodable code. The 2-flat polynomials listed in the figure are in the null space of the (l&IO) code. The salient differences between the full-length decoder and the shortened decoder are the following. 1) l-step decoding is always possible, resulting in large hardware savings. 2) Error correction of the information digit currently being decoded is required before cyclically shifting the received codeword to decode the next digit.

Such a combination can be found in industrial communication where an application specific CRC is embedded in regular fieldbus communication with a parity mechanism. In a typical error detection analysis, usually only the CRC is considered for the determination of the residual error probability or the Hamming-Distance. The effect of the parity bits has not been exploited yet, since no methods for the calculation of the concatenation were at hand. The inclusion of the parity mechanism allows more realistic information about the quality of the error detection.	concatenation;cyclic redundancy check;embedded system;error detection and correction;fieldbus;hamming code;hamming distance;parity bit	Tina Mattes;Frank Schiller	2010	2010 IEEE 15th Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA 2010)	10.1109/ETFA.2010.5641212	cyclic redundancy check;hamming distance;error detection and correction;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;probability of error;parity bit;hamming code;neodymium;algorithm;encoding;statistics;polynomial	EDA	40.735350090332346	59.60258600118772	105642

d6f77ca933e79e90507dce5b61deda6f15f95cd0	cumulative-separable codes	minimum distance;cumulant;information theory	A t first Γ(L,G)-codes were introduced by V.D.Goppa [1] in 1970. These codes are a large and powerful class of error correcting codes. F.J. McWilliams and N.J. Sloane [2] defined these codes as the most important class of alternant codes. It is known that there are Γ(L,G)-codes that reach the Gilbert-Varshamov bound and that many Γ(L,G)-codes are placed in the Table of the best known codes [3]. It is noted also that Goppa codes are interesting for postquantum cryptography. There are four basic types of Γ(L,G)-codes: cyclic, separable, cumulative, and irreducible Goppa code s. In this paper we describe new type of Γ(L,G)-codes that we call cumulative-separable Goppa codes. We are motivated to study this class of Goppa codes, because, as it will be shown below, there are its subclasses that have improved estimati ons on minimum distance and dimension and that there exist codes of these subclasses that have parameters better than those f or codes from the Table of the best known codes [3]. This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we review briefly the definitions that we will use in the paper. In Section III we describe subclasses of cumulative-separabl e Γ(L,G)-codes with improved estimations on the dimension and minimum distance. In Section IV the relations between codes from different subclasses of cumulative-separable c od s are presented. In Sections V and VI theorems on estimations o f the dimension and minimum distance of considered subclasse s are presented.	binary goppa code;cryptography;existential quantification;forward error correction;gilbert–varshamov bound;irreducibility;qr code	Sergey Bezzateev;Natalia A.

The advantage of using permutations, i.e. their favourable symbol diversity properties, is preserved. Additionally, using sequences of permutations as codewords, code rates close to the optimum rate can be achieved. Firstly, the complete set of permutations is divided into subsets by using set partitioning. Binary data is then mapped to permutations from these subsets. These permutations, together with a parity permutation, will form the codeword. Two constructions will be presented: one capable of detecting and correcting substitution errors and the other capable of detecting and correcting either substitution or deletion errors.	algorithm;binary data;code rate;code word;concatenation;error detection and correction;insertion sort;r language;sensor	Reolyn Heymann;Jos H.

By definition, these codes are left ideals in a certain skew polynomial ring. Using that the skew polynomial ring is isomorphic to a matrix ring we can describe the algebraic parameters of the codes in a more accessible way. We show that the existence of such codes with given algebraic parameters can be reduced to the solvability of a modified rook problem. It is our strong belief that the rook problem is always solvable, and we present solutions in particular cases.	convolutional code;decision problem;linear algebra;polynomial ring	Heide Gluesing-Luerssen;Fai-Lung Tsang	2008	Adv. in Math. of Comm.	10.3934/amc.2008.2.55	block code;cyclic redundancy check;concatenated error correction code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;convolutional code;cyclic code;linear code;mathematics;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;statistics;algebra	Theory	41.288820049684205	53.45793944316854	107739

A notion of extremality for the euclidean weight is introduced. Their binary images under the Gray map are formally self-dual with even weights. Extended quadratic residue Z 4-codes are the main example of this family of codes. They are obtained by Hensel lifting of the classical binary quadratic residue codes. Their binary images have good parameters. With every type II Z 4-code is associated via construction A modulo 4 an even unimodular lattice (type II lattice). In dimension 32, we construct two unimodular lattices of norm 4 with an automorphism of order 31. One of them is the Barnes-Wall lattice BW32.	binary image;code;dual wavelet;enumerator polynomial;lambda lifting;modulo operation;quadratic residue;unimodular polynomial matrix;z4 (computer)	Alexis Bonnecaze;Patrick Solé;Christine Bachoc;Bernard Mourrain	1997	IEEE Trans.

The identifying codes can be applied, for example, to sensor networks. In this paper, we consider as sensors the set Z 2 where one sensor can check its neighbours within Euclidean distance r. We construct tolerant identifying codes in this network that are robust against some changes in the neighbourhood monitored by each sensor. We give bounds for the smallest density of a tolerant identifying code for general values of r. We also provide infinite families of values r with optimal such codes and study the case of small values of r.	code;euclidean distance;sensor	Ville Junnila;Tero Laihonen;Aline Parreau	2013	Networks	10.1002/net.21472	block code;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;wireless sensor network;information theory;theoretical computer science;euclidean distance;linear code;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	ML	39.31633937382922	54.806003943438014	108645

By exploring their structure, we determine the type of one generator quasi-cyclic codes over  R  and the size by giving a minimal spanning set. We also determine the rank and introduce a lower bound for the minimum distance of free quasi-cyclic codes over   R  . We include some examples of quasi-cyclic codes of various lengths over   R  . In particular, we obtain a family of 2-quasi-cyclic codes from cyclic codes over the ring     F    2    +  u    F    2    +  v    F    2    +  uv    F    2    .

A power of C may quickly fill the whole space. Our purpose is to answer the following question: does the square of a code typically fill the whole space? We give a positive answer, for codes of dimension k and length roughly (1/2)k2 or smaller. Moreover, the convergence speed is exponential if the difference k(k+1)/2-n is at least linear in k. The proof uses random coding and combinatorial arguments, together with algebraic tools involving the precise computation of the number of quadratic forms of a given rank, and the number of their zeros.	computation;linear algebra;linear code;time complexity	Ignacio Cascudo;Ronald Cramer;Diego Mirandola;Gilles Zémor	2015	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2015.2393251	block code;reed–muller code;concatenated error correction code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;linear code;expander code;mathematics;group code;algebra	Theory	40.744454495586986	55.228226234650116	111261

The sum-product algorithm (SPA) can be used to decode quantum LDPC codes; however, the decoding performance may be significantly decreased by the many four-cycles required by this type of quantum codes. All four-cycles can be eliminated using the entanglement-assisted formalism with maximally entangled states (ebits). The proposed entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting code based on Euclidean geometry outperform differently structured quantum codes. However, the large number of ebits required to construct the entanglement-assisted formalism is a substantial obstacle to practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel class of entanglement-assisted quantum LDPC codes constructed using classical Euclidean geometry LDPC codes. Notably, the new codes require one copy of the ebit. Furthermore, we propose a construction scheme for a corresponding zigzag matrix and show that the algebraic structure of the codes could easily be expanded. A large class of quantum codes with various code lengths and code rates can be constructed. Our methods significantly improve the possibility of practical implementation of quantum error-correcting codes. Simulation results show that the entanglement-assisted quantum LDPC codes described in this study perform very well over a depolarizing channel with iterative decoding based on the SPA and that these codes outperform other quantum codes based on Euclidean geometries.	belief propagation;error detection and correction;exabit;forward error correction;iterative method;linear algebra;low-density parity-check code;mathematical optimization;merkle–damgård construction;quantum depolarizing channel;quantum entanglement;quantum error correction;semantics (computer science);shor's algorithm;simulation	Cao Dong;Song Yaoliang	2013	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2013.000035	block code;reed–muller code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;online codes;sparse matrix;fountain code;sequential decoding;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;bcjr algorithm;tornado code;linear code;hamming code;expander code;luby transform code;mathematics;forward error correction;quantum convolutional code;raptor code;quantum entanglement;error floor;reed–solomon error correction	Theory	41.87026587965359	58.84723752649952	111435

The main advantage is that the construction of a class of (J,L) girth-eight QC-LDPC codes is transformed into a rather simple task, searching for J integers satisfying the so-called GCD constraint for L. Combining the new method with masking matrices, a class of type-1 QC-LDPC codes is presented with girth at least eight.

It can recover clock signals after two data transitions and endure long sequence of consecutive identical digits. Two Digital Phase Aligners (DPAs), triggered by rising or falling edges of input data, recover clock signals, which are then combined by a phase interpolator. This configuration reduces the RMS jitters of the recovered clock by 30% and doubles the maximum run length compared to a previously reported DPA CDR. A prototype chip is demonstrated with 0.18-μm CMOS technology. Measurement results show that the chip operates without any bit error for 1.25-Gb/s 231-1 PRBS with 200-ppm frequency offset and recovers clock and data after two clock cycles.	burst mode clock and data recovery	Chang-Kyung Seong;Seung-Woo Lee;Woo-Young Choi	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e91-b.5.1397	chip;clock;signal reconstruction;embedded system;jitter;asynchronous circuit;telecommunications;clock domain crossing;clock skew;computer science;data recovery;clock rate;signal processing;frequency offset;prototype;synchronous circuit;clock gating;burst switching;clock signal;packet switching;computer network;burst mode;cpu multiplier	EDA	52.83949990486899	54.95119116033676	113598

Based on this structure, a novel approach to multiple error burst correction using RS codes is proposed. For a model of phased error bursts, where each burst can affect one of the columns in a two-dimensional transmitted word, it is shown that the bursts can be corrected using a known multisequence shift-register synthesis algorithm. It is further shown that the resulting codes posses nearly optimal burst correction capability, under certain probability of decoding failure. Finally, low-complexity systematic encoding and syndrome computation algorithms for these codes are discussed. The proposed scheme may also find use in decoding of different coding schemes based on RS codes, such as product or concatenated codes.	code;reed–solomon error correction	Victor Yu.

The main aim of this article is to reduce the complexity of the algorithm obtained by the authors in a previous work taking advantage of the powerful decomposition theory for linear codes provided by the decomposition theory of representable matroids over finite fields. In this way we identify the codes that can be written as “gluing” of codes of shorter length. If this decomposition verifies certain properties then computing the set of codewords of minimal support in each code appearing in the decomposition is equivalent to computing the set of codewords of minimal support for the original code. Moreover, these computations are independent of each other, thus they can be carried out in parallel for each component, thereby not only obtaining a reduction of the complexity of the algorithm but also decreasing the time needed to process it.	graver basis	Irene Marquez Corbella;Edgar Martínez-Moro	2012	Mathematics in Computer Science	10.1007/s11786-012-0120-y	block code;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;linear code;mathematics;algorithm;algebra	Theory	40.78466719274133	50.653268438885675	115153

Finally, our generalized low-density (GLD) lattice is the intersection of the first and the second lattice. We restrict our construction in this paper to integer lattices. GLD lattices are the result of mixing classical lattice theory with modern coding theory.

Cyclic finite geometry LDPC codes are known to have large minimum distances and can provide good error performance with very low error-floors using iterative decoding based on belief propagation. Their cyclic structure allows them to be efficiently and systematically encoded with simple shift-registers in linear time with linear complexity. An obvious question is whether, besides cyclic finite geometry LDPC codes, there are other cyclic codes with large minimum distances that can be efficiently decoded iteratively using channel soft information. In this paper, we present one such class of cyclic codes. Codes in this class are two-step majority-logic decodable and they are also constructed based on finite geometries. Two iterative decoding algorithms are devised for this class of cyclic codes and they provide significant coding gain over the two-step majority-logic decoding of codes in this class.	algorithm;belief propagation;coding gain;cyclic code;incidence matrix;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;majority logic decoding;software propagation;time complexity	Xiang Lin;Qin Huang;Shu Lin	2010	2010 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)	10.1109/ITA.2010.5454113	block code;reed–muller code;list decoding;time complexity;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;online codes;bit error rate;fountain code;sequential decoding;computer science;theoretical computer science;cyclic code;serial concatenated convolutional codes;bcjr algorithm;tornado code;coding gain;linear code;expander code;luby transform code;mathematics;forward error correction;berlekamp–welch algorithm;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;encoding;statistics;polynomial;belief propagation	Theory	41.899818047003514	59.845008145937825	117343

For positive m, the m-covering radius of C is the least radius t such that every m-tuple of vectors is contained in at least one ball of radius t centered at some codeword. In this paper upper bounds are found for the multicovering radii of first order Reed-Muller codes. These bounds generalize the well-known Norse bounds for the classical covering radii of first order Reed-Muller codes. They are exact in some cases. These bounds are then used to prove the existence of secure families of keystreams against a general class of cryptanalytic attacks. This solves the open question that gave rise to the study of multicovering radii of codes.	box–muller transform;code word;cryptanalysis;qr code;reed–muller code;reed–solomon error correction;whole earth 'lectronic link	Iiro S.

This new paradigm is motivated by the limitations of the reading process in high density data storage systems. They studied error correction in this new paradigm, specifically, the relationship between the minimum Hamming distance of an error correcting code and the minimum pair distance, which is the minimum Hamming distance between symbol-pair vectors derived from codewords of the code. It was proved that for a linear cyclic code with minimum Hamming distance dH, the corresponding minimum pair distance is at least dH + 3. Our main contribution is proving that, for a given linear cyclic code with a minimum Hamming distance dH, the minimum pair distance is at least dH + [dH/2]. We also describe decoding algorithms, based upon bounded distance decoders for the cyclic code, whose pair-symbol error correcting capabilities reflects the larger minimum pair distance. In addition, we consider the case where a read channel output is a prescribed number, b >; 2, of consecutive symbols and provide some generalizations of our results. We note that the symbol-pair read channel problem is a special case of the sequence reconstruction problem that was introduced by Levenshtein.	algorithm;channel (communications);code word;computer data storage;cyclic code;error detection and correction;forward error correction;hamming distance;ibm notes;lester the unlikely;magnetic storage;programming paradigm;reconstruction conjecture;vii	Eitan Yaakobi;Jehoshua Bruck;Paul H.

ea3aaf5a4e42fee3c00bcea20ada44726f87dc23	rudin-shapiro-like polynomials with maximum asymptotic merit factor		Borwein and Mossinghoff investigated the Rudin-Shapirolike polynomials, which are infinite families of Littlewood polynomials, that is, polynomials whose coefficients are all in {−1, 1}. Each family of Rudin-Shapiro-like polynomials is obtained from a starting polynomial (which we call the seed) by a recursive construction. These polynomials can be regarded as binary sequences. Borwein and Mossinghoff showed that the asymptotic autocorrelation merit factor for any such family is at most 3, and found the seeds of length 40 or less that produce the maximum asymptotic merit factor of 3. The definition of Rudin-Shapirolike polynomials was generalized by Katz, Lee, and Trunov to include polynomials with arbitrary complex coefficients, with the sole condition that the seed polynomial must have a nonzero constant coefficient. They proved that the maximum asymptotic merit factor is also 3 for this larger class. Here we show that a family of such Rudin-Shapiro-like polynomials achieves asymptotic merit factor 3 if and only if the seed is the interleaving of a pair of Golay complementary sequences.	asymptote;autocorrelation;coefficient;complementary sequences;forward error correction;polynomial;recursion;shapiro polynomials	Daniel J.

ZDB functions have received much attention in recent years due to its important applications in coding theory and sequence design. One objective of this paper is to present a construction of ZDB functions based on a kind of generalized cyclotomy. It generates ZDB functions over cyclic group with new parameters which can not be produced by earlier constructions. Another objective of this paper is to employ these ZDB functions to obtain at the same time: 1) optimal constant-composition codes; 2) perfect difference systems of sets; and 3) optimal frequency-hopping sequences, all with new parameters.	code;coding theory;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;nonlinear system;root of unity;whole earth 'lectronic link	Han Cai;Zhengchun Zhou;Xiaohu Tang;Ying Miao	2017	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2017.2675441	telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Theory	42.37354675249707	49.639033102465575	121497

In this paper, the problem is circumvented by building lookup tables (LUTs) and quantizing the inputs to approach approximate Euclidean projections at low computational complexities. To challenge the huge memory cost of LUTs, we first propose two commutative compositions of Euclidean projection and self-map, and show the existence of a small quantization range which does not alter the Euclidean projection. Then, we investigate the design and simplification of the LUTs by exploiting the commutative compositions and check node decomposition techniques. An efficient algorithm for the LUT-based projection is demonstrated by using one simplification method. Simulation results show that for both the regular and irregular LDPC codes, the ADMM decoding using LUT-based projection can substantially reduce the decoding time while maintaining the error rate performance at a comparatively large memory cost.	approximation algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;computational complexity theory;emoticon;fixed-point arithmetic;level of detail;linear programming decoding;lookup table;low-density parity-check code;qr code;quantization (signal processing);reduction (complexity);scheduling (computing);self-organizing map;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Xiaopeng Jiao;Jianjun Mu;Yucheng He;Chao Chen	2017	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2659733	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;sequential decoding;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;computational complexity theory;error floor	ML	41.61837977603758	60.44063881379568	123273

Solar radiation is thus a promising means of satisfying future energy demands. Space Power Satellites (SPSs) were demonstrated forty years ago, but only recently has this approach become feasible. A fully optical SPS eliminates the need for heavy, low efficiency photovoltaic cells as the first stage, so more energy can be obtained using very small and light structures. In this paper, the design of an SPS system is investigated. In addition, the effect of the turbulent atmospheric channel is examined.	ibm 1401 symbolic programming system;radiation hardening;spss;solar cell;turbulence	Afshin Jooshesh;T.

This is an example of the problem of constructing codes in irregular subsets of Hamming spaces. The authors examine the theoretical restrictions on the parameters of error-correcting codes in the asymptotic case (semi-finite sequence) when the recursive digital sum is upper-bounded by some small constant. The bounds allow demonstration of the existence of long codes that have good error-correcting properties and that satisfy some restrictions that are natural for optical and magnetic recording. >	code;error detection and correction;forward error correction	Gérard D.

The maximum error correcting radius coincides with the error correcting radius of the Sudan algorithm published in 1997. However, unlike the Sudan Algorithm, the approach described here is not a list decoding algorithm, and is not based on polynomial interpolation. The algorithm in this paper is rather syndrome based, like classical algebraic decoding algorithms. The computational complexity of the new algorithm is of the same order as the complexity of the well-known Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. To decode errors beyond half the minimum distance, the new decoder is allowed to fail for some high-weight error patterns with a very small probability.	berlekamp–massey algorithm;computational complexity theory;decoding methods;folded reed–solomon code;list decoding;polynomial interpolation;shift register;whole earth 'lectronic link	Georg Schmidt;Vladimir Sidorenko;Martin Bossert	2010	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2010.2060130	arithmetic;list decoding;combinatorics;sequential decoding;bcjr algorithm;mathematics;shift register;berlekamp–welch algorithm;error floor;algorithm;statistics	Theory	42.6384127188499	60.289109765061234	125235

Different error detection strategies (e.g. shortened hamming codes), which have been adopted as international standards, were analyzed. A setup is presented, which is based on a classification of error patterns in blocks by error-length and error-weight. This approach is used to determine the probability of an error pattern being a valid codeword and consequently not detectable. For these investigations a digital channel model, whose characteristics were found by analyzing real shortwave channel connections, was used. As a result of the investigation it is shown, that generator polynomials of the same code rate on channels with memory are the more efficiently the more equidistantly the exponents in the generator polynomial are distributed.	hamming code	Christoph Lange;Andreas Ahrens	2001		10.1007/3-540-45325-3_2	error detection and correction;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;probability of error;cyclic code;internal standard;hamming code;mathematics;coding;error exponent;algorithm;statistics;data transmission	Theory	39.72652747163501	58.83155268015665	125317

The approach is well suited when the filter order is fixed and not changed for particular applications, and efficient trade-off between power savings and filter performance can be made using the proposed architecture. Generally, FIR filter has large amplitude variations in input data and coefficients. Considering the amplitude of both the filter coefficients and inputs, the proposed FIR filter dynamically changes the filter order. Mathematical analysis on power savings and filter performance degradation and its experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves significant power savings without seriously compromising the filter performance. The power savings is up to 41.9% with minor performance degradation, and the area overhead of the proposed scheme is less than 5.3% compared to the conventional approach.	coefficient;elegant degradation;finite impulse response;overhead (computing)	Seok-Jae Lee;Ji-Woong Choi;Seon Wook Kim;Jongsun Park	2011	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2088142	adaptive filter;control engineering;electronic engineering;digital filter;voltage-controlled filter;kernel adaptive filter;engineering;finite impulse response;root-raised-cosine filter;control theory;electronic filter topology;filter design;active filter;half-band filter;m-derived filter	EDA	51.64744403826565	52.79746290081523	125580

J(lpve [IEEE IT, 41, jOg51 analyzed the average worst case probability of undetected error for linear [n, k; q] codes of length n and dimension k over an alphabet of si7,c q. The following sum 5 n = I:i:=:l (7Hi/n)i(li/n)n-i arose, which has also some other applkations in codlng theory, average case analysis of algorithms, and combinatorics. T. IG!ilve conjectured an asymptotic expansion of this sum, and we prove its enhcnced version in lms note. Furthermore, we consider a more challenging sum arising in the upper bound of the average worst case probability of undetected error over systematic codes derived by Massey. Namely: Sn,k = :L:i=1 (n;k)(ijn)i(l_ ijnt-i for k ::::: O. We obtain an asymptotic expansiDn of Sn,k, and this leads to a cDnclusion that Massey's bound Dn the average worst case probability over all systematic cDdes is better for every k than the cDrresponding Kl~ve's bDund over all codes [n, k; q].

In this paper, we construct new full-diversity STBCs with cubic shaping property and low ML decoding complexity via codes over $\mathbb{F}_4$ for number of transmit antennas $N=2^m$, $m>1$, and rates $R>1$ complex symbols per channel use. The new codes have the least ML decoding complexity among all known codes for a large set of $(N,R)$ pairs. The new full-rate codes of this paper $(R=N)$ are not only information-lossless and fully diverse but also have the least known ML decoding complexity in the literature. For $N \geq 4$, the new full-rate codes are the first instances of full-diversity, information-lossless STBCs with low ML decoding complexity. We also give a sufficient condition for STBCs obtainable from codes over $\mathbb{F}_4$ to have cubic shaping property, and a sufficient condition for any design to give rise to a full-diversity STBC when the symbols are encoded using rotated square QAM constellations.	channel use;code;cubic function;decoding methods;lossless compression;noise shaping	Natarajan Lakshmi Prasad;B.

Additionally, we also construct new families of almost MDS block and convolutional codes. Most of the new convolutional codes constructed here are unit-memory and have degree γ = 2. Moreover, based on a different method, we construct families of asymmetric quantum codes known in the literature.

In the class, every representation uses a self-delimiting representation of the integers as a variable length field of the exponent, and neither overflow nor underflow appears in practice. The adopted representations of the integers are defined systematically, so that representation's of numbers greater than one have both exponent-significant and integer-fraction interpretations. Since representation errors are characterized by the length function of an underlying representation of the integers, superior systems in precision can be easily selected from the proposed class. >	arithmetic underflow;delimiter	Hidetoshi Yokoo	1992	IEEE Trans.

3234ec01562c129e12fad32a9da7f5a70db7dab8	some aspects of a vector basis for a controllable group system, group code, and group shift		In a group trellis, the sequence of branches that split from the identity path and merge to the identity path form two normal chains. The Schreier refinement theorem can be applied to these two normal chains to obtain a Schreier series, a normal chain of the branch group B of the group trellis. It is shown that the components of the shortest length generator sequences of Forney and Trott form a complete system of coset representatives for the Schreier series decomposition of B. These components can be used to construct a natural time domain encoder with the form of a time convolution. The Schreier series and encoder have a natural shift structure related to B, and we find its graph automorphism group. Using the natural shift structure, we find a vector basis group for B which is isomorphic to B. When the basis is formed using generator sequences, the graph automorphism group gives a bound on the number of generator bases. Using the graph automorphism group, the encoder here is compared to an encoder of Forney and Trott. When B is abelian, there is a symmetry and duality between the two encoders which has a transform domain interpretation between a time and spectral domain. When B is nonabelian, the comparison shows that the components of the generator sequences must obey commutative restrictions, and so it is inherently difficult for a branch group to be nonabelian.	basis (linear algebra);convolution;encoder;forney algorithm;graph automorphism;group code;refinement (computing);trellis quantization	Kenneth M.

In fact, the length and dimension of the evaluation codes arising from a complete intersection are known. In this paper we will calculate the minimum distance of some evaluation codes associated to a subset of the projective space that is a complete intersection.

Unlike the 2 × 2 one that has only a single linear form, the 3×3 kernel matrix can take different forms, which needs more selectivity in the code construction. We thus give some design criteria to find the best G<sub>3</sub>, and then show how to construct and decode the polar code in detail. Encoding and decoding complexity are analyzed. It should be pointed out that, G<sub>3</sub> is the simplest case which can be used to illustrate the construction of a polar code among different choices of kernel matrices, and such idea can also be generalized to the construction of polar codes with other l.	generator matrix;gramian matrix;polar code (coding theory);selectivity (electronic)	Liang Zhang;Zhaoyang Zhang;Xianbin Wang	2012	2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542982	concatenated error correction code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;parity-check matrix;generator matrix;linear code;hamming code;mathematics;algebra	AI	40.11843226939166	56.7652428186934	131067

Given any integer $q$ power of a prime and any integer $n$ there is a family of MRD-codes of length $n$ over $\FF{q^n}$ having polynomial-time decoding algorithms. These codes can be seen as the analogs of Reed-Solomon codes (hereafter denoted RS-codes) for rank metric. In this paper their subspace subcodes are characterized. It is shown that hey are equivalent to MRD-codes constructed in the same way but with smaller parameters. A specific polynomial-time decoding algorithm is designed. Moreover, it is shown that the direct sum of subspace subcodes is equivalent to the direct product of MRD-codes with smaller parameters. This implies that the decoding procedure can correct errors of higher rank than the error-correcting capability. Finally it is shown that, for given parameters, subfield subcodes are completely characterized by elements of the general linear group ${GL}_n(\FF{q})$ of non-singular $q$-ary matrices of size $n$.	algorithm;code;error detection and correction;machine-readable dictionary;polynomial;reed–solomon error correction;time complexity;universal quantification	Ernst M.

We present two general construction methods: one based on permutation codes due to Datta and McLaughlin (1999), and the other, a nonbinary generalization of the binary enumeration methods of Patrovics and Immink (1996), and Gu and Fuja (1994). The construction based on permutation codes is simple and asymptotically (in block length) optimal, while the other construction is optimal in the sense that the resulting codes have the highest rate among all block-decodable codes for any block length. In the process, we shall also extend a result due to Zehavi and Wolf (1988) on the capacity of binary (d, k) constraints to M-ary channels. Finally, we present examples of template codes: remarkably low-complexity (M,d,k) block codes which achieve the optimal rate without the use of enumeration.	code	Suparna Datta;Steven W.

9eece784481e387572f64d0c7cb538d42eb6d122	hierarchical coding for distributed computing		Coding for distributed computing supports low-latency computation by relieving the burden of straggling workers. While most existing works assume a simple master-worker model, we consider a hierarchical computational structure consisting of groups of workers, motivated by the need to reflect the architectures of real-world distributed computing systems. In this work, we propose a hierarchical coding scheme for this model, as well as analyze its decoding cost and expected computation time. Specifically, we first provide upper and lower bounds on the expected computing time of the proposed scheme. We also show that our scheme enables efficient parallel decoding, thus reducing decoding costs by orders of magnitude over non-hierarchical schemes. When considering both decoding cost and computing time, the proposed hierarchical coding is shown to outperform existing schemes in many practical scenarios.	computation;distributed computing;markov chain;time complexity	Hyegyeong Park;Kangwook Lee;Jy-yong Sohn;Changho Suh;Jaekyun Moon	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2018.8437669	coding (social sciences);distributed computing;computation;computer science;decoding methods;upper and lower bounds	HPC	44.2883866698003	60.08190919645626	133115

The new aspects studied are: some properties and physical realization of encoders, considerations on convergence of decoding based on EXIT charts and the effect of the blocking factor on BER performance in AWGN channel.

They are widely used in wireless and cellular telephony. Spread spectrum techniques allow one to partition bandwidth, to hide transmissions, and to protect one's transmissions from being jammed. In this article, we develop two facets of spread spectrum. We show how to understand the properties of direct sequence spread spectrum. For this purpose we use probabilistic arguments. We also show how to design the pseudorandom sequences that spread spectrum transmitters and receivers generally use. This leads us to consider the properties of recurrence relations (and polynomials) over the integers modulo 2.

This bound is related to a second method for bounding the min imum distance of a cyclic code, which we call shifting. This method can be even stronger than the first one. For all binary cyclic codes of length < 63 (with two exceptions), we show that our methods yield the true min imum distance. The two exceptions at the end of our list are a code and its even-weight subcode. We treat several examples of cyclic codes of length 2 63.	bch code;cyclic code;maxima and minima	Jacobus H. van Lint;Richard M. Wilson	1986	IEEE Trans.

Finally, we report computational results based on turbo and low density parity check (LDPC) codes that demonstrate the effectiveness of our cuts. We demonstrate that our IP formulation and specific cuts are efficient tools for determining the minimum distance of moderate size linear block codes, specifically, they are very efficient for LDPC codes, and provide us with an additional tool for solving this important problem.	algorithm;block code;branch and cut;computation;convex hull;experiment;integer programming;linear code;linear programming relaxation;low-density parity-check code;np-hardness;parity bit;qr code	Ahmet B.

The resulting codes have no 4-cycle, i.e. cycles of length four and are defined by a small set of generators of codes with high rate and large code length. In particular, for LDPC codes with column weight three, we clarify the conditions on which they have no 6-cycle and their minimum distances are improved. Finally, we show the performance of the proposed codes with high rates and moderate lengths.	girth (graph theory);low-density parity-check code	Masaya Fujisawa;Shojiro Sakata	2007	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e90-a.5.1055	concatenated error correction code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;computer science;cyclic code;linear code;hamming code;mathematics;error floor;statistics;algebra	DB	40.32994049656008	53.94330559689113	139513

A review of all results concerning bounds on weight distributions of primitive binary BCH-codes is given in which it is stated that weights of long primitive binary BCH-codes are not binomially distributed. The weight distributions of some particular codes of the last two families are calculated and compared to the values of corresponding binomial distributions. Based on these results the family of binary doubly even self dual codes based on Hadamard matrices seems to be a good candidate to have binomially distributed weights for large code length, i. e., is a good candidate for an asymptotically optimal code family on the binary symmetric channel when decoded by a Maximum-Likelihood-Decoder with all codewords having equal prior probabilities.

This identification can be used to construct zero correlation zone (ZCZ) sequences directly and it also enables the construction of ZCZ sequences with special subsets.	first-order predicate;reed–muller code;reed–solomon error correction	Rathinakumar Appuswamy;Ajit Kumar Chaturvedi	2008	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2007.915980	arithmetic;reed–muller code;binary golay code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;complementary sequences;mathematics;ternary golay code;statistics	Visualization	41.58605246706862	55.052608498464444	141415

In addition to small bitline capacitance inherent to chain FeRAM architecture, three new FeRAM scaling techniques - octal bitline architecture, small parasitic capacitance sensing scheme, and dual metal plateline scheme - reduce bitline capacitance from 100 fF to 60 fF. As a result, a cell signal of ±220 mV is achieved even with the small cell size of 0.252 ¿m2. An 800 Mb/s/pin read/write bandwidth at 400 MHz clock is realized by installing SDRAM compatible DDR2 interface, and performance is verified by simulation. The internal power-line bounce noise due to 400 MHz clock operation is suppressed to less than 50 mV by an event-driven current driver, which supplies several hundreds of mA of current within 2 ns response. The precise timing and voltage controls are achieved by using the data stored in a compact FeRAM-fuse, which consists of extra FeRAM memory cells placed in edge of normal array instead of conventional laser fuse links. This configuration minimizes area penalty to 0.2% without cell signal degradation.	bounce message;cmos;cell signaling;elegant degradation;event-driven architecture;event-driven programming;ferroelectric ram;gigabyte;image scaling;mebibyte;megabyte;octal;simulation	Hidehiro Shiga;Daisaburo Takashima;Shinichiro Shiratake;Katsuhiko Hoya;Tadashi Miyakawa;Ryu Ogiwara;Ryo Fukuda;Ryosuke Takizawa;Kosuke Hatsuda;Fumiyoshi Matsuoka;Yasushi Nagadomi;Daisuke Hashimoto;Hisaaki Nishimura;Takeshi Hioka;Sumiko Doumae;Shoichi Shimizu;Mitsumo Kawano;Toyoki Taguchi	2010	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2009.2034414	embedded system;electronic engineering;non-volatile memory;computer hardware;computer science;operating system;computer performance	Arch	53.180888737685954	50.29218334075952	142821

6a89c81ce0ab0308f3de9f9522b263ee0b1ba244	decoding hermitian codes: an engineering approach		This thesis introduces and discusses a new algorithm for solving the key equation for Hermitian codes, that belong to the class of algebraic-geometric (AG) codes. First, the most important concepts of channel coding are recalled and the popular Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are used to illustrate them. The decoding of RS codes with the extended Euclidean algorithm is used to illustrate the basic idea of algebraic decoding and also to motivate the new decoding algorithm. After that, some elementary results from algebraic geometry are given: only those basics that are (directly or indirectly) used in the definition of AG codes are introduced. From the definition of general AG codes, RS codes and Hermitian codes are derived as special cases. An alternative definition of Hermitian codes that uses almost no algebraic geometry is also given. After the introduction of the codes, the key equation for Hermitian codes is presented. For a limited error weight, there is a unique solution of minimal degree to the key equation, and the error pattern can be reconstructed from this solution. An algorithm that finds this solution of minimal degree is given. Unfortunately, this algorithm is not capable of decoding all error patterns with weight up to half the minimum distance a bound up to which unique decoding is guaranteed by the properties of general linear codes that include Hermitian codes. An extension that achieves this decoding radius is discussed afterwards, and the complexity of both the algorithm and its extension are estimated. A modification of the algorithm that allows to find a basis for decoding beyond half the minimum distance is given in the last chapter. However, decoding up to this increased radius without (significantly) increasing the complexity is not always possible. A bound on the error weight that allows such decoding for interleaved Hermitian codes with high probability is derived, as well as the probability that decoding fails. Finally, the idea of virtual extension to an interleaved code is described. This principle works only for codes with low rates, and therefore the rate bound is given.	channel capacity;code;complexity;existential quantification;extended euclidean algorithm;forward error correction;linear algebra;reed–solomon error correction;with high probability	Sabine Kampf	2012				Theory	41.41025297962184	55.39095892581274	143684

The algorithm can be applied in decoding the QR codes with either reducible or irreducible generator polynomials. If the generator polynomial of the QR codes is reducible, the number of elements in the Galois field is less than the sum of all correctable error patterns. In other words, the mapping between elements of syndrome set and all correctable error patterns is not one to one. The key idea of decoding based on the mapping between the ordered q-tuples of the primary known syndrome and error patterns is one to one. In addition, the algorithm directly determines the error locations by lookup tables without the operations of multiplication over a finite field. According to the simulation result, the new lookup table decoding algorithm for the (31, 16, 7) QR code and the (73, 37, 13) QR code dramatically reduces the memory required by approximately 90 and 92%, respectively. Moreover, the high speed of decoding procedure could be utilised in modern communication system.	algorithm;irreducibility;lookup table;polynomial code;qr code;quadratic residue;simulation	Yan-Haw Chen;Trieu-Kien Truong	2011	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2010.0691	arithmetic;list decoding;lookup table;sequential decoding;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;berlekamp–welch algorithm;error floor;finite field;algorithm	Crypto	42.39205796464914	55.99222278122677	143816

The algorithm serves as a list decoder or as a probabilistic unique decoder and improves upon existing schemes, especially for high code rates. A probabilistic unique decoder with adjustable decoding radius is presented. The decoder outputs a unique solution with high probability and requires at most $$\mathcal {O}({s^2n^2})$$O(s2n2) operations in $$\mathbb {F}_{q^m}$$Fqm, where $$1\le s\le h$$1≤s≤h is a decoding parameter and $$n\le m$$n≤m is the length of the unfolded code over $$\mathbb {F}_{q^m}$$Fqm. An upper bound on the average list size of folded Gabidulin codes and on the decoding failure probability of the decoder is given. Applying the ideas to a list decoding algorithm by Mahdavifar and Vardy (List-decoding of subspace codes and rank-metric codes up to Singleton bound, ISIT 2012) improves the performance when used as probabilistic unique decoder and gives an upper bound on the failure probability.	code	Hannes Bartz;Vladimir Sidorenko	2017	Des.

Lately, capacitive-type touch-screens have been widely adopted in high-end mobile applications mainly because they offer multi- and soft-touch features together with higher durability and superior light transmittance over resistive-type touch-screens. Meanwhile, manufacturing costs have slowed down the adoption of this technology in low-end applications. Many display-module makers are trying to reduce system cost by merging the touch-screen panel (TSP) with the display panel [1]. At the same time, there is a desire for small-form-factor modules, which is driving an effort to reduce the number of components [2].

We assume that different positions j of the received binary vector y can be corrupted by the errors of varying weight Wj. The generalized Hamming distance between vector y and any binary vector c is then defined as the sum of weighted differences Wj|yj - Cj| taken over all n positions. We obtain a tight upper bound Lt on the number of codewords located within generalized Hamming distance T from vector y, and design a decoding algorithm that outputs this list of codewords with complexity O(n In2 Lt)- In particular, all possible error weights wj equal 1 if this combinatorial model is applied to a binary symmetric channel. In this case, the well known Green algorithm performs full maximum likelihood decoding of RM(1,m) and requires O(n ln2 n) bit operations, whereas the Litsyn-Shekhovtsov algorithm operates within the bounded-distance decoding radius n/4 - 1 with linear complexity O(n). We close the performance-complexity gap between the two algorithms. Namely, for any fixed epsi isin (0, frac12), our algorithm outputs the complete list of codewords within the decoding radius n(frac12 - epsi) with linear complexity of order n ln2 epsi.	algorithm;binary symmetric channel;bit array;code word;computational complexity theory;decision list;decoding methods;first-order predicate;first-order reduction;hamming distance;list decoding;reed–muller code;reed–solomon error correction;whole earth 'lectronic link	Ilya Dumer;Gregory A.

The design of a serial radix-16 processor is presented in which these algorithms are implemented for the low-cost AN code with A = 15.

For times long compared to the effective minority carrier lifetime, the usual current rectifier concept obtains. For times short compared to the lifetime, a charge rectifier is better able to explain experimental results; reverse recovery is evidence of this. Viewed in this way, semiconductor junctions are suitable for certain types of digital information processing. Voltage gain is limited only by junction breakdown and driver capability but charge (current) gain is inevitably less than one. The amount of charge run-down is shown to depend on the time the information is in the circuit. Scan generators, shift registers, serial memories, and serial converters have been studied as examples of the wide range of applications for which these devices are suitable.	rectifier	Thomas F.

Hence, for converting the received signal to baseband, the need of efficient high speed digital down converters arises. In [1] digital down conversion was identified as one of the ‘critical functionalities’ because it has to run at a relative high sample rate, and has to provide high resolution. The common approach for digital down conversion (DDC) is the so called ROM table approach where the samples of the input signal are multiplied with amplitude values of the sine- and cosine-function stored in ROM. To achieve high resolution this technique requires a large look-up table which means large chip area, high power consumption, lower speed, and increased costs. In this paper a CORDIC-based digital down converter is described. It enables to reduce the size of the look-up table considerably. Additionally to previous publications, this paper provides an overall worst case quantization error estimation that facilitates the dimensioning of the CORDIC-DDC.	baseband;best, worst and average case;cordic;coefficient;digital down converter;digital signal processing;image resolution;lookup table;quantization (signal processing);sampling (signal processing)	Michael Löhning;Tim Hentschel;Gerhard P.

Usually, the length of correlation window is shorter than the period of the chosen frequency hopping sequence, so the study of the partial Hamming correlation of frequency hopping sequence is particularly important. In this paper, the maximum partial Hamming correlation lower bounds of frequency hopping sequences with low hit zone, with respect to the size of the frequency slot set, the length of correlation window, the family size, the low hit zone, the maximum partial Hamming autocorrelation and the maximum partial Hamming crosscorrelation are established.

It is shown that the new time/frequency hopping sequences have at most one hit in their autocorrelation functions and at most two hits in their crosscorrelation functions except for a special case, and their family size is much larger than the conventional quadratic hopping sequences. The percentage of full collisions for the new quadratic hopping sequences is discussed. In addition, the average number of hits for the new quadratic hopping sequences, quadratic congruence sequences, extended quadratic congruence sequences and the general linear hopping sequences are also derived.	autocorrelation;code;congruence of squares;cross-correlation;cubic function;electron;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hamming weight;multi-user;polynomial;quadratic function;quadratic residue;radar;sonar (symantec);source-to-source compiler;ultra-wideband;whole earth 'lectronic link;window function	Huading Jia;Ding Yuan;Daiyuan Peng;Ling Guo	2008	Science in China Series F: Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-008-0136-8	arithmetic;code division multiple access;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;time–frequency analysis;autocorrelation;complementary sequences;mathematics;finite field;statistics	Crypto	42.06758544243693	48.67039593716677	148378

Berman showed in 1967 that cyclic codes and Reed Muller codes can be studied as ideals in a group algebra KG (over a finite field K and G is considered, in each case, a finite cyclic group and a 2-group respectively), several authors have investigated these codes. It has been observed, that the presence of additional algebraic structure make their study more effective. Following these ideas, we consider codes which are (graded) left ideals of a graded ring R or more generally, codes as (graded) left R-modules. In this paper, a linear code is graded if it is a graded R-module for some multiplicative group G and a G-graded K-algebra R. We will show that some important properties of graded codes can be obtained from their homogeneous components and then we generalize some results about codes as ideals in group algebras. In particular, we study cocyclic codes as ideals in a twisted group algebra, and more generally, in a crossed product.	byte;code (cryptography);cyclic code;existential quantification;kasparov's gambit;linear algebra;linear code;mathematical induction;qr code;reed–muller code;reed–solomon error correction;twisted	Justo Peralta;Blas Torrecillas	2002	Applicable Algebra in Engineering, Communication and Computing	10.1007/s002000200094		Theory	40.90930296075656	53.76717216379013	150345

Given a Euclidean geometry over a finite field of characteristic 2, base matrices in the Fourier transform domain are first constructed. Then the inverse Fourier transforms of these base matrices, combined with row and column permutations, result in low-density arrays of circulant permutation matrices and/or zero matrices. The null spaces of these low-density arrays give a family of QC-EG-LDPC codes. Codes in a special subclass have large minimum distances and their Tanner graphs contain no harmful trapping sets with sizes smaller than their minimum distances.	circulant matrix;code (cryptography);eurographics;fast fourier transform;kernel (linear algebra);low-density parity-check code;tanner graph	Qiuju Diao;Wei Zhou;Shu Lin;Khaled A.

Optimal codebooks meeting the Welch bound with equality are desirable in a number of areas. However, it is very difficult to construct such optimal codebooks. There have been a number of attempts to construct codebooks nearly meeting the Welch bound with equality, i.e., the maximal cross-correlation amplitude Imax(C) is slightly higher than the Welch bound equality, but asymptotically achieves it for large enough N. In this paper, using difference sets and the product of Abelian groups, we propose new constructions of codebooks nearly meeting the Welch bound with equality.

5a1683b5131445f56cb81b611a6dec94164d5124	finding characteristic polynomials with jump indices		Jansen introduced a technique for building LFSRs that can be clocked a large number of times with a single simple operation. These may be useful in the construction of stream ciphers based on clock-controlled LFSRs. However, for LFSR sizes of typical interest, it appears generally hard to find such jumping LFSRs with particular desired parameters. In this note we explain a trick which we used to find the jumping LFSRs in MICKEY and MICKEY-128, and which may be useful for future applications.	clock rate;linear-feedback shift register;mickey;stream cipher	Steve Babbage;Matthew Dodd	2006	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		jumping;discrete mathematics;polynomial;mathematics;stream cipher;difference polynomials;jump;linear feedback shift register	Crypto	41.99935586932947	46.488097741375725	151197

This paper explains how replacing rate-1/2 binary component codes by rate-m/(m+1) binary RSC codes can lead to better global performance. The encoding scheme can be designed so that decoding can be achieved closer to the theoretical limit, while showing better performance in the region of low error rates. These results are illustrated with some examples based on double-binary (m=2) 8-state and 16-state TCs, easily adaptable to a large range of data block sizes and coding rates.

fee4a87814b467800d58d6868f3e196070471ac0	constructing large girth qc protograph ldpc codes based on psd-peg algorithm		For a given base graph, the lifted graph can be obtained by a copy-and-permute procedure. If the permutation is cyclic, the lifted graph corresponds to a quasi-cyclic (QC) protograph low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. The girth of the QC protograph LDPC code is determined by the girth of the base graph and the permutation shifts. In this paper, we first derive a lower bound on the lifting degree to achieve a large girth lifted graph. Then, motivated by the cycle searching and girth maximizing features of the progressive edge-growth (PEG) algorithm, we introduce the permutation shifts determining (PSD) PEG algorithm, which can construct large girth base graph and determine the optimal permutation shifts, simultaneously. It is shown that the computational complexity of PSD-PEG algorithm is much lower than that of the PEG algorithm and the PEG-QC algorithm for the same codeword length. Furthermore, we show that the PSD-PEG algorithm can also be used to construct nonbinary QC protograph LDPC codes without low weight codes. Simulation results show that the binary and nonbinary QC protograph LDPC codes constructed by the PSD-PEG algorithm have good bit error rate performance and frame error rate performance over the additive white Gaussian noise channel.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;bit error rate;bitwise operation;code word;computational complexity theory;cyclic redundancy check;girth (graph theory);lifting scheme;low-density parity-check code;parsing expression grammar;selective calling;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Xueqin Jiang;Han Hai;Hui-Ming Wang;Moon Ho Lee	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2688701	permutation;code word;low-density parity-check code;discrete mathematics;computational complexity theory;additive white gaussian noise;bit error rate;algorithm;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;communication channel	Theory	42.60730272110657	60.12743595240249	154935

In this paper, let Fr be a finite field with r = q<sup>m</sup>. Suppose that g1, g2 ∈ F*<sub>r</sub> are not conjugates over F<sub>q</sub>, ord(g1) = n1, ord(g2) = n2, d = gcd(n1, n2), and n = n1n2/d. Let Fq(g1) = F<sub>q</sub>m<sub>1</sub> , Fq(g2) = Fqm<sub>2</sub> , and Ti denote the trace function from Fq<sup>m</sup><sub>i</sub> to Fq for i = 1, 2. We define a cyclic code C(q,m,n1,n2) = {c(a, b) : a ∈ F<sub>q</sub>m<sub>1</sub> , b ∈ F<sub>q</sub>m<sub>2</sub> }, where c(a, b) = (T<sub>1</sub>(ag<sup>0</sup><sub>1</sub>) + T<sub>2</sub>(bg<sup>0</sup><sub>2</sub>), T<sub>1</sub>(ag<sup>1</sup><sub>1</sub>) + T<sub>2</sub>(bg<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>), ... , T<sub>1</sub>(ag<sup>n-1</sup><sub>1</sub> ) + T<sub>2</sub>(bg<sup>n-1</sup><sub>2</sub> )). We mainly use Gauss periods to present the weight distribution of the cyclic code C(q,m,n1,n2). As applications, we determine the weight distribution of cyclic code C(q,m,qm<sub>1-1</sub>,qm<sub>2-1</sub>) with gcd(m1, m2) = 1; in particular, it is a three-weight cyclic code if gcd(q -1, m1 -m2) = 1. We also explicitly determine the weight distributions of some classes of cyclic codes including several classes of four-weight cyclic codes.	algorithm;code (cryptography);code word;cyclic code;emoticon;gauss–kronrod quadrature formula;linear code;weight function;window function	Chengju Li;Qin Yue;Fengwei Li	2014	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2014.2317785	arithmetic;nickel;hamming weight;discrete mathematics;food additive;mathematics;statistics;polynomial;algebra	DB	40.4665569339953	54.90814569841458	155679

Unfortunately, wireless signal attenuation and noise in this high frequency band is very sensitive to atmospheric conditions, such as temperature and humidity. Given that such atmospheric conditions at any given location could vary throughout the day, mobile communication systems seeking to exploit this band must expect some sort of diurnal variations in attenuation and noise. In this paper, we study the extent of diurnal variation in mmWave channels in three largest cities of Australia by accessing the hourly air quality and weather data over 12 months in 2015. We find that all planned mmWave bands, with the exception of 60 GHz, experiences significant diurnal variation in attenuation and noise. The attenuation and noise generally drops in the middle of the day when temperature rises and humidity falls, but remains high during the night. The diurnal variation is found to be more significant in summer compared to winter. The 60 GHz band remains stable throughout the day as this band is mainly affected by the amount of oxygen in the air, which does not fluctuate much for a given location.	frequency band	Seyed Amir Hosseini;Eisa Zarepour;Mahbub Hassan;Chun Tung Chou	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2016.7562105	telecommunications	Visualization	50.2939690946577	58.69929516180801	155761

A challenging hurdle in the theory of quantum error correction is that it is significantly more difficult to design error-correcting codes with desirable properties for quantum information processing than for traditional digital communications and computation. A typical obstacle to constructing a variety of strong quantum error-correcting codes is the complicated restrictions imposed on the structure of a code. Recently, promising solutions to this problem have been proposed in quantum information science, where in principle any binary linear code can be turned into a quantum error-correcting code by assuming a small number of reliable quantum bits. This paper studies how best to take advantage of these latest ideas to construct desirable quantum error-correcting codes of very high information rate. Our methods exploit structured high-rate low-density parity-check codes available in the classical domain and provide quantum analogues that inherit their characteristic low decoding complexity and high error correction performance even at moderate code lengths. Our approach to designing high-rate quantum error-correcting codes also allows for making direct use of other major syndrome decoding methods for linear codes, making it possible to deal with a situation where promising quantum analogues of low-density parity-check codes are difficult to find.	computation;decoding methods;error detection and correction;forward error correction;information processing;linear code;low-density parity-check code;quantum error correction;quantum information science;qubit	Yuichiro Fujiwara;Alexander Gruner;Peter Vandendriessche	2015	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2015.2398436	block code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;quantum information;low-density parity-check code;noise measurement;theoretical computer science;quantum network;quantum capacity;linear code;mathematics;quantum convolutional code;quantum computer;decoherence-free subspaces;quantum entanglement;error floor;quantum algorithm;quantum error correction	Theory	41.49192781541249	59.376621785140365	156250

In Section II, we propose a general formulation of parity check matrix for the desired code. We then derive necessary conditions for the code to have a minimum distance of 5. In Section III, we describe some new codes that satisfy the necessary conditions derived in Section II. In Section IV, we describe the construction of two additional new codes and make some remarks on the construction of long binary linear codes with a minimum distance of five.

INTR~DU~ION Binary linear codes with a minimum Hamming distance of five can be constructed from the well known BCH theory [l]-[3]. Let A be the minimum distance, r the number of check bits, and n the length of the code. For a given m, a primitive BCH code with d = 5, r = 2m, andn = 2” 1 can be constructed. More efficient codes can be constructed from nonprimitive cyclic codes. Let II = 2” + 1, let /3 be a primitive root of X” 1, and C Manuscript received June 12, 1990; revised March 5, 1991. The author is with the IBM Corporation, P.O. Box 950, Department D18, Building 707, Poughkeepsie, NY 12602. IEEE Log Number 9101398. the binary cyclic code of length II with 2m check bits, generated by the minimum polynomial of p. Then &I’: i = 1,2,2”-l, 2”-’ + 1,2” 1,2”f forms a subset of the roots of the generator polynomial of C. If m is even, the minimum distance of C is at least equal to 5 by HT bound [4]. If m is odd, let C’ be the code that consists of the set of all even weight codewords of C. Code C’ has 2m + 1 check bits and has a minimum distance d 2 6. The code can be punctured by deleting one of the check bits to yield a code of length 2” with 2m check bits and d 2 5. Thus, a binary cyclic code with n = 2m + 1 for m even, and n = 2” for m odd that has d 2 5 and r = 2m can always be constructed. These codes have one or two more information bits than the primitive BCH codes with the same number of check bits. Binary linear codes with d = 5 and an odd number of check bits can be constructed by shortening BCH codes. Let t be the weight of a minimum weight nonzero vector I’ of the dual code of a BCH code of length n with d = 5 and r = 2m. The subcode of the BCH code whose code words have zeros at the t positions corresponding to the ones of I/ has an effective codelength of n t with r = 2m 1 and d 2 5. Using this shortening technique, a binary linear code of minimum distance 5 with n = 2” +21(m+1)/21 -1 can be constructed [3], where lx] is the integer part of x. In this correspondence, we present another technique for constructing binary linear codes of minimum distance 5. A code with a minimum distance d, codelength n and the number of information bits k will be called an (n, k, d) code. Our approach is to extend the length of a known (n, k,5) code by adding one additional check bit. In some cases this construction yields codes that are equal to or better than the best previously known codes with d = 5. In particular, a (47,36,5) code is constructed that has 6 more information bits than the (41,30,5) code, which is the best code compiled in [5] with r = 11 and d = 5. We also construct (33,23,5) and (79,66,5> codes.] An (n, k, d) binary linear code is a k-dimensional subspace of an n-dimensional binary vector space [l]-[3]. The dimension r = r k of the null space of the code is the number of check bits. An (n, k, d) code can be specified by an r X n binary parity check matrix. The vector space formed by all possible combinations of the row vectors of the parity check matrix is the null space of the code, i.e., the dual code. In this correspondence, we specify a linear code by its parity check matrix. Let B and Q be two binary matrices with r rows and n1,n2 columns, respectively. We define a binary linear code C of ‘J. B. Shearer has obtained a (82,68,6) code among other efficient codes through a computer search [6].

Lower bounds on the minimum distance, stopping distance, and pseudodistance are derived for these codes using graph based analysis. These bounds are generalizations of Tanner’s bit-oriented and parity-oriented bound for simple LDPC codes. The new bounds are useful in predicting the performance of generalized LDPC codes under maximum-likelihood decoding, graphbased iterative decoding, and linear programming decoding, and rely on the connectivity of the Tanner graph.	amiga walker;binary erasure channel;code (cryptography);code word;decoding methods;error detection and correction;ibm notes;information theory;iterative method;linear programming decoding;lint (software);low-density parity-check code;michael sipser;richardson number;tanner graph	Christine A.

We shall see that if Pearl’s algorithm is applied to the “belief network” of a parallel concatenation of two or more codes, the turbo decoding algorithm immediately results. Unfortunately, however, this belief diagram has loops, and Pearl only proved that his algorithm works when there are no loops, so an explanation of the excellent experimental performance of turbo decoding is still lacking. However, we shall also show that Pearl’s algorithm can be used to routinely derive previously known iterative, but suboptimal, decoding algorithms for a number of other error-control systems, including Gallager’s low-density parity-check codes, serially concatenated codes, and product codes. Thus, belief propagation provides a very attractive general methodology for devising low-complexity iterative decoding algorithms for hybrid coded systems.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;bayesian network;belief propagation;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;control system;diagram;iteration;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;software propagation	Robert J.

In this paper, the proposed algorithm is applied to decoding classical convolutional codes, for instance, large constraint length $$Q$$Q and short decode frames $$N$$N. Other applications of the classical Viterbi algorithm where $$Q$$Q is large (e.g., speech processing) could experience significant speedup with the QVA. The QVA exploits the fact that the decoding trellis is similar to the butterfly diagram of the fast Fourier transform, with its corresponding fast quantum algorithm. The tensor-product structure of the butterfly diagram corresponds to a quantum superposition that we show can be efficiently prepared. The quantum speedup is possible because the performance of the QVA depends on the fanout (number of possible transitions from any given state in the hidden Markov model) which is in general much less than $$Q$$Q. The QVA constructs a superposition of states which correspond to all legal paths through the decoding lattice, with phase as a function of the probability of the path being taken given received data. A specialized amplitude amplification procedure is applied one or more times to recover a superposition where the most probable path has a high probability of being measured.	convolutional code;quantum algorithm;viterbi decoder	Jon R.

The most important property of OSD number representation systems is the possibility of performing carryfree addition and (by changing all the digit signs in the subtrahend) borrow-he subtraction. However, OSD number systems are not the only representations with this property. Previously, the author has defined the class of generalized signed-digit (GSD) number systems having the digit set {-a. -a + 1, ’ . . , /3 1, p} in radix T with o 2 0, /3 2 0, and a + 2 T . GSD number systems cover all useful redundant number representations as special cases. Most GSD number systems support carry-free addition and borrow-free subtraction and even those that do not, can be dealt with using limited-carry or limited-borrow algorithms which yield the ith sum or difference digit zE as a function of the digits I,, y,, ~ ~ 1 , yz-l, ~ ~ 2 , and yt-2 of the operands I and y. In this paper, we treat additional topics that are important for practical implementation of arithmetic functions using GSD number systems. Because GSD number systems may have asymmetric digit sets, we need to consider subtraction (or at least sign change for representations with cr > 0 and /3 > 0) explicitly. Zero detection, sign detection and overflow handling are also treated in depth.	algorithm;object storage;operand	Behrooz Parhami	1993	IEEE Trans.

Up to generalizations, the classical examples of such codes were constructed in the 1970s and are today known as Gabidulin codes. Motivated by several recent approaches to construct MRD codes that are inequivalent to Gabidulin codes, we study the equivalence issue for Gabidulin codes themselves. This shows in particular that the family of Gabidulin codes already contains a huge subset of MRD codes that are pairwise inequivalent, provided that $2\le m\le n-2$.	code;machine-readable dictionary	Kai-Uwe Schmidt;Yue Zhou	2017	CoRR		block code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;linear code;mathematics;algebra	NLP	39.45454327933089	53.58458110023112	160019

A cyclic (v, K, 1) difference family (cyclic (v, K, λ)-DF in short) is a family F = {B1, B2, ..., Bt} of t subsets of Zv, the residue ring of integers modulo v, K = {|Bi| : 1 ≤ i ≤ t}, such that the differences in F, ΔF = ∪B∈F ΔB cover each nonzero element of Zv exactly λ times, where for each B ∈ F, ΔB = {x - y : x, y ∈ B, x ≠ y}, and |dev Bi| = v, 1 ≤ i ≤ t, dev Bi = {Bi + g : g ∈ Zv}. A cyclic (v, W, 1, Q)-DF is defined to be a cyclic (v, W, 1)-DF with the property that the fraction of number of blocks of size wi is qi, 0 ≤ i ≤ p. In this paper, constructions for cyclic (v, {4, 6, 7}, 1, {1/3, 1/3, 1/3})-DFs for primes v ≡ 1 (mod 84), (v, {4, u}, 1, {1/2, 1/2})-DFs for primes v ≡ 1 (mod u(u-1) + 12), u ≡ 0, 1 (mod 3) > 4 are presented. New optimal (v, W, 1, Q)-OOCs for 2 ≤ |W| ≤ 4 are then obtained.

A word  y  is called a descendant of a set of  t  codewords  x  1 ,…, x   t   if  y   i  e{ x   i   1 ,…, x   i    t  } for all  i =1,…, n . A code is said to have the identifiable parent property if for any  n -word that is a descendant of at most  t  parents it is possible to identify at least one of them. We prove that for any  t   q −1 there exist sequences of such codes with asymptotically nonvanishing rate.		Alexander Barg;Gérard D. Cohen;Sylvia B. Encheva;Gregory A.

In this paper, a transmission time analysis for the above parallel asynchronous communication scheme is presented. It is proven that the average transmission time for a code word is a strictly increasing function of the weight of the code word and it approaches the worst transmission time possible when the weight goes to infinity. This implies that fast parallel asynchronous systems can be designed using low weight codes. This paper also analyzes the transmission time performances of the proximity detecting codes and gives some efficient low constant weight code designs.	asynchronous system;code word;constant-weight code;performance;sensor	Luca G.

In coding theory, one is also interested in the higher Hamming weights, to study the code performance. Yet, not many values of the higher Hamming weights are known for these codes, not even the second lowest weight (also known as the next-to-minimal weight) is completely determined. In this paper, we determine all the values of the next-to-minimal weight for the binary projective Reed-Muller codes, which we show to be equal to the next-to-minimal weight of Reed-Muller codes in most, but not all, cases.	code (cryptography);coding theory;hamming code;reed–muller code;reed–solomon error correction;window function	Cícero Carvalho;Victor G.

As in a product code, any symbol in a word of a Diamond code is checked by both component codes. However, the “code directions” for the component codes have been selected to minimize the memory that is required between successive decoding stages for the component codes. Diamond codes combine the error correcting power of a product code with the reduced memory requirements of the CIRC code, applied in the Compact disk system. We discuss encoding, decoding, and minimum distance properties of Diamond codes. Variations on the Diamond code construction are proposed that result in codes that are suited for use in rewritable block-oriented applications.	family computer disk system;forward error correction;requirement;universal product code	Constant P.

Separate ON and OFF layers represent the positive and negative outputs of two-phase quadrature Gabor-type filters, whose orientation and spatial-frequency tunings are electronically adjustable. To enable the construction of a multichip network to extract different orientations in parallel, the chip includes an address event representation (AER) transceiver that accepts and produces two-dimensional images that are rate encoded as spike trains. It also includes routing circuitry that facilitates point-to-point signal fan in and fan out. We present measured results from a 32/spl times/64 pixel prototype, which was fabricated in the TSMC0.25-/spl mu/m process on a 3.84 by 2.54 mm die. Quiescent power dissipation is 3 mW and is determined primarily by the spike activity on the AER bus. Settling times are on the order of a few milliseconds. In comparison with a two-layer network implementing the same filters, this network results in a more symmetric circuit design with lower quiescent power dissipation, albeit at the expense of twice as many transistors.	action potential;array data structure;artificial neural network;binocular disparity;cellular neural network;circuit design;electronic circuit;fan-in;fan-out;feedback;function model;in-phase and quadrature components;input/output;interaction;network architecture;neuron;nonlinear system;pixel;point-to-point protocol;prototype;rectifier;routing;selectivity (electronic);single-ended signaling;the spike (1997);transceiver;transistor;two-phase commit protocol	Thomas Y.

The binary images of these codes under the Gray map are nonlinear, but formally self-dual. The construction involves Hensel lifting of binary cyclic codes. Quaternary quadratic residue codes are obtained by Hensel lifting of the classical binary quadratic residue codes. Repeated Hensel lifting produces a universal code defined over the 2-adic integers. We investigate the connections between this universal code and the codes defined over Z/sub 4/, the composition of the automorphism group, and the structure of idempotents over Z/sub 4/. We also derive a square root bound on the minimum Lee weight, and explore the connections with the finite Fourier transform. Certain self-dual codes over Z/sub 4/ are shown to determine even unimodular lattices, including the extended quadratic residue code of length q+1, where q/spl equiv/-1(mod8) is a prime power. When q=23, the quaternary Golay code determines the Leech lattice in this way. This is perhaps the simplest construction for this remarkable lattice that is known. >	code;quadratic residue;unimodular polynomial matrix	Alexis Bonnecaze;Patrick Solé;A.

We show that for certain choices of parameters these codes have better list decoding properties than are known for other codes, and are provably better than Reed-Solomon codes. We further show that codes with strong list decoding properties are equivalent to slice extractors, a variant of extractors. We give an application of extractor codes to extracting many hardcore bits from a one-way function, using few auxiliary random bits. Finally, we show that explicit slice extractors for certain other parameters would yield optimal bipartite Ramsey graphs.	error detection and correction;folded reed–solomon code;list decoding;one-way function;randomness extractor	Amnon Ta-Shma;David Zuckerman	2001	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1145/380752.380800	block code;reed–muller code;list decoding;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;online codes;fountain code;sequential decoding;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;tornado code;linear code;hamming code;expander code;luby transform code;mathematics;raptor code;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;algorithm;polynomial	Theory	40.054753795553346	55.376465336485865	165542

We also derive the distribution of autocorrelation values they take on. The sequences satisfy constant-on-the-coset property, and we show that there are more than one characteristic phases with constant-on-the-coset property. Some other interesting properties of those sequences are presented. For the cases when the polynomial (z+1)/sup d/+z/sup d/+a cannot be transformed into the form z/sup 2/-c, we performed extensive computer search, and results are summarized.

This bound leads directly to an estimate for the minimum distance of Zg-linear trace codes. In this correspondence, an improved minimum-distance estimate is presented. First, McEliece’s result on the divisibility of the weights of binary cyclic codes is extended to 24 trace codes. The divisibility result is then combined with the techniques of Serre and of Moreno and Moreno to derive the improved minimum-distance estimate. The improved estimate is tight for the Kerdock code as well as for the Delsarte-Goethals codes.	code;time complexity	Tor Helleseth;P. Vijay Kumar;Oscar Moreno;Abhijit G. Shanbhag	1996	IEEE Trans.

By viewing the minimum Hamming weight as a certain minimum property of one-dimensional subcodes, a generalized notion of higher-dimensional Hamming weights is obtained. These weights characterize the code performance on the wire-tap channel of type II. Basic properties of generalized weights are derived, the values of these weights for well-known classes of codes are determined, and lower bounds on code parameters are obtained. Several open problems are also listed. >	code;window function	Victor K.-W. Wei	1991	IEEE Trans.

We start from previous approaches which unwrap a low-density parity-check (LDPC) block code into an RTI-LDPCC code, and we obtain a new method to design RTI-LDPCC codes with better performance and shorter constraint length. Differently from previous techniques, we start the design from an array LDPC block code. We show that, for codes with high rate, a performance gain and a reduction in the constraint length are achieved with respect to previous proposals. Additionally, an increase in the minimum distance is observed.	array data structure;block code;convolutional code;low-density parity-check code;run-time infrastructure (simulation);time-invariant system	Marco Baldi;Giovanni Cancellieri;Franco Chiaraluce	2014	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2013.120713.132177	block code;reed–muller code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;convolutional code;low-density parity-check code;online codes;fountain code;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;tornado code;linear code;hamming code;expander code;luby transform code;mathematics;forward error correction;raptor code;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;statistics	EDA	42.47377991255729	60.414100509402246	167641

573c8c24216bc79d2612d37ed74032d7e92df247	a potential theory of general spatially-coupled systems via a continuum approximation	coupled system;potential theory	This paper analyzes general spatially-coupled (SC) systems with multi-dimensional coupling. A continuum approximation is used to derive potential functions that character ize the performance of the SC systems. For any dimension of coupling , it is shown that, if the boundary of the SC systems is fixed to the unique stable solution that minimizes the potential over all stationary solutions, the systems can approach the opti mal performance as the number of coupled systems tends to infinit y. I. I NTRODUCTION Kudekar et al. [1] proved that spatial coupling can improve the belief-propagation (BP) performance of low-density pa ritycheck (LDPC) codes up to the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) performance. This phenomenon, called threshold saturation , has been observed in many other spatially-coupled (SC) systems, such as the MacKay-Neal and Hsu-Anastasopoulos codes [2], code-division multiple-access (CDMA) [3]–[5], compressed sensing [6], [7], and physical models [8]. Thus, threshold saturation via spatial coupling is believed to be a universal phenomenon. In order to prove the universality of threshold saturation, theoretical analyses have been performed for general SC systems with one-dimensional coupling [9]–[11]. The metho dologies are classified into those based on potential functions [9], [10] and on extrinsic information transfer (EXIT ) functions [11]. Potential functions were also used for the analysis of threshold saturation in [7], [8]. The potential based methodology has the advantage that the analysis of the BP performance is simplified. Yedla et al. [10] defined a potential function to specify the BP performance for gener al SC systems. However, they presented no derivation of the potential function. One purpose of this paper is to present a systematic derivation of the potential function. The derivation is based on the continuum approximation used in [4], [9]. The continuum approximation can be natural ly extended to the case of multi-dimensional coupling: The previous analysis for SC scalar systems with one-dimension al coupling is generalized to the case of SC vector systems with multi-dimensional coupling. Hereafter, general SC ve ctor systems with multi-dimensional coupling is simply referre d to as generalized SC (GSC) systems. Multi-dimensional coupli ng can provide robustness of convergence against burst errors . See [12] for the details. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (i) The potential function defined in [10] is system atically derived via the continuum approximation. (ii) Mul tidimensional coupling is shown to provide the same improvement of the BP performance as one-dimensional coupling. II. SYSTEM MODEL A. Notation For integersi and j (> i), [i : j] denotes the set {i, i + 1, . . . , j} of lattice points. The symbols δab, δ a, δ ab represent the Kronecker delta. As defined below, the state of a GSC system withK-dimensional coupling is represented by two N dimensional vector fields u(x, t) = {u(x, t) : a = 1, . . . , N} and v(x, t) = {va(x, t) : a = 1, . . . , N} on R × [0,∞). Roman alphabet is used for the indices of the elements of the vector fields, whereas Greek alphabet is for the spatial vect or x = {x : α = 1, . . . ,K}. The differential operators ∂/∂u and ∂/∂vb are abbreviated to∂a and ∂, respectively. The gradients{∂a : a = 1, . . . , N} and {∂ : a = 1, . . . , N} are denoted by∇ and∇̃, respectively. One the other hand, ∂/∂x represents the gradient {∂/∂x : α = 1, . . . ,K} for the spatial variables. Furthermore, the Einstein summation conventio n is used: When an index appears twice in a single term, the summation is taken over all values of the index. For example, uva = ∑N a=1 u va. B. Uncoupled System For two scalar fieldsF andG on R , let D ⊂ R and D̃ ⊂ R denote the images of the gradients ∇̃F and ∇G, respectively. The dimension N corresponds to the number of parameters required for describing asymptotic performanc e of the BP algorithm for a system with no coupling. We assume that asymptotic performance is characterized by the couple d density-evolution (DE) equations with respect to u(t) = {u(t) : a = 1, . . . , N} andv(t) = {va(t) : a = 1, . . . , N}, u(t+ 1) = ∇̃F (v(t)) ∈ D, (1) v(t) = ∇G(u(t)) ∈ D̃, (2) where the time indext corresponds to the number of iterations for the BP algorithm. The asymptotic performance in iteration t is assumed to be characterized by a deterministic scalar functionP (·) of the stateu(t) that starts from an appropriate initial state. Assumption 1. The two scalar fieldsF and G are thrice continuously differentiable oñ D andD, respectively. Let S ⊂ D and S̃ ⊂ D̃ denote the sets of first and second elements of all fixed-points (FPs)(u,v) for the DE equations (1) and (2), respectively. The Hesse matrix f(v) = ∂∂F (v) is non-singular for allv ∈ D̃0 = D̃\S̃, and the quadratic form yaybf (v) is bounded below for all {ya} ∈ D̃ and v ∈ D̃. On the other hand, the Hesse matrix gab(u) = ∂a∂bG(u) are positive (resp. non-negative) definite for u ∈ D0 = D\S (resp. u ∈ D). Examples that satisfy Assumption 1 are MN and HA codes [2] as well as LDPC codes [1] and CDMA [3]–[5]. Note that Assumption 1 is different from that in [10]: The positiv edefiniteness ofgab(u) is assumed in this paper, whereas the positivity of its elements is postulated in [10]. In order to investigate the convergence property of the stat e u(t), we define two potential functions, one of which was originally defined in [10]. They are equivalent to the so-cal led trial entropy for LDPC codes [10] and to the free energy for CDMA [4], characterizing the MAP performance. Definition 1 (Potential). Let D(u,v) denote the divergence D(u,v) = G(u) + F (v)− uva. (3) The potential functionV (u) is defined as V (u) = −D(u,∇G(u)). (4) On the other hand, the dual potential function Ṽ (v) is defined by Ṽ (v) = −D(∇̃F (v),v). (5) Assumption 2. The potential functions (4) and (5) are bounded below. Assumption 2 is a sufficient condition for guaranteeing the convergence of the state u(t) toward a FPu ast → ∞. The following proposition implies that the two potential funct ions have the same information about FPs. Proposition 1. The 2-tuple (u,v) is a FP of the DE equations (1) and (2) if and only if u (resp. v) is a stationary solution of the potential (4) (resp. (5)). Furtherm ore, V (u) = Ṽ (v) at any FP(u,v). Proof: Calculating the gradient of the potential (4) with (3) yields ∂aV (u) = gab(u){u b − ∂F (∇G(u))}. (6) Since the Hesse matrix {gab(u)} of G is non-singular except for the FPsu ∈ S, ∂aV (u) = 0 is equivalent to u ∗ = ∇̃F (v) with v = ∇G(u). Similarly, we find that ∂Ṽ (v) = 0 is equivalent to the condition that (u,v) is a FP. Furthermore, we have Ṽ (∇G(u)) = −D(∇̃F (∇G(u)),∇G(u)) = V (u), (7) P ot en tia l V (u )	algorithm;approximation;backpropagation;belief propagation;burst error;charge-coupled device;compressed sensing;constructor (object-oriented programming);coupling (computer programming);emitter-coupled logic;emoticon;floating-point unit;gsc bus;gradient;infinit;iteration;low-density parity-check code;oxford spelling;potential method;qr code;software propagation;stationary process;stationary state;triune continuum paradigm;universal turing machine;vergence	Keigo Takeuchi;Toshiyuki Tanaka;Kenta Kasai	2013	CoRR		mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;potential theory;mathematics	ML	42.56762706320075	56.389230607466146	168168

These FSSMs show a nonzero output for the all-zero input case. The state-transitions structure and the randomness of the output for the all-zero input response of these FSSMs are studied for different initial state conditions. A relationship is found between these two characteristics and the BER performance or, equivalently, the form of the extrinsic information transfer chart of the corresponding turbo code. It is found that FSSMs with responses of the form of long closed cycles, and good randomness properties of the corresponding output are the best options as constituent encoders of nonlinear turbo codes designed over GF(4). A coefficient called the random behaviour coefficient is defined, to provide a quantitative measure of the behaviour of these FSSMs as constituent encoders of a turbo code.	exit chart;nonlinear system;turbo code	Mónica C.

A decomposition of the trellis topology leads to a systematic construction of signal sets and generators for geometrically uniform trellis codes. An algorithm is proposed to construct geometrically uniform trellis codes, and examples show how to obtain large free distance trellis codes. This approach unifies the construction of convolutional codes over the binary field and trellis codes over the real field.	convolutional code;trellis quantization	Yannick Lévy;Daniel J.

The codes presented have more flexible dimensions and weight than the J-optimal families appearing in the literature. The constructions are based on certain pointsets in finite projective spaces of dimension k over GF (q) denoted PG(k, q). This finite geometries framework gives structure to the codes providing insight.

Abstract In this paper we develop a technique to extend any bound for the minimum distance of cyclic codes constructed from its defining sets (ds-bounds) to abelian (or multivariate) codes through the notion of B-apparent distance. We use this technique to improve the searching for new bounds for the minimum distance of abelian codes. We also study conditions for an abelian code to verify that its B-apparent distance reaches its (true) minimum distance. Then we construct some tables of such codes as an application.	cyclic code	José Joaquín Bernal;M.

We define two conjugate weight preserving Gray maps to the binary space and study the images of linear codes under these maps. This structure couches existing Gray maps, which are a foundational idea in codes over rings, in a unified structure and produces new infinite classes of rings with a Gray map. The existence of self-dual and formally self-dual codes is determined and the binary images of these codes are studied.	dual code;map;matrix multiplication	Steven T.

Measuring and evaluating the exposed electromagnetic radiation (EMR) levels have become more substantial for human health especially in city centers where base stations are used densely. Thus, in this study, EMR measurements were conducted in two stages in Samsun city center. First, EMR measurements were performed using PMM 8053 for the appointed locations and time periods. Second, drive test measurements were done for much wider region through SRM-3006. It is concluded from the measurements that the maximum measured total electric field strength (E) in the band between 100 kHz - 3 GHz is 7.32 V/m which is below the limits determined by ICNIRP. A detailed examination of band selective measurements demonstrate that the main EMR sources in Samsun city center are the base stations which use 900MHz, 1800MHz and 2100MHz frequency bands, and 2100MHz has the most contribution to total E with 70%. Furthermore, an empirical model that helps calculating the total E of medium through these three main EMR sources with 99% was proposed.	excalibur: morgana's revenge;frequency band	Çetin Kurnaz;Begum Korunur Engiz	2016	2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)	10.1109/TSP.2016.7760864	pollution;telecommunications;electric field;base station;physics;quantum mechanics	ML	50.94403745785342	58.48188424237592	173020

We propose to use HR-minimal as a representative of each equivalence class and count the number of HR-minimals of size m × n for m ≤ 3. Some properties and constructions of HR-minimals are investigated. HR-minimals with the largest weight on its second row are defined as Quasi-Hadamard matrices, which are very similar to Hadamard matrices in terms of the absolute correlations of pairs of rows, in the sense that they give a set of row vectors with “best possible orthogonality.” We report lots of exhaustive search results and open problems, one of which is equivalent to the Hadamard conjecture.	brute-force search;hadamard transform;turing completeness	Ki-Hyeon Park;Hong-Yeop Song	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513675	combinatorics;chromium;discrete mathematics;row equivalence;mathematics;equivalence relation;hadamard matrix;matrix equivalence;correlation;hadamard's inequality;hadamard's maximal determinant problem;encoding;algebra	Theory	40.19323725260483	54.76978667211054	173084

We provide an explicit algorithm for computing the solution of our problem, which in turn is directly related to computing the distance (performance) of an underlying quantum error correcting code. Computing the distance of a quantum code is a highly non-trivial problem and our method may be of use in the construction of better codes.	algorithm;code (cryptography);decoherence-free subspaces;forward error correction;map;quantum error correction	German Luna;Samuel Reid;Bianca De Sanctis;Vlad Gheorghiu	2014	Discrete Math., Alg. and Appl.	10.1142/S1793830914500542	block code;graph power;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;tanner graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;error detection and correction;fractional coloring;theoretical computer science;quantum capacity;edge coloring;graph coloring;linear code;mathematics;voltage graph;quantum convolutional code;graph state;decoherence-free subspaces;error floor;quantum algorithm	Theory	39.78662595079356	54.09052713177373	173234

Let d<sup>⊥</sup> denote the minimum Hamming distance of the dual code of C over GF(2<sup>n</sup>). Let ɛ : GF(2<sup>n</sup>) → {−1, 1}n be the component-wise mapping ɛ(v<inf>i</inf>) := (−1)<sup>vi</sup> , for v =(v<inf>1</inf>, v<inf>2</inf>, … , v<inf>n</inf>) ∈ GF(2<sup>n</sup>). Finally, for p ≪ n, let φ<inf>C</inf> be a p × n random matrix whose rows are obtained by mapping a uniformly drawn set of size p of the codewords of C under e. Recently, the authors have established that [3] for d<sup>⊥</sup> large enough and y := p/n ∈ (0, 1) fixed, as n → ∞ the empirical eigen-distribution of the Gram matrix of 1 over √n times φ<inf>C</inf> resembles that of a random i.i.d.

In this paper, we overview this result and discuss its implications on the design of frames for compressed sensing applications.	block code;code word;compressed sensing;dual code;eigen (c++ library);gramian matrix;hamming distance;linear code;rademacher complexity	Behtash Babadi;Vahid Tarokh	2010	2010 44th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)	10.1109/CISS.2010.5464847	block code;binary code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;hamming distance;sparse matrix;sensor;random matrix;mathematics;gramian matrix;dual code;compressed sensing;finite field;statistics;algebra	Theory	39.36374515668323	54.076792551746365	173918

Turbo codes and woven convolutional codes are two examples of such schemes. The component codes used in these schemes operate at rates close to or even above capacity where the free distance of a code is not relevant anymore and other distance properties have to be taken into account. This thesis consists of an introduction to convolutional coding followed by a collection of six papers. In Paper A, some general relations between error-correcting and the error-detecting capabilities of a linear code are given. Lower bounds on the detecting and correcting capabilities of a convolutional code for sparse sequences of errors and erasures, respectively, are derived and extended to sequences of error bursts and erasure bursts. Paper B deals with aspects of a minimal realization of an encoding matrix in rational canonical form. Based on this realization, a lower bound on the active distances is derived. A new class of maximum slope convolutional codes providing good performance in case of a very noisy channel is introduced. Paper C shows by several illustrative examples that the criterion used for optimization in Paper B, is, unfortunately or perhaps fortunately, not the only parameter that has to be taken into account. In some applications we require that some data is more reliable than other which leads to the concept of unequal error protection (UEP). UEP for convolutional codes is investigated in the Papers D?F. Some new tools for estimating the error-correcting capabilities for a specific input or output of a convolutional encoder, are introduced and studied in Paper D. This concept is further developed and applied to woven convolutional schemes in Paper E. Finally, simulation results in Paper F demonstrate that a communication system constructed according to these ideas indeed provides good unequal error-correcting performance for information symbols even if non-optimum encoders are used and iterative decoding is applied.

Conversely, we also prove that, with the appropriate assumptions on length and number of generators, every self-dual code over Fq [u]/(ut ) can be obtained in this manner. We use this construction to produce several optimal self-dual codes over the base field in a manner that generalizes the Lee weight. This construction is based on ideas presented by Han et al. (Bull Korean Math Soc, 49:135–143, 2012) and also by Lee and Kim (An efficient construction of self dual codes, 2012), not only generalizing it, but joining the two different cases from the original paper as special cases of one general construction.	dual code;han unification	Ruben Alfaro;K.

The original definition of these codes relies on a nonconstructive averaging argument. In this paper, it is first shown that in some cases, the codes can be constructed without using any averaging arguments. We then introduce an alternative construction of the codes, based on the union of a geometric Goppa code and its cosets. In some cases, the problem of explicitly describing the codes reduces to the problem of explicitly describing certain n elements of the relevant function field, where n is the code length. Moreover, the number of finite-field operations required to construct these n elements after the construction of the generator matrix of the geometric Goppa code is of the order of n/sup 3/.	averaging argument;generator matrix;goppa code;nonlinear system;printer (computing)	Yaron Shany	2004	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2004.836924	block code;erasure code;reed–muller code;concatenated error correction code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;information theory;cyclic code;linear code;hamming code;expander code;mathematics;goppa code;finite field;group code;reed–solomon error correction;statistics;set theory;algebra	Theory	40.75477970720786	55.16650278212109	175545

Moreover, he showed that the additive group of such a code has a strongly regular Cayley graph. Here we show that for any proper regular projective linear code C over a finite Frobenius ring with two integral nonzero homogeneous weights w1 < w2, there is a positive integer d, a divisor of the order of C, and positive integer u such that w1 = du and w2 = d(u+1). In doing so, we give a new proof of the known result that any proper regular projective two-weight code code yields a strongly regular graph.

A strongly regular graph with these parameters is a symmetric (45, 12, 3) design having a polarity with no absolute points. In this paper we examine the ternary codes obtained from the adjacency (resp. incidence) matrices of these graphs (resp. designs), and those of their corresponding derived and residual designs. Further, we give a generalization of a result of Harada and Tonchev on the construction of non-binary self-orthogonal codes from orbit matrices of block designs under an action of a fixed-point-free automorphism of prime order. Using the generalized result we present a complete classification of selforthogonal ternary codes of lengths 12, 13, 14, and 15, obtained from non-fixed parts of orbit matrices of symmetric (45, 12, 3) designs admitting an automorphism of order 3. Several of the codes obtained are optimal or near optimal for the given length and dimension. We show in addition that the dual codes of the strongly regular (45, 12, 3, 3) graphs admit majority logic decoding. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find the order-like bound on the minimum weights of these codes on algebraic curves, and we prove that this order-like bound is better than the Goppa bound. On norm-trace curves over the finite fields of characteristic 2, we explicitly determine the order-like bounds for one-point AG codes and two-point AG codes. Consequently, it turns out that the order-like bound for two-point AG codes on norm-trace curves is better than that of one-point codes on the same curves except for a few cases.	code	Boran Kim;Yoonjin Lee	2018	Finite Fields and Their Applications	10.1016/j.ffa.2018.06.005	combinatorics;mathematics;algebraic geometry;finite field;algebraic curve	Crypto	41.062502629077386	52.92848204477729	177343

The basic idea is to construct nonequivalent parity-check matrices via column permutations. Three types of iterative decoders are devised to take advantage of the code's automorphism group. In this paper we focus on cyclic LDPC codes defined by a circulant parity-check matrix and consider two known subgroups of the automorphism group of a cyclic code. For the large class of idempotent-based cyclic LDPC codes in the literature, we show that the two subgroups only provide equivalent parity-check matrices and thus cannot be harnessed for iterative decoding. Towards exploiting the automorphism group of a code, we propose a new class of cyclic LDPC codes based on pseudo-cyclic MDS codes with two information symbols, for which nonequivalent parity-check matrices are obtained. Simulation results show that for our constructed codes of short lengths, the automorphism group can significantly enhance the iterative decoding performance.	circulant matrix;code (cryptography);cyclic code;graph automorphism;idempotence;iteration;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;parity-check matrix;simulation	Chao Chen;Baoming Bai;Xinquan Yang;Li Li;Yang Yang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2013.032713.120050	block code;list decoding;concatenated error correction code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;sequential decoding;serial concatenated convolutional codes;linear code;mathematics;error floor;group code;algebra	DB	41.8804345369854	58.29372742065763	178227

The linear feedback shift registers are often used in the construction of De Bruijn sequences. For any given linear shift register, its cycle structure and adjacency graphs are features that must be investigated in the construction of the De Bruijn sequences by using the cycle-joining method. A class of linear feedback shift registers is discussed in this paper. The cycle structure of some linear feedback shift registers is derived. And the adjacency graphs are divided into two categories to analyze their structure in detail. Based on this kind of linear feedback shift registers combined with the cycle-joining method, a novel family of De Bruijn cycles is obtained. The number of the corresponding De Bruijn cycles produced is also proposed exactly.	computer;de bruijn graph;linear-feedback shift register;stream cipher	Xiaofang Wang;Linzhi Jiang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2854265	distributed computing;designtheory;discrete mathematics;computer science;cryptography;de bruijn sequence;shift register;adjacency list;graph;stream cipher	Vision	40.7564372366855	50.86569478179975	179577

Aperiodic Hamming correlation of FH sequences matters in real applications, while it received little attraction in the literature compared with periodic Hamming correlation. In this paper, an upper bound on the family size of FH sequences, with respect to the size of the frequency slot set, the sequence length, the maximum aperiodic Hamming correlation is established. Further, a construction of optimal FH sequence sets under aperiodic Hamming correlation from Reed-Solomon codes is presented, whose parameters meet the upper bound with equality. From generalized $m$ sequences (GM sequences) and generalized Gordon-Mills-Welch sequences (GGMW sequences), two classes of optimal FH sequence sets under aperiodic Hamming correlation are also presented, whose parameters meet the upper bound with equality.	frequency-hopping spread spectrum;window function	Xing Liu;Daiyuan Peng	2014	Adv. in Math. of Comm.	10.3934/amc.2014.8.359	hamming bound	Theory	42.06252086763151	49.514150205164974	180093

This result wasobtained for the toric code, from which the planar code is derived, and surpasses allother known codes restricted to 2d nearest-neighbor architectures by several orders ofmagnitude. We describe in detail an error correction procedure for the toric and planarcodes, which is based on polynomial-time graph matching techniques and is efficientlyimplementable as the classical feed-forward processing step in a real quantum computer.By applying one and two qubit depolarizing errors of equal probability p, we determinethe threshold error rates for the two codes (differing only in their boundary conditions)for both ideal and non-ideal syndrome extraction scenarios. We verify that the toriccode has an asymptotic threshold of pth = 15.5% under ideal syndrome extraction, and pth = 7.8×10-3 for the non-ideal case, in agreement with [1]. Simulations of the planarcode indicate that the threshold is close to that of the toric code.	code	David S. Wang;Austin G. Fowler;Ashley M. Stephens;Lloyd Christopher L.

In addition of having expanded and asymptotically optimal cardinality, these 2-D asynchronous optical codes can be partitioned into multiple tree structures of code subsets, in which code cardinality is a function of the (periodic) cross-correlation value assigned to the subset. The performance of these 2-D optical codes is analyzed and compared with that of the multilevel prime codes. Our results show that the unique partition property of the new optical codes supports a trade-off between code cardinality and performance for meeting different system requirements, such as user capacity and throughput. In addition, the multiple tree structures of the new codes potentially support applications that require rapid switching of many codewords, such as in O-CDMA-network gateway or in strategic environments where code obscurity is essential.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;code word;cross-correlation;folded reed–solomon code;gateway (telecommunications);requirement;security through obscurity;system requirements;throughput	Yen-Feng Li;Guu-chang Yang;Hou-Shou Chen;Wing C.

It is compact with lower power consumption when compared to traditional FPGA implementations. Although designed for use in the control unit of a medical robot with 34-axes and tight space and power constraints, it can be readily used in other applications. It is implemented in a 2P3M 0.5 mm CMOS process and consumes 4.82mW power with active area of 0.45mm. r 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It focuses on FSEs associated to joint source-channel integer arithmetic codes, which are uniquely decodable codes by design. An efficient method for computing the free distance of such codes using Dijkstra's algorithm is proposed. To facilitate the search for codes with good distance properties, FSEs are organized within a tree structure, which allows the use of efficient branch-and-prune techniques avoiding a search of the whole tree.	computation;dijkstra's algorithm;encoder;mathematical optimization;tree structure;variable-length code	Amadou Diallo;Claudio Weidmann;Michel Kieffer	2011	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2011.020411.090780	block code;reed–muller code;discrete mathematics;online codes;computer science;theoretical computer science;bcjr algorithm;linear code;expander code;luby transform code;mathematics;finite-state machine;algorithm;source code	Vision	39.39644015212322	58.074850521832516	181169

However, RS codes suffer from having a fixed length. In many applications where the length is static, the appropriate length can be obtained by an RS code by shortening or puncturing. Generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes are a generalization of RS codes, whose subfield-subcodes are extensively studied. In this paper we show that a particular class of GRS codes produces many subfield-subcodes with large dimension. An algorithm for searching through the codes is presented as well as a list of new codes obtained from this method.	algorithm;code (cryptography);folded reed–solomon code;puncturing;reed–solomon error correction	Fernando Hernando;Kyle Marshall;Michael E.

Small minimum distance tends to result in poor decoding performance at the error-floor region. 2) The row weights of parity-check matrices “should not be large”: The performance of the sum-product decoding algorithm at the water-fall region is degraded as the row weight increases. Recently, Kudekar et al. showed spatially-coupled (SC) LDPC codes exhibit capacity-achieving performance for classical channels. SC LDPC codes have both large row weight and capacity-achieving error-floor and water-fall performance. In this paper, we propose a new class of quantum LDPC codes based on spatially coupled quasi-cyclic LDPC codes. The performance outperforms that of quantum “non-coupled” quasi-cyclic LDPC codes.	algorithm;cascading style sheets;emitter-coupled logic;error detection and correction;error floor;experiment;low-density parity-check code;pollard's p − 1 algorithm;quantum error correction;requirement;tanner graph	Manabu Hagiwara;Kenta Kasai;Hideki Imai;Kohichi Sakaniwa	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2011.6034208	block code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;quantum information science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;mathematics;error floor;channel capacity;quantum error correction	Theory	41.541191714994206	59.503850601334996	182982

However, their performance is commonly limited by the transducers' frequency bandwidth and emission pattern. 3D-LOCUS is a new advanced acoustic LPS that claims subcentimeter accuracy even in turbulent environments. This is achieved through the use of broadband omnidirectional transducers, suitable design of emitted signals, proper calibration, and bidirectional emissions. This paper evaluates the 3D-LOCUS LPS by providing results in terms of some positioning metrics such as accuracy, resolution, and coverage, which show how it outperforms other state-of-the-art LPS prototypes. 3D-LOCUS operating in bidirectional mode minimizes environmental effects, such as temperature and airflows, attaining localization errors below 9 mm with a 90% confidence level, an RMS error below 7.4 mm, and 5 mm resolution in a localization volume of 2 times 2 times 0.4 m3.	acoustic cryptanalysis;approximation error;bandwidth (signal processing);code coverage;locus;lightweight portable security;performance evaluation;precise point positioning;transducer;turbulence	José Carlos Prieto;Antonio Ramón Jiménez;Jorge I.

In this paper, we present two new constructions of R-linear codes that contain a subcode associated with a simplex code over the ring R. The simplex codes are defined as the codes generated by a matrix having as columns the homogeneous coordinates of all points in some projective Hjelmslev geometry PHG(R k ). The first construction generalizes a recent result by Kiermaier and Zwanzger to codes of arbitrary dimension. We provide a geometric interpretation of their construction which is then extended to projective Hjelmslev spaces of arbitrary dimension. The second construction exploits the possibility of adding two non-free rows to the generator matrix of a linear code over R associated with a given point set. Though the construction works over both chain rings with four elements, the better codes are obtained for $${R=\mathbb{Z}_4}$$ .	code	Thomas Honold;Ivan N. Landjev	2013	Des.

The (8, 5) shortened cyclic codes have a variety of choices. We have generated about 30000 sample codes with different weight distributions. Let S/sub w/ denote the set of generated sample codes with minimum weight w. The largest minimum weight of sample codes is 8. Let A/sub w/ denote the number of codewords of weight w of a sample code. In S/sub 7/, the smallest of A/sub 7/ is 10 for 10 sample codes and the second smallest of A/sub 7/ is 11 for six sample codes. In S/sub 7/, the smallest of A/sub 8/ is 728 for a sample code and the second smallest of A/sub 8/ is 729 for a sample code. We have chosen two sample codes from each of S/sub 7/ and S/sub 8/ which have the smallest and the second smallest sums of A/sub w/ for 7/spl les/w/spl les/9 in S/sub 7/ and S/sub 8/, respectively. For the AWGN channel using BPSK signaling, we have made simulation to evaluate the decoding error probabilities by a soft-decision decoding based on ordered statistics for the chosen four sample codes at SNR 2.0 to 5.0. These error probabilities are considerably smaller than the optimum error probabilities for (64, 40) subcodes of (64, 42) Reed-Muller code.	binary image;code	Hitoshi Tokushige;Takaaki Tanoue;Tadao Kasami	2001		10.1109/GLOCOM.2001.965548	arithmetic;reed–muller code;combinatorics;binary image;information theory;phase-shift keying;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	41.421632284599326	60.209566399453976	185814

We show two kernelization algorithms for Hybridization Number, with kernel sizes 4 k ( 5 k ) t and 20 k 2 ( Δ + - 1 ) respectively, with t the number of input trees and Δ + their maximum outdegree. Experiments on simulated data demonstrate the practical relevance of our kernelization algorithms. In addition, we present an n f ( k ) t -time algorithm, with n = | X | and f some computable function of k.

Compared to the well-known 4D 16-state TCM scheme with a comparable bandwidth efficiency, these two-level codes provide greater immunity from both Gaussian and impulse noise, at the cost of a reasonably higher complexity and a longer decoding delay, on the order of a few hundred symbols. The authors also show how to cope with phase ambiguities of the constellation in these two-level codes.

In this paper, we construct two binary linear codes associated with multi-dimensional and m−multiple power Kloosterman sums (for any fixed m) over the finite field Fq. Here q is a power of two. The former codes are dual to a subcode of the binary hyper-Kloosterman code. Then we obtain two recursive formulas for the power moments of multi-dimensional Kloosterman sums and for the m-multiple power moments of Kloosterman sums in terms of the frequencies of weights in the respective codes. This is done via Pless power moment identity and yields, in the case of power moments of multi-dimensional Kloosterman sums, much simpler recursive formulas than those associated with finite special linear groups obtained previously.	code;hyper-heuristic;power of two;recursion (computer science)	Dae San Kim	2009	CoRR		algebra;mathematical analysis;number theory;discrete mathematics;special linear group;linear code;power of two;recursion;finite field;mathematics;binary number;kloosterman sum	Theory	41.90498694836493	51.08302869633505	186608

Reed-Solomon encoders based on these concepts and techniques often require substantially less hardware than even linear cyclic binary codes of comparable redundancy. A CODEWORD of a cyclic code is a sequence of characters which can be viewed as the coefficients of a polynomial n-1 c(x) = 2 c,x’. i=o The characters C,,, C,,-2, Cn-s,. . . , C,, Co are elements in a finite field. In this paper, we consider only fields of order 2”, where m m ight be any integer. A sequence of n characters is a codeword if and only if its corresponding polynomial, C(x), is a mu ltiple of the code’s generator polynomial, g(x). Let deg g(x) = n k. The common method of encoding a cyclic code is to regard q-,9 cn-2,* * * 9 C,-, as message characters, and to divide the polynomial	binary code;carrier-to-noise ratio;code word;coefficient;cyclic code;encoder;folded reed–solomon code;forward error correction;polynomial code;reed–solomon error correction	Elwyn R.

We show that the appropriate distance measure for code construction is the Ulam metric applied to equivalence classes of permutations, where each permutation class corresponds to a multipermutation. The paper includes a study of multipermutation codes in the Hamming metric, also known as constant composition codes, due to their use in constructing multipermutation codes in the Ulam metric. We derive bounds on the size of multipermutation codes in both the Ulam metric and the Hamming metric, compute their capacity, and present constructions for codes in the Ulam metric based on permutation interleaving, semi-Latin squares, and resolvable Steiner systems.	forward error correction;hamming distance;modulation;permutation pattern;qr code;semiconductor industry;steiner tree problem;turing completeness	Farzad Farnoud;Olgica Milenkovic	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2014.6875335	block code;reed–muller code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;hamming distance;cyclic code;serial concatenated convolutional codes;bcjr algorithm;linear code;hamming code;expander code;luby transform code;mathematics;forward error correction;hamming(7,4);raptor code;error floor;group code;algebra	Theory	39.99118481855586	55.02361760794804	188840

The solution to the initial vector and nearest distance problem is presented for all irreducible affine reflection groups of rank n ges 2, for varying stabilizer subgroups. We use a detailed analysis of the geometry of affine reflection groups to produce a decoding algorithm which is equivalent to the maximum-likelihood decoder, yet whose complexity depends only on the dimension of the vector space containing the codewords, and not on the number of codewords. We give several examples of the decoding algorithm, both to demonstrate its correctness and to show how, in small rank cases, it may be further streamlined by exploiting additional symmetries of the group.	algorithm;code word;correctness (computer science);decoding methods;irreducibility	Terasan Niyomsataya;Ali Miri;Monica Nevins	2008	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2007.911261	affine geometry;affine space;complex space;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;affine coordinate system;vector space;affine hull;affine transformation;mathematics;geometry;affine shape adaptation;affine combination;group theory;affine group	Theory	41.48473646526063	55.36435650511498	188910

The main interest of providing UEP with nonbinary LDPC codes is that future standards are likely to prefer nonbinary coding schemes because of their better robustness to the codeword length and the modulation size. However, the problem of giving UEP properties with nonbinary LDPC codes is much more difficult than with binary LDPC codes. We present a first attempt to solve this difficult problem, based on LDPC codes built on finite groups. The framework and the basis about group LDPC codes are first presented in details, and the framework is used to give examples of UEP nonbinary LDPC codes that actually achieve different UEP properties at the bit level while the symbol error properties are kept equally protected.	bit-level parallelism;code word;error detection and correction;group code;huffman coding;low-density parity-check code;modulation;qr code	Alban Goupil;David Declercq	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595386	block code;gaussian noise;additive white gaussian noise;turbo code;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;probability of error;serial concatenated convolutional codes;finite element method;tornado code;linear code;mathematics;error floor;encoding;statistics;robustness	Theory	40.91640592647203	59.544975132049416	189337

It is shown that such codes cannot have a Tanner graph representation with girth larger than 12, and a relatively mild necessary and sufficient condition for the code to have a girth of 6, 8,10, or 12 is derived. These results suggest that families of LDPC codes with such girth values are relatively easy to obtain and, consequently, additional parameters such as the minimum distance or the number of redundant check sums should be considered. To this end, a necessary condition for the codes investigated to reach their maximum possible minimum Hamming distance is proposed.	circulant matrix;low-density parity-check code	Marc P. C.

However, the protograph structure imposes undesirable fixed upper limits on important code parameters. In this paper, we show that the upper bound on the minimum Hamming distance of protograph-based QC codes can be improved by the careful application of a two-step lifting procedure applied to the protograph. The promised improvement is validated by constructing codes with minimum distance exceeding the upper bound for QC codes based on a particular protograph.	low-density parity-check code	David G. M.

For the proposed sequence set, both the cross-correlation function and the side lobe of the auto-correlation function are zero for phase shifts within the zero-correlation zone. The proposed sequence set can be generated from an arbitrary Hadamard matrix of order n and a set of 2n trigonometric-like function sequences of length 4n. The proposed construction can generate an optimal sequence set that satisfies, for a given zero-correlation zone and sequence period, the theoretical bound on the number of members. The peak factor of the proposed sequence set is equal to √2.	acoustic lobing;ambiguity function;autocorrelation;cross-correlation;medical ultrasound;pulse compression;simulation	Takafumi Hayashi;Takao Maeda;Shigeru Kanemoto;Shinya Matsufuji	2013	The Sixth International Workshop on Signal Design and Its Applications in Communications	10.1109/IWSDA.2013.6849065	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;maximum length sequence;pseudorandom binary sequence;mathematics;geometry	Vision	42.51469390797425	48.256661560013754	190729

Their weight distributions measure their error performance relative to several channels, and hence have been an interesting object of study for a long time. In this note, we provide a method to determine the weight distributions of q-ary irreducible cyclic codes of length n, where q is a prime power and n is a positive integer coprime to q. This method is more effective for irreducible cyclic codes of some special lengths. We also list some optimal irreducible cyclic codes, which attain the distance bounds given in Grassl's Table [Code Tables: Bounds on the parameters of various types of codes, http://www.codetables.de].	cyclic code;irreducibility	Anuradha Sharma;Amit Kumar Sharma	2014	Discrete Math., Alg. and Appl.	10.1142/S1793830914500414	block code;cyclic redundancy check;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;burst error-correcting code;cyclic code;linear code;hamming code;mathematics;algebra	Theory	40.22972707370506	53.43309035647374	191490

The CPEG algorithm uses an alternative edge establishment sequence to construct low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Irregular LDPC codes constructed using the CPEG algorithm have improved girth and approximate cycle extrinsic message degree (ACE) compared to existing PEG algorithms. We also analyze the minimum codeword weight, minimum stopping set weight, local girth, and local ACE distributions for codes in four very large ensembles of irregular LDPC codes. The code ensembles analyzed were constructed using standard PEG, ACE modified standard PEG, CPEG, and ACE modified CPEG algorithms. Modifications to improve the ACE in PEG LDPC codes, by Xiao and Banihashemi, were implemented in the `ACE modified' versions of the PEG algorithms. The ACE modified standard PEG algorithm constructed the code ensemble with the highest minimum codeword weight and minimum stopping set weight distributions, and the ACE modified CPEG algorithm constructed the code ensemble with the highest local girth and ACE distributions. Short block length irregular LDPC codes with good degree distributions which have higher minimum weights than have been published for similar LDPC codes were found in the four code ensembles.	ace;approximation algorithm;block code;code word;error floor;girth (graph theory);low-density parity-check code;minimum weight;parsing expression grammar;qr code;simulation	Umar-Faruk Abdu-Aguye;Marcel Ambroze;Martin Tomlinson	2016	2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)	10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593102	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	PL	41.91785145116378	59.59070688956321	191657

Typically, each stored data page is composed of an equal number of binary pixels in either a low-contrast (“off”) state or a high-contrast (“on”) state. By increasing the number of “off” pixels and decreasing the number of “on” pixels per page, there is an associated gain in VHM system storage capacity. When grayscale pixels are used, a further gain is possible by similarly controlling the fraction of pixels at each gray level. This paper introduces a constant-weight, nonbinary, shortened enumerative permutation modulation block code to produce pages that exploit the proposed capacity advantage. In addition to the code description, we present an encoder and a low-complexity maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder for the shortened permutation code. A proof verifies our claim of ML decoding. Applying this class of code to VHMs predicts a 49% increase in storage capacity when recording modulation coded 3-bit (eight gray level) pixels compared with a VHM using a binary signaling alphabet and equalprobable (unbiased) data.	block code;datasheet;decoding methods;encoder;grayscale;holographic data storage;holography;modulation;optical storage;pixel	Brian M.

Codes for computer applications should have ultra-fast encoding and decoding speed, parallel processing, self-correcting decoder circuits and uniform density for easy implementation. In this paper, a class of one-step majority decodable codes with the above mentioned features is presented. The basic code is constructed by using the incidence matrix of a balanced or partial-balanced incomplete block design for the non-identity matrix part of the parity check matrix in reduced echelon form. Many new codes have been derived and are of practical value. The codes in this paper are the most efficient of the one-step majority decodable variety. They are also the general class of difference set codes and orthogonal Latin square codes.	code;computer;secure digital	Mu Y.

Based on this notion, the structure of such LDPC codes can be analyzed using a geometric approach that illuminates important properties of their parity-check matrices. In this approach, trapping sets are represented by subgeometries of the geometry used to construct the code. Based on the incidence relations between lines and points in this geometry, the structure of trapping sets is investigated. On the other hand, it is shown that removing a subgeometry corresponding to a trapping set gives a punctured matrix which can be used as a parity-check matrix of an LDPC code. This relates trapping sets, represented by subgeometries, and punctured matrices, represented by the residual geometries. The null spaces of these punctured matrices are LDPC codes which inherit many of the good structural properties of the original code. Hence, new LDPC codes, with various lengths and rates, can be obtained by puncturing an LDPC code constructed based on a partial geometry. Furthermore, these punctured matrices and codes can be used in a two-phase decoding scheme to correct combinations of errors and erasures.	column (database);incidence matrix;kernel (linear algebra);low-density parity-check code;parity bit;parity-check matrix;puncturing;qr code;two-phase commit protocol	Qiuju Diao;Ying Yu Tai;Shu Lin;Khaled A.

In this paper, we reduce the number of possible exceptions to 4, namely v = 274, 358, 400, 526. Correspondingly, for all such v, our results establish the existence of a T(2, 7, v)-code or equivalently a perfect 5-deletion-correcting code with words of length 7 over an alphabet of size v, where all the coordinates must be different. In the process, we also reduce the possible exceptions for (v, 7, 2)-BIBDs to 2 cases, v = 274 and 358 (in addition to the non-existent (22, 7, 2)-BIBD).	block size (cryptography);code	R. Julian R.

Herein, we present solutions to some of these problems. In particular, we show that the smallest nonempty intersection of two perfect codes of length 2m -1 consists of two codewords, for all $m \ge 3$. We also provide a complete solution to the intersection number problem for Hamming codes. Furthermore, we prove that for $m \ge 3$, a perfect code of length 2m-1 -1 is embedded in a perfect code $\Bbb{C}$ of length 2m -1 if and only if ${\Bbb C}$ is not of full rank. This result implies the existence of distinct generalized Hamming weights for perfect codes, and we determine completely the generalized Hamming weights of all perfect codes that do not contain embedded full-rank perfect codes. We further explore the close ties between perfect codes and tilings: we prove that full-rank tilings of ${\Bbb F}_{2}^n$ exist for all $n \geq 14$ and show that the existence of full-rank tilings for other n is closely related to the existence of full-rank perfect codes with kernels of high dimension. We briefly survey the present state of knowledge on perfect binary codes and list several interesting and important open problems concerning perfect codes and tilings.	code;hamming bound	Tuvi Etzion;Alexander Vardy	1998	SIAM J.

Some known general (i.e., applicable to all linear codes) algorithms of minimum distance decoding use a certain set of codewords to successively improve the current decision. Important examples in this class are the minimal-vectors decoding [14] and zero-neighbours decoding [16]. These two methods have some common features that enable us to introduce a general gradient-like decoding algorithm. We formulate key properties of this decoding, which allows us to analyze known algorithms in this class in a simple and unified manner. Further, we show that under certain conditions, gradient-like algorithms must examine all zero neighbours, and therefore, the size of this set provides a lower bound on the complexity of algorithms in this class. This implies that general asymptotic improvements of the zero-neighbours decoding algorithm in the class of gradient-like methods are impossible. The second group of methods, information set decoding, is better studied and yields algorithms with best known asymptotic complexity. All known algorithms in this group can be viewed as modifications of coveting set decoding. Following [4], we introduce an algorithm that for long codes ensures the maximum likelihood performance and has the smallest known asymptotic complexity for any code rate R, 0 < R < 1.	algorithm;code rate;code word;computational complexity theory;decoding methods;gradient;hamming distance	Alexander Barg	1997		10.1007/3-540-63163-1_1	list decoding;concatenated error correction code;combinatorics;error detection and correction;sequential decoding;information theory;theoretical computer science;linear code;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;berlekamp–welch algorithm;algorithm;statistics	Theory	39.83132472838151	58.27915248676606	194989

We first review a fast version of the Chien search algorithm based on the decomposition of the error locator polynomial into a sum of multiples of affine polynomials. We then propose to combine it with modified analytical methods for solution of polynomials of small degree in radicals. We suggest, in particular, two efficient decompositions, whose combination with analytical algorithms yields a significant reduction in time-complexity, as proved by means of simulation.	bch code;chien search;hybrid algorithm;online locator service;polynomial;reed–solomon error correction;search algorithm;simulation;speedup;time complexity	Sergei V.

Recently, Rosati [4] constructed a unital (2-(q3 + 1, q + 1, 1) design, i.e. Steiner system S(2, q + 1, q3 + 1)) in each Hughes plane of order q2, and raised the question whether his unital coincided in case q = 3 with one of the four I had found earlier. This turns out not to be the case. Statistics for Rosati’s unital are: s[3:7] = (0, 1152, 552, 72, 15), not resolvable, uniquely embeddable in a projective plane of order nine, self-dual, automorphism group of order 48, point orbits of sizes 4 + 12 + 12, block orbits of sizes 3 + 6 + 6 + 24 + 24, the binary code spanned by the blocks has dimension 23 and the weight enumerator of its dual has coefficients al0 = 8, ui2 = 7, aI4 = 0. (Here si is the number of‘maximal (partial) spreads of size i; see also [l, 21.) Applying the process described in [l] to Rosati’s unital one finds 15 more unitals, so that as far as I know 154 nonisomorphic Steiner systems S(2, 4, 28) are known today, 12 of which embed in a projective plane.	binary code;coefficient;embedded system;enumerator polynomial;graph automorphism;image plane;steiner tree problem	Andries E.

When the code rate is less than 1/2, efficient algorithms are available for finding minimum distance using the concept of information sets. When the code rate is greater than 1/2, only one information set is available and efficiency suffers. In this paper, we investigate and propose a novel algorithm to find the minimum distance of linear block codes with the code rate greater than 1/2. We propose to reverse the roles of information set and parity set to get virtually another information set to improve the efficiency. This method is 67.7 times faster than the minimum distance algorithm implemented in MAGMA Computational Algebra System for a (80, 45) linear block code.	algorithm;approximation;block code;code rate;computation;computational complexity theory;computer algebra system;generator matrix;kernel (linear algebra);linear code;magma;np-hardness;neural coding;parity bit;zimmermann telegram	Raghunadh K.

The authors call a (n,m,t)-WOM code a scheme that allows t successive writings of m arbitrary bits (i.e., one message among 2/sup m/) on a WOM of size n. WOM codes have been studied from an information-theoretic viewpoint by J.K. Wolf et al. (1984) and constructed using classical coding theory by G.D. Cohen et al. (1986, 1987) (for example, with parameters, (23,11,3), (2/sup m-1/,m,2/sup m-2/+2/sup m-4/+1)). The authors adapt those methods in order to solve the problem raised by Rivest. Large classes of easily decodable single-error-correcting WOM codes are obtained. >	code	Gilles Zémor;Gérard D. Cohen	1991	IEEE Trans.

In this paper, we provide a theorem that establishes a necessary and sufficient condition that a q-ary matrix constructed by assigning non-zero elements from GF(q) to the 1s in the parity-check matrix of a binary quasi-cyclic LDPC code must satisfy in order for its null-space to define a non-binary quasi-cyclic LDPC (NB-QC-LDPC) code over GF(q). We then propose a general scheme for constructing NB-QC-LDPC codes along with some other code construction schemes that might serve better for different design goals. We also demonstrate that NB-QC-LDPC codes are very suitable for high-rate applications, e.g. applications in magnetic recording and storage systems and optical communication systems.	kernel (linear algebra);low-density parity-check code;magnetic storage;naive bayes classifier;parity-check matrix	Murat Arabaci;Ivan B.

Since then improvements have been made to Gallager’s construction method and some analytic constructions for LDPC codes have recently been presented. However analytically constructed LDPC codes comprise only a very small subset of possible codes and as a result LDPC codes are still, for the most part, constructed randomly. This paper extends the class of LDPC codes that can be systematically generated by presenting a construction method for regular LDPC codes based on combinatorial designs known as Kirkman triple systems. That is, we construct(3, ρ)-regular codes whose Tanner graph is free of 4-cycles for any integerρ.	low-density parity-check code;parity-check matrix;randomness	Sarah J. Johnson;Steven R.

Normally, an outer decoder using a Hamming single error correcting code cannot correct more than one error. But by using what is called soft information single error correction (SISEC) where a hypothesis that a particular symbol in some outer check set is the only error in the set can be confirmed or denied by the inner coder, a Hamming single error correcting code of any order can very easily correct, with high confidence, any pattern of two errors. In many cases > 2 errors can be corrected, up to a good fraction of even n-k errors of a (n,k) Hamming single error correcting code.	concatenated error correction code;concatenation;error detection and correction;forward error correction;hamming code	John J.

In particular, we consider codes derived from finite symplectic geometry assumed to have additional global symmetries. From this standpoint, the analogs of Calderbank–Shor–Steane codes and of GF(4)-linear codes turn out to be special cases of the same construction. This allows us to construct families of quantum codes from certain codes over number fields; in particular, we get analogs of quadratic residue codes, including a single-error-correcting code encoding one letter in five, for any alphabet size. We also consider the problem of fault-tolerant computation through such codes, generalizing ideas of Gottesman.	computation;error detection and correction;fault tolerance;forward error correction;gottesman–knill theorem;qr code;quadratic residue;shor's algorithm;symplectic integrator	Eric M.
