With the proliferation of computer technology in terms of computational ability as well as reliability, computers are being used for such digital signal processing purposes. As far as computer hardware is concerned, it has been growing steadily in terms of power and reliability. Since power plant technology is now globally switching over to such computer-based relaying, software reliability naturally emerges as an area of prime importance. Recently, some computer-based digital relay algorithms have been proposed based on frequency-domain analysis using wavelet-neuro-fuzzy techniques for transmission line faults. A software reliability allocation scheme is devised for the performance evaluation of a multi-functional, multi-user digital relay that does detection, classification and location of transmission line faults.	algorithm;computer hardware;digital signal processing;domain analysis;emergence;fault tree analysis;multi-user;neuro-fuzzy;performance evaluation;relay;software quality;software reliability testing;transmission line;wavelet	Diptendu Sinha Roy;Dusmanta Kumar Mohanta;A.

The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the filter output is considered as the performance measure of the system. The design problem is cast as a max-min optimization problem to robustify the system SINR with respect to the unknown Doppler shifts of the targets. To tackle the design problem, we devise a novel method to obtain optimized pairs of transmit sequence and receive filter sharing the desired robustness property.	interference (communication);mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;optimization problem;robustification;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Mohammad Mahdi Naghsh;Mojtaba Soltanalian;Petre Stoica;Mahmood Modarres-Hashemi;Antonio De Maio;Augusto Aubry	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853560	computer vision;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;root-raised-cosine filter;control theory;mathematics;filter design	Robotics	41.315990655382876	90.72328998896549	197034
