472737187d161d3baa0138f6bf0920e10cc53624	cardiac ultrasound multiview fusion using a multicamera tracking system	phantoms cameras echocardiography gelatin image fusion image registration image resolution medical image processing object detection;cuboid gelatin phantom cardiac ultrasound multiview fusion multicamera tracking system multiple three dimensional ultrasound scans three dimensional echocardiography heart geometry image quality transducer movements image registration object position tracking object orientation tracking image resolution dynamic heart phantom;ultrasonic imaging transducers tracking echocardiography heart phantoms image quality	This study presents a novel approach to fuse multiple three-dimensional ultrasound scans using a multi-camera tracking system. Recent advances in echocardiography allow real-time three-dimensional dynamic acquisition of the heart. However, one of the major limitations of the three-dimensional echocardiography is the limited field-of-view (FOV), which may lead to an acquisition insufficient to cover the whole geometry of the heart. Recently, methods to improve the FOV and image quality have been introduced by acquiring multiple conventional single-view images with small transducer movements. These methods rely on image registration to align singleview images, and therefore, require sufficient overlap between images to obtain accurate alignment. In this study, we propose a method that relies on a multi-camera tracking system external to the images for image alignment, and therefore, it does not have the constraints of image overlap or quality. The multicamera tracking system is capable of tracking position and orientation information of several objects simultaneously. The accuracy of the alignment of the multi-camera tracking system is superior to the image resolution of echocardiography images. In this pilot project, we used a dynamic heart phantom and a cuboid gelatin phantom to evaluate our method and showed that the proposed method yielded an accurate alignment of image volumes in three-dimensional space.	align (company);cuboid;image quality;image registration;image resolution;imaging phantom;match moving;oracle fusion architecture;phantom reference;real-time clock;tracking system;transducer	Kumaradevan Punithakumar;Peter William Wood;Marina Biamonte;Michelle Noga;Pierre Boulanger;Harald Becher	2014	IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI)	10.1109/BHI.2014.6864367	computer vision;radiology;medical physics	Robotics	41.676276607091296	-84.71484885993202	156579
ca591b2c2a1827e09621e03abbcbaf7b282590d1	whole brain reconstruction from multilayered sections of a mouse model of status epilepticus		This research concerns confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging of the whole brain of C57BL/6 mice with single-cell resolution. These brains are too large for specimen holders in available 3D microscopes, so this research develops a set of volume reconstruction methods to reproduce a whole brain from multilayered, thin sections of the brain imaged using a confocal microscope. As the sections are in solution during imaging, their shapes warp differently, and their structures no longer align. The proposed two-stage reconstruction procedure consists of single-section correction and section-to-section alignment, towards producing a whole brain volume. In the first stage, the proposed method carefully unwarps the distorted shapes of each section. The second stage aligns prominent features between the layers of neighboring sections. This paper also newly considers how these stages influence each other in the broader context of whole brain volume reconstruction. Experimental results portraying each stage with real image data suggest that the proposed approach can produce consistent 3D volumes and largely correct the observed distortions.	3d computer graphics;align (company);biological specimen;brain implant;distortion	Haoyi Liang;Natalia Dabrowska;Jaideep Kapur;Daniel S.

This paper presents an automated algorithm for serial alignment of fetal tissue in MRI of pregnant mice. The algorithm extends our former algorithm to allow follow up across time between 3D MR sequences in a difficult novel small animal application. The algorithm is based on features combining intensity and geometric information and the registration energy function is minimized by alternating optimization with regard to the feature correspondence and transformation model. Experimental validation on a set of MRI acquisition with fetal livers and placentas demonstrate the high accuracy and promise of the approach. The results confirm that measures of development can be automatically derived from multifetal pregnancy in mice.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;sequence alignment	Ayelet Akselrod-Ballin;Reut Avni;Michal Neeman	2014	2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)	10.1109/ISBI.2014.6867988	radiology;pathology;anatomy	Vision	43.1149140785924	-82.19240106890906	157164
0cb2d06439e593f22d2738fc16ce8cf039ed31c8	neurosurgical burr hole placement using the microsoft hololens		PURPOSE: Tracked navigation systems are generally impractical in bedside neurosurgical procedures, such as a twist-drill crainiostomy for the removal of a subdural hematoma, where the use of navigation could optimize the placement of the drill in relation to the underlying fluid. We use the Microsoft HoloLens to display a hologram floating in the patient’s head to mark a burr hole on the skull. METHODS: A 3D model of the head, hematoma and burr hole is created from CT and imported to the HoloLens. The hologram is interactively registered to the patient and the burr hole is marked on the skull. 3D Slicer, Unity, and Visual Studio were used for software development. The system was tested by 6 inexperienced and 1 experienced users. They each performed 6 registrations on phantoms with fiducial markers placed at 3 plausible burr hole locations on each side of the head. Registration accuracy was determined by measuring the distance between the holographic and physical markers. RESULTS: Inexperienced users placed 98% of the markers within the clinically acceptable range of 10 mm in an average time of 4:46 min. The experienced user placed 100% of the markers within the acceptable range in an average time of 2:52 min. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to mark a neurosurgical burr hole location with clinically acceptable accuracy using the Microsoft HoloLens, within an acceptable length of time. This technology may also prove useful for procedures that require higher accuracy of drill location and drain trajectory such as the placement of external ventricular drains.	3dslicer;erdős–burr conjecture;experience;fiducial marker;holography;interactivity;maxima and minima;microsoft hololens;microsoft visual studio;microsoft windows 98;multistage interconnection networks;polygonal modeling;software development;unity	Emily Rae;Andras Lasso;Matthew S.

4b8ee502bbdc0bb9e06e3bf7869d53a881d8ac68	a 3d reconstruction method for gastroscopic minimally invasive surgery		Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) has offered great benefits to the patients for reducing patient trauma and recovery time. However, traditional MIS still has some challenges due to the loss of 3D vision and the narrow field of view provided by the endoscope. In this paper, we propose a method to reconstruct real 3D model of gastric internal surface based on gastroscopic image sequences, which can supply a significant navigation for surgeons during MIS procedure. This method utilizes a novel six-degree of freedom (6-DOF) tracking sensor to record endoscope’s real-time position information, and Structure from Motion (SFM) theory is adopted to generate 3D gastric internal surface model. The system is experimented on simulated gastric model. The 3D depth accuracy is estimated at 9.8 mm, which is suitable for clinic practice. Theoretically, this system can be applied to MIS not only on stomach but also on other organs.	3d reconstruction;minimally invasive education	Dong Yang;Yinhong Zhao;Jiquan Liu;Bin Wang;Huilong Duan	2015		10.1007/978-3-662-47791-5_28	3d reconstruction;endoscope;structure from motion;computer science;field of view;surgery	Vision	41.05186084153216	-85.06598138285554	157297

The proposed method is: first, select two guiding points; then, use the guiding points to construct X-ray cone-beams, so the joining section of the cone-beams can be used to determine the puncture target point. The method was verified by a phantom emulation, in which the calculated target-points were all found within the central part of the target lesion, and far away from the boarder of the lesion (change the X-ray tube angle by 15° would only cause a slight deviation no more than 1.4 mm), the accuracy is enough to fulfill the needs of biopsy operation. This study also found out that, the shorter the distance between the guiding point and the center of the lesion's project, the nearer the calculated biopsy-point will be to the actual lesion center.	diagnostic radiologic examination;digital mammography;emulator;imaging phantom;phantoms, imaging;puncture procedure;algorithm;biopsy of breast	Jian Wu;Peng Gao;Xiu-wang Li;Yibin Huang	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610014	ground-penetrating radar;radiology;mathematical model;mathematics;nuclear medicine;physics;statistics;medical physics	Robotics	39.97671901817339	-84.19867332616712	157322
d5178322545185a26efad5f30544107ab6fd316e	efficient 3-d model-based reconstruction scheme for arbitrary optoacoustic acquisition geometries		Optimal optoacoustic tomographic sampling is often hindered by the frequency-dependent directivity of ultrasound sensors, which can only be accounted for with an accurate 3-D model. Herein, we introduce a 3-D model-based reconstruction method applicable to optoacoustic imaging systems employing detection elements with arbitrary size and shape. The computational complexity and memory requirements are mitigated by introducing an efficient graphic processing unit (GPU)-based implementation of the iterative inversion. On-the-fly calculation of the entries of the model-matrix via a small look-up table avoids otherwise unfeasible storage of matrices typically occupying more than 300GB of memory. Superior imaging performance of the suggested method with respect to standard optoacoustic image reconstruction methods is first validated quantitatively using tissue-mimicking phantoms. Significant improvements in the spatial resolution, contrast to noise ratio and overall 3-D image quality are also reported in real tissues by imaging the finger of a healthy volunteer with a hand-held volumetric optoacoustic imaging system.	3d modeling;auditory perceptual disorders;body tissue;computational complexity theory;contrast resolution;contrast-to-noise ratio;image quality;iterative method;iterative reconstruction;lookup table;mobile device;phantoms, imaging;photoacoustic imaging;requirement;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;sensor	Lu Ding;Xos&#x00E9; Lu&#x00ED;s De&#x00E1;n-Ben;Daniel Razansky	2017	IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging	10.1109/TMI.2017.2704019	computer vision;iterative reconstruction;artificial intelligence;computational complexity theory;contrast-to-noise ratio;tomography;image quality;ultrasonic sensor;solid modeling;image resolution;computer science	Vision	49.79447204560036	-81.83067572691202	157343

b677bf165f6013ca491fdb334a24dd28fdd7e14a	joint restoration of bi-contrast mri data for spatial intensity non-uniformities	bi contrast mri restoration;mri bias field correction;generalized co occurrence statistics;non stationary wiener filtering	The reconstruction of MRI data assumes a uniform radiofrequency field. However, in practice the radio-frequency field is inhomogeneous and leads to non-biological intensity non-uniformities across an image. This artifact can complicate further automated analysis of the data. In general, an acquisition protocol provides images of the same anatomic region with multiple contrasts representing similar underlying information, but suffering from different intensity non-uniformities. A method is presented for the joint intensity uniformity restoration of two such images. The effect of the intensity distortion on the auto-co-occurrence statistics of each of the two images as well as in their joint-co-occurrence statistics is modeled and used for their restoration with Wiener filtering. Several regularity constrains for the anatomy and for the non-uniformity are also imposed. Moreover, the method considers an inevitable difference between the signal regions of the two images. The joint treatment of the images can improve the accuracy and the efficiency of the restoration as well as decrease the requirements for additional calibration scans. The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated extensively with both phantom and real brain anatomic data as well as with real DIXON pairs of fat and water abdominal data.

These efficiencies can be computed by comparing the number of coincidence counts obtained when the crystals are equally illuminated by the same source. However, because the number of coincidence counts acquired for one crystal also depends on the efficiency of the other crystals in coincidence, most methods of crystal efficiency calculation need to assume that the influence of the other crystals is negligible. If there are large crystal efficiency variations, this approximation may lead to systematic errors. The authors have recently implemented an iterative method for a single ring of detectors that does not rely on this assumption. Here, they describe a fully three dimensional (3-D) iterative method that better exploits the sensitivity of the tomograph and allows reduced acquisition times or the use of narrow energy windows. They compare the performance of the iterative method (single-ring and extended to fully 3-D) with noniterative techniques for different acquisition times of a uniform cylinder. Two different energy windows were used to assess the performance of each method with different levels of variations of crystal efficiency. The results showed that the iterative methods are more accurate when large efficiency variations exist and that only the fully 3-D methods provided good efficiency estimates with very low duration scans. The authors, thus, conclude that iterative fully 3-D methods provide the best estimations and can be used in a larger range of situations than can the other methods tested.	approximation;ct scan;crystal oscillator;cylinder-head-sector;detectors;efficiency;estimated;iterative method;large;microsoft windows;polyethylene terephthalate;positron-emission tomography;positrons;radioisotopes;tomography, emission-computed, single-photon	N.

Capillary density and red blood cell (RBC) velocity provide a measure of tissue perfusion. Estimating RBC velocity is a challenging problem due to noisy video sequences, low contrast between the vessels and the background, and thousands of RBCs moving rapidly through video sequences. Typically, physicians manually trace small blood vessels and visually estimate RBC velocities. The task is labor intensive, tedious, and time-consuming. In this paper, we present a novel application of a principal curve tracing algorithm to automatically track RBCs across video frames and estimate their velocity based on the displacements of RBCs between two consecutive frames. The proposed method is implemented in one sublingual microcirculation video of a healthy subject.	algorithm;perfusion scanning;role-based collaboration;velocity (software development)	Sheng You;Esra Ataer Cansizoglu;Deniz Erdogmus;Michael Massey;Nathan Shapiro	2012	2012 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing	10.1109/MLSP.2012.6349763	computer vision;medicine;pathology;surgery	Vision	42.317888570637386	-82.68116776761326	157796
b06a3863f59dbfcebcc6d4b18b1c3a6bdc109c26	robust, accurate and fast automatic segmentation of the spinal cord		Spinal cord segmentation provides measures of atrophy and facilitates group analysis via inter-subject correspondence. Automatizing this procedure enables studies with large throughput and minimizes user bias. Although several automatic segmentation methods exist, they are often restricted in terms of image contrast and field-of-view. This paper presents a new automatic segmentation method (PropSeg) optimized for robustness, accuracy and speed. The algorithm is based on the propagation of a deformable model and is divided into three parts: firstly, an initialization step detects the spinal cord position and orientation using a circular Hough transform on multiple axial slices rostral and caudal to the starting plane and builds an initial elliptical tubular mesh. Secondly, a low-resolution deformable model is propagated along the spinal cord. To deal with highly variable contrast levels between the spinal cord and the cerebrospinal fluid, the deformation is coupled with a local contrast-to-noise adaptation at each iteration. Thirdly, a refinement process and a global deformation are applied on the propagated mesh to provide an accurate segmentation of the spinal cord. Validation was performed in 15 healthy subjects and two patients with spinal cord injury, using T1- and T2-weighted images of the entire spinal cord and on multiecho T2*-weighted images. Our method was compared against manual segmentation and against an active surface method. Results show high precision for all the MR sequences. Dice coefficients were 0.9 for the T1- and T2-weighted cohorts and 0.86 for the T2*-weighted images. The proposed method runs in less than 1min on a normal computer and can be used to quantify morphological features such as cross-sectional area along the whole spinal cord.	acclimatization;atrophic;caudal;cerebrospinal fluid;chest;coefficient;cross-sectional data;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;hough transform;ibm 727;iteration;neck;patients;q10;refinement (computing);silo (dataset);software propagation;sourceforge;spinal cord injuries;spinal cord neoplasms;throughput;time complexity;algorithm;biologic segmentation	Benjamin De Leener;Samuel Kadoury;Julien Cohen-Adad	2014	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.04.051	anatomy;surgery	Vision	41.19390922592692	-81.06115953219724	158003

Methods: As part of a special issue on model sharing and reproducibility in the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, two manuscripts on computational biomechanics were submitted: Rajagopal et al., IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., 2016 and Schmitz and Piovesan, IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., 2016. Models used in these studies were shared with the scientific reviewers and the public. In addition to the standard review of the manuscripts, the reviewers downloaded the models and performed simulations that reproduced results reported in the studies. Results: There was general agreement between simulation results of the authors and those of the reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved during the necessary revisions. The manuscripts and instructions for download and simulation were updated in response to the reviewers' feedback; changes that may otherwise have been missed if explicit model sharing and simulation reproducibility analysis was not conducted in the review process. Increased burden on the authors and the reviewers, to facilitate model sharing and to repeat simulations, were noted. Conclusion: When the authors of computational biomechanics studies provide access to models and data, the scientific reviewers can download and thoroughly explore the model, perform simulations, and evaluate simulation reproducibility beyond the traditional manuscript-only review process. Significance: Model sharing and reproducibility analysis in scholarly publishing will result in a more rigorous review process, which will enhance the quality of modeling and simulation studies and inform future users of computational models.	computation;computational model;download;manuscripts;published comment;simulation;source-to-source compiler	Ahmet Erdemir;Trent M.

Preliminary results in a study of 3 patients demonstrate the successful combination of the two technologies as well as improved accuracy of the patient-specific models throughout the surgery. The augmented reality visualizations enabled the surgeon to accurately visualize the anatomy of interest for an extended period of the intervention. These results demonstrate the potential for these technologies to become useful tools for neurosurgeons to improve patient-specific planning by prolonging the use of reliable neuronavigation.	augmented reality	Ian Gerard;Marta Kersten-Oertel;Simon Drouin;Jeffery A.

Specifically, identifying tissue that is under-supplied with blood is important when choosing a suitable therapy for patients with coronary heart disease. Before an analysis can be carried out, the images must be registered to compensate for cardiac and respiratory motion. This is a difficult problem, as the motion is non-rigid and because the image contrast varies strongly over time due to the injection of a contrast agent into the blood stream. To address these problems, an automatic non-rigid registration approach is presented that utilizes local phase instead of intensity or gradient information.	gradient descent	Lennart Tautz;Anja Hennemuth;Mats T.

CCT, however, has not been previously evaluated for quantification of diffuse myocardial fibrosis. In our investigation, we sought to evaluate the potential of low-dose CCT for the measurement of myocardial whole heart extracellular volume (ECV) fraction. ECV is altered under conditions of increased myocardial fibrosis. A framework consisting of three main steps was proposed for CCT whole heart ECV estimation. First, a shape-constrained graph cut (GC) method was proposed for myocardium and blood pool segmentation on postcontrast image. Second, the symmetric demons deformable registration method was applied to register precontrast to postcontrast images. So the correspondences between the voxels from precontrast to postcontrast images were established. Finally, the whole heart ECV value was computed. The proposed method was tested on 20 clinical low-dose CCT datasets with precontrast and postcontrast images. The preliminary results demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.	ct scan;computed tomography of the heart	Xinjian Chen;Marcelo S. Nacif;Songtao Liu;Christopher T.

73a8f6c0a6f871383384ef408934edef3814dd74	biomedical image registration		Sliding organs pose challenges in the registration of dynamic medical images because the smoothness criterion which is commonly assumed over the whole image domain does not apply at the sliding interfaces. In this case, image registration methods have to cope with local discontinuities in the correspondence map. We present a new registration methodology based on a multi-resolution transformation model which is defined as a directed acyclic graph. The graph’s edges connect consecutive resolution levels enabling to inhomogeneously pass displacements through to higher levels. Thus, they are well suited to cope with local discontinuities while aiming at smooth correspondence maps. We introduce three regularization terms which operate on the graph. A total variation term ensuring discontinuity preserving smoothness, a sparsity term on zero edge-weights to prevent trivial solutions and a term which prefers transformations which are explained in lower resolution levels. For an early proof of concept we analyze the registration performance of our method on synthetic 2D data and on a 2D slice of the POPI model.	approximation-preserving reduction;directed acyclic graph;image registration;map;reflections of signals on conducting lines;sparse matrix;synthetic data	Stefan Klein;Marius Staring;Stanley Durrleman;Stefan Sommer	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-92258-4	computer vision;image registration;artificial intelligence;computer science	Vision	45.857621213765825	-81.96299798092322	159256

The system consists of a Pentium PC equipped with an RGB frame grabber, a three-chip charge coupled devices (CCD) camera controlled by the serial port and equipped with a zoom lens and a halogen annular light source. Calibration of the imaging system provides a way to transform the acquired images, which are defined in an unknown color space, to a standard, well-defined color space called SRGB, sRGB has a known relation to the CIE/sup 1/ XYZ and CIE L*a*b* colorimetric spaces. These CIE color spaces are based on the human vision, and they allow the computation of a color difference metric called CIE /spl Delta/E/sub ab/*, which is proportional to the color difference, as seen by a human observer. Several types of polynomial RGB to sRGB transforms will be tried, including some optimized in perceptually uniform color spaces. The use of a standard and well-defined color space also allows meaningful exchange of images, e.g., in teledermatology. The calibration procedure is based on 24 patches with known color properties, and it takes about 5 minutes to perform. It results in a number of settings called a profile that remains valid for tens of hours of operation. Such a profile is checked before acquiring images using just one color patch, and is adjusted on the fly to compensate for short-term drift in the response of the imaging system. Precision or reproducibility of subsequent color measurements is very good with =0.3 and /spl Delta/E/sub ab/*<1.2. Accuracy compared with spectrophotometric measurements is fair with =6.2 and /spl Delta/E/sub ab/*><13.3.	cns disorder;charge-coupled device;checking (action);color image;color space;computability in europe;computation;countercurrent electrophoresis measurement;dermatology field;frame grabber;halogens;malignant neoplasm of skin;on the fly;patch (computing);patients;polynomial;serial port;three-ccd camera;transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation;xyz file format	Yves Vander Haeghen;J.

87c15bba92c458fd2bc508dcb4e5f58afd10ccc3	framework to quantify the metabolic rate in the heart using monte carlo simulation and compartmental modeling	analytical models;myocardium;heart;multi stage noise shaping;computational modeling;logic gates;weaving	The Nuclear Medicine imaging using PET modality allows evaluating the physiological condition of the heart (i.e. heart disease, perfusion, cardiac stress, physics disorders, etc.), by the use of small amounts of radioactive material. While the visual information provided by PET image is quite important and today is heavily used by the specialists, it is clear that having quantitative values of the metabolism would help to determine the real condition of the myocardium, to get a more accurate diagnosis and to apply a better treatment. Thus, we developed a framework using different tools to simulate a real PET exam focused in the heart in order to analyze the metabolic exchange in this organ. This research produced realistic PET exams by using GATE platform that performs Monte Carlo simulations, together with an anthropomorphic phantom of the whole body called MASH. This study consisted of the modeling of a commercial PET scanner with BGO detectors, where the MASH's thorax was imaged by the scanner. In order to enhance the realism of the simulation, clinical data was considered, like the quantity of radiotracer (FDG) injected, time of acquisition, and number of frames along the time, among others. Next, the projections were reconstructed using STIR's algorithms. With the aim of obtaining a better quality of the volumes and to select the specific ROI, filtering and segmentation algorithms were applied, respectively. Finally, the heart metabolic analysis was performed using a mathematical model that seeks to describe and to quantify the level of consumption and exchange of glucose in the heart through a model with three compartments. The metabolic parameters obtained were: K1=0.5690, k2=0.2266, k3=0.0718, and k4=0.0243. It was evidenced that the process of metabolic quantification using compartmental modeling is significantly relevant because of its flexibility, noninvasiveness and reliability. Hereafter, we will apply this framework under real PET images.	algorithm;computational human phantom;filter (signal processing);functional discourse grammar;gate;mathematical model;modality (human–computer interaction);monte carlo method;polyethylene terephthalate;region of interest;sensor;simulation	Edward Pacheco;Henrique Fonseca;Vishal Vijayakumar;Sérgio Shiguemi Furuie	2015	2015 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)	10.1109/CIC.2015.7408658	simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;biological engineering	Robotics	43.41456764984779	-84.44155661974685	159549

For physically measured data like it is used, e.g. in medical imaging applications one often introduces topological errors such as small handles that stem from measurement inaccuracy and cavities that are generated by tight folds of an organ. During isosurface extraction these measurement errors result in a surface whose genus is much higher than that of the actual surface. In many cases however, the topological type of the object under consideration is known beforehand, e.g., the cortex of a human brain is always homeomorphic to a sphere. By using topology preserving morphological operators we can exploit this knowledge to gradually dilate an initial set of voxels with correct topology until it fits the target isosurface. This approach avoids the formation of handles and cavities and guarantees a topologically correct reconstruction of the object’s surface.	algorithm;fits;genus (mathematics);gradient;isosurface;mathematical morphology;medical imaging;topology control;volume rendering;voxel	Stephan Bischoff;Leif Kobbelt	2002		10.1109/PCCGA.2002.1167868	computer vision;computational geometry;computer science;mathematics;geometry;digital topology;computer graphics (images);observational error	Visualization	45.56860055415094	-80.51111721329775	159620

Due to the partial volume effect, accurate localisation of subtle features through the cardiac cycle, such as the trabeculae and papillary muscles, is difficult. This problem is exacerbated by the short acquisition window necessary to avoid motion blur and ghosting, especially during early systole. This paper presents an adaptive imaging approach with COMB multi-tag tracking that follows true 3D motion of the myocardium so that the same tissue slice is imaged throughout the cine acquisition. The technique is demonstrated with motion-compensated multi-slice imaging of ventricles, which allows for tracked visualisation and analysis of the trabeculae and papillary muscles for the first time. This enables novel in-vivo measurement of circumferential and radial strain for trabeculation and papillary muscle contractility. These statistics will facilitate the evaluation of diseases such as mitral valve insufficiency and ischemic heart disease. The adaptive imaging technique will also have significant implications for CMR in general, including motion-compensated quantification of myocardial perfusion and blood flow, and motion-correction of sequences with long acquisition windows.

Implants and anatomic models are manufactured using computed tomography (CT) image data and a system to generate Instructions for numerically controlled machines. The system combines clinical imaging, an algorithm for 3D edge detection, computer communications, and computer-aided and manufacturing (CAD/CAM).

This work is particularly useful during brachytherapy procedures, in which planning for radioactive seed insertion is performed on preoperative scans, and significant deformation of the prostate can occur during the procedure. The approach makes use of a patient specific biomechanical model to run simulations for TRUS probe insertion, extract the main modes of the deformation of the prostate, and use this information to establish a deformable registration between 2 orthogonal cross-sectional ultrasound images and the preoperative prostate. In the work presented here, the approach is tested on an anatomy-realistic biomechanical phantom for the prostate and results are reported for 5 test simulations. More than 73% of maximum deformation of the prostate was recovered, with the estimation error mostly attributed to the relatively small number of biomechanical simulations used for training.	coefficient;cross-sectional data;displacement mapping;imaging phantom;mathematical optimization;medical ultrasound;simulation;sparse matrix;statistical model	Ashraf Mohamed;Christos Davatzikos;Russell H.

However, recent efforts attempting to use an array of acoustic sensors for diagnostic purposes has seen marginal success owing to the simplifying assumptions employed in their models. In particular, factors such as heterogeneity of medium, shear wave contributions and extreme near-field conditions are often ignored. This work presents a 2D numerical model capable of simulating the propagation of intra-thoracic acoustic sources that can assist in development of improved diagnostic schemes. Specifically, the model employs a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme to solve the viscoelastic wave equations while taking the intrinsic anatomy and associated stiffness properties of various tissue structures into account. The simulated sound distribution maps can then be employed to develop better inverse problem techniques for disease diagnosis.	acoustic cryptanalysis;computer simulation;finite-difference time-domain method;map;marginal model;mathematical model;sensor;software propagation	Sridhar Ramakrishnan;Satish S.

In order to help surgeons improve the positioning accuracy of the components, a visual-aided system for THR surgeries that could estimate orientation and depth of femoral component is proposed. The sensors are fixed inside the femoral prosthesis trial and checkerboard patterns are printed on the internal surface of the acetabular prosthesis trial. An extended Kalman filter is designed to fuse the data from inertial sensors and the magnetometer orientation estimation. A novel image processing algorithm for depth estimation is developed. The algorithms have been evaluated under the simulation with rotation quaternion and translation vector and the experimental results shows that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the orientation estimation is less then 0.05 degree and the RMSE for depth estimation is 1mm. Finally, the femoral head is displayed in 3D graphics in real time to help surgeons with the component positioning.	3d computer graphics;algorithm;dislocations;extended kalman filter;fuse device component;head of femur;hip replacement arthroplasty (procedure);image processing;image sensor;mean squared error;operative surgical procedures;plant roots;printing;prosthesis implantation;quaternions and spatial rotation;simulation;total hip replacement (procedure);magnetometers;sensor (device)	Jiyang Gao;Shaojie Su;Hong Chen;Zhihua Wang	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318958	text mining;medical research;simulation;computer science;engineering;biological engineering;surgery	Robotics	40.09719517849301	-84.25573526001354	160767

Compared to mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis is a new imaging technique that may improve the diagnostic accuracy by removing the ambiguities of overlapped tissues and providing 3D information of the breast. Tomosynthesis reconstruction algorithms generate 3D reconstructed slices from a few limited angle projection images. Among different reconstruction algorithms, back projection (BP) is considered an important foundation of quite a few reconstruction techniques with deblurring algorithms such as filtered back projection. In this paper, two BP variants, including α-trimmed BP and principal component analysis-based BP, were proposed to improve the image quality against that of traditional BP. Computer simulations and phantom studies demonstrated that the α-trimmed BP may improve signal response performance and suppress noise in breast tomosynthesis image reconstruction.	algorithm;backpropagation;body tissue;computational human phantom;deblurring;digital mammography;experiment;flow-based programming;image quality;imaging system;imaging techniques;iterative reconstruction;malignant neoplasm of breast;mammary neoplasms;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;physiologic calcification;principal component analysis;projection defense mechanism;reconstruction filter;simulation;tomosynthesis	Weihua Zhou;Jianping Lu;Otto Zhou;Ying Chen	2014	Journal of Digital Imaging	10.1007/s10278-014-9736-6	computer vision;nuclear medicine;medical physics	Vision	45.997629830605845	-83.21022846641488	161321

It utilizes a user-defined seed point to set up a directed 3D graph. The nodes of the 3D graph are obtained by sampling along rays that are sent through the surface points of a polyhedron. Additionally, several arcs and a parameter constrain the set of possible segmentations and enforce smoothness. After the graph has been constructed, the minimal cost closed set on the graph is computed via a polynomial time s-t cut, creating an optimal segmentation of the object. The presented method has been evaluated on 50 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data sets with World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV gliomas (glioblastoma multiforme). The ground truth of the tumor boundaries were manually extracted by three clinical experts (neurological surgeons) with several years (> 6) of experience in resection of gliomas and afterwards compared with the automatic segmentation results of the proposed scheme yielding an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 80.37±8.93%. However, no segmentation method provides a perfect result, so additional editing on some slices was required, but these edits could be achieved quickly because the automatic segmentation provides a border that fits mostly to the desired contour. Furthermore, the manual segmentation by neurological surgeons took 2-32 minutes (mean: 8 minutes), in contrast to the automatic segmentation with our implementation that took less than 5 seconds.

In addition, it is shown how such a system is used to accelerate iterative algorithms, whereby the forward projection is performed by graphics hardware. The performance for iterative approaches is 4 min for SIRT (10 iterations) and 3 minutes for OS-EM (6 iterations) where the main limitation is the forward projection.	3d reconstruction;algorithm;cone beam reconstruction;field-programmable gate array;graphics hardware;iteration;maxima and minima;virtex (fpga);voxel	Dzmitry Stsepankou;Klaus Kornmesser;Jürgen Hesser;Reinhard Männer	2004	Proceedings. 2004 IEEE International Conference on Field- Programmable Technology (IEEE Cat.

34184b269770434a76c2bf0ccb6f4d2e66cfcbf5	an automatic and patient-specific algorithm to design the optimal insertion direction of pedicle screws for spine surgery templates	pedicle arthrodesis;screw direction optimization;spine surgery;surgical template;x-ray minimization	Many diseases of the spine require surgical treatments that are currently performed based on the experience of the surgeon. For pedicle arthrodesis surgery, two critical factors must be addressed: Screws must be applied correctly and exposure to harmful radiation must be avoided. The incorrect positioning of the screws may cause operating failures that lead to subsequent reoperations, an increase in the overall duration of surgery and, therefore, more harmful, real-time X-ray checks. In this paper, the authors solve these problems by developing a method to realize a customized surgical template that acts as a drilling template. The template has two cylindrical guides that follow a correct trajectory previously calculated by means of an automatic algorithm generated on the basis of a vertebra CAD model for a specific patient. The surgeon sets the template (drilling guides) on the patient’s vertebra and safely applies the screws. Three surgical interventions for spinal stabilization have been performed using the template. These have had excellent results with regard to the accuracy of the screw positioning, reduction of the overall duration of the intervention, and reduction of the number of times the patient was exposed to X-rays.	bone structure of spine;clinical use template;clinical act of insertion;computer case screws;computer-aided design;customize;diagnostic radiologic examination;insertion mutation;operative surgical procedures;patients;pedicle screws;procedure on spinal cord (procedure);rajiformes;real-time clock;repeat surgery;screw;x-ray (amazon kindle);algorithm;dendritic spine neck	Francesco Naddeo;Emilio Cataldo;Alessandro Naddeo;Nicola Cappetti;Nicola Narciso	2017	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-017-1627-9	engineering;biological engineering;engineering drawing;surgery	Robotics	39.40241084649649	-84.55237673168057	162455

We have developed an analysis technique based on a laser speckle imaging method that generates rapid, high-resolution perfusion images. We have called it laser speckle perfusion imaging (LSPI). This paper investigates LSPI output and compares it to LDI using blood flow models designed to simulate human skin at various levels of pigmentation. Results show that LSPI parameters can be chosen such that the instrumentation exhibits a similar response to changes in red blood cell concentration (0.1%-5%, 200 /spl mu/L/min) and velocity (0-800 /spl mu/L/min, 1% concentration) and, given its higher resolution and quicker response time, could provide a significant advantage over LDI for some applications. Differences were observed in the LDI and LSPI response to tissue optical properties. LDI perfusion values increased with increasing tissue absorption, while LSPI perfusion values showed a slight decrease. This dependence is predictable, owing to the perfusion algorithms specific to each instrument, and, if properly compensated for, should not influence each instrument's ability to measure relative changes in tissue perfusion.	blood cells;erythrocytes;exhibits as topic;image resolution;imaging techniques;instrument - device;instrumentation (attribute);instrumentation (computer programming);laser doppler imaging;laser speckle imaging;maxima and minima;perfusion (procedure);perfusion imaging;phantom reference;pigmentation;polarization (waves);response time (technology);simulation;velocity (software development);algorithm	Kevin R.

We applied principal axes of inertia to the three-dimensional (3D) trajectories generated by patient-specific simulations of TMJ movements for the functional evaluations of mandible movement. Three-dimensional movements of the mandible and the maxilla were tracked based on a patient-specific splint and an optical tracking system. The dental occlusion recorded on the sprint provided synchronization for initial movement in the tracking and the simulation phases. The translation and rotation recorded during movement tracking was applied sequentially to the mandibular model in relation to a fixed maxilla model. The sequential 3D positions of selected landmarks on the mandible were calculated based on the reference coordinate system. The landmarks selected for analysis were bilateral condyles and pogonion points. The moment of inertia tensor was calculated with respect to the 3D trajectory points. Using the unit vectors along the principal axes derived from the tensor matrix, α, β and γ rotations around z-, y- and x-axes were determined to represent the principal directions as principal rotations respectively. The γ direction showed the higher standard deviation, variation of directions, than other directions at all the landmarks. The mandible movement has larger kinematic redundancy in the γ direction than α and β during mouth opening and closing. Principal directions of inertia would be applied to analyzing the changes in angular motion of trajectories introduced by mandibular shape changes from surgical treatments and also to the analysis of the influence of skeletal deformities on mandibular movement asymmetry.	3d computer graphics;angularjs;bilateral filter;closing (morphology);congenital abnormality;cyclic redundancy check;dental occlusion;evaluation;large;mandible;maxilla;movement;operative surgical procedures;patients;pogonion;simulation;splint device;sprint (software development);standard deviation;structure of condyle;temporomandibular joint;tracking system	Dae-Seung Kim;Soon-Chul Choi;Sam-Sun Lee;Min-Suk Heo;Kyung-Hoe Huh;Soon-Jung Hwang;Seong-Ha Kim;Won-Jin Yi	2013	Computers in biology and medicine	10.1016/j.compbiomed.2012.12.007	anatomy	Vision	40.77729299147413	-82.98102432778215	162750
2f3898db45c3403656f3fafb15e52a2220b6d919	f-sim: a quasi-realistic fmri simulation toolbox using digital brain phantom and modeled noise		Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) uses a noninvasive technique to study the functionality of the human brain by measuring the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal and has been researched for decades. However, some potential problems still remain in achieving correct interpretation of BOLD-induced signals due to quite low signal levels, high noise levels, artifacts, lack of ground truth and a number of other inherent problems. We present here the development of a MATLAB based fMRI simulator (f-Sim) using digital phantom brain that generates quasi-realistic 4D fMRI volumes including modeled noise. Such 4D fMRI data can serve to hypothesize ground truth for experimentally acquired data under both task-evoked and resting state designs in investigation of localized or whole brain activation and functional connectivity patterns.	experiment;ground truth;matlab;phantom reference;resonance;resting state fmri;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Harshit S.

The purposes of these methods are to facilitate inter-modality registration, motion compensation, enhanced visualization or automatic landmark generation in augmented-reality applications. Most techniques incorporate a model of the device as prior information to evaluate results obtained from a low-level detector. In this paper, we present novel approaches which are able to generate both 2-D and 3-D models of circular and linear catheters from biplane X-ray images with only minimal user input. We apply these methods in the context of Electrophysiology to generate models of ablation and mapping catheters. An evaluation on clinical data sets yielded promising results.	augmented reality;high- and low-level;modality (human–computer interaction);motion compensation;radiography	Sebastian Kaeppler;Wen Wu;Terrence Chen;Martin Koch;Atilla P.

However, one of the difficulties radiation oncologists face is targeting moving tumors, such as those in the lung, which can change position during normal respiration. Tumor motion can be determined by directly monitoring tumor position using continuous xray imaging or electromagnetic transponders placed in the tumor that emit a signal. These approaches require potentially unnecessary radiation to the patient or acquisition of expensive technology. Alternatively, one can image the patient intermittently to determine tumor location and external markers placed on the patient’s torso. The external surrogates can then be used to determine an inferential model that would determine the tumor position as a function of external surrogates. These external surrogates can be monitored continuously in order to determine the real-time position of the tumor. In this study, we evaluate a machine learning algorithm for inferring intra-fraction tumor motion from external markers using a database of Cyberknife Synchrony system.	algorithm;inferential programming;machine learning;real-time clock;surrogates;transponder;virtual synchrony	Warren D.

In order to increase the resolution in both domains simultaneously, parallel imaging schemes have been in existence, where multiple receiver coils are used, each of which needs to acquire only a fraction of the total available signal. In our approach, we regularly un-dersample the signal at each of the receiver coils and the resulting aliased coil images are combined (unaliased) using the neural network framework. Data acquisition follows a variable-density sampling scheme, where lower frequencies are densely sampled, and the remaining signal is sparsely sampled. The low resolution images obtained using the densely sampled low frequencies are used to train the neural network. Reconstruction of the image is carried out by feeding the high-resolution aliased images to the trained network. The proposed approach has been applied to phantom as well as real brain MRI data sets, and results have been compared with the standard existing parallel imaging techniques. The proposed approach is found to perform better than the standard existing techniques.	aliasing (computing);artificial neural network;data acquisition;densely packed decimal;image resolution;imaging phantom;resonance;sampling (signal processing);tomographic reconstruction	Neelam Sinha;Manojkumar Saranathan;K.

Endoscopic LDF systems are typically limited in their usefulness in clinical contexts by the need for the natural organs to be immobilized, as serious motion artifacts due to the axial surface displacement can interfere with blood perfusion measurements. In our system, the focusing lens moves to track the motion of the target using a low-frequency reference signal in the optical data, enabling the suppression of these motion artifacts in the axial direction. This paper reports feasibility tests on a prototype of this system using a microfluidic phantom as a measurement target moving in the direction of the optical axis. The frequency spectra detected and the perfusion values calculated from those spectra show that the motion tracking system is capable of suppressing motion artifacts in perfusion readings. We compared the prototype LDF system's measurements with and without motion feedback, and found that motion tracking improves the fidelity of the perfusion signal by as much as 87%.	angioplasty, balloon, laser-assisted;axis vertebra;displacement mapping;laser-doppler flowmetry;lateral thinking;microfluidics;morphologic artifacts;motion capture;optic axis of a crystal;organ;perfusion imaging;perfusion scanning;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;prototype;psychologic displacement;reading (activity);tracking system;zero suppression;sensor (device)	Masaaki Hashimoto;Yoshihiro Taguchi	2018		10.3390/s18010277	engineering;analytical chemistry;perfusion;imaging phantom;optical axis;laser doppler velocimetry;match moving	Robotics	41.65632820227216	-85.94478765066586	164079

Image intensities are first transformed to a standard intensity gray scale by a standardization process. Different tissue sample regions are then obtained from the standardized image by simply thresholding based on fixed intensity intervals. For each tissue region, a polynomial is fitted to the estimated discrete background intensity variation. Finally, a combined polynomial is determined and used for correcting the intensity inhomogeneity in the whole image. The above procedure is repeated on the corrected image iteratively until the size of the extracted tissue regions does not change significantly in two successive iterations. Intensity scale standardization is effected to make sure that the corrected image is not biased by the fitting strategy. The method has been tested on a number of simulated and clinical MR images. These tests and a comparison with the method of non-parametric non-uniform intensity normalization (N3) indicate that the method is effective in background intensity inhomogeneity correction and may have a slight edge over the N3 method.

For de-noising of body surface potential signals we used FFT and also different types of wavelets as a de-nosing tool and compare their results with the help of a quantitative value called Signal Error Ratio (SER). Wavelets show better results in compare to FFT.

10c83448b54e20b679097a228fc9ea77470167fe	tracking microtubule ends is more than point tracking		Fluorescence microscopy has allowed studying dynamical biological processes in vivo with an ever increasing accuracy. Nonetheless, the physically inherent resolution limits impede the study of very dynamical intracellular processes such as microtubule dynamics. One way to overcome this limited resolution is to reconstruct the underlying object dynamics from the image data by using Bayesian statistics. This framework allows combining statistical models about the image formation process and the dynamical process driving the biological function under scrutiny. In this work we show that the accuracy and robustness of tracking microtubule dynamics can be improved by imposing a weak dynamical prior about the hidden geometry of the microtubule and by accounting for the overall photobleaching.	dynamical system;function (biology);image formation;statistical model;video-in video-out	Denis K.

A test device consisting of two resonant micro-coils and a passive marker is proposed for detection using image-based algorithms. Micro-coils allow for automated initialization of the object detection in dedicated low flip angle projection images; then the passive marker is tracked in clinical real-time MR images, with alternation between two oblique orthogonal image planes along the test device axis; in case the passive marker is lost in real-time images, the workflow is reinitialized. The proposed workflow was designed to minimize dedicated acquisition time to a single dedicated acquisition in the ideal case (no reinitialization required).

Here, we acquired FID navigators at different sampling rates and simultaneously measured head movements using a highly accurate optical motion tracking system. This strategy allowed us to estimate the accuracy and precision of FID navigators for quantification of rigid-body head movements. Five subjects were scanned with a 32-channel head coil array on a clinical 3T MR scanner during several resting and guided head movement periods. For each subject we trained a linear regression model based on FID navigator and optical motion tracking signals. FID-based motion model accuracy and precision was evaluated using cross-validation. FID-based prediction of rigid-body head motion was found to be with a mean translational and rotational error of 0.14±0.21 mm and 0.08±0.13°, respectively. Robust model training with sub-millimeter and sub-degree accuracy could be achieved using 100 data points with motion magnitudes of ±2 mm and ±1° for translation and rotation. The obtained linear models appeared to be subject-specific as inter-subject application of a “universal” FID-based motion model resulted in poor prediction accuracy. The results show that substantial rigid-body motion information is encoded in FID navigator signal time courses. Although, the applied method currently requires the simultaneous acquisition of FID signals and optical tracking data, the findings suggest that multi-channel FID navigators have a potential to complement existing tracking technologies for accurate rigid-body motion detection and correction in MRI.	coil device component;complement system proteins;cross-validation (statistics);data point;estimated;genetic translation process;head movements;linear model;motion capture;movement;muscle rigidity;numerous;quantitation;resonance;rest;salicylic acid 20 mg/ml medicated liquid soap;sampling (signal processing);scanning systems;tracking system;millimeter;triangulation	Maryna Babayeva;Tobias Kober;Benjamin R.

bc5fc1220bd5bde6208e666d86572f8d49dde2a2	detection of tooth fractures in cbct images using attention index estimation	computed tomography;teeth;algorithms	ABSTRACT The attention index ( i ) is a number from zero to one that indicates a possible fracture is detect ed inside a selected tooth. The h igher the i number , the greater the likelihood for needed attention in the visual examination. The method developed for the i estimation extracts a connected component with image properties that are similar to those of a typical tooth fracture. That is, in c one -beam computed tomography (CBCT) images, a fracture appears as a dark canyon inside the tooth . In order to start the visual examination process , the method provides a plane across the geometric center of the suspicious fracture component, which maximizes t he number of pixels from that component inside the plane. During visual examination, the user (doctor) can change plane orientation s and location s, by manipulating the mouse toward different graphical elements that represent the plane on a 3 -D rendition of the tooth, while the corresponding image of the plane is shown at its side. The visual examination aims at confirming or disproving the fracture -detection event. We have designed and implemented these algorithms using the image -foresting transform methodo logy.

365b7e2e9854976a3e32a16c89be88ce4022cdd8	evaluation of novel genetic algorithm generated schemes for positron emission tomography (pet)/magnetic resonance imaging (mri) image fusion	software;breast neoplasms;female;color;image processing computer assisted;positron emission tomography;magnetic resonance imaging;algorithms;humans;finite element analysis	The use and benefits of a multimodality approach in the context of breast cancer imaging are discussed. Fusion techniques that allow multiple images to be viewed simultaneously are discussed. Many of these fusion techniques rely on the use of color tables. A genetic algorithm that generates color tables that have desired properties such as satisfying the order principle, the rows, and columns principle, have perceivable uniformity and have maximum contrast is introduced. The generated 2D color tables can be used for displaying fused datasets. The advantage the proposed method has over other techniques is the ability to consider a much larger set of possible color tables, ensuring that the best one is found. We asked radiologists to perform a set of tasks reading fused PET/MRI breast images obtained using eight different fusion techniques. This preliminary study clearly demonstrates the need and benefit of a joint display by estimating the inaccuracies incurred when using a side-by-side display. The study suggests that the color tables generated by the genetic algorithm are good choices for fusing MR and PET images. It is interesting to note that popular techniques such as the Fire/Gray and techniques based on the HSV color space, which are prevalent in the literature and clinical practice, appear to give poorer performance.	ct scan;choice behavior;circuit complexity;color space;column (database);data table;dynamic logic (digital electronics);estimated;futures studies;genetic algorithm;greater;handling (psychology);image fusion;image scaling;large;myeloproliferative syndrome, transient;mammary neoplasms;manuscripts;multimodal imaging;multimodal interaction;opponent process;picture archiving and communication system;polyethylene terephthalate;positron-emission tomography;positrons;radiology;relational interface system;resonance;tamoxifen;version;voxel;benefit	Karl G.

4411c17d47f5217368ee697492bdcc65c11fb62d	on reconstruction and segmentation of piecewise continous images	piecewise continous images	We evaluate an image model for simultaneous reconstruction and segmentation of piecewise continuous images. The model assumes that the intensities of the piecewise continuous image are relatively constant within contiguous regions and that the intensity levels of these regions can be determined either empirically or theoretically before reconstruction. The assumptions might be valid, for example, in cardiac blood-pool imaging or in transmission tomography of the thorax for nonuniform attenuation correction of emission tomography. In the former imaging situation, the intensities or radionuclide activities within the regions of myocardium, blood-pool and background may be relatively constant and the three activity levels can be distinct. For the latter case, the attenuation coefficients of bone, lungs and soft tissues can be determined prior to reconstructing the attenuation map. The contiguous image regions are expected to be simultaneously segmented during image reconslruction. We tested the image model with experimental phantom studies. The phantom consisted of a plastic cylinder having an elliptical cross section and containing five contiguous regions. There were three distinct activity levels within the phantom. Projection data were acquired using a SPECT system. Reconstructions were performed using an iterative maximum a posteriori probability procedure. As expected, the reconstructed image consisted of contiguous regions and the acitivities within the regions were relatively constant. Compared with maximum likelihood and a Bayesian approach using a Gibbs prior, the results obtained using the image model demonstrated the improvement in identifying the contiguous regions and the associated activities.	coefficient;cross section (geometry);cylinder seal;imaging phantom;iterative method;phantom reference;tomography	Zhi-jie Liang;Ronald J.

8f245885114fd9086a765c2de52402117aec0420	computational multifocal microscopy		"""Despite recent advances, high performance single-shot 3D microscopy remains an elusive task. By introducing designed diffractive optical elements (DOEs), one is capable of converting a microscope into a 3D """"kaleidoscope"""", in which case the snapshot image consists of an array of tiles and each tile focuses on different depths. However, the acquired multifocal microscopic (MFM) image suffers from multiple sources of degradation, which prevents MFM from further applications. We propose a unifying computational framework which simplifies the imaging system and achieves 3D reconstruction via computation. Our optical configuration omits optical elements for correcting chromatic aberrations and redesigns the multifocal grating to enlarge the tracking area. Our proposed setup features only one single grating in addition to a regular microscope. The aberration correction, along with Poisson and background denoising, are incorporated in our deconvolution-based fully-automated algorithm, which requires no empirical parameter-tuning. In experiments, we achieve the spatial resolutions of 0.35um (lateral) and 0.5um (axial), which are comparable to the resolution that can be achieved with confocal deconvolution microscopy. We demonstrate a 3D video of moving bacteria recorded at 25 frames per second using our proposed computational multifocal microscopy technique. © 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement"""	3d reconstruction;algorithm;computation;deconvolution;elegant degradation;experiment;lateral thinking;noise reduction;snapshot (computer storage)	Kuan He;Zihao Wang;Xiang Huang;Xiaolei Wang;Seunghwan Yoo;Pablo H.

For this kind of registration problem we have developed a new segmentation procedure. Based on the obtained consistent segmentations, a nonlinear registration transformation is computed. The applied registration procedure uses a curvature-based nonlinear partial differential equation in order to find the appropriate mapping between the images. Finally, we present an example for the registration of images of two consecutive histological sections from a uterine cervix specimen, whereas one section stained with p16 was mapped onto another with H&E staining.	biological specimen;image registration;nonlinear system	Ulf-Dietrich Braumann;Jens Einenkel;Lars-Christian Horn;Jens-Peer Kuska;Markus Löffler;Nico Scherf;Nicolas Wentzensen	2006		10.1007/3-540-32137-3_47	pathology;optics;anatomy	Vision	48.20998257658945	-84.97712896392464	166491

An interventional telerobotic system, such as Robopsy, enables precise needle insertion, however, in order to minimize procedure time and number of CT scans, this system should be driven by an interface that is directly integrated with the medical imaging data. In this study we have developed and evaluated such an interface that provides the user with a point-and-click functionality for specifying the desired trajectory, segmenting the needle and automatically calculating the insertion parameters (angles and depth). In order to highlight the advantages of such an interface, we compared robotic-assisted targeting using the old interface (non-image-based) where the path planning was performed on the CT console and transferred manually to the interface with the targeting procedure using the new interface (image-based). We found that the mean procedure time (n=5) was 22±5 min (non-image-based) and 19±1 min (image-based) with a mean number of CT scans of 6±1 (non-image-based) and 5±1 (image-based). Although the targeting experiments were performed in gelatin with homogenous properties our results indicate that an image-based interface can reduce procedure time as well as number of CT scans for percutaneous needle biopsies.	ct scan;experiment;maxima and minima;medical imaging;motion planning;point and click;robot;telerobotics;tomography	Alexander Seitel;Conor J.

36144b06a3e51d6e19f85ce4f70a6d6447657fa9	deep learning and conditional random fields-based depth estimation and topographical reconstruction from conventional endoscopy	colonoscopy;conditional random fields;deep learning;endoscopy;learned depth;monocular depth estimation	Colorectal cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and the second leading cause in the United States. The risk of colorectal cancer can be mitigated by the identification and removal of premalignant lesions through optical colonoscopy. Unfortunately, conventional colonoscopy misses more than 20% of the polyps that should be removed, due in part to poor contrast of lesion topography. Imaging depth and tissue topography during a colonoscopy is difficult because of the size constraints of the endoscope and the deforming mucosa. Most existing methods make unrealistic assumptions which limits accuracy and sensitivity. In this paper, we present a method that avoids these restrictions, using a joint deep convolutional neural network-conditional random field (CNN-CRF) framework for monocular endoscopy depth estimation. Estimated depth is used to reconstruct the topography of the surface of the colon from a single image. We train the unary and pairwise potential functions of a CRF in a CNN on synthetic data, generated by developing an endoscope camera model and rendering over 200,000 images of an anatomically-realistic colon.We validate our approach with real endoscopy images from a porcine colon, transferred to a synthetic-like domain via adversarial training, with ground truth from registered computed tomography measurements. The CNN-CRF approach estimates depths with a relative error of 0.152 for synthetic endoscopy images and 0.242 for real endoscopy images. We show that the estimated depth maps can be used for reconstructing the topography of the mucosa from conventional colonoscopy images. This approach can easily be integrated into existing endoscopy systems and provides a foundation for improving computer-aided detection algorithms for detection, segmentation and classification of lesions.	algorithm;approximation error;artifact (software development);artificial neural network;autostereogram;biological neural networks;ct scan;cessation of life;colon classification;colonic neoplasms;colorectal carcinoma;computer-aided design;conditional random field;convolutional neural network;deep learning;depth map;endoscope device component;estimated;ground truth;medical imaging;morphologic artifacts;mucous membrane;porcine species;precancerous conditions;reflection (computer graphics);registration;rendering (computer graphics);scaffolding (bioinformatics);silo (dataset);synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;topography;tracer;unary operation;x-ray computed tomography;biologic segmentation;polyps	Faisal Mahmood;Nicholas J.

A target is chosen preoperatively based on anatomical landmarks identified on magnetic resonance images. This point is used as an initial position that is refined intraoperatively using both microelectrode recordings and macrostimulation. In this paper, we report on our current progress toward developing a system for the computer-assisted preoperative selection of target points and for the intraoperative adjustment of these points. The system consists of a deformable atlas of optimal target points that can be used to select automatically the preoperative target, of an electrophysiological atlas, and of an intraoperative interface. Results we have obtained show that automatic prediction of target points is an achievable goal. Our results also indicate that electrophysiological information could be used to resolve structures not visible in anatomic images, thus improving both preoperative and intraoperative guidance. Our intraoperative system has reached the stage of a working prototype and we compare targeting accuracy as well as the number of paths needed to reach the targets with our system and with the method in current clinical use.

50497e43fd1df1d204a83405cce9aa216a9b618d	real-time 6dof pose recovery from x-ray images using library-based drr and hybrid optimization	2d/3d registration;digitally reconstructed radiograph;image-guided intervention	Real-time 6 degrees of freedom (6DoF) pose recovery and tracking from X-ray images is a key enabling technology for many interventional imaging applications. However, real-time 2D/3D registration is a very challenging problem because of the heavy computation in iterative digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) generation. In this paper, we propose a real-time 2D/3D registration framework using library-based DRRs to achieve high computational efficiency. The proposed method pre-computes a library of canonical DRRs and reconstructs library-based DRRs (libDRRs) during registration without online rendering. The transformation parameters are decoupled to 2 geometry-relevant and 4 geometry-irrelevant ones so that canonical DRRs only need to cover the variation of 2 geometry-relevant parameters, making it practical to be pre-computed and stored. The 2D/3D registration using libDRRs is then solved as a hybrid optimization problem, i.e., continuous in geometry-irrelevant parameters while discrete in geometry-relevant parameters. On 5 fluoroscopic sequences with 246 frames acquired during animal studies with a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe in the field of view, 6DoF tracking of the TEE probe using the proposed method achieved a mean target registration error in the projection direction (mTREproj) of 0.81 mm, a success rate of 100 % (defined as mTREproj $$<$$ < 2.5 mm), and a registration frame rate of 23.1 fps on a pure CPU-based implementation executed in a single thread. Using libDRRs with a hybrid optimization can significantly improve the computational efficiency (up to tenfold) for 6DoF pose recovery and tracking with little degradation in robustness and accuracy, compared to conventional intensity-based 2D/3D registration using ray casting DRRs with a continuous optimization.	cpu (central processing unit of computer system);ct scan;central processing unit;computation;continuous optimization;deficit round robin;diagnostic service section id - radiograph;doppler echocardiography;echocardiography, transesophageal;elegant degradation;execution;frame (physical object);iterative method;mathematical optimization;okihiro syndrome;optimization problem;precomputation;radiography;ray casting;real-time clock;relevance;tee device component;x-ray (amazon kindle);registration - actclass	Shun Miao;Ahmet Tuysuzoglu;Z.

In order to be used in various algorithms, contours must be converted into binary labelmap volumes using voxelization. The voxelization process results in lost information, which has little effect on the volume of large structures, but has significant impact on small structures, which contain few voxels. Volume differences for segmented structures affects metrics such as dose volume histograms (DVH), which are used for treatment planning. Our goal is to evaluate the impact of voxelization on segmented structures, as well as how factors like voxel size affects metrics, such as DVH. METHODS: We create a series of implicit functions, which represent simulated structures. These structures are sampled at varying resolutions, and compared to labelmaps with high sub-millimeter resolutions. We generate DVH and evaluate voxelization error for the same structures at different resolutions by calculating the agreement acceptance percentage between the DVH. RESULTS: We implemented tools for analysis as modules in the SlicerRT toolkit based on the 3D Slicer platform. We found that there were large DVH variation from the baseline for small structures or for structures located in regions with a high dose gradient, potentially leading to the creation of suboptimal treatment plans. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates that labelmap and dose volume voxel size is an important factor in DVH accuracy, which must be accounted for in order to ensure the development of accurate treatment plans.	3dslicer;algorithm;baseline (configuration management);gradient;voxel	Kyle Sunderland;Csaba Pinter;Andras Lasso;Gabor Fichtinger	2016		10.1117/12.2216310	radiation therapy;simulation;computer science;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	40.05688289363295	-82.95975817545377	168299

However, in fluoroscopic images, visualization of the vasculature requires toxic contrast agent. Static vasculature roadmapping, which can reduce the usage of iodine contrast, is hampered by the breathing motion in abdominal catheterization. In this paper, we propose a method to track the catheter tip inside the patient’s 3D vessel tree using intra-operative single-plane 2D X-ray image sequences and a peri-operative 3D rotational angiography (3DRA). The method is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) where states of the model are the possible positions of the catheter tip inside the 3D vessel tree. The transitions from state to state model the probabilities for the catheter tip to move from one position to another. The HMM is updated following the observation scores, based on the registration between the 2D catheter centerline extracted from the 2D X-ray image, and the 2D projection of 3D vessel tree centerline extracted from the 3DRA. The method is extensively evaluated on simulated and clinical datasets acquired during liver abdominal catheterization. The evaluations show a median 3D tip tracking error of 2.3 mm with optimal settings in simulated data. The registered vessels close to the tip have a median distance error of 4.7 mm with angiographic data and optimal settings. Such accuracy is sufficient to help the physicians with an up-to-date roadmapping. The method tracks in real-time the catheter tip and enables roadmapping during catheterization procedures.	3d computer graphics;blood vessel;blood supply aspects;catheterization;contrast media;evaluation;extraction;hidden markov model;imagery;liver neoplasms;markov chain;patients;probability;radiography;real-time locating system;registration;rotational angiography;sodium fluoride 0.00243 mg/mg toothpaste;track (course);angiogram	Pierre Ambrosini;Ihor Smal;Daniel Ruijters;Wiro J.

The proposed image registration algorithm maintains one-to-one mapping between registered images by symmetrically warping them to another image. This makes the final estimation of forward and backward deformation fields anatomically plausible and applicable to adaptive prostate radiotherapy. The quantitative validation of the method is performed on magnetic resonance data obtained for pelvis area. The experiments demonstrate the improved robustness in terms of inverse consistency error and estimation accuracy of prostate position in comparison to the previously proposed methods.	algorithm;experiment;image registration;one-to-one (data model);resonance	Bartlomiej W.

To track anatomical shape changes in serial images, we introduce new point-based time sequence large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (TS-LDDMM) to infer the time flow of within-subject geometric shape changes that carry known observations through a period. Its Euler-Lagrange equation is generalized for anatomies whose shapes are characterized by point sets, such as landmarks, curves, and surfaces. The time-dependent momentum obtained from the TS-LDDMM encodes within-subject shape changes. For the purpose of across-subject shape comparison, we then propose a diffeomorphic analysis framework to translate within-subject deformation in a global template without incorporating across-subject anatomical variations via parallel transport technique. The analysis involves the retraction of the within-subject time-dependent momentum along the TS-LDDMM trajectory from each time to the baseline, the translation of the momentum in a global template, and the reconstruction of the TS-LDDMM trajectory starting from the global template.	baseline (configuration management);cerebral degeneration;clinical use template;color gradient;comparison of raster-to-vector conversion software;dental retraction (procedure);euler;euler–lagrange equation;inference;landmark point;large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping;neurodegenerative disorders;progressive disease;science of anatomy;time series;brain development	Anqi Qiu;Marilyn S.

b70561b32089f341a51b4a82fd3e8b32013d7c29	reduced k-space acquisition to accelerate mr imaging of moving interventional instruments: a phantom study	keyhole imaging;interventional mri;mr guidance	The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of reduced k-space sampling rates on the visualization of a moving MR-compatible puncture needle and to demonstrate the feasibility of keyhole imaging in interventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All experiments were performed in an open 1.0 Tesla MRI. MR images of a moving puncture needle were taken with different keyhole sampling rates from 15–100%, in 10% increments. The needle was submerged in a water-filled basin and was imaged in motion with a T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence with an initial acquisition rate of 1.4 s per image. An apparatus operated by a compressor unit enabled needle rotation and ensured reproducible needle movements. The median forward velocity of the needle tip was 2 cm/s. To evaluate the depiction of the needle, artifact diameter of the needle, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and needle tip profiles (delineation) were measured. The needle position was determined with an longitudinal error of 3 mm and a transverse error of 0.8 mm with respect to the needle’s orientation and the theoretically calculated trajectory. No significant correlation was found between the CNR and velocity. A reduction of k-space update rates caused neither a significant reduction of CNR nor a significant increase in artifact diameter or blurring of the needle profile. The application of keyhole imaging with update rates of greater than 15% is sufficient for the MR guidance of interventions with an signal-to-noise ratio  >9 of the surrounding tissue and a target accuracy of >1 mm. Keyhole imaging can increase temporal resolution while ensuring unimpaired spatial resolution and image quality of the depicted instrument.	blurred vision;centimeter per second;contrast-to-noise ratio;diameter (qualifier value);experiment;fill;gradient;image quality;imagery;instrument - device;magnetic resonance imaging;magnetic resonance imaging, interventional;movement;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;puncture procedure;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;signal-to-noise ratio;tesla - unit;transverse wave;velocity (software development)	Jens Christian Rump;Martin Jonczyk;Christian Jürgen Seebauer;Florian Streitparth;Felix Victor Güttler;Ulf Karl-Martin Teichgräber;Bernd Hamm	2011	International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery	10.1007/s11548-011-0554-8	radiology;medicine;interventional magnetic resonance imaging;nuclear medicine;medical physics	Vision	45.117304814845696	-83.20158960399974	169600

Variations within optical sensor system height-maps show that noise amounts to 100 microns on snapshots of smooth body surfaces. It is not increased by image processing software removing triangulation spot artefacts. Presence of hairs on a body surface degrades the image quality, but still within tolerance (800 microns, typically the size of in-slice CT pixel). The accuracy of the system is 150 microns, the repeatibility 300 microns; 'off-surface' points should however be masked. Feasibility of dynamic 3D imaging of a body surface is demonstrated. Visualisation and analysis of the entire chest surface movement during breathing is achieved using the optical sensor system. Such monitoring and quantification of patient movement is directly relevant to gated radiotherapy and post-treatment verifications. Analysis of surface movement (height variations over time) in terms of mean and standard deviation should also be included in patient set-up procedures before radiotherapy treatment.	image analysis	V.

117adaf797c3cbd7a9476a54740bc9ec64176f87	stereoscopic augmented reality using ultrasound volume rendering for laparoscopic surgery in children	volume rendering;transducers;visualization;scanners;surgery;ultrasonography;augmented reality;video;scanning;radiation	In laparoscopic surgery, live video provides visualization of the exposed organ surfaces in the surgical field, but is unable to show internal structures beneath those surfaces. The laparoscopic ultrasound is often used to visualize the internal structures, but its use is limited to intermittent confirmation because of the need for an extra hand to maneuver the ultrasound probe. Other limitations of using ultrasound are the difficulty of interpretation and the need for an extra port. The size of the ultrasound transducer may also be too large for its usage in small children. In this paper, we report on an augmented reality (AR) visualization system that features continuous hands-free volumetric ultrasound scanning of the surgical anatomy and video imaging from a stereoscopic laparoscope. The acquisition of volumetric ultrasound image is realized by precisely controlling a back-and-forth movement of an ultrasound transducer mounted on a linear slider. Furthermore, the ultrasound volume is refreshed several times per minute. This scanner will sit outside of the body in the envisioned use scenario and could be even integrated into the operating table. An overlay of the maximum intensity projection (MIP) of ultrasound volume on the laparoscopic stereo video through geometric transformations features an AR visualization system particularly suitable for children, because ultrasound is radiation-free and provides higher-quality images in small patients. The proposed AR representation promises to be better than the AR representation using ultrasound slice data.	augmented reality;maximum intensity projection;medical ultrasound;preclinical imaging;stereoscopy;transducer;volume rendering;volumetric display	Jihun Oh;Xin Kang;Emmanuel Wilson;Craig A.

Three-dimensional locations of the implanted radioactive seeds can be calculated from multiple X-ray images upon resolving the correspondence of seeds. This is usually modeled as an assignment problem that is NP-hard. We propose an algorithm that allows us to derive an equivalent problem of reduced dimensionality based on practical observation that the optimal solution has almost zero cost if the C-arm pose is known. The reduced problem is efficiently solved by linear programming in polynomial time. Additionally, our method solves the hidden seeds problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the implanted seeds can be localized with a matching rate of ≥ 98.8 % and reconstruction error of ≤ 0.37 mm using three images with hidden seeds in a few seconds when the pose of the C-arm is known.	arabic numeral 0;assignment problem;brachytherapy;diagnostic radiologic examination;hidden markov model;implants;linear programming;matching;np-hardness;partial;plant seeds;radioactivity;radiometry;simulation;time complexity;x-ray (amazon kindle);algorithm	Junghoon Lee;Christian Labat;Ameet K.

82b105e26cba7d4fdf0293d862a1e289446eaf2c	an ultrasound-based navigation system for minimally invasive neck surgery.		Future minimally invasive neck surgery requires a navigation system adapted to the actual intra-operative bedding of the patient. The detection of the bedding-caused tissue shift is essential for a safe orientation for the surgeon new endoscopic operation procedures in neck surgery. It is essential to visualize the relation between important anatomic landmarks and operation instruments at any time. Within the scientific project SACAS we focus on developing an ultrasound supported navigation system based on preoperative imaging which considers the intra-operative tissue shift. A rotatable, flexible neck-model provides the basis for our analysis to evaluate the tissue shift and to invent the new navigation system for endoscopic neck surgery. The total registration error of the system was 2 mm.

b1d526e8ef72eb1f563a9543f3170d1009e52334	a navigation platform for guidance of beating heart transapical mitral valve repair	mitral valve repair;image guided surgery	Traditional surgical approaches for repairing diseased mitral valves (MVs) have relied on placing the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass (on pump), stopping the heart and accessing the arrested heart directly. However, because this approach has the potential for adverse neurological, vascular, and immunological sequelae, less invasive beating heart alternatives are desirable. Emerging beating heart techniques have been developed to offer high-risk patients MV repair using ultrasound guidance alone without stopping the heart. This paper describes the first porcine trials of the NeoChord DS1000 (Minnetonka, MN), employed to attach neochordae to a MV leaflet using the traditional ultrasound-guided protocol augmented by dynamic virtual geometric models. The distance errors of the tracked tool tip from the intended midline trajectory (5.2 ± 2.4 mm versus 16.8 ± 10.9 mm, p = 0.003), navigation times (16.7 ± 8.0 s versus 92.0 ± 84.5 s, p = 0.004), and total path lengths (225.2 ± 120.3 mm versus 1128.9 ± 931.1 mm, p = 0.003) were significantly shorter in the augmented ultrasound compared to navigation with ultrasound alone,1 indicating a substantial improvement in the safety and simplicity of the procedure.	apex (geometry);leaflet;satellite navigation;tooltip	John Moore;Chris Wedlake;Daniel Bainbridge;Gerard Guiraudon;Michael W.

As a consequence, fitting of growth equations to clinical data is hampered by the small number of available data. On the other hand, characterising the tumor growth kinetics in terms of clinically relevant parameters, such as the doubling time of the tumors, is increasingly required to optimize and personalise treatments. A computational method is presented which can estimate the growth kinetics of tumors from as few as two determinations of its size taken at two successive time points, provided the size at which tumor growth saturates is known. The method is studied by using experimental data obtained in vitro with multicell tumor spheroids and in vivo with tumors grown in mice, and its outputs are compared to those obtained by fitting of experimental data with the Gompertz growth equation. Under certain assumptions and limitations the method provides comparable estimates of the doubling time of tumors with respect to the classical nonlinear fitting approach. The method is then tested against simulated tumor growth trajectories spanning the range of tumor sizes observed in the clinics. The simulations show that a relative classification of tumors on the basis of their growth kinetics can be obtained even if the size at which tumor growth saturates is not known. This result opens the possibility to classify patients bearing fast or slow growing tumors and, hence, to adapt therapeutic regimens under a more rationale basis.	adjudication;biomarkers, tumor;clinical data;design rationale;doubling;estimated;file spanning;gompertz function;kinetics (discipline);kinetics internet protocol;neoplasms;neoplasms, experimental;nonlinear system;patients;simulation;tumor burden;video-in video-out	Roberto Chignola;Roberto Israel Foroni	2005	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2005.845219	biology;medicine;pathology;doubling time;mathematical model;mathematics;biological engineering;immunology;physics;kinetics;statistics;cancer	ML	43.57841896623403	-84.52930242719025	170791

The probe trajectory can instead be estimated from image data, using registration techniques to recover in-plane motion and speckle decorrelation to recover out-of-plane transformations. The relationship between speckle decorrelation and elevational separation is typically represented by a single curve, estimated from calibration data. Distances read off such a curve are corrupted by bias and uncertainty, and only provide an absolute estimate of elevational displacement. This paper presents a probabilistic model of the relationship between correlation measurements and elevational separation. This representation captures the skewed distribution of distance estimates based on high correlations and the uncertainties attached to each measurement. Multiple redundant correlation measurements can then be integrated within a maximum likelihood estimation framework. This paper also introduces a new method based on the traveling salesman problem for resolving sign ambiguities in data sets resulting from nonmonotonic probe motion and frame intersections. Experiments with real and synthetic US data show that by combining these new methods, out-of-plane US probe motion is recovered with improved accuracy over baseline methods using a deterministic model and fewer measurements.	adobe freehand;baseline (configuration management);decorrelation;displacement mapping;distance;estimated;experiment;maximum likelihood estimation;psychologic displacement;statistical model;synthetic intelligence;tracking system;travelling salesman problem;ultrasonography;cell transformation;travel	Catherine Laporte;Tal Arbel	2008	IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging	10.1109/TMI.2008.923704	computer vision;mathematical optimization;computer science;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Vision	50.03227506875851	-86.72740517949268	170815

Our purpose was to develop an accurate automated liver segmentation scheme for measuring liver volumes. We developed an automated volumetry scheme for the liver in CT based on a 5 step schema. First, an anisotropic smoothing filter was applied to portal-venous phase CT images to remove noise while preserving the liver structure, followed by an edge enhancer to enhance the liver boundary. By using the boundary-enhanced image as a speed function, a fastmarching algorithm generated an initial surface that roughly estimated the liver shape. A geodesic-active-contour segmentation algorithm coupled with level-set contour-evolution refined the initial surface so as to more precisely fit the liver boundary. The liver volume was calculated based on the refined liver surface. Hepatic CT scans of eighteen prospective liver donors were obtained under a liver transplant protocol with a multi-detector CT system. Automated liver volumes obtained were compared with those manually traced by a radiologist, used as """"gold standard."""" The mean liver volume obtained with our scheme was 1,520 cc, whereas the mean manual volume was 1,486 cc, with the mean absolute difference of 104 cc (7.0%). CT liver volumetrics based on an automated scheme agreed excellently with """"goldstandard"""" manual volumetrics (intra-class correlation coefficient was 0.95) with no statistically significant difference (p(F≤f)=0.32), and required substantially less completion time. Our automated scheme provides an efficient and accurate way of measuring liver volumes.© (2010) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

e67cddd46135530fc27c659d226a71ff69ae1850	joint deformable liver registration and bias field correction for mr-guided hdr brachytherapy	deformable registration;bias field correction;magnetic resonance imaging;liver intervention;high-dose rate brachytherapy	In interstitial high-dose rate brachytherapy, liver cancer is treated by internal radiation, requiring percutaneous placement of applicators within or close to the tumor. To maximize utility, the optimal applicator configuration is pre-planned on magnetic resonance images. The pre-planned configuration is then implemented via a magnetic resonance-guided intervention. Mapping the pre-planning information onto interventional data would reduce the radiologist’s cognitive load during the intervention and could possibly minimize discrepancies between optimally pre-planned and actually placed applicators. We propose a fast and robust two-step registration framework suitable for interventional settings: first, we utilize a multi-resolution rigid registration to correct for differences in patient positioning (rotation and translation). Second, we employ a novel iterative approach alternating between bias field correction and Markov random field deformable registration in a multi-resolution framework to compensate for non-rigid movements of the liver, the tumors and the organs at risk. In contrast to existing pre-correction methods, our multi-resolution scheme can recover bias field artifacts of different extents at marginal computational costs. We compared our approach to deformable registration via B-splines, demons and the SyN method on 22 registration tasks from eleven patients. Results showed that our approach is more accurate than the contenders for liver as well as for tumor tissues. We yield average liver volume overlaps of 94.0 ± 2.7% and average surface-to-surface distances of 2.02 ± 0.87 mm and 3.55 ± 2.19 mm for liver and tumor tissue, respectively. The reported distances are close to (or even below) the slice spacing (2.5 – 3.0 mm) of our data. Our approach is also the fastest, taking 35.8 ± 12.8 s per task. The presented approach is sufficiently accurate to map information available from brachytherapy pre-planning onto interventional data. It is also reasonably fast, providing a starting point for computer-aidance during intervention.	algorithmic efficiency;applicator - device;b-spline;biologic preservation;biomarkers, tumor;body tissue;computation;declaration (computer programming);distance;fastest;fiducial marker;interstitial webpage;iterative method;könig's lemma;liver and intrahepatic biliary tract carcinoma;magnetic resonance imaging;manuscripts;marginal model;markov chain;markov random field;morphologic artifacts;muscle rigidity;neoplasms;numerous;organ;patients;preprocessor;radiology;reticulate acropigmentation of kitamura;revision procedure;tumor volume;voxel;biologic segmentation;high dose rate brachytherapy;registration - actclass;standards characteristics;tumor tissue	Marko Rak;Tim König;Klaus D.

Accurate haptic feedback is needed for developing improved surgical simulators and trainers for such procedures. In prostate brachytherapy, accurate needle placement of radioactive seeds in the prostate is crucial to the success of the surgery and to the quality of life of the patient. Therefore, a trainer or simulator for this and other types of needle insertion tasks require an accurate reality-based quantification and model of the needle and soft tissue interaction. To achieve this, we utilize the X-ray images produced by a dual C-arm fluoroscope setup during a needle insertion task to obtain parameters needed for accurate modeling of soft tissue and needle interactions. The needle and implanted markers in the tissue are tracked during the insertion and withdrawal of the needle at speeds of 1.016 mm/sec, 12.7 mm/sec and 25.4 mm/sec. Both image and force data are utilized to determine important parameters such as the local effective modulus during puncture and the approximate cutting force for soft tissue samples.

A complete closure of all anastomoses is a prerequisite for the success of the therapy, but the small field of view of the fetoscope makes it difficult for the surgeon to properly locate all the anastomoses. This problem can be overcome by creating a complete image of the placental surface during fetoscopy. In this paper, we present a novel approach for placenta image mosaicing. We evaluate a recently developed interest point detection and feature description method needed to automatically fuse the poor quality fetoscopic images. Moreover, an efficient scheme to improve the accuracy of the mosaic is presented.	algorithm;interest point detection;speeded up robust features	Mireille Reeff;Friederike Gerhard;Philippe C.

For this, an important preprocessing step is the separation of neighboring vertebrae. We introduce a method to compute planes separating the individual vertebrae of the spine. For that purpose, a virtual balloon is inflated within the vertebral canal. After inflation, the balloon graphically shows swellings at the intervertebral regions and necks in the vertebra regions which can be distinguished by Gaussian curvature analysis on the balloon surface. Planes are constructed in the intervertebral regions separating the individual vertebrae. First tests have shown that our methods can be adapted to vertebra separation even in MRT volume data.	preprocessor;vertebra	Matthias Hahn;Thomas Beth	2004	Proceedings. 17th IEEE Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems	10.1109/CBMS.2004.1311733	gaussian curvature;radiology;spine;medicine;computer science;gaussian process;irrigation;image segmentation;computed tomography;system testing;anatomy;surgery;statistics	Visualization	39.66481752207897	-80.48046909802304	171880

We develop sufficient conditions on the interfering reference wave for exact phase reconstruction in the absence of noise and propose a noniterative phase reconstruction technique. We show that the zero-order artifact, a commonly encountered problem in QPM, can be completely suppressed by the proposed reconstruction technique. The theoretical guarantees pertain to continuous-domain object functions with the additional assumption of being bandlimited. We present results on synthesized phase objects that are effectively bandlimited to show that the proposed method is capable of recovering the phase acurately. In cases of images where the phase exhibits large excursions, unwrapping becomes necessary, for which we employ Goldstein's phase unwrapping algorithm.	algorithm;bandlimiting;domain-driven design;instantaneous phase	Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula;Basty Ajay Shenoy;Séverine Coquoz;Theo Lasser	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	10.1109/ICIP.2014.7025799	computer vision;mathematics;phase retrieval	Vision	48.54512508486246	-84.39975065330896	171910

Drawbacks of fluoroscopic guidance are the fact that the presented images are 2D projections and that both the patient and the clinician are exposed to radiation. Image-guided navigation using pre-interventionally acquired 3D MR or CT data is an alternative. However, this often requires invasive anatomical landmark-based, marker-based or surface-based image-to-patient registration. In this paper, a coupling between an image-guided navigation system and an intraoperative C-arm X-ray device with 3D imaging capabilities (3D rotational X-ray (3DRX) system) that enables direct navigation without invasive image-to-patient registration on 3DRX volumes, is described and evaluated. The coupling is established in a one-time preoperative calibration procedure. The individual steps in the registration procedure are explained and evaluated. The acquired navigation accuracy using this coupling is approximately one millimeter.	3d reconstruction;calibration;direct navigation;intervention;magnetic resonance imaging;patients;projections and predictions;millimeter	Everine B. van de Kraats;Theo van Walsum;Lance Kendrick;Niels J.

578d4675a4f15de230a91a468b953c58ac0c1a8a	high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging and tractography of the human optic chiasm at 9.4 t	high resolution;diffusion tensor images;partial volume;microstructures;diffusion model;optic nerve;diffusion tensor;spatial resolution	The optic chiasm with its complex fiber micro-structure is a challenge for diffusion tensor models and tractography methods. Likewise, it is an ideal candidate for evaluation of diffusion tensor imaging tractography approaches in resolving inter-regional connectivity because the macroscopic connectivity of the optic chiasm is well known. Here, high-resolution (156 microm in-plane) diffusion tensor imaging of the human optic chiasm was performed ex vivo at ultra-high field (9.4 T). Estimated diffusion tensors at this high resolution were able to capture complex fiber configurations such as sharp curves, and convergence and divergence of tracts, but were unable to resolve directions at sites of crossing fibers. Despite the complex microstructure of the fiber paths through the optic chiasm, all known connections could be tracked by a line propagation algorithm. However, fibers crossing from the optic nerve to the contralateral tract were heavily underrepresented, whereas ipsilateral nerve-to-tract connections, as well as tract-to-tract connections, were overrepresented, and erroneous nerve-to-nerve connections were tracked. The effects of spatial resolution and the varying degrees of partial volume averaging of complex fiber architecture on the performance of these methods could be investigated. Errors made by the tractography algorithm at high resolution were shown to increase at lower resolutions closer to those used in vivo. This study shows that increases in resolution, made possible by higher field strengths, improve the accuracy of DTI-based tractography. More generally, post-mortem investigation of fixed tissue samples with diffusion imaging at high field strengths is important in the evaluation of MR-based diffusion models and tractography algorithms.	convergence (action);decussation;diffusion anisotropy;diffusion tensor imaging;eye;image resolution;optic chiasms;optic nerve (gchq);software propagation;tissue fiber;tract (literature);video-in video-out;algorithm	Alard Roebroeck;Ralf Galuske;Elia Formisano;Oriana Chiry;Hansjürgen Bratzke;Itamar Ronen;Dae-Shik Kim;Rainer Goebel	2008	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.08.015	psychology;computer vision;radiology;image resolution;medicine;tractography	Vision	45.27879337599709	-85.59039943216283	172094

Current multidimensional analysis is limited by insufficient temporal resolution of x-ray and magnetic resonance based techniques, but recent improvements in system design holds hope for faster and higher resolution scans to improve images of moving structures allowing more accurate functional studies, such as in the heart. This paper provides a basis for the requisite temporal and spatial resolution for useful imaging during individual segments of the cardiac cycle. Multiple sample rates during systole and diastole are compared to determine an adequate sample frequency to reduce regional myocardial tracking errors. Concurrently, out-of-plane resolution has to be sufficiently high to minimize partial volume effect. Temporal resolution and out-of-plane spatial resolution are related factors that must be considered together. The data used for this study is a DSR dynamic volume image dataset with high temporal and spatial resolution using implanted fiducial markers to track myocardial motion. The results of this study suggest a reduced exposure and scan time for x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging methods, since a lower sample rate during systole is sufficient, whereas the period of rapid filling during diastole requires higher sampling. This could potentially reduce the cost of these procedures and allow higher patient throughput.© (2004) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Acquisition of the images was automatically triggered by detecting the fluorescence signal from the ICG reaching the ocular vasculature. The proprietary detection scheme of the AngioScan allowed to capture both the fundus reflectance image and the ICG fluorescence image simultaneously at any time. The authors sampled image pairs for about four seconds alter the automatic image trigger with frame rates of up to 30 image pairs per second. The images then were processed into a color-coded map depicting the time resolved filling pattern of the eye. In addition, the authors obtained 32 confocal image pairs at different focal planes. Processing the series of fundus reflectance images resulted in a map of retinal surface topography, while the simultaneous fluorescence images were used to calculate the depth of the sub retinal vessels.	image processing	Ulrich P.

They allow the continuous monitoring of patient positioning during image guided therapies using multi-dimensional image registration. Conventional generation of DRRs using spatial domain algorithms such as ray casting is associated with computational complexity of O(N3). Fourier slice theorem is an alternative approach for generating the DRRs in the k-space with reduced time complexity. In this work, we present a high performance, scalable, and optimized DRR generation pipeline on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The strong scaling performance of the presented pipeline is investigated and demonstrated using two contemporary GPUs. Our pipeline is capable of generating DRRs for 5123 volumes in less than a milli-second.	algorithm;cpu (central processing unit of computer system);central processing unit;computational complexity theory;copy (object);deficit round robin;graphics pipeline;graphics processing unit;image registration;image scaling;medical imaging;milli;numerous;plain x-ray;projection-slice theorem;radiography;ray casting;reconstruction filter;scalability;shading;test scaling;therapeutic procedure;time complexity	Marwan Abdellah;Ayman M.

901074356314f7434d605e1166573b1b381bfadc	robust ransac-based blood vessel segmentation	brain;detection and tracking algorithms;complex systems;blood vessels	Many vascular clinical applications require a vessel segmentation process that is able to extract both the centerline and the surface of the blood vessels. However, noise and topology issues (such as kissing vessels) prevent existing algorithm from being able to easily retrieve such a complex system as the brain vasculature. We propose here a new blood vessel tracking algorithm that 1) detects the vessel centerline; 2) provides a local radius estimate; and 3) extracts a dense set of points at the blood vessel surface. This algorithm is based on a RANSAC-based robust fitting of successive cylinders along the vessel. Our method was validated against the Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) algorithm on 10 3DRA patient data of the brain vasculature. Over 744 blood vessels of various sizes were considered for each patient. Our results demonstrated a greater ability of our algorithm to track small, tortuous and touching vessels (96% success rate), compared to MHT (65% success rate). The computed centerline precision was below 1 voxel when compared to MHT. Moreover, our results were obtained with the same set of parameters for all patients and all blood vessels, except for the seed point for each vessel, also necessary for MHT. The proposed algorithm is thereafter able to extract the full intracranial vasculature with little user interaction. 1. DESCRIPTION OF PURPOSE The segmentation of vascular structures is particularly valuable for diagnosis assistance, treatment and surgery planning. A wide range of applications may benefit from an improved blood vessel segmentation process: quantitative studies of pathologies (e.g. stenoses), automated vascular navigation, accurate blood flow computation and computer-based simulations for surgeons education. In such cases, a mere surface depiction is not enough and the extraction of the vessel medial axes is also required. Vascular segmentation has resulted in a vast literature. Many previous works extract the vessel centerline tree, and claim to be robust to the kissing vessel issue: two vessels may happen to be locally tangent, or a vessel may run along a dense structure, e.g. an aneurism or bone. Such works address this issue by using a shape prior. But the downside of this assumption is that the vessel cross-section is circular, which is not always true, especially for large vessels. Thus, a trade-off is usually made between accuracy and robustness. Our work aims at preserving this desired robustness against noise and topology issues while not compromising accuracy on extraction of the vessel surface and its centerline. This paper presents a tracking procedure which builds a vessel tree through successive robust fitting of cylinders to the image. Thereby, our dedicated tracking process: delineates the centerline of the vessel, supplies a local estimation of its radius and robustly extracts dense points on the vessel surface. The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. Our RANSAC-Based Tracking (RBT) algorithm is introduced in Section 2.1. In Section 2.2, we describe the methodology of comparison between our proposal and the Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) algorithm. Section 3 discusses the results produced by both procedures on a data set of 10 patients, and conclusions are presented in Section 4.	algorithm;complex system;computation;image segmentation;mhtml;medial graph;random sample consensus;robustness (computer science);simulation;voxel	Ahmed Yureidini;Erwan Kerrien;Stephane Cotin	2012		10.1117/12.911670	computer vision;complex systems;physics	Vision	40.29635437362822	-82.16356740158041	173277

To date, beamforming yielding TO has mainly been developed for acquisitions performed in linear geometry. However, one of the most important applications of motion estimation is cardiac imaging, which implies acquisition done in sectorial geometry. In this framework, this paper describes a new beamformer design method as well as the corresponding implementation allowing for transverse oscillations for sector scan. The proposed method uses a back-propagation (BP) approach. The performance of this beamformer is quantitatively evaluated through numerical simulations. In particular, we show that the obtained PSF are closer to the expected ones as compared to PSF obtained using the conventional Fraunhofer approximation and the associated Fourier relation.	approximation;backpropagation;beamforming;computer simulation;image formation;motion estimation;neural oscillation;numerical analysis;optic axis of a crystal;software propagation;transverse wave	Xinxin Guo;Denis Friboulet;Hervé Liebgott	2012	2012 9th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)	10.1109/ISBI.2012.6235751	computer simulation;computer vision;computer science;backpropagation;machine learning;mathematics;optics	Robotics	53.330809981029134	-82.61705447503628	173751

Recently, miniaturized agents with shape-changing and gripping capabilities have provided significant advantages in performing grasping, transportation, and manipulation tasks. In order to robustly perform such tasks, it is of utmost importance to properly estimate their overall configuration. This paper presents a novel solution to the problem of estimating and tracking the 3D position, orientation and configuration of the tips of miniaturized grippers from RGB marker-less visual observations obtained by a microscope. We consider this as an optimization problem, seeking for the gripper model parameters that minimize the discrepancy between hypothesized instances of the gripper model and actual observations of the miniaturized gripper. This optimization problem is solved using a variant of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The proposed approach has been evaluated on several image sequences showing the grippers moving, rotating, opening/closing and grasping biological material.	algorithm;closing (morphology);computation;discrepancy function;experiment;graphics processing unit;mathematical optimization;medical ultrasound;modality (human–computer interaction);optimization problem;parallel computing;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;robot end effector;tract (literature)	Stefano Scheggi;ChangKyu Yoon;David H.

These imaging scans may consist of data from magnetic resonance imaging (MR), computed tomography (CT), or other various sources. The challenge in using these different modalities is that the physician must mentally map the two modalities together during the diagnosis and planning phase. Furthermore, the different imaging modalities will be generated at various resolutions as well as slightly different orientations due to patient placement during scans. In this work, we present an interactive system for multimodal data fusion, analysis and visualization. Developed with partners from neurological clinics, this work discusses initial system requirements and physician feedback at the various stages of component development. Finally, we present a novel focus+context technique for the interactive exploration of coregistered multi-modal data. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Accurate motion estimates may lead to improved treatment planning and dose calculation in radiation therapy. However, respiratory motion is difficult to study by conventional X-ray CT imaging since object motion causes inconsistent projection views leading to artifacts in reconstructed images. We propose to estimate the parameters of a nonrigid motion model from a set of projection views of the thorax that are acquired using a slowly rotating cone-beam CT scanner, such as a radiotherapy simulator. We use a conventionally reconstructed 3D thorax image, acquired by breath-hold CT, as a reference volume. We represent respiratory motion using a flexible parametric nonrigid motion model based on B-splines. The motion parameters are estimated by optimizing a regularized cost function that includes the squared error between the measured projection views and the reprojections of the deformed reference image. Preliminary 2D simulation results show that there is good agreement between the estimated motion and the true motion.	b-spline;ct scan;chest;diagnostic radiologic examination;estimated;loss function;morphologic artifacts;motion compensation;motion estimation;pet/ct scan;projections and predictions;scanner device component;simulation	Rongping Zeng;Jeffrey A.

One measure when evaluating non-rigid registration algorithms over the whole of the deformation field is the inverse consistency error, which suggests improved registration quality when the inverse deformation is consistent with the forward deformation. We show that using computed landmark displacements to initialise an intensity based registration reduces the inverse consistency error when using a state-of-the-art non-rigid b-spline registration method. This method aligns prone and supine 2D images derived from CT colonography acquisitions in a cylindrical domain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using the same initialisation also improves registration accuracy for a set of manually identified reference points in cases exhibiting local luminal collapse.	algorithm;b-spline;captcha;ct scan;colon classification;compression artifact;computation;computer-aided design;flowchart;heart rate variability;mathematical optimization;nc (complexity);phantom reference;radiology;shape analysis (digital geometry);spatial variability;tagged architecture;tomography;virtual colonoscopy;xfig	Janne Näppi;Daniele Regge;Hiroyuki Yoshida	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-28557-8		Vision	42.935964983413015	-80.83792689595207	174449

State-of-the-art surgical navigation in OMS still suffers from bulky tracking sensors, troublesome image registration procedures, patient movement, loss of depth perception in visual guidance, and low navigation accuracy. We present an augmented reality navigation system with automatic marker-free image registration using 3-D image overlay and stereo tracking for dental surgery. A customized stereo camera is designed to track both the patient and instrument. Image registration is performed by patient tracking and real-time 3-D contour matching, without requiring any fiducial and reference markers. Real-time autostereoscopic 3-D imaging is implemented with the help of a consumer-level graphics processing unit. The resulting 3-D image of the patient's anatomy is overlaid on the surgical site by a half-silvered mirror using image registration and IP-camera registration to guide the surgeon by exposing hidden critical structures. The 3-D image of the surgical instrument is also overlaid over the real one for an augmented display. The 3-D images present both stereo and motion parallax from which depth perception can be obtained. Experiments were performed to evaluate various aspects of the system; the overall image overlay error of the proposed system was 0.71 mm.	anatomic structures;area striata structure;augmented reality;autostereoscopy;computer graphics;customize;depth perception;experiment;fiducial marker;graphics processing unit;image registration;imagery;mental suffering;navigation;operating room;oral and maxillofacial surgery (qualifier value);order management system;overlay device component;parallax;patients;real-time clock;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;specialty of oral surgery;stereo camera;stereoscopy;surgical instruments;registration - actclass;sensor (device)	Junchen Wang;Hideyuki Suenaga;Kazuto Hoshi;Liangjing Yang;Etsuko Kobayashi;Ichiro Sakuma;Hongen Liao	2014	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2014.2301191	computer vision;augmented reality;medicine;image processing;computer science;image registration;image sensor;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Vision	41.022902427531285	-85.8036932055685	174458

Its surgical repair can be performed via minimally invasive procedures that involve sternum and cartilage relocation and benefit from adequate surgical planning. In this study, we propose a method to estimate the cartilage regions in thoracic CT scans, which is the first step of statistical modeling of the osseous and cartilaginous structures for the rib cage. The ribs and sternum are first segmented by using interactive region growing and removing the vertebral column with morphological operations. The entire chest wall is also segmented to estimate the skin surface. After the segmentation, surface meshes are generated from the volumetric data and the skeleton of the ribs is extracted using surface contraction method. Then the cartilage surface is approximated via contracting the skin surface to the osseous structure. The ribs’ skeleton is projected to the cartilage surface and the cartilages are estimated using cubic interpolation given the joints with the sternum. The final cartilage regions are formed by the cartilage surface inside the convex hull of the estimated cartilages. The method was validated with the CT scans of two pectus excavatum patients and three healthy subjects. The average distance between the estimated cartilage surface and the ground truth is 2.89 mm. The promising results indicate the effectiveness of cartilage surface estimation using the skin surface.	approximation algorithm;ct scan;convex hull;cubic hermite spline;ground truth;interpolation;mathematical morphology;polygon mesh;region growing;relocation (computing);statistical model;straight skeleton	Qian Zhao;Nabile M.

Here we focus on validating not only the geometry of the extracted vascular pattern, but also its function, namely the fluid dynamics. For validating angiographic data, phase contrast angiography (PC-MRA) sequences are used, as these data contain additionally to the morphological data rheological information. This rheological information can be used to validate the reconstructed geometric model of the vascular system, especially for the detection of missing vessels due to velocity changes in front of bifurcations.	geometric modeling;velocity (software development)	Monika Lehmpfuhl;Manuel André Gaudnek;Andreas Hess;Michael Sibila	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-78640-5_71	pathology;anatomy	ML	42.00384156329959	-81.84546802166545	174696

It is usually done by non-linear registration of image scans at different states of the breathing cycle but without further modeling of specific physiological motion properties. In this context, the accurate computation of respiration-driven lung motion is especially challenging because this organ is sliding along the surrounding tissue during the breathing cycle, leading to discontinuities in the motion field. Without considering this property in the registration model, common intensity-based algorithms cause incorrect estimation along the object boundaries. In this paper, we present a model for incorporating slipping motion in image registration. Extending the common diffusion registration by distinguishing between normal- and tangential-directed motion, we are able to estimate slipping motion at the organ boundaries while preventing gaps and ensuring smooth motion fields inside and outside. We further present an algorithm for a fully automatic detection of discontinuities in the motion field, which does not rely on a prior segmentation of the organ. We evaluate the approach for the estimation of lung motion based on 23 inspiration/expiration pairs of thoracic CT images. The results show a visually more plausible motion estimation.

The proposed methods rely on a rigid, normalized mutual-information approach to register one image to another on anatomic structures unaltered by surgery in order to evaluate within-subject changes. After registration, the location and magnitude of changes over time are assessed via graphical overlays and calculation of the Euclidean distances between the surfaces. The resulting 3D graphical display of the magnitude of displacements between two segmentations is color-coded. The direction of displacement is shown by the mean vectors of displacement, within lines that graph connecting points of equal values.

2c5b346418f8d07ee76d3bd4b98ed5879b3282e9	toward lung tumor localization based on strain variability of lung surface during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery		Tumor localization, especially in case of minimally invasive lung tumor resection surgery, is extremely challenging due to the continuous motion of the organ. This motion can be troublesome as it results in spatial discrepancy corresponding to preoperative and intraoperative tumor location. In order to characterize lung tissue stiffness for the purpose of lung tumor localization, in this paper, we present a novel characterization approach based on variability in resistance of the healthy region vs. the tumorous region resulting from lung motion. The proposed approach is numerically validated on a Finite Element (FE) model of the lung with varying surface stiffnesses, where higher stiffness represents tumor and lower stiffness corresponds to healthy lung tissue. The numerical simulation validates the sensitivity of our mechanism for different grades of tumors by demonstrating that the strain on the healthy tissue is 31.8 and 67.1 times higher than that on the tumor surface for a selected relative stiffness variation of 3.6x and 24.4x respectively, at a pressure of 1.6 KPa. Additionally, a framework is developed to validate the proposed approach in a video of a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), where multiple landmarks on the lung surface are tracked. This enables us to quantify the motion of points residing on healthy surface and tumorous surface. The motion data is further analyzed to study the relative surface strain, and it is shown that the proposed approach differentiates a tumor from healthy surface.	computer simulation;contactless smart card;discrepancy function;grade;hand-assisted laparoscopy;heart rate variability;large;lung neoplasms;lung diseases;numerical analysis;spatial variability;structure of parenchyma of lung;surgical procedures, thoracoscopic;thoracic surgery, video-assisted	Nikita Chopra;Chloe O.

X-ray images have poor soft tissue contrast and, for this reason, overlay of static 3-D roadmaps derived from preprocedural volumetric data can be used to add anatomical information. However, the registration between the 3-D roadmap and the 2-D X-ray image can be compromised by patient respiratory motion. Three methods were designed and evaluated to correct for respiratory motion using features in the 2-D X-ray images. The first method is based on tracking either the diaphragm or the heart border using the image intensity in a region of interest. The second method detects the tracheal bifurcation using the generalized Hough transform and a 3-D model derived from 3-D preoperative volumetric data. The third method is based on tracking the coronary sinus (CS) catheter. This method uses blob detection to find all possible catheter electrodes in the X-ray image. A cost function is applied to select one CS catheter from all catheter-like objects. All three methods were applied to X-ray images from 18 patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. The 2-D target registration errors (TRE) at the pulmonary veins were calculated to validate the methods. A TRE of 1.6 mm ± 0.8 mm was achieved for the diaphragm tracking; 1.7 mm ± 0.9 mm for heart border tracking, 1.9 mm ± 1.0 mm for trachea tracking, and 1.8 mm ± 0.9 mm for CS catheter tracking. We present a comprehensive comparison between the techniques in terms of robustness, as computed by tracking errors, and accuracy, as computed by TRE using two independent approaches.	3d modeling;artificial cardiac pacemaker;atrial fibrillation;bifurcation theory;blob detection;cs-blast;coronary sinus structure;diagnostic radiologic examination;diaphragm (acoustics);generalised hough transform;heart atrium;loss function;motion compensation;nih roadmap initiative tag;overlay device component;patients;pulmonary veins;region of interest;tre;trachea;trigonometric tables;x-ray (amazon kindle);electrode;radiofrequency ablation;registration - actclass;soft tissue	YingLiang Ma;Andrew P.

It improves upon existing methods and overcomes most of their intrinsic speed, robustness, and accuracy problems. For speed, we generate Digi- tally Reconstructed Radiographs on small, dynamically selected regions of interest from precomputed ray gray levels in expected viewing direc- tions, and use a multiresolution hierarchy of fluoroscopic X-ray images. For robustness and accuracy, we use a two-step comparison measure: Nor- malized Cross Correlation followed by Variance Weighted Sum of Local Normalized Correlation. To avoid local minima, we use a genetic search method. Our experiments on simulated, in-vitro, and cadaver data show an overall mean Target Registration Error of 0.8mm (max=1.5mm), 95% of the time, computed in 20-100 seconds under realistic conditions.

A relatively long echo time (TE) is typically used for optimal venous contrast. This often leads to a long scan time for high resolution SWI, and can hamper routine clinical applications. Recently, compressed sensing (CS) holds considerable promise to accelerate MRI data acquisition by exploiting signal sparsity. In this study, we investigated feasibility of applying CS to SWI data acquisition to reduce scan time. It was found that CS can achieve reasonably high quality SWI reconstruction using only small fractional k-space coverage.	compressed sensing;data acquisition;display resolution;resonance;swi-prolog;sparse matrix;test engineer	Zhaoyang Jin;Qing-San Xiang;Yiping P.

Rotational angiography is routinely used to determine the 3D geometry and we propose a method to exploit the same acquisition to determine the blood flow waveform and the mean volumetric flow rate. The method uses a model of contrast agent dispersion to determine the flow parameters from the spatial and temporal development of the contrast agent concentration, represented by a flow map. Furthermore, it also overcomes artifacts due to the rotation of the c-arm using a newly introduced reliability map. The method was validated on images from a computer simulation and from a phantom experiment. With a mean error of 11.0% for the mean volumetric flow rate and 15.3% for the blood flow waveform from the phantom experiments, we conclude that the method has the potential to give quantitative estimates of blood flow parameters during cerebrovascular interventions.	blood vessel tissue;cerebrovascular disorders;computer simulation;contrast media;estimated;experiment;flow rate;flow map;galaxy morphological classification;hemodynamics;imaging phantom;morphologic artifacts;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;quantitation;rotational angiography;x-ray image intensifier;angiogram	Irina Wächter-Stehle;Jörg Bredno;Dean C.

Conductivity tensor is a simplified model to express the effective electrical anisotropic information and depends on the imaging resolution. The determination of the conductivity tensor should be based on Ohm's law. In other words, the measurement of partial information of current density and the electric fields should be made. Since the direct measurements of the electric field and the current density are difficult, we use MRI to measure their partial information such as B1 map; it measures circulating current density and circulating electric field. In this work, the ratio of the two circulating fields, termed circulating admittivity, is proposed as measures of the conductivity anisotropy at Larmor frequency. Given eigenvectors of the conductivity tensor, quantitative measurement of the eigenvalues can be achieved from circulating admittivity for special tissue models. Without eigenvectors, qualitative information of anisotropy still can be acquired from circulating admittivity. The limitation of the circulating admittivity is that at least two components of the magnetic fields should be measured to capture anisotropic information.	anisotropy;map;muscle;nerve;ohm's law;electric field	Joonsung Lee;Yizhuang Song;Narae Choi;Sungmin Cho;Jin Keun Seo;Dong-Hyun Kim	2013		10.1155/2013/421619	computer simulation;radiology;medicine;magnetic resonance imaging;nuclear magnetic resonance;electrical resistivity and conductivity;anisotropy	Vision	45.24412494856918	-85.59207617316456	176855

Its purpose is to find a geometrical transformation that relates the points of an image to their corresponding points of another image. Many registration algorithms have been proposed in the past decade. We present a fast, fully automatic algorithm that is capable of solving rigid-body registration of 3D images of the human brain where the images are taken by different imaging devices. We joined the Retrospective Registration Evaluation Project conducted by Vanderbilt University, USA. The evaluations of our results show that our method has the potential to produce satisfactory results, but visual inspection is necessary to guard against large errors.	algorithm;image registration;mutual information	Attila Tanács;Attila Kuba	2003	Acta Cybern.		stereoscopy;computer vision;rigid body;image processing;computer science;image registration;theoretical computer science;mathematics;mutual information;statistics;computer graphics (images);visual inspection	Vision	41.59795482466259	-83.08516854946889	176912

Computer-aided method for producing subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM method) is commonly used. There are two registrations involved in SISCOM: between the ictal-interictal SPECT images, which was shown to be more critical, and between the ictal image and MRI. The aim of this paper is to improve registration accuracy of ictal-interictal registration in SISCOM by registering all three images (ictal, interictal SPECT, MRI) simultaneously. The results of the simulation study demonstrates that, in surface-based registration, triple-registration method results in smaller ictal-interictal SPECT registration error than the pairwise registration method (p<;0.05) for a range of cost-function parameter values.	internationalization and localization;parameter (computer programming);simulation	Erkan U.

2df8a5720085d5e47bf8cd1366abf8fb996d6f56	an automated labeling system for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on mri scans into gyral based regions of interest	intraclass correlation coefficient;clinical trial;magnetic resonance image;region of interest;inter rater reliability;cerebral cortex	In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.	cerebral cortex;cervical atlas;coefficient;inter-rater reliability;mri scans;map;morphometrics;pet/ct scan;region of interest;resonance;scanning;silo (dataset)	Rahul S Desikan;Florent Ségonne;Bruce Fischl;Brian T.

The effect can be reduced by taking the motion into account in the reconstruction algorithm if an estimate of the deformation exists. This paper presents the estimation of the three-dimensional cardiac motion by registering reconstructed images from cardiac quiet phases as a first step towards motion-compensated cardiac image reconstruction. The non-rigid deformations of the heart are parametrized on a coarse grid on the image volume and are interpolated with cubic b-splines. The optimization problem of finding b-spline coefficients that best describe the observed deformations is ill-posed due to the large number of parameters and the resulting motion vector field is sensitive to the choice of initial parameters. Particularly challenging is the task to capture the twisting motion of the heart. The motion vector field from a dynamic computer phantom of the human heart is used to initialize the transformation parameters for the optimization process with realistic starting values. The results are evaluated by comparing the registered images and the obtained motion vector field to the case when the registration is performed without using prior knowledge about the expected cardiac motion. We find that the registered images are similar for both approaches, but the motion vector field obtained from motion estimation initialized with the phantom describes the cardiac contraction and twisting motion more accurately.© (2010) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

fb268c921a97877929bf909d063bacc91ac24fe3	comparison of isometric and anatomical graft placement in synthetic acl reconstructions: a pilot study	isometric insertion points;synthetic ligament;acl reconstruction;knee joint	Correct graft placement is critical to the success of anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions (ACLR). Whilst current trend is to insert the graft in an anatomical location, synthetic grafts have shown to better perform when they are located in an isometric position. Placement, however, is largely dependent on the surgeon and no consensus has been reached for synthetic grafts. Kinematic flexion-extension data of four separate cadaveric knees was obtained using an optical tracking system. Knees were CT-scanned and computer models were developed for each specimen. Three different graft insertion techniques were simulated in each of the computer models. Kinematic data obtained from the optical tracking was applied to the 3D computer models to simulate knee flexion-extension, and virtual change in ACL graft length was measured over the cycle for each insertion technique. Length changes were plotted onto the Radiological-Quadrant. The isometric region on the femur was found to be a band spreading from the mid to deep end of the Blumensaat's line down to the shallow-inferior end of the femoral condyle. The JP Laboureau isometric point technique was consistently located in the isometric zone, with the following coordinates on the Radiographic-Quadrant: t=0.375 (SD 0.0066), h=0.227 (SD 0.0266). The Bernard-Hertel and Charlie Brown anatomical placement methods were located (13%, -6%) and (8%, -15%) away, from the JP Laboureau isometric point, respectively, based on t- and h- coordinates of the Radiographic-Quadrant. This study has determined the isometric region using three-dimensional analysis relative to the Radiographic-Quadrant. The JP Laboureau method best finds the isometric point. This information is useful for synthetic graft placement.

However several important impediments to widespread adoption of this technology remain to be effectively overcome. Here we address two of these impediments: the difficulty of reconstructing electric potentials on the inner (endocardial) as well as outer (epicardial) surfaces of the ventricles, and the need for full anatomical imaging of the subject's thorax to build an accurate subject-specific geometry. We introduce two new features in our reconstruction algorithm: a nonlinear low-order dynamic parameterization derived from the measured body surface signals, and a technique to jointly regularize both surfaces. With these methodological innovations in combination, it is possible to reconstruct endocardial activation from clinically acquired measurements with an imprecise thorax geometry. In particular we test the method using body surface potentials acquired from three subjects during clinical procedures where the subjects' hearts were paced on their endocardia using a catheter device. Our geometric models were constructed using a set of CT scans limited in axial extent to the immediate region near the heart. The catheter system provides a reference location to which we compare our results. We compare our estimates of pacing site localization, in terms of both accuracy and stability, to those reported in a recent clinical publication , where a full set of CT scans were available and only epicardial potentials were reconstructed.	body surface;ct scan;cerebral ventricles;chest;endocardium;estimated;heart;manifold regularization;nonlinear system;ventricular arrhythmia;algorithm;catheter device	Burak Erem;Jaume Coll-Font;Ramon Martinez Orellana;Petr Stovícek;Dana H.

5e8d8816916123cbf9cdc03e2a97f20791fdfe56	including diffusion time dependence in the extra-axonal space improves in vivo estimates of axonal diameter and density in human white matter	steam diffusion mri;axonal density;white matter microstructure;axonal diameters;diffusion time;charmed	Axonal density and diameter are two fundamental properties of brain white matter. Recently, advanced diffusion MRI techniques have made these two parameters accessible in vivo. However, the techniques available to estimate such parameters are still under development. For example, current methods to map axonal diameters capture relative trends over different structures, but consistently over-estimate absolute diameters. Axonal density estimates are more accessible experimentally, but different modeling approaches exist and the impact of the experimental parameters has not been thoroughly quantified, potentially leading to incompatibility of results obtained in different studies using different techniques. Here, we characterise the impact of diffusion time on axonal density and diameter estimates using Monte Carlo simulations and STEAM diffusion MRI at 7 T on 9 healthy volunteers. We show that axonal density and diameter estimates strongly depend on diffusion time, with diameters almost invariably overestimated and density both over and underestimated for some commonly used models. Crucially, we also demonstrate that these biases are reduced when the model accounts for diffusion time dependency in the extra-axonal space. For axonal density estimates, both upward and downward bias in different situations are removed by modeling extra-axonal time-dependence, showing increased accuracy in these estimates. For axonal diameter estimates, we report increased accuracy in ground truth simulations and axonal diameter estimates decreased away from high values given by earlier models and towards known values in the human corpus callosum when modeling extra-axonal time-dependence. Axonal diameter feasibility under both advanced and clinical settings is discussed in the light of the proposed advances.	body of uterus;corpus callosum;dependence;diameter (qualifier value);estimated;experiment;ground truth;monte carlo method;population parameter;simulation;software incompatibility;video-in video-out;white matter;emotional dependency	Silvia De Santis;Derek K.

5993daa139238c00f8b092b0d820e12cfb1ecc97	towards visual matching as a way of transferring pre-operative surgery planning	psi_mic	kuleuven.ac.be Abstract. This paper presents a case study towards intra-operative vi­ sualization of pre-operative medical images and surgery planning infor­ mation. We describe a two stage procedure to provide a surgeon with valuable information during surgery, by augmenting live video with a 3D visualization of surgery planning. A first stage consists of automatic determination of the intrinsic param­ eters of the video camera by means of one image of a calibration object. It comprises an automatic ellipse extraction and a solution to the 2D-3D correspondence problem. With the intrinsic camera parameters known, we perform a second stage to compute the extrinsic camera parameters with respect to the patient under surgery, allowing us to position and visualize the medical images in the right place. Techniques are investigated to visualize and manipulate the pre-operative medical images in order to cope with changes in the surgery scene.

Most implementations therefore restrict the scope of the average to a smaller neighborhood around each pixel, which limits the method's full potential. Here we propose to apply NLM to reduce the noise in fluorescence microscopy image sequences of the beating heart, whose quasi-repeatable pattern produces multiple realizations of similar image patches in different heart beats. We propose to restrict the averaging from the entire sequence to a subset of globally similar frames across multiple heart beats. Using a high-SNR brightfield microscopy image sequence of a beating embryonic zebrafish heart that we artificially corrupt with noise, we illustrate the benefits of selecting non-adjacent frames rather than the immediate temporal neighborhood in the vicinity of the pixel being denoised. The image quality of our NLM approach is also better than that obtained by directly computing the sample median of matching frames over multiple heartbeats, a commonly used method. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our proposed scheme to low-intensity fluorescence images of the embryonic zebrafish heart.	graph (discrete mathematics);image quality;netware loadable module;noise reduction;non-local means;pixel;signal-to-noise ratio	John M.

Experimental measurements were acquired using an imaging system consisting of a parallel plate-imaging chamber and a lens coupled charge coupled device camera, which enables conventional planar imaging as well as fluorescence tomography. To simulate increasing levels of background heterogeneity, we employed phantoms made of a fluorescent tube surrounded by several absorbers in different combinations of absorption distribution. We also investigated the effect of low absorbing thin layers (such as membranes). We show that the normalized Born approach accurately retrieves the position and shape of the fluorochrome even at high background heterogeneity. We also demonstrate that the quantification is relatively insensitive to a varying degree of heterogeneity and background optical properties. Findings are further contrasted to images obtained with the standard Born expansion and with a normalized approach that divides the fluorescent field with excitation measurements through a homogeneous medium.	camera device component;charge-coupled device;excitation;fluorescence;magnetic resonance imaging;merbromin;phantoms, imaging;quantitation;simulation;tissue membrane;anatomical layer;tomography	Antoine Soubret;Jorge Ripoll;Vasilis Ntziachristos	2005	IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging	10.1109/TMI.2005.857213	absorption;three-dimensional space;index term;radiology;fluorescence;molecular imaging;optics;nuclear magnetic resonance;charge-coupled device	Visualization	46.510974484339904	-85.27898717828084	179013

Six parameters are employed to describe the scanner misalignment.

In this paper, we present an image-based system of co-registering these two modalities through real-time tracking of the 3D position and orientation of a moving TEE probe from 2D fluoroscopy images. The 3D pose of the TEE probe is estimated fully automatically using a detection based visual tracking algorithm, followed by intensity-based 3D-to-2D registration refinement. In addition, to provide high reliability for clinical use, the proposed system can automatically recover from tracking failures. The system is validated on over 1900 fluoroscopic images from clinical trial studies, and achieves a success rate of 93.4 % at 2D target registration error (TRE) less than 2.5 mm and an average TRE of 0.86 mm, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness when dealing with poor image quality caused by low radiation dose and pose ambiguity caused by probe self-symmetry.

This method, for the first time, allows the alignment of models of the fetal brain built from magnetic resonance images with 3D fetal brain ultrasound, opening possibilities to develop new, prior information based image analysis methods for 3D fetal neurosonography. The reconstructed magnetic resonance volume is first segmented using a probabilistic atlas and a pseudo ultrasound image volume is simulated from the segmentation. This pseudo ultrasound image is then affinely aligned with clinical ultrasound fetal brain volumes using a robust block-matching approach that can deal with intensity artefacts and missing features in the ultrasound images. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates good performance of the method for our application, in comparison with other tested approaches. The intensity average of 27 ultrasound images co-aligned with the pseudo ultrasound template shows good correlation with anatomy of the fetal brain as seen in the reconstructed magnetic resonance image.	alignment;anatomic structures;atlases;clinical use template;image analysis;morphologic artifacts;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;resonance;biologic segmentation;registration - actclass	Maria Murgasova;Amalia Cifor;Raffaele Napolitano;Aris T Papageorghiou;Gerardine Quaghebeur;Mary A.

It requires the anatomical bladder images be acquired at high spatial resolution and with adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This often leads to a long-time scan (>5 min) and results in image artifacts due to involuntary bladder motion and deformation. In this paper, we investigated an image-processing approach to mitigate the problem of motion and deformation. Instead of a traditional single long-time scan, six repeated short-time scans (each of approximately 1 min) were acquired for the purpose of shifting bladder motion from intrascan into interscans. Then, the interscan motions were addressed by registering the short-time scans to a selected reference and finally forming a single average motion-corrected image. To evaluate the presented approach, three types of images were generated: 1) the motion-corrected image by registration and average of the short-time scans; 2) the directly averaged image of the short-time scans (without motion correction); and 3) the single image of the corresponding long-time scan. Six experts were asked to blindly score these images in terms of two important aspects: 1) the definition of the bladder wall and 2) the overall expression on the image quality. Statistical analysis on the scores suggested that the best result in both the aspects is achieved by the presented motion-corrected average. Furthermore, the superiority of the motion-corrected average over the other two is statistically significant by the measure of a linear mixed-effect model with p-values <; 0.05. Our findings may facilitate the detection of bladder abnormality in MR cystography by mitigating the motion challenge. The effectiveness of this approach depends on the noise level of acquired short-time scans and the robustness of image registration, and future effort on these two aspects is needed.	autostereogram;bladder neoplasm;bladder tissue;cystography;cystoscopy;image processing;image quality;image registration;maxima and minima;mixed model;morphologic artifacts;motion;noise (electronics);resonance;scanning;signal-to-noise ratio;urinary bladder;visual artifact;registration - actclass	Qin Lin;Zhengrong Liang;Chaijie Duan;Jianhua Ma;Haifang Li;C.

ba0ea851f8c17f4b2f233b4c5965d07419c83811	clinically deployed distributed magnetic resonance imaging reconstruction: application to pediatric knee imaging		Magnetic resonance imaging is capable of producing volumetric images without ionizing radiation. Nonetheless, long acquisitions lead to prohibitively long exams. Compressed sensing (CS) can enable faster scanning via sub-sampling with reduced artifacts. However, CS requires significantly higher reconstruction computation, limiting current clinical applications to 2D/3D or limited-resolution dynamic imaging. Here we analyze the practical limitations to T2 Shuffling, a four-dimensional CS-based acquisition, which provides sharp 3D-isotropic-resolution and multi-contrast images in a single scan. Our improvements to the pipeline on a single machine provide a 3x overall reconstruction speedup, which allowed us to add algorithmic changes improving image quality. Using four machines, we achieved additional 2.1x improvement through distributed parallelization. Our solution reduced the reconstruction time in the hospital to 90 seconds on a 4-node cluster, enabling its use clinically. To understand the implications of scaling this application, we simulated running our reconstructions with a multiple scanner setup typical in hospitals.	compressed sensing;computation;computer cluster;dynamic imaging;expect;image quality;image scaling;mathematical optimization;parallel computing;platform for internet content selection;resonance;sampling (signal processing);speedup	Michael J.

7ba41019ac16edf32a112b68eb1a2f87c6629db0	towards cartilage diagnosis in x-ray phase-contrast interferometry		Osteoarthritis is a common cartilage disease, particularly in societies with aging population. Over 80% of the people over 75 years are affected in the USA. MRI and X-ray can be used to image cartilage, but both approaches suffer from specific drawbacks. X-ray Talbot-Lau interferometers (TLI) have the potential to unite benefits from both modalities. However, TLI setups require to be carefully designed for an imaging task, and the design process itself is not yet well understood. In this paper, we present an optimization framework for directly visualizing cartilage in the knee with phase-contrast imaging. First, we create simulated phantoms and make a setup-independent choice for an X-ray spectrum that maximizes the theoretically possible contrast to noise ratio over dose. Then, we analytically adapt a Talbot-Lau interferometer to the best spectrum for a knee phantom. It turns out that cartilage can be visualized with an effective dose of 1.16 mSv.	contrast resolution;contrast-to-noise ratio;effective dose (radiation);mathematical optimization;phantom reference;transport layer interface;x-ray (amazon kindle)	Johannes Bopp;Peter Bartl;Ludwig Ritschl;Marcus Radicke;Andreas K.

Linearization techniques are widely used and require the repeated solution of a linear forward problem. To account correctly for the presence of electrodes and contact impedances, the so-called complete electrode model is applied. Implementing a standard finite element method for this particular forward problem yields a linear system that is symmetric and positive definite and solvable via the conjugate gradient method. However, preconditioners are essential for efficient convergence. Preconditioners based on incomplete factorization methods are commonly used but their performance depends on user-tuned parameters. To avoid this deficiency, we apply black-box algebraic multigrid, using standard commercial and freely available software. The suggested solution scheme dramatically reduces the time cost of solving the forward problem.

df4e4dde501068bc4103ff3429bf8b31d75632fb	3d automatic fiducial marker localization approach for frameless stereotactic neuro-surgery navigation	image processing;morphological operation;navigation system;knowledge base	Although frameless stereotactic neuro-surgical navigation systems are widely used in many neuro-surgical centers around the world, most of the systems still require the user to define the position of fiducial markers manually from patient scans, a procedure that is tedious, time consuming and often inaccurate. Some researchers have addressed this problem, but they acknowledge that their 2D image processing approach has limitation. We propose a new automatic approach for 3D localization of the fiducial markers, which provides higher 3D localization accuracy, and is independent of the geometry of the marker. Our approach includes three steps. First, sets of 3D morphological operations are employed to extract the candidate fiducial markers as the “seeds”. Then a “conditional dilation” technique is employed to reconstruct the regions of fiducials from the “seeds” which are sifted by several knowledge-based rules. Lastly, the intensity-weighted centroid of each extracted fiducial region is calculated as our final fiducial position. The approach is validated by simulated datasets and a CT phantom scan where the average Fiducial Localization Error (FLE) is 0.37mm and 0.31mm, respectively.	algorithm;ct scan;dilation (morphology);fiducial marker;image processing;image registration;mathematical morphology;modality (human–computer interaction);phantom reference;seeds (cellular automaton);trust region	Lixu Gu;Terry M.

A number of methods have been proposed over the years to address this problem but whole body registration of small animals presents special challenges because these images contain many articulated joints and because the animals cannot be easily placed in the same position from acquisition to acquisition. This paper presents a new method for the automatic registration of whole body CT volumes, which consists of two steps. Skeletons are first brought in approximate correspondence with a point-based method. Transformations so obtained are refined with an intensity-based algorithm. The approach has been tested on serial image volumes of a mouse acquired with a micro CT.

In this work, we investigate a 4D reconstruction approach based on an adaptive spatiotemporal smoothing prior, which is used to exploit the common signal component among the different cardiac gates in a sequence. In the experiments, we evaluated this approach with both simulated NCAT imaging data and two sets of clinical acquisitions. The results demonstrate that the proposed 4D approach can be more effective for improving the heart wall in terms of both noise levels and spatial resolution than motion-compensated 4D reconstruction. The proposed approach was also found to be robust for noise suppression when the imaging dose was reduced.	4d reconstruction;ct scan;experiment;smoothing;tomography;zero suppression;netcat	Chao Song;Yongyi Yang;Miles N.

9817caa4351eb3e53de535b7d89f86c4a04facfc	tooth visualization in vowel production mr images for three-dimensional vocal tract modeling		Abstract Teeth are almost invisible in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because they lack free protons to magnetically react. In MRI-based studies on the vocal tract, the teeth must be visualized on the volume data obtained during articulation. To do so, varieties of techniques have been proposed, either covering the teeth by opaque materials or obtaining tooth images followed by their superimposition. In this article, a new method was proposed to visualize the teeth in vowel production MR images for the application of three-dimensional (3D) vocal tract modeling. 3D upper and lower jaw with the teeth was first extracted and reconstructed from static 3D-MRI data acquired during a simple ‘tooth imaging’ posture with minimal time and effort. The extracted 3D jaw with the teeth was superimposed onto the vowel production MRI volume three-dimensionally by using the dental pulps as volume-based landmarks to minimize fitting errors due to varied head positions across the scans. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated not only by the subjective opinions but also by the objective evaluation. The results show that the teeth are successfully and accurately superimposed onto the vowel production MR images. Also, the reconstructed 3D vocal tract models are observed with the bilateral interdental spaces after tooth superimposition. The proposed method solves the MRI-specific problem of the lack of tooth images and contributes to accurate 3D vocal tract measurement and reconstruction.	tract (literature)	Ju Zhang;Kiyoshi Honda	2018	Speech Communication	10.1016/j.specom.2017.11.005	artificial intelligence;vowel;visualization;computer science;superimposition;pattern recognition;vocal tract;magnetic resonance imaging;interdental consonant	HPC	42.97994063665681	-82.96186780523203	182578
af40cce5a8d5bda6057e51d9564eb3c710580323	carotid artery wall motion estimated from ultrasound imaging sequences using a nonlinear state space approach		It is very challenge to investigate the motion of the carotid artery wall in ultrasound images, because of the high nonlinear dynamics of this motion. In our study, the nonlinear dynamics of carotid artery wall motion is first approximated by our nonlinear state-space approach driven by a mathematical model of the mechanical deformation of carotid artery wall. Then, the two-dimensional motion of carotid artery wall is computed by solving the nonlinear state-space approach using the unscented Kalman filter. We have then evaluated the performance of our approach by comparing it with the manual tracing method (the correlation coefficient equals 0.9897 for the radial motion and 0.9703 for the longitudinal motion) and three other state-of-the-art methods for 73 subjects. The results indicate the reliable applicability of our approach in tracking the motion of the carotid artery wall and its potential usefulness in routine clinical diagnosis.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;kalman filter;mathematical model;nonlinear system;radial (radio);state space;the wall street journal	Zhifan Gao;Yuanyuan Sun;Heye Zhang;Dhanjoo N.

859adf8e137b7e22ed14aaca0744fa54161f1d91	revisiting the evaluation of segmentation results: introducing confidence maps	object localization;medical image;map estimation	We introduce a novel framework, called Confidence Maps Estimating True Segmentations (Comets), to store segmentation references for medical images, combine multiple references, and measure the discrepancy between a segmented object and a reference. The core feature is the use of efficiently encoded confidence maps, which reflect the local variations of blur and the presence of nearby objects. Local confidence values are defined from expert user input, and used to define a new discrepancy error measure, aimed to be directly interpreted quantitatively and qualitatively. We illustrate the use of this framework to compare different segmentation methods and tune a method's parameters.	bibliographic reference;discrepancy function;estimated;gaussian blur;iterative method;map;microtubule-associated proteins;segmentation action;true hermaphroditism (disorder);biologic segmentation	Christophe Restif	2007	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

To measure the curative effect of lung nodules, it is necessary to find the corresponding nodules between current and previous CT images. Since the lung shape is deformed by the respiration and posture of the patient, it is difficult to determine the correspondence of nodules automatically on exams of different dates. In the proposed method, the position of each nodule is represented as a relative coordinate in the lung region. The circumscribed quadrangles are set to left and right lung regions, respectively, in axial and coronal sections. The distance from quadrangle origin to nodule center is measured along the direction of x -, y - and z -axis. The nodule position is represented by three components as the ratio of the distance and the length of quadrangle edge in each direction. We applied the method to three chest X-ray CT images that were taken by sequential exams of the same patient. One hundred and eighty-eight pairs (188) of corresponding nodules were checked by visual observation, of which, 175 pairs could be found automatically by the proposed method. Thirteen pairs were false correspondence and the correct correspondence rate was 0.93.

A method was therefore developed for the reconstruction of 3-D heart wall motion directly from tagged magnetic resonance images, without prior identification of ventricular boundaries or tag stripe locations. The method utilized a finite-element model to describe the shape and motion of the heart. Initially, the model geometry was determined at the time of tag creation by fitting a small number of guide points which were placed interactively on the images. Model tags were then created within the model as material surfaces which defined the location of the magnetic tags. An objective function was derived to measure the degree of match between the model tags and the image stripes. The objective was minimized by allowing the model to deform directly under the influence of the images, utilizing an efficient method for calculating image-derived motion constraints. The model deformation could also be manipulated interactively by guide points. Experiments were performed using clinical images of a normal volunteer, as well as simulated images in which the true motion was specified. The root-mean-squared errors between the known and calculated displacement and strain for the simulated images were similar to those obtained using previous stripe-tracking and model-fitting methods. A significant improvement in analysis time was obtained for the normal volunteer and further improvements may allow the method to be applied in a 'real-time' clinical environment.	cardiac wall structure;displacement mapping;image analysis;interactivity;loss function;magnetic stripe card;optimization problem;psychologic displacement;real-time transcription;resonance;stripes;tag (metadata);tracer	Alistair A.

A video workstation was devised containing 2 analog-to-digital video conversion systems: a digital video media converter with fire wire card and a video capture card. A procedure for final digital video production was created that used equivalent compression, pixel resolution, frame rate, and data rate for both systems. A subjective test was performed in which 12 archived analog videotapes, consisting of magnetic resonance angiograms, ultrasounds, neurosurgeries, and telemedicine applications, were converted digitally using the 2 methods. Randomized side by side video comparisons were analyzed and rated by subjective quality. An objective test was performed by videotaping a gray-scale test pattern off a computer monitor, digitally converting it by the 2 methods, and comparing the gray-scale values to the original pattern. There was no significant difference in overall video quality (P=.31) or grayscale reproduction using the 2 methods of analog-to-digital conversion. When performing simple analog-to-digital video conversion, a video capture card is equal in quality and costs less than a digital video (DV) media converter or fire wire card. If a digital video camera is available for use, then a DV media converter or fire wire card is more advantageous because it enables full operation of the digital video camera.	analog;analog-to-digital converter;archive;computer monitor;converter device component;data compression;dienestrol;digital video;education, medical;financial cost;grayscale color map;pixel;randomized algorithm;resonance;science of neurosurgery;tv tuner card;telemedicine;test card;ultrasonography;uncompressed video;video media;video production;workstation;angiogram	Grant Berges;H.

It is the major cause of vision disability in many retinal diseases. Though anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injection has proved to be effective for treating CNV, treatment planning is essential to ensure the efficacy while reducing the risk. For this purpose, we propose a CNV growth model based on longitudinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. The reaction-diffusion model is applied to simulate the growth and shrinkage of CNV volumes, and is solved by using the finite-element method. A fitted curve of the CNV growth/shrinkage rate is obtained by optimizing the growth parameters. Then, the trained parameters are applied to the predicted image to get the simulated image, which is compared with the validated image to evaluate the accuracy of prediction. The proposed method was tested on a dataset with seven patients in which each patient has 12 longitudinal OCT images. The resulted mean dice coefficient is 76.40% ± 8.20%. The experimental results show a promising step towards the image-guided patient-specific treatment.	basal lamina of choroid;blood vessel;choroid plexus papilloma;choroidal neovascularization;copy number polymorphism;endothelial growth factors;finite element method;growth factor;pathologic neovascularization;patients;population dynamics;retina;retinal diseases;seizures;simulation;sørensen–dice coefficient;tissue membrane;tomography, optical coherence;vision disability;tomography	Shuxia Zhu;Fei Shi;Dehui Xiang;Weifang Zhu;Haoyu Chen;Xinjian Chen	2017	IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/JBHI.2017.2702603	vision disability;reaction–diffusion system;neovascularization;sørensen–dice coefficient;computer vision;artificial intelligence;computer science;retinal;choroid;optical coherence tomography	Vision	44.49153685637008	-84.48794270651408	183888

ae8ac85741b32f2997ee7ee7c16c03dde1116d21	ultrasound image-guided mapping of endoscopic views on a 3d placenta model: a tracker-less approach	image mapping;image-guided ultrasound;surgical navigation	This work presents a framework for mapping of free-hand endoscopic views onto 3D anatomical model constructed from ultrasound images without the use of external trackers. It is non-disruptive in terms of existing surgical workflow as surgeons do not need to accommodate operational constraints associated with the use of additionally installed motion sensors or tracking systems. A passive fiducial marker is attached to the tip of the endoscope to create a geometric eccentricity that encodes the position and orientation of the camera. The relative position between the endoscope and the anatomical model under the ultrasound image reference frame is used to establish a texture map that overlays endoscopic views onto the surface of the model. This addresses operational challenges including the limited field-of-view (FOV) and the lack of 3D perspective associated with minimally invasive procedure. Experimental results show that average tool position and orientation errors are 1.32 mm and 1.6o respectively. The R.M.S. error of the overall image mapping obtained based on comparison of dimension of landmarks is 3.30 mm with standard deviation of 2.14 mm. The feasibility of the framework is also demonstrated through implementations on a phantom model. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

07d37d8d5dce852b1bc9f0903ab4165744a4aeb8	development of intravascular ultrasound transducers to monitor chronic total occlusion treatment by microrobots		Chronic total occlusion (CTO) is a completely blocked coronary artery disease. For treatment, surgical procedure for CTO tunneling is generally conducted. The success rate of this procedure relies mainly upon the proficiency of the surgeon. During the surgery, the surgeon is constantly exposed to radioactivity emitted by X-ray based imaging devices such as angiography to locate a surgical wire. To ensure a high surgical success rate without the risk of radiation exposure, a new technology can be devised to perform CTO tunneling using a microrobot controlled by an externally generated magnetic field. To maximize the effectiveness of this new technology, it is essential to identify the components of CTO and the location of the microrobot. This paper reports a recently developed intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) transducer for ultrasound signal-guided CTO tunneling using microrobot. The IVUS transducer was designed and fabricated to enable easy integration with microrobots for CTO tunneling.	medical ultrasound;microbotics;transducer;tunneling protocol	Junsu Lee;Jin Ho Chang	2017	2017 14th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)	10.1109/URAI.2017.7992688	coronary artery disease;intravascular ultrasound;occlusion;ultrasound;biomedical engineering;radiology;angiography;engineering;radiation exposure;transducer	Robotics	39.734417720008956	-85.44597616427919	185716

The correct placement of the prosthetic component in the case of knee replacement is necessary to ensure a correct load distribution and to avoid revision of the implant. 3D reconstruction of the knee kinematics under weight-bearing conditions becomes fundamental to understand existing in vivo loads and improve the joint motion tracking. Existing methods rely on the semiautomatic positioning of a shape previously segmented from a CT or MRI on a sequence of fluoroscopic images acquired during knee flexion. We propose a method based on statistical shape models (SSM) automatically superimposed on a sequence of fluoroscopic datasets. Our method is based on Gaussian mixture models, and the core of the algorithm is the maximization of the likelihood of the association between the projected silhouette and the extracted contour from the fluoroscopy image. We evaluated the algorithm using digitally reconstructed radiographies of both healthy and diseased subjects, with a CT-extracted shape and a SSM as the 3D model. In vivo tests were done with fluoroscopically acquired images and subject-specific CT shapes. The results obtained are in line with the literature, but the computational time is substantially reduced.	3d reconstruction;bone tissue;ct scan;computation;diagnostic radiologic examination;expectation–maximization algorithm;extraction;inverse kinematics;knee replacement arthroplasty (procedure);load balancing (computing);mixture model;normal statistical distribution;projections and predictions;time complexity;video-in video-out;weight-bearing state	Marta Valenti;Giancarlo Ferrigno;Dario Martina;Weimin Yu;Guoyan Zheng;Mohsen Akbari Shandiz;Carolyn Anglin;Elena De Momi	2016	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-016-1460-6	computer vision;engineering;biological engineering;surgery	Vision	41.915781469048945	-81.09862172209802	185935

A rotational scanning using an abdominal probe was employed. To reduce the distortion produced when the rotational axis is not collinear with the central beam of the probe, a new 3D reconstruction algorithm using 360° scanning is derived. Then, a fast 3D needle segmentation algorithm is used to find the electrode direction and determine the tip of electrode.

8240e806cd75bde32402060d232840fec7cfc666	focused registration of tracked 2d us to 3d ct data of the liver		The paper deals with the registration of pre-operative 3DCT-data to tracked intra-operative 2D-US-slices in the context of liver surgery. To bring such a method to clinical practice, it has to be fast and robust. In order to meet these demanding criteria, we propose two strategies. Instead of applying a time-consuming compounding process to obtain a 3D-US image, we use the 2D-slices directly and thereby drastically reduce the complexity and enhance the robustness of the scheme. Naturally, the surgeon does not need the same high resolution for the whole liver. We make use of this fact by applying a focusing technique to regions of special interest. With this, we reduce the overall amount of data to register significantly without sacrificing the accuracy in the ROIs. In contrast to other attempts, the high resolution result in the ROI is combined in a natural way with a global deformation field to obtain a smooth registration of the whole liver. Overall we arrive at a method with a favorable timing. The proposed algorithm was applied to four different patient data-sets and evaluated with respect to the reached vessel-overlap on validation slices. The obtained results are very convincing and will help to bring non-linear registration techniques to the operation theater.	algorithm;image resolution;nonlinear system;region of interest;robustness (computer science)	Janine Olesch;Bernd Fischer	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-19335-4_18	computer vision;simulation;medicine;biological engineering	Vision	44.521839532883995	-82.84369170918183	186184

This can introduce new insight but is problematic to validate due to lack of meaningful ground truth expert measurements. Rather than quantification accuracy, such novel markers must therefore be validated against clinically meaningful end-goals such as the ability to allow correct diagnosis. We present a method for automatic cartilage surface smoothness quantification in the knee joint. The quantification is based on a curvature flow method used on tibial and femoral cartilage compartments resulting from an automatic segmentation scheme. These smoothness estimates are validated for their ability to diagnose osteoarthritis and compared to smoothness estimates based on manual expert segmentations and to conventional cartilage volume quantification. We demonstrate that the fully automatic markers eliminate the time required for radiologist annotations, and in addition provide a diagnostic marker superior to the evaluated semi-manual markers.	ground truth;radiology;semiconductor industry	Sudhakar Tummala;Erik Dam	2010		10.1117/12.844115	smoothness;ground truth;magnetic resonance imaging;biomarker	Vision	40.65387879484538	-80.42631931112103	186369

Here, we present a three-dimensional image analysis method for estimating the fibre orientation and the orientation anisotropy. The proposed method can be applied directly to greyscale volume images and is based on local orientation estimates using quadrature filters and structure tensors. From the tensor field the fibre orientation can be estimated together with a corresponding certainty measurement. Good results are obtained for both synthetic fibre data sets and fibre based materials imaged using X-ray microtomography.	grayscale;image analysis;synthetic data;x-ray microtomography;curl	Maria Axelsson	2008	2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition	10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761631	magnetoresistance;computer vision;image processing;computer science;optical fiber;stress	Vision	46.327808872097094	-85.86079195919586	186602

Manual analysis of IVUS images is slow and time-consuming and it is not feasible for clinical purposes. A semi-automated method is proposed to generate 3D reconstructions from IVUS video sequences, so that a fast diagnose can be easily done, quantifying plaque length and severity as well as plaque volume of the vessels under study. The methodology described in this work has four steps: a pre-processing of IVUS images, a segmentation of media-adventitia contour, a detection of intima and plaque and a 3D reconstruction of the vessel. Preprocessing is intended to remove noise from the images without blurring the edges. Segmentation of media-adventitia contour is achieved using active contours (snakes). In particular, we use the gradient vector flow (GVF) as external force for the snakes. The detection of lumen border is obtained taking into account gray-level information of the inner part of the previously detected contours. A knowledge-based approach is used to determine which level of gray corresponds statistically to the different regions of interest: intima, plaque and lumen. The catheter region is automatically discarded. An estimate of plaque type is also given. Finally, 3D reconstruction of all detected regions is made. The suitability of this methodology has been verified for the analysis and visualization of plaque length, stenosis severity, automatic detection of the most problematic regions, calculus of plaque volumes and a preliminary estimation of plaque type obtaining for automatic measures of lumen and vessel area an average error smaller than 1mm(2) (equivalent aproximately to 10% of the average measure), for calculus of plaque and lumen volume errors smaller than 0.5mm(3) (equivalent approximately to 20% of the average measure) and for plaque type estimates a mismatch of less than 8% in the analysed frames.	3d reconstruction from multiple images;adventitia;blood vessel tissue;blurred vision;calculi;coronary angiography;dental plaque;estimated;frame (physical object);gradient;image noise;imagery;intravascular ultrasound;knowledge-based systems;plain x-ray;preprocessor;region of interest;semiconductor industry;senile plaques;small;snakes;structure of lumen of body system;units of measure - lumen;angiogram;biologic segmentation	Roberto Sanz-Requena;David Moratal;Diego Ramón García-Sánchez;Vicente Bodí;José Joaquín Rieta;Juan Manuel Sanchis	2007	Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society	10.1016/j.compmedimag.2006.11.004	3d reconstruction;computer vision;knowledge base;radiology;pathology;computer science;active contour model;mathematics;region of interest	Vision	39.739039494375504	-80.41104050857618	187177

Over the last decade, this technique has become an important clinical tool for detection of tumors, follow-up treatment and drug research, providing an understanding of dynamic physiological processes. Since PET needs improved reconstruction algorithms to facilitate clinical diagnosis, we will investigate an improved iterative algorithm. Amongst current algorithms applied for PET reconstruction, ART was first proposed as a method of reconstruction from CT projections. With appropriate tuning, the convergence of these algorithms could be very fast indeed. However, the quality of reconstruction using these methods has not been thoroughly investigated. We study a variant of these algorithms. We present the state of the art, review well-known ART and investigate an optimum dynamically-changing block structure for the not yet fully explored variable-Block ART, which uses jointly the Inter-Update Metz filter for regularization and exploits the full symmetries in PET scanners. This reveals significant acceleration of initial convergence to an acceptable reconstruction of inconsistent cases. To assess the quality and analyze any discrepancy of the reconstructed images, two figures of merit (FOMs) are used to evaluate two 3D Data phantoms acquired on a GEAdvance scanner for high statistics.	algorithm;ct scan;cross-sectional data;discrepancy function;iterative method;polyethylene terephthalate;tomography	Mustapha Sadki;Maite Trujillo San-Martin	2005		10.1117/12.587631	iterative reconstruction;engineering;biological engineering;nuclear medicine;medical physics	AI	46.07785004468802	-83.57625949172585	187328

006fa607ac82a01c152a07821db1145bb06dfadf	enhanced cas in head and neck-surgery: evaluation of intraoperative data modality imri and sonography	enhanced cas;sonography;neurosurgery;intraoperative imaging;head and neck-surgery;imri;high resolution;point to point;mutual information;image quality;neuronal network;interventional mri;real time;ultrasound	Purpose: Computer-assisted surgical procedures are well established in head/neck- and neurosurgery. Most systems are based on preoperative CT or MR data. To visualize the surgical change and re-registration, there is a need for intraoperative imaging. Currently, only few imaging methods are available to supply up-to-date information on the surgical progress, e.g., inter-/intraoperative MRI, interoperative CT, and sonography/ultrasound. The purpose of this study is to compare procedures and algorithms for intraoperative co-registration of iMRI and sonography in head/neck- and neurosurgery. Methods: Intraoperative imaging was performed by interventional MR (GE Signa SP) and high-resolution ultrasound (Siemens Sienna). iMRI: Localite Navigator Software (enhanced CAS) allows integration of preoperative data to intraoperative imaging of MR, fMR and CT. The co-registration was based on fiducial markers. The implementation was designed as a multimode real-time navigation system supplying images of bony structures/contours (derived from CT data) fused into real-time MR images. A total of 10 markers (three forehead, three temporal scalp, three mastoid, and one occipital scalp) were used in this study to define reproducible fixation points. Sonography: Based on neuronal networks, a recognize-algorithm for co-registration was developed using sonography data sets of the neck. Results: The statistical point-to-point accuracy (marker difference) of co-registration in the open MR was determined to be 1.2±0.1 mm. The co-registration CT preop and iMRI are reliable and nowadays established in selected surgical procedures of the skull base, e.g., biopsy of the petroclival region. The system yields a significantly better image quality and higher repetition rate than the standard real-time images. Typical for any marker-based registration, the matching accuracy for the registered data sets depends on the accuracy of locating the markers in the respective images, and the inherent displacement of the fiducial markers. The markerless co-registration Sono preop /Sono intraop based on neuronal networks is still less reliable with a positive recognition rate of 46/51 of structures with a maximal volume of 2.110 cm 3 . Recognized structures can be used for co-registration with different data modalities, e.g., MR, CT or for single-modality navigation. Conclusions: Both interventional MRI as well as sonography allows intraoperative data update. The marker-based co-registration CT preop /iMRI is still more reliable than Sono preop /Sono intraop based on neuronal networks. Further developments tend towards the improvement of mutual information algorithm and marker-like landmarks to improve the recognition rate of integrated sonography. Low costs and less surgical tools expenditure are the advantages of sonography, and it will be a serious possibility for intraoperative CAS-update. Otherwise, the study demonstrates the possibility of combining intraoperative MR and sonography with other modalities for enhanced CAS in ORL and neurosurgery.	medical ultrasound;modality (human–computer interaction)	Gero Strauß;Christos Trantakis;Dirk Winkler;Tina Geweniger;Martin Bublat;T.

In this study, using Cine MRI images, the infarct region was precisely determined by examining the local migration path length of critical points on myocardium borders and the fractional thickening effects. First, MRI Cine images of Epi/Endocardium were processed in 3D for all slices, and then incorporated in all frames to build a dynamic model. Epi/Endocardium images were segmented using Heiberg algorithm, and then by a robust restricted block matching algorithm, the sparse points were tracked. Finally, by fitting a 3D active mesh model to the sparse point displacements, a dense motion field was obtained, and some useful local parameters of left ventricle in patients with myocardial infarction were estimated. The local parameters are path length, fractional thickening, and strain. Using this process, the cardiac wall motion was quantized to determine the region and extent of infarct lesion. The process was implemented, and the results were examined and modified against the cardiac perfusion scan. Data were acquired from 10 healthy individuals and 20 patients with the myocardial infarction. The findings also reveal that the infarct region can be determined by locating less than 20% in the wall thickening. In all the patients, the process was able to precisely determine the affected region. The cardiac wall kinesis in damaged regions was properly evaluated by normalized path length and presented in standard bull's-eye format. The above approach is promising and can be extended in prognosis of acute heart infraction by prediction of prone to the wall kinesis regions in the patients close to MI by examining the local indexes of the myocardium in the cardiac MRI images.

The standard method for excluding the scatter component in pixelized scintillators is the application of an energy window around the central photopeak channel of each crystal cell, but small angle scattered photons still appear in the photopeak window, and they are included in the reconstructed images. A number of scatter correction techniques have been proposed in order to estimate the scatter component, but they have not yet been applied in pixelized scintillators, where most groups use the standard one-photopeak window for scatter correction. In this paper, the author have assessed three subtraction techniques that use a different approach in order to calculate the scatter component and subtract it from the photopeak image: the dual energy window subtraction technique, the convolution subtraction technique, and a deconvolution technique.

Several published reports indicate that from 10% to 15% of images are rejected from studies due to image quality. With the transition of retinal photography to lesser trained individuals in clinics, image quality will suffer unless there is a means to assess the quality of an image in real-time and give the photographer recommendations for correcting technical errors in the acquisition of the photograph. The purpose of this research was to develop and test a methodology for evaluating a digital image from a fundus camera in real-time and giving the operator feedback as to the quality of the image. By providing real-time feedback to the photographer, corrective actions can be taken and loss of data or inconvenience to the patient eliminated. The methodology was tested against image quality as perceived by the ophthalmologist. We successfully applied our methodology on over 2,000 images from four different cameras acquired through dilated and undilated imaging conditions. We showed that the technique was equally effective on uncompressed and compressed (JPEG) images. We achieved a 100 percent sensitivity and 96 percent specificity in identifying “rejected” images.	data compression;digital image;image processing;image quality;jpeg;mike lesser;real-time clock;real-time locating system;sensitivity and specificity;usability	Herbert Davis;Stephen R.

Its ability to track prostate motion intraoperatively allows it to manage motions and guide needles to predefined targets.   MATERIALS AND METHODS A robotic system was created for transrectal ultrasound guided needle implantation combined with intraoperative prostate tracking. Experiments were done on 90 targets embedded in a total of 9 mobile, deformable, synthetic prostate phantoms. Experiments involved trying to insert glass beads as close as possible to targets in multimodal anthropomorphic imaging phantoms. Results were measured by segmenting the inserted beads in computerized tomography volumes of the phantoms.   RESULTS The robot reached the chosen targets in phantoms with a median accuracy of 2.73 mm and a median prostate motion of 5.46 mm. Accuracy was better at the apex than at the base (2.28 vs 3.83 mm, p <0.001), and similar for horizontal and angled needle inclinations (2.7 vs 2.82 mm, p = 0.18).   CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge this robot for prostate focal therapy, brachytherapy and targeted prostate biopsies is the first system to use intraoperative prostate motion tracking to guide needles into the prostate. Preliminary experiments show its ability to reach targets despite prostate motion.	apex1 protein, human;apex (geometry);bead dosage form;biopsy;brachytherapy;ct scan;clinical act of insertion;embedded system;embedding;experiment;focal (programming language);gvax prostate cancer vaccine;ion implantation;multimodal interaction;needle device;phantoms, imaging;robot;synthetic data;x-ray computed tomography;transrectal ultrasound	Jean-Alexandre Long;Nikolai Hungr;Michael Baumann;Jean-Luc Descotes;Michel Bolla;Jean-Yves Giraud;Jean-Jacques Rambeaud;Jocelyne Troccaz	2012	The Journal of urology	10.1016/j.juro.2012.06.003	three-dimensional space;haplogroup ct;radiology;medicine;pathology;magnetic resonance imaging;ultrasound;medical physics	Robotics	40.015329737915025	-84.79434346427207	189282

It includes two solid and flexible samples of reference materials, each having a substantially uniform density, and a solid and flexible encasement surrounding the samples of reference material.

The approach was based on vertebral contour matching for estimating vertebral orientations and locations. Vertebral primitives were initially positioned under constraint of the 3-D spine midline, which was estimated from manually identified control points. Vertebral orientations and locations were automatically adjusted by matching projections of 3-D primitives with vertebral edges on biplanar radiographs based on the generalized Hough transform technique with a deformation tolerant matching strategy. We used graphics processing unit to accelerate reconstruction. Accuracy and precision were evaluated using radiographs from 15 scoliotic patients and a spine model in 24 poses. On in vivo radiographs, accuracy was within 2.8° for orientation and 2.4 mm for location; precision was within 2.3° for orientation and 2.1 mm for location. results were slightly better on model radiographs than on in vivo radiographs but without significance (p > 0.05). The duration for user intervention was less than 2 min, and the computation time was within 3 min. Results indicated the method's reliability. It is a promising tool to determine 3-D spinal geometry with acceptable user interaction.	bone structure of spine;computation (action);computer graphics;contour line;estimated;generalised hough transform;graphics processing unit;maxima and minima;mental orientation;multistage interconnection networks;orientation (graph theory);patients;pattern matching;projections and predictions;radiography;reliability engineering;scoliosis, unspecified;time complexity;video-in video-out	Junhua Zhang;Liang Lv;Xinling Shi;Yuanyuan Wang;Fei Guo;Yufeng Zhang;Hongjian Li	2013	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2013.2246788	iterative reconstruction;computer vision;radiography;radiology;medicine;engineering;biomechanics;reliability;engineering drawing	Visualization	40.34489468594995	-81.17274464856366	189610

A parametric method is presented to register a FS mammogram and a FFD mammogram of the same woman with respect to geometry and gray-scales. The main motivation for the study is to lessen irrelevant differences between mammograms due to acquisition. First, a technique like this might increase the radiologist's ability to detect relevant differences like abnormal growth in breast tissue that signal breast cancer. Second, applications may be found in subtraction radiology or in computer-aided detection of abnormalities in temporal mammograms. The proposed method is based on a parametric model of the most important aspects of acquisition, which relates the pixel values of two images. This encompasses (1) breast positioning; (2) breast compression; (3) exposure time; (4) incident radiation intensity; and (5a) film properties and digitization for FS mammograms, or (5b) detector response for FFD mammograms. The method does not require a priori knowledge about specific settings of acquisition; the parameters are estimated from the two mammograms themselves.	compression;congenital abnormality;detectors;diagnostic radiologic examination;digital dermatitis;free-form deformation;grayscale;image formation;mammary gland parenchyma;mammary neoplasms;maxillary right first premolar abutment;parametric model;pixel;radiography;radiology;relevance;screening mammography;x-ray exposure time;diagnostic procedure;registration - actclass	Peter R.

In many cath labs, RT3D-TEE is already one of the requisite tools fornimage guidance during MICS. However, the visualization of the catheter is not always satisfactory making 3D-nTEE challenging to use as the only modality for guidance. We propose a novel technique for better visualizationnof the catheter along with the cardiac anatomy using TEE alone - exploiting both beamforming and post processing methods. We extended our earlier method called Delay and Standard Deviation (DASD) beamformingnto 3D in order to enhance specular reflections. The beam-formed image was further post-processed by the Franginfilter to segment the catheter. Multi-variate visualization techniques enabled us to render both the standardntissue and the DASD beam-formed image on a clinical ultrasound scanner simultaneously. A frame rate of 15nFPS was achieved.	real-time transcription	Pawel Kozlowski;Raja Sekhar Bandaru;Jan D'hooge;Eigil Samset	2017		10.1117/12.2253835	specular reflection;visualization;ultrasonography;heart;physics	Visualization	40.87818789402256	-85.31687177674556	190376

Diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI is potentially able to measure Ti as it is sensitive to the average displacement of water molecules in tissue. However, previous work addressing this has been hampered by a lack of both sensitive data and accurate mathematical models. We address the latter problem by constructing a computational model using Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning in order to learn a mapping between features derived from DW MR signals and ground truth microstructure parameters. We test our method using simulated and in vivo human brain data. Simulation results show that our approach provides a marked improvement over the most widely used mathematical model. The trained model also predicts sensible microstructure parameters from in vivo human brain data, matching values of Ti found in the literature.	anatomical compartments;approximation;arbitrary xml rendering;axolemma;axon;biological markers;cns disorder;cell membrane permeability;computation;computational model;deep learning;diameter (qualifier value);diffusion magnetic resonance imaging;digimon world;displacement mapping;dreamwidth;estimated;gradient;gray matter;ground truth;leucaena pulverulenta;leukodystrophy;machine learning;mathematical model;mathematics;monte carlo method;multi-compartment model;myelin sheath;psychologic displacement;randomness;scanning systems;simulation;spinal cord injuries;spinal cord neoplasms;titanium;trial inclusion and exclusion criteria submission domain;undulation of the geoid;video-in video-out;white matter	Gemma L.

The main advantage of the EMTS is the fact that it is not dependent on a free line-of-sight. Unfortunately, the accuracy of the EMTS is highly affected by nearby ferromagnetic materials. The authors have explored to what extent the influence of the metallic equipment in the operating room (OR) can be compensated by collecting precise information on the nonlinear local error in the EMTS by using the OTS for setting up a calibration look-up table. After calibration of the EMTS and registration of the sensor systems in the OR the authors have found the average euclidean deviation in position readings between the DC tracker and the OTS reduced from 2.9/spl plusmn/1.0 mm to 2.1/spl plusmn/0.8 mm within a half-sphere of 530-mm radius around the magnetic field emitter. Furthermore the authors have found the calibration to be stable after re-registration of the sensors under varying conditions such as different heights of the OR table and varying positions of the OR equipment over a longer time interval. These results encourage the further development of a hybrid magnetooptical tracker for computer-aided surgery where the electromagnetic tracker acts as an auxiliary source of position information for the optical system. Strategies for enhancing the reliability of the proposed hybrid magnetooptic tracker by detecting artifacts induced by mobile ferromagnetic objects such as surgical tools are discussed.	cns disorder;calibration;emitter device component;field electron emission;height;lambert's cosine law;line-of-sight (missile);lookup table;magnetic resonance imaging;morphologic artifacts;nonlinear system;operating room;reading (activity);surgery, computer-assisted;tracking system;direct current;sensor (device)	Wolfgang Birkfellner;Franz Watzinger;Felix Wanschitz;Rolf Ewers;Helmar Bergmann	1998	IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging	10.1109/42.736028	computer vision;calibration;simulation;error detection and correction;index term;lookup table;magnetic field;tracking system;computer science;interference;tracking;quantum mechanics	Robotics	41.288907768768134	-86.52566173432359	190875

However magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images have significantly superior soft-tissue contrast for segmenting organs of interest and determining the target volume for treatment. This paper describes work on the development of an alternative treatment workflow enabling both organ delineation and dose planning to be performed using MRI alone. This is achieved by atlas based segmentation and the generation of pseudo-CT scans from MRI. Planning and dosimetry results for three prostate cancer patients from Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital (Australia) are presented supporting the feasibility of this workflow. Good DSC scores were found for the atlas based segmentation of the prostate (mean 0.84) and bones (mean 0.89). The agreement between MRI/pseudo-CT and CT planning was quantified by dose differences and distance to agreement in corresponding voxels. Dose differences were found to be less than 2%.

Prior to calibration, a position sensor is attached to the probe for tagging each image/volume with its position and orientation in space. The localization process of the acquired image/volume in 3D space critically requires a calibration procedure that determines its accuracy. The calibration procedure is performed to determine the transformation (translations, rotations, scaling) of the scan plan with respect to the position sensor. In the literature, there are many solutions to the US calibration, but no approach has been published so far that brings a closed form solution for this problem. The proposed methodology will provide a closed form solution from two motions of the US probe. Also, we are presenting the calibration setup along with the experiments that have been conducted with synthetic and real sequences. This calibration method is shown to be easy and fast to perform.	experiment;image scaling;synthetic intelligence	Emad Boctor;Anand Viswanathan;Michael A. Choti;Russell H.

As a common practice, all existing IECG problems are solved on anatomically-detailed heart and torso models derived from tomographic images of individual subjects. This practice constitutes a major obstacle to clinical translation of IECG methods, imposing high demands on the quality and processing of medical images. Because anatomical modeling is always associated with variations due to different factors such as image quality and segmentation methods, we design a novel and systematic approach to statistically quantify the impact of ventricular shape variations on the diagnostic accuracy of IECG methods. We propose a novel use of statistical shape modeling to account for the variations in subject-specific anatomical modeling, and from it to generate ventricular models with controlled variations, whose relation to the variations of IECG outputs are then statistically assessed. In this study, we test the feasibility of the proposed approach considering two existing IECG methods for epicardial potential reconstruction and transmural action potential imaging. Both phantom and real-data experiments report statistical equivalency of IECG diagnostic accuracy on ventricular models with local variations. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach to be generalized to establish the proper level of anatomical details needed in ventricular modeling, which has the potential to change the common practice and facilitate the clinical translation of IECG research.	action potential;experiment;image quality;phantom reference;statistical model;tomography	Azar Rahimi;Linwei Wang	2013	2013 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging	10.1109/ISBI.2013.6556537	computer vision;pathology;computer science;mathematics;image segmentation;statistics	Vision	43.09466304306572	-80.25617066813793	191488

Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is an advanced therapeutic endoscopy technique with superior clinical outcome due to the minimally invasive and en bloc removal of tumours. In the western world, ESD is seldom carried out, due to its complex and challenging nature. Various surgical systems are being developed to make this therapy accessible, however, these solutions have shown limited operational workspace, dexterity, or low force exertion capabilities. The current paper shows the ESD CYCLOPS system, a bimanual surgical robotic attachment that can be mounted at the end of any flexible endoscope. The system is able to achieve forces of up to 46N, and showed a mean error of 0.217mm during an elliptical tracing task. The workspace and instrument dexterity is shown by pre-clinical ex vivo trials, in which ESD is succesfully performed by a GI surgeon. The system is currently undergoing pre-clinical in vivo validation.		Timo J. C. Oude Vrielink;Ming Zhao;Ara Darzi;George P.

This submission details a contact-modelling pipeline suitable for implementation in explicit matrix-free FEM solvers. While these FEM algorithms have been shown to be very suitable for simulation of soft tissue biomechanics and successfully used in a number of image-guidance systems, contact modelling specifically for these solvers is rarely addressed, partly because the typically large number of time steps required with this class of FEM solvers has led to a perception of them being a poor choice for simulations requiring complex contact modelling. The presented algorithm is capable of handling most scenarios typically encountered in image-guidance. The contact forces are computed with an evolution of the Lagrange-multiplier method first used by Taylor and Flanagan in PRONTO 3D extended with spatio-temporal smoothing heuristics for improved stability and edge–edge collision handling, and a new friction model. For contact search, a bounding-volume hierarchy (BVH) is employed, which is capable of identifying self-collisions by means of the surface-normal bounding cone of Volino and Magnenat-Thalmann, in turn computed with a novel formula. The BVH is further optimised for the small time steps by reducing the number of bounding-volume refittings between iterations through identification of regions with mostly rigid motion and negligible deformation. Further optimisation is achieved by integrating the self-collision criterion in the BVH creation and updating algorithms. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on a number of artificial test cases and meshes derived from medical image data. It is shown that the proposed algorithm reduces the cost of BVH refitting to the point where it becomes a negligible part of the overall computation time of the simulation. It is also shown that the proposed surface-normal cone computation formula leads to about 40 % fewer BVH subtrees that must be checked for self-collisions compared with the widely used method of Provot. The proposed contact-force formulation and friction model are evaluated on artificial test cases that allow for a comparison with a ground truth. The quality of the proposed contact forces is assessed in terms of trajectories and energy conservation; a $$<$$ < 0.4 % drop off in total energy and highly plausible trajectories are found in the experiments. The friction model is evaluated through a benchmark problem with an analytical solution and a maximum displacement error of 8.2 %, and excellent agreement in terms of the stick/slip boundary is found. Finally, we show with realistic image-guidance examples that the entire contact-modelling pipeline can be executed within a timeframe that is of the same order of magnitude as that required for standard FEM computations.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);body dysmorphic disorders;body tissue;bounding volume hierarchy;checking (action);collision detection;computation (action);displacement mapping;exclusion;execution;experiment;finite element method;friction;general-purpose modeling;ground truth;guidance system;handling (psychology);heuristics;interaction;iteration;lagrange multiplier;linear interpolation;mathematical optimization;muscle rigidity;normal (geometry);numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;psychologic displacement;recursion (computer science);regulatory submission;retinal cone;sensor;simulation;smoothing (statistical technique);test case;time complexity;tissue membrane;tree (data structure);world file;soft tissue	Stian Flage Johnsen;Zeike A.

Label propagation (LP) from manually segmented atlases onto newly acquired images is a particularly promising approach. Methods: We investigated LP on a set of 6 three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance data sets of the brains of normal individuals. For each image, a manually prepared segmentation of 67 structures was available. Each subject image was used in turn as an atlas and registered non-rigidly to each other subject's image. The resulting transformations were applied to the label sets, yielding five different generated segmentations for each subject, which we compared with the native manual segmentations using an overlap measure (similarity index, SI). We then reviewed the LP results for five structures with varied anatomical and label characteristics visually to determine how the registration procedure had affected the delineation of their boundaries. Results: The majority of structures propagated well as measured by SI (SI > 70 in 80% of measurements). Boundaries that were marked in the atlas image by definite intensity differences were congruent, with good agreement between the manual and the generated segmentations. Some boundaries in the manual segmentation were defined as planes marked by landmarks; such boundaries showed greater mismatch. In some cases, the proximity of structures with similar intensity distorted the LP results: e.g., parts of the parahippocampal gyrus were labeled as hippocampus in two cases. Conclusion: The size and shape of anatomical structures can be determined reliably using label propagation, especially where boundaries are defined by distinct differences in grey scale image intensity. These results will inform further work to evaluate potential clinical uses of information extracted from images in this way.© (2005) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Based on interesting observations and efficient geometric techniques, we present in this paper new algorithmic solutions for this problem. Comparing with existing optimization-based approaches, our techniques yield better accuracy, have bounded execution time, and thus are more suitable for on-line applications.

Firstly, a simple and accurate 6DOF reposition planning method of the two fragments using “volume registration” of preoperative CT data is proposed by assuming that the left and right femurs of normal patients are mirror-symmetric. Secondly, a method for floroscopic tracking of the proximal fragment without attaching the reference markers is proposed. The method effectively combines 2D/3D registration from a single-view fluoroscopic image with the constraint of “hip joint rotation center” obtained by pelvis tracking. The reposition planning and fluoroscopic tracking methods were validated by simulation experiments using CT data of healthy and fractured femurs, respectively. The total error of the whole system was also evaluated.

The gold standard method for estimating the severity of emphysema is a lung function test, such as forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1). However, several clinical studies showed that chest CT scans offer more sensitive estimates of emphysema progression. The standard CT densitometric score of emphysema is the relative area of voxels below a threshold (RA). The RA score is a global measurement and reflects the overall emphysema progression. In this work, we propose a framework for estimation of local emphysema progression from longitudinal chest CT scans. First, images are registered to a common system of coordinates and then local image dissimilarities are computed in corresponding anatomical locations. Finally, the obtained dissimilarity representation is converted into a single emphysema progression score. We applied the proposed algorithm on 27 patients with severe emphysema with CT scans acquired five time points, at baseline, after 3, after 12, after 21 and after 24 or 30 months. The results showed consistent emphysema progression with time and the overall progression score correlates significantly with the increase in RA score.		Vladlena Gorbunova;Sander S. A. M.

Freehand SPECT and freehand PET provide intra-operative functional imaging techniques that can be complemented with pre- and intra-operative MR imaging to allow for better planning, navigation and guidance. In this paper we propose a method to enable navigation based on pre- or intra-operatively acquired MR images. A fully MR compatible phantom and a dedicated MR compatible optical tracking target with MR markers is built for this study. PET/MR, SPECT/CT and freehand SPECT scans of the phantom are performed. Registration is done using point based registration of the known marker and target geometries and a ground truth is obtained from a SPECT/CT and an MR image that are directly registered. The RMS errors was 0.31mm for the ground truth and 3.29mm when using segmentation of the MR markers and their spatial relationship with the optical tracking spheres of the dedicated target. Thus, the freehand SPECT can be registered easily by this approach without the need of any additional CT scans and therefore without any additional radiation dose for the patient. This enables intra-operative fusion of the pre- or intra-operatively acquired MR data, which could provide valuable additional information for intra-operative applications such as guidance based on accurate anatomy or verifying exact tumor location in combination with detailed morphological patient data.	adobe freehand;anatomic structures;ct scan;functional imaging;ground truth;imaging techniques;imaging phantom;navigation;patients;phantoms, imaging;polyethylene terephthalate;prostatic neoplasms;scanning;sentinel lymph node biopsy;sentinel value;verification and validation;verifying specimen;lymph nodes;registration - actclass	Philipp Matthies;Asli Okur;Thomas Wendler;Nassir Navab;Michael Friebe	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610267	computer vision;radiology;computer science;image registration;image segmentation;nuclear medicine;medical physics	Visualization	40.94466127038167	-84.03350629442824	194232

To maintain good acoustic coupling between the probe and the skin, the operator applies pressure on thenskin with the probe. This pressure deforms the underlying tissues in a variable way across the excursion of the probe,nwhich, in turn, leads to inconsistencies in the volume. To address this problem, this paper proposes a method to estimatenthe deformation field sustained by each image with respect to a reference deformation free image. The method is basednon a 2D biomechanical model that takes into account the mechanical parameters of the tissues depicted in the image tonpredict a realistic deformation field. These parameters are estimated along with the deformation field such as tonmaximize the mutual information between the reference and the corrected images. The image is then corrected bynapplying the inverse deformation field. Preliminary validation was conducted with synthetic US images generated usingna 3D biomechanical model. Results show that the proposed method improves image correction compared to a purelynimage-based method.

These methods allow the surgeon to optimally plan fiducial marker locations on routine diagnostic images before preoperative imaging and to intraoperatively select the set of fiducial markers and anatomical landmarks that minimize the expected target registration error (TRE). The optimization relies on a novel empirical simulation-based TRE estimation method built on actual fiducial localization error (FLE) data. Our methods take the guesswork out of the registration process and can reduce localization error without additional imaging and hardware. Our clinical experiments on five patients who underwent brain surgery with a navigation system show that optimizing one marker location and the anatomical landmarks configuration reduced the TRE. The average TRE values using the usual fiducials setup and using the suggested method were 4.7 mm and 3.2 mm, respectively. We observed a maximum improvement of 4 mm. Reducing the target registration error has the potential to support safer and more accurate minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures.	computation;experiment;fiducial markers;fiducial marker;flip-flop (electronics);mandibular right second molar tooth;mathematical optimization;minimally invasive surgical procedures;muscle rigidity;patients;preparation;science of neurosurgery;simulation;tre;cellular targeting;registration - actclass	Reuben R.

It has the potential to distinguish between ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke with a portable and inexpensive device. The image reconstruction relies on an accurate forward model of the experimental setup. Because of the relatively small signal in stroke EIT, the finite-element modeling requires meshes of more than 10 million elements. To study the requirements in the forward modeling in EIT and also to reduce the time for experimental image acquisition, it is necessary to reduce the run time of the forward computation. We show the implementation of a parallel forward solver for EIT using the Dune-Fem C++ library and demonstrate its performance on many CPU's of a computer cluster. For a typical EIT application a direct solver was significantly slower and not an alternative to iterative solvers with multigrid preconditioning. With this new solver, we can compute the forward solutions and the Jacobian matrix of a typical EIT application with 30 electrodes on a 15-million element mesh in less than 15 min. This makes it a valuable tool for simulation studies and EIT applications with high precision requirements.

In this study, the accuracy and feasibility of this curved-bladed Tuke Saw in spherical osteotomy were examined in comparison with the conventional curved chisel. Hemispherical osteotomy on rectangular parallelepiped blocks of Sawbones and rotational acetabular osteotomy on cadaveric pelves were performed with these surgical tools. With both the tools, the distance error of the actual osteotomy surface from the sphere of the plan got larger when the position got deeper, however, the extent was smaller with the curved-bladed Tuke Saw. The procedure time with the curved-bladed Tuke Saw was about half of that with the curved chisel. Therefore, it can be said that the curved-bladed Tuke Saw is more accurate and feasible than the conventional curved chisel.

In this study, methods for estimating diffusion spectrum measures (the zero-displacement probability, the mean-squared displacement, and the orientation distribution function) directly from the q-space signals are described. These methods were evaluated using both computer simulations and hybrid diffusion imaging (HYDI) measurements on a human brain. The HYDI method obtains diffusion-weighted measurements on concentric spheres in q-space. Monte Carlo computer simulations were performed to investigate effects of noise, q-space truncation, and sampling interval on the measures. This new direct computation approach reduces HYDI data processing time and image artifacts arising from 3-D FT and regridding interpolation. In addition, it is less sensitive to the noise and q-space truncation effects than conventional approach. Although this study focused on data using the HYDI scheme, this computation approach may be applied to other diffusion sampling schemes including Cartesian diffusion spectrum imaging.	arabic numeral 0;cartesian closed category;computation (action);computer simulation;diffusion anisotropy;diffusion magnetic resonance imaging;diffusion spectrum imaging;displacement mapping;estimated;experiment;imaging, three-dimensional;interpolation imputation technique;marginal model;monte carlo method;morphologic artifacts;portable document format;protein truncation abnormality;psychologic displacement;sampling (signal processing);spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared;visual artifact;whittaker–shannon interpolation formula	Yu-Chien Wu;Aaron S.

The authors present a novel interpolation method whereby the collected frames are decomposed into a multiresolution hierarchy and a pixel-recursive algorithm is employed from the lowest to highest resolution in the hierarchy to obtain estimates of the pixel displacements. The intensity changes between corresponding pixels are then interpolated to fill in the missing frames. The authors show a computer simulation of the method, where only 11 of the original 29 frames produce a natural, nearly artifact-free rendition of the sequence. >	interpolation;motion estimation;pixel;recursion	William A.

The objectives of these studies require accurate spatio-temporal estimation of the underlying neural generators, a challenging task due to the relatively low signal strength and high correlation between bilateral auditory cortical sources. This paper evaluates the performance of two beamforming schemes that can potentially overcome such difficulties: 1) the linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer with partial sensor coverage (LCMV-PSC), and 2) the multiple constrained minimum-variance beamformer with coherent source region suppression (MCMV-CSRS). Simulation experiments are conducted to assess the impact of source parameters on the reconstruction accuracy. The results indicate that the LCMV-PSC method is prone to localization errors that essentially occur along medio-lateral directions, increase with source depth, and are associated to amplitude and phase distortions of the estimated time courses of activity. Comparatively, the MCMV-CSRS method exhibits precise localization and minimal amplitude and phase distortion for a broad range of relative interferer's positions within the suppression region. The results from the numerical experiments are validated on real magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data collected from a 40-Hz ASSR paradigm.	beamforming;bilateral filter;coherence (physics);exhibits as topic;experiment;hearing problem;lateral thinking;lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus;magnetoencephalography;multi-function printer;numerical analysis;phase distortion;programming paradigm;psychopathology;sample variance;simulation;steady state;zero suppression	Mihai Popescu;Elena-Anda Popescu;Tszping Chan;Shannon D.

37947d49122531454209fe37a4850b3d6454bf98	a totally deflated lung's ct image construction by means of extrapolated deformable registration	lung cancer;deformable registration;ct;deflation;ultrasound;extrapolation;lung;non rigid registration;brachytherapy;tumor targeting;imaging;b spline;ultrasonography;multi resolution;construction;demons	A novel technique is proposed to construct CT image of a totally deflated lung using breath-hold lung's preoperative CT images acquired during respiration. Such a constructed CT image is very useful in tumor targeting during tumor ablative procedures such as lung brachytherapy used for lung cancer treatment. To minimize motion within the target lung, tumor ablative procedures are frequently performed while the lung is totally deflated. Deflating the lung during such procedures renders pre-operative images ineffective for tumor targeting, because those images correspond to the lung while it is partially inflated. Furthermore, the problem cannot be solved using intra-operative Ultrasound (US) images. This is because the quality of lung US images degrades substantially as a result of the residual air inside the deflated lung, thus it is not an effective intra-operative imaging modality by itself. One possible approach for image-guided lung brachytherapy is to register high quality preoperative CT images of the deflated lung with their corresponding low quality intra-operative US images. To obtain the CT images of deflated lung, a novel image construction technique is presented. The proposed technique was implemented using two deformable registration methods: multi-resolution B-spline and multi-resolution demons. The technique was applied to ex vivo porcine lungs where results obtained were found to be very encouraging.© (2011) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

908f29e1abac026d0416a79cb3403ed7f026283e	better feature matching for placental panorama construction		Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is a potentially fatal placental vascular disease of twin pregnancies. The only definitive treatment is surgical cauterization of problematic vascular formations with a fetal endoscope. This surgery is made difficult by the poor visibility conditions of the intrauterine environment and the limited field of view of the endoscope. There have been efforts to address the limited field of view of fetal endoscopes with algorithms that use visual correspondences between successive fetoscopic video frames to stitch those frames together into a composite map of the placental surface. The existing work, however, has been evaluated primarily on ex vivo images of placentas, which tend to have more visual features and fewer visual distractors than the in vivo images that would be encountered in actual surgical procedures. This work shows that guiding feature matching with deep learned segmentations of placental vessels and grid-based motion statistics can make feature-based registration tractable even in in vivo images that have few distinctive visual features.	algorithm;cobham's thesis;image stitching;locality of reference;map;nearest neighbor search;scale-invariant feature transform;speeded up robust features;video-in video-out	Praneeth Sadda;John A.

It allows recording an image consisting of N(2) pixels using much fewer than N(2) measurements if it can be transformed to a basis where most pixels take on negligibly small values. Standard compressive sensing techniques suffer from the computational overhead needed to reconstruct an image with typical computation times between hours and days and are thus not optimal for applications in physics and spectroscopy. We demonstrate an adaptive compressive sampling technique that performs measurements directly in a sparse basis. It needs much fewer than N(2) measurements without any computational overhead, so the result is available instantly.	compressed sensing;computation (action);ghost imaging;overhead (computing);pixel;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;sparse matrix	Marc Aßmann;Manfred Bayer	2013		10.1038/srep01545	computer vision;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science	Graphics	49.270974465597945	-81.95032929004655	196806

In a study using 5 fresh cadavers, the average registration error for selected points near the surface of the femoral cavity was 0.59 mm; this is comparable to the errors reported for the geometry -based registration methods.	fiducial marker;noise shaping;robot	Yong-San Yoon;Jung-Ju Lee;Dong-Soo Kwon;Jun Hui Won;Antony J.

For the synchronization, we present a real-time registration system between the two images of the liver without any help of sensors. In this system, we first generate a 4D preoperative image, which is composed of multiple 3D images along the respiration, by considering their local deformation. In the intraoperative stage, we achieve the pose information of a pose-fixed 3D US transducer by using several 3D US images. We then acquire 2D US images and find their corresponding images in real-time from the 4D preoperative image. The related registration is done by comparing a gradient-based similarity measure between a 2D US image and generated 2D preoperative image candidates. By the visual assessment of registration results, we confirm the feasibility of the proposed system for image-guidance.	ct scan;data acquisition;gradient;modality (human–computer interaction);prospective search;radiology;real-time clock;sensor;similarity measure;transducer;video game graphics	Duhgoon Lee;Woo Hyun Nam;Donggyu Hyun;Jae Young Lee;Jong Beom Ra	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro	10.1109/ISBI.2010.5490329	synchronization;computer vision;radiology;medicine;computer science;computed tomography;medical physics	Robotics	41.415385966683836	-85.17544655842954	197884

High resolution mammograms usually lead to more accurate diagnoses; however, they require large doses of radiation, which may have harmful effects. In this paper, we present a method to synthesize high-resolution mammograms from low-resolution inputs, which offers the potential of allowing accurate diagnoses while minimizing risks to patients. Our algorithm combines statistical machine learning methods and stochastic search to learn the mapping from low-resolution to high-resolution mammograms using a large dataset of training image pairs. Experimental results show that the super-resolution algorithm can generate high-quality, high-resolution breast mammograms from low-resolution input with no human intervention.	algorithm;central processing unit;data compression;digital imaging;graphics processing unit;image resolution;lr parser;machine learning;medical imaging;radiography;stochastic optimization;stream processing;super-resolution imaging;x-ray (amazon kindle)	Jun Zheng;Olac Fuentes;Ming-Ying Leung	2010	2010 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology	10.1109/CIBCB.2010.5510384	stochastic process;computer vision;image resolution;computer science;machine learning;multimedia	Comp.	46.05265584330861	-83.48139265506241	198139

Modified deterministic annealing algorithm is a very efficient segmentation algorithm for isolating MS lesions in the MR images when utilizing all the information contained in all modalities. To fully utilize the information contained in all the modalities, vector segmentation is carried out instead of unimodal segmentation. The vectors to be clustered are formed by multi-modal MR brain data. Through some arithmetic manipulations synthesized image data can be obtained which greatly alleviate the effect of noise and intensity inhomogeneity. Isolated multiple sclerosis lesions are outliers to the brain tissues. Even with noise level up to 7% the MS MR brain data can still be satisfactorily segmented. This method does not need a prior model, and is conceptually very simple. It delineates not only large lesions but small ones as well. The whole process is completely automated without any intervention by an operator, which can be a very promising tool for MS follow-up studies. Comparison between the segmentation results from the simulated MS brain data and from the clinical MS brain data shows that with the current high quality MRI facilities, images with noise above 3% and intensity inhomogeneity above 20% will usually not be produced. Segmentation results for the clinical data are much better and easier to obtain than the simulated noisy data. To get even better results for the MS lesions, inverse problem techniques have to be applied. Noise model and intensity inhomogeneity model have to be established and improved using the given MRI data during iteration.© (2002) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

It is essential to obtain a 3D visualization of the implanted seeds and their relative position to the prostate. For this, a robust and precise segmentation of the seeds in 2D X-ray is required. First, implanted seeds are segmented using a region-based implicit active contour approach. Then, n-seed clusters are resolved using an efficient template based approach. A collection of 55 C-arm images from 10 patients are used to validate the proposed algorithm. Compared to manual ground-truth segmentation of 6002 seeds, 98.7% of seeds were automatically detected and declustered showing a false-positive rate of only 1.7%. Results indicate the proposed method is able to perform the identification and annotation processes of seeds on par with a human expert, constituting a viable alternative to the traditional manual segmentation approach.	active contour model;algorithm;connected component (graph theory);ground truth;visualization (graphics);x-ray (amazon kindle)	Chiara Amat di San Filippo;Gabor Fichtinger;William J.

The proposed system is being designed around a standard slit-lamp biomicroscope. The microscope will be interfaced to a CCD camera, and the image sent to a video capture board. A single computer workstation will coordinate image capture , registration, and display. The captured image is registered with previously stored, montaged photographic and angiographic data, with superposition facilitated by fundus-landmark-based fast registration algorithms. The computer then drives a high intensity, VGA resolution video display with adjustable brightness and contrast attached to one of the oculars of the slitlamp biomicroscope. Preliminary studies with a modiied binocular operating microscope interfaced to a Sun Ultra1 Workstation and an IBM-compatible PC demonstrates proof-of-principle. Robust, accurate fundus image montaging is accomplished with Hausdorr-distance-based methods. For photographic and angiographic data where the vessel gray levels vary from light to dark, and intensity-based correlation methods fail, image-preprocessing with smoothing, edge-detection, and thresholding facilitates registration. Non-real-time registration (0:4 ? 4:0 CPU seconds) is achieved by non-optimized simple template matching (translation only, Matrox Inspector) or Hausdorr-distance-based (translation and scaling) algorithms performed on edge-detected fundus photographic and angiographic images, and on images of a model eye. Successful registration and image overlay of color, monochromatic, and angiographic images is demonstrated. To our knowledge , these studies represent the rst investigation towards design and implementation of an ophthalmic augmented reality environment. Summary Page a. What is the original contribution of this work? To our knowledge, our investigations represent the rst investigations towards the design and construction of an ophthalmic augmented reality environment b. Why should this contribution be considered important? Our application should allow for more eecacious treatment and evaluation of potentially blinding diseases. c. What is the most closely related work by others and how does this work diier? Similar investigations of image overlay/augmented reality in other surgical disciplines have be explored, but these technologies and methods have not been applied to diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases. d. How can other researchers make use of the results of this work? Our results demonstrate new methods for fast, two dimensional image registration, and we present a novel design for an image overlay applications. e.
