We specificarb examine scalability and cost of video on demand systems. By examining trends in storage technologies, we note the cost advantages of using hierarchical storage that include both secondary and tertiary storage devices over purely disk based video servers. Finally, we show how using emerging storage area networks allows us to scale both the video content capacity as well as the number of video streams supported.	computer data storage;digital video;hierarchical storage management;scalability;storage area network;streaming media	Aloke Guha	1999		10.1109/MMCS.1999.779122	real-time computing;storage area network;converged storage;computer science;operating system;multimedia;information repository;computer network	HPC	-8.85434261497293	102.77419795688488	145390

Internet checksumuses1’s complementarithmetic to detect errors in the content delivered by the data-link layer. Both research and experiencehave shown that there are a wide variety of error sourceswhich can not be detectedby this lower layer. The error detectingperformanceof 1’scomplementchecksum determineshow many of theseerrors will be passedto higher layers, including the application layer. The performance analysiswill also influenceprotocol designand improvement, for example,header compression. Unfortunately, previous work on this topic only determined the number of error passingpatterns and the probability for and bit errors, and the method usedfor determining the probability is hard to extendto more bit errors. In this paper, we presenta method to generatethe formula of error passingprobability. When too much calculation is neededto compute an exact result, we achieve a better estimation of the probability, which is around percent of the upper bound achievable with previous techniques when1’scomplementchecksumis usedin TCP/UDP.	bit error rate;checksum;internet protocol suite;network packet;ones' complement;viewtiful joe	Changli Jiao;Loren Schwiebert	2001		10.1109/ICCCN.2001.956312	checksum;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer security;transport layer;computer network	Metrics	-5.8486049045293536	103.64668695439586	150564

First, an overview of dead reckoning techniques used in distributed virtual environments is provided. The benefits and drawbacks of implementing dead reckoning within specific types of distributed virtual environments are discussed. An alternative to traditional dead reckoning techniques used in DIS-compliant distributed virtual environments is proposed. The alternative, referred to as """"pre-reckoning,"""" seeks to significantly reduce prediction error with a minimal increase in the number of entity state update packets issued. The performance of the pre-reckoning algorithm is compared to one of the DIS standard algorithms for location prediction. The test cases are based upon a game-based environment where the movements of participants are influenced by physical boundaries."""	algorithm;dead reckoning;test case;virtual reality	Thomas P.

However, DCS-cast's efficiency is not actually high due to its ignorance of the temporal correlation in each packet at the encoder. This paper proposes an improved scheme named DCT-DCS-cast that removes such temporal correlation through a one-dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (1D-DCT) based on the observation that there exists strong temporal redundancies in each packet of measurements. The power allocation is proposed to minimize the reconstruction errors in each packet. When compared to the benchmark DCS-cast scheme and SoftCast, our DCT-DCS-cast scheme is able to provide better performance when some packets are lost during the transmission in both cases of unicast and multicast.	benchmark (computing);cliff effect;compressed sensing;decorrelation;discrete cosine transform;distortion;encoder;mathematical optimization;multicast;network packet;r-cast;signal-to-noise ratio;unicast	Kai Zhang;Anhong Wang;Haidong Wang	2016	2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)	10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820733	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	-6.397973959469316	103.05681387934796	172111

The problem is exacerbated due to the limited network bandwidth and error-prone transmission. Using the metric of time-space inconsistency (TSI), we analytically derive the impact of message loss on TSI when using a dead reckoning (DR)-based update mechanism. To improve consistency, a naive algorithm and a compensation algorithm for update scheduling are proposed, in which expected spatial difference and expected TSI are, respectively, calculated by taking message loss into account. Using these algorithms, a budget-based mechanism is developed to meet the network bandwidth constraint. We show through experiments using a racing car game that the budget-based mechanism using the compensation algorithm makes the best use of available network bandwidth to reduce the inconsistency and its impact on the participants, and ensures fairness among participants in spite of widely varying message loss rates.	digital video effect;scheduling (computing)	Zhengzhou Li;Wentong Cai;X.

Battery lifetime significantly improves by shutting down transceiver and giving idle time to battery, at the cost of image quality degradation. Measurement shows effective battery lifetime increases to 2~3 times at the PSNR degradation of 0.25 dB.	channel (communications);data compression;elegant degradation;image quality;peak signal-to-noise ratio;recovery effect;transceiver	Yong-Ju Jang;Hyeon-Cheol Yang;Seongsoo Lee	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)	10.1109/ICCE.2012.6161954	image quality;electronic engineering;uncompressed video;telecommunications;computer science;constant bitrate;computer network	Robotics	-6.46270722931589	102.92031768567163	178449

One key task at the encoder is to adapt its compression on the fly based on time-varying network bandwidth and video characteristics - while attaining low delay and high classification accuracy. In this paper, we formalize the decision at the encoder side as an infinite horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP). We employ low-complexity, model-free reinforcement learning schemes to solve this problem efficiently under dynamic and unknown environment. Our proposed scheme adopts the technique of virtual experience (VE) update to drastically speed up convergence over conventional Q-learning, allowing the encoder to react to abrupt network changes on the order of minutes, instead of hours. In comparison to myopic optimization, it consistently achieves higher overall reward and lower sending delay under various network conditions.	encoder;markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;on the fly;q-learning;real-time locating system;reinforcement learning;streaming media;time-varying network	Xiaoqing Zhu;Cuiling Lan;Mihaela van der Schaar	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)	10.1109/ICME.2013.6607600	data compression;computer vision;contextual image classification;simulation;decision theory;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;accuracy and precision;multimedia;markov process;bandwidth;encoding;statistics	Robotics	-6.9912723154449115	104.45950932689149	185295

Clearly, the sensors cannot use arbitrary rates in a shared network, and a standard network rate control algorithm may not provide rates amenable to effective target tracking. For Kalman filter-based multi-sensor target tracking, we derive a utility function that captures the tracking quality of service as a function of bit-rate. We incorporate this utility function into a network rate resource allocation framework, deriving a distributed rate control algorithm for a shared network that does not require network re-design. In simulation studies, the new rate-control algorithm engenders much better tracking performance than a standard rate-control method.	algorithm;kalman filter;quality of service;sensor;simulation;utility	M.
