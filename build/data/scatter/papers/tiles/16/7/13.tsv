Research has shown that real-time, per-appliance electricity usage feedback can induce behavior changes that lead to 10% to 20% reduction in usage [2].  We present ACME: an IP-based wireless device that provides real time energy usage measurement and control for AC devices. This device fills the gap between inexpensive watt-meters and expensive networked enterprise energy monitors. We show that ACME provides accurate measurement of active, reactive, and apparent energy from milli-amps to tens of amps. We also demonstrate its ability to remotely switch the connected appliance.  In this demo, we will present a complete home monitoring system that integrates a set of ACMEs with an 802.15.4-to-802.11 router and a web server. Energy measurements will be pushed directly into a database by the ACMEs via UDP and retrieved by the web server continuously or on-demand to generate real-time graphs.	performance per watt;real-time computing;real-time transcription;real-time web;router (computing);server (computing);web server	Xiaofan Jiang;Stephen Dawson-Haggerty;Jay Taneja;Prabal Dutta;David E.

This is due to the vast scope of IoT. Internet of Things refers to the worldwide network of interconnected objects, which allow people or things to be connected anytime, anyplace, with anything and anyone, using any path, any network and any service. The objects have different characteristics: mobile or static, with or without energy constraint, different computation and storage capabilities, equipped with different communication technologies and sensors, etc.	internet of things	Abderrezak Rachedi;Mubashir Husain Rehmani;Soumaya Cherkaoui;Joel Jos&#x00E9; P.

It can be classified into static or dynamic, depending on whether the connections are given in advance or randomly arrive/depart. In this paper, an analytical model is developed for dynamic traffic grooming, allowing heterogeneous data rates for sub-wavelength connections, arbitrary alternate routing in both logical and physical topologies, and arbitrary wavelength conversion. The accuracy of the model has been verified by numerical results from simulation.	numerical analysis;randomness;routing;simulation;wavelength-division multiplexing	Chunsheng Xin	2007	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1145/1295237.1295256	index term;traffic grooming;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network	Metrics	-5.393160950544387	84.25501825259927	71137

Nowadays, massive amounts of generated network and correlated (networked) data pose critical computational and storage challenges, requiring the development of radical techniques to manage, process, and analyze them more efficiently. We propose embedding such data and their correlations in hyperbolic metric spaces as one approach aspiring to radically change current practices. In this article, we explore the potential that such data embedding and the corresponding hyperbolic space based data analytics can offer to networks, their applications, and their services. We demonstrate how this approach may lead to more efficient and scalable problem solving within diverse application domains, such as network design/analysis, network resource allocation optimization, and network economics/marketing, paving the way for more diverse and effective solutions in the future.	betweenness centrality;big data;broadcast driver architecture;computation;experiment;intel high definition audio;machine learning;mathematical optimization;network planning and design;problem solving;programming paradigm;recommender system;scalability;theory	Eleni Stai;Vasileios Karyotis;Symeon Papavassiliou	2016	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2016.7389825	analytics;routing;big data;computer science;data science;resource management;data mining;network simulation;management science;data analysis;network topology;measurement;computer network	ML	-14.776225347665578	79.02719859434684	71210

MPTCP overcomes few limitations of TCP thereby offering added benefits like increased throughput and network resource utilization and resilience to possible link failures. Different data paths over the network face different end-to-end path delay. The performance of MPTCP is affected not only by the delay but also by the difference in delays experienced by various paths of the same connection. MPTCP runs on the host, and it is not aware of the underlying network topology. Hosts cannot create optimal paths to destination without assistance from a network control element. We use SDN technology to provide this assistance to MPTCP and to setup best available paths for MPTCP connections. In this paper we present the design of an SDN-based path manager for MPTCP, the implementation of an automated testbed for performance evaluation, and an in-depth analysis of different scheduling algorithms to understand how delay and delay differences between the paths affect the overall performance of MPTCP protocol.	algorithm;end-to-end principle;experiment;internet protocol suite;network congestion;network topology;performance evaluation;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);software-defined networking;test case;testbed;throughput;vii	Navin Kukreja;Guido Maier;Rodolfo Alvizu;Achille Pattavina	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC)	10.1109/ICCW.2016.7503872	communications protocol;programming;throughput;real-time computing;network switch;computer science;distributed computing;network topology;bandwidth;computer network	Mobile	-13.129701896930593	82.46851306060587	71279

Based on our experiences in building one of the largest distributed systems in the world, we illustrate how sophisticated algorithmic research has been adapted to balance the load between and within server clusters, manage the caches on servers, select paths through an overlay routing network, and elect leaders in various contexts. In each instance, we first explain the theory underlying the algorithms, then introduce practical considerations not captured by the theoretical models, and finally describe what is implemented in practice. Through these examples, we highlight the role of algorithmic research in the design of complex networked systems.

Although the current traffic is successfully supported on fixed grid networks, flexgrid technology brings features that are not offered by the fixed grid networks, such as transporting optical connections with a capacity beyond 100 Gb/s and elasticity against time-varying traffic. In light of this, a gradual fixed grid to flexgrid migration is generally accepted in order to add these useful features to the network. In this article, we study the migration process where flexgrid is deployed in the network progressively, and review the main drivers and open issues induced by its deployment.	elasticity (cloud computing);gigabyte;software deployment	Marc Ruiz;Luis Velasco;Andrew Lord;Daniel Fonseca;Michal PiÃ³ro;Roland WessÃ¤ly;Juan P.

And it provides a programmable network architecture that could facilitate network innovation rapidly. OpenFlow is a network protocol that standardizes the communications between OpenFlow controllers and OpenFlow switches. It is considered as an enabler of SDN. The flow table in OpenFlow switches plays a critical role in OpenFlow-based SDN, which stores the rules populated by the controllers for controlling and directing the packet flows in SDN. Nevertheless, they also become a new target of malicious attacks. This paper analyzes the flow table overflow attack, a type of denial of service attacks, and proposes a systematic way to mitigate the overflow in flow table.	communications protocol;control plane;cost efficiency;countermeasure (computer);denial-of-service attack;forwarding plane;network architecture;network packet;network switch;openflow;population;software-defined networking	Ying Qian;Wanqing You;Kai Qian	2016	2016 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)	10.1109/EuCNC.2016.7561033	openflow;computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Security	-15.774454785333802	82.57955677081831	71890

However, controlling distributed cache nodes to update cached contents synergistically is still challenging in designing cooperative cache systems. This paper proposes an SDN-based Cooperative Cache Network (SCCN) for ISP networks, aiming to minimize the content transmission latency while reducing the inter-ISP traffic. Based on the proposed increment recording mechanism, the SCCN Controller can timely capture the change of content popularity, and place the most popular contents on the appropriate SCCN Switches. We formulate the optimal content placement as a specific multi-commodity facility location problem and prove its NP-hardness. We propose a Relaxation Algorithm (RA) based on relaxation-rounding technique to solve the problem, which can achieve an approximation ratio of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$1/2$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""""cui-ieq1-2651901.gif""""/> </alternatives></inline-formula> in the worst case. To solve large scale problems for big data efficiently, we further design a Heuristic Algorithm (HA), which can find a near-optimal solution with three orders of magnitude speedup compared to RA. Specifically, HA can achieve a desirable tradeoff between the transmission delay and the Internet traffic. We implement a prototype based on <monospace>Open vSwitch</monospace> to demonstrate the feasibility of SCCN. Extensive trace-based simulation results show the effectiveness of SCCN under various network conditions."""	approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;big data;cache (computing);distributed cache;facility location problem;heuristic (computer science);internet;linear programming relaxation;np-hardness;network switch;prototype;relaxation (iterative method);rounding;software-defined networking;speedup;synergy;trace-based simulation;traffic collision avoidance system;xlink	Yong Cui;Jian Song;Minming Li;Qingmei Ren;Yangjun Zhang;Xuejun Cai	2018	IEEE Transactions on Big Data	10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2651901	distributed cache;latency (engineering);speedup;computer science;heuristic (computer science);approximation algorithm;cache;transmission delay;algorithm design;distributed computing	Mobile	-10.418292860015631	82.69583751080872	72129

In our model. terminals transmit information in bursts consisting of many packets and compete for the right to transmit bursts. In the simplest case, the channel allows only one terminal to transmit at a time; this can be extended to k concurrentâ transmitters. The problem resembles contention resolution in local area networks. It is distinguished by the topology of the channel, the magnitude of the delays involved and the potential for multiple transmitters. In this paper we identify two general approaches and several specific access arbitration algorithms and make a preliminary assessment of their promise.	algorithm;channel (communications);multipoint ground;transmitter	Riccardo Melen;Jonathan S.

Numerous studies based on complex measurement platforms have been carried out for over ten years now in order to discover the Internet topology on domain level. The routing realized by Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is strongly influenced by commercial relationships which exist between domains, because domain operators do not want to make public the routes they know, as announcing certain routes would deprive them of a possible financial benefit. Consequently, routes available in BGP tables are valley-free and they are âspannedâ on the inter-domain hierarchy. This property of BGP routes has an impact on the performance of protocols which are proposed to assure the QoS. We examined the existing Internet topologies gathered on the domain level over the six year period in the context of their hierarchy. We used aSHIIP, our random hierarchical topology generator, to induct the hierarchy into the collected topologies. We proposed new methods for detecting the core of a network. Thanks to this analysis we have been able to put forward solid inter-domain hierarchy induction methods which are implemented in our publicly available tool.	autonomous system (internet);border gateway protocol;independent set (graph theory);inter-domain;internet topology;network topology;procedural generation;routing;sensor;tree network	Joanna Tomasik;Marc-Antoine Weisser	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6363705	routing table;the internet;internet topology;hierarchical routing;quality of service;convergence;topology table;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;default-free zone;computer security;network topology;computer network;logical topology;network mapping	Metrics	-11.930901464374113	78.72873406503528	72278

The currently used methods for such analysis are either costly - such as in drive tests, partly unreliable - such as in network simulation approaches, or are not precise enough - such as in base station key performance indicators (KPI) based approaches. In this paper, towards addressing these inadequacies, we propose a 3G coverage analysis method that makes use of âbig dataâ processing schemes and the vast amounts of network data logged in mobile operators. In the proposed scheme, the BSSAP mobility and radio resource management messages between the BSS and MSC nodes of the operator network are processed to identify inter-technology handovers from 3G (WCDMA) access to 2G (EDGE, GPRS, GSM). Demonstrative examples show that the proposed mechanism produces accurate and precise results, outperforming the base station KPI-based approach.	apache hadoop;big data;cost efficiency;locality of reference;login;radio resource management;reflections of signals on conducting lines;scalability;simulation	Ãmer Faruk Ãelebi;Engin Zeydan;Omer Faruk Kurt;Omer Dedeoglu;Ãmer Ileri;Burak AykutSungur;Ahmet Akan;Salih ErgÃ¼t	2013	ICT 2013	10.1109/ICTEL.2013.6632155	radio access network;cellular network;gprs core network;mobile telephony;public land mobile network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;base station;handover;operating system;group method of data handling;information management;mobile station;computer security;computer network	Security	-13.651691795983485	88.12658526192251	72337

Middleboxes complicate the management, the deployment, and the operations of the entire network. Moreover, they induce network performance issues and scalability limitations by requiring huge amounts of traffic to be, often sub-optimally redirected, and sometimes redundantly processed. Recent trends of server virtualization and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) exacerbate these scalability and performance issues. In this paper, we present EnforSDN - a new management approach that exploits SDN principles to decouple the policy resolution layer from the policy enforcement layer in network service appliances. Our approach improves the enforcement management, network utilization and communication latency, without compromising the policy and the functionality of the network. Using emulated SDN-based data center environment, we demonstrate higher throughput and lower latency achieved with EnforSDN, as compared to a baseline SDN network. In addition, we show that EnforSDN reduces the overall network appliances load, as well as the forwarding tables size.	baseline (configuration management);data center;emulator;firewall (computing);load balancing (computing);middlebox;network function virtualization;network performance;prototype;scalability;single-instance storage;software deployment;software-defined networking;solution architecture;throughput;vii;virtual private server	Yaniv Ben-Itzhak;Katherine Barabash;Rami Cohen;Anna Levin;Eran Raichstein	2015	2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)	10.1109/INM.2015.7140279	routing;throughput;network traffic control;intelligent computer network;network architecture;network management station;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;network management application;computer security;network topology;computer network	Networks	-14.884382175630458	82.35741859692217	72828

Most of them adopt a two-step approach. The first step assigns optimal locations to monitors, whereas the second step selects a minimal set of paths to be monitored. However, such an approach does not consider the trade-off between the optimization objectives of each step, and hence may lead to sub-optimal usage of network resources and biased measurements. In this paper, we propose to evaluate and reduce this trade-off. Toward this end, we come up with two ILP formulations for a novel monitoring cost model that apply for both passive and active monitoring. The aim is to jointly minimize the monitor location cost and the anomaly detection cost, thereby obtaining a monitoring solution that minimizes the total monitoring cost. Simulation results illustrate the interplay between the optimization objectives and evaluate the quality of the obtained monitoring solution.	anomaly detection;mathematical optimization	Emna Salhi;Samer Lahoud;Bernard Cousin	2010		10.1109/LCN.2010.5735702	delta modulation;anomaly detection;real-time computing;cost-effectiveness analysis;integer programming;computer science;linear programming;data mining;network performance;computational model;network topology;measurement	ML	-10.223476488569547	81.5695580507264	73013

Traffic Engineering support in MPLS networks allows operators to carry traffic with strict QoS requirements by means of advanced network capabilities, such as resource reservation, fault-tolerance and optimization of transmission resources. To deliver a reliable service, MPLS exploits a set of procedures that protect the traffic flows carried on different paths. Therefore, Label Switching Routers have to support mechanisms for fault detection, notification and recovery, whereas MPLS has to enable the configuration of different recovery techniques. In this paper, we present the design and the development of some software modules for the simulation of different MPLS-based recovery strategies in the discrete event simulator NS2. Moreover, the paper discusses some simulation results that show a performance comparison between path protection and path restoration strategies in a simulation scenario matching the Geant network.	circuit restoration;fault detection and isolation;fault tolerance;flow;immune tolerance;matching;mathematical optimization;multiprotocol label switching;noonan syndrome 2;numerous;path protection;quality of service;requirement;simulation;simulators;notification	Davide Adami;Christian Callegari;Daniele Ceccarelli;Stefano Giordano;Michele Pagano	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.425	multiprotocol label switching;fault tolerance;real-time computing;quality of service;computer science;resource;computer security;fault detection and isolation;computer network	Metrics	-9.10316208209394	84.22692605297391	73032

In shared experiment networks, control over resources is often limited and QoS guarantees might not be available. When the network conditions vary during a series of experiment unwanted artifacts can be introduced in the experimental results, reducing the reliability of the experiments. We propose a novel, systematic, methodology where network conditions are monitored during the experiments and information about the network is collected. This information, known as metadata, is analyzed statistically to identify periods during the experiments when the network conditions have been similar. Data points collected during these periods are valid for comparison. Our hypothesis is that this methodology can make experiments more reliable. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of our method, deployed in the FEDERICA and PlanetLab networks.	artifact (error);data point;experiment;planetlab;quality of service	Pehr SÃ¶derman;Markus Hidell;Peter SjÃ¶din	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-28534-9_15	telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;data mining;database;cluster analysis;metadata;world wide web;communications system;measurement	ML	-9.38549029962346	74.83977490273053	73102

They consider the special case of a linear net topology with n nodes. Their goal is to minimize the overall latency of accessing the target web server subject to the network resources and tra c pattern. They show how this problem can be solved in O(nm) time. In this short note, we observe that one of the underlying cost functions in this problem carries a Monge structure. By exploiting this structure and by applying some well-known results from the literature, we get a faster algorithm with time complexity O(nm). c Â© 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

e1951e342ea4ab4b112ef147d9d7059ae64429a5	an end-to-end network slicing framework for 5g wireless communication systems		Wireless industry nowadays is facing two major challenges: 1) how to support the vertical industry applications so that to expand the wireless industry market and 2) how to further enhance device capability and user experience. In this paper, we propose a technology framework to address these challenges. The proposed technology framework is based on end-to-end vertical and horizontal slicing, where vertical slicing enables vertical industry and services and horizontal slicing improves system capacity and user experience. The technology development on vertical slicing has already started in late 4G and early 5G and is mostly focused on slicing the core network. We envision this trend to continue with the development of vertical slicing in the radio access network and the air interface. Moving beyond vertical slicing, we propose to horizontally slice the computation and communication resources to form virtual computation platforms for solving the network capacity scaling problem and enhancing device capability and user experience. In this paper, we explain the concept of vertical and horizontal slicing and illustrate the slicing techniques in the air interface, the radio access network, the core network and the computation platform. This paper aims to initiate the discussion on the long-range technology roadmap and spur development on the solutions for E2E network slicing in 5G and beyond.	apevia;channel capacity;computation;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;mobile device;radio access network;scalability;user experience;vertical bar;vertical blanking interval;vertical market software	Qian Li;Geng Wu;Apostolos Papathanassiou;Mukherjee Udayan	2016	CoRR		embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;operating system;computer network	Mobile	-14.872900299950759	86.95103936867287	73551

Over the years many efforts have been devoted to securing the routing system and a plethora of solutions have been proposed. Yet none of the solutions has seen wide adoption in the operational Internet and the routing system security remains a serious concern. In this paper we articulate the fundamental challenges in rolling out new security solutions to the global routing system by categorizing the various proposed solutions into a few classes and identifying the difficulties and remaining issues in deploying each class of solutions. Our examination of the solution space shows that monitoring is an essential component in securing the routing system, and that the """"detect and react'' class of solutions have the lowest hurdle in deployment and thus are most readily acceptable by the network operational community."""	border gateway protocol;categorization;feasible region;internet;routing;software deployment	Ricardo V.

The simplicity in the design and implementation of QROUTE has been demonstrated by prototyping a router testbed, whose performance measured is presented in this paper. Compared to other QoS-based multicast routing protocols, QROUTE is more effective as it searches all the available feasible paths in parallel so as to ensure a better chance of successful routing and a more efficient use of network resources. We also evaluate the performance of QROUTE by comparing it with other related protocols through simulations, and find that it has lower blocking probability, lower routing overhead and lower set-up latency; the resulting multicast trees of QROUTE also generally require fewer links than those of the related protocols.	algorithm;blocking (computing);computer science;computerized speech lab;end-to-end principle;entityârelationship model;erlang (unit);functional specification;ibm i;ieee/acm transactions on networking;interrupt latency;klara nahrstedt;luna;li-chen wang;mbone;multicast;multipoint ground;multiprotocol label switching;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;prototype filter;quality of service;resource reservation protocol;router (computing);routing;simulation;testbed;tree rearrangement;virtual channel	Jinquan Dai;Hung Keng Pung;Touchai Angchuan	2002		10.1109/LCN.2002.1181771	real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;quality of service;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;probability;distributed computing;routing protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;statistics;computer network;multicast address	Networks	-4.5556452251195925	85.432156295234	74193

Using P2P (peer-to-peer) technology to transform architecture of the traditional IMS core network is a feasible solution, while the function separation and independent operation requirements of IMS network elements in telecommunication career level can not be met. In this paper, we present a multi-domain and multi-overlay framework of P2P IMS core network based on cloud infrastructure. In this framework, various network elements (NEs) are divided into different domains and overlay of the core network. Experimental results indicate that this framework can be deployed in the actual operating core network and provides core functions. Besides, the service capacity grows linearly as the number of serving nodes increases. The load can be automatically distributed on each element in a balanced way and the maximum load difference between elements is no more than 16%. Moreover, the response time of redesigned procedures is much smaller than the original procedures.	centralized computing;cloud computing;ip multimedia subsystem;load balancing (computing);multi-core processor;next-generation network;peer-to-peer;requirement;response time (technology);scalability;software deployment	Feng Lu;Jiao Song;Xiao Lei;Hai Jin;Zaiyang Tang;Xiaofei Liao;Fei Qiu	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage (NAS)	10.1109/NAS.2015.7255214	communications protocol;real-time computing;overlay network;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;processor register;computer security;server;computer network	HPC	-17.217490095875988	82.41711472884504	74272

In this context, we highlight a novel abstraction of the Internet topology, i.e., the inter-IXP multigraph composed of IXPs and paths crossing the domains of their shared member ISPs. This can potentially serve as a dense Internet-wide substrate for provisioning guaranteed end-to-end (e2e) services with high path diversity and global IPv4 address space reach. We thus map the IXP multigraph, evaluate its potential, and introduce a rich algorithmic framework for path stitching on such graph structures.	address space;centralized computing;end-to-end encryption;inter-domain;internet topology;multigraph;provisioning	Vasileios Kotronis;Rowan KlÃ¶ti;Matthias Rost;Panagiotis Georgopoulos;Bernhard Ager;Stefan Schmid;Xenofontas A.

While elegant from a theoretical perspective, these systems have some disadvantages. First, they rely on applicationlevel routing, which may be inefficient with respect to network delays and bandwidth consumption. Second, they typically construct a homogeneously structured overlay even though nodes in these networks usually have varying physical connectivity and packet-forwarding capacities. In this paper, we propose two approaches for constructing an auxiliary expressway network to take advantage of the different connectivity, forwarding capacities, and availabilities of the nodes. As a result, we are able to reconcile the conflict of presenting the applications with a homogeneous structured overlay to simplify management, while at the same time taking advantage of the inherent heterogeneity of the underlying physical network to speed up routing. Our simulation results show that our expressway can achieve close to optimal routing performance (on average, 1.07 and 1.41 times optimal routing for an Internet-like topology and a large synthesized transit-stub graph, respectively) in overlay networks.	border gateway protocol;cluster analysis;distributed hash table;fault tolerance;network packet;overlay network;routing;simulation	Zhichen Xu;Mallik Mahalingam;Magnus Karlsson	2003		10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1208985	pastry;routing table;routing;fault tolerance;static routing;real-time computing;the internet;overlay network;index term;computer science;chord;key-based routing;distributed computing;packet forwarding;network delay;network topology;computer network	Networks	-9.148357224827096	78.3835760393183	74417

In particular P2P applications are expected to gain from ALTO, due to the many connections peers form among each other, often without taking network layer topology information into account. In this paper, we present results of an extensive intra-ISP trial with an ALTO-enhanced P2P filesharing software. In summary, our results show thatâdepending on the concrete setting and on the distribution of upload capacity in the networkâALTO enables an ISP to save operational costs significantly while not degrading application layer performance noticeably. In addition, based on our experience we are able to give advice to operators on how to save costs with ALTO while not sacrificing application layer performance at all.	file sharing;peer-to-peer	Mischa Schmidt;Jan Seedorf;Stefano Napolitano;Rosario Giuseppe Garroppo;Andrea Cavaliere;Thilo Ewald;Armin Jahanpanah;Zbigniew Kopertowski;Marcin Pilarski;Pawel Grochocki	2013	Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications	10.1007/s12083-012-0133-y	simulation;telecommunications;database;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-11.147013386482891	86.16598442990316	74482

742f01b443f77225486504cf9b7f224b0fbd90f4	software defined industry automation networks		The recent advancement of industry automation is underpinned by the continuous development of the industrial network. This exponential growth is driving the fourth generation industry revolution (FGIR). To meet the requirement of FGIR, there is an ongoing evolution of industrial network from Fieldbus to Ethernet that has emerged a new opportunity to integrate Software Defined Networking (SDN) technique. In this paper, we propose a network architecture called Software Defined Industry Automation Network (SDIAN) to enable highly flexible and robust network. The proposed architecture promises to provide real-time communication, online dynamic configuration and flexible adaptation to changes in the connections and locations of the manufacturing entities. To validate the merit of the proposed framework, we also report on an ongoing testbed implementation on an experimental food processing plant demonstrator featuring Raspberry PIs (RPIs) instead of traditional Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).

We argue that these higher-layer exposures and bindings are the root of a large number of problems today, and present significant roadblocks to the evolution and deployment of future network architectures tomorrow. We address these problems by proposing a novel network architecture based around identifier indirection and translation between layers of the stack, and show how such an architecture (1) provides an attractive solution to problems today such as mobility and multi-homing by injecting additional flexibility into the existing network stack, (2) can be used to support the goals of future internet architecture (i.e. service-or information-centricity) within the existing network stack, and (3) relieves the ossification of the network stack and enables the incremental deployment of new protocols and layers.	application programming interface;experiment;future internet;identifier;indirection;internet protocol suite;language binding;multihoming;multiple homing;network architecture;protocol stack;proxy mobile ipv6;software deployment;unix domain socket	Spencer Sevilla	2015	2015 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)	10.1109/ICNP.2015.56	reference architecture;real-time computing;network architecture;computer science;applications architecture;operating system;transmission control protocol;distributed computing;multihoming;mobile computing;protocol stack;computer network	Networks	-15.711077707599895	83.54744129479853	74763

Most current community networks use wireless links for the node interconnection, applying off-the-shelf wireless equipment. While IP connectivity over the shared network infrastructure is successfully achieved, the deployment of applications in community networks is surprisingly low. To address the solution of this problem, we propose in this paper a service to incentivize the contribution of computing and storage as cloud resources to community networks, in order to stimulate the deployment of services and applications. Our final goal is the vision that in the long term, the users of community networks will not need to consume applications from the Internet, but find them within the wireless community network.	algorithm;cloud computing;community cloud;computational resource;experiment;future internet;interconnection;internet access;network model;software deployment;testbed	Ãmit Cavus BÃ¼yÃ¼ksahin;Amin M.

22c0c0f528e7b0969bd4aabc75de1ecefc2e9f06	exploiting locality in distributed sdn control	software defined networking;113 computer and information sciences;local algorithms;a4 article in conference publication refereed	Large SDN networks will be partitioned in multiple controller domains; each controller is responsible for one domain, and the controllers of adjacent domains may need to communicate to enforce global policies. This paper studies the implications of the local network view of the controllers. In particular, we establish a connection to the field of local algorithms and distributed computing, and discuss lessons for the design of a distributed control plane. We show that existing local algorithms can be used to develop efficient coordination protocols in which each controller only needs to respond to events that take place in its local neighborhood. However, while existing algorithms can be used, SDN networks also suggest a new approach to the study of locality in distributed computing. We introduce the so-called supported locality model of distributed computing. The new model is more expressive than the classical models that are commonly used in the design and analysis of distributed algorithms, and it is a better match with the features of SDN networks.	control plane;distributed algorithm;distributed computing;distributed control system;locality of reference;software-defined networking	Stefan Schmid;Jukka Suomela	2013		10.1145/2491185.2491198	distributed algorithm;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;software-defined networking;distributed design patterns;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-17.487408843748693	81.98366022010646	75049
b41ec79019c22436b1254ad7a04d8f3dc109daec	optimization of the implementation of network slicing in 5g ran		"""Slicing is an emergent technology for 5G. It decomposes a single Radio Access Network (RAN) into multiple virtual networks """"slices"""" to meet demands in term of throughput, mobility, latency, reliability, etc. Slicing needs real-time reconfigurations to keep current with demands' dynamics. This results in an increased cost of Operation Expenditures (OPEX). We approached this challenge as an optimization problem of infrastructure's resources. We virtualized and pooled Baseband Units (BBUs) resources on cloud. Dynamic allocation and interconnection with Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) are made possible by leveraging the advents of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-defined Networking (SDN). We implemented Distributed Base Station (DBS) using open software platform along to a public service orchestration tool for clouds. Our contribution is integrating service selection and deployment with real-time monitoring that allowed auto-control of resources by looping resources' lifecycle. In our experiments, we deployed several slices and we tested two scenarios. First scenario addressed slices' auto-scaling (Infrastructure Scale- Out/Scale-In) when free resources are available in the pool. Second scenario simulated slices' breathing (orchestration of resources) when the pool of resources is exhausted. In first scenario, results show that leveraging cloud elasticity by auto-scaling resources saves costs by providing exactly """"what-is-needed"""" """"when-it-is- needed"""" in term of cloud computing. In second scenario, results show that slices' breathing maximizes the usability by employing our """"inhale-and-exhale"""" heuristic. It is about reusing resources from under-loaded slices in favor of overloaded ones with seamless effect on the user-experience."""	algorithm;autoscaling;baseband;c-ran;cloud computing;decision tree;direct-broadcast satellite;etsi satellite digital radio;elasticity (cloud computing);emergence;end system;end-to-end encryption;experiment;function overloading;game theory;heuristic;image scaling;interconnection;mathematical optimization;memory management;network function virtualization;open-source software;operation payback;optimization problem;orchestration (computing);prototype;radio access network;real-time clock;scorpion (cpu);seamless3d;simulation;software deployment;software-defined networking;throughput;universal software radio peripheral;usability;user experience	Nazih Salhab;Salah El Falou;Rana Rahim;Salah Eddine El Ayoubi;Rami Langar	2018	2018 IEEE Middle East and North Africa Communications Conference (MENACOMM)	10.1109/MENACOMM.2018.8371035	software deployment;orchestration (computing);real-time computing;cost of operation;radio access network;operating expense;cloud computing;slicing;computer science;base station	Mobile	-14.323063884270441	84.11114188935726	75052
d39125aa383af11038ea000093d92bb94446d72b	performance guarantee aware orchestration for service function chains with elastic demands		In this paper, we study how to provide optimal performance guarantee in multi-resource scenarios, such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV), where Virtual Network Function (VNF) resource demands of one Service Function Chain (SFC) are elastic and correlated with the end-to-end throughput of SFC. Previous works such as Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF) achieve this goal only if the demands are already orchestrated to dedicated resource instances. However, how to orchestrate SFC to VNF instances is a key issue in NFV. Few previous works have investigated the relationship between them. In this paper, we consider the problem of SFC orchestration subject to DRF allocation scheme so as to find the orchestration scheme with optimal performance guarantee. We analyze it and model it as SFC Performance Guarantee (SFC-PG) problem, followed by a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation. We design a heuristic Performance Guarantee Aware Orchestration (PGAO) to solve it in large scale cases. We conduct simulations with a variety of circumstances and parameters, and the results demonstrate that PGAO achieves better performance compared to existing solutions.	approximation algorithm;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;heuristic;linear programming;network function virtualization;orchestration (computing);simulation;space-filling curve;throughput	Tao Wen;Hong-Fang Yu;Xiaojiang Du	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN)	10.1109/NFV-SDN.2017.8169854	orchestration (computing);throughput;noise measurement;software-defined networking;virtual network;real-time computing;resource management;computer science;heuristic;integer programming	Networks	-10.80971485258527	81.99441900125686	75090
ddd8a9922128b79ae5a15f82461800ad4118d863	caracterizaÃ§Ã£o de tempos de ida-e-volta na internet		Round-trip times (RTTs) are an important metric for the operation of many applications in the Internet. For instance, they are taken into account when choosing servers or peers in streaming systems, and they impact the operation of fault detectors and congestion control algorithms. Therefore, detailed knowledge about RTTs is important for application and protocol developers. In this work we present results on measuring RTTs between 81 PlanetLab nodes every ten seconds, for ten days. The resulting dataset has over 550 million measurements. Our analysis gives us a profile of delays in the network and identifies a Gamma distribution as the model that best fits our data. The average times observed are below 500 ms in more than 99% of the pairs, but there is significant variation, not only when we compare different pairs of hosts during the experiment, but also considering any given pair of hosts over time. By using a clustering technique, we observe that links can be divided in five distinct groups based on the distribution of RTTs over time and the losses observed, ranging from groups of near, wellconnected pairs, to groups of distant hosts, with lower quality links between them.	algorithm;cluster analysis;fits;geforce;internet;network congestion;numerical aperture;planetlab;sensor	Everthon Valadao;Dorgival O.

Reducing traffic is also important because power consumption in networks has been increasing yearly year. Therefore, in-network caching is beneficial in view of energy-efficiency. However, in order to improve energy efficiency of the network, it is necessary to cache content appropriately in consideration of both power consumption of content caching and transmission of traffic. Moreover for a distributed cache framework such as CCN, content caching should be autonomously controlled by distributed cache nodes. In this paper, we propose a distributed cache management mechanism to control energy-efficient cache locations of content. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism by simulations.	cache (computing);cyclomatic complexity;digital distribution;distributed cache;least frequently used;norm (social);router (computing);simulation	Satoshi Imai;Kenji Leibnitz;Masayuki Murata	2013	2013 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops	10.1109/WAINA.2013.70	bus sniffing;distributed algorithm;real-time computing;cache coloring;cache stampede;energy conservation;cache;computer science;resource management;cache invalidation;operating system;distributed computing;smart cache;cache algorithms;cache pollution;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network;principal component analysis;memory management	HPC	-14.349884058183335	74.55573137394073	75162

A multicast routing request consists of a source s, a set of receivers R, and a bandwidth requirement b. This multicast routing problem arises in many contexts. Two applications of interest are routing of point-to-multipoint label-switched paths in multiprotocol label switched (MPLS) networks, and the provision of bandwidth-guaranteed virtual private network (VPN) services under the """"hose"""" service model [18]. Offline multicast routing algorithms cannot be used since they require a priori knowledge of all multicast requests that are to be routed. Instead, online algorithms that handle requests arriving one by one and that satisfy as many potential future demands as possible are needed. The newly developed algorithm is an online algorithm and is based on the idea that a newly routed multicast must follow a route that does not interfere too much with network paths that may be critical to satisfy future demands. We develop a multicast tree selection heuristic that is based on the idea of deferred loading of certain critical links. These critical links are identified by the algorithm as links that, if heavily loaded, would make it impossible to satisfy future demands between certain ingress-egress pairs. The presented algorithm uses link-state information and some auxiliary capacity information for multicast tree selection and is amenable to distributed implementation. Unlike previous algorithms, the proposed algorithm exploits any available knowledge of the network ingress-egress points of potential future demands, even though the demands themselves are unknown, and performs very well."""	egress filtering;flow network;heuristic;link-state routing protocol;multicast;multipoint ground;multiprotocol label switching;online algorithm;online and offline;point-to-multipoint communication;r language;virtual private network	Murali S.

9766667e74f08e04f0b32c332256f2b620d24099	a cost-effective low-latency overlaid torus-based data center network architecture		Abstract In this paper, we present the design, analysis, and implementation of a novel data center network architecture named CLOT , which delivers significant reduction in the network diameter, network latency, and infrastructure cost. CLOT is built based on a switchless torus topology by adding only a number of most beneficial low-end switches in a proper way. Forming the servers in close proximity of each other in torus topology well implements the network locality. The extra layer of switches largely shortens the average routing path length of torus network, which increases the communication efficiency. We show that CLOT can achieve lower latency, smaller routing path length, higher bisection bandwidth and throughput, and better fault tolerance compared to both conventional hierarchical data center networks as well as the recently proposed CamCube network. Coupled with the coordinate based geographical addresses and credit based flow control, the specially designed POW routing algorithm helps CLOT achieve its maximum theoretical performance. Besides, an automatic address configuration mechanism and malfunction detection mechanism are provided to facilitate the network deployment and configuration. The sufficient mathematical analysis and theoretical derivation prove both guaranteed and ideal performance of CLOT .	data center;network architecture	Ting Wang;Lu Wang;Mounir Hamdi	2018	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2018.07.021	throughput;computer network;network architecture;latency (engineering);path length;computer science;latency (engineering);bisection bandwidth;grid network;flow control (data)	Networks	-11.084702963579192	80.40992131900963	75427

2763e2551007cd718c1879910ac340f1328c6bd3	bringing energy aware routing closer to reality with sdn hybrid networks		Energy aware routing aims at reducing the energy consumption of ISP networks. The idea is to adapt routing to the traffic load in order to turn off some hardware. However, it implies to make dynamic changes to routing configurations which is almost impossible with legacy protocols. The Software Defined Network (SDN) paradigm bears the promise of allowing a dynamic optimization with its centralized controller. In this work, we propose SENAtoR, an algorithm to enable energy aware routing in a scenario of progressive migration from legacy to SDN hardware. Since in real life, turning off network equipments is a delicate task as it can lead to packet losses, SENAtoR provides also several features to safely enable energy saving services: tunneling for fast rerouting, smooth node disabling and detection of both traffic spikes and link failures. We validate our solution by extensive simulations and by experimentation. We show that SENAtoR can be progressively deployed in a network using the SDN paradigm. It allows to reduce the energy consumption of ISP networks by 5 to 35% depending on the penetration of SDN hardware, while diminishing the packet loss rate compared to legacy protocols.	algorithm;centralized computing;dynamic programming;emulator;experiment;fault tolerance;lossless compression;mathematical optimization;network packet;programming paradigm;real life;routing;sensor;simulation;software-defined networking;tunneling protocol;web traffic	Nicolas Huin;Myriana Rifai;FrÃ©dÃ©ric Giroire;Dino Lopez Pacheco;Guillaume Urvoy-Keller;Joanna Moulierac	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254456	computer network;real-time computing;link-state routing protocol;dynamic source routing;computer science;packet loss;geographic routing;static routing;software-defined networking;routing protocol;convergence (routing)	Mobile	-12.591704266392997	83.1151878359081	75701

A sequence of requests arrives over time, each is a pair of nodes to be connected by a path. The problem is to assign a wavelength and a path to each pair, so that no two paths sharing a link are assigned the same wavelength. The goal is to minimize the number of wavelengths used to establish all connections. Raghavan and Upfal RU94] considered the oo-line version of the problem, which was further studied in AR95, KP96, MKR95, Ra96]. For a line topology, the problem is the well-studied interval graph coloring problem. On-line algorithms for this problem have been analyzed in KT81]. We consider trees, trees of rings, and meshes topologies. previously studied in the oo-line case. We give on-line algorithms with competitive ratio O(log n) for all these topologies. We give a matching (log n) lower bound for meshes. We also prove that any algorithm for trees cannot have competitive ratio better than (log n log log n). We also consider the problem where every edge is associated with parallel links. While in WDM technology, a ber link requires diierent wavelengths for every transmission, SDM (space division multiplexing) technology allows parallel links for a single wavelength, at an additional cost. Thus, it may be beneecial in terms of network economics to combine between the two technologies (this is indeed done in practice). For arbitrary networks with (log n) parallel links we give an on-line algorithm with competitive ratio O(log n).	competitive analysis (online algorithm);graph coloring;online algorithm;online and offline;routing;wavelength-division multiplexing;whole earth 'lectronic link	Yair Bartal;Stefano Leonardi	1999	Theor.

Limiting the range of wavelengths that can be accessed at a node reduces costs. In this paper, we study wavelength assignment (WA) in WDM bi-directional ring networks with limited reconfigurability and take up the problem of supporting two traffic types - permutation traffic and all-to-all traffic - while minimizing the worst-case wavelength range of the ROADMs and respecting the wavelength termination and continuity constraints. ROADMs can be limited in tuning range (L-ROADMs) or have full range (F- ROADMs). In this work, a node can either possess a limited-add L-ROADM or an F-ROADM. For permutation traffic, we show that at least one F-ROADM is necessary, and we also give an upper bound on the number of F-ROADMs needed as a function of the range of L-ROADMs at other nodes. For all-to-all traffic, we develop an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation, and also propose a new wavelength assignment algorithm that uses Wu = N2/4 - N/2 + 1/4 wavelengths. Our heuristic's results are similar to the ILP's. The results show that a saving of 85-93.3% in tuning range is achievable for this type of traffic.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;multiplexer;reconfigurability;scott continuity;wavelength-division multiplexing	Majid Alnaimi;Suresh Subramaniam	2008	2008 Proceedings of 17th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks	10.1109/ICCCN.2008.ECP.94	ring network;integer programming;telecommunications;computer science;upper and lower bounds;optical switch;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network	Theory	-5.487324328863255	81.40919733597795	75983

For such a network we investigate the influence of traffic shaping at the edge nodes, as introduced by optical burst generation algorithms, on the packet drop rate at the core nodes. In particular we focus our attention on the impact of the algorithms that generate fixed-size optical bursts, i.e., volume-based burst assembly. The simulative investigation reveals that the total number of burst flows multiplexed at the core node under consideration as well as the assembly threshold are the two most influential factors, and that the influence of these factors on the drop rate could be as high as several orders of magnitude. Additionally, it is discussed that the assembly process can negatively influence the performance of the so-called void-filling channel scheduling algorithms.	delay line memory;gnu free documentation license;hybrid algorithm;multiplexing;network packet;noise shaping;optical burst switching;orthogonal polarization spectral imaging;packet switching;scheduling (computing);the void (virtual reality);timer;traffic exchange;traffic shaping	Ahmad Rostami;Adam Wolisz	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.382	real-time computing;genetic algorithm;optical burst switching;fast packet switching;telecommunications;computer science;cut-through switching;transmission delay;scheduling;traffic shaping;optical performance monitoring;burst switching;packet switching;circuit switching;telecommunications network;computer network	Robotics	-5.915442016694928	85.35374508538686	76041

Indeed, several authors have observed that the blocking rate is often unchanged even with the addition of converters depending on the traffic instances and the network topology. For this reason, some authors, e.g., Ramaswami and Sasaki (1998) or Erlebach and Stefanakos (2003) have investigated further the usefulness or the impact of adding converters. In this study, we pursue in this direction and investigate two issues: performing some preprocessing tests when solving the RWA problem with/without conversion by identifying, at the outset, some lightpaths that will be present in the optimal solution, and some of the patterns that the traffic instances must contain in order to observe an advantage of adding converters. Conclusions are that quite particular traffic patterns must be present in order for wavelength conversion to be useful, and in that case, it is sufficient to have conversion features at a very limited number of nodes	blocking (computing);network topology;preprocessor;routing and wavelength assignment;spectral efficiency	Brigitte Jaumard;Christophe Meyer;Xiao Yu	2005	GLOBECOM '05.

8a647f9891efab639c03c33f9a92066ab0d66802	reserved energy-aware virtual topology management for ip-over-wdm optical networks		Abstract Virtual topology reconfiguration addresses the issue of overprovisioning in IP-over-WDM optical backbone networks. Contrary to maintaining a static virtual topology, adapting the virtual topology to the dynamic load of the network achieves notable energy savings. Although the goals of energy efficiency and high performance are usually achieved, such schemes suffer from a significant performance degradation, because they overlook the impact of the reconfiguration process. In this work, a novel threshold-based reconfiguration algorithm is introduced, which overcomes the above problem by taking into account the impact of reconfiguration. The proposed RVTM (Reserved Virtual Topology Management) scheme introduces a new threshold system and a new relaxed reconfiguration policy. The new algorithm is focused on reducing the volume of reconfigurations needed to maintain an energy-efficient network, as well as the number of served traffic demands which are affected by the reconfiguration process. Extensive simulation experiments are presented, which demonstrate the benefits obtained by the use of the proposed algorithm, in comparison to the original strict threshold based reconfiguration policy. RVTM yields up to 40% energy savings, while decreasing the number of reconfigurations up to 77%. Additionally, the proposed algorithm reduces significantly the number of rerouted traffic demands and improves the lightpath interconnection.		Panagiotis Melidis;Petros Nicopolitidis;Georgios I.

OpenFlow, as an implementation of SDN, provides flexible and abstracted approach to configure SDN networks. This Paper focuses on failure recovery mechanism using OpenFlow. The proposed mechanism is divided into: (a) computing the working paths proactively between each source-destination pair and return a list of paths ordered by-path latency from shortest to longest path, (b)implement per-Link Bidirectional Forwarding Detection(BFD) for failure detection, to enable fast detection time, thus fast recovery time, (d) configure OpenFlow Fast Failover Group for restoration such that, the highest-priority bucket to be linked to the shortest path, the second highest-priority bucket linked to the second shortest path and so on. Upon failure, the switch will revert to the second fastest path, (e) to achieve high resource utilization, OpenFlow Select Group used to split the flow among the working paths. The proposed architecture of this work provides high utilization of network resources in addition to efficient fast detection and recovery time. As the evaluation shows, the usage of multipath routing with fast failover scheme provide much resource utilization and fast recovery time.	binary file descriptor library;circuit restoration;experiment;failover;fastest;longest path problem;multipath routing;network congestion;openflow;programming paradigm;shortest path problem;software-defined networking;throughput	Aiman Ghannami;Chenxi Shao	2016	2016 11th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST)	10.1109/ICITST.2016.7856747	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-13.058566531569225	82.75883940029868	76254

In this work, we propose MCRM, a two-stage virtual network embedding (VNE) algorithm with delay and placement constraints. Our solution revolves around a novel notion of similarity between virtual and physical nodes. To this end, taking advantage of Markov Reward theory, we define a set of metrics for each physical and virtual node which captures the amount of resources in a node neighborhood as well as the degree of proximity among nodes. By defining a notion of similarity between nodes we then simply map virtual nodes to the most similar physical node in the substrate network. We have thoroughly evaluated our algorithm through simulation. Our experiments show that MCRM achieves good performance results in terms of blocking probability and revenues for the InP, as well as a high and uniform utilization of resources, while satisfying the delay and placement requirements.	algorithm;blocking (computing);cloud computing;erlang (unit);experiment;heuristic;markov chain;requirement;simulation	Francesco Bianchi;Francesco Lo Presti	2017	SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review	10.1145/3092819.3092827	quality of service;cloud computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-9.06565250313022	82.49387832327461	76323

Simultaneously with, this growth has increased significantly the problems of network management. Especially in small companies, where there is no provision of personnel assigned to these tasks, the management of such networks is often complex and malfunctions can have significant impacts on their businesses. A possible solution is the adoption of Simple Network Management Protocol. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a standard protocol used to exchange network management information. It is part of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol suite. SNMP provides a tool for network administrators to manage network performance, find and solve network problems, and plan for network growth. SNMP has a big disadvantage: its simple design means that the information it deals with is neither detailed nor well organized enough to deal with the expanding modern networking requirements. Over the past years much efforts has been given to improve the lack of Simple Network Management Protocol and new frameworks has been developed: A promising approach involves the use of Ontology. This is the starting point of this paper where a novel approach to the network management based on the use of the Slow Intelligence System methodologies and Ontology based techniques is proposed. Slow Intelligence Systems is a general-purpose systems characterized by being able to improve performance over time through a process involving enumeration, propagation, adaptation, elimination and concentration. Therefore, the proposed approach aims to develop a system able to acquire, according to an SNMP standard, information from the various hosts that are in the managed networks and apply solutions in order to solve problems. To check the feasibility of this model first experimental results in a real scenario are showed.	simple network management protocol	Francesco Colace;Massimo De Santo;Salvatore Ferrandino	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-17604-3_9	out-of-band management;fcaps;element management system;network traffic control;intelligent computer network;wireless wan;network architecture;network management station;internet layer;dynamic circuit network;tunneling protocol;network simulation;distributed computing;network management application;internet protocol suite;structure of management information;common management information protocol;multihoming;computer security;network monitoring;computer network	AI	-18.79248343130208	85.42968695074785	76643

The former cannot switch circuits of capacity lower than STS-48 without the help of external grooming devices, and consumes high fragmented/unused capacity to support low capacity end to end circuits using high capacity STS-48 channels. The latter almost eliminates such capacity wastage by supporting STS-1 level switching, but involves larger switching delays leading to slower restoration and requires more complicated hardware design that decreases switch scalability with increasing port count.  This paper proposes an intelligent packing and routing algorithm in a network architecture which contains both kinds of switches configured in two tiers, and compares it with the other two network architectures - one with only wavelength switches with STS-48 granularity, and another with only grooming switches with STS-1 switching granularity. It is shown that the two-tier architecture with our routing scheme is comparable in capacity efficiency to the STS-1 only network, while its scalability and restoration delays are at par with the STS-48 only network.  Furthermore, we propose a partial two-tier network architecture where the functionality of STS-1 grooming is deployed at a subset of the network nodes. Our simulations show that the capacity efficiency of this architecture does not decrease significantly with reduction in the number of STS-1 switch equipped nodes.	algorithm;circuit restoration;data rate units;mesh networking;multitier architecture;network architecture;network switch;network topology;next-generation network;optical mesh network;optical switch;routing;scalability;set packing;simulation;synchronous optical networking;throughput;timir datta;wavelength-division multiplexing	Somdip Datta;Subir K.

However, scalability constraints force individual networks to only have a local view of the Internet's routing state. This lack of global view hinders the troubleshooting of Internet routing problems and limits the routing choices of network operators. In this paper, we propose a p2p-based infrastructure for the Internet-wide management of interdomain routing. Peers dispersed in various Internet sites collect information from the participating networks and exchange knowledge in the event of a routing problem. Thus, the infrastructure as a whole carries a global routing view. Participating networks use this infrastructure in order to obtain an insight on remote routing events and potentially respond accordingly. Our approach is novel in that it exploits the peer-to-peer paradigm for routing management purposes. The proposed infrastructure is resilient in terms of information availability, self-organizing, lightweight, and easily deployable. We illustrate the need, design, and benefits of such a management infrastructure.	inter-domain;internet;organizing (structure);peer-to-peer;programming paradigm;routing;scalability;self-organization	Kyriaki Levanti;Hyong S.

Nevertheless, its home registration process introduces an overhead in the local-area mobility case. A Mobile Host is required to register with its possibly distant Home Agent, whenever it changes its point of attachment to the network. Foreign Agent hierarchies have been introduced to perform Regional Mobile IP registration to minimize the home registration signaling overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel configurable architecture to organize cooperating Foreign Agent hierarchies in the foreign domain. An attempt is made not to change the Mobile Host home registered care-of address as long as it is within the foreign domain. In such manner, home registration signaling overhead is minimized, and the Home Agent is isolated from any local-area movement by the Mobile Host.	attachments;care-of address;encapsulation (networking);foreign key;internet;interoperability;message authentication;mobile ip;modified huffman coding;overhead (computing);replay attack;simulation	Ayman Abdel-Hamid;Hussein M.

This article investigates a solution for rearchitecting a telecommunications company's (telco's) central office to offer services in a smart community, enabled by virtual network function elements running on a smart edge. At the same time, these elements manage a multiaccess underlying infrastructure and deploy telco services with minimal resource consumption. This solution has successfully been implemented in a living lab model the authors built within a Canadian university, providing various Internet of Things (IoT) services such as smart grid monitoring and public safety. The virtual smart edge flexibly routes traffic, aggregates, and splits flows across a heterogeneous network to achieve network operational efficiency, as well as optimizes computing resource allocation for last-mile IoT services hosted close to the end user. Instead of reducing resource consumption in a single home as in the traditional approach, this solution minimizes a community's global consumption.	internet of things;last mile;living lab;multitenancy;transfer function	Kim Khoa Nguyen;Mohamed Cheriet	2016	IEEE Internet Computing	10.1109/MIC.2016.127	network functions virtualization;computer science;resource management;software-defined networking;law;world wide web;computer security;internet of things;computer network	Networks	-15.166967847820592	85.27719502158034	77474

It may also be used to reduce the number of wavelengths required for a given tolerable blocking probability. Simulation results show that our wavelength assignment algorithm performs better than other previously proposed algorithms (in the cases we studied). As the number of fibers per link increases, the benefit of having wavelength converters decreases dramaticulb, and the pevformance improvement of our algorithm over others increases. Our results also show that in case a preferred path is not available, rerouting along a node-disjoint backup path can signijicantly reduce the blocking probability.	algorithm;backup;bandwidth (signal processing);blocking (computing);capacity loss;digital back-propagation;erlang (unit);online and offline;simulation;wavelength-division multiplexing	Xijun Zhang;Chunming Qiao	1998		10.1109/ICCCN.1998.739952	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;wavelength-division multiplexing;statistics;computer network	AI	-5.518437310540582	83.09011266426262	77641

Optical Network on Chip (ONoC) is considered as a promising interconnection technology for future multicore processors, due to its remarkable advantages of high bandwidth capacity and transmission speed. However, traditional multicast schemes cannot well utilize the limited number of wavelength channels in ONoC. In this paper, we propose a novel multicast scheme, DWRMR, based on Dynamically-established and Wavelength-Reusable Multicast Rings. In DWRMR, the multicast ring, which connects the source core with all destinations via a cyclic routing path, is dynamically constructed for each multicast group. Then multicast packets are transmitted in the manner of single-send-multi-receive using only single wavelength. The same wavelength can also be reused in link-disjoint multicast rings. Most importantly, in our scheme the established multicast ring can be shared among cores in the same multicast group for interactive multicast traffic via optical-token arbitration, which avoids setting up exclusive multicast routing paths for each core. We formulate the multicast ring routing and wavelength allocation problem as an integer linear programming problem, and propose a heuristic algorithm that is able to accommodate more multicast rings under the wavelength limitation. Simulation results indicate that DWRMR can reduce more than 50% of packet delay with slight hardware cost, or require only half number of wavelengths to achieve the same performance, compared with existing schemes.	algorithm;central processing unit;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;interconnection;linear programming;multi-core processor;multicast;network on a chip;network packet;optical network on chip;overhead (computing);routing;simulation	Feiyang Liu;Haibo Zhang;Yawen Chen;Zhiyi Huang;Huaxi Gu	2016	2016 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip (MCSOC)	10.1109/MCSoC.2016.9	link state packet;multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Arch	-5.941675786748337	83.23289851034924	78216
2dcdacffd7d4660899dee4699039ec3f7c5fb3ed	real-time network function virtualization with timing interfaces		"""More and more infrastructure is becoming virtualized. Recently this trend has begun to include network functions - such as firewalls, WAN optimizers, and intrusion prevention systems - that have traditionally been implemented as middleboxes using dedicated hardware. This trend towards network function virtualization (NFV) offers a variety of potential benefits that resemble those of cloud computing, including consolidation, easier management, higher efficiency, and better scalability. However, current cloud technology is not a perfect match for NFV workloads: since the infrastructure is shared, the time it takes for a packet to pass through a particular function is no longer predictable, and can in fact vary considerably. This is causing headaches for operators, who can no longer treat network functions as """"bumps in the wire"""" and must now consider a complex web of possible interactions and cross-talk when operating or diagnosing their systems.  In this position paper, we propose a compositional approach towards building a scalable NFV platform that can provide latency and throughput guarantees using timing interfaces. We discuss our preliminary results that leverage and extend recent advances on timing interfaces and compositional theory from the real-time systems domain to the NFV setting, and we highlight open challenges and potential directions towards real-time NFV."""	cloud computing;crosstalk;firewall (computing);hardware virtualization;interaction;intrusion detection system;middlebox;network function virtualization;network packet;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;scalability;semiconductor consolidation;throughput;transfer function;wan optimization	Linh T.

Our scheme makes use of masks that are contiguous but not prefix-based to provide significant improvements in performance., Our Cyclic Block Allocation (CBA) scheme shares some similarities with both Reverse Bit Expansion and kampai, but overcomes many shortcomings associated with these earlier techniques by exploiting techniques from the area of subcube allocation for hypercubes. Through static analysis and dynamic simulations, we show that CBA has the following characteristics that make it an excellent candidate for practical use in interdomain multicast protocols: better address utilization under dynamic requests and releases than other schemes; low blocking time; efficient routing tables; addresses reflect domain hierarchy; and compatibility with MASC architecture.

In burst segmentation, rather than dropping the entire burst during contention, the burst may be partitioned into multiple segments, and only the overlapping segments are dropped. The segmentation scheme is investigated in conjunction with a deflection scheme through simulation, and it is shown that segmentation with deflection can achieve a significantly reduced packet loss rate.	burst error;end-to-end principle;memory segmentation;network congestion;network packet;quality of service;retransmission (data networks);shortest path problem;simulation	Vinod Vokkarane;Jason P.

They support both packet/ IP services and circuit/wavelength services. Packet services include traditional data services such as VPN, VoIP, and email, while dynamic circuit services include end-to-end bandwidth-intensive applications such as terascale science experiments. In present hybrid networks, such as ESnet, the bandwidth boundary between the circuit and packet sections of the network is fixed. However, a flexible boundary between the circuit and packet sections will enable cost-efficient bandwidth management in the network. Our study investigates two methods to dynamically migrate capacity between the circuit and packet sections, called vertical stacking and horizontal partitioning, and serves as a tutorial. In vertical stacking, the backup capacity of wavelength circuits can be dynamically exchanged between packet and wavelength services while ensuring survivability. The backup capacity can be used to protect wavelength services in the event of a failure and route packet traffic otherwise. In horizontal partitioning, the excess capacity on links in the packet section can be loaned to circuit services. We have conducted experiments using a snapshot of real traffic on ESnet with horizontal partitioning. Control mechanisms for our approaches that can be operational in ESnet are presented.	backup;bandwidth management;coexist (image);cost efficiency;email;end-to-end principle;experiment;focus stacking;future internet;hybrid integrated circuit;network packet;offset binary;partition (database);snapshot (computer storage);terascale (microarchitecture);vertical blanking interval;virtual private network	Chaitanya S.

022d08b1416f01035d8321d4afce47df9c2b32a4	minimization of the receiver cost in an all-optical ring with a limited number of wavelengths		A new all-optical node architecture, known as Packet Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer (POADM), may lead to a considerable cost reduction for the infrastructure of the all-optical metropolitan rings if associated with proper dimensioning studies. We present a dimensioning problem which consists of minimizing the total number of receivers located in POADMs for a metropolitan all-optical ring with a fixed number of wavelengths and a given traffic matrix. We prove that this problem is NPcomplete and provide a heuristic. The heuristic principle is to match and to group transmissions instead of considering them independently. We justify the transmission group matching approach by confronting the results of our algorithm with its simplified version. The results obtained allow us to recommend the heuristic in the planning of POADM configurations in alloptical rings with a limited number of wavelengths.	algorithm;converge;heuristic;mathematical optimization;np-completeness;optical add-drop multiplexer;optimization problem;simulation	David Poulain;Joanna Tomasik;Marc-Antoine Weisser;Dominique Barth	2012		10.1007/978-1-4471-4594-3_25	mathematical optimization;statistics	ML	-5.223992921848695	81.59874263465873	79093

Such functions often are considered as virtualized version of physical devices. They follow the same implementation, deployment, and operation and management model as such physical entities. However, some key characteristics of the underlying cloud technologies, such as the elastic provisioning of resources, the different hardware failure rates and the increasing programmability of the underlying network enable new design paradigms. Thus, virtual network functions should leverage on IT technologies like Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) to reduce operational costs and enable new business models. We introduce a classification of different design paradigms, detail how a SaaS implementation can be performed for mobile network gateways, and provide a comparison of the operation cost implications of employing such paradigms to create network nodes in a mobile network.	amazon elastic compute cloud (ec2);cloud computing;electronic product code;entity;gateway (telecommunications);hardware virtualization;multitenancy;network function virtualization;network packet;peripheral;programming paradigm;provisioning;software as a service;software deployment	Wolfgang Kiess;Xueli An;Sergio Beker	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7416944	radio access network;embedded system;intelligent network;mobile search;intelligent computer network;network architecture;mobile web;mobile telephony;network management station;cloud computing;public land mobile network;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;software as a service;network simulation;distributed computing;network management application;mobile computing;computational model;provisioning;computer network	Mobile	-15.724001916480514	85.18020457705134	79108

Based on an organizational framework and on an open connectivity service architecture, an opportunistic resources management service is proposed, which exploits network conditions and node capabilities to improve connectivity. This service is able to orchestrate adequate connectivity mechanisms, such as access provisioning, mesh forwarding and Internet gateway ones, in multi-radio nodes.

d018c93349c52a09d5c479d405456c9f90ac329d	neural network meets dcn: traffic-driven topology adaptation with deep learning		The emerging optical/wireless topology reconfiguration technologies have shown great potential in improving the performance of data center networks. However, it also poses a big challenge on how to find the best topology configurations to support the dynamic traffic demands. In this work, we present xWeaver, a traffic-driven deep learning solution to infer the high-performance network topology online. xWeaver supports a powerful network model that enables the topology optimization over different performance metrics and network architectures. With the design of properly-structured neural networks, it can automatically derive the critical traffic patterns from data traces and learn the underlying mapping between the traffic patterns and topology configurations specific to the target data center. After offline training, xWeaver generates the optimized (or near-optimal) topology configuration online, and can also smoothly update its model parameters for new traffic patterns. We build an optical-circuit-switch-based testbed to demonstrate the function and transmission efficiency of our proposed solution. We further perform extensive simulations to show the significant performance gain of xWeaver, in supporting higher network throughput and smaller flow completion time.	artificial neural network;data center;deep learning;dynamic circuit network;experiment;mathematical optimization;network model;network topology;online and offline;simulation;smoothing;testbed;throughput;topology optimization;tracing (software)	Mowei Wang;Yong Cui;Shihan Xiao;Xin Wang;Dan Yang;Kai Chen;Jun Zhu	2018	POMACS	10.1145/3224421	deep learning;wireless;network topology;network architecture;control reconfiguration;artificial neural network;distributed computing;network model;topology optimization;artificial intelligence;computer science;topology	Metrics	-14.041919459988408	79.66865506315101	79178
e820bd661a21f88c20aadea213918d88148cd313	wireless networks for mobile edge computing: spatial modeling and latency analysis		Next-generation wireless networks will provide users ubiquitous low-latency computing services using devices at the network edge, called mobile edge computing (MEC). The key operation of MEC is to offload computation intensive tasks from users. Since each edge device comprises an access point (AP) and a computer server (CS), an MEC network can be decomposed as a radio access network cascaded with a CS network. Based on the architecture, we investigate network-constrained latency performance, namely communication latency and computation latency, under the constraints of radio-access connectivity and CS stability. To this end, a spatial random network is modeled featuring random node distribution, parallel computing, non-orthogonal multiple access, and random computation-task generation. Given the model and the said network constraints, we derive the scaling laws of communication latency and computation latency with respect to network-load parameters (density of mobiles and their task-generation rates) and network-resource parameters (bandwidth, density of APs/CSs, and CS computation rate). Essentially, the analysis involves the interplay of the theories of stochastic geometry, queueing, and parallel computing. Combining the derived scaling laws quantifies the tradeoffs between the latencies, network connectivity, and network stability. The results provide useful guidelines for MEC-network provisioning and planning by avoiding either of the cascaded radio access network or CS network being a performance bottleneck.	cascading style sheets;computation;edge computing;edge device;parallel computing;provisioning;radio access network;random graph;randomized algorithm;serial digital video out;server (computing);theory;wireless access point	Seung-Woo Ko;Kaifeng Han;Kaibin Huang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2018.2840120	edge device;wireless network;computer network;latency (engineering);radio access network;architecture;mobile edge computing;mathematics;provisioning;server	Metrics	-13.056137191148565	86.01544651903296	79256

Considerable efforts have been made by both academia and industry on P2P streaming design. While academia mostly focus on exploring design space to approach the theoretical performance bounds, our recent measurement study on several commercial P2P streaming systems indicates that they are able to deliver good user Quality of Experience with seemingly simple designs. One intriguing question remains:how elaborate should a good P2P video streaming design be? Towards answering this question, we developed and implemented several representative P2P streaming designs, ranging from theoretically proved optimal designs to straightforward ânaiveâ designs. Through an extensive comparison study on PlanetLab, we unveil several key factors contributing to the successes of simple P2P streaming designs, including system resource index, server capacity and chunk scheduling rule, peer download buffering and peering degree. We also identify regions where naive designs are inadequate and more elaborate designs can improve things considerably. Our study not only brings us better understandings and more insights into the operation of existing systems, it also sheds lights on the design of future systems that can achieve a good balance between the performance and the complexity.	complexity;download;multicast;optimal design;peer-to-peer;peering;planetlab;scheduling (computing);server (computing);streaming media	Chao Liang;Yang Guo;Yong Liu	2009	IEEE Trans.

On the arrival of a connection request, an RRA algorithm selects a route for the connection and allocates an appropriate rate on the route; failing this, it blocks the connection request. We measure the performance of an RRA algorithm in terms of its minimum weighted carried traffic. This performance criterion encompasses two widely used performance criteria, namely, weighted carried traffic and minimum carried traffic. We derive an upper bound on the minimum weighted carried traffic of anyRRA algorithm. The bound can be computed by solving a linear program. Moreover, we show that the bound is achieved asymptotically, when the offered load and the link capacities are large, by a Partitioning RRA algorithm. Therefore the bound can be used as a performance benchmark for any RRA algorithm. We observe that the proposed Partitioning RRA algorithm, though asymptotically optimal, performs poorly at very low loads.

However, LISP was originally designed in the fixed network environment rather than in the mobile network environment. In particular, the existing LISP mobility schemes are based on a centralized map server that is used as an anchor point for mobile nodes, and thus intrinsically subject to some limitations in mobile environment. In this paper, we propose a distributed mapping management of Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Locators (LOCs) in mobile LISP networks. We use Routing LOC (RLOC) and Local LOC (LLOC) as locators for mobile hosts. RLOC represents the IP address of the domain gateway, and LLOC is the IP address of the access router that a host is currently attached to. For EID-LOC mapping management, each network domain has a Distributed Map Server (DMS) over its gateway. Each DMS keeps track of the EID-LOC mapping information for mobile hosts in the distributed way. The proposed scheme is also a network-based approach, in which each access router, instead of a host, performs the mapping management operations. From the performance analysis, we can see that the proposed distributed scheme can give better performance than the existing schemes in terms of the signaling delays required for EID-LOC mapping update and query operations.	altered level of consciousness;comefrom;centralized computing;communication endpoint;identifier;numerical analysis;online locator service;overhead (computing);router (computing);routing;scalability;server (computing);source lines of code	Moneeb Gohar;Seok Joo Koh	2013	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-013-1030-2	locator/identifier separation protocol;computer science;operating system;analysis;lisp;distributed computing;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	-14.232845306671452	77.76315923933544	80407

While the main focus of those solutions is management and provisioning of machines, real-time monitoring and communication control are also required to handle a variety of access technologies, like WiFi and LTE, and unleash machine deployment. In this paper, we present a new architecture addressing these issues by leveraging the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) deployed in operatorâs networks for RCS and VoLTE.	compaq lte;ip multimedia subsystem;machine to machine;provisioning;real-time clock;scalability;service layer;software deployment;software portability	Marc-Olivier Arsenault;Hanen Garcia Gamardo;Kim Khoa Nguyen;Mohamed Cheriet	2015	CoRR		embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;operating system;computer network	OS	-16.076179597333635	85.4478214046417	80518

VANET can be viewed as an intelligent component of the Transportation Systems as vehicles communicate with each other as well as with roadside base stations located at critical points of the road, such as intersections or construction sites. In this paper, we provide an overview of the context-aware processing and communication gateway associated with Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET). The concept of context-awareness, the recent advances and various challenges involved in context-aware processing are discussed. Some arising ideas such as based on context ontology, relevancy, hybrid dissemination, service oriented routing are also presented. This paper further briefly describes the communication gateway in VANET which includes its functional view together with the standards and their detailed preliminary specifications applicable to VANET.

These models treat the Internet as a black-box, ignoring its internal structure. While these models are simple, they can often fail systematically; for example, the most widely used models use metric embeddings that predict no benefit to detour routes even though half of all Internet routes can benefit from detours.In this paper, we adopt a structural approach that predicts path latency based on measurements of the Internet's routing topology, PoP connectivity, and routing policy. We find that our approach outperforms Vivaldi, the most widely used black-box model. Furthermore, unlike metric embeddings, our approach successfully predicts 65% of detour routes in the Internet. The number of measurements used in our approach is comparable with that required by black box techniques, but using traceroutes instead of pings.	black box;internet;ping (networking utility);routing	Harsha V.

This should happen without the need for pre-configuration or offline negotiation between network operators. Ambient Networks clearly separates the control space from the transport protocol, and introduces a common control space called the Ambient Control Space that comprised all control functionality within an Ambient Networks. The Ambient Control Space is also responsible for the composition of different networks, with the control spaces of composing networks forming one Ambient Control Space. This paper discusses the justification of Ambient Networks, the main novelties being introduced by Ambient Networks, and the requirements imposed on the Ambient Control Space. It also goes into a bit more details about the Ambient Networks architecture and draws initial conclusions.	ambient network;online and offline;requirement	Norbert Niebert	2005		10.1145/1080776.1080779	real-time computing;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-18.206260183570087	82.17460354334233	80862

The endpoints of a VPN are connected using abstractions such as Virtual Channels (VCs) of ATM or Label Switching Paths (LSPs) of MPLS technologies. Reliability of an end-to-end VPN connection depends on the reliability of the links and nodes in the fixed path that it traverses in the network. In order to ensure service quality and availability in a VPN, seamless recovery from failures is essential. This work considers the problem of fast recovery in the recently proposed VPN hose model. In the hose model bandwidth is reserved for traffic aggregates instead of pairwise specifications to allow any traffic pattern among the VPN endpoints. This work assumes that the VPN endpoints are connected using a tree structure and at any time, at most one tree link can fail (i.e., single link failure model). A restoration algorithm must select a set of backup edges and allocate necessary bandwidth on them in advance, so that the traffic disrupted by failure of a primary edge can be re-routed via backup paths. We aim at designing an optimal restoration algorithm to minimize the total bandwidth reserved on the backup edges. This problem is a variant of optimal graph augmentation problem which is NP-Complete. Thus, we present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that guarantees a solution which is at most 16 times of the optimum. The algorithm is based on designing two reductions to convert the original problem to one of adding minimum cost edges to the VPN tree so that the resulting graph is 2-connected, which can be solved in polynomial time using known algorithms. The two reductions introduce approximation factors of 8 and 2, respectively, thus resulting in a 16-approximation algorithm with polynomial time complexity.	atm turbo;approximation algorithm;backup;circuit restoration;end-to-end encryption;multiprotocol label switching;np-completeness;polynomial;provable prime;routing;seamless3d;time complexity;tree structure;virtual private network	Giuseppe F.

In this paper, we propose enhancing the capacity of an existing wireless mesh backhaul using free-space optical links. Such a hybrid RF/FSO network is capable of multiplying the available bandwidth for each subscriber if the FSO transceivers are placed at strategically located nodes. Adopting a TDMA- based framework, we formulate a problem for the optimal placement of FSO transceivers and RF link activation schedules which maximize the network capacity. An integer-linear program (ILP) is developed to obtain an optimal solution. Due to the complexity of this ILP, we also propose a relaxation which yields an upper bound on the network capacity in such an architecture, and develop a probabilistic heuristic that approaches this capacity. We show by simulations that our heuristic achieves a high fraction of the network capacity upper bound, and it can be implemented efficiently.	backhaul (telecommunications);computation;heuristic;last mile;linear programming relaxation;mesh networking;radio frequency;scheduling (computing);simulation;transceiver;wireless mesh network	Farshad Ahdi;Suresh Subramaniam	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134071	integer programming;logic gate;telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;computer network	Mobile	-5.0608415330288405	82.18971458138311	81145

This concept has potential to make network function provision and operation more flexible and costeffective, paramount in a world where deployed middleboxes may easily reach the order of hundreds. In spite of recent research activity in the field, little has been done towards efficient and scalable placement & chaining of virtual network functions (VNFs) â a key feature for the effective success of NFV. More specifically, existing strategies have either neglected the chaining aspect of NFV, focusing on efficient placement only, or failed to scale to hundreds of network functions. In this paper, we approach VNF placement and chaining as an optimization problem, and propose a fix-and-optimize-based heuristic algorithm for tackling it. Our algorithm incorporates a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) meta-heuristic, for efficiently exploring the placement and chaining solution space. The goal is to minimize required resource allocation, while meeting network flow requirements and constraints. We provide evidence that our algorithm is able to find feasible, high quality solutions efficiently, even in scenarios scaling to hundreds of VNFs.	algorithm;commodity computing;display resolution;feasible region;firewall (computing);flow network;heuristic (computer science);image scaling;mathematical optimization;middlebox;network function virtualization;optimization problem;proxy server;requirement;scalability;transfer function;variable neighborhood search	Marcelo Caggiani Luizelli;Weverton Luis da Costa Cordeiro;Luciana S.

1e3f974cf98e211bbb491f306b66b9008f439503	skipping congestion-links for coflow scheduling		Data transfer duration accounts for a great proportion of job completion time in big-data systems. To reduce the time spent on data transfer, some traffic scheduling mechanisms at coflow-level are proposed recently. Most of them abstract datacenter networks as an ideal non-blocking big-switch, and the bottleneck is located at egress or ingress ports of end-hosts instead of in networks. Thus, they mainly focus on how to allocate port capacities of end-hosts to jobs without considering in-network congestion. However, link congestion frequently occurs in datacenter networks due to network oversubscription and load imbalance. When link congestion occurs, bottleneck locations will move from the ports of end-hosts to network links. In this paper, we design and implement SkipL, a congestion-aware coflow scheduler which could detect congestion and schedules coflows at end-hosts to effectively reduce coflow completion time. In addition, to be easily deployed in cloud environments, SkipL does not require to control flow routes. SkipL prototype system is implemented in Linux. The results of experiments conducted in a real small testbed and simulations conducted in the flow-level simulator show that SkipL reduces the average Coflow Completion Time(CCT) compared to the per-flow fair sharing scheduling method and Varys.	big data;blocking (computing);computational complexity theory;control flow;data center;data system;egress filtering;experiment;fifo (computing and electronics);job stream;linux;microsoft customer care framework;network congestion;non-blocking algorithm;overselling;programmer;prototype;scheduling (computing);simulation;testbed;throughput	Shuo Wang;Jiao Zhang;Tao Huang;Tian Pan;Jiang Liu;Yunjie Liu;Jin Li;Feng Li	2017	2017 IEEE/ACM 25th International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS)	10.1109/IWQoS.2017.7969119	real-time computing;computer network;network topology;scheduling (computing);data transmission;computer science;cloud computing;port (computer networking);schedule;bottleneck;testbed	Networks	-13.348643274961592	79.71802893680795	81171

In this work, we consider a realistic scenario where available bandwidth for each link in a given network is time varying. In such a network and for a given file size, we provide an optimal algorithm that minimizes the total time required to transfer the file from source to destination. We further consider the problem where path shifting is allowed to increase the net throughput for bulk data transfer. For this problem, we provide a dynamic programming based optimal algorithm that minimizes the number of path shifts required to transfer the file in the specified time. Solution to the above problems addresses both the performance and scalability issues that arise in large bulk data transfer for long duration of time.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);dynamic programming;routing;scalability;throughput;time-varying network	Samrat Ganguly;Arunabha Sen;Guoliang Xue;Bin Hao;Bao Hong Shen	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Communications (IEEE Cat.

Although inter-domain provisioning has been well studied for packet/cell-switching networks, the wavelength dimension presents many additional challenges. To address this challenge, a detailed hierarchical routing GMPLS-based framework for provisioning all-optical and opto-electronic multi-domain DWDM networks is presented. The scheme adapts various topology abstraction schemes to improve routing scalability and lower inter-domain blocking probabilities. Related inter-domain lightpath RWA and signaling schemes are also tabled.

However, the rerouted traffic may cause congestion along the backup paths that would result in more packet losses than purely discarded the affected flows. In this paper, we take the concept of interface specific forwarding (ISF) to provide more flexibility in determining load balanced traffic rerouting. This problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, in which network survivability and traffic load distribution are jointly considered and the traffic load on the most congested link is to be minimized. Since this is an NP-hard problem, we further decompose it into several sub-problems which are solved optimally and their solutions are combined to provide an approximate solution to the ILP problem. The numerical results delineate that the proposed scheme achieves high survivability, load balancing and lesser bandwidth consumption at the expense of slightly raising the average path hop count.	approximation algorithm;backup;heuristic (computer science);hierarchical data format;ip address blocking;ink serialized format;integer programming;linear programming;load balancing (computing);mike lesser;np-hardness;network congestion;network packet;numerical analysis;routing table	Steven S.

c3e8e8db34494c5b27d3d92b35df5c3a29ec550f	a new method for providing network services: service function chain	path selection;virtulization;traffic streering;service deployment	Service deployment and management have been a challenge for the network operators because of the characteristics of traditional methods for service configuration and service deployment: unchangeable configuration and ossified deployment. Based on the ideas of Service Function Chain (SFC), Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), Software Defined Network (SDN), and Path Computation Element (PCE), we introduce a method that can not only maintain the services in a flexible and scalable way, but also place services in a topology-independent way and steer traffic among different services. We abstract the service path selection problem as a grey system theory problem and propose an algorithm to give a proper service composition selection and traffic steering method. We also validate the usability of the proposed solution in prototype and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in simulation environment.	service-oriented architecture	Taixin Li;Huachun Zhou;Hongbin Luo	2017	Optical Switching and Networking	10.1016/j.osn.2015.09.005	path computation element;computer network;service delivery framework;operator (computer programming);software deployment;scalability;service discovery;computer science;usability;distributed computing;software-defined networking	Networks	-14.51247991114415	83.53730843465354	81414

In an NFV infrastructure, it is required to dynamically extend/reduce resources granted to the virtual network function (VNF) as needed. In this paper, we explored SDN technology to construct lightweight virtual networks between Linux containers in dynamic container placement to isolate tenant traffic. We used an SDN controller to distribute logical endpoint information to physical switches before the host physical location was determined for the container. And we used physical switch functions to promptly configure virtual networks between containers when a container was dynamically placed on a host and started in a split second. We also actively probed the container and automatically removed the virtual network when the container stopped. By using our prototype, virtual networks were automatically constructed with no interaction with the SDN controller as soon as 500 of the containers were started.	communication endpoint;data center;lxc;linux;network function virtualization;network switch;northbound interface;open-source software;prototype;software deployment;software-defined networking;transfer function;x86 virtualization	Yukihiro Nakagawa;Chunghan Lee;Kazuki Hyoudou;Shinji Kobayashi;Osamu Shiraki;Jun Tanaka;Tomohiro Ishihara	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Network (NFV-SDN)	10.1109/NFV-SDN.2015.7387421	embedded system;computer science;virtual machine;operating system;computer network	Networks	-15.03321707351874	82.12737957677032	81434

The changes are made to the network in the form of upgrades such as software or hardware upgrades, new network or service features and network configuration changes. It is crucial to monitor the network when upgrades are made because they can have a significant impact on network performance and if not monitored may lead to unexpected consequences in operational networks. This can be achieved manually for a small number of devices, but does not scale to large networks with hundreds or thousands of routers and extremely large number of different upgrades made on a regular basis.  In this paper, we design and implement a novel infrastructure MERCURY for detecting the impact of network upgrades (or triggers) on performance. MERCURY extracts interesting triggers from a large number of network maintenance activities. It then identifies behavior changes in network performance caused by the triggers. It uses statistical rule mining and network configuration to identify commonality across the behavior changes. We systematically evaluate MERCURY using data collected at a large tier-1 ISP network. By comparing to operational practice, we show that MERCURY is able to capture the interesting triggers and behavior changes induced by the triggers. In some cases, MERCURY also discovers previously unknown network behaviors demonstrating the effectiveness in identifying network conditions flying under the radar.	aggregate data;computer hardware;database trigger;ibm notes;loudspeaker time alignment;mercury;network performance;operational semantics;radar;router (computing);rule 90;scalability;sensor;tier 1 network;unintended consequences	Ajay Mahimkar;Han Hee Song;Zihui Ge;Aman Shaikh;Jia Wang;Jennifer Yates;Yin Zhang;Joanne Emmons	2010		10.1145/1851182.1851219	simulation;computer science;data mining;behavior change;network simulation;network performance;computer security;change detection;data collection	Networks	-16.197183099273165	79.11163516407514	81530

In Software-Defined Networks (SDNs), different controller modules with diverse objectives may be installed on the SDN controller. Each module independently generates resource requests that may conflict with the objectives of a different module. For example, a controller module for maintaining high availability may want resource allocations that require too much core network bandwidth and thus conflict with another module that aims to minimize core bandwidth usage. In such a situation, it is imperative to identify and install resource allocations that achieve network wide global objectives that may not be known to individual modules, e.g., high availability with acceptable bandwidth usage. This problem has received only limited attention, with most prior work focused on detecting, avoiding, and resolving rule-level conflicts in the context of OpenFlow.  In this paper, we present an automatic resolution mechanism based on a family of voting procedures, and apply it to resolve resource conflicts among SDN and cloud controller programs. We observe that the choice of appropriate resolution mechanism depends on two properties of the deployed modules: their precision and parity. Based on these properties, a network operator can apply a range of resolution techniques. We present two such techniques.  Overall, our system promotes modularity and does not require each controller module to divulge its objectives or algorithms to other modules. We demonstrate the improvement in allocation quality over various alternative resolution methods, such as static priorities or equal weight, round-robin decisions. Finally, we provide a qualitative comparison of this work to recent methods based on utility or currency.	algorithm;cloud computing;high availability;imperative programming;openflow;parity bit;requirement;resolution (logic);round-robin dns;sensor;software-defined networking	Alvin AuYoung;Yadi Ma;Sujata Banerjee;Jeongkeun Lee;Puneet Sharma;Yoshio Turner;Chen Liang;Jeffrey C.

However, deploying this kind of routers may introduce severe accumulated packet delay, especially for high-end optical routers. In this paper, we present three contributions to solve the above issue with dynamically balancing QoS and the energy consumption, while preserve the real deployment simple and flexible. First, we propose a QoS aware power scaling algorithm for single self-motivated EER. Second, we present a QoS aware open-loop deployment method by using a short-term traffic forecast model. This model can assist EERs to adapt their capacities with the information of the incoming network traffic along the traffic path. Third, we propose a QoS aware feedback deployment method for better energy efficiency by building local control systems between two adjacent EER pairs. We evaluate the above algorithms by performing simulations. The results show that our methods are energy efficieny while controlling the packet delay.	algorithm;control system;enhanced entityârelationship model;image scaling;network packet;network traffic control;quality of service;router (computing);simulation;software deployment	Tian Song;Xiangjun Shi;Xiaowei Ma	2014	2014 ACM/IEEE Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS)	10.1145/2658260.2661774	real-time computing;quality of service;computer science;distributed computing;bandwidth;computer network	Networks	-10.440048110844488	82.39954088163582	81728

Today, operators engineer such capabilities through clever, but manual parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a back-end support tool for large-scale parameter configuration that is based on efficient parameter state space search techniques and on-line simulation. The framework is useful when the network protocol performance is sensitive to its parameter settings, and its performance can be reasonably modeled in simulation. In particular, our system imports the network topology, relevant protocol models and latest monitored traffic patterns into a simulation that runs on-line in a network operations center (NOC). Each simulation evaluates the network performance for a particular setting of protocol parameters. We propose an efficient large-dimensional parameter state space search technique called ldquorecursive random search (RRS).rdquo Each sample point chosen by RRS results in a single simulation. An important feature of this framework is its flexibility: it allows arbitrary choices in terms of the simulation engines used (e.g., ns-2, SSFnet), network protocols to be simulated (e.g., OSPF, BGP), and in the specification of the optimization objectives. We demonstrate the flexibility and relevance of this framework in three scenarios: joint tuning of the RED buffer management parameters at multiple bottlenecks, traffic engineering using OSPF link weight tuning, and outbound load-balancing of traffic at peering/transit points using BGP LOCAL_PREF parameter.	black box;border gateway protocol;communications protocol;computer simulation;experiment;line level;load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;network on a chip;network performance;network topology;online and offline;ordinary least squares;peering;random search;recursion (computer science);relevance;sampling (signal processing);search algorithm;state space search;web-based simulation	Tao Ye;Hema Tahilramani Kaur;Shivkumar Kalyanaraman;Murat Yuksel	2008	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1145/1453698.1453701	communications protocol;simulation;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer network;network traffic simulation	Networks	-13.013875435778319	79.27539982366173	81781
5e279bbe56439655351a7741ecee17176144c3ff	automatic mapping of cyber security requirements to support network slicing in software-defined networks		The process of digitalisation has an advanced impact on social lives, state affairs, and the industrial automation domain. Ubiquitous networks and the increased requirements in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) create the demand for future-proof network management. Therefore, new technological approaches, such as Software-Defined Networks (SDN) or the 5G Network Slicing concept, are considered. However, the important topic of cyber security has mainly been ignored in the past. Recently, this topic has gained a lot of attention due to frequently reported security related incidents, such as industrial espionage, or production system manipulations. Hence, this work proposes a concept for adding cyber security requirements to future network management paradigms. For this purpose, various security related standards and guidelines are available. However, these approaches are mainly static, require a high amount of manual efforts by experts, and need to be performed in a steady manner. Therefore, the proposed solution contains a dynamic, machine-readable, automatic, continuous, and future-proof approach to model and describe cyber security QoS requirements for the next generation network management.	automation;computer security;human-readable medium;next-generation network;production system (computer science);quality of service;requirement;software-defined networking	Marco Ehrlich;Lukasz Wisniewski;Henning Trsek;Daniel Mahrenholz;JÃ¼rgen Jasperneite	2017	2017 22nd IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)	10.1109/ETFA.2017.8247728	industrial espionage;quality of service;automation;engineering;network management;next-generation network;software-defined networking;slicing;computer security	EDA	-16.032700504090677	85.76704898783119	82170

OFDM has been recently proposed as a modulation technique for optical networks due to its good spectral efficiency enabling elastic bandwidth transmissions compared with Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM). So far, the vast majority of research papers on Routing and Spectrum Allocation (RSA) problem in optical OFDM focus on increasing spectrum efficiency, however power consumption rather than spectral efficiency may eventually become a barrier to the continued growth of the Internet. In this paper, we introduce RSA problem from the viewpoint of network power consumption, which we formulate as Low Power Consumption RSA (LPC-RSA) problem. Different algorithms to solve the LPC-RSA problem are present. We start by presenting an optimal integer linear programming (ILP) RSA algorithm using decomposition method which breaks RSA into its two substituent subproblems, namely, (i) routing and (ii) spectrum allocation and solves them sequentially. For large networks, a heuristic algorithm is also proposed. Our results indicate that RSA with optimal objective of power consumption can have better power consumption and the same spectral efficiency solution compared with RSA with optimal objective of spectral efficiency, and the proposed heuristic algorithm yields close to the optimal solution in low running time.	algorithm;frequency allocation;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;lpc;linear programming;modulation;rsa (cryptosystem);rsa problem;routing;spectral efficiency;time complexity;wavelength-division multiplexing	Siwei Qiang;Xuan Luo;Yaohui Jin	2011	2011 8th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing	10.1109/ICICS.2011.6173633	integer programming;telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;optical fiber;mathematics;computer network	EDA	-5.453065206752396	82.21127936472834	82273
4c7661d4cae3074bc0ed68700ed44f4d03b113ba	client-side routing-agnostic gateway selection for heterogeneous wireless mesh networks		Citizens develop Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) in many areas as an alternative or their only way for local interconnection and access to the Internet. This access is often achieved through the use of several shared web proxy gateways. These network infrastructures consist of heterogeneous technologies and combine diverse routing protocols. Network-aware state-of-art proxy selection schemes for WMNs do not work in this heterogeneous environment. We developed a client-side gateway selection mechanism that optimizes the client-gateway selection, agnostic to underlying infrastructure and protocols, requiring no modification of proxies nor the underlying network. The choice is sensitive to network congestion and proxy load, without requiring a minimum number of participating nodes. Extended Vivaldi network coordinates are used to estimate client-proxy network performance. The load of each proxy is estimated passively by collecting the Time-to-First-Byte of HTTP requests, and shared across clients. Our proposal was evaluated experimentally with clients and proxies deployed in guifi.net, the largest community wireless network in the world. Our selection mechanism avoids proxies with heavy load and slow internal network paths, with overhead linear to the number of clients and proxies.	apevia;client-side;elegant degradation;experiment;hypertext transfer protocol;interconnection;internet access;intranet;mesh networking;network congestion;network performance;overhead (computing);ping (networking utility);proxy server;quality of service;requirement;routing;streaming media;time to first byte;user experience;wireless mesh network	Emmanouil Dimogerontakis;JoÃ£o Neto;Roc Meseguer;Leandro Navarro-Moldes;LuÃ­s Veiga	2017	2017 IFIP/IEEE Symposium on Integrated Network and Service Management (IM)	10.23919/INM.2017.7987301	computer network;heterogeneous network;distributed computing;wireless network;computer science;municipal wireless network;mesh networking;wireless wan;routing protocol;wireless mesh network;order one network protocol	Networks	-12.672007826990066	82.53572970712017	82300

However, the difficulties of setting up such ad-hoc connections has thus far been a development barrier. There is currently a need for an abstraction tool to allow application developers to exploit the potential advantages of such networks with minimal knowledge of the underlying connectivity. We present Proxima, a framework for the Android platform, which employs ad-hoc device-to-device connections and proactive mesh routing for a decentralised topology with solely proximity-based rich content dissemination. The framework is designed to be developer- and user-friendly with minimal configuration effort, lightweight, reusable and hardware independent. After compilation, the size of its binary distribution is only 6MB. We have further developed a real-life application, named TuneSpy, based around sharing music with local peers. The development of TuneSpy has produced two positive outcomes. Firstly, it strongly demonstrates the ease of writing proximity-based applications with Proxima. Secondly, it has served as a testing platform for all framework functionality.	android;compiler;hoc (programming language);mesh networking;mobile app;peer-to-peer;real life;routing;usability	Justin Lewis Salmon;Rong Yang	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Services	10.1109/MobServ.2014.26	computer science;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer network	Mobile	-15.50801059504247	77.98845106421416	82318

In this paper, we address the problem of routing survivable multicast sessions (RSMS) in wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) mesh networks. We consider the dynamic network environment, where multicast sessions arrive dynamically one after another. Our objective is to be able to consume as least cost (e.g., wavelengths) as possible for one-at-a-time arrivals and no priori knowledge of future arrivals. We present an approximation algorithm that outperforms previously proposed algorithms for the RSMS problem such as optimal path-pair-based shared disjoint paths (OPPSDP). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approximation algorithm proposed for the RSMS problem. We prove that the cost of the solution obtained by the HCBA algorithm is at most 4 times that of the optimal solution. We show by simulation that our algorithm performs very close to the optimal solution obtained by solving a mathematical formulation for the RSMS problem. We also show that, compared with the OPPSDP algorithm, our algorithm can significantly reduce the average cost and the blocking probability.	approximation algorithm;blocking (computing);dijkstra's algorithm;erlang (unit);imperative programming;link-state routing protocol;mesh networking;multicast;order of approximation;provisioning;simulation;wavelength-division multiplexing	Hongbin Luo;Lemin Li	2007	2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks	10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317835	telecommunications;computer science;mesh networking;probability;distributed computing;approximation algorithm;wavelength-division multiplexing;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-4.795862649839744	82.39972848448	82471

The reason for proposing this type of control is that decision-making at each node leads to high performance of the whole network although each individual node handles its local traffic flow only on the basis of the information it is aware of from its immediately adjacent nodes. Our control method exhibits the desired stability and adaptability of network performance even when the network has an heterogeneous configuration and the capacity of links is dynamically changed. However, in order to make a comparison with other flow control methods under the same conditions, our evaluation used a closed network model, in which the number of packets was unchanged. This paper investigates the performance of our flow control method using an open network model, in order to show that our flow control method is still effective in more realistic networks. We identify the key issues associated with our flow control in an open network model, and demonstrate a solution.	autonomous robot;flow control (data);network model;network performance	Chisa Takano;Masaki Aida	2004	24th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops, 2004.

For building large-scale wireless mesh networks, multiple access networks are joined together into one large network. In such large networks, nodes have to communicate with the Internet via multiple access gateways. The problem in such scenarios is how to make mesh nodes aware of the gateway over which data is sent towards the Internet. The goal of this paper is to propose a routing protocol- independent method that allows nodes to (i) determine when they are switching the access network; (ii) to support switching of access networks; and (iii) to support multihoming.	access network;cost efficiency;institute for operations research and the management sciences;internet access;mesh networking;multihoming;prototype;relay;routing;simulation;testbed;wireless mesh network	Rainer Baumann;Olga Bondareva;Simon Heimlicher;Martin May	2007	21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (AINAW'07)	10.1109/AINAW.2007.44	wireless mesh network;switched mesh;channel access method;next-generation network;telecommunications;computer science;mesh networking;wireless network;shared mesh;distributed computing;order one network protocol;municipal wireless network;routing protocol;multihoming;ubiquitous computing;computer network	Mobile	-9.10059427886975	86.76972468707561	82856

This letter discusses the problem of reducing the label spaces in Multiprotocol Label Switched (MPLS) networks using label merging - better known as MultiPoint-to-Point (MP2P) connections. Because of its origins in IP, MP2P connections have been considered to have tree- shapes with Label Switched Paths (LSP) as branches. Due to this fact, previous works by many authors affirm that the problem of minimizing the label space using MP2P in MPLS - the Merging Problem - cannot be solved optimally with a polynomial algorithm (NP-complete), since it involves a hard- decision problem. However, in this letter, the Merging Problem is analyzed, from the perspective of MPLS, and it is deduced that tree-shapes in MP2P connections are irrelevant. By overriding this tree-shape consideration, it is possible to perform label merging in polynomial time. Based on how MPLS signaling works, this letter proposes an algorithm to compute the minimum number of labels using label merging: the Full Label Merging algorithm. As conclusion, we reclassify the Merging Problem as Polynomial-solvable, instead of NP-complete. In addition, simulation experiments confirm that without the tree-branch selection problem, more labels can be reduced.	computation;decision problem;experiment;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;multipoint ground;multiprotocol label switching;np-completeness;polynomial;relevance;selection algorithm;simulation;time complexity;virtual private network	Fernando Solano Donado;RamÃ³n Fabregat;JosÃ©-Luis Marzo	2008	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2008.050601	multiprotocol label switching;label distribution protocol;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;computer network	Theory	-5.664824303047549	83.30228099634665	82966

By fully using the flexibility that channel powers are adjustable at optical switches, we partition the network into stages where each stage is a link. We formulate a partitioned Nash game composed of link Nash games where each link Nash game is played towards minimizing channel OSNR degradation across the link. By breaking quasi-closed loops and selecting one link as the start, links/games can be placed sequentially in a ladder-nested form. The partition is simple and scalable and leads to a three-level hierarchical algorithm towards computation of Nash equilibria.	algorithm;authorization;computation;elegant degradation;game theory;ieee xplore;iterative method;mathematical optimization;nash equilibrium;network switch;optical switch;ring network;scalability;signal-to-noise ratio	Yan Pan;Lacra Pavel	2009	2009 International Conference on Game Theory for Networks	10.1109/GAMENETS.2009.5137444	control engineering;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing	Robotics	-5.1881177269502645	81.47419143997071	82995
22ecd24b514c6ec69988c1292e8ba67cfcd70b4d	cab: a reactive wildcard rule caching system for software-defined networks	wildcard rule caching;buckets;sdn	Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enables flexible flow control by caching policy rules at OpenFlow switches. Compared with exact-match rule caching, wildcard rule caching can better preserve the flow table space at switches. However, one of the challenges for wildcard rule caching is the dependency between rules, which is generated by caching wildcard rules overlapped in field space with different priorities. Failure to handle the rule dependency may lead to wrong matching decisions for newly arrived flows, or may introduce high storage overhead in flow table memory.  In this paper, we propose a wildcard rule caching system for SDN named CAching in Buckets (CAB). The main idea of CAB is to partition the field space into logical structures called buckets, and cache buckets along with all the associated rules. Through CAB, we resolve the rule dependency problem with small storage overhead. Compared to previous schemes, CAB reduces the flow setup requests by an order of magnitude, saves control bandwidth by a half, and significantly reduce average flow setup time.	cache (computing);flip-flop (electronics);network switch;openflow;overhead (computing);prototype;software-defined networking	Bo Yan;Yang Xu;Hongya Xing;Kang Xi;H.

The notable features of our flow-level simulator FSIM are its accuracy and fast simulation execution compared with conventional flow-level simulators. For improving simulation accuracy, our flow-level simulator FSIM utilizes accurate fluid-flow models. For accelerating simulation execution speed, our flow-level simulator FSIM adopts an adaptive numerical computation algorithm for ordinary differential equations. Another notable feature of our flow-level simulator FSIM is its compatibility with the existing network performance analysis tool. In this paper, through several experiments using our FSIM implementation, we evaluate the effectiveness of our flow-level simulator FSIM in terms of simulation speed, accuracy and memory consumption. Consequently, we show that our flow-level simulator FSIM outperforms a conventional flow-level simulator; i.e., it realizes approximately 100% faster simulation with higher accuracy and less memory consumption than a conventional flow-level simulator.	algorithm;communications protocol;computation;experiment;network performance;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;simulation	Yusuke Sakumoto;Ryouta Asai;Hiroyuki Ohsaki;Makoto Imase	2007	2007 15th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems	10.1109/MASCOTS.2007.17	computer simulation;acceleration;computational science;ordinary differential equation;the internet;simulation;information science;computer science;theoretical computer science;discrete event simulation;mathematical model;accuracy and precision;network performance;computational model;differential equation	Metrics	-9.399571467232857	76.31303305672718	83642

However, contrary to traditional mobile networks, 5G networks must consider many different application scenarios (Internet-of-Things, wearable devices, etc.). In this context it is defined the concept of network slicing, a technique where network resources are packaged and assigned in an isolated manner to set of users according to their specific requirements. The use of Virtual Network Functions and other similar technologies is a first step in this challenge, but deeper changes are required. Therefore, in this paper we present a virtualization-based technique for the design, management and implementation of future 5G systems with network slicing. The proposed technique employs extensively current virtualization technologies such as Docker or Kubernetes in order to create, coordinate and manage slices, services and functional components in future 5G networks. A simulation scenario describing these future mobile networks is also provided, in order to obtain first evidences of their predicted performance.

88fedbca782e3c6315a4a5310916c16dc5bfc6a9	multiple graph abstractions for parallel routing over virtual topologies		High throughput data transfers across the Internet has become a challenge with deployment of data centers and cloud platforms. In this paper, we propose to utilize the cores of a router to build multiple abstractions of the underlying topology to parallelize end-to-end (e2e) streams for bulk data transfers. By abstracting a different graph for each core, we steer each core to calculate a different e2e path in parallel. The e2e transfers can use the shortest paths obtained from each subgraph to increase the total throughput over the underlying network. Even though calculating shortest paths is well optimized in legacy routing protocols (e.g., OSPF), finding optimal set of subgraphs to generate non-overlapping and effective multiple paths is a challenging problem. To this end, we analyze centrality metrics to eliminate potentially highest loaded routers or edges in the topology without coordination and eliminate them from the subgraphs. We evaluate the heuristics in terms of aggregate throughput and robustness against failures.	aggregate data;central processing unit;centrality;cloud computing;computational complexity theory;data center;end-to-end encryption;genetic algorithm;heuristic (computer science);multi-core processor;multipath routing;np-completeness;network topology;router (computing);search algorithm;shortest path problem;software deployment;throughput	Ahmet Soran;Murat Yuksel;Mehmet Hadi Gunes	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2017.8116496	robustness (computer science);streams;throughput;open shortest path first;centrality;theoretical computer science;network topology;heuristics;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer science	HPC	-12.65083085399773	81.8536051544307	84055

However, it is often difficult to gather enough hardware resources for experimenting with a reasonably sized distributed application inside a controlled environment. Virtualization is thus a handy technique for creating such an experimentation testbed. We propose a tool called NEmu designed to create virtual dynamic networks by using emulation for testing and evaluating prototypes of networked or distributed applications with a complete control over the network topology and link parameters. NEmu leverages system emulators such as QEMU for virtualizing the hosts and the routers. It uses vnd for virtualizing components such as links and switches. In addition, NEmu allows users to create such customized topologies with limited hardware resources and without any administrative rights. We validate NEmu by replicating two network experiments and by showing that NEmu gives results very similar to the original	distributed computing;emulator;experiment;handy board;network switch;network topology;testbed	Vincent Autefage;Damien Magoni	2016	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2016.01.005	embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;operating system;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-15.842966845641822	81.02446305929202	84257
90ddafe52568c203bedb28cc03e0fe333e60b277	a scalable mobility-centric architecture for named data networking		Information-centric networking (ICN) proposes to redesign the Internet by replacing its host centric design wit h an information centric one, by establishing communication at the naming level, with the receiver side acting as the driving force beh ind content delivery. Such design promises great advantages for the del ivery of content to and from mobile hosts. This, however, is at the exp ense of increased networking overhead, specifically in the case o f Nameddata Networking (NDN) due to use of flooding for path recovery. In this paper, we propose a mobility centric solution to address the overhead and scalability problems in NDN by introducing a novel forwarding architecture that leverages decentralized serverassisted routing over flooding based strategies. We present an indepth study of the proposed architecture and provide demons trative results on its throughput and overhead performance at different levels of mobility proving its scalability and effectiveness, when compared to the current NDN based forwarding strategies.	digital distribution;exptime;icn gps;network packet;online locator service;overhead (computing);requirement;routing;scalability;server (computing);throughput	Aytac Azgin;Ravishankar Ravindran;Guoqiang Wang	2014	CoRR		telecommunications;operating system;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-14.53425833836372	77.74108503121067	84277

As we become more dependent on networks in our so-called cyber-world, network faults and downtime become very costly. Sometimes, a slight fault may cause critical disruptions or remediless damages to the network while the network manager is lost among a large amount of alarm messages. Therefore, the development of a practical and effective system for network fault diagnosis becomes an imperative and critical task. In this paper, we develop a hierarchical domain-oriented reasoning mechanism suitable for the delegated management architecture. It is based on the causality graph of a refined network fault propagation model as a result of our empirical study. An automated fault diagnosis system called Alarm Correlation View (or ACView) for isolating network faults in a multi-domain environment is proposed according to the hierarchical reasoning mechanism. This diagnosis system not only provides the process of automated alarm collection and correlation, but also serves the function of efficient fault localization and identification. Furthermore, an alarm-to-fault mapping strategy is used to enhance the fault reasoning capability for uncertain network fault propagation.	causality;data mining;downtime;fault detection and isolation;high-level programming language;imperative programming;network topology;network traffic control;prototype;software propagation	C.

A key scenario considered by the developers of this amendment is dense and overlapped networks typically present in residential buildings, offices, airports, stadiums, and other places of a modern city. Being crucial for Wi-Fi hotspots, the hidden station problem becomes even more challenging for dense and overlapped networks, where even access points (APs) can be hidden. In this case, user stations can experience continuous collisions of beacons sent by different APs, which can cause disassociation and break Internet access. In this paper, we show that beacon collisions are rather typical for residential networks and may lead to unexpected and irreproducible malfunction. We investigate how often beacon collisions occur, and describe a number of mechanisms which can be used to avoid beacon collisions in dense deployment. Specifically, we pay much attention to those mechanisms which are currently under consideration of the IEEE 802.11ax group.	collision problem;internet access;protection mechanism;reboot (computing);software deployment;vii;wireless access point;workaround	Dmitry Bankov;Evgeny M.

To deal with the problem, overlay proxy networks as well as distributed and composable services across these overlay networks are being deployed. This solution however, implies that the overlay networks must support not only data multicast for data delivery to a group of destinations, but also service multicast (incorporate services in the distribution tree) for semantic data transformations in order to deal with Internet heterogeneity. This paper presents challenges and solutions for building service multicast trees. We compare two groups of algorithms, the shortest-service-path-tree (SSPT) algorithm and the longest-match (LM) algorithm.

This work introduces a new cloud network federation framework for the automatic provision of Layer 2 (L2) and Layer 3 (L3) virtual networks to interconnect geographically distributed cloud infrastructures in a hybrid cloud scenario. This framework provides a simple, secure and elastic solution to create and manage federated networks across heterogeneous cloud providers, with abstraction of the underlying technologies. The paper also analyzes the main technologies and topologies that can used the framework to construct L2 and L3 overlay networks within hybrid clouds. In order to demonstrate the viability of the proposed solution and compare the different topologies, the article shows a proof-of-concept of a real federated network deployment in a hybrid cloud, which spans a local private cloud, managed with OpenNebula, and two public clouds, two different regions of Amazon EC2. Results show that L2 and L3 overlay connectivity can be achieved with a minimal bandwidth overhead, lower than 10%.	amazon elastic compute cloud (ec2);cloud computing;dependability;distributed computing;elasticity (data store);encapsulation (networking);fault tolerance;federation (information technology);feedback arc set;file spanning;firewall (computing);interconnection;layer 2 tunneling protocol;network function virtualization;network switch;overhead (computing);overlay network;provisioning;seamless3d;software deployment;software-defined networking;throughput;virtual lan	Rafael Moreno-Vozmediano;RubÃ©n S.

We design the virtual network topology (VNT) so as to achieve sufficiently large bandwidth and small delay with small energy consumption. To calculate the suitable VNT in a short period, we propose the topology called Generalized Flattened Butterfly and a method to set the parameters so as to suit the current condition. In our evaluation, we clarify that our method achieves the sufficient bandwidth and the target maximum number of hops between top-of rack(ToR) switches with small energy consumption.	bandwidth (signal processing);data center;network switch;network topology;numerical analysis;numerical method;requirement	Yuya Tarutani;Yuichi Ohsita;Masayuki Murata	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems (ICCS)	10.1109/ICCS.2012.6406106	embedded system;network traffic control;intelligent computer network;network architecture;computer science;network information system;network simulation;distributed computing;network delay;network topology;computer network;logical topology	HPC	-10.976395088389998	80.46995227477152	84469
1aec7c8efa17f30f25c3eef23dc8cdf52cd68df1	hsm: a hybrid streaming mechanism for delay-tolerant multimedia applications	satisfiability	Traditionally, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) deploy proxy servers at strategic locations at the edge of the network to efficiently serve client requests. With the tremendous growth in multimedia applications and the number of clients accessing such applications, an edge proxy server itself may serve clients connected to it through a multi-hop network of heterogeneous links. Further, a special class of multimedia applications that can tolerate start up delays is emerging. In such applications, clients require a minimum acceptable quality (loss-free transmission at a minimum encoded rate ri) and the start of play back at a specific time (t + di) where t is the current time and di is the delay tolerance acceptable to client i. Our work deals with enhancing performance of such networks through a Hybrid Streaming Mechanism (HSM). In HSM a clientâs request triggers the selection of an intermediate node as a streaming point to which multimedia contents are dynamically transferred from the proxy/source, and this streaming point streams the contents to the client. Transferred contents are temporarily cached at the streaming point to service future requests for the same content. HSM helps a Content Service Providerâs objective of satisfying as many client requests as possible and providing enhanced quality to clients given their delay tolerance. Simulation results demonstrate that by leveraging the delay tolerance of clients, and by combining the dynamic download and streaming mechanisms, HSM performs better than directly streaming from edge servers, serving on an average 40% more client requests.	cache (computing);centralized computing;download;hybrid kernel;internet backbone;proxy server;relay;server (computing);simulation;streaming algorithm;streaming media	Annanda Th.

fdb6fdeb68d9aded4327bc36e21742f75f6b5eac	measuring throughput of data center network topologies	network design;topology comparison;throughput	High throughput is a fundamental goal of network design. While myriad network topologies have been proposed to meet this goal, particularly in data center and HPC networking, a consistent and accurate method of evaluating a design's throughput performance and comparing it to past proposals is conspicuously absent. In this work, we develop a framework to benchmark the throughput of network topologies and apply this methodology to reveal insights about network structure. We show that despite being commonly used, cut-based metrics such as bisection bandwidth are the wrong metrics: they yield incorrect conclusions about the throughput performance of networks. We therefore measure flow-based throughput directly and show how to evaluate topologies with nearly-worst-case traffic matrices. We use the flow-based throughput metric to compare the throughput performance of a variety of computer networks. We have made our evaluation framework freely available to facilitate future work on design and evaluation of networks.	benchmark (computing);best, worst and average case;bisection bandwidth;data center;network planning and design;network topology;throughput	Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi;Ankit Singla;Brighten Godfrey;Alexandra Kolla	2014		10.1145/2591971.2592040	network planning and design;throughput;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-11.538201769763434	79.46978326085912	84592
775c054af160afd5d20056587dbcee222689723f	congestion-aware path selection for tor		Tor, an anonymity network formed by volunteer nodes, uses the estimated bandwidth of the nodes as a central feature of its path selection algorithm. The current load on nodes is not considered in this algorithm, however, and we observe that some nodes persist in being under-utilized or congested. This can degrade the networkâs performance, discourage Tor adoption, and consequently reduce the size of Torâs anonymity set. In an effort to reduce congestion and improve load balancing, we propose a congestion-aware path selection algorithm. Using latency as an indicator of congestion, clients use opportunistic and lightweight active measurements to evaluate the congestion state of nodes, and reject nodes that appear congested. Through experiments conducted on the live Tor network, we verify our hypothesis that clients can infer congestion using latency and show that congestion-aware path selection can improve performance.	enigma machine;experiment;jean;load balancing (computing);network congestion;proxy server;quality of service;selection algorithm;software propagation;tor messenger	Tao Wang;Kevin S.

0579a0cd8afa67b09ec51e33c475b3aefe4659df	experimental evaluation of multipath tcp schedulers	experimenting;scheduling;multipath tcp	Today many end hosts are equipped with multiple interfaces. These interfaces can be utilized simultaneously by multipath protocols to pool resources of the links in an efficient way while also providing resilience to eventual link failures. However how to schedule the data segments over multiple links is a challenging problem, and highly influences the performance of multipath protocols.  In this paper, we focus on different schedulers for Multipath TCP. We first design and implement a generic modular scheduler framework that enables testing of different schedulers for Multipath TCP. We then use this framework to do an in-depth analysis of different schedulers by running emulated and real-world experiments on a testbed. We consider bulk data transfer as well as application limited traffic and identify metrics to quantify the scheduler's performance. Our results shed light on how scheduling decisions can help to improve multipath transfer.	adaptive partition scheduler;emulator;experiment;multipath propagation;scheduling (computing);testbed	Christoph Paasch;Simone Ferlin Oliveira;ÃzgÃ¼ Alay;Olivier Bonaventure	2014		10.1145/2630088.2631977	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;scheduling;tcp acceleration;computer network	Mobile	-13.02719524373454	81.04317026944857	84713
7a4750b52af5063edc4184d348ef05197b18a4c4	softwarization of network coding functions and logical mapping to sdn		It is becoming clear that softwarization and virtualization of networking entail fundamental changes in how networking industry can control or troubleshoot traffic flows or enforce network-wide policies. Also application developers bystander major changes, with new opportunities for fast development of innovative applications and services. Network functions (NFs) are key building blocks to realise such potential. Indeed, NFs are currently subject of great development by diverse vendors for a large range of applications beyond traditional well known networking functionalities. Such new capabilities may benefit from flexible and scalable design as opposite to current blackbox view of NFs. In this paper we propose one such novel NF with flexible and scalable design. Our NF exploits the capabilities of the network coding (NC) concept to improve different metrics of service performance, hence resulting in a NC service that can be offered either to external customers or used as internal service by the network provider. Our main contribution is three-fold. First, we justify our approach of internal logical visibility of network coding functions (NCFs), which allows proprietary while interoperable NCFs. Second, we propose the modelling of NCFs internal logic in terms of their software functional architecture. Finally, we show that our functional logic naturally maps to softwarized network architectures, which in turn facilitates NCFs virtualization. We also discuss the applicability of our architectures to representative conceptual scenarios and identify next steps.	interoperability;linear network coding;new foundations;scalability;software-defined networking	M.

Compared to traffic engineering for multiple unicast flows, multicast traffic engineering for multiple trees is very challenging not only because minimizing the bandwidth consumption of a single multicast tree by solving the Steiner tree problem is already NP-Hard, but the Steiner tree problem does not consider the link capacity constraint for multicast flows and node capacity constraint to store the forwarding entries in Group Table of OpenFlow. In this paper, therefore, we first study the hardness results of scalable multicast traffic engineering in SDN. We prove that scalable multicast traffic engineering with only the node capacity constraint is NP-Hard and not approximable within Î´, which is the number of destinations in the largest multicast group. We then prove that scalable multicast traffic engineering with both the node and link capacity constraints is NP-Hard and not approximable within any ratio. To solve the problem, we design a Î´-approximation algorithm, named Multi-Tree Routing and State Assignment Algorithm (MTRSA), for the first case and extend it to the general multicast traffic engineering problem. The simulation and implementation results demonstrate that the solutions obtained by the proposed algorithm outperform the shortest-path trees and Steiner trees. Most importantly, MTRSA is computation-efficient and can be deployed in SDN since it can generate the solution with numerous trees in a short time.	approximation algorithm;computation;dijkstra's algorithm;multicast;np-hardness;openflow;routing;scalability;shortest path problem;simulation;software-defined networking;steiner tree problem;time complexity;unicast	Liang-Hao Huang;Hsiang-Chun Hsu;Shan-Hsiang Shen;De-Nian Yang;Wen-Tsuen Chen	2016	IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524383	traffic engineering;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;theoretical computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;software-defined networking;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;multicast address	DB	-5.63683456535449	82.34658216621624	85016

The challenge for topology exposure is to provide a compact representation that is sufficiently accurate and complies to topology hiding policies. This paper presents a topology abstraction system that can expose large-scale service provider network maps with an adjustable level-of-detail. Our system uses graph sparsification algorithms to reduce the complexity of routing topologies. Our numerical results reveal that the size of maps can be reduced by one order of magnitude or more while the result still enables reasonable traffic optimization inside applications.

Such communication patterns are intensively used in the so-called grid computing infrastructure where many computing resources are spread over the Internet to offer to the users the access to a huge amount of computational power. However, meeting the objectives of reliable multicast is not an easy task and this paper presents active solutions that aim to reduce the end-to-end latency and to increase the achievable throughput of reliable multicast protocols for grid computing over the Internet. More specifically, the performances of several active mechanisms such as NACK aggregation and subcasting are investigated.	acknowledgement (data networks);end-to-end principle;grid computing;internet;multicast;performance;throughput	Moufida Maimour;CongDuc Pham	2001			parallel computing;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;grid computing;computer network;multicast address	HPC	-8.792331638018213	87.17358116868634	85081

OPS can deliver lower latency and higher bandwidth than traditional electrical switches. These features are needed for parallel High Performance Computing (HPC) applications. For this purpose, it has been recently designed full optical network architectures for HPC system such as the Architecture-On-Demand (AoD) network infrastructure. Although light-based transmission has its advantage over electrical-based transmissions, optical devices such as OPS cannot store light. Therefore, in case of an optical packet collision occurs for accessing the same output port in OPS only one packet can proceed and the others must be dropped, triggering afterwards a retransmission procedure. Obviously, packet retransmissions are delaying the actual transmission and also increase the buffer utilization at the network interfaces cards (NICs) that deals with retransmissions. In this paper, it is proposed a technique based on mapping application processes to servers reducing the number of simultaneous packets in the network (Concurrency) and therefore, it is able to significantly reduce optical collisions at the OPS while substantially reduces the resource needed at the NICs for retransmissions. Our proposed concurrency-aware mapping technique can reduce the extra buffer size utilization up to 4.2 times and the execution time degradation up to 2.6 times.	network packet;packet switching	Hugo Meyer;JosÃ© Carlos Sancho;Milica Mrdakovic;Wang Miao;Nicola Calabretta	2018	Future Generation Comp.

Achieving this by using only end-to-end measurements at the application level is a method known as network tomography. When the topology produced reflects capacities of sets of links with respect to a metric, the topology is called a Metric-Induced Network Topology (MINT). Tomography producing MINT has been widely used in order to predict performances of communications between clients and server. Nowadays grids connect up to thousands communicating resources that may interact in a partially or totally coordinated way. Consequently, applications running upon this kind of platform often involve massively concurrent bulk data transfers. This implies that the client/server model is no longer valid. In this paper, we introduce new algorithms that reconstruct a novel representation of the knowledge inferred from the network which is able to deal with multiple sources/multiple destinations transfers.	algorithm;clientâserver model;distributed computing;end-to-end principle;interaction;many-to-many;mathematical optimization;network topology;performance;programming paradigm;prototype;server (computing);the offspring;tomography	Laurent Bobelin;Traian Muntean	2008	2008 International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing	10.1109/ISPDC.2008.56	routing;network tomography;computer science;distributed computing;software testing;tomography;memory;grid;world wide web;network topology;bandwidth;clientâserver model;grid computing;server;computer network;logical topology	Metrics	-12.456592937745292	77.05903894495249	85459

93fbf8e5f85ed6e2fa6bf8cb2d44d2d07b54a8f9	foreword - automatic communication towards new paradigms for network adaptation and control		We see the goal of this special issue devoted to the area of Autonomic Communication (AC) in providing a snapshot of current understanding of the field, enhanced by some deep insights into various problem areas. We deliberately do not provide our own definition of the AC, as this already has been done in an excellent way by our authors. However we use the opportunity of this text to express our opinion on the greatest innovation AC brings to networking: evolution. The global information infrastructure evolves concurrently in many dimensions and increases the diversity of protocol stacks in use. Automation, adaptation and reconfigurability contribute to seamless service provisioning, but cannot properly address the requirement of self-adaptation based on network context [1] within a highly heterogeneous networking environment. Other relevant approaches such as Plutarch, a network pluralism architecture [2] that embraces heterogeneity with the aim of allowing radical innovation, and of course also the current Internet architecture as specified by IETF are not abandoned but retained as specific architectures among many. In the Plutarch architecture the world is divided into homogeneous contexts understood as sets of bindings. Endpoints may belong to different contexts simultaneously and dynamically. In order to maintain ubiquitous connectivity, protocol stack organisation (allowing flexible binding, reconfiguration, adaptation, functional composition, etc.) is critical. The vision of autonomic communication comprises protocol stack instances being dynamically composed on-demand and shaped by available network contexts. This does not mean that all interfacing functions are to be limited to endpoints only; we see control within autonomic communication being instantiated as a tree rooted at an endpoint and having as much in-network support as current contexts are able to provide. Selfmanagement then is the result of autonomic decision making in collaboration with other endpoints and network infrastructure when available. With the continuously evolving complexity in communication networks, it appears to be desirable to design protocol stacks that have the ability to learn and to evolve in order to satisfy newly identified needs. The papers accepted for publication in this special issue represent the wide set of issues addressed today by techniques which belong to the Autonomic Communication paradigm. Talking of challenges of today we decided to start with the issue of Quality of Service (QoS) in wireless networks.

These rings currently employ architectures and protocols that are neither optimized for nor scalable to the network demand. Therefore, emerging technologies are being pushed to replace the traditional architectures. Among these technologies, optical burst switching (OBS) is an effective and promising technology. In this study, a novel architecture, dual-fiber OBS (DOBS), is proposed. This architecture has similar functions to those of fiber delay lines, partial wavelength conversion and deflection routing. A theoretical model is developed to evaluate the performance of DOBS, which is compared with single-fiber and simple two-fiber schemes by introducing them into ring and mesh MAN in simulations. The results reveal that DOBS can exponentially reduce the burst dropping probability. Moreover, since DOBS can be implement using commercially available devices and dark fibers, it is commercially viable in metro networks.	algorithm;amplifier;bandwidth-delay product;burst error;computer architecture;computer simulation;ibm notes;network switch;numerical analysis;optical burst switching;optical fiber;optical switch;passive optical network;routing;scalability;scheduling (computing);token ring;wavelength-division multiplexing;write combining	Zhenrong Zhang;Chi Yuan;Zhengbin Li;Anshi Xu	2011	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-011-0366-3	telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Arch	-7.421287145795193	86.95252576707192	85978

With the introduction of the path computation element, routes can be calculated more efficiently in multi-domain optical networks. However, the optimal degree of routing approach in multi-layer and multi-domain optical networks is also determined by the clustering algorithms deployed for construction of hierarchical networks. Therefore, it is important to investigate the way to evaluate the impact of the clustering algorithm on the routing approach (e.g., blocking probability) in optical networks with dynamic traffic, which has not been studied sufficiently. In this paper, a novel method to describe and evaluate the clustered structures generated by different clustering algorithms for hierarchical optical networks is proposed. This method deploys a novel evaluation metric that represents blocking probability of clustered optical networks, so it can be used as guidelines for designing clustered structures. Besides theoretical analysis, simulations are carried out on different network topologies and clustered types to validate the effectiveness of the method presented.	algorithm;blocking (computing);cluster analysis;computation;emoticon;erlang (unit);layer (electronics);network topology;requirement;routing;routing table;simulation;tree network	Shanguo Huang;Weihua Lian;Xian Zhang;Bingli Guo;Pei Luo;Jie Zhang;Wanyi Gu	2011	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-011-0349-4	routing;shared risk resource group;hierarchical routing;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;hierarchical network model;distributed computing;cluster analysis;wavelength-division multiplexing;hierarchical clustering of networks	AI	-6.223323678306631	83.82132700565455	86070

Network data caching is a characteristic of CCN whose effectiveness depends on the content caching policies in the nodes. Leave copy everywhere (LCE) is the default policy in CCN which caches all content at all nodes leading to poor caching performance. Several policies have been proposed to improve the caching performance in CCN. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of caching policies in terms of caching hit ratio, time delay, and distance from consumer to caching hit content in the first node. In addition, we compare the caching policies combined with the content replacement policies when caching space at nodes is not enough room to cache new content.

Due to the statistical multiplexing approach adopted, these paradigms must deal with packet/burst contentions at the node output channels and require the use of scheduling algorithms to optimize resource assignment and bandwidth utilization. However, very strict time constraints on the scheduling operations are imposed by the extremely high bit rates used, making the actual feasibility of the scheduler control logic a major implementation issue common to both technologies. This paper provides a specific formulation of the scheduling problem that can be used as the basis for the practical design of a fast and versatile scheduler, capable of implementing many algorithms found in literature. A possible implementation of the scheduler sub-functions, mainly based on the use of combinatorial operations, is also discussed and supported by the simulation of the hardware implementation time response, with results that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution.

b7db588a8ada195c2b0f850e4f370df6eb5372cc	identifying good connections in an unstructured peer-to-peer network: the case of gnutella		Past studies have shown the unstability of unstructured peer-to-peer networks and in particular Gnutella. Because of this unstability, queries in these networks are inefficient. Furthermore, to keep the network stable, the protocols used require huge bandwidth usage. One approach proposed by Gnutella conceptors is to create two classes of servents: leaf nodes and ultrapeers. The core of the network is preserved by the ultrapeers, while the leaf nodes remain at the periphery. Others suggest to use random walks rather than flooding. We also see suggestions to build communities to reduce traffic. In this paper, we investigate the possibility to use a different, yet complementary approach, where a node would only keep connections that it deems âgoodâ. Based on statistics collected on the Gnutella network, we show that it is possible to rapidly determine whether a connection is good or not. The detection of good connections uses two criteria: the duration of connection establishment time and the number of messages received through the connection.	gnutella;peer-to-peer;tree (data structure)	Gilbert Babin;Denis Larocque;Abdessamad Dine	2011			world wide web;peer-to-peer;internet privacy;computer science	Metrics	-10.6066041922745	77.77336214923415	86419

These problems are often posed as under-determined linear inverse (UDLI) problems and solved in a centralized manner, where all the measurements are collected at a central node, which then applies a variety of inference techniques to estimate the attributes of interest. This paper proposes a novel framework for decentralizing these large-scale under-determined network inference problems by intelligently partitioning it into smaller subproblems and solving them independently and in parallel. The resulting estimates, referred to as multiple descriptions, can then be fused together to compute the global estimate. We apply this Multiple Description and Fusion Estimation (MDFE) framework to three classical problems: traffic matrix estimation, traffic matrix completion, and loss inference. Using real topologies and traces, we demonstrate how MDFE can speed up computation while maintaining (even improving) the estimation accuracy and how it enhances robustness against noise and failures. We also show that our MDFE framework is compatible with a variety of existing inference techniques used to solve the UDLI problems.	central processing unit;centralized computing;computation;sparse matrix;tomography;tracing (software)	Mehdi Malboubi;Cuong Vu;Chen-Nee Chuah;Puneet Sharma	2013	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6566967	the internet;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;theoretical computer science;machine learning;data mining;mathematics;statistics	Metrics	-7.982814202060464	79.59045981745822	86813

Scalability of the control plane with respect to network size and update frequency is an important problem that has been addressed by previous studies from a variety of viewpoints. However, the solutions found in these studies may be only locally optimized solutions. To find a globally optimized solution, a broader viewpoint is required: one in which various SDN architectures can be evaluated and compared. In this paper, we propose an abstract model of SDN architectures, which enables multiple SDN architectures to be compared under a unified evaluation condition, and discuss the modeling of SDN architecture and its variations to find the optimal design from a global viewpoint. We first propose a generic model of SDN architectures and derive variations in terms of composition unit (single or multiple), processing principle (sequential or parallel), or location (intra- or inter-node). We then show that existing SDN architectures can be represented as one of the variations of our abstract model with fitted parameters. Finally we discuss how variation of components affects performance and show, using message-driven simulations, that our model enables comprehensive performance comparisons of different SDN designs represented as parameterized models.	control plane;forwarding plane;network architecture;optimal design;performance evaluation;scalability;simulation;software-defined networking	Tatsuya Sato;Shingo Ata;Ikuo Oka;Yasuhiro Sato	2015	2015 11th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM)	10.1109/CNSM.2015.7367345	data modeling;real-time computing;scalability;information processing;computer science;theoretical computer science;process control;mathematical model;distributed computing;software-defined networking;multiplexing;computer network	HPC	-9.816681512357542	83.07718438399705	86833

Network paradigms such as Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) architectures are one paradigm for providing high bandwidth scalable data communication. WMNs are formed by self-organized wireless nodes that use multi-hop wireless relaying for data communications. In this paper describe our experience using mesh network architecture broadband network developed for homeland security and medical emergency applications. We briefly discuss the architecture and present the traffic behavioral observations made by a client server applications tested during a large scale homeland security drill.

Most of the strengths and weaknesses of these two types of testbeds are complementary. We outline the motivation, design, implementation, and sample results of an environment that seeks to provides the best of each type. Flexlab couples an emulation testbed with arbitrary network models. We also present a novel modeling technique tuned for this environment, application-centric Internet modeling. The key idea is to monitor the applicationâs offered network load within the emulation testbed, replicate that load on the overlay testbed, measure the pathâs characteristics through analysis of the traffic, and use those to shape the emulated network.	emulator;self-replicating machine;testbed	Jonathon Duerig;Robert Ricci;Junxing Zhang;Daniel Gebhardt;Sneha Kumar Kasera;Jay Lepreau	2006			network model;replicate;the internet;friendly environment;computer architecture;testbed;emulation;overlay;strengths and weaknesses;computer science	Networks	-13.541382432630932	79.09067672040119	86944

The OFDM technology, on one hand, enables both sub-wavelength and super-wavelength traffic accommodation by allocating appropriate number of sub-carriers. On the other hand, it can provide high signal quality by overcoming various impairments. In SLICE networks, one fundamental problem is to establish spectrum paths by allocating sub-carriers along the corresponding route to accommodate traffic demands. This is referred to as the routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) problem. The optimal RSA problem is NP-Hard and different from the traditional routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem in WDM networks. In this work, we formulate the RSA problem using the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations to achieve different optimization objectives. We then analyze the lower/upper bounds for the sub-carrier number in a SLICE network. We also propose two efficient heuristic algorithms to minimize the required sub-carrier number in a large SLICE network when the ILP model becomes intractable. The results show that the proposed algorithms can match the analysis and approximate the optimal solutions from the ILP model.	approximation algorithm;frequency allocation;heuristic;ibm notes;linear programming;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;online and offline;rsa problem;routing and wavelength assignment;simulation;subcarrier;wavelength-division multiplexing	Yang Wang;Xiaojun Cao;Qian Hu	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5963223	mathematical optimization;integer programming;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;theoretical computer science;mathematics;computer network	EDA	-5.587170489048107	82.4585431632978	86947

However, current routing system can not exploit the Internet path diversity and utilize the disjoint end-to-end paths efficiently. The unawareness of sources to the path selection and the best paths advertisement mechanism in the interdomain routing make it difficult to use disjoint end-to-end paths. In this paper, we present the Source-Directed Path Diversity (SDPD), leveraging which sources can specify the alternate paths to forward the traffic besides the default path. In SDPD, the packets carry the Source-Directed Tag (SDT) in the packet headers to hint the BGP routers the preference of the sources on the path selection, while the BGP routers forward the packets independently based on the sources' indication. Moreover, we propose the multipath advertisement of the BGP route reflectors in SDPD to reduce the filtration of the redundant paths in the interdomain routing. We evaluate the SDPD through simulations over a synthetic Internet-like topology. The simulation results show that the SDPD can exploit alternate paths with low similarity and stretch efficiently	inter-domain;routing	Xue Miao;Gang Fu;Ruitao Ma;Longshe Huo	2014	JNW	10.4304/jnw.9.12.3251-3262	real-time computing;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;multipath routing;distributed computing;computer network	ECom	-7.739004486023261	86.0338811299387	86974
62cd215a91dabd80e8ae30ce24356dcea8542933	reducing energy consumption of network infrastructure using spectral approach		The energy consumption by ICT (Information and Communication Technology) equipment is rapidly increasing which causes a significant economic and environmental problem. At present, the network infrastructure is becoming a large portion of the energy footprint in ICT. Thus, the concept of energy efficient or green networking has been introduced. Now one of the main concerns of network industry is to minimize energy consumption of network infrastructure because of the potential economic benefits, ethical responsibility, and its environmental impact. In this paper, the energy management strategies to reduce the energy consumed by network switches in LAN (Local Area Network) have been developed. According to the lifecycle assessment of network switches, the highest amount of energy is consumed during usage phase. The study considers bandwidth, link load and traffic matrices as input parameters which have the highest contribution to energy footprints of network switches during usage phase and energy consumption as output. Then with the objective of reducing energy usage of network infrastructure, the feasibility of putting Ethernet switches hibernate or sleep mode was investigated. After that, the network topology was reorganized using clustering method based on the spectral approach for putting network switches to hibernate or switched off mode considering the time and communications among them. Experimental results show the interest in this approach in terms of energy consumption.	algorithm;cluster analysis;experiment;internet;network architecture;network planning and design;network switch;network topology;parallel computing;power management;router (computing);sleep mode;spectral clustering;ubiquitous computing;yang	Mohammad Habibullah Khan;Eric Rondeau;Jean-Philippe Georges	2016	CoRR		network traffic control;simulation;telecommunications;network information system;energy accounting;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-18.4514955225389	78.91176256551309	87160

The wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technology has been popular in communication societies for providing very large communication bands by multiple lightpaths with different wavelengths on a single optical fiber. Particularly, a double-ring optical network architecture based on the packet-over-WDM technology such as the HORNET architecture has been studied as a next generation platform for metropolitan area networks (MANs). Each node in this architecture is equipped with a wavelength-fixed optical-drop and a tunable transmitter so that a lightpath can be established between any pair of nodes without wavelength conversions. In this paper, we formulate ODWAP for efficient wavelength reuse under heterogeneous traffic in this network. Then, we propose a simple heuristic algorithm for ODWAP. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing waiting times for packet transmissions when a small number of wavelengths are available to retain the network cost for MANs.	algorithm;assignment problem;blocking (computing);erlang (unit);futures studies;heuristic (computer science);np-completeness;network architecture;network packet;optical fiber;ring network;simulation;transmitter;wavelength-division multiplexing	Nobuo Funabiki;Megumi Isogai;Toru Nakanishi;Teruo Higashino	2005	19th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA'05) Volume 1 (AINA papers)	10.1109/AINA.2005.267	heuristic;ring network;metropolitan area network;telecommunications;computer science;optical fiber;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network	HPC	-5.376209914076971	81.53830141088643	87304

Vehicular nodes have very unpredictable mobility patterns, especially in cities, and use a specific communication protocol; therefore, the commonly used solutions for large scale testbeds are not directly applicable. This is the case of our vehicular network testbed developed in the framework of the DRIVE-IN and Future Cities! (DRIVE-IN and Future Cities!)1 projects. This paper tackles the aforementioned issues by proposing the design and implementation of a testbed management system based on the cOntrol and Management Framework (OMF). The base functionalities of OMF were extended to integrate node control over cellular networks, as well as to guarantee that experiments are always safely deployed, minimizing the risk of node corruption and malfunctioning. The management platform is capable of uploading new software to the vehicular nodes, conduct experiments using the specific vehicular wireless (IEEE 802.11p) interface, collect the resulting data, as well as storing and managing information about all the nodes. The results obtained from real-world experiments show that the the proposed platform is able to manage a Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET) testbed.	communications protocol;control theory;experiment;hoc (programming language);international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;oml;oracle database;requirement;scart;server (computing);software deployment;testbed;upload;virtual tape library;watchdog timer;web typography	JoÃ£o Afonso;AndrÃ© Cardote;Susana Sargento	2014	2014 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2014.6912593	vehicular ad hoc network;telecommunications;vehicular communication systems;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-17.570068384705042	85.74883735025341	87531

It has shown great advantages in simplifying network management such that new functions can be easily supported without physical access to the network switches. However, Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM), as a critical hardware storing rules for high-speed packet processing in SDN-enabled devices, can be supplied to each device with very limited quantity because it is expensive and energy-consuming. To efficiently use TCAM resources, we propose a rule multiplexing scheme, in which the same set of rules deployed on each node apply to the whole flow of a session going through but towards different paths. Based on this scheme, we study the rule placement problem with the objective of minimizing rule space occupation for multiple unicast sessions under QoS constraints. We formulate the optimization problem jointly considering routing engineering and rule placement under both existing and our rule multiplexing schemes. Via an extensive review of the state-of-the-art work, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the non-routing-rule placement problem. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to show that our proposals significantly outperform existing solutions.	approximation algorithm;computational complexity theory;content-addressable memory;control plane;forwarding plane;heuristic (computer science);linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;np-hardness;network packet;network switch;optimization problem;physical access;programming paradigm;provisioning;quality of service;rounding;routing;rule 184;simulation;software-defined networking;telecommunications access method;unicast	Huawei Huang;Song Guo;Peng Li;Baoliu Ye;Ivan Stojmenovic	2015	IEEE Transactions on Computers	10.1109/TC.2015.2401031	embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;software-defined networking;computer network	DB	-5.7790373756248	83.03291607530716	87534

A mathematical programming model of the network design problem is presented that assumes that the packet rates of elastic traffic flows decrease fairly. While practically any subset of network links can be simultaneously affected by unfavourable transmission conditions, a particular challenge of solving the problem results from a huge number of network states considered in the model. Therefore, how the problem can be solved by generating the most unfavourable network states is presented.Moreover, it is proved that it is entirely sufficient to consider only the states that correspond to the decrease of capacity on a single link. Finally, as the general problem is nonlinear, it is shown that the problem can be transformed to a linear MIP problem and solved effectively when single-path routing of traffic flows is assumed.

It is desirable to improve network efficiency by adaptively assigning resources to services that have different bandwidth demands. Implementing Broadband Integrated Services Digital Networks (B-ISDN) therefore requires a network control scheme that can handle bursty traffic with unexpected fluctuations. The Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology provides this flexibility by virtualizing network resources through the use of the virtual path (VP) concept. In this study, a method for designing a VP-based ATM network is proposed. The developed heuristic design algorithm applies VP routing and separation techniques to minimize the maximum link utilization under processing delay constraints. Each link is assigned a weight that reflects its current utilization. Using these weights, the VPs on highly utilized links are rerouted to less congested physical paths. The algorithm makes use of the equivalent bandwidth concept, which provides an efficient method to estimate capacity requirements of connection requests such that QoS requirements are met. The quality of the solutions achieved by the proposed method is compared to several competitors under varying network topologies and traffic conditions. The observations on the algorithm performance show that the developed method is able to facilitate an efficient use of network resources through the introduction of VPs.	atm turbo;algorithm;approximation;backup;blocking (computing);coexist (image);common access card;comparison of command shells;control function (econometrics);digital cross connect system;display resolution;embedded system;entity;erlang (unit);heuristic;integrated services digital network;internet backbone;link-state routing protocol;multipoint ground;network congestion;network interface;network switch;network topology;point-to-point protocol;point-to-multipoint communication;point-to-point (telecommunications);private network;processing delay;quality of service;real life;real-time computing;reliability engineering;requirement;routing;time complexity	Kaan BÃ¼r;Cem Ersoy	2000	Computer Communications	10.1016/S0140-3664(99)00160-7	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;asynchronous transfer mode;distributed computing;virtual circuit;network topology;computer network	Networks	-7.451880961676837	84.2257964499582	88373

In order to provide a guaranteed quality of the overlay functions, even under strong dynamics in the network with regard to peer capacities, online participation and usage patterns, we propose to calibrate the peer-to-peer overlay and to autonomously learn which qualities can be reached. For that, we simulate the peer-to-peer overlay systematically under a wide range of parameter configurations and use neural networks to learn the effects of the configurations on the quality metrics. Thus, by choosing a specific quality setting by the overlay operator, the network can tune itself to the learned parameter configurations that lead to the desired quality. Evaluation shows that the presented self-calibration succeeds in learning the configuration-quality interdependencies and that peer-to-peer systems can learn and adapt their behavior according to desired quality goals.	advanced configuration and power interface;artificial neural network;autonomic computing;backpropagation;best-effort delivery;distributed control system;feedforward neural network;interdependence;overlay network;peer-to-peer;routing;rprop;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation	Timo Klerx;Kalman Graffi	2013	IEEE P2P 2013 Proceedings	10.1109/P2P.2013.6688720	calibration;computer science;machine learning;data mining;database;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security;artificial neural network;computer network	Metrics	-13.872941480467974	78.40775818423751	88849
7ceb28c3f60fa9a62749189ba4e66932d6610a4e	efficient support for content-based routing in web server clusters	content based routing	Clustered server architectures have been employed for many years on the Internet as a way to increase performance, reliability and scalability in the presence of the Internet's explosive growth. A routing mechanism for mapping requests to individual servers within cluster is at the heart of any server clustering techniques. In this paper, we first analyze the deficiencies of existing request-routing approaches. Based on these observations, we argue that the request routing mechanism in a cluster-based server should factor in the content of a request in making decisions. Thus, we designed and implemented a new mechanism to efficiently support content-aware routing in Web server clusters. With this mechanism, we also built in a number of sophisticated content-aware intelligence for making routing decision. Performance evaluation on a prototype implementation demonstrates substantial performance improvements over contemporary routing schemes. The proposed mechanism can also enable many new capabilities in cluster-based servers, such as sophisticated load balancing, differentiated service, special content deployment, session integrity, etc.	routing;server (computing);web server	Chu-Sing Yang;Mon-Yen Luo	1999			policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;world wide web;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network;server farm	OS	-14.24458650484466	75.78148429094516	88861

Although in the last decade several algorithms were proposed and studied, none of them were analyzed from an important point of view: are they really dynamic? In our paper we introduce some metrics that help to observe the changes of the resource usage in a network with dynamic grooming. Several previously introduced algorithm were taken under the scope and our simulation results show, that they work in really dynamic way only in the very low load case. We also compared their performance with solutions, where the IP topology is static and an adaptive routing is applied to route the user traffic.	adaptive filter;algorithm;network planning and design;routing;seasonality;simulation	BalÃ¡zs Farkas;ZoltÃ¡n ZsÃ³ka	2011	2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)		loose source routing;overlay network;traffic grooming;telecommunications;computer science;optical ip switching;ip forwarding;distributed computing;telecommunications network;optical communication;computer network;logical topology	Arch	-5.455067142054225	84.04478920448335	88961
8ecc72b4c2012d131bb83552f2c690831efa07ff	characterizing rule compression mechanisms in software-defined networks		Software-defined networking (SDN) separates the network policy specification from its configuration and gives applications control over the forwarding rules that route traffic. On large networks that host several applications, the number of rules that network switches must handle can easily exceed tens of thousands. Most switches cannot handle rules of this volume because the complex rule matching in SDN (e.g., wildcards, diverse match fields) requires switches to store rules on TCAM, which is expensive and limited in size. We perform a measurement study using two real-world network traffic traces to understand the effectiveness and side-effects of manual and automatic rule compression techniques. Our results show that not using any rule management mechanism is likely to result in a rule set that does not fit on current OpenFlow switches. Using rule expiration timeouts reduces the configuration footprint on a switch without affecting rule semantics but at the expense of up to 40% increase in control channel overhead. Other manual (e.g., wildcards, limiting match fields) or automatic (e.g., combining similar rules) mechanisms introduce negligible overhead but change the original configuration and may misdirect less than 1% of the flows. Our work uncovers trade-offs critical to both operators and programmers writing network policies that must satisfy both infrastructure and application constraints.	aggregate data;algorithm;high- and low-level;network switch;network traffic control;openflow;overhead (computing);programmer;r* tree;software-defined networking;telecommunications access method;tracing (software);wildcard character	Curtis Yu;Cristian Lumezanu;Harsha V.

0c2d443c350082252ca88ba3596b47bc531a25bd	a practical architecture for mobile edge computing		Recently, mobile broadband networks are focused on bringing additional capabilities to the network edge. For instance, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) brings storage and processing capabilities closer to the mobile user i.e., at the radio access network, in order to deploy services with minimum delay. In this paper, we propose a resource constrained cloud-enabled small cell that includes a MEC server for deploying mobile edge computing functionalities. We present the architecture with special focus on realizing the proper forwarding of data packets between the mobile data path and the MEC applications, based on the principles of SDN, without requiring any changes to the functionality of existing mobile network nodes both in the access and the core network segments. The significant benefits of adopting the proposed architecture are analysed based on a proof-of-concept demonstration for content caching application use case.	application programming interface;cache (computing);compaq lte;edge computing;network packet;personalization;radio access network;serial digital video out;server (computing);sesame;software-defined networking	Tejas Subramanya;Leonardo Goratti;Shah Nawaz Khan;Emmanouil Kafetzakis;Ioannis Giannoulakis;Roberto Riggio	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN)	10.1109/NFV-SDN.2017.8169855	mobile broadband;computer network;edge device;mobile edge computing;radio access network;core network;mobile computing;cellular network;edge computing;computer science	Mobile	-14.729153912127991	86.16748829085553	89218

Overlay Networks have emerged as one of the more imaginative ways to harness the underlying network for efficient content distribution and data sharing, faster searches and reliable communications, etc. Scaffold is a technique to build an overlay network for faster data discovery by studying the metadata present in the network, which is a-priori captured in a hypercube, called the Info-Cube. Scaffold triggers the network to build specific overlays in the form of Spanning Trees, making use of the Info-Cubes present in the nodes. Scaffold is designed to enable the network to form multiple overlays dynamically without centralized control. This makes the system self-configuring and enables the network to manage the overlay formation in a distributed fashion.	centralized computing;computer;cube;cubes;digital distribution;internet;overlay network;reliability (computer networking)	Deepak K.

The Benes network is the lowest-cost switching fabric known to yield operation free of internal blocking. Backpressure inside a switching fabric can limit the use of expensive off-chip buffer memory to just virtual-output queues in front of the input stage. This article extends the known credit-based flow control (backpressure) architectures to the Benes network. To achieve this, we had to successfully combine per-flow backpressure, multipath routing (inverse multiplexing), and cell resequencing. We present a flow merging scheme that is needed to bring the cost of backpressure down to O(N) per switching element, and for which we have proved freedom from deadlock for a wide class of multipath cell distribution algorithms. Using a cell-time-accurate simulator, we verify operation free of internal blocking, evaluate various cell distribution and resequencing methods, compare performance to that of ideal output queuing, the iSLIP crossbar scheduling algorithm, and adaptive and randomized routing, and show that the delay of well-behaved flows remains unaffected by the presence of congested traffic to oversubscribed output ports.	blocking (computing);clos network;crossbar switch;deadlock;image scaling;multipath propagation;multipath routing;multiplexing;multistage amplifier;network packet;network switch;overselling;randomized algorithm;scheduling (computing);simulation;switched fabric	Georgios Sapountzis;Manolis Katevenis	2005	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2005.1381880	distributed algorithm;real-time computing;computer science;backpressure routing;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Networks	-5.085439293006138	87.28604791783958	89672

e72e0299c7cfa49e195ec0d89bc86e5339d9d153	a cost efficient multicast nonblocking interconnection network		Interconnection networks lie at the heart of parallel processing architectures for big data, because the way that machines, processors or memory modules connected to each other has a significant effect on the scalability, reliability, cost and performance. For example, an interconnection network with multicast capability can distribute data from a single source to all the destinations in a one-shot manner, eliminating unnecessary duplications and minimizing communication delays. Also, a nonblocking interconnection network delivers guaranteed path availability to any connection requests, without interference to existing connections. However, implementing multicast nonblocking networks imposes great challenges to designers because both of them demand high hardware cost. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel type of interconnection network, named Multicast Capable Low-cost Network (MCL), which is both nonblocking for multicast traffic and cost efficient. We first design the topologies and routing algorithms for MCL, and then prove its multicast nonblocking properties. Most importantly, we show that MCL achieves outstanding cost efficiency. To be specific, our explicitly constructed MCL has the cost of O(N 5 4 ). This hardware cost achieves a new record low, comparing to previous solutions which deliver the same performance.	big data;central processing unit;cost efficiency;dimm;interconnection;interference (communication);macintosh common lisp;monte carlo localization;multicast;non-blocking algorithm;parallel computing;routing;scalability;vii	Jun Duan;Yuanyuan Yang	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254992	computer network;wireless sensor network;multicast;scalability;big data;network topology;algorithm design;interconnection;computer science;cost efficiency	Arch	-11.332745628827999	80.26285945661124	89856

At the same time we are seeing the ever increasing need for the transmission of large amounts of data in real-time and the inability of traditional systems to cope with this new demand. A combination of a number of factors, including advances in fibre-optics and in switching technology, has lead to the emergence of new high-speed networks. The advent of these high-speed networks significantly challenges our classical view of distributed networking. Recently introduced and forthcoming systems reduce end-to-end delays by minimizing processing in the intermediate nodes through more simplified network routing of the packets (e.g., Asynchronous Transfer Mode). The underlying fibre-optics have the potential to provide on the order of gigabits of bandwidth. It is important to study the properties of these networks, such as how they deal with congestion, how to perform multicast on them and how to best measure their performance. The papers in this minitrack address some of these issues.	distributed networking;emergence;end-to-end principle;gigabit;hybrid fibre-coaxial;multicast;network congestion;optical fiber;real-time clock;routing	Evangelos Kranakis;Danny Krizanc	1998		10.1109/HICSS.1998.649240	routing;real-time computing;computer science;asynchronous transfer mode;bandwidth;computer network	Metrics	-7.11848984418665	87.895135871635	89919

However, the dissemination of P2P applications also entails some important challenges that should be carefully addressed. In particular, some of the important coexistence problems existing between P2P applications and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are mainly motivated by the inherent P2P dynamics which cause traffic to scatter across the network links in an unforeseeable way. In this context, this work proposes a collaborative framework of a BitTorrent like system. Using the proposed framework and based on the exchange of valuable information between the application and network levels, some novel techniques are proposed allowing to estimate and control the traffic impact that the P2P system will have on the links of the underlying network infrastructure. Both the framework and the presented techniques were tested resorting to simulation. The results clearly corroborate the viability and effectiveness of the formulated methods.	bittorrent;coexist (image);entity;internet;peer-to-peer;peering;programming paradigm;simulation;swarm	Pedro Sousa	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-09153-2_5	traffic engineering;simulation;computer science;operating system;database;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security;collaboration	Networks	-14.997673048361651	78.17307260463797	89932

74fa44bbdf532d978a812acc948aab9e787927e8	network measurement and performance analysis at server side		Network performance diagnostics is an important topic that has been studied since the Internet was invented. However, it remains a challenging task, while the network evolves and becomes more and more complicated over time. One of the main challenges is that all network components (e.g., senders, receivers, and relay nodes) make decision based only on local information and they are all likely to be performance bottlenecks. Although Software Defined Networking (SDN) proposes to embrace a centralize network intelligence for a better control, the cost to collect complete network states in packet level is not affordable in terms of collection latency, bandwidth, and processing power. With the emergence of the new types of networks (e.g., Internet of Everything, Mission-Critical Control, data-intensive mobile apps, etc.), the network demands are getting more diverse. It is critical to provide finer granularity and real-time diagnostics to serve various demands. In this paper, we present EVA, a network performance analysis tool that guides developers and network operators to fix problems in a timely manner. EVA passively collects packet traces near the server (hypervisor, NIC, or top-of-rack switch), and pinpoints the location of the performance bottleneck (sender, network, or receiver). EVA works without detailed knowledge of application or network stack and is therefore easy to deploy. We use three types of real-world network datasets and perform trace-driven experiments to demonstrate EVAâs accuracy and generality. We also present the problems observed in these datasets by applying EVA.	bottleneck (software);centralisation;conceptualization (information science);correctness (computer science);data curation;data-intensive computing;digital curation;eva (benchmark);eva conferences;emergence;experiment;extended vector animation;hypervisor;internet;mobile app;network congestion;network intelligence;network interface controller;network packet;network performance;profiling (computer programming);protocol stack;real-time clock;relay;server (computing);software-defined networking;tracing (software)	Guang-Qian Peng;Guangtao Xue;Yi-Chao Chen	2018	Future Internet	10.3390/fi10070067	server-side;computer network;protocol stack;latency (engineering);the internet;computer science;network intelligence;software-defined networking;network packet;network performance	Networks	-14.277003476661926	83.05175477539669	90233

Even though some of these protocols avoid the state in intermediate routers, they still have scalability limitations and require explicit network management as well as non-trivial functionality from the network components.  In this work we propose an architecture based on in-packet Bloom filter forwarding, in which the burden of scalability management is left to the multicast source and end-hosts. We present several algorithms to improve the scalability of multicast transmission and evaluate them in a real Internet topology. Our evaluation confirms the ability of the proposed stateless design to save up to 70% of traffic volume in the large scale topology for big groups of subscribers, and up to 30% for small groups.	algorithm;bloom filter;internet topology;multicast;network packet;overhead (computing);router (computing);scalability;software deployment;state (computer science);stateless protocol	Ilya Nikolaevskiy;Andrey Lukyanenko;Tatiana Polishchuk;Valentin Polishchuk;Andrei V.

The motivation is to increase the efficiency of classical SFC of chaining multiple network functions implemented in dedicated virtual machines, especially due to its latency drawbacks for packet transfer. An alternative implementation of a compound SFC implementation in a single virtual machine is proposed. The focus is not primarily on the latency drawback but on an improved resource management. In order to evaluate the presented concepts a traffic model that resembles the traffic pattern of a real network is applied. Example calculations give an indication on the sensitivity of different parameters to efficiency of the SFC implementation options and proposed management solutions.	cloud computing;network packet;performance evaluation;space-filling curve;virtual machine	Wolfgang Hahn;Borislava Gajic;Christian Mannweiler	2016	NOMS 2016 - 2016 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium	10.1109/NOMS.2016.7503007	acceleration;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;resource management;operating system;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Networks	-12.874226759546682	84.21672977492626	90697

In this method, each Internet host is assigned a computed co-ordinate where the distance between any two arbitrary hosts is approximated by their Euclidean distance. In this paper, we investigate whether such co-ordinate based method can be leveraged in designing efficient overlay based routing path for peer-to-peer streaming. Specifically we explore the usage of co-ordinate based estimation with well known Delaunay Triangulation (DT) based routing path design for peer-to-peer streaming. We devise algorithms for this combined approach that we refer as e-DT. Using real measurement data sets, we show that e-DT improves the overlay based routing significantly over purely DT based approach. The comparison with other well known overlay based routing approaches indicates that e-DT is able to construct similar overlay paths with smaller average forwarding degree requirements at each peering node. In addition, e-DT can support both point-to-multi point and multi point to multi point streaming requirements.	approximation algorithm;delaunay triangulation;euclidean distance;host (network);peer-to-peer;peering;requirement;routing;scalability;simulation	Sanghwan Lee;Sambit Sahu	2010	2010 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium - NOMS 2010	10.1109/NOMS.2010.5488374	internet hosting service;mesh generation;routing;the internet;overlay network;delaunay triangulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;coordinate system;peer-to-peer;euclidean distance;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer network;unicast	Embedded	-11.480746572238075	76.93123633827209	90762

We discuss how it solves the mentioned problems. Real-world measurements and simulation results give an idea of QoS properties. A case study of controlling a mobile robot is presented. The results show that the middleware is well suited for non-critical control and monitoring tasks.	embedded system;heisenbug;interconnection;mesh networking;middleware;mobile robot;multicast;network packet;publishâsubscribe pattern;quality of service;real-time operating system;real-time transcription;requirement;runtime system;simulation;software propagation;telecommunications network;wireless mesh network	AndrÃ© Herms;Michael Schulze;JÃ¶rg Kaiser;Edgar Nett	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation	10.1109/ETFA.2008.4638465	mobile robot;embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;artificial intelligence;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	-18.275741135641073	80.70590780070613	90943

2d7e794403dc47cd3a3eacd44458a01df117721f	on the impact of indirect wan routing on geo-replicated storage		Micro-clouds infrastructures allow supporting applications on local and energy-efficient resources. Communication between micro-clouds takes place on shared and non-dedicated Internet links. Network control and optimization can only happen at the edge. For availability and persistence, the storage of application data must be geo-replicated. Maintaining strong data consistency under concurrent accesses requires delay-sensitive coherence protocols, linking the performance of the storage to that of the network between micro-clouds. We evaluate if the use of network control at the edge of a European-wide multi-site testbed, together with appropriate network monitoring, can allow improving the performance of ZooKeeper, a strongly-consistent replicated store. Our approach leverages the indirect routing of coherence protocol traffic in the presence of network triangle equality violations. We analyze the impact on storage of variations in WAN performance, and show how the use of traffic redirection can help reducing it.	cache coherence;computer data storage;conflict-free replicated data type;flow network;internet;mathematical optimization;network function virtualization;persistence (computer science);routing;software-defined networking;testbed;traffic exchange	Raziel Carvajal GÃ³mez;Eduard-Florentin Luchian;Iustin-Alexandru Ivanciu;Adrian Taut;Virgil Dobrota;Etienne RiviÃ¨re	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Local and Metropolitan Area Networks (LANMAN)	10.1109/LANMAN.2017.7972171	distributed computing;computer network;network monitoring;the internet;cloud computing;computer science;data consistency;server;persistence (computer science);testbed;coherence (physics)	Arch	-10.425013092660725	79.48262921534648	91589

The problems that we address relate to scalability in stacked overlay networks and network equipment with asynchronous clocks, which complicates the problem of event correlation. We describe a cross-layer protocol designed to address these problems, operating in a fully distributed manner and taking into account asynchronous timestamps. It is assumed that events in one layer may arise from a series of events in lower layers. Detected events that are spatially related in one layer are aggregated using a gossip-like protocol, and constitute a root cause. The set of aggregated events is disseminated to lower layers and used for temporal correlation. We have tested the scalability and the performance of the distributed event protocol, using both synthetically generated and real-world topologies. The results indicate that the average overhead produced for collecting events down the stack of overlays increases with the number of layers. For a fixed number of layers, the protocol scales similarly with the graph-theoretic properties for a network of increasing size.	asynchronous circuit;communications protocol;event correlation;gossip protocol;graph property;graph theory;layer (electronics);overhead (computing);overlay network;scalability;statistical model	Rebecca Steinert;S.

Today's SDN platforms force programmers to decide how to decompose a high-level policy into the low-level rules in each switch. We argue that future SDN platforms should support automatic transformation of policies by moving, merging, or splitting rules across multiple switches. This would simplify programming by allowing programs written on one abstract switch to run over a more complex network topology, and simplify analysis by consolidating a policy spread over multiple switches into a single list of rules. This poster presents our ongoing work on a sound and complete set of axioms for policy transformation, to enable rewriting of rules across multiple switches while preserving the forwarding policy. These axioms are invaluable for creating and analyzing algorithms for optimizing the rewriting of rules.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;complex network;high- and low-level;network packet;network switch;network topology;programmer;rewriting;software-defined networking	Nanxi Kang;Joshua Reich;Jennifer Rexford;David Walker	2012		10.1145/2342356.2342424	openflow;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;software-defined networking;computer security;complex network;computer network	PL	-16.62529641239136	81.85102294244697	92037

WDM technology establishes communication between pairs of network nodes by establishing transmitterâreceiver paths and assigning wavelengths to each path so that no two paths going through the same fiber link use the same wavelength. Optical bandwidth is the number of distinct wavelengths. Since stateâofâtheâart technology allows for a limited number of wavelengths, the engineering problem to be solved is to establish communication between pairs of nodes so that the total number of wavelengths used is minimized; this is known as the wavelength routing problem. In this paper we survey recent advances in bandwidth allocation in treeâshaped WDM allâoptical networks. We present hardness results and lower bounds for the general problem and the special case of symmetric communication. We give the main ideas of deterministic greedy algorithms and study their limitations. We demonstrate how we can achieve optimal and nearlyâoptimal bandwidth utilization in networks with wavelength converters using simple algorithms. We also present recent results about the use of randomization for wavelength routing.	greedy algorithm;routing;transmitter;wavelength-division multiplexing	Christos Kaklamanis	2001	Proceedings 15th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium.

The barrier to a more widespread use of Tor is a variety of performance problems. We focused on enhancing Tor circuits by selecting the relays on the basis of assigned performance flags, which are known as a guard, fast and stable flags. We observed that these simple strategies can improve the selection method for relays with high bandwidth and TCP advertised window sizes. In this work, we regard bandwidth as the key factor in Tor design and path selection. We determine a better method of circuit selection based on actively measuring RTTs, TCP throughput and the TCP advertised window sizes of the relays.	computer and network surveillance;internet;load balancing (computing);performance tuning;quality of service;relay;throughput;tor messenger	Kale Timothy Girry;Satoshi Ohzahata;Celimuge Wu;Toshihiko Kato	2013	2013 15th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)		telecommunications;computer science;zeta-tcp;routing protocol;tcp acceleration;computer security;transport layer;computer network	Security	-12.6482910573804	78.36648983269498	92135

In this paper, we develop a family of optimization-based distributed traffic control laws to meet this challenge. This family of control laws enables Quality of Service (QoS), Traffic Engineering (TE), and Failure Recovery (FR) features simultaneously in a network where the link capacities and CoS requirement may vary with time. The approach taken relies on the concept of Sliding Modes to solve the resulting time-varying optimization problem. Running at the edge of a network, a set of control laws selected from this family enables class-of-service-based multi-path load balancing and/or rate adaptation to respond to network congestion, CoS requirement variation and link failures. The only nonlocal information needed as input to the control laws is the number of congested links along a forwarding path. This family of control laws is particularly viable to be implemented in a software-defined network (SDN) where the available underlying resources may not be accurately predictable and vary with time, due to, e.g., network virtualization.	quality of service	Wenjing Su;Constantino M.

9b3b98bb65d67f3187d3e16845e4e91b029d4d24	optics in data centers: adapting to diverse modern workloads	optical switches;hybrid data center networks	Over the recent years we witness a massive growth of cloud usage, accelerated by new types of 'born-to-the-cloud' workloads. These new types of workloads are increasingly multi-component, dynamic and often present highly intensive communication patterns. Massive innovation of Data Center Network (DCN) technologies is required to support the demand, giving raise to new network topologies, new network control paradigms, and management models. One particularly promising technology candidate for improving the DCN efficiency is Optical Circuit Switching (OCS).  Several hybrid solutions combining OCS with the traditional Electronic Packet Switching (EPS) have been proposed [1, 2], aiming to take advantage of the benefits of the OCS technology (e.g., high bandwidth, low latency and power consumption) while leveling out its shortcomings (e.g., slow reconfiguration time, integration with IP fabric). The first comprehensive work advocating OCS for DCN [1] considered HPC workloads with semi-static communication patterns. Follow up works, such as Helios [2], proposed new ways for identifying heavy flows, heuristics for computing the circuits configuration, and control hooks for dispatching the traffic over EPS and OCS paths. In yet newer works, e.g. [3], further advances were made -- supporting richer sets of communication patterns, employing Software Defined Networking (SDN) to steer the traffic and to achieve more reactive control planes in anticipation for faster OCS capabilities, and more.  We observe that in hybrid solutions, the basic approach remains the same -- the network is partitioned between the two separate fabrics, one based on OCS and one based on EPS, so that each network flow is handled by one of the fabrics, depending on its properties.  In this work, we present a new architecture where optical circuitry does not merely augment the EPS but is properly integrated with it into a coherently managed unified fabric. Our approach is based on understanding that modern workloads impose diverse traffic demands. Specifically, we identify the abundance of few-to-many and many-to-few communication patterns with multiple dynamic hot spots and observe that such traffic is better served by tighter integration of OCS and EPS achieved through introducing composite paths across the OCS-EPS boundaries.  As a preliminary proof of concept, we have evaluated our architecture and compared it to the previously proposed hybrid solutions, considering the known uniform and skewed, as well as few-to-many and many-to-few demand models. For each traffic pattern, we evaluate both whether it can be met by each of the solutions and, if yes, the resulting link utilization. Our preliminary results show a significant improvement in both these metrics -- the feasibility and the link utilization. Looking forward, we plan to expand this research and explore a new thread of opportunities for leveraging the reconfiguration capabilities of contemporary OCS, posing it as a viable DCN technology.

The penalty being the generation of a higher than normal congestion ratio in non-failures scenario when the link weight set used in our network only targets the failure scenario. PSO-NP determines a suitable set of OSPF link weights at the start time that can handle any link failure scenario preventively while suppressing the penalty for the non-failure scenario. Previously, a preventive start time optimisation was presented to minimize the worst case congestion ratio in case of failure. That scheme unfortunately presents a non-negligible penalty when there is no link failure in the network because it only focuses on the failure scenario. In this paper we consider both the worst case failure scenario and the non-failure scenario.We suppress that penalty while enhancing the Preventive Start-Time scheme to counter failures. Simulation results show that PSO-NP achieves substantial congestion reduction for any failure case while eliminating the penalty in case of no failures in the network.	best, worst and average case;mathematical optimization;network congestion;optimizing compiler;particle swarm optimization;simulation;single point of failure	Stephane Kaptchouang;Ihsen Aziz OuÃ©draogo;Eiji Oki	2013	2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2013.6766051	reliability engineering;real-time computing;engineering;computer network	Robotics	-7.204276705705264	81.92436544077091	92983

Cognitive networking was introduced to deal with this problem, by providing algorithms for autonomous network management and protocol reconfiguration. In this paper, we propose a framework for cognitive configuration and optimization of communication protocols called CogProt. CogProt is a distributed framework that allows dynamic reconfiguration of operational protocol stack parameters for optimizing protocol performance under changing network conditions. As a proof of concept, the framework is illustrated for the cognitive configuration of TCP congestion window evolution. In this setup, the TCP window increase factor is adjusted in runtime based on the TCP goodput experienced in the immediate past. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cognitive framework is able to improve average TCP performance under changing network conditions.	algorithm;autonomous robot;cognition;cognitive network;communications protocol;goodput;mathematical optimization;network congestion;protocol stack;simulation;tcp congestion control	Dzmitry Kliazovich;Neumar Malheiros;Nelson Luis Saldanha da Fonseca;Fabrizio Granelli;Edmundo Roberto Mauro Madeira	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16644-0_25	communications protocol;computer science;link control protocol;operating system;computer network;internetwork protocol	Networks	-12.334626896494726	83.15065136938112	93401

In this paper, we propose a novel server-centric network structure called RCube, which is energy efficient and can deploy a redundancy scheme to improve the availability of data centers. Moreover, RCube shares many good properties with BCube, a well known server-centric network structure, yet its network size can be adjusted more conveniently. We also present a routing algorithm to find paths in RCube and an algorithm to find multiple parallel paths between any pair of source and destination servers. In addition, we theoretically analyze the power efficiency of the network and availability of RCube under server failure. Our comprehensive simulations demonstrate that RCube provides higher availability and flexibility to make trade-off among many factors, such as power consumption and aggregate throughput, than BCube, while delivering similar performance to BCube in many critical metrics, such as average path length, path distribution and graceful degradation, which makes RCube a very promising empirical structure for an enterprise data center network product.	aggregate data;algorithm;average path length;data center;dynamic circuit network;elegant degradation;fault tolerance;high availability;network planning and design;performance per watt;recursion;recursive definition;routing;server (computing);simulation;throughput	Zhenhua Li;Yuanyuan Yang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2017.2762297	computer science;throughput;redundancy (engineering);electrical efficiency;distributed computing;high availability;average path length;fault tolerance;server;enterprise data management	Networks	-11.425579740115404	80.39747136908538	93472

In this paper, we present mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations to analyze multiple interior-disjoint-tree-based and mesh-based P2P media streaming for application level multicast (ALM). Network optimization is the key to simultaneously satisfy a large group (potentially millions) of peers' needs given limited network resources. The key to our analytical approach is to cast the P2P media streaming problem as a constraint system. We intend to answer the following question: given a source node, a group of intended destination peer nodes with heterogeneous network resources, and an objective function to optimize, what is the best way to distribute information among these peer nodes? To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations in the framework of multiple interior-disjoint trees and mesh-based P2P streaming are presented to provide analytical insight and better understanding of the P2P streaming problem. Methods to obtain the optimal solutions for the presented formulations are also discussed.	integer programming;linear programming;loss function;mathematical optimization;multicast;optimization problem;peer-to-peer;streaming media	Fulu Li;Jianwei Huang;Andrew Lippman	2008	2008 42nd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems	10.1109/CISS.2008.4558688	communications protocol;real-time computing;the internet;media;integer programming;heterogeneous network;computer science;theoretical computer science;peer-to-peer;distributed computing;bandwidth;robustness;computer network;satisfiability	DB	-5.203320371863641	83.08401254586333	93884

However, most production large-scale InfiniBand clusters use simple routing schemes such as the destination-mod-k routing to route traffic, which may result in degraded communication performance. In this work, we investigate using the OpenFlow-style Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology to overcome the routing deficiency in InfiniBand. We design an enhanced InfiniBand with OpenFlow-style SDN capability and demonstrate a use case that illustrates how the SDN capability can be exploited in HPC clusters to improve the system and application performance. Finally, we quantify the potential benefits of InfiniBand with OpenFlow-style SDN capability in balancing the network load by simulating job traces from production HPC clusters. The results indicate that InfiniBand with SDN capability can achieve much better network load balancing than traditional InfiniBand for HPC clusters.	angular defect;infiniband;load balancing (computing);network load balancing;openflow;routing;simulation;software-defined networking;supercomputer;tracing (software)	Jason Lee;Zhou Tong;Karthik Achalkar;Xin Yuan;Michael Lang	2016	SC16: International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis		openflow;communications protocol;routing;parallel computing;fat tree;network switch;computer science;resource management;operating system;distributed computing;software-defined networking;computer network	HPC	-12.934060156392485	81.00383342910409	93984

Our approach divides the network into layers, and the equivalent path technique is used to model each path as an equivalent single-link system. The analysis of the performance measurements for an equivalent single-link system is based on a superposition concept using the Kaufman/Delbrouck recursion model.

2c7325d3680521efc5d6d6e87fd041975cc3d7ff	the structure of service level agreement of slice-based 5g network		Network slicing is considered to be one of the key enablers to Fifth Generation (5G) communication system. Legacy telecommunication networks have been providing various services to all kinds of customers through a single network infrastructure. In contrast, with the deployment of network slicing, operators are now able to partition entire network into different slices, each with its own configuration and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. There are many applications across industry, each needs an independent slice with its own functions and features. All these applications open new business opportunities, which require new business models and therefore every single slice needs an individual Service Level Agreement (SLA). In this paper, we proposed a comprehensive end-to-end structure of SLA between tenant and service provider of slicebased 5G network, which balances the interests of both sides. The proposed SLA is expected to define reliability, availability, and performance of delivered telecommunication services in order to ensure that right information gets to the right destination at right time, safely and securely. We also discussed the metrics of slicebased network SLA such as throughput, penalty, cost, revenue, profit, and QoS related metrics, which we think are very critical to be considered during the agreement.	authorization;end-to-end encryption;fifth generation computer;quality of service;requirement;service-level agreement;software deployment;throughput	Mohammad Asif Habibi;Bin Han;Meysam Nasimi;Hans D.

We focus on two optical technologies, namely currently the most popular Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) and a new emerging approach of Elastic Optical Network (EON). The performance metrics related to both: optical network resources (network CAPEX/OPEX cost, power consumption optical spectrum usage) and computing resources (response time and OPEX cost) are investigated in pan-European and United States networks based on the example big data application related to hyperspectral image processing. Results indicate that provisioning of big data traffic directly in the optical layer with the use of the EON concept provides the best results in most of examined criteria.	big data;cloud computing;cost efficiency;image processing;internet backbone;provisioning;response time (technology);scalability;wavelength-division multiplexing	Krzysztof Walkowiak;Michal Wozniak;Miroslaw Klinkowski;Wojciech Kmiecik	2015	IJPEDS	10.1080/17445760.2014.924516	big data;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;world wide web;computer security;computer network	ML	-10.42478087607119	84.23765753365129	94873

When lightpaths of heterogeneous bandwidths co-exist, two factors emerge that will degrade the provisioning efficiency and negatively impact its sustainable evolution: (1) unfairness of access among different bandwidth connections, and (2) spectrum fragmentation caused by bandwidth mismatch. We have devised a comprehensive metric, Fragmentation Index, to capture the essence of fragmentation. Through analysis and simulations, we show that an admission policy that differentiates different bandwidth lightpaths by spectrum partitioning achieves better provisioning efficiency by resolving these	algorithm;binary space partitioning;blocking (computing);cluster analysis;fairness measure;fork (software development);fragmentation (computing);provisioning;simulation	Rui Wang;Biswanath Mukherjee	2014	Optical Switching and Networking	10.1016/j.osn.2013.09.003	spectrum management;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;fragmentation;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Networks	-7.7526226141048395	85.13199647816096	95023

Furthermore, each end user could belong to different domains, so in order to give services to this user from a different domain, roaming must be supported.

By integrated, the authors mean that the provisioning mechanism takes into account network topology, resource and resilience information in both the IP and WDM layers. By dynamic, the authors mean that the establishment process of connections and lightpaths is based on the fact that the arrivals and departures of IP traffic connections are not known in advance. By heterogenous, the authors mean that the state routing algorithms function on the fact that optical nodes in WDM network may support different switching capabilities. This has been achieved through our proposed scheme which operates based on a dual link metrics (bandwidth,delay)routing algorithm inter-operating with efficient connections and lightpaths rerouting algorithms. A genetic algorithm is introduced to operate based on the solution space generated by this scheme in order to minimise the total cost of network operation. The authors have conducted simulations, where the results show that this scheme enables IP-over-WDM networks to guarantee the quality-of-service and resilience required for heterogenous traffic classes with effective and efficient allocation of network resources.	digital visual interface;feasible region;genetic algorithm;network topology;provisioning;quality of service;routing;simulation;wavelength-division multiplexing	Hamada Alshaer;Jaafar M.

f19eeb914a27e9e9fe8b2d13190a2156a13a1c7f	adaptive ttl control to minimize resource cost in hierarchical caching networks		SUMMARY Content caching networks like Information-Centric Networking (ICN) are beneficial to reduce the network traffic by storing content data on routers near to users. In ICN, it becomes an important issue to manage system resources, such as storage and network bandwidth, which are influenced by cache characteristics of each cache node. Meanwhile, cache aging techniques based on Time-To-Live (TTL) of content facilitate analyzing cache characteristics and can realize appropriate resource management by setting efficient TTLs. However, it is difficult to search for the efficient TTLs in a distributed cache system connected by multiple cache nodes. Therefore, we propose an adaptive control mechanism of the TTL value of content in distributed cache systems by using predictive models which can estimate the impact of the TTL values on network resources and cache performance. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.	cpu cache;cache (computing);distributed cache;icn gps;network traffic control;predictive modelling;time to live;transistorâtransistor logic	Satoshi Imai;Kenji Leibnitz;Masayuki Murata	2015	IEICE Transactions		real-time computing;computer science;newton's method;smart cache;internet privacy;computer network	HPC	-14.626193480118879	74.90378364915486	95408

Our solution does not require any changes to network functions and is able to handle stateful network functions for which states may depend on both directions of the traffic. We use connection-aware traffic load balancers based on hashing function to maintain mappings between connections and the dynamically changing network function chains. Our references implementation uses OpenFlow switches to route traffic to the assigned network function instances according to the load balancer decisions. We conducted extensive simulations to test the feasibility of the architecture and evaluate the performance of our implementation.

Traditionally, the concept of predefined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) has been utilized to establish QoS parameters. However, most state-of-the-art technologies in this area are both proprietary and inflexible. To this end, Software Defined Networking (SDN) has the potential to make network management tasks flexible, scalable, and an open platform to encourage innovation. In this paper, we present the design of PolicyCop, an open, flexible, and vendor agnostic QoS policy management framework targeted towards OpenFlow based SDN. PolicyCop provides an interface for specifying QoS SLAs and then exploits the control plane's API to enforce them. PolicyCop also monitors the network and autonomically readjusts network parameters to meet customer SLAs. We present experimental results to demonstrate PolicyCop's effectiveness in ensuring throughput, latency, and reliability guarantees.	application programming interface;autonomic computing;control plane;little big adventure;open platform;openflow;quality of service;requirement;scalability;service-level agreement;software-defined networking;throughput	Md.

We provide results of an investigation of the applicability of 6LoWPAN with RPL mesh networks for home and building automation use cases. The proper selection of Trickle parameters and neighbor reachable time-outs is important in the RPL protocol suite to respond efficiently to any path failure. These parameters were analyzed in the context of energy consumption w.r.t the number of control packets. The measurements were performed in an Automated Physical Testbeds (APTB). The results match the recommendation by RFC 7733 for selecting various parameters of RPL protocol suite. This paper shows the relationship between various RPL parameters and control traffic overhead during network rebuild. Comparative measurement results with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in this work showed that 6Lo with RPL outperformed BLE in this use case with less control traffic overheads.	bluetooth;internet of things;mesh networking;overhead (computing);protocol stack;scalability;test case;testbed	E.

ab117679aeb9deadda95407588d517034e3f9c64	power efficient resource allocation algorithms for provisioning in sdh networks		Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) is a widely used technology in access and core networks for carrying different types of traffic. It defines a hierarchy for multiplexing lower rate traffic containers into higher rate traffic containers. Provisioning refers to the process of allocation of resources to carry a given traffic demand. Due to the continued expansion of the networks employing SDH technology, the power consumption of the network increases becoming a bottleneck for further expansion. Allocation of resources to traffic demands in power-efficient ways will therefore help in minimizing the capital and operational costs in running the network. In this work, the power consumed by a switch matrix having the capability to switch different traffic containers in different amounts is considered. The objective is to minimize the number of network elements deployed in the network by allocating resources to traffic demands in power-efficient ways. A formulation based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is presented; three different heuristic approaches, based on how higher order trails are used and the use of grooming, are proposed. It is found that the grooming-based heuristic performs better in terms of the total power consumption relative to the weighted number of requests accepted. It is also found that, for small networks, the grooming heuristic performs identical to the optimal solution found by an LP solver when the problem is feasible. It can be noted that the power-efficient design is also a cost-efficient design since the capacity of the switch matrix determines the number of network elements that are required for deployment in the network.	algorithm;cost efficiency;heuristic;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;lp-type problem;linear programming;memory management;multiplexing;provisioning;software deployment;solver;synchronous optical networking;wavelength-division multiplexing	Madanagopal Ramachandran;Krishna M.

Cooperative caching systems are more effective than independent caches due to the larger collective backing store that cooperation creates. One such system currently being developed at UCLA, Adaptive Web Caching (AWC), uses an application-level forwarding table to locate the nearest copy of a requested URLâs contents. This paper describes one specific design in AWC, a simple URL table compression algorithm allowing efficient content information sharing among neighboring caches. The compression algorithm is based on a hierarchical URL decomposition to aggregate URLs sharing common prefixes and an incremental hashing function to minimize collisions between prefixes. The algorithmâs collision rate is derived analytically and verified by five sets of Web trace data. The results demonstrate that the collision rate is bounded and has little impact on page fetching latency. Finally, this compression method is compared to the Summary Cache method.

To do so the NBI has to allow applications to express their requirements and constraints in their own application specific language, and the SDN controller to translate those requirements into SDN network specific language for provisioning network resources and services to satisfy the application requirements. The intent-based NBI is born from this consideration and the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) provides principles and guidelines to build such an intent-based NBI. However, these principles do not lend themselves readily to the design and practical realization of an intent-based NBI for extended classes of business-like network applications. This paper introduces a solution and its initial implementation in the form of a novel architecture for realizing the intent-based NBI. The new solution exploits the modularized and reuse features of the micro services and service oriented architectures.		Minh Pham;Doan B.

6d78bc480ae9af8c1e8cf8060b18f1e4c7aeaed0	hawkflow: scheme for scalable hierarchically distributed control in software defined network		ï âCompared with the traditional design of network architecture, Software Defined Network (SDN) can be programmed to provide more flexible, fine-grained and differentiated services because of its control centralization property. However, with a variety of network functions such as firewall and multicast are gradually added to the SDN controller, the heavy computational load on SDN control plane has made it the bottleneck of whole network architecture in large scale networks. Among all the solutions proposed in the literature, distributed control plane is very promising in solving the problem. This paper presents HawkFlow, a scheme based on hierarchically distributed control plane, to improve the efficiency and scalability of SDN control plane. HawkFlow proposes blocking island theory and network aggregation mechanism to reduce the searching space of Centralized Single Controller Routing (CSR) algorithms. Routing requests are divided into three levels according to the destination IP address, in which routing processes in local networks are designed to be CSR to reduce the average routing complexity. Experimental results show that the mechanisms discussed in this paper can greatly improve the efficiency of hierarchically distributed control plane, especially in the networks with large proportions of local network traffic such as data centers or campus networks.	algorithm;backup;blocking (computing);centralized computing;control plane;data center;differentiated services;distributed control system;experiment;firewall (computing);multicast;network architecture;network traffic control;open-source software;routing;scalability;software-defined networking;time complexity	Xiangyang Zhu;Bing Chen;Hong-yan Qian	2016	JCM	10.12720/jcm.11.10.910-917	parallel computing;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	Networks	-13.180948798387268	82.77534892479824	96996

In a large scale DC, a great number of switches connect servers into one complex network. The energy consumption of this communication network has skyrocketed and become the same league as the computing servers' costs. More than one-third of the total energy in DCs is consumed by communication links, switching and aggregation elements. Saving Data Center Network (DCN) energy to improve data center efficiency (power usage effectiveness or PUE) become the key technique in green computing. In this paper, we present VPTCA as an energy-efficient data center network planning solution that collectively deals with virtual machine placement and communication traffic configuration. VPTCA aims to reduce the DCN's energy consumption. In particular, interrelated VMs are assigned into the same server or pod, which effectively helps to reduce the amount of transmission load. In the layer of traffic message, VPTCA optimally uses switch ports and link bandwidth to balance the load and avoid congestions, enabling DCN to increase its transmission capacity, and saving a significant amount of network energy. In our evaluation via NS-2 simulations, the performance of VPTCA is measured and compared with two well-known DCN management algorithms, Global First Fit and Elastic Tree. Based on our experimental results, VPTCA outperforms existing algorithms in providing DCN more transmission capacity with less energy consumption.	algorithm;cloud computing;complex network;composite application;data center;dynamic circuit network;load balancing (computing);network congestion;network switch;plain old documentation;power usage effectiveness;server (computing);simulation;software release life cycle;telecommunications network;the australian;transmitter;virtual machine	Ting Yang;Young Choon Lee;Albert Y.

538fb9b248bdba23793f23a252195b90960e469c	greedy constructions of optical queues with a limited number of recirculations		"""One of the main problems in all-optical packet-switched networks is the lack of optical buffers, and currently the only known feasible technology for the constructions of optical buffers is to use optical crossbar Switches and fiber Delay Lines (SDLs). In this paper, we consider SDL constructions of optical queues with a limited number of recirculations through the optical switches and the fiber delay lines. Such a problem arises from practical feasibility considerations, such as crosstalk, power loss, amplified spontaneous emission from the Erbium doped fiber amplifiers, and the pattern effect of the optical switches. We first transform the design of the fiber delays in such SDL constructions into an equivalent integer representation problem. Specifically, given <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$1\leq k\leq M$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, we seek for an <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$M$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-sequence <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\mathbf{d}}_{M}=(d_{1},d_{2},\ldots, d_{M})$ </tex-math></inline-formula> of positive integers to maximize the number of consecutive integers (starting from 0) that can be represented by the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\mathcal{ C}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-transform (a generalization of the well-known binary representation) with respect to <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\mathbf{d}}_{M}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> such that there are at most <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> 1-entries in their <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\mathcal{ C}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-transforms. Then, we propose a class of greedy constructions of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\mathbf{d}}_{M}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, in which <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$d_{1},d_{2},\ldots, d_{M}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> are obtained recursively in a greedy manner so that the number of representable consecutive integers by using <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$d_{1},d_{2},\ldots, d_{i}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is larger than that by using <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$d_{1},d_{2},\ldots, d_{i-1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> for all <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$i$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. Finally, we show that every optimal construction (in the sense of maximizing the number of representable consecutive integers) must be a greedy construction. As a result, the complexity of searching for an optimal construction can be greatly reduced from exponential time to polynomial time by only considering the greedy constructions rather than performing an exhaustive search. The solution of such an integer representation problem can be applied to the constructions of optical 2-to-1 FIFO multiplexers with a limited number of recirculations. Similar results can be obtained for the constructions of optical linear compressors/decompressors with a limited number of recirculations."""	amplifier;binary number;brute-force search;crossbar switch;crosstalk;data compression;doping (semiconductor);exptime;fifo (computing and electronics);greedy algorithm;multiplexer;network packet;network switch;optical switch;packet switching;polynomial;recursion;spontaneous order;time complexity;well-known text;whole earth 'lectronic link	Jay Cheng;Cheng-Shang Chang;Sheng-Hua Yang;Tsz-Hsuan Chao;Duan-Shin Lee;Ching-Min Lien	2017	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2017.2710195	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	-5.38537056718607	80.8450727868978	97498

An efficient updating scheme with configuration consistency is required. In this paper, we propose a fast incremental consistent update scheme (FICUS) for SDN that is based on a new structure â relation graph (RG). In our scheme, we analyze the relations between update operations, construct the RG and find the proper order of these update operations to avoid inconsistencies. In the RG, we first define two types of relations: the path dependency relation and the path rejection relation. Then, we analyze the properties of the RG and show how we accelerate the calculation of the update order with the help of the RG. To overcome the loops that may exist in the RG, we use two dividing algorithms to break the loops. We also evaluate our scheme and algorithms through comprehensive experiments. The results show that our scheme needs only 10%-40% of the rules compared with the two-phase update scheme and accelerates the update process by 40% on average.	algorithm;dependency relation;experiment;incremental backup;path dependence;recurrence relation;rejection sampling;residential gateway;software-defined networking;two-phase commit protocol	Qing Li;Lei Wang;Yong Jiang;Mingwei Xu;Jianping Wu	2017	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2017.05.005	distributed computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;dependency relation;software-defined networking;division (mathematics);graph	Security	-8.215003962245019	80.54896050755008	97797

The traffic has been logged and is now analyzed to gather information of 6to4 and IPv6 deployment.Among other figures, we note that the number of 6to4 capable nodes has increased by an order of magnitude in half a year: in April 2004, there are records of about 2 million different 6to4 nodes using this particular relay. Vast majority of this is just testing the availability of the relay, done by the Microsoft Windows systems, but the real traffic has also increased over time.While the observed 6to4 traffic has typically consisted of relatively simple system-level applications, or applications by power users, the emergence of peer-to-peer applications such as BitTorrent was also observed.	bittorrent;emergence;funet;microsoft windows;peer-to-peer;relay;router (computing);software deployment	Pekka Savola	2004	Computer Communication Review	10.1145/1052812.1052821	bittorrent;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;ipv6;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-16.738646136801293	76.93696717361489	97851

Our optimization goal is to minimize the expected cost of correcting (i.e., diagnosing and repairing) all faulty overlay nodes that cannot properly deliver data. Instead of first checking the most likely faulty nodes as in conventional fault localization problems, we prove that an optimal strategy should start with checking one of the candidate nodes, which are identified based on a potential function that we develop. We propose several efficient heuristics for inferring the best node to be checked in large-scale networks. By extensive simulation, we show that we can infer the best node in at least 95 percent of time, and that first checking the candidate nodes rather than the most likely faulty nodes can decrease the checking cost of correcting all faulty nodes.	end-to-end encryption;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;node (computer science);operand forwarding;overlay network;simulation	Patrick P.

However, this multi-tier architecture along with stringent latency requirements in 5G brings new challenges in security provisioning due to the potential frequent handovers and authentications in 5G small cells and HetNets. In this article, we review related studies and introduce SDN into 5G as a platform to enable efficient authentication hand-over and privacy protection. Our objective is to simplify authentication handover by global management of 5G HetNets through sharing of userdependent security context information among related access points.

Many advantages can be provided by this direct communication paradigm such as high data rate, traffic offloading, range extension, as well as proximity services and social networking. In such a context, service discovery approaches need to be investigated. In this paper, we propose two protocols for service discovery, namely, reactive (pull) discovery and proactive (push) discovery in infrastructure-coordinated D2D networks. The protocol overhead is calculated and numerical results are provided in order to compare these two protocols. Performance evaluation and simulation results show that the reactive protocol performs better when there are few D2D users whereas the proactive protocol is preferable if the D2D communication demand is high.	communications protocol;data rate units;fits;multicast;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;programming paradigm;service discovery;simulation	Faustin Ahishakiye;Frank Y.

In todayÂ¿s networks control and forwarding functions are tightly coupled and embedded within each switch/router. SDN, in contrast, accumulates the control functionality in one or more dedicated network entities called controllers, which provide a unified interface to configure and control the network. Packet forwarding, on the other hand, remains the responsibility of the switches/routers. Many datacenter networks have benefited from the abstraction provided by SDN. However, in a Wide Area Network (WAN) a single controller becomes a performance bottleneck. Multiple controller solutions are proposed as a natural consequence. In this article we present the requirements, design alternatives, and a possible management architecture for a single administrative domain WA-SDN. We also discuss the functional components that should be present in a multi-controller architecture for managing WA-SDN deployments.	administrative domain;data center;embedded system;entity;network switch;requirement;router (computing);software-defined networking;wa-tor	Reaz Ahmed;Raouf Boutaba	2014	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2014.6852092	routing;edge device;real-time computing;wireless wan;network architecture;frame relay;network management station;computer science;network simulation;distributed computing;packet forwarding;network management application;computer network	Networks	-14.607698659680866	83.32186881206049	98535

Despite their importance, to our best knowledge, large-scale analysis of CDN cache performance is lacking in prior literature. A CDN serves many content publishers simultaneously and thus has unique workload characteristics; it typically deals with extremely large content volume and high content diversity from multiple content publishers. CDNs also have unique performance metrics; other than hit ratio, CDNs also need to minimize network and disk load on cache servers. In this paper, we present measurement and analysis of caching workload at a large commercial CDN. Using detailed logs from four geographically distributed CDN cache servers, we analyze over 600 million content requests accounting for more than 1.3 petabytes worth of traffic. We analyze CDN workload from a wide range of perspectives, including request composition, size, popularity, and temporal dynamics. Using real-world logs, we also evaluate cache replacement algorithms, including two enhancements designed based on our CDN workload analysis: N-hit and content-aware caching. The results show that these enhancements achieve substantial performance gains in terms of cache hit ratio, disk load, and origin traffic volume.	algorithm;bloom filter;cache (computing);content delivery network;hit (internet);petabyte	Muhammad Zubair Shafiq;Amir R.

522b7ff1baa5613d327fc71e12675277d29c6489	fragmentation-aware routing, wavelength and spectrum assignment (rwsa) scheme in flex-grid optical networks		Flex-grid optical network is a promising solution to meet the ever increasing varied traffic demands by virtue of its capability to efficiently utilize the limited spectral resources in fiber optic communication. However, in a dynamic network scenario, setting up and tearing down connections with heterogeneous data rates can fragment the spectral resources into non-contiguous small spectrum voids, thereby rendering them unusable for future connections, especially those with large bandwidth requirements. This results in poor spectrum utilization as well as potentially high blocking probability in flex-grid optical networks. We propose a novel fragmentation-aware routing, wavelength and spectrum assignment (RWSA) scheme for flex-grid optical networks. The objective of this scheme is to prevent or curtail spectrum fragmentation, by compacting the occupation of spectrum resources in the network while allocating them to the incoming connections, using a metric defined in our study. Thereby, the scheme is aimed at reducing blocking probability leading to overall increased spectrum utilization of the network. In our work, we present a comparative study of the performance of the proposed RWSA scheme with that of the commonly employed first-fit based RWSA scheme for flex-grid optical networks, and demonstrate the improvement achieved under different traffic scenarios.	blocking (computing);erlang (unit);fiber-optic communication;fork (software development);fragmentation (computing);optical fiber;requirement;routing;usability	Ruman Dutta;S.

We distinguish control flows from data flows, and introduce a novel dynamic control plane architecture to distribute different control flows among multiple controller instances depending on specific controller load and controller processor utilization or on the data flow service type. We propose âcontrol flow tablesâ-a concept introduced in this paper-that are embedded in OpenFlow flow tables to distribute the control flows among various controller instances. Experimental results demonstrate the improvements in the data plane service performance as a result of the proposed control flow management procedures when the bottleneck is the controller CPU or throughput of links between the controller and switches.	bottleneck (software);central processing unit;cloud computing;comparison of raster-to-vector conversion software;control flow;control plane;dataflow;embedded system;end-to-end principle;forwarding plane;network switch;openflow;scalability;software-defined networking;systems architecture;throughput	Burak Gorkemli;Murat Parlakisik;Seyhan Civanlar;Aydin Ulas;A.

In this paper we investigate end-node driven fault diagnosis assuming that no support functions in the network exist.Fault diagnosis in networking systems spanning wired and wireless links is complicated as faults are hidden in the network and observations are unreliable. To overcome this, we show how Bayesian Networks (BNs) can be applied for probabilistic fault diagnosis.We model a TCP end-to-end connection to estimate the state of the network and diagnose faults in the wireless and wired domain respectively.Â Â Estimation accuracy and diagnosis reactivity performance is evaluated from simulations and compared to a simple threshold based approach. We show how multiple unreliable cross-layer observations improve BN diagnosis performance and robustness to changes in the environment. Furthermore, we evaluate the BN approach and methods to extract features from network traffic to suggest improvements.	causal filter;dynamic bayesian network;end-to-end principle;fault detection and isolation;file spanning;network packet;production rule representation;retransmission (data networks);router (computing);simulation;software diagnosis;telecommunications network;throughput;warez	Anders Nickelsen;Jesper GrÃ¸nbÃ¦k;Thibault Renier;Hans-Peter Schwefel	2009	2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/AINA.2009.66	support function;throughput;fault tolerance;real-time computing;uncertainty;feature extraction;bayesian probability;computer science;information security;probability;bayesian network;distributed computing;accuracy and precision;mobile computing;transport layer;wireless;statistics;robustness;computer network	Networks	-7.590784908576875	77.27378011920331	98964

9a5fa5e9c10dc40e20610795bad44e7e00391c1f	a fog-based internet of energy architecture for transactive energy management systems		Internet of Energy (IoE) is a subset of the Internet of Things which covers all aspects of electrical energy systems and provides secure connectivity and interoperability between power grid and Internet. In this paper, we present a fog-based IoE architecture for transactive energy (TE) management systems. The proposed design consists of three different layers. In the first tier, home gateways are employed which collect customers energy consumption data and provide necessary interface between customers and power grid. In the second layer, there are some local fog nodes located at the network edge and provide services with low latency. From the TE system point of view, the fog node act as retail energy market server which provides energy services to the end users. In the third layer, cloud servers are utilized to provide permanent and reliable data storage and high computing power. The proposed architecture supports different communication protocols such as hypertext transfer protocol, constrained application protocol, and OpenADR. We calculate the required bandwidth and delay performance of both fog- and cloud-based models.

Successful integration of multicast into the global Internet promises to bring similar benefits to group communications. In spite of this promise and massive research and experimentation with IP multicast, efforts to realize multicast services on the Internet have so far failed. A key element to facilitate IP multicast is to reduce the amount of infrastructure and network support specifically introduced for multicast. We have defined, implemented and experimented with a lightweight single source multicast paradigm for the Internet that self-configures over the unicast infrastructure using only elementary router functions. Our protocol avoids multicast specific control infrastructure. The only multicast specific functions are the control plane topology management, which operates out of data-path and manipulates router classifiers (forwarding table) and tunnel facilities.	control plane;correctness (computer science);information needs;internet;multicast address;net neutrality;nonlocal lagrangian;programming paradigm;router (computing);software deployment;unicast	GÃ­sli HjÃ¡lmtÃ½sson;BjÃ¶rn BrynjÃºlfsson;Ãlafur Ragnar Helgason	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (IEEE Cat.

Most of these schemes are based on packet marking (i.e., augmenting IP packets with partial path information). A major challenge to packet marking schemes is the limited space available in the IP header for marking purposes. In this paper, we focus on this issue and propose a topology based encoding schemes supported by real Internet measurements. In particular, we propose an idealized deterministic edge append scheme in which we assume that the IP header can be modified to include the marking option field of fixed size. Also, we propose a deterministic pipelined packet marking scheme that is backward compatible with IPv4 (i.e., no IP header modification). The validity of both schemes depends directly on the statistical information that we extract from large data sets that represent Internet maps. Our studies show that it is possible to encode an entire path using 52 bits	append;backward compatibility;denial-of-service attack;encode;ip address spoofing;ip traceback;internet;item unique identification;map;network packet;router (computing);software deployment	Basheer Al-Duwairi;Thomas Daniels	2004	Proceedings. 13th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (IEEE Cat.

SDN breaks the deadlock that has kept Internet network protocols stagnant for decades, while applications and physical links have evolved. This article advocates for the use of SDN to bring about 5G network services by incorporating network coding (NC) functionalities. The latter constitutes a major leap forward compared to the state-ofthe- art store and forward Internet paradigm. The inherent flexibility of both SDN and NC provides fertile ground to envision more efficient, robust, and secure networking designs, which may also incorporate content caching and storage, all of which are key challenges of the upcoming 5G networks. This article not only proposes the fundamentals of this intersection, but also supports it with key use cases and a thorough performance evaluation on an implementation that integrated the Kodo library (NC) into OpenFlow (SDN).

Moreover, many applications nowadays require multicast (one-to-many) connections. We propose a network model that has such a hierarchical architecture which is designed for multicast connections. We develop a multi-stage routing scheme which solves the routing problem in different levels of the network for multicast connections. The network model consists of three levels: collection, core and distribution networks. We adopt the lighttrail model in collection-distribution networks which is a convenient way to carry multicast connections. Connection points between the core and collection networks are the edge routers which groom several multicast connections destined to the same distribution network. We evaluate two call acceptance criteria, namely best effort and all-or-none corresponding to total or partial multicast service, respectively. We show using simulations that our multi-stage routing algorithm with light-trails and edgegrooming improves the performance in the hierarchical network model.	algorithm;best-effort delivery;blocking (computing);eisenstein's criterion;erlang (unit);hierarchical network model;multicast;one-to-many (data model);routing;simulation;tree network	Onur Turkcu;Suresh Subramaniam;Arun K.

The proposed mobile terminal framework is leading to high performance opportunities for multimedia services with high level of QoS provisioning and secure communications. It is using vertical multi-homing and multi-streaming features with IPSec encapsulations within the mobile equipments, which are able to handle simultaneously multiple radio network secure connections and speed up the transfer of the multimedia services by transmitting each object in a separate stream, achieving high level of QoS and security provisioning. Our proposed model is user-centric, targeted to always-on connectivity, maximal network throughput, with ability to provide various multimedia services with high level of security and confidentiality.

Being a PWC able to perform simultaneous wavelength conversions, it can be employed to replace many single-channel wavelength converters, thus saving in the number of expensive optical components. Recently a switching fabric employing FixedWavelength Converters (FWCs), providing relevant cost savings compared to previous proposals, has been presented. The drawback is that it requires a high number of FWCs. For this reason, here new solutions based on PWCs instead of FWCs for such an architecture are proposed. Resulting switching fabrics are compared in terms of loss performance and cost. Simulation results outline that fabrics based on PWCs allow to save devices while obtaining the same performance as architectures using FWCs. They also prove how cost benefits are obtained in many switch configurations.	analog-to-digital converter;network switch;optical switch;simulation;switched fabric;wavelength-division multiplexing	Michele Savi;Harald Ãverby;Norvald Stol;Carla Raffaelli	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503554	real-time computing;telecommunications	HPC	-7.033715672110583	86.22657190991106	99909

Different causes can motivate this inaccuracy, such as the state aggregation produced in hierarchical networks, the delay in flooding the network state, and the triggering policy used to determine when this network state information must be updated. This paper focuses on the inaccuracy caused by the triggering policies. Triggering policies are included in the routing protocol to reduce the large number of update messages needed to guarantee accurate network state information on all the network nodes. The BYPASS Based Optical Routing (BBOR) has already been proposed by the authors to reduce the effects of having inaccurate routing information in networks operating under the wavelength-continuity constraint. This paper extends the BBOR mechanism to be applied to wavelength convertible networks and evaluates its performance.

Rather than months, service contracts may span hours or minutes. Connectivity, however, is just one of many possible services. Providers will begin to offer network and application-level services targeted at improving the overall wireless experience of the user. Determining the best path through the various networks will require accurate information describing which services are being offered by each provider. In this paper, we model the process of propagating this information as an instance of a distributed, hierarchical cache. Access routers actively discover and collect information about the immediate network neighborhood on behalf of mobile nodes. Mobiles fill their own caches through queries to their local access routers, and then employ the cached information to make informed, intelligent handover decisions. Through simulation, we show that high cache hit rates at the mobile node can be achieved even when the discovery process at the access router is incomplete. In comparison to static and centralized approaches, our dynamic approach requires less configuration and maintenance, avoids single points of failure, and provides a scalable solution that spans administrative domains.	active networking;cpu cache;cache (computing);centralized computing;hotspot (wi-fi);inter-domain;internet;memory hierarchy;population;prototype;reliability engineering;replay attack;router (computing);runescape;scalability;server (computing);simulation;single point of failure;software deployment;wireless router	Robert C.

4d25fd0b65e70bc007d7da8ff111fcfd4f794292	simulated annealing algorithm for minimization of bandwidth fragmentation in elastic optical networks with multicast and unicast flows		The recently proposed idea of Elastic Optical Networks (EON) is expected to largely improve performance of optical networks in terms of resource utilization. However, the possibility to divide the optical spectrum into relatively narrow segments called slices in EONs triggers the problem of bandwidth fragmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel metaheuristic algorithm based on the Simulated Annealing approach to solve the Routing and Spectrum Assignment (RSA) problem with the objective function denoting the bandwidth fragmentation. It is assumed that two types of network flows are optimized, namely, multicast and unicast. Using two representative network topologies, we run extensive numerical experiments to tune the SA algorithm and verify its performance in various scenarios. The main conclusion is that the application of our SA algorithm can significantly improve the bandwidth fragmentation in EONs.	algorithm;fragmentation (computing);multicast;simulated annealing;unicast	Piotr Nagly;Krzysztof Walkowiak	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-24834-9_38	real-time computing;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-5.650398678165483	83.54826656074894	100278

As voice moves from its traditional separate network to having both user and trunk connections traverse the corporate IP network, the demands for uptime and quality of experience increase dramatically. When video-over-IP is layered onto the same infrastructure, the challenges become even greater as video and traditional data traffic can overload links and potentially degrade sensitive VoIP traffic. Furthermore, when all three services run over a single infrastructure, any failure can wipe out all communications. This paper addresses the challenge of how the newly converged network can be effectively deployed and managed for mission-critical, real-time services. We respond to this challenge by suggesting a model with the appropriate optimized planning, design, and further maintenance.	data erasure;internet protocol suite;mission critical;network convergence;real-time clock;traverse;uptime	Natalia Kryvinska;Christine Strauss;Peter Zinterhof	2009	2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium	10.1109/WTS.2009.5068985	real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Networks	-13.420150923848748	88.29296562916032	100295

dcbb5cede1a6fda949084a305edb94eac1851ff5	network restoration for next-generation communication and computing networks		Network failures are undesirable but inevitable occurrences for most modern communication and computing networks. A good network design must be robust enough to handle sudden failures, maintain traffic flow, and restore failed parts of the network within a permissible time frame, at the lowest cost achievable and with as little extra complexity in the network as possible. Emerging next-generation (xG) communication and computing networks such as fifth-generation networks, software-defined networks, and internet-of-things networks have promises of fast speeds, impressive data rates, and remarkable reliability. To achieve these promises, these complex and dynamic xG networks must be built with low failure possibilities, high network restoration capacity, and quick failure recovery capabilities. Hence, improved network restoration models have to be developed and incorporated in their design. In this paper, a comprehensive study on network restoration mechanisms that are being developed for addressing network failures in current and emerging xG networks is carried out. Open-ended problems are identified, while invaluable ideas for better adaptation of network restoration to evolving xG communication and computing paradigms are discussed.	circuit restoration	Babatunde S.

Converged IP next-generation networks (NGNs) will enable easier blending and personalization of those services. For popular content, technologies like caching, broadcasting, and multicasting aim to increase network efficiency but also introduce extra complexity and bandwidth overhead. Additionally, the sheer amount of available content and the increasing flexibility for the end user to request content at any time from any place make it increasingly difficult to determine content popularity in order to predict the efficiency of using content distribution techniques. This paper describes a model for wireless networks to use network characteristics and a prediction of the popularity distribution to calculate the optimal combination of unicast and broadcast techniques when offering a number of media channels to the end user. Furthermore, an approach is described to optimize personalized content distribution efficiency in converged IP NGN networks utilizing efficiency calculations with this model.	alpha compositing;cache (computing);digital distribution;internet protocol suite;multicast;next-generation network;overhead (computing);personalization;unicast	Sietse van der Gaast;Dennis J.

However, there exist many obstacles in applications of this technology. The problem of VN embedding is commonly considered the most difficult one of them. Most existing research only considers the case of how to embed VN request. Provided user demands on Virtual Network are dynamically changing, how to efficiently reconfigure VN to adapt to changing demand is challenging also. In this paper, our objective is to find way for optimally reorganize VN that already embedded on VN in a cost sensitive way to meet the changed demand. We address this problem by proposing a cost sensitive VN reconfiguration approach. A heuristic VN reconfiguration algorithm with virtual node and virtual link migration and swapping strategy is designed. We validate and evaluate the given algorithms by conducting experiments in high fidelity emulation environment. Our evaluation results show that the proposed approach can effectively reconfigure VN while minimizing cost and fragmentation of resource. By comparing our algorithms with others, the given reconfiguration algorithm outperforms existing solutions.	algorithm;embedded system;emulator;existential quantification;experiment;fragmentation (computing);heuristic;paging;token reconfiguration;virtual machine	Li Xu;Guozhen Tan;Xia Zhang	2014	2014 IEEE Computers, Communications and IT Applications Conference	10.1109/ComComAp.2014.7017194	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-11.382555177493643	81.6711169222744	100580
58ff1f208040573ed10d1a72fa13671b6601e21a	implementation of a virtual switch monitoring system using openflow on cloud		As a next generation networking protocol, OpenFlow enhances network performance by separating the control plane from data plane. It can be implemented for quality of service: users desiring network resources or with higher priorities defined by the system are allocated with adequate resources. Besides the communication protocol, another two elements are required to complete the OpenFlow system: the switch, either physical or virtual, which supports OpenFlow, and the controller, which sends setting packets to control the switch flow table. With OpenFlow, users are not restricted to functions provided by the specific switch, since by a standard application programming interface (API) users can define wanted functions instead of predefined ones bundled in operating systems. This paper aims to create an OpenFlow switch monitoring system, which oversees traffic pass through switches under the controller, and provides a convenient webpage for network administrators to modify flow priorities and effectively mana...	network function virtualization;openflow	Chao-Tung Yang;Jung-Chun Liu;Wei-Sheng Chen;Fang-Yie Leu;William C.

We present a perspective on such a redesign motivated primarily by cost considerations. We examine some tenets for the design of 4G wireless network architectures that are aimed at improving costs in various aspects of the network. One tenet is the maximization of economies of scale by partitioning the functionality among network elements in a way that maximizes the potential domain of applicability of the network elements. Another is reduction of the number of distinct types of network elements needed by flattening the levels of hierarchy in the execution of various functions. We explain our reasoning by illustrating a way of redesigning the current 3GPP network architecture based on these tenets.	expectationâmaximization algorithm;network architecture	Rajeev Agrawal;Anand S.

642a433f99a185ca188d7fc7bff5e1f043f4915c	configuration of network management for energy efficiency in optical transport networks using gmpls and obs techniques		The suboptimal distribution of the traffic load over the high-speed optical network channels results in poor overall channel utilization and leads to the increased energy consumption. This means that configuration of the network management system including traffic engineering protocols and traffic management mechanisms may have indirect but significant impact on the overall energy efficiency of the particular optical transport network setup. Therefore, we aim in this paper to estimate how energy efficiency of the optical transport network depends on the configuration of the management protocols and mechanisms deployed into the GMPLS and OBS technologies. In addition, we analyze particular configurations of specific mechanisms those allow to increase energy efficiency of the optical transport network without compromising the parameters of the quality of service (QoS).

The aim is to support trillion of things connect to the Internet. In NovaGenesis, we have presented a set of distributed systems where any information processing is seen as service. Services organize themselves based on names and agreements to meet semantics rich goals, policies, regulations, etc. Even networking functionalities are considered as services. Every existence could have one or more names: natural language names or self-certifying names. All the communication, processing, and storage are name-oriented. The protocol stacks are built on demand in a contract-based way. Hence, we can state that NovaGenesis architecture could be an alternative solution for current internet oriented innovations in a scalable manner. The aim of this architecture is the coverage of Internet and sensors oriented smart objects.

d63c87c7c5c62a6126cb881544f2707da2a70786	modeling cost of countermeasures in software defined networking-enabled energy delivery systems		Software defined networking (SDN) is a networking paradigm to provide automated network management at run time through network orchestration and virtualization. SDN is primarily used for quality of service (QoS) and automated response to network failures. In the context of Energy Delivery System (EDS), SDN can also enhance system resilience through recovery from failures and maintaining critical operations during cyber attacks. Researchers have proposed SDN based architectures for autonomous attack containment, which dynamically modifies access control rules based on configurable trust levels. One of the challenges with such architectures is the lack of a cost model to select the countermeasure which balances the trade-off between security risk and network QoS. Prior to choosing a particular countermeasure which either quarantines the attack or mitigates the impact, it is also critical to assess the impact on the ability of the operator to conduct normal operations. In this paper, we present an approach to aid in selection of security countermeasures dynamically in an SDN enabled EDS and achieving tradeoff between providing security and QoS. We present the modeling of security cost based on end-to-end packet delay and throughput. We propose a non-dominated sorting based multi-objective optimization framework which can be implemented within an SDN controller to address the joint problem of optimizing between security and QoS parameters by alleviating time complexity at $O(MN^{2})$. The $M$ is the number of objective functions and $N$ is the number of population for each generation respectively. We present simulation results which illustrate how data availability and data integrity can be achieved while maintaining QoS constraints.	access control;analysis of algorithms;autonomous robot;data integrity;electronic document system;end-to-end principle;extended data services;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;network packet;programming paradigm;quality of service;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;software-defined networking;sorting;telecommunications network;throughput;time complexity	Kamrul Hasan;Sachin Shetty;Amin Hassanzadeh;Malek Ben Salem;Jay Chen	2018	2018 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)	10.1109/CNS.2018.8433172	computer science;virtualization;network management;computer network;access control;quality of service;data integrity;software-defined networking;network packet;population	Security	-13.054422208194643	84.57244666942215	101040

It has previously been shown that latency can be approximated by assigning hosts coordinates in some geometric space such that the Euclidean distance between two hosts in this space is equivalent to latency, a method known as a Network Coordinate (NC) system. This is commonly achieved by a large scale distributed optimisation which seeks to minimise the error between latency and Euclidean distance. In this work we challenge the assumption of Euclidean space as a satisfactory model for embedding Internet-like networks, due to the curved nature of network distances. We present a novel distributed optimisation methodology: Non-Euclidean Internet Coordinates Embedding (NICE). NICE uses a polynomial regression model to explicitly learn the most effective distance function for latency estimation within a geometric space, in addition to a distributed non linear dimensionality reduction method. Dimensionality reduction is achieved via a variant of Landmark Multi Dimensional Scaling (LMDS) and a distributed optimisation algorithm. This allows the distributed system to create a set of coordinates for each of the participating hosts that can be used to accurately estimate latency. The system is implemented within the Java based PeerSim network simulator using both real and artificially generated input topologies and then compared to two of the most widely implemented NC systems: GNP and Vivaldi. By experimental simulation we show that NICE is significantly more accurate than either method while still remaining robust in the face of real network conditions.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;cluster analysis;coefficient;dimensionality reduction;distributed computing;euclidean distance;facility location problem;internet;java;mathematical optimization;multidimensional scaling;polynomial;simulation	Alexander Allan;Ross Humphrey;Giuseppe Di Fatta	2013	2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops	10.1109/ICDMW.2013.113	distributed algorithm;mathematical optimization;the internet;regression;multidimensional scaling;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;economic indicator;euclidean distance;mathematics;accuracy and precision;java;network topology;regression analysis;statistics;polynomial	Visualization	-11.530975517314362	76.8479215721906	101060
fdb0443dbd0efb952850283838efea6ec55f3cdc	a cache-aware social-based qos routing scheme in information centric networks		Abstract Due to the rapid expansion of Internet and the huge proliferation of users, Internet has evolved from a host-centric model to a content-oriented model. This implies the in-adaptation of current TCP/IP architecture providing the best performance to end-users and the urgency of researching future Internet architecture. In future Internet, the named data rather than traditional IP address may become the thin waist of the hourglass model of networking. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a cache-aware social-based Quality of Service (QoS) routing scheme for Named Data Networking (NDN) in Information Centric Network (ICN). Three kinds of social relationships, namely neighbors ( NB ), interest friends ( IF ) and response friends ( RF ) are devised to describe the relationships among nodes. Thus, when there is a failure in doing Pending Interest Table (PIT) scheme, a forwarding scheme based on social relationships is done before doing Forwarding Information Base (FIB) scheme. Moreover, a caching policy and its corresponding replacement policy based on content popularity, cache space and neighbor caching information are proposed. Results from simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed scheme has better performance, including a higher routing success ratio, than NDN routing mechanism.	cpu cache;quality of service;routing	Dapeng Qu;Xingwei Wang;Min Huang;Keqin Li;Sajal K.

Network resilience can be improved by adding new links to increase network connectivity and robustness. However, random link additions without an optimisation objective function can have insignificant connectivity improvement. In this paper, we develop a heuristic algorithm that optimises a network by adding links to achieve a higher network resilience by maximising algebraic connectivity and decreasing total cost via selecting cost-efficient links. We apply our algorithm to five different backbone topologies and measure algebraic connectivity improvement and the cost incurred while adding new links. For evaluation, we apply three centrality node attacks to the nonand optimised networks and show the network flow robustness while nodes are removed. Our results show that optimised graphs with higher algebraic connectivity values are mostly more resilient to centrality-based node attacks.	algebraic connectivity;algorithm;centrality;cost efficiency;flow network;heuristic (computer science);internet backbone;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem	Mohammed J.

b9ff77a9e8c22288d3ab6065ec53054f1f634239	virtualizing the edge of the cloud: the new frontier		Over the last two decades, virtualization technologies have turned datacenter infrastructure into multitenant, dynami- cally provisionable, elastic resource, and formed the basis for the wide adoption of cloud computing. Many of todays cloud applications, however, are based on continuous inter- actions with end users and their devices, and the trend is only expected to intensify with the expansion of the Internet of Things. The consequent bandwidth and latency require- ments of these emerging workloads push the cloud bound- ary outside of traditional datacenters, giving rise to an edge tier in the end-device-to-cloud-backend infrastructure. Com- putational resources embedded in anything from standalone microservers to WiFi routers and small cell access points, and their open APIs, present opportunities for deploying ap- plication logic and state closer to where it is being used, addressing both latency and backhaul bandwidth problems. This talk will look at the role that existing virtualization tech- nologies can play in providing in this edge tier the required flexibility, dynamic provisioning and isolation, and will out- line open problems that require development of new solu- tions. We will also discuss the opportunities to leverage these technologies to further deal with the diversity in the end-user device and IoT space.	backhaul (telecommunications);cloud computing;data center;embedded system;internet of things;multitenancy;multitier architecture;provisioning;wireless access point	Ada Gavrilovska	2016		10.1145/2892242.2892243	real-time computing;simulation;distributed computing	Metrics	-15.133789890615493	86.75760296318445	101507

The network is more flexible and adaptable, it can scale with traffic demands. To manage video traffic in the network, or get protection from cyber-attacks, Deep Packet Inspection is increasingly deployed at specific locations in the network. The virtual Deep Packet Inspection (vDPI) engines can be dynamically deployed as software on commodity servers within emerging NFV infrastructures. For a network operator, deploying a set of vDPIs over the network is a matter of finding the appropriate placement that meets the traffic management or cyber-security targets (such as the number of inspected flows) and operational cost constraints (license fees, network efficiency or power consumption). In this work, we formulate the vDPI placement problem as a cost minimization problem. The cost captures the different objectives the operator is pursuing. A placement of vDPIs on the network nodes realizes a trade-off between these possibly conflicting goals. We cast the problem as a multi-commodity flow problem and solve it as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). We then devise a centrality-based greedy algorithm and assess its validity by comparing it with the ILP optimal solution on a real data set (GEANT network with 22 nodes and real traffic matrix). We further analyze the scalability of the heuristic by applying it to larger random networks of up to 100 nodes. The results show the network structure and the costs strongly influence time performance. They also show that after a size limit (between 40 to 80 nodes in our case), the execution time increases exponentially due to combinatorial issues. Finally, they demonstrate that the heuristic well approximate the optimal on smaller problem instances.	network function virtualization	Mathieu Bouet;Jeremie Leguay;Vania Conan	2015		10.1109/NETSOFT.2015.7116121	traffic generation model;network traffic control;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;network simulation;distributed computing	EDA	-11.444987449154324	81.6443300827674	101636

I . BACKGROUND INTRODUCTION A. Next-Generation Optical WDMNetworks Fiber optics and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technology have significantly increased the transmissioncapacity of todayâs transport networks, andplayed an extremely important role to support the explosively increasedInternet traffic aswell aslarge amountof traditional traffic. Using WDM technology, the bandwidth of a fiber link canbedivided into tens(or hundreds)of non-overlappedwavelength channels (i.e., frequency channels), eachof which canoperate at thepeekelectronic proces ingrate, i.e.,over gigabits persecond. Thebandwidth of a wavelength channel canbefurtherdividedinto finer granularity trunk using Time-division multiplexing (TDM) techniqueandbe sharedby differentendusers. An endusercanbeany typeof client network equipmentssuchasIP, ATM or Framerelaynetwork equipment.Hence,optical WDM network have served as an important platform (a circuit core) to provide network connectivity as well as transmissioncapacity to todayâs Internet infrastructureandapplicationservice.

Most of the earlier work on reservation based media access protocols for single-hop optical networks has assumed the availability of state-of-the-art transmitters and/or receivers which are capable of tuning to the required wavelengths within nanoseconds. Their protocol operates in the region where the tuning times of the end-devices are of the same order of magnitude as the transmission time of a packet. In the basic MaTPi protocol, network throughput is improved by effectively overlapping the tuning duration of a transmitter in a node with the transmitting times of lasers in other nodes. They extend this basic protocol to the mult-MaTPi protocol, where each node has more than one transmitter to further improve the bandwidth efficiency of the network. Preliminary simulation results indicate that this practical protocol is indeed capable of achieving high throughput with low-cost, off-the-shelf components. A number of extensions to this protocol are also discussed. >	pipeline (computing);wavelength-division multiplexing	Srinivasan Tridandapani;James S. Meditch;Arun K.

To reduce the total cost of such a network, an efficient way is using the traffic grooming technique to minimize the number of add/drop multiplexers (ADMs) on the ring. Since traffic often changes frequently, the problem of supporting dynamic traffic patterns with minimum number of ADMs and wavelengths becomes incresingly important, which is referred to as grooming of dynamic traffic. In this paper, we will deal with rearrangeably nonblocking grooming of arbitrary dynamic traffic in such ring networks. We will discuss in detail the benefit of splitting methods to such a grooming way and apply them to this kind of grooming. A novel genetic algorithm (GA) approach with a hierarchical chromosome structure for each individual is proposed in combination with splitting methods to address such grooming problems. Computer simulation results under different conditions show that our algorithm is efficient in reducing both the numbers of ADMs and wavelengths.	computer simulation;genetic algorithm;multiplexer;non-blocking algorithm;nonblocking minimal spanning switch;search algorithm;software release life cycle;synchronous optical networking;token ring;wavelength-division multiplexing	Kun-hong Liu;Yong Xu	2005	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-005-2482-4	computer simulation;ring network;genetic algorithm;traffic grooming;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	-5.785975326095283	80.96639861530593	102241

This problem consists in finding the number of fibers between each pair of node, selecting the configuration of each node, choosing the set of lightpaths (i.e., the virtual topology), routing these lightpaths over the physical topology and finally, grooming and routing the traffic over the lightpaths. Since this problem is NP-hard, we propose heuristic algorithms and a tabu search metaheuristic algorithm to find good solutions for real-size instances rapidly.

7064ffb0c1c148d55afa49fc1938ef84bc594aa9	seamless handover in ip over icn networks: a coding approach		Seamless connectivity plays a key role in realizing QoS-based delivery in mobile networks. However, current handover mechanisms hinder the ability to meet this target, due to the high ratio of handover failures, packet loss and service interruption. These challenges are further magnified in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks (HCN) such as Advanced Long Term Evolution (LTE-Advanced) and LTE in unlicensed spectrum (LTE-LAA), due to the variation in handover requirements. Although mechanisms, such as Fast Handover for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PFMIPv6), attempt to tackle these issues; they come at a high cost with sub-optimal outcomes. This primarily stems from various limitations of existing IP core networks. In this paper we propose a novel handover solution for mobile networks, exploiting the advantages of a revolutionary IP over Information-Centric Networking (IP-over-ICN) architecture in supporting flexible service provisioning through anycast and multicast, combined with the advantages of random linear coding techniques in eliminating the need for retransmissions. Our solution allows coded traffic to be disseminated in a multicast fashion during handover phase from source directly to the destination(s), without the need for an intermediate anchor as in exiting solutions; thereby, overcoming packet loss and handover failures, while reducing overall delivery cost. We evaluate our approach with an analytical and simulation model showing significant cost reduction compared to PFMIPv6.	anycast;compaq lte;computer programming;data compression;denial-of-service attack;failure rate;icn gps;interrupt;linear code;mobile ip;multicast;network packet;provisioning;proxy mobile ipv6;proxy server;quality of service;rlc circuit;requirement;seamless3d;shortest path problem;simulation	Mohammed Al-Khalidi;Nikolaos Thomos;Martin J.

One of the goals of all discussed approaches is to reduce the interdomain traffic that causes high costs for ISPs. However, the focus of the work in this field is generally on the type of locality information that is provided to the overlay and on the entities that exchange this information. An aspect that is mostly neglected is how this information is used by the peers. In this paper, we consider the predominant approach of Biased Neighbor Selection and compare it with Biased Unchoking, which is an alternative locality aware peer selection strategy that we propose in this paper. We show that both mechanisms complement each other for the BitTorrent file sharing application and achieve the best performance when combined.	bittorrent;content delivery network;digital distribution;download;entity;exponent bias;file sharing;inter-domain;locality of reference;slashdot effect;swarm	Simon Oechsner;Frank Lehrieder;Tobias HoÃfeld;Florian Metzger;Konstantin Pussep;Dirk Staehle	2009	2009 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Peer-to-Peer Computing	10.1109/P2P.2009.5284527	the internet;bittorrent;computer science;peer-to-peer;database;internet privacy;inductor;world wide web;file sharing;network topology;bandwidth;server;computer network	DB	-14.752152818595258	76.05306140705817	102884

In this work we study the problem of computing optimal disjoint paths for providing shared protection in fully wavelength-convertible networks. We introduce and formalize the concept of dependent cost structure of a protection path on its working path and current network status. We formulate the problem of computing optimal disjoint paths for providing shared protection in fully wavelength-convertible networks as the problem of computing least-cost disjoint paths with dependent cost structure (LDP-DCS). We prove that LDP-DCS is NP-complete and is also hard to approximate. We present an iterative modified network-flow heuristic for the problem. We provide an approach to measure the optimality of the solution computed by the heuristic. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed heuristic in comparison to earlier heuristic approaches which did not consider the dependent cost structure.	approximation algorithm;fault tolerance;flow network;heuristic;iterative method;linked data platform;np-completeness;simulation;wavelength-division multiplexing	Ajay Kumar Todimala;Byrav Ramamurthy;N.

The key features of the proposed ring are optical transparency and statistical multiplexing of optical packets on parallel WDM channels. Such features can be exploited by properly allocating wavelengths and receivers. This paper aims to optimally dimension the unidirectional ECOFRAME rings. The dimensioning at minimum cost (i.e., for wavelengths and receivers) is modeled with an mixed-integer linear programming formulation. An heuristic algorithm is also proposed, and its performance is compared against the optimal solutions and bounds. When considering the receiver and wavelength cost, results indicate that trading the wavelengths for receivers allows cost saving of up to 75% with respect to WDM optical packet rings with a single dedicated wavelength per node (i.e., single receiver at each node).	algorithm;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;linear programming formulation;network packet;packet switching;receiver (information theory);wavelength-division multiplexing	Bogdan Uscumlic;Isabella Cerutti;Annie Gravey;Philippe Gravey;Dominique Barth;Michel Morvan;Piero Castoldi	2011	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-011-0325-z	telecommunications;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-5.955779155524212	83.8786494776355	103200

This work proposes a stub multihoming solution called Multi-Addressing with Stub Tunnels (MAST). By combining IPv6 multi-addressing with backup tunnels between a stub and each of its providers, stubs can enjoy the reliability advantages of multihoming without adding to the size of the GRT. An analysis of the current Internet BGP RIBs was conducted. It showed that the current global routing table size of 450K prefix entries would be reduced to about 24K entries if the MAST solution was adopted by all stubs.	backup;border gateway protocol;internet access;multihoming;multiple homing;router (computing);routing table;test stub;time complexity;vii	Jie Li;Malathi Veeraraghavan	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6883818	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;supernetwork;border gateway protocol;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;ip forwarding;routing protocol;multihoming;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;default-free zone;computer security;routing information protocol;computer network	HPC	-8.382612758081315	86.11741193784032	103412

In a second work by the same authors published in IEEE CAL, they propose to simplify the fat-tree to a unidirectional multistage interconnection network (UMIN), using the same load-balancing deterministic routing algorithm. They show that comparable performance figures are achieved with much lower network complexity. In this comment we show that the proposed load-balancing deterministic routing is in fact the routing scheme used by the butterfly network. Moreover we show that the properties of the simplified UMIN network proposed by them are intrinsic to the standard butterfly and other existing UMINs.	algorithm;artificial neural network;cal;deterministic routing;fat tree;file allocation table;load balancing (computing);multistage amplifier;multistage interconnection networks;resultant	Elisardo Antelo	2009	IEEE Computer Architecture Letters	10.1109/L-CA.2009.6	routing table;routing domain;routing;static routing;parallel computing;adaptive routing;network packet;dsrflow;equal-cost multi-path routing;network switch;resource allocation;computer science;dynamic source routing;load balancing;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;bismuth;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;helium;triangular routing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;network topology;routing information protocol;computer network	Arch	-5.171925553318927	86.49936571087376	103515

For network connections that span multiple administrative domains, network operators have to reach agreements on reservation requirements. As a result, a network reservation request may take from days to weeks to be provisioned. To improve provisioning times and the success rate of multidomain network reservations, we designed and implemented an application-aware orchestration framework for multidomain R&E networks. This framework leverages latest developments in software-defined networking to automate network provisioning in order to democratize access to network reservation through novel APIs. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of our application-aware orchestration framework. We evaluate our system using Mininet and demonstrate that it provisions 49% more reservations than current state-of-the-art systems within seconds of receiving a request.	end-to-end principle;experiment;provisioning;quality of service;requirement;software-defined networking	JoaquÃ­n Chung;Rajkumar Kettimuthu;Nageswara S.

81845686c6901f6e99c4d6bb5f71c16ec4a363ab	an experimental approach to examine a multi-channel multi-hop wireless backbone network		This paper presents an experimental deployment of a multi-channel multi-hop wireless backbone network (WBN) with an OpenFlow-based traffic management method. Specifically, a set of APs, each of which uses a single but different channel, is connected by Ethernet and thus constructs a Virtual AP (VAP), thereby achieving a WBN with multiple channels. To flexibly control traffic flows transmitted over a multi-channel multi-hop WBN, we propose a simple traffic management method based on the OpenFlow control. In the performance evaluation, we first conduct a preliminary experiment as a lab scale and then deploy a 6-hop WBN enabling to provide the Internet access service in a conference (from proof-of-concept to a practical environment). Since the control messages are inherently transmitted with the introduction of OpenFlow, the way of isolation between control plane and data plane will become a critical issue to actually deploy the proposed system for the Internet service. We additionally employ a wireless control network for the conference experiment. The experimental results show that the proposed WBN can increase the network capacity in accordance with the number of channels, thereby providing significant throughput performance for various applications.	control plane;experiment;forwarding plane;hop;internet access;internet backbone;openflow;performance evaluation;scalability;serial experiments lain;software deployment;testbed;throughput;transmitter	Yuzo Taenaka;Masaki Tagawa;Kazuya Tsukamoto	2015	Informatica (Slovenia)		telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-12.27958701240035	85.09279997678944	103839

Their sustainable development however is severely hindered by the intrinsic limit of their client/server architecture. A shift to the peer-to-peer paradigm has been widely suggested with success already shown in live video streaming and movie-on-demand. Unfortunately, our latest measurement demonstrates that short video clips exhibit drastically different statistics, which would simply render these existing solutions suboptimal, if not entirely inapplicable.  Our long-term measurement over five million YouTube videos, on the other hand, reveals interesting social networks with strong correlation among the videos, thus opening new opportunities to explore. In this article, we present NetTube, a novel peer-to-peer assisted delivering framework that explores the user interest correlation for short video sharing. We address a series of key design issues to realize the system, including a bi-layer overlay, an efficient indexing scheme, a delay-aware scheduling mechanism, and a prefetching strategy leveraging interest correlation. We evaluate NetTube through both simulations and prototype experiments, which show that it greatly reduces the server workload, improves the playback quality and scales well.	cpu cache;clientâserver model;experiment;peer-to-peer;programming paradigm;prototype;rich internet application;scheduling (computing);server (computing);simulation;social network;socialization;streaming media;video clip	Xu Cheng;Jiangchuan Liu	2012	TOMCCAP	10.1145/2071396.2071401	computer science;operating system;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;sustainable development;clientâserver model;computer network;social network	Networks	-17.122618725676773	75.86841359580085	104083

However, they often suffer from high cost of construction and management. The data-intensive workloads motivate modern data centers to utilize higher-bandwidth networks like 10 Gb Ethernet (10 GbE). Traditional wired data centers, suffering from complex wiring and management, can not always satisfy this requirement. Wireless data centers have some advantages such as economical installing and no worry about wiring. This paper proposes a new completely wireless data center, which has good performance and high fault tolerance to the network failures. We propose a novel data center design including intra-rack and inter-rack architectures. Especially, inter-rack data transmission can be finished by one hop when we transmit data via the ceiling. Data center, built with this methodology, is significantly convenient to be deployed and managed, which avoids the complex wiring and too much material cost. Extensive simulations have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposal. Our novel design of wireless data center outperforms Cayley data center on bandwidth and good fault tolerance as well as reducing hotspot in the network.	data center	Yawei Zhao;Honghui Chen;Jia Xu;Hanlin Tan;Tao Chen	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-46826-5_3	embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	ML	-11.304864134234888	80.32560958012562	104139

These algorithms can be used in arbitrarily connected networks and with some simple modifications, they can also be applied on various networking scenarios. We have evaluated our algorithms through extensive simulations. The simulations are carried out in two parts: static traffic and dynamic traffic. The results will demonstrate that our RWA algorithm performs better than other previously proposed algorithms (in the cases we studied).	algorithm;artificial intelligence;assignment problem;blocking (computing);cluster analysis;robustness (computer science);routing and wavelength assignment;simulation	Zhemin Ding;Mounir Hamdi	2002		10.1109/ICC.2002.997372	telecommunications;computer science;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network	EDA	-4.896642817609533	82.06184176439861	104219
41c270f92cb84dfa23dfa2719e5a2bd8503f1840	an intelligent honeynet architecture based on software defined security		Honeynet is deployed to trap attackers and learn their behavior patterns and motivations. Conventional honeynet is implemented by dedicated hardware and software. It suffers from inflexibility, high CAPEX and OPEX. There have been several virtualized honeynet architectures to solve those problems. But they lack a standard operating environment and common architecture for dynamic scheduling and adaptive resource allocation. Software Defined Security (SDS) framework has a centralized control mechanism and intelligent decision making ability for different security functions. In this paper, we present a new intelligent honeynet architecture based on SDS framework. It implements security functions over Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI). Under uniform and intelligent control, security functional modules can be dynamically deployed and collaborated to complete different tasks. It migrates resources according to the workloads of each honeypot and power off unused modules.

It provides on-demand dedicated high-bandwidth channels for large data transfers, and also high-resolution high-precision channels for fine control operations. In the initial deployment its data plane consists of several thousand miles of dual 10 Gb/s lambdas. The channels are provisioned on demand using layer 1 and 2 switches in the backbone and multiple service provisioning platforms at the edges in a flexible configuration using a secure control plane. A centralized scheduler is employed to compute future channel allocations, and a signaling daemon is used to generate the configuration signals to switches at appropriate times. The control plane is implemented using an out-of-band virtual private network, which encrypts the switching signals, and also provides authenticated user and application access. Transport experiments are conducted on a smaller test connection that provides us useful information about the basic properties and issues of utilizing dedicated channels in applications.	authentication;centralized computing;control plane;daemon (computing);experiment;forwarding plane;gigabyte;image resolution;internet backbone;lambda calculus;network switch;out-of-band agreement;provisioning;scheduling (computing);software deployment;testbed;virtual private network	Nageswara S.

A number of proposals tried to address the problem by provisioning different classes of services with different protection schemes. However, most of these works are applied to a single layer and lack cross layer coordination in multilayer scenarios. In addition, there is an increasing need for supporting services with very high resilience requirements over future communications networks. This, however, has to be done in a cost efficient manner and without over-engineering the network. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that simplifies the whole design and achieves both high resilience and differentiation. Our approach, utilizes the spine concept idea of embedding a subnetwork at the physical layer with comparatively high availability link and node values [1]. This lays a foundation for differentiation between multiple classes of flows. Then, cross layer mapping and spine-aware routing are performed in a way that transfers this differentiation capability to the upper layer network and flows. We provide two joint routing-mapping optimization formulations and evaluate their performance in a multilayer scenario.	cost efficiency;differentiated services;high availability;mathematical optimization;provisioning;requirement;routing;subnetwork;telecommunications network	Abdulaziz Alashaikh;David Tipper;Teresa Gomes	2016	2016 12th International Conference on the Design of Reliable Communication Networks (DRCN)	10.1109/DRCN.2016.7470832	reliability engineering;routing;network architecture;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;service layer;network layer;psychological resilience;computer network	Mobile	-8.897337054980989	84.4879164977466	104534

Given a set of QoS multicast requests, we are to find a set of cost suboptimal QoS routing trees and assign wavelengths to them. The objective is to minimize the number of wavelengths in the system. This is a challenging issue. It involves not only optimal QoS multicast routing, but also the optimal wavelength assignment. Existing methods consider channel setup in WDM networks in two separate steps: routing and wavelength assignment, which has limited power in minimizing the number of wavelengths. In this paper, we propose a new optimization method, which integrates routing and wavelength assignment in optimization of wavelengths. Two optimization algorithms are also proposed in minimizing the number of wavelengths. One algorithm minimizes the number of wavelengths through reducing the maximal link load in the system; while the other does it by trying to free out the least used wavelengths. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can produce suboptimal QoS routing trees and substantially save the number of wavelengths.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;maximal set;multicast;quality of service;routing and wavelength assignment;simulation;wavelength-division multiplexing	Xiaohua Jia;Dingzhu Du;Xiao-Dong Hu;Man-Kei Lee;Jun Gu	2001	IEEE Trans.

Since existing networks provide limited support for middleboxes, administrators typically overload path selection mechanisms to coerce traffic through the desired sequences of middleboxes placed on the network path. These ad-hoc practices result in a data center network that is hard to configure and maintain, wastes middlebox resources, and cannot guarantee middlebox traversal under network churn.  To address these issues, we propose the policy-aware switching layer or PLayer, a new layer-2 for data centers consisting of inter-connected policy-aware switches or pswitches. Unmodified middleboxes are placed off the network path by plugging them into pswitches. Based on policies specified by administrators, pswitches explicitly forward different types of traffic through different sequences of middleboxes. Experiments using our prototype software pswitches suggest that the PLayer is flexible, uses middleboxes efficiently, and guarantees correct middlebox traversal under churn.	data center;firewall (computing);hoc (programming language);indirection;middlebox;network switch;network topology;prototype;software prototyping;testbed;url redirection	Dilip Antony Joseph;Arsalan Tavakoli;Ion Stoica	2008		10.1145/1402958.1402966	data link layer;data center;real-time computing;computer science;load balancing;operating system;distributed computing;indirection;computer security;computer network	Networks	-14.709249813666439	81.86138938365218	104583

6157bddb7ec7fb974d745cb85f4d751c06d8ce60	an efficient resource management scheme based on locality for p2p overlay network		In a mobile environment, there are limitations: limited power supply, smaller user interface, limited computing power, limited bandwidth and limited storage space; and above limitations must be considered for deploying a p2p overlay network. Locality and mobility are important factors as well as the limitations in a mobile environment. Based on the above assumption, we propose a mobile locality-based hierarchical p2p overlay network (MLH-Net) to address locality problems without any other services. In this paper, we introduce a novel profile called PCSN-List and node management scheme. MLH-Net is constructed as two layers, an upper layer formed with super-nodes and a lower layer formed with normal-nodes. Because super-nodes can share advertisements, we can guarantee physical locality utilization between a requestor and a target during any discovery process. To overcome a node failure, we propose a simple recovery mechanism. The simulation results demonstrate that the hop value of MLH-Net is 21 % decreased compared with JXTA when discovering nodes. And also, the average distance is decreased by 45 % as the number of max-hop is increased.

8d4c8d42b8f76be359e058a99b477d54e9cd5d1b	hybrid virtual network embedding algorithm with k-core decomposition using path splitting		Network virtualization is an efficient approach of solving the ossification problem of the Internet. It has become a promising way of supporting lots of heterogeneous network onto substrate physical network. A major challenge in network virtualization is how to map multiple virtual networks onto specific nodes and links in the shared substrate network, known as virtual network embedding problem. Due to its NPhardness, many heuristic approaches have been proposed. In this thesis, we propose hybrid VN embedding algorithms that map multiple VN requests with node and link constraints with K-core decomposition using path splitting. Based on network pruning, a virtual network is decomposed to core network and edge network. The mapping process is divided into two phases: core network mapping and edge network mapping. Path splitting enables better resource utilization by allowing the substrate to accept more VN requests. It splits the available bandwidth of the path into small bandwidth to satisfy the resource constraints. The proposed algorithm improves the performance of the algorithm by splitting the path into small bandwidth. Due to path splitting proposed algorithm will accept many virtual network requests that will increase the revenue and acceptance ratio of the algorithm.	algorithm;heuristic;internet;network mapping	Neha Mishra	2014	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;distributed computing	HPC	-8.564505642266056	82.56625825546169	105134

A significant reason for this prolific deployment is the relatively simple manner in which they can be configured and deployed. A critical service on these networks, that epitomises the simple nature of Ethernet, is the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). This protocol is used to determine the link-layer address of a host given its network-layer identifier, and uses the intrinsic broadcast capability of Ethernet to determine these mappings. In this paper, we present an analysis of ARP behaviour on three sizable local area networks and show that due to poorly configured or malicious software (e.g. viruses) on hosts, performance issues could arise because of ARP. We also propose a scheme that can be used to manage the effect of the problems identified in our analysis.	computer virus;identifier;malware;scheme;software deployment	D.

Furthermore, specialization of network operations, the de-regulation of vertically integrated network operators, new demands from end users, as well as new business models for Over-The-Top players, give rise to new challenges and emphasizes that networking becomes ever more dynamic and organic in nature. To address these trends the research community has been investigating how to integrate management capabilities into the networks in order to meet the foremost requirements on reduced OPEX, but also to enable faster responses to agile business operations for the support of new value chains, applications, and services. These management capabilities are however envisaged as an add-on to the existing functionality. This would impose scalability, performance, and extensibility issues when such capabilities are deployed incrementally and ad-hoc. In this paper, we give an overview of selected recent advances in network architectures supporting self-management capabilities, and identify both their strengths and their limitations. This analysis provides input for a definition of the requirements and core properties for networks to become inherently self-managed. We then outline a generic model termed the âNetcellâ that seeks to support the identified requirements and core properties.	add-ons for firefox;agile software development;design by contract;extensibility;foremost;hoc (programming language);internetworking;partial template specialization;recursion;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);runtime system;scalability;self-management (computer science)	Martin Johnsson;Brendan Jennings;Dmitri Botvich	2011	12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops	10.1109/INM.2011.5990566	simulation;network architecture;computer science;architecture;management science;computer security;computer network	Networks	-15.714943560304063	84.8843861744855	105429

25f014b2d90bb5eab7cf41a8576251ca2007d18a	jasper: joint optimization of scaling, placement, and routing of virtual network services		To adapt to continuously changing workloads in networks, components of the running network services may need to be replicated (scaling the network service) and allocated to physical resources (placement) dynamically, also necessitating dynamic re-routing of flows between service components. In this paper, we propose joint optimization of scaling, placement, and routing (JASPER), a fully automated approach to jointly optimizing scaling, placement, and routing for complex network services, consisting of multiple (virtualized) components. JASPER handles multiple network services that share the same substrate network; services can be dynamically added or removed and dynamic workload changes are handled. Our approach lets service designers specify their services on a high level of abstraction using service templates. JASPER automatically makes scaling, placement and routing decisions, enabling quick reaction to changes. We formalize the problem, analyze its complexity, and develop two algorithms to solve it. Extensive empirical results show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.	algorithm;complex network;complexity;high-level programming language;image scaling;mathematical optimization;place and route;replication (computing);routing	Sevil Dr&#x00E4;xler;Holger Karl;Zolt&#x00E1;n &#x00C1;d&#x00E1;m Mann	2018	IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management	10.1109/TNSM.2018.2846572	workload;network service;network functions virtualization;computer science;complex network;distributed computing;cloud computing;scaling;virtual network;server	Networks	-11.817209102267618	81.69089002830724	105721

Many previous studies proposed dedicated protection architectures to protect the critical components, which results in high cost for deployment. To achieve high reliability and low-cost for deployment, this article proposes a novel fault-tolerant Multi-EPON system with cost-effective shared protection through Bridge ONUs. Under failures, the Bridge ONU controls the faulty EPON, plays the role of OLT and the transmission of faulty EPONs are restored by relaying to other interconnected adjacent EPONs. The minimum hop-count relay algorithm and the relay window mechanism are also proposed for the Multi-EPON system to efficiently help data relaying to the central office (CO). Furthermore, the one-wait dynamic bandwidth allocation enables the controller of affected Passive Optical Networks (PONs) to obtain more up-to-date buffer information from each ONU in order to enhance overall system performance. The simulation results show that the proposed Multi-EPON system can provide high system performance for different failure situations in terms of throughput, average delay, maximum delay, and expedited forwarding (EF) jitter, especially in high traffic loads.	access network;algorithm;commitment ordering;computer science;entity framework;ethernet in the first mile;fault tolerance;halting problem;network packet;optical line termination;passive optical network;relay;scalability;simulation;software deployment;telephone exchange;throughput	I-Shyan Hwang;Zen-Der Shyu;Liang-Yu Ke	2008	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-008-0167-5	passive optical network;fault tolerance;real-time computing;cost-effectiveness analysis;telecommunications;computer science;optical line termination;computer performance;10g-epon;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	HPC	-8.28489604033523	85.00599011684615	105761
c180ccfe4843abcd7583ac316e023e5de463a1c3	a quasi-realistic internet graph		The existence of a realistic Internet interconnections model has been an important requirement to effectively support areas as routing optimization, routing security, and services QoS prediction. However, no usable and no useful models exist. The existing interconnection models are to (i) simplistic to be applicable in real scenarios, or (ii) incorporate to much uncorrelated information that cannot be used due to its complexity. This work presents the construction steps and final solution for a quasi-realist graph that models the Internet as an all. The graph is based on all known Internet exchange points (IX) and landing points of all known submarine cables. The lack of information about interconnections between IX and landing points is extrapolated from simple rules that take in consideration Earth geographic characteristics. This approach results in a graph that includes all major corner stones of the Internet while maintaining a simple structure. This graph can then be used to predict connectivity and routing properties between any two geographical points in Earth. The proof-of-concept results, even with very simplistic assumptions as similar node and link loads and symmetric routing by the shortest path, show that the model allows the prediction of the round-trip time of traffic and number of nodes between any two Internet points with an acceptable average error.	extrapolation;interconnection;internet;mathematical optimization;routing;shortest path problem	Paulo Salvador	2017		10.5220/0006440100270032	the internet;graph (abstract data type);distributed computing;graph;computer science	Theory	-10.285683803726322	78.35659224317696	105928

As opposed to the case of static popularity, in this case for the network resources to be efficiently allocated the replication should vary with time. In this study, we first outline the low-level operations of wireless networks with caching, which involve decisions of combinatorial complexity, such as about the contents of all network caches. To overcome this complexity, we approximate the network optimization with a formulation based on the frequency of file replication across the network - a high-level perspective, amenable to mathematical analysis. We present a solution that is based on looking ahead into the future and has a simple graphical representation.	approximation algorithm;cache (computing);flow network;graphical user interface;high- and low-level;mathematical optimization	Savvas Gitzenis;Stavros Toumpis;Leandros Tassiulas	2014	10th International Conference on Heterogeneous Networking for Quality, Reliability, Security and Robustness	10.4108/icst.qshine.2014.256567	real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	HPC	-9.662185835672052	77.32202489642371	106082
33bec82d9cdd0fa7c415c43abec60685fe890c87	towards traffic classification offloading to stateful sdn data planes		Traffic classification allows network operators to gain important insights to better characterize packet flows, enabling fundamental applications such as traffic engineering, network analytics and Quality of Service (QoS) enforcing. A common approach adopted for flow classification is based on Deep Packet Inspection (DPI): all the traffic is processed by a middlebox whose task is the association of a network flow to the application-level information by inspecting the entire content of the packets. The increased volume of encrypted traffic limits the type of analysis performed by network middleboxes. However, an important amount of information can still be extracted from packets belonging to the very initial phase of a connection which are transmitted in clear (e.g. DNS and TLS handshake). Furthermore, recent research work has shown that it is possible to reduce the burden on the DPI without a significant loss in classification accuracy, by limiting the amount of data processed per flow. In this paper, we propose to exploit the programmability of new stateful SDN data planes to offload down to the network the process of filtering traffic to the DPI. We show that it is jointly possible to reduce the required computing power of the DPI, as well as the network bandwidth between the switches and the DPI. By taking advantage of the flexibility of stateful data planes we also manage to delegate to switches the computation of useful network analytics metrics (such as number of packets, number of bytes and duration) which would otherwise require the DPI to inspect the entire traffic flow.	business logic;byte;computation;deep packet inspection;encryption;flow network;middlebox;network packet;network science;network switch;numerical analysis;open prosthetics project;quality of service;software-defined networking;state (computer science);stateful firewall;traffic classification;transport layer security	Davide Sanvito;Daniele Moro;Antonio Capone	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Network Softwarization (NetSoft)	10.1109/NETSOFT.2017.8004227	quality of service;traffic classification;computer network;deep packet inspection;stateful firewall;real-time computing;flow network;network packet;middlebox;network traffic control;computer science	Networks	-14.3455652059089	81.58932418801159	106201

As an answer to this challenge the networking community developed a wealth of piecemeal SDN troubleshooting tools aiming to track down misconfigurations or bugs of a specific nature (e.g. in a given SDN layer). In this demonstration we present EPOXIDE, an Emacs based modular framework, which can effectively combine existing network and software troubleshooting tools in a single platform and defines a possible way of integrated SDN troubleshooting.	firmware;prototype;software bug;software-defined networking;emacs	TamÃ¡s LÃ©vai;IstvÃ¡n Pelle;Felician NÃ©meth;AndrÃ¡s GulyÃ¡s	2015		10.1145/2785956.2790027	embedded system;computer science;operating system;software-defined networking;debugging;world wide web	Networks	-17.4869272387635	83.62399499613942	106314

Signals are subject to well-known physical impairments which are sensitive not only to the network topology, such as amplifier noise, but also to new impairments which vary with the network utilization. These impairments are interchannel crosstalk due to nonlinear signals combinations within the fiber links, and node crosstalk due to optical leaks inside the network nodes. As a result, calls in all-optical networks may be rejected because they do not meet a minimal QoS constraint which has to be enforced to ensure nearly errorfree network operation. Recently, Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) algorithms that account for network physical impairments have been developed. Some of them use FEC coding to trade, when needed, bandwidth utilization against higher QoS. RWA with optional FEC coding has been studied only for noise-limited networks. We show how RWA algorithms with optional FEC coding can be employed to reduce both static and dynamic physical impairments. We show that RWA algorithms with optional FEC coding are efficient to decrease call blocking probabilities, and also improve resource allocation fairness, in the context of a realistic continental-sized network.	algorithm;amplifier;blocking (computing);crosstalk;fairness measure;forward error correction;kÃ¶ppen climate classification;network topology;nonlinear system;passive optical network;quality of service;routing and wavelength assignment;wavelength-division multiplexing	Yvan Pointurier;MaÃ¯tÃ© Brandt-Pearce;Bo Xu	2006			coding (social sciences);distributed computing;computer network;computer science;crosstalk;network topology;routing and wavelength assignment;wavelength-division multiplexing;resource allocation	Theory	-7.681796478661522	83.46625209852994	106512

However, it is challenging to design such a platform to host multiple heterogenous and often highly customized virtual networks. Not only high degree of flexibility is desired for virtual networks to customize their functions, fast packet forwarding is also required. This paper presents PdP, a flexible network virtualization platform capable of achieving high speed packet forwarding. A PdP node has multiple machines to perform packet processing for virtual networks hosted in the system. To forward packets in high speed, the data plane of a virtual network in PdP can be allocated with multiple forwarding machines to process packet in parallel. Furthermore, a virtual network in PdP has the freedom to be fully customized. Both the control plane and the data plane of the virtual network run in virtual machines so as to be isolated from other virtual networks. We have built a proof-of-concept prototyping PdP platform using off-the-shelf commodity hardware and open source software. The performance evaluation results show that our system can closely match the best-known packet forwarding speed of software router running in commodity hardware.	commodity computing;control plane;forwarding plane;network packet;open-source software;parallel computing;performance evaluation;programmed data processor;router (computing);virtual machine	Yong Liao;Dong Yin;Lixin Gao	2011	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2010.07.027	embedded system;full virtualization;real-time computing;computer science;virtual machine;operating system;hardware virtualization;packet forwarding;virtual circuit;packet switch;proof of concept;computer network	Networks	-14.650293505266609	80.4407093360272	106671

Given the significant improvements in efficiency evident in the technology embodied in the 3G, 4G and beyond technologies, is the economics underlying the operation of the 2G infrastructure still viable? Would the operators be better off phasing out these legacy systems or could these continue to be the cash cows they have been all along these years, especially amidst the emerging breed of applications - the Machine to Machine (M2M) paradigm? This article examines the above issue quantitatively from an economic standpoint considering the UK market as an example and relies on data gathered by Office of Communications (OFCOM), the regulator in the UK. Findings from this study strongly suggest that re-purposing the legacy infrastructure for M2M services could pave the way to creating promising revenue streams for the operators.	communications of the acm;legacy system;machine to machine;programming paradigm	Parag Kulkarni;Raul Martinez Oviedo	2014	Proceeding of IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks 2014	10.1109/WoWMoM.2014.6918929	simulation;computer network	Arch	-15.194358669655601	88.03022596047715	106717

2556cb2bb873787ca600d97f8a91d72700a86f77	handover initiation comparison in virtualised sdn-based flow mobility management		This paper presents a framework that integrates Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) to migrate operational aspects of both the networkâs Points of Attachment (PoA) and Mobile Nodes (MN) into the cloud. The SDN Controller is used as an enhanced mobility management entity by integrating the capability to instantiate in the cloud a virtual representation of the MNs (vMN). These vMNs not only act as anchors for the handover process of the physical MNs, but also act as proxies for the delivery of context information about the physical MNs wireless surroundings. Such information can be further used by the Controller for optimised handover decisions, resulting in a technology-agnostic flow mobility management mechanism for heterogeneous networks. A video delivery scenario was selected for evaluation in an experimental testbed, where the video is offloaded between wireless networks towards a dual-interfaced MN, considering different handover initiation procedures. With a handover delay of about 60ms, the results shown that virtualising the end-points reduces 67% of the OpenFlow signalling in the physical network, while as a trade-off, the OpenFlow control communication packet size and delay of the MN are incremented.	attachments;cloud computing;database trigger;downstream (software development);entity;network function virtualization;network packet;openflow;proxy server;software-defined networking;testbed;throughput	Flavio Meneses;Carlos GuimarÃ£es;Daniel Corujo;Rui L.

It therefore becomes critical for Mobile Nodes to determine semi-independently the most appropriate technology and Access Network for a given scenario. This supports both the dynamic selection of the 'best' point of attachment and near-seamless handoff. Several solutions have already been proposed both within standards bodies and the wider academic community. Our aim is to define an intelligent network selection mechanism, capable of representing and enforcing explicit user-defined parameters as part of a host-based handoff mechanism. Moreover, our proposal works both independently and in cooperation with network-based handoff mechanisms.	access network;attachments;intelligent network;network model;next-generation network;seamless3d;semiconductor industry	Michael Mackay;Jose Moura;Christopher Edwards	2008	Seventh International Conference on Networking (icn 2008)	10.1109/ICN.2008.106	intelligent network;next-generation network;telecommunications;computer science;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Robotics	-13.830404353190318	88.33196641053333	107188

To this end, we propose a novel agent-based migration model considering these factors. Based on the model, we analyze the case study of optimal path computation with joint migration to two emerging networking paradigms, i.e., IETF Path Computation Element (PCE) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Our results demonstrate the synergistic effects of migration to multiple complementary technologies, and shows that a technology migration may be eased by the joint migration to multiple technologies.	agent-based model;computation;emoticon;layer (electronics);simulation;software-defined networking;sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation;synergy	Tamal Das;Marek Drogon;Admela Jukan;Marco Hoffmann	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6654924	simulation;computer science;multi-agent system;computer security;computer network	HPC	-9.052587245976607	83.85252106459723	107350

A multicast request is most efficiently provisioned through the creation of a tree, with the endpoints, or resources, occasionally serving as branching points. This practice can lead to the source of the request becoming disconnected from the associated resources should one of those branching resources fail. In cases where a large amount of data are currently in transmission, the ramifications of this failure can be severe. We propose an optimal solution through integer linear programming for the static protected multicast routing and wavelength assignment problem, where an entire set of requests is provisioned with built-in redundancy against single resource node failure. We compare the optimal performance against several heuristics and find that protection against this type of failure can be provided with the trade-off of increased wavelength consumption, compared to less-protected solutions.	assignment problem;blocking (computing);built-in self-test;canonical account;clustered file system;dynamic problem (algorithms);heuristic (computer science);integer programming;linear programming;multicast;multipoint ground;point-to-multipoint communication;programming paradigm;provisioning;routing and wavelength assignment;simulation;statistical model;streaming media;time complexity;transmitter;wavelength-division multiplexing	Dylan A.

Link reinforcement through protection techniques is effective in providing robustness against link failure, but cannot be applied on every link due to resource limitations. This letter proposes a preventive start-time link-weight optimization scheme with link reinforcement considering all possible single-link failure scenarios. When the upper bound of the manageable congestion ratio is given, our proposed scheme determines a suitable link weight set at the network operation start that minimizes the number of links to reinforce, specifying the reinforced links, so as to guarantee a congestion ratio lower than or equal to the manageable congestion ratio upper bound under any single-link failure scenario. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	mathematical optimization;network congestion	Stephane Kaptchouang;Ihsen Aziz OuÃ©draogo;Eiji Oki	2014	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2325814	link state packet;telecommunications;computer network	Embedded	-7.076676207074499	82.01595768115531	107401

Unfortunately, these connections are also the components that, when properly installed, can reduce testbed costs by attaching multiple nodes per gateway. After illustrating how unreliable current solutions can become (regardless of the used sensor nodes, USB cabling, or gateway setup), a set of experiments led to a list of dos and don'ts in testbed deployment. Furthermore, a simple and cost-effective suggestion is presented that allows to bypass current USB backchannel issues, leading to a more robust testbed that avoids manual maintenance of individual nodes.	backchannel;booting;experiment;job stream;reboot (computing);sensor node;server (computing);software deployment;testbed;usb;usb hub	Pablo Ezequiel Guerrero;Iliya Gurov;Alejandro P.

However, in such a scenario, even a single failure in the substrate can cause large disruptions as it will affect all the VIs mapped onto it. Thus, the problem of guaranteeing survivability and reliability of VI is important, and even more complex than in single layer networks. In this paper, we study the reliable VI mapping problem that enables efficient resource sharing by using the cross sharing scheme that reuses the primary bandwidth for backup VI links. In addition, we also study the sharing of backup resources across multiple different VI requests. We first formulate the reliable VI mapping problem as a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem to minimize the VI mapping cost. We then present our reliable VI mapping (RVIM) algorithm for efficient bandwidth sharing using the cross and backup sharing schemes. Finally, we present the VI combination (ComVI) algorithm to generate shared backup VI nodes and links for multiple VI requests in a cost efficient manner. Through simulation we show that our RVIM algorithm can reduce the mapping costs when compared to other VI mapping algorithms, and backup resource sharing using ComVI can reduce the total mapping cost efficiently.

In this architecture, virtual working and spare capacities needed for call allocation and restoration are reserved and released dynamically on a call-by-call basis at the time of call admission and termination. The architecture does not require advance assignment of spare and working capacities. To shorten the call processing delay, this is done in a parallel-distributed fashion. To provide restorable call allocation, parallel-distributed call processing algorithms of the sender-chooser type are suggested. The algorithms integrate on the call level virtual bandwidth allocation, virtual spare capacity assignment with fixed, alternate, or state-dependent routing. Each routing scheme leads to a particular tradeoff between call processing complexity, call setup delay, and bandwidth efficiency. For each pair of nodes, two sets of VPs are provisioned. The first is a working VP (WVP) set, to be used for call allocation during the normal operation. The second is a spare VP (SVP) set, to be used for VP restoration in the event of failure of network elements (NE). Each SVP protects a preassigned subset of the node pair WVPs. Each SVP is selected to be link/node disjoint from the WVPs that it is assigned to protect. This assures protection of the WVP set by a small number of SVPs. Since SVPs are preset and appropriate virtual spare capacities are reserved in advance, the architecture guarantees full restorability and provides very fast restoration. The restoration is done on the VP level in a self-healing manner. The suggested architecture requires only local information to be maintained at each node.	atm turbo;circuit restoration	Alexander Gersht;Alexander Shulman	1997		10.1109/ICC.1997.594973	parallel processing;routing;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;architecture;asynchronous transfer mode;normal operator;network topology;bandwidth;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Theory	-7.7106909299272575	83.24663863157257	107813

However, existing content-based protocols for static networks will incur unaffordable maintenance costs if they are applied directly to the highly mobile environment that is featured in disruption-tolerant networks (DTNs). In this paper, we propose a unique publish/subscribe scheme that utilizes the long-term social network properties, which are observed in many DTNs, to facilitate content-based services in DTNs. We distributively construct communities based on the neighboring relationships from nodes' encounter histories. Brokers are deployed to bridge the communities, and they adopt a locally prioritized pub/sub scheme which combines the structural importance with subscription interests, to decide what events they should collect, store, and propagate. Different trade-offs for content-based service can be achieved by tuning the closeness threshold in community formation or by adjusting the broker-to-broker communication scheme. Extensive real-trace and synthetic-trace driven simulation results are presented to support the effectiveness of our scheme.	centrality;clique (graph theory);delay-tolerant networking;denial-of-service attack;publishâsubscribe pattern;schema (genetic algorithms);simulation;social network;software propagation;synthetic intelligence	Feng Li;Jie Wu	2009	2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	10.1109/ICDCS.2009.28	social network analysis;index term;adaptive routing;computer science;operating system;middleware;database;distributed computing;publishâsubscribe pattern;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;computer network;social network	DB	-10.632909186094592	75.32281466192632	107817

Originally, these transport services assumed the use of VLANs and spanning tree protocols within provider bridge (PB) and provider backbone bridge (PBB) networks. Because the existing spanning tree protocols (STP, RSTP, and MSTP) were deemed inadequate for carrier networks, very recently, a new class of shortest path routing solutions have been introduced that avoid the use of spanning tree protocols in the core namely, shortest path bridging (SPB) and shortest path backbone bridging (SPBB). As a proof of concept, this paper aims at illustrating that we can still use spanning trees in carrier Ethernets provided that the tree generation and VLAN-spanning-tree mapping are performed adequately. We call our solution smart spanning tree bridging (SSTB). SSTB can be used to enhance the 802.1s MSTP, without requiring significant changes in the current Ethernet equipment. Using very simple but yet realistic numerical examples, we show that SSTB yield near optimal bandwidth and link usage. We also show that SSTB outperform SPB in terms of service delivery, frame loss and jitter, while being comparable in terms of bandwidth usage and latency.	bridging (networking);file spanning;ieee 802.1aq;itil;internet backbone;numerical analysis;parallel building blocks;plug and play;routing;shortest path problem;spanning tree protocol;terms of service;treemapping;virtual lan	Aref Meddeb	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.331	local area network;communications protocol;spanning tree;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;service delivery framework;distributed computing;routing protocol;shortest path problem;proof of concept;bandwidth;spanning tree protocol;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Networks	-9.53498939538509	85.42591534097397	108292
1265bd23962c0e0232d120a0cb2635b34a414bc5	optimization of ip networks in various hybrid igp/mpls routing schemes	interior gateway protocol;genetic algorithm	This paper presents an offline traffic engineering (TE) approach in several hybrid IGP/MPLS environments. Though IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) routing has proven its scalability and reliability, effective traffic engineering has been difficult to achieve in public IP networks because of the limited functional capabilities of conventional IP technologies. MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) on one hand enhances the possibility to engineer traffic on IP networks by allowing explicit routes, but on the other hand it suffers from the scalability problem. Hybrid IGP/MPLS approaches rely on IP native routing as much as possible and use MPLS only if necessary. In this work we propose a novel hybrid traffic engineering method based on genetic algorithms and investigate it in several IGP/MPLS routing schemes. This can be considered as an offline TE approach to handle long or medium-term traffic variations. In our approach the maximum number of hops as well as the maximum delay an LSP (Label Switched Path) may take and the maximum number of LSPs that can be installed in the network are treated as constraints.

Since a great part of core network operators' revenues comes from the provisioned connectivity services, in this work we study the value expected to generate by optical networks when provisioning differentiated services in Shared Path Protection (SPP) environments. In this regard, two wavelength partitioning schemes are compared: the shared (sh-WS) and the differentiated (diff-WS). The benefits of both schemes are evaluated from an economic perspective defining costs and revenues models and using Net Present Value (NPV). We define the Optical Network NPV Optimization (OVALO) problem as a NPV maximization problem. To solve OVALO, a linearized version of NPV is proposed as objective function of the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model and an iterative algorithm is used to finally solve OVALO. The partitioning schemes are numerically compared on two network topologies. From the results, we show that diff-WS maximizes resource utilization in the network without significantly increasing network costs, thus maximizing the network's value.	algorithm;diff utility;differentiated service;differentiated services;entropy maximization;integer programming;internet backbone;iterative method;linear approximation;linear function;linear programming;loss function;mathematical optimization;network topology;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;path protection;provisioning;self-propelled particles;wavelength-division multiplexing	Marc Ruiz;Luis Velasco;Jaume Comellas;Gabriel Junyent	2011	2011 8th International Workshop on the Design of Reliable Communication Networks (DRCN)	10.1109/DRCN.2011.6076883	mathematical optimization;integer programming;telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;optical fiber;distributed computing;iterative method;computer network	Metrics	-8.827613868437425	83.83382161884055	108876

However, it is costly for fat-tree DCNs to support nonblocking multicast communication, due to the large number of core switches required. Since multicast is an essential communication pattern in many cloud services and nonblocking multicast communication can ensure the high performance of such services, reducing the cost of nonblocking multicast fat-tree DCNs is very important. On the other hand, server redundancy is ubiquitous in today's data centers to provide high availability of services. In this paper, we explore server redundancy in data centers to reduce the cost of nonblocking multicast fat-tree data center networks (DCNs). First, we present a multirate network model that accurately describes the communication environment of the fat-tree DCNs. Then, we show that the sufficient number of core switches for nonblocking multicast communication under the multirate model can be significantly reduced in arbitrary 2-redundant fat-tree DCNs, i.e., each server has exactly one redundant backup in the data center. We generalize the result to practical fat-tree DCNs where servers may have different number of redundant backups depending on the availability requirements of services they provide, and show that a higher redundancy level further reduces the cost of nonblocking multicast fat-tree DCNs. Finally, we propose a multicast routing algorithm with linear time complexity to configure multicast connections in fat-tree DCNs.	backup;cloud computing;data center;dynamic circuit network;fat tree;file allocation table;high availability;multicast;network model;network switch;network topology;non-blocking algorithm;requirement;routing;server (computing);time complexity	Zhiyang Guo;Yuanyuan Yang	2012	2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium	10.1109/IPDPS.2012.96	data modeling;availability;routing;real-time computing;multicast;cloud computing;protocol independent multicast;computer science;operating system;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;redundancy;source-specific multicast;computational complexity theory;ubiquitous computing;bandwidth;xcast;server;computer network	Networks	-11.629259348408507	80.62351258647548	108921

In the authors approach, arbitrary performance objectives are defined in the form of cost functions, which map the queueing delay experienced by each packet to a cost incurred. The algorithms, cost-based scheduling (CBS) and cost-based dropping (CBD), then attempt to optimize network performance as perceived by the applications by minimizing the total cost incurred by all packets. Cost functions are presented that are appropriate for the most common applications. Scheduling and dropping algorithms are defined based on these cost functions. It is demonstrated that network performance is better when these heuristic algorithms are used as opposed to the common alternatives. The relative importance of scheduling and dropping is also considered. >	algorithm;integrated services;scheduling (computing)	Jon M. Peha;Fouad A.

af235736c97e505567fc4389ec0951cb4ba85d42	detecting cellular middleboxes using passive measurement techniques		The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) follows the endto-end principle â when a client establishes a connection with a server, the connection is only shared by two physical machines, the client and the server. In current cellular networks, a myriad of middleboxes disregard this end-to-end principle to enable network operators to deploy services such as content caching, compression, and protocol optimization to improve end-to-end network performance. If server operators remain unaware of such middleboxes, TCP connections may not be optimized specifically for middleboxes and instead are optimized for mobile devices. We argue that without costly active measurement, it remains challenging for server operators to reliably detect the presence of connection terminating proxies (CTPs). In this paper, we present three techniques (based on latency, loss, and characteristics of TCP SYN packets) for server operators to passively identify CTPs in cellular networks, with the goal to optimize TCP connections for faster content delivery. Using TCP and HTTP logs recorded by CDN servers, we demonstrate that our techniques are both reliable and accurate in detecting CTPs deployed in cellular networks worldwide.	content delivery network;digital distribution;divergence (computer science);end-to-end principle;hypertext transfer protocol;mathematical optimization;middlebox;mobile device;network performance;newman's lemma;proxy server;sensor;server (computing)	Utkarsh Goel;Moritz Steiner;Mike P.

We investigate the power and cost efficiency of all-optical and electrical technologies to understand the design principle for petabit-scale hybrid optical switch nodes for optical packet and burst switching. In order to achieve an efficient hybrid design, we point out the interesting observation that the use of long packets switched by passive-medium photonic switches can substantially reduce power consumption and system cost. For contention resolution, shared electronic memory buffers are more effective and power efficient than fiber delay line buffers. An empirical optimization exhibits that a traditional all-optical solution is not the best choice for power and cost efficiency. Using passive-medium photonic switches with electronic memory buffers, we can introduce a substantial savings in power and cost, approximately half of those of commercially available optical cross-connect systems, with a packet loss rate as low as 10-6.	analog delay line;cost efficiency;digital cross connect system;internet;mathematical optimization;network packet;network switch;optical cross-connect;optical switch;packet switching;passive optical network;petabit;semiconductor memory;shared memory	June-Koo Kevin Rhee;Chan-Kyun Lee;Jihwan Kim;Yong-Hyub Won;JinSeek Choi;JungYul Choi	2011	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2011.5762805	telecommunications;computer science;optical fiber;optical switch;computer network	Networks	-7.381569175908273	85.91724810436233	109584

Source address has always been ignored during routing. Lost of source address makes the traditional routing system inflexible and inefficient. The current network can not satisfy demands of both the network users and the ISP operators. Although many patch-like solutions have been proposed to bring the source address back to the routing system, the underlying problems of the traditional routing system can not be solved thoroughly. In this paper, we propose Two Dimension-IP Routing (TwoD-IP), which makes forwarding decisions based on both source and destination addresses. However, combining with source address, both the forwarding table and routing protocol have to be re-designed. To overcome the scalability problem, we devise a new forwarding table structure, which achieves wire-speed forwarding and consumes less TCAM storage space. To satisfy demands of users and ISPs, we also design a simple TwoD-IP policy routing protocol. At last, we discuss the deployment problem of TwoD-IP.	ip (complexity);routing;scalability;software deployment;telecommunications access method	Mingwei Xu;Shu Yang;Dan Wang;Jianping Wu	2013	2013 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.12720/jcm.8.4.249-258	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;supernetwork;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;routing information protocol	Networks	-8.127294196361287	81.10712642339634	109832
1b87096d74b57ea16b38ec14a603d13410918753	survivability analysis on non-triconnected optical networks under dual-link failures		Survivability of optical networks is considered among the most critical problems that telecommunications operators need to solve at a reasonable cost. Survivability can be enhanced by increasing the amount of network links and its spare capacity, nevertheless this deploys more resources on the network that will be used only under failure scenarios. In other words, these spare resources do not generate any direct profit to network operators as they are reserved to route only disrupted traffic. In particular, the case of dual link failures on fiber optic cables (i.e., fiber cuts) has recently received much attention as repairing these cables typically requires much time, which then increases the probability of a second failure on another link of the network. In this context, survivability schemes can be used to recover the network from a dual link failure scenario. In this work, we analyze the case of protection and restoration schemes, which are two well-known recovery strategies. The former is simpler to implement as it considers a fixed set of backup paths for all failure scenarios; however, it cannot take into account the spare capacity released by disrupted connections. Instead, the latter computes the best recovery path considering not only the spare capacity but also the released one due to failures. Achieving 100% survivability (i.e., recovery from all possible dual link failures) requires a triconnected network, where three disjoint paths for each connection are required. Since these networks can become extremely expensive since they can require a huge number of network links (i.e., fibers connections), a more realistic case of non-triconnected networks is assumed. In these networks, full network recovery is not be feasible, but achieving the maximum possible survivability is desired. Spare capacity can then be allocated to existing network links, which represents the actual cost of the survivability. We propose optimization models that take into account these different recovery strategies, and demonstrate that restoration has the potential to provide a much better recovery capability with almost the same amount of spare capacity required in protection schemes.	backup;centralized computing;circuit restoration;digital visual interface;fault tolerance;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;network topology;optical fiber cable;optical mesh network	Nehuen Gonzalez-Montoro;Jorge M.

This paper introduces our work on wireless access load balancing, being part of the UMF work. First of all, we summarize our approach (Distributed Decision Engine - DDE) for information monitoring, further processing and delivery in the context of autonomic network and service management. We describe our proof-of-concept prototype on multiaccess capable access selection and load balancing, and show the employment of DDE and autonomic decision mechanisms therein. The prototype is evaluated by conducting a set of measurements and outperformance will be proven against a reference system without network or service awareness.	autonomic computing;autonomic networking;decision support system;download;dynamic data exchange;load balancing (computing);prototype;reinforcement learning;simulation;telecommunications network;wireless access point	Teemu Rautio;Markus Luoto;Jukka MÃ¤kelÃ¤;Petteri Mannersalo	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6554771	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-17.911570909581258	84.71226616846631	110059

There is the need for novel middleware supports, aware of innovative context information, to select and dynamically re-configure the most suitable interfaces and connectivity providers for each client application. In particular, novel middlewares should effectively exploit concise and lightweight context indicators about expected node mobility, path throughput, and energy availability to take proper connectivity management decisions at session startup and to promptly re-configure them with limited overhead at runtime. Here, we present how our MMHC middleware originally uses mobility/throughput/energy context to manage connectivity opportunities effectively, i) by filtering out connectivity opportunities that are considered insufficiently reliable, and ii) by carefully evaluating the residual candidates in two distinguished local/global management phases to achieve the most suitable tradeoff between promptness and management costs.	bluetooth;client (computing);middleware;multihoming;multiple homing;overhead (computing);personal digital assistant;run time (program lifecycle phase);throughput	Paolo Bellavista;Antonio Corradi;Carlo Giannelli	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-87785-1_7	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;middleware;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-16.72406574183885	77.67117411287755	110084

85389c54465b7785df01469d618189d8de993623	self-corrective dynamic networks via decentralized reverse computations		The feasibility of large-scale decentralized networks for local computations, as an alternative to big data systems that are often privacy-intrusive, expensive and serve exclusively corporate interests, is usually questioned by network dynamics such as node leaves, failures and rejoins in the network. This is especially the case when decentralized computations performed in a network, such as the estimation of aggregation functions, e.g. summation, are linked to the actual nodes connected in the network, for instance, counting the sum using input values from only connected nodes. Reverse computations are required to maintain a high aggregation accuracy when nodes leave or fail. This paper introduces an autonomic agent-based model for highly dynamic self-corrective networks using decentralized reverse computations. The model is generic and equips the nodes with the capability to disseminate connectivity status updates in the network. Highly resilient agents to the dynamic network migrate to remote nodes and orchestrate reverse computations for each node leave or failure. In contrast to related work, no other computational resources or redundancy are introduced. The self-corrective model is experimentally evaluated using real-world data from a smart grid pilot project under highly dynamic network adjustments that correspond to catastrophic events with up to 50% of the nodes leaving the network. The model is highly agile and modular and is applied to the large-scale decentralized aggregation network of DIAS, the Dynamic Intelligent Aggregation Service, without major structural changes in its design and operations. Results confirm the outstanding improvement in the aggregation accuracy when self-corrective actions are employed with a minimal increase in communication overhead.	agent-based model;aggregate function;agile software development;autonomic computing;autonomic networking;big data;computation;computational resource;data system;experiment;object composition;overhead (computing);redundancy (engineering);reversing: secrets of reverse engineering	Evangelos Pournaras;Jovan Nikolic	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC)	10.1109/ICAC.2017.30	redundancy (engineering);real-time computing;smart grid;autonomic agent;dynamic network analysis;data modeling;computer science;distributed computing;computer network;network formation;network dynamics;dissemination	HPC	-18.82202480999667	81.07225588966594	110179

Internet-scale applications like Facebook and YouTube are served by large CDNs like Akamai and Google CDN, which push content as close to end-users as possible to improve the overall performance of the applications, minimize the effects of peering point congestion and enhance the user experience. The load is balanced among multiple servers or caches according to non-disclosed CDN internal policies. As such, adopting space and time variant policies, users' requests are served from different physical locations at different time. Cache selection and load balancing policies can have a relevant impact on the traffic routed by the underlying transport network, as well as on the end-user experience. In this paper, we analyze the provisioning of two major Internet applications, namely Facebook and YouTube, in two datasets collected at major European Internet Service Providers (ISPs). First, we show how the cache selection performed by Akamai might result in higher transport costs for the ISP. Second, we present evidence on large-scale outages occurring in the Facebook traffic distribution. Finally, we characterize the variation of YouTube cache selection strategies and their impact on the users' quality of experience. We argue that it is important for the ISP to rapidly and automatically detect such events. Therefore, we present an Anomaly Detection (AD) system for detecting unexpected cache-selection events and changes in the traffic delivered by CDNs. The proposed algorithm improves over traditional AD approaches by analyzing the complete probability distribution of the monitored features, providing higher visibility and better detection capabilities.	algorithm;anomaly detection;cpu cache;content delivery network;digital distribution;internet;load balancing (computing);network congestion;network traffic control;peering;provisioning;routing;sensor;user experience	Pierdomenico Fiadino;Alessandro D'Alconzo;Arian BÃ¤r;Alessandro Finamore;Pedro Casas	2014	2014 26th International Teletraffic Congress (ITC)	10.1109/ITC.2014.6932930	embedded system;the internet;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;server;measurement;computer network	Metrics	-17.308845912216505	75.61176477334368	110276

With the promise of SDN to simplify the deployment of alternative network architectures, the question arises how SDN and ICN could concretely be combined, deployed and tested. In this paper, we address this very question within a particular architectural context for ICN. We outline a possible realization in a novel design for ICN solutions and point to possible test bed deployments for future testing.	blueprint;icn gps;identifier;prototype;real life;software deployment;software-defined networking;testbed;wrapper function	Dimitris Syrivelis;George Parisis;Dirk Trossen;Paris Flegkas;Vasilis Sourlas;Thanasis Korakis;Leandros Tassiulas	2012	2012 European Workshop on Software Defined Networking	10.1109/EWSDN.2012.20	computer science;distributed computing;world wide web;computer network	Networks	-16.17167405741312	84.93896958791996	110306

We study the Domain Name System (DNS) service, used to convert host names to IP addresses, which has historically been provided by a client's Internet Service Provider (ISP). With the advent of cloud-based DNS providers such as Google and OpenDNS, clients are increasingly using these DNS systems for URL and other name resolution. Performance degradation with cloud-based DNS has been reported, especially when accessing content hosted on highly distributed CDNs like Akamai. In this work, we investigate this problem in depth using Akamai as the content provider and Google DNS as the cloud-based DNS system. We demonstrate that the problem is rooted in the disparity between the number and location of servers of the two providers, and develop a new technique for geolocating data centers of cloud providers. Additionally, we explore the design space of methods for cloud-based DNS systems to be effective. Client-side, cloud-side, and hybrid approaches are presented and compared, with the goal of achieving the best client-perceived performance. Our work yields valuable insight into Akamai's DNS system, revealing previously unknown features.	binocular disparity;cpu cache;client-side;cloud computing;data center;diskless node;dynamic web page;elegant degradation;google data centers;google public dns;internet;perceived performance;simulation;sparse matrix	Ravish Khosla;Sonia Fahmy;Y.

Cache technologies are considered as the most favorable tools for dealing with the problems of wireless traffic flow, having attracted tremendous interest from both the engineering and academic fields. However, most of the algorithms and tools developed are essentially based on descriptive models instead of predictive models, which are not capable of processing content traffic in the optimal way for wireless users with strong social characteristics. In this paper, a novel social relation based cache distribution policy is proposed, by which not only interaction among network users is used to detect the influential users among them, but also inherent friend relationships are used to predict desirable contents. These features are utilized to assist cache distribution among caching servers in advance for the purpose of serving the future needs of wireless mobile users.

A DC typically houses a large number of computing and storage nodes, interconnected by a specially designed network, namely, DC network (DCN). The DCN serves as a communication backbone and plays a pivotal role in optimizing DC operations. However, compared to the traditional network, the unique requirements in the DCN, for example, large scale, vast application diversity, high power density, and high reliability, pose significant challenges to its infrastructure and operations. We have observed from the premium publication venues (e.g., journals and system conferences) that increasing research efforts are being devoted to optimize the design and operations of the DCN. In this paper, we aim to present a systematic taxonomy and survey of recent research efforts on the DCN. Specifically, we propose to classify these research efforts into two areas: 1) DCN infrastructure and 2) DCN operations. For the former aspect, we review and compare the list of transmission technologies and network topologies used or proposed in the DCN infrastructure. For the latter aspect, we summarize the existing traffic control techniques in the DCN operations, and survey optimization methods to achieve diverse operational objectives, including high network utilization, fair bandwidth sharing, low service latency, low energy consumption, high resiliency, and etc., for efficient DC operations. We finally conclude this survey by envisioning a few open research opportunities in DCN infrastructure and operations.	data center;dynamic circuit network;internet backbone;mathematical optimization;network topology;open research;requirement;systematic review;taxonomy (general);time complexity;web service	Wenfeng Xia;Peng Zhao;Yonggang Wen;Haiyong Xie	2017	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/COMST.2016.2626784	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;optical switch;computer security;network topology;bandwidth;wireless;server;computer network	Networks	-12.846964404153097	86.7879709398092	110634

The service was designed taking advantage of features provided by the MPLS technology and also using the DiffServ architecture. So, it uses L2 MPLS VPNs to provide point to point connection and also marks the traffic in order to pass from certain priority queues (to provide guaranteed bandwidth). It also enables traffic engineering characteristics in order to provide load balancing on the network as well as fast rerouting in case of link failure. In addition we implemented a management tool for the service. The scope of this tool is to allow the users to manage their MBS requests (make a new one, edit, delete or view a request). Also the tool performs admission control and produces the necessary configuration that must be applied on the network in order to implement every service's request. This service was designed and implemented on GRNET's network.	differentiated services;internet backbone;load balancing (computing);multiprotocol label switching;priority queue;virtual private network	Christos Bouras;Dimitris Primpas	2005	2005 Systems Communications (ICW'05, ICHSN'05, ICMCS'05, SENET'05)	10.1109/ICW.2005.51	real-time computing;engineering;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-18.933786383289288	84.44585580196	110749

One such functionality is positioning, which is a sought-after service especially for mobile network operators as location-based services is a massive market opportunity. To reach the goal of having the infrastructure ready for positioning services by 2020, this article tries to raise the awareness of the main technology and standardization gaps. One such gap concerns accurate and precise time synchronization, as one of the best telecom-based positioning technologies requires the mobile base stations to be synchronized to nanoseconds relative to each other. On top of that, the evolution of LTE and 5G will introduce a broad portfolio of new technology trends and concepts that will have a significant impact on the overall mobile network architecture and therefore will affect the traditional positioning concepts as well. Hence, the focus of this article is further extended to new technology trends that are directly related to the positioning functionality and are planned for broad deployment in the near future, or widely recognized to be essential for 5G, such as massive MIMO (mMIMO), mmWave, and dense small cell deployment.	compaq lte;global positioning system;location-based service;mimo;network architecture;next-generation network;software deployment	Zdenek Chaloupka	2017	IEEE Communications Standards	10.1109/MCOMSTD.2017.1601030ST	intelligent network;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;hybrid positioning system;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	-14.349085405475448	88.26051940036962	110756
2d84ab547086bd2bba45da439595313ec5797da1	identifying and analyzing high impact routing events with pathminer	boolean tensor factorization;interdomain routing;bgp	Understanding the dynamics of the interdomain routing system is challenging. One reason is that a single routing or policy change can have far reaching and complex effects. Connecting observed behavior with its underlying causes is made even more difficult by the amount of noise in the BGP system. In this paper we address these challenges by presenting PathMiner, a system to extract large scale routing events from background noise and identify the AS or link responsible for the event.  PathMiner is distinguished from previous work in its ability to identify and analyze large-scale events that may re-occur many times over long timescales. The central idea behind PathMiner is that although a routing change at one AS may induce large-scale, complex responses in other ASes, the correlation among those responses (in space and time) helps to isolate the relevant set of responses from background noise, and makes the cause much easier to identify. Hence, PathMiner has two components: an algorithm for mining large scale coordinated changes from routing tables, and an algorithm for identifying the network element (AS or link) responsible for the set of coordinated changes.  We describe the implementation and validation of PathMiner. We show that it is scalable, being able to extract significant events from multiple years of routing data at a daily granularity. Finally, using PathMiner we study interdomain routing over past 9 years and use it to characterize the presence of large scale routing events and to identify the responsible network elements.	alex snoeren;algorithm;border gateway protocol;doraemon;file spanning;heuristic;inter-domain;internet;missing data;routing table;scalability;undo	Giovanni Comarela;Mark Crovella	2014		10.1145/2663716.2663754	static routing;real-time computing;simulation;border gateway protocol;computer science;multipath routing;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-10.95111170033113	78.13732295825395	110784
405833ac8ee91f9079f0586a90b3db4b0edffa6f	virtualized icn (vicn): towards a unified network virtualization framework for icn experimentation		To assess the feasibility and potential for deployment of new networking paradigms such as ICN, being able to carry out large scale experimentation and tests in real operational networks is crucial. Various platforms have been developed by the research community to support design and evaluation of specific aspects of ICN architecture. Most of them provide ICN-dedicated, small scale or application-specific environments and ad-hoc testing tools, non reusable in other contexts nor in real-world IP deployments.  The goal of this paper is to contribute vICN (virtualized ICN), a unified open-source framework for network configuration and management that uses recent progresses in resource isolation and virtualization techniques. It offers a single, flexible and scalable platform to serve different purposes, ranging from reproducible large-scale research experimentation, to demonstrations with emulated and/or physical devices and network resources and to real deployments of ICN in existing IP networks. In the paper, we describe the rationale for vICN and its components, highlighting programmability, scalability and reliability as its core principles. Illustration of vICN properties is provided through concrete examples.	ad hoc testing;carrier grade;configuration management;design rationale;emulator;hoc (programming language);icn gps;internet protocol suite;linux;mathematical optimization;modular design;network function virtualization;open-source software;scalability;simulation;software deployment;software-defined networking;unified framework	Mauro Sardara;Luca Muscariello;Jordan AugÃ©;Marcel Enguehard;Alberto Compagno;Giovanna Carofiglio	2017		10.1145/3125719.3125726	scalability;computer network;architecture;computer science;virtualization;software deployment;network virtualization;distributed computing;resource (disambiguation);ranging	Networks	-16.573539413829252	85.06134727638296	110840

However, it has not received adequate attention in commercial routers mainly due to the additional hardware complexity, and the perceived cost and performance degradation that may result from this complexity. These concerns can be mitigated if one can design a cost-effective router that can support adaptive routing. This paper proposes a three step recipe â Look-Ahead routing, intelligent Path Selection, and an Economic Storage implementation, called the LAPSES approach â for cost-effective high performance pipelined adaptive router design. The first step, look-ahead routing, reduces a pipeline stage in the router by making table lookup and arbitration concurrent. Next, three new traffic-sensitive path selection heuristics (LRU, LFU and MAX-CREDIT) are proposed to select one of the available alternate paths. Finally, two techniques for reducing routing table size of the adaptive router are presented. These are called meta-table routing and economical storage. The proposed economical storage needs a routing table with only 9 and 27 entries for two and three dimensional meshes, respectively. All these design ideas are evaluated on a ( 16 16) mesh network via simulation. A fully adaptive algorithm and various traffic patterns are used to examine the performance benefits. Performance results show that the look-ahead design as well as the path selection heuristics boost network performance, while the economical storage approach turns out to be an ideal choice in comparison to full-table and meta-table options. We believe the router resulting from these three design enhancements can make adaptive routing a viable choice for interconnects.	adaptive algorithm;elegant degradation;heuristic (computer science);least frequently used;lookup table;max;mesh networking;network performance;router (computing);routing table;simulation;speaker wire	Aniruddha S.

7dfdc5dcee076d2be08a7b944e2cdf046e42b26e	future trends and challenges for mobile and convergent networks		Some traffic characteristics like real-time, location-based, and community-inspired, as well as the exponential increase on the data traffic in mobile networks, are challenging the academia and standardization communities to manage these networks in completely novel and intelligent ways; otherwise, current network infrastructures can not offer a connection service with an acceptable quality for both emergent traffic demand and application requisites. In this way, a very relevant research problem that needs to be addressed is how a heterogeneous wireless access infrastructure should be controlled to offer a network access with a proper level of quality for diverse flows ending at multimode devices in mobile scenarios. The current chapter reviews recent research and standardization work developed under the most used wireless access technologies and mobile access proposals. It comprehensively outlines the impact on the deployment of those technologies in future networking environments, not only on the network performance but also in how the most important requirements of several relevant players, such as, content providers, network operators, and users/terminals can be addressed. Finally, the chapter concludes referring the most notable aspects in how the environment of future networks are expected to evolve like technology convergence, service convergence, terminal convergence, market convergence, environmental awareness, energy-efficiency, self-organized and intelligent infrastructure, as well as the most important functional requisites to be addressed through that infrastructure such as flow mobility, data offloading, load balancing and vertical multihoming.	access network;compaq lte;emergence;entity;linux mint;load balancing (computing);mobile ip;multihoming;network performance;next-generation network;osi model;proxy mobile ipv6;real-time locating system;requirement;routing;scalability;self-organization;software deployment;time complexity;user (computing);verification and validation;wireless access point	Jose Moura;Christopher Edwards	2016	CoRR		simulation;telecommunications;management science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-14.977785328637085	86.63782027563379	111405

Nodes intending to participate in such an overlay network initially have to find at least one node that is already part of this network. While structured P2P networks (e.g. distributed hash tables, DHTs) define rules about how to proceed after this point, unstructured P2P networks continue using bootstrapping techniques until they are sufficiently connected. In this paper, we compare solutions applicable to the bootstrapping problem. Measurements of an existing system, the Gnutella web caches, highlight the inefficiency of this particular approach. Improved bootstrapping mechanisms could also incorporate locality-awareness into the process. We propose an advanced mechanism by which the overlay topology is - to some extent - matched with the underlying topology. Thereby, the performance of the overall system can be vastly improved.	bootstrapping (compilers);distributed hash table;functional completeness;gnutella;locality of reference;overlay network;peer-to-peer;web cache	Curt Cramer;Kendy Kutzner;Thomas Fuhrmann	2004	Proceedings. 2004 12th IEEE International Conference on Networks (ICON 2004) (IEEE Cat.

This enables service providers to mix and match Cloud-based microservices and Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) that are provided by Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Provisioning complex services containing VNFs and Cloud-based microservices across NFV and cloud infrastructures can enhance service quality, reduce latency, and optimise cost. This can be provided by an orchestration system that can handle cross-ecosystem dependencies. To this end, we implemented Pishahang that is a framework for jointly managing and orchestrating virtual network functions and Cloud-based microservices. During the demo, we deploy several complex services to demonstrate features provided by Pishahang to support management and orchestration of complex services.	cloud computing;ecosystem;microservices;network function virtualization;open-source software;overhead (computing);provisioning	Hadi Razzaghi Kouchaksaraei;Tobias Dierich;Holger Karl	2018	2018 4th IEEE Conference on Network Softwarization and Workshops (NetSoft)	10.1109/NETSOFT.2018.8460134	service provider;architecture;orchestration (computing);microservices;computer network;virtual network;cloud computing;provisioning;service quality;computer science	Networks	-15.161938438477907	83.19496748537148	112153

Smartphones generate 95% of the total global handset traffic, and while approximately half of this traffic is sent to cellular networks, other handsets such as tablets are also using increasingly the cellular networks. This paper provides a closer look at the traffic generated on cellular networks by exploring billions of HTTP requests sent by millions of users to a nation-wide cellular network during 41 days. We confirm that - as in many other contexts - 20% of the users are responsible for more than 80% of the requests and provide a deeper analysis of the cellular network usage. Furthermore, we characterise the activity of users on their mobile device and which cloud services they use. For instance, almost 30% of the users use the cellular network frequently, mainly using search services and social networks, but 20% of their requests are sent to advertisement and tracking systems.	cloud computing;hypertext transfer protocol;mobile device;smartphone;social network;tracking system	Fehmi Ben Abdesslem;Anders Lindgren;Andrea Hess	2015	2015 12th Annual IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2015.7158036	mobile search;the internet;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;multimedia;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-18.367224102751535	75.73480015358805	112157

The proposed named-object multicast (NOMA) scheme employs unique names to identify multicast groups while using the global name resolution service (GNRS) to store the tree structure and maintain current mappings to mobile end-user addresses. The NOMA scheme achieves improved scalability and performance over conventional multicast protocols such as PIM-SM and MDSP by taking advantage of the GNRS to simplify tree management and limit control overhead. Performance evaluation results including comparisons with IP multicast are given using a combination of analysis and NS-3 simulation. The results show good scalability properties along with low control overhead for medium to large multicast groups. In addition, NOMA seamlessly handles mobility for end-hosts subscribed to a group, avoiding data losses upon mobility events. Results further demonstrate how separating names from addresses enables NOMA to dynamically forward traffic to mobile users. In conclusion, we describe a proof-of-concept prototype developed for further experimental validation of the proposed NOMA multicast routing scheme.	experiment;inter-domain;mdsp;multicast;network packet;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;prototype;routing;scalability;simulation;testbed;tree structure	Shreyasee Mukherjee;Francesco Bronzino;Suja Srinivasan;Jiachen Chen;Dipankar Raychaudhuri	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841564	communications protocol;routing;multicast;scalability;ip multicast;inter-domain;mobile telephony;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;multicast address;unicast	HPC	-12.817999360589043	83.33707585841482	112258

While forwarding elements can be managed by a unified control, complexity arisen from the network size and scalability regarding the increase of the control traffic are notable problems. To deal with events of network reconfiguration that occur asynchronously and change frequently with intervals shorter than hours, a controller has to continue to asynchronously update the configuration of the whole network. However, it is hard to maintain the consistency of the configuration of the whole network because it needs to manage a huge amount of network information and to deal with user requests that occur asynchronously. In this paper, we propose a database oriented management for asynchronous reconfiguration to achieve the consistency of configuration in SDN. We design a structure of the database to store network information and two functional components. Finally, we adopt our management system to an OpenFlow-based network, and validate that our system can manage and control an OpenFlow network via the database.	control plane;coupling (computer programming);database;forwarding plane;openflow;scalability;software-defined networking	Yuki Kawai;Yasuhiro Sato;Shingo Ata;Dijiang Huang;Deep Medhi;Ikuo Oka	2014	2014 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS)	10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838333	local area network;real-time computing;network management station;telecommunications;computer science;control system;operating system;database;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Networks	-14.252444119792477	82.39611288672828	112309
74249b4a0217395e40a51f9f34c94abec43d5043	a survey of scheduling policies in software defined networks		In the era of Software Defined Networks (SDNs), multi-policy resource management is extensively used to deliver ready-to-use media-optimized applications. Switches, ports and other shared resources are dynamically allocated to different flows, mostly based on priority. Such priority may be either externally set or computed depending upon various factors, such as flow package size, importance set by the user, age in the queue, etc. This resource schedule facilitates high speed communication under large scale distribution, efficiently manages the network bandwidth, and makes the resources available on demand while ensuring their efficient utilization. Keeping in mind the heterogeneity of network resources e.g., differences in capacity of handling workload, cost, energy consumption, and the (mostly) exponential distribution of flows granularity, a significant number of scheduling strategies has evolved in the literature of SDN. In this article we discuss such scheduling strategies, along with their advantages and disadvantages and we give a few research directions on the topic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article that focuses on scheduling strategies in SDN.	big data;network function virtualization;network performance;network switch;schedule;scheduling (computing);software-defined networking;time complexity	Anuradha Banerjee;Flavio Esposito	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)	10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384177	workload;resource management;real-time computing;port (computer networking);scheduling (computing);granularity;routing protocol;queue;software-defined networking;computer science	HPC	-10.67500870923863	84.35135778443784	112407
5f16bb0a71ce7fb4c440b26e3e1eb2a5982da7c2	a fast parallel-tree switch architecture for atm networks		In this paper we present a novel fast packet switch architecture based on Banyan interconnection networks, called parallel-tree Banyan switch fabric (PTBSF). It consists of parallel Banyans (multiple outlets) arranged in a tree topology. The packets enter at the topmost Banyan. Internal conflicts are eliminated by using a conflict-free 3 Ã 4 switching element which distributes conflicting cells over different Banyans. Thus, cell loss may occur only at the lowest Banyan. Increasing the number of Banyans leads to a noticeable decrease in cell loss rate. The switch can be engineered to provide arbitrarily high throughput and low cell loss rate without the use of input buffering or cell preprocessing. The performance of the switch is evaluated analytically under uniform traffic load and by simulation, under a variety of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) traffic loads. Compared to other proposed architectures, the switch exhibited stable and excellent performance with respect to cell loss and switching delay for all studied conditions as required by ATM traffic sources. The advantages of PTBSF are modularity, regularity, self-routing, low processing overhead, high throughput and robustness, under a variety of ATM traffic conditions. ï 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	atm turbo;interconnection;john d. wiley;network packet;overhead (computing);packet switching;preprocessor;routing;simulation;throughput;tree network	Mayez A.

f2fd25785e3d801dc1de8249794a78983b31b0c6	interconnection architectures for high-performance object-based file systems		As demand for storage bandwidth and capacity grows, designers have proposed the construction of petabytescale storage systems. Rather than relying upon a few very large storage arrays, these petabyte-scale systems have thousands of individual disks working together to provide aggregate storage system bandwidth exceeding 100 GB/s. However, providing this bandwidth to storage system clients becomes difficult due to limits in network technology. This paper discusses different interconnecti on topologies for large disk-based systems, drawing on previous experience from the parallel computing community. By choosing the right network, storage system designers can eliminate the need for expensive high-bandwidth communication links and provide a highly-redundant network resilient against single node failures. We analyze several di fferent topology choices and explore the tradeoffs between cost and performance. Using simulations, we uncover potential pitfalls, such as the placement of connections between the storage system network and its clients, that may arise when designing such a large system.	aggregate data;computer data storage;gigabyte;interconnection;multiprocessing;network topology;object storage;parallel computing;petabyte;simulation;storage area network	Andy Hospodor;Ethan L.

The transition to IPv6 holds the future of the internet infrastructure. Software-defined networking (SDN) defines a new concept for computer networks that can separate and provide abstract elements of network devices. IPv6 SDN has the potential to revolutionize the network design, construct and operate networks to achieve more efficient business network agility. In this paper, we will discuss the main architectures of SDN and illustrate how IPv6 can be deployed and integrated in SDN technologies using OpenFlow mechanisms. We will also discuss the IPv6 impact on link performance and deployment scenarios.	address space;end-to-end principle;network planning and design;openflow;software deployment;software-defined networking	Chia-Wei Tseng;Sheue-Ji Chen;Yao-Tsung Yang;Li-Der Chou;Ce-Kuen Shieh;Sheng-Wei Huang	2014	The 16th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium	10.1109/APNOMS.2014.6996530	the internet;network switch;computer science;information security;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Networks	-15.829613882363102	84.34756644547632	112803
e2ada3c68326c5ae39bb76153eaa3248e051f9d9	instantaneous recovery route design scheme using multiple coding-aware protection scenarios	instantaneous recovery;traffic splitting;network coding	This paper proposes an instantaneous recovery route design scheme using multiple coding-aware link protection scenarios to achieve higher link cost reduction in the network. In this scheme, two protection scenarios, namely, (i) traffic splitting (TS), and (ii) two sources and a common destination (2SD) are used to integrate multiple sources and a common destination. The proposed scheme consists of two phases. In the first phase, the proposed scheme determines routes for 2SD and TS scenarios of all possible source-destination pairs to minimize the total link cost. In this phase, the network coding is applied to the common path within each scenario, individually. In the second phase, network coding is applied to the common path between two scenarios (or a scenario pair) in order to enhance the resource saving. This phase develops conditions that select the most appropriate combination of scenario pairs, such as TSâTS, 2SDâ2SD, and 2SDâTS for network coding, including their proofs. Using these conditions, a heuristic algorithm is introduced in order to select the most appropriate combination of scenario pairs for further enhancing of resource saving. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional 1 + 1 protection scheme, the TS scenario, and the 2SD scenario in terms of link cost reduction in the network.

1d77ee2548bf659ed9a51dbafbaab65b8ee1b2b0	hybrid graph-based multicast traffic grooming in metro networks with quality-of-transmission considerations	physical layer impairments;optical networks;grooming;multicast routing	This paper investigates the problem of multicast traffic grooming in optical networks utilizing a novel grooming approach that is based on the routing/grooming of multicast calls on hybrid graphs (HGs). HGs are constructed dynamically upon the arrival of each multicast call, in such a way that they consist of both the available physical links and the logical links with available capacity. Several schemes were developed for the construction of the HGs, namely the minimum free capacity light-tree first, the maximum free capacity light-tree first, the maximum overlapping light-tree first, the least-used light-tree first, and the most-used light-tree first scheme. Also, a novel hybrid Steiner tree heuristic for routing/grooming on the HGs is presented. The proposed grooming approach exhibits improved performance in terms of blocking probability compared to existing multicast grooming approaches that route/groom multicast calls by considering physical and logical links separately. Furthermore, the physical layer impairments were also considered during the provisioning phase of the newly established light-trees on the HG, in which case the proposed schemes also exhibit improved performance compared to other grooming approaches.	algorithm;apollonian network;blocking (computing);erlang (unit);heuristic (computer science);multicast;passive optical network;provisioning;routing;steiner tree problem	Tania Panayiotou;Georgios Ellinas;Neo Antoniades	2015	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-015-0589-9	multicast;traffic grooming;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network	Metrics	-4.826579752892801	83.3390786641852	112926

In fact, as WDM technology keeps maturing, there is a bandwidth gap between the transmission speed of a wavelength channel (over a Gb/s) and the capacity requirement of customersâ connections. In this regard, building cost-efficient optical networks requires an efficient traffic grooming solution at the high speed optical access nodes. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new concept of traffic aggregation in wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks. Our objective is to reduce the network cost while preserving the benefits of all-optical wavelength-routed networks. In order to assess the efficiency of our proposal, all underlying network costs are compared. These costs include that of the transceivers required at node level as well as the number of wavelengths. Our results show that the proposed aggregation technique can significantly improve the network throughput while reducing its cost. c Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, so far, none of these efforts has exploited the opportunities of jointly using the Situation Management discipline and the mashup technology for network management. This paper introduces an approach, called Rich Dynamic Mashments, to facilitate the daily work of network administrators when dealing with unexpected, dynamic, and heterogeneous situations. We have referred to as nmsits to such type of network management situations (e.g., a sudden packet loss in a core router of a network backbone and an unforeseen slowness in data transmission over a link between virtual routers) and mashments to tunable mashups that use Situation Management for conducting network management tasks. The proposed approach is made up by the models of nmsits and mashments, the mechanisms to automatically recognize nmsits and dynamically compose mashments, and the architecture supporting these models and mechanisms. We further implement a prototype of our approach and conduct an extensive analysis on networks based on the Software-Defined Networking paradigm. The analysis results have provided directions and evidence that corroborate the feasibility of using Rich Dynamic Mashments as an effective approach for network management in terms of time-recognition, time-composition, time-consuming, time-response, and network traffic.	mashup (web application hybrid)	Oscar Mauricio Caicedo Rendon;Felipe Estrada Solano;Vinicius Tavares Guimaraes;Liane Margarida Rockenbach Tarouco;Lisandro Zambenedetti Granville	2016	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2015.10.024	organizational network analysis;network management;element management system;simulation;intelligent computer network;network architecture;network management station;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;network simulation;network management application;structure of management information;world wide web;computer security;mashup;computer network	Web+IR	-18.6579375084061	85.42336891378561	113212
827434a9f03078da0a6a5b01a11a27876eb67c65	enhancing data transfer performance utilizing a dtn between cloud service providers		The rapid transfer of massive data in the cloud environment is required to prepare for unexpected situations like disaster recovery. With regard to this requirement, we propose a new approach to transferring cloud virtual machine images rapidly in the cloud environment utilizing dedicated Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs). The overall procedure is composed of local/remote copy processes and a DTN-to-DTN transfer process. These processes are coordinated and executed based on a fork system call in the proposed algorithm. In addition, we especially focus on the local copy process between a cloud controller and DTNs and improve data transfer performance through the well-tuned mount techniques in Network File System (NFS)-based connections. Several experiments have been performed considering the combination of synchronous/asynchronous modes and the network buffer size. We show the results of throughput in all the experiment cases and compare them. Consequently, the best throughput in write operations has been obtained in the case of an NFS server in a DTN and an NFS client in a cloud controller running entirely in the asynchronous mode.	algorithm;asynchronous circuit;cloud computing;delay-tolerant networking;disaster recovery;experiment;fork (software development);fork (system call);server (computing);system call;throughput;virtual machine;whole earth 'lectronic link	Wontaek Hong;Jeonghoon Moon;Woojin Seok;Jin-Wook Chung	2018	Symmetry	10.3390/sym10040110	disaster recovery;combinatorics;mount;cloud computing;asynchronous communication;system call;fork (system call);network file system;virtual machine;distributed computing;mathematics	HPC	-16.105925896192183	80.06663137699937	113238

However, previous work has found that many Web sites either do not take advantage of such techniques or unknowingly inhibit their use. In this paper, we present the design of a tool called Cassandra that addresses these problems. Web site developers can use Cassandra to achieve three goals: (i) to identify protocol correctness and conformance problems; (ii) to identify content delivery performance problems; and (iii) to evaluate the potential benefits of using content delivery optimizations. Cassandra combines performance and behavioral data, together with an extensible simulation architecture, to identify content delivery problems and predict optimization benefits. We describe the architecture of Cassandra and demonstrate its use to evaluate the potential benefits of a CDN on a large Web server farm.	apache cassandra;conformance testing;content delivery network;correctness (computer science);digital distribution;extensibility;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;server (computing);server farm;simulation;user interface;web content;web server	Leeann Bent;Michael Rabinovich;Geoffrey M.

7f53294b8c294414b163bc59961064213a952b43	on coding for reliable vnf chaining in dcns		We study how erasure coding can improve service reliability in Data Center Networks (DCN). To this end, we find that coding can be best deployed in systems, where i) traffic is split into multiple parallel sub-flows, ii) each sub-flow is encoded; iii) SFC along with their corresponding Virtual Network Functions (VNF) concatenated are replicated into at least as many VNF instances as there are sub-flows, resulting in parallel subSFCs; and iv) all coded sub-flows are distributed over parallel paths and processed in parallel. We study service reliability as function of the level of parallelization within DCN and the resulting amount of redundancy. Based on the probability theory and by considering failures of path segments, VNF and server failures, we analytically derive the probability that parallel subflows are successfully processed by the parallelized SFC and that the original serial traffic can be successfully recovered without service interruptions. We compare the proposed failure protection with coding and the standard backup protection and evaluate the related overhead of both methods, including decoding, traffic redirection and VNF migration. The results not only show the benefit of our scheme for reliability, but also a reduced overhead required in comparison to backup protection.	backup;backward chaining;concatenation;data center;dynamic circuit network;end-to-end principle;erasure code;overhead (computing);parallel computing;parallel programming model;server (computing);space-filling curve	Anna Engelmann;Admela Jukan;Rastin Pries	2018	CoRR		redundancy (engineering);coding (social sciences);computer network;erasure code;virtual network;distributed computing;decoding methods;chaining;data center;backup;computer science	HPC	-12.951507660074958	82.60294582974929	113369

Traditional network architectures are ill-suited to meet the requirements of today's Information and Communication Technology (ICT) service providers and end users. Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) are new technologies that can provide unlimited opportunities for next generation network. Both SDN and NFV technologies are not only transforming network infrastructure from complicate physical entities to virtual and programmable nodes, but also bringing significant changes to the development of ICT. SDN and NFV enable software-driven service chain named Service Function Chain (SFC), a technology controlling the traffic flow to the appropriate applications and delivering an abstract sequenced set of service functions according to the various service requirements. In conclusion, a novel architecture as a security service platform with on-demand virtual network functions is proposed. The solution offers a security service function chain that enables ICT service providers to provision a dynamic and flexible secure service on the SDN network. Advantages of the proposed architecture are on-demand, cost effective and flexibility.	entity;network function virtualization;network security;next-generation network;requirement;security management;security service (telecommunication);software-defined networking;space-filling curve	Li-Der Chou;Chia-Wei Tseng;Yu-Ki Huang;Kuo-Chung Chen;Tsung-Fu Ou;Chia-Kuan Yen	2016	2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763487	service level requirement;network intelligence;differentiated service;computer science;service delivery framework;service design;security service;world wide web;computer security;computer network	HPC	-16.271387225616422	84.60153778700685	113405

The transmission bandwidth consumed by delivering rich content is enormous. Therefore, it is urgent for Internet service providers to design an efficient delivery system that minimizes the amount of network resources consumed. Content delivery networks are widely used to reduce the flow hop length and the response time when obtaining content items. To improve the cache efficiency, various methods of replacing caches have been proposed, with the target of improving the cache hit ratio. The effect of reducing the traffic load on network links by delivering content items from caches depends on the distance from the origin server to the users. However, many existing methods do not consider the origin server distance. To maximize the effect of reducing the link load obtained by caches, we propose here a cache-replacement policy based on the hop distance to the origin servers. To simplify the caching algorithm, we divide the storage capacity of cache severs into multiple virtual caches and manage content items separately on the basis of the hop distance to origin servers. We also propose an optimal method for designing the capacities of virtual caches that maximizes the total expected reduction of flow hop length. Through numerical evaluation, we show that the proposed method can decrease the average link load by about 10% compared with the normal least recently used.	algorithm;cache (computing);content delivery network;digital video;download;hit (internet);internet;network congestion;network traffic control;numerical analysis;peak signal-to-noise ratio;response time (technology);server (computing);structural similarity;web server	Noriaki Kamiyama;Yuusuke Nakano;Kohei Shiomoto	2016	IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management	10.1109/TNSM.2016.2600240	real-time computing;cache;computer science;operating system;cache algorithms;world wide web;server;computer network	Metrics	-16.160645408194927	74.60335605937568	113427

This paper assesses the effectiveness of these contention minimization strategies and the impact of key network and traffic parameters, such as the maximum tolerable burst delay at the ingress nodes, average offered traffic load, number of wavelengths per link, average burst hop count, and node connectivity degree.	algorithm;burst transmission;direct-broadcast satellite;fragmentation (computing);gnu free documentation license;load (computing);optical burst switching;requirement;simulation;test engineer;throughput	JoÃ£o Manuel Ferreira Pedro;Paulo P.

Fault-tolerant routing for WDM routed all-optical networks has not been studied in details in the literature except for using protection switching or loopback recovery. Such schemes use predetermined protection mechanism and hence assume that the protection path is not faulty. This paper considers extensions to a dynamic routing scheme (presented earlier by these authors for fault-free networks) to handle rerouting in case of fault occurrence. The performance degradations of the network because of fault occurrence are then studied in terms of blocking probability and set-up time through simulations.	blocking (computing);distributed algorithm;erlang (unit);loopback;protection mechanism;routing;simulation;uptime;wavelength-division multiplexing	Abhijit Sengupta;Subir Bandyopadhyay;Arunita Jaekel	2000	Photonic Network Communications	10.1023/A:1026522715035	routing table;distributed algorithm;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;adaptive routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;fault management;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Networks	-7.000379299673843	80.47219142572744	113712

In this paper, we first briefly review Traffic Engineering challenges in MPLS networks. We then discuss on how Software-Defined Networking (SDN) could overcome Label Switched Path (LSP) path calculation challenges in MPLS Traffic Engineering. We discuss that a centralized SDN Controller has network-wide visibility thus should become âsource of truthâ of network state. We discuss that OpenDaylight has capabilities as centralized SDN Controller, however one needs to build application on top of OpenDaylight. An application of SDN Controller based on OpenDaylight is proposed in this paper. To verify the application functionalities, a virtual lab is created to model an MPLS network and an OpenDaylight SDN Controller.

In recent years, a new class of networks which fulfill these requirements evolved, wireless mesh networks (WMNs). Although WMNs satisfy the demand for high bandwidth and Internet access, there is a further, fundamental factor of success: the simple use. Except for small networks, manual configuration is infeasible. The task of auto configuration includes the assignment of unique addresses, the management of free and assigned addresses, and the autonomous reaction to failures. In this paper we introduce and evaluate a novel auto configuration protocol for WMNs: the Dynamic WMN Configuration Protocol (DWCP). DWCP deals with all mentioned issues for large WMN installations and was deployed and evaluated in a real testbed.	address pool;algorithm;auto-configuration;autonomous robot;internet access;mesh networking;performance evaluation;requirement;testbed;types of mesh;wireless mesh network	Alexander Zimmermann;Arnd Hannemann;Benjamin Schleinzer	2008	2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1002/wcm.982	wireless mesh network;telecommunications;computer science;order one network protocol;link-local address;dynamic host configuration protocol;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-16.38892319316984	85.0306194823299	114014

The framework comprises a dynamic tree of clients which also act as relays to distribute video downstream and monitor network conditions, a lightweight server to manage the tree and a gossip-spiral mechanism to improve the tree robustness. The framework is loosely coupled such that failure of the lightweight server will not impact the data distribution functionality of the tree. The motivation of such an application-level approach which does not require router intervention, stems from the fact that IP-multicast is not enabled prevalently in most parts of the Internet. Streaming applications thus have to depend on a network of servers, relays and static tunnels instead of the more efficient multicast for data distribution across the Internet. Such conventional static approach is less efficient than the proposed dynamic framework as the tree is configured on the fly taking prevailing network conditions into account. Moreover, it is able to self-improve and self-recover through the process of a client switching to another parent for a better QoS. The performance of the framework has been evaluated against unicast and multicast and both experimental and simulation results show that the framework is superior to unicast in performance. In fact, simulation results show that the framework is able to track ideal multicast (minimum spanning tree) in performance under non-congested network conditions.	multicast;streaming media	Chai Kiat Yeo;Bu-Sung Lee;Meng Hwa Er	2003	J.

f6997df8c6fac66c9f853ff437ca605a6c374161	a novel sdn scheme for qos path allocation in wide area networks		The massive adoption of Cloud services has led to the explosion of traffic transiting over the Cloud infrastructure. Such an impressive evolution of data demand will inevitably be the catalyst of Operator infrastructure transformation. In this context, Software Defined Networking (SDN) is the technology that is shaping the future of carriersu0027 networks. SDN considerably reduces the complexity of managing the network infrastructure while providing tremendous computational power compared to legacy devices. In this paper, we address the resource allocation issue in Wide Area Networks (WAN) while considering the requested QoS. To do so, we design an SD-WAN architecture to enhance the network resources allocation and hence improve the QoS of distributed applications. We formulate first the path computation problem as an Integer Linear Program while taking into consideration both network application requirements and the network occupation status. The problem is then resolved in a polynomial time leveraging the Branch-and-Cut algorithm. Results obtained with our experimental platform, show that the proposed SD-WAN framework outperforms the most prominent related solutions in terms of applicationsu0027 satisfaction level and consumption of networku0027s resources.	algorithm;border gateway protocol;branch and cut;cloud computing;computation;computational problem;distributed computing;forward compatibility;interrupt;linear programming;link-state routing protocol;load balancing (computing);noise shaping;quality of service;requirement;sd-wan;secure digital;software-defined networking;source routing;time complexity;virtual machine	Ilhem Fajjari;Nadjib Aitsaadi;Djamel Eddine Kouicem	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254432	computer network;architecture;time complexity;operator (computer programming);quality of service;software-defined networking;cloud computing;routing protocol;computer science;resource allocation	HPC	-9.769510587245067	82.98749851904091	114065

We call our protocol MeDeHa (pronounced """"medea"""") for Message Delivery in Heterogeneous, Disruption-prone Networks. MeDeHa is complementary to the IRTF's Bundle Architecture: while the Bundle Architecture provides storage above the transport layer in order to enable interoperability among networks that support different types of transport layers, MeDeHa stores data at the link layer addressing heterogeneity at lower layers (e.g., when intermediate nodes do not support higher-layer protocols). MeDeHa also takes advantage of network heterogeneity (e.g., nodes supporting more than one network) to improve message delivery. For example, in the case of IEEE 802.11 networks, participating nodes may use both infrastructure- and ad hoc modes to deliver data to otherwise unavailable destinations. Another important feature of MeDeHa is that there is no need to deploy special-purpose nodes such as message ferries, data mules, or throwboxes in order to relay data to intended destinations, or to connect to the backbone network wherever infrastructure is available. The network is able to store data destined to temporarily unavailable nodes for some time depending upon existing storage as well as quality-of-service issues such as delivery delay bounds imposed by the application. We evaluate MeDeHa via simulations using indoor scenarios (e.g. convention centers, exposition halls, museums etc.) and show significant improvement in delivery ratio in the face of episodic connectivity. We also showcase MeDeHa's support for different levels of quality-of-service through traffic differentiation and message prioritization."""	data mule;hoc (programming language);internet backbone;interoperability;quality of service;relay;simulation	Rao Naveed Bin Rais;Thierry Turletti;Katia Obraczka	2008		10.1145/1454503.1454542	embedded system;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-8.680131190792512	88.50295248965303	114525
b82c66ed3b89cd637afa6ffe5e8c3c5db40b2cf8	hpm: a novel hierarchical peer-to-peer model for lookup acceleration with provision of physical proximity	routing optimization;hpm;physical proximity;hierarchical p2p	It is well known that Peer-to-Peer systems are generally featured with high flexibility and scalability, enabling dynamic resources localization and mutualization, and allowing the nodes to freely join and leave. But in some special environments such as mobile P2P networks, routing optimization, resources reliability and availability are critical concerns. To deal with these issues, we propose a novel architecture, termed hierarchical Peer-to-Peer model or HPM for short, based on Chord for improving P2P network performance in the presence of such additional requirements as fault tolerance and self organization. Specifically, HPM is composed of a set of hierarchical rings, each of which consists of the nodes that are both physically and logically close to each other or we say they have physical proximity, supporting inter and intra routing mechanisms. We show that the cost of lookup for HPM is OÃ° P4 i 1â4 1 log2Ã°niÃÃ, where ni represents the number of nodes on ring level i (with the maximum of 256 nodes in each ring in the case of four levels). Each node maintains a routing table with only 2 OÃ°log2Ã°niÃÃ entries, greatly facilitating HPM to work in resource-limited terminals such as mobile phones or PDA. In particular, when HPM is combined with a broadcast mechanism, the lookup process can be significantly improved (four hops). Our simulations and comparative studies demonstrate that HPM can achieve satisfactory P2P performance with rapid convergence thanks to the cost-optimal lookup algorithm. & 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

7aa1f7c286bb107c469ec1a92df1df51c464400a	achieving resilience of heterogeneous networks through predictive, formal analysis	formal analysis;heterogeneous network	"""Rapid development and wide deployment of wireless technologies in recent years have brought an increasing number and variety of services that are accessible directly from mobile terminals via multiple network access technologies (e.g, Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, LTE, etc). A particular traffic flow may go through different kinds of networks, which greatly increases the end-to-end connectivity opportunities. However, the disadvantage of multinetworks is that a failure or change in one network type may affect many traffic flows. Thus, the various networks in a multinetwork cannot be managed in isolation. Rather we need methodologies that analyze the effects of changes in these dynamic and heterogeneous network environments in unison. Traditional network analysis approaches only focus on static network attributes and do not fully consider the impact of failures on quality of services (QoS) across flows. In this paper, we design and implement a """"what-if"""" analysis methodology using formal methods. Our methodology analyzes the impact of failures and changes in heterogeneous networks on QoS of flows. The results of the formal analysis can guide network administrators in their decisions to proactively adapt network configurations to achieve mission or application objectives. We illustrate our methodology with the help of use cases such as incorporating additional nodes in a network or reconfiguring the network due to failure. We compare our results with conventional network configuration approaches and show how our formal methodology provides more effective decision support than conventional network configuration approaches and that it scales better than simulation approaches."""	access network;backup;bluetooth;compaq lte;decision support system;end-to-end principle;experiment;formal language;formal methods;heterogeneous computing;maude system;quality of service;simulation;social network analysis;software deployment;unison	Zhijing Qin;Grit Denker;Carolyn L.

In particular, we investigate the use of """"higher protocol layers"""", such as layer 4, to help provide self healing capability. Next, we illustrate the power of modeling and simulation (M&S) to provide insights into the performance of complex aspects of wireless networks, since the complexity of the self-healing mechanisms coupled with the stochastic nature of the underlying network renders the use of analytic techniques infeasible unless otherwise simplifying assumptions are made. The latter, however, distort the system and even lead to misleading conclusions.

Unfortunately, almost all active probing algorithms ignore the measurement conflict problem: Active measurements conflict with each other due to the nature of these measurements, the associated overhead, and the network topology which results in reporting incorrect results. In this paper, we consider the problem of scheduling periodic QoS measurement tasks in overlay networks. We first show that this problem is NP-complete, and then propose a conflict-aware scheduling algorithm whose goal is to maximize the number of measurement tasks that can run concurrently, based on a well known approximation algorithm. Simulation results show that our algorithm achieves 25% better schedulability over the existing algorithm.

However, with the increasing popularity of vehicular cloud services, accessing vehicular terminals and produced mobile data are experiencing tremendous growth, therefore, how to provide enough capacity for all access requirements and handle all the mobile data traffic to address the challenges posed by richer vehicular applications are critical. In future 5G mobile networks, promoted by the advantages of supporting various connectivity and significantly faster transmission performance of 5G communications, VCC will be enabled to provide more realistic vehicular data cloud services. In this article, an innovative VCC platform with the support of 5G communications for providing effective vehicular data cloud services is first proposed.

The traffic could be groomed at the access node before converting to an optical signal carried in the all-optical network. We design a virtual topology with a given physical topology to satisfy multiple objectives and constraints. The grooming problem of a static demand is considered as an optimization problem. The algorithms found in the literatures focus on a single objective either to maximize the performance or to minimize the cost. We propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to solve a grooming problem that optimizes multiple objectives all together at the same time. In this paper we consider the optimization of three objectives: maximize the traffic throughput, minimize the number of transceivers, and minimize the average propagation delay or average hop counts. The simulation results show that our approach is superior to an existing heuristic approaches for the 6-node benchmark network in an acceptable running time.		Passakon Prathombutr;Jerrold F. Stach;E.

By assigning wavelengths to the receivers and transmitters at each station, one can de ne the logical connectivity of the network independently of the underlying physical topology. The advent of fast tunable optical transmitters and receivers makes it feasible to dynamically update the network connectivity to accommodate tra c demands that vary over time. Of major concern in such design is how the connectivity should react to changes in tra c patterns. The problem is formulated as a Markovian Decision Process and the properties of the optimal con guration policy are identi ed. These properties are then used to develop an algorithm for obtaining policies that make decisions similar to the decisions of the optimal policy. A procedure is also proposed to manage the large state space for systems with a large number of stations.	algorithm;lightwave 3d;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;state space;transmitter;wavelength-division multiplexing	George N.

ebddfe799d9977185bb5ae25c79445fc4ee06db8	sdn-based mobility management and qos support for vehicular ad-hoc networks		Along with non-safety related applications, traffic safety is the major concern of the Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). However, the mobility management due to the high speed of vehicles, intermittent connectivity, and frequent topology variations are some of the crucial roadblocks. These challenges impose setback for quality of service (QoS) guarantee that leads to unfulfilled goals of VANETs deployment. The centralized control of the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm allows optimum utilization of global network view to meet the QoS requirements. Furthermore, by a systematic design of the SDN control plane, the issues of mobility management and poor network connectivity can also be addressed in an efficient manner. In this paper, we propose an SDN-based architecture that utilizes cloud computing and deals with inherent constraints of VANETs. A logically distributed control plane is devised for seamless connectivity, mobility management, and QoS support. The proposed model achieves optimum performance and robustness against failures by harnessing capabilities of SDN and cloud computing. We implemented the QoS and routing applications to evaluate the proposed model. The comparative experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.	access network;centralized computing;cloud computing;coherence (physics);control plane;data store;distributed control system;distributed database;global network;hoc (programming language);multihoming;programming paradigm;quality of service;real-time clock;requirement;routing;seamless3d;software deployment;software-defined networking	Kuldip Singh Atwal;Ajay Guleria;Mostafa A.

However, the quality of the network services has so far rarely been considered in composing and executing scientific workflows. Currently, scientific applications tune the execution quality of workflows neglecting network resources, and by selecting only optimal software services and computing resources. One reason is that IP-based networks provide few possibilities for workflow systems to manage the service quality, and limit or prevent bandwidth reservation or network paths selection. We see nonetheless a strong need from scientific applications, and network operators, to include the network quality management in the workflow systems. Novel network infrastructures open up new possibilities in network tuning at the application level. In this position paper, we discuss our vision on this issue and propose an agent based solution to include network resources in the loop of workflow composition, scheduling and execution when advanced network services are available. We present the first prototype of our approach in the context of the CineGrid project.	agent-based model;display resolution;e-science;prototype;quality of service;scheduling (computing);sensor	Zhiming Zhao;Paola Grosso;Ralph Koning;Jeroen van der Ham;Cees T.

The design is scalable for large numbers of inputs due to a low hardware complexity, O(N log/sub 2/ N), and distributed operation and control.

In this paper, we study a dynamic label switched path (LSP) routing problem for the three different network models of the IP/MPLS over WDM network, namely, Overlay, Augmented, and Peer models. For the overlay model, we propose two algorithms: ECF_OVLY and MLH_OVLY. In ECF_OVLY, a network always tries to use existing capacity first, whereas in MLH_OVLY, a network finds a path with the minimum number of logical hops for an LSP request. We also propose, for the augmented model, two simple and efficient dynamic LSP provisioning algorithms, called MCPI_AUG and DCPI_AUG, utilizing different type/amount of summarized capacity information from the WDM layer, namely Minimum CaPacity Information (MCPI) and Detailed CaPacity Information (DCPI). We compare the proposed algorithms with the existing algorithms available for the overlay [1] and peer [2], [3] models. The algorithms are compared and evaluated using two key performance measures: LSP blocking probability and network (lightpath) utilization. Simulation results show that at low loads with a limited number of ports available in the network, DCPI_AUG achieves an order of magnitude better blocking performance than the algorithm in [2] and outperforms the one in [3] by more than three times. It also achieves higher network utilization than the one in [2] by more than 10 % and the one in [3] by 2-7 % depending on the traffic load. Considering the small amount of information that is exchanged between the layers in the augmented model, these results suggest that the augmented model can be a practically good compromise between the overlay and peer models.	algorithm;blocking (computing);end-to-end principle;erlang (unit);multiprotocol label switching;peer-to-peer;provisioning;routing;simulation;wavelength-division multiplexing	Sunggy Koo;Gokhan Sahin;Suresh Subramaniam	2006	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2006.258222	overlay network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;optical cross-connect;computer network	Metrics	-5.923895960328317	84.64550260819725	116497

For streaming applications, latency is one of the most important metrics which affect user experience. However, network dynamics such as congestion and bandwidth fluctuation cause instability in the peer overlay and increase peer latency. To avoid wasting network resources on overlay redirection, we introduce our scheduling algorithm [6] into the peers on the overlay to distribute most important packets to the descendant peers first. We also alter Maximum Bandwidth Sum Tree overlay construction scheme [4] to cater for streaming application and investigate our scheduling algorithm in such an environment. Performance results show the improvement in terms of latency and data arrival ratio before the expiration time.	algorithm;distributed computing;instability;network congestion;overlay network;peer-to-peer;quantum fluctuation;scheduling (computing);user experience	Jiaming Li;Chai Kiat Yeo;Bu-Sung Lee	2008		10.1145/1352793.1352845	user experience design;overlay network;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;network dynamics;machine learning;peer-to-peer;database;distributed computing;cluster analysis;scheduling;world wide web;computer network	Networks	-13.653922085001078	75.50956591056578	116528

The centralized controller provides the global view of the distributed network states for user applications. However, the scalability of SDN is subject to the delay, the capacity of the controller, the bandwidth of the control channel, and other issues. To solve this problem, peer-to-peer (p2p) SDN, where multiple independent controllers control their own networks and these controllers exchange the only required state changing events, is an emerging control plane architecture. In this paper, we focus on the traffic engineering in the p2p SDN administrated by one operator. We first identify some fundamental challenges (i.e., path aggregation for advertisement, routing loop, overhead) for the traffic engineering in the p2p SDN. Then we proposed a novel protocol exchanging the required network information to enable the traffic engineering between neighboring SDN domains. The experiments show that our protocol can achieve nearly same performance (about 98%) as the one with God's knowledge (the full information of the whole network). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article to investigate the traffic engineering problem in the p2p SDN.	centralized computing;control plane;experiment;forwarding plane;inter-domain;microsoft windows 98;operand forwarding;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;programming paradigm;routing;scalability;simulation;software deployment;software-defined networking	Hemin Yang;George F.

In this paper, we propose a new efficient algorithm for dynamic SPT update to avoid the disadvantages (e.g. redundant computation) caused by static SPT update algorithms. The new algorithm is based on the understanding of the update procedure to reduce redundancy. Only significant elements that contribute to the construction of new SPT from the old one are focused on. The efficiency of our algorithm is improved because it only pay attention to the edges really count for the update process. The running time for the proposed algorithm is maximum reduced, which is shown through experimental results. Furthermore, our algorithm can be easily generalized to solve the SPT updating problem in a graph with negative weight edges and applied to the scenario of multiple edge weight changes.	adjacency list;computation;dijkstra's algorithm;dynamic problem (algorithms);hall-effect thruster;link-state routing protocol;multiple edges;shortest path problem;symmetry protected topological order;time complexity	Bin Xiao;Jiannong Cao;Qingfeng Zhuge;Zili Shao;Edwin Hsing-Mean Sha	2004	7th International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Networks, 2004.

Moving close to a global maximization of available resources usage and assuming high resiliency under failures, LOCARN focuses on components coupling simplicity and plug-and-play guidance. The following article presents the architecture and then evaluates its performances. Specifically, LOCARN produces significant overheads in counterparty of its suitable properties, because of the radicality of its design. Considering its overall characteristics, we envision LOCARN as an alternative to current packet transport network architectures based on IP/MPLS, typically metropolitan and cores subparts of operatorsâ networks. We show thereafter that in a such use case the overhead impact is acceptable and even negligible beside the transmission capacities available in such networks. To do so, we rely on analysis, on computer simulations and finally on a statistical model.	computer simulation;counterparty;expectationâmaximization algorithm;mesh networking;multiprotocol label switching;network architecture;network packet;object access method;overhead (computing);performance;plug and play;point-to-point (telecommunications);routing;scalability;statistical model	Damien Le QuÃ©rÃ©;Christophe Betoule;Remi Clavier;Yassine Hadjadj Aoul;Adlen Ksentini;Gilles ThouÃ©non	2014	Stud.

c1962d81eae11faa2769112812a77112e3130330	ustash: a novel mobile content delivery system for improving user qoe in public transport		Mobile data traffic is growing exponentially and it is even more challenging to distribute content efficiently while users are âon the moveâ such as in public transport. The use of mobile devices for accessing content (e.g., videos) while commuting are both expensive and unreliable, although it is becoming common practice worldwide. Leveraging on the spatial and temporal correlation of content popularity and usersâ diverse network connectivity, we propose a novel content distribution system, uStash, which guarantees better QoE with regards to access delays and cost of usage. The proposed collaborative download and content stashing schemes provide the uStash provider the flexibility to control the cost of content access via cellular networks. We model the uStash system in a probabilistic framework and thereby analytically derive the optimal portions for collaborative downloading. Then, we validate the proposed models using real-life trace driven simulations. In particular, we use dataset from 22 inter-city buses running on six different routes and from a mobile VoD service provider to show that uStash reduces the cost of monthly cellular data by approximately 50 percent and the expected delay for content access by 60 percent compared to content downloaded via usersâ cellular network connections.	digital distribution;download;mobile device;real life;simulation	Fangzhou Jiang;Kanchana Thilakarathna;Sirine Mrabet;Mohamed Ali KÃ¢afar;Aruna Seneviratne	2018	CoRR	10.1109/tmc.2018.2859318	mobile broadband;service provider;computer network;last mile;probabilistic logic;mobile device;computer science;quality of experience;distributed computing;cellular network;upload	Mobile	-18.45820002027291	76.00301830317646	117068

We develop a matrix-based approach for calculating the availability of a VON mapping with shared backup path protection. In order to efficiently evaluate the maximum availability of a VON mapping, we transform the problem to a group node-weighted Steiner tree problem and propose an efficient auxiliary-graph-based availability (AA) algorithm to find a VON mapping with high availability. Based on the availability evaluation, we propose a heuristic algorithm to map the VON, and numerical results show that our algorithms are effective in achieving high availability while reducing the total link cost and the blocking rate.	algorithm;backup;blocking (computing);heuristic (computer science);high availability;network mapping;numerical analysis;numerical method;path protection;requirement;steiner tree problem;virtual private network	Jian Kong;Jason P.

Using the most current Internet topology is not practical since its size is prohibitive for detailed, packet-level interdomain simulations. Besides being of moderate size, the topology should be policy-aware, that is, it needs to represent business relationships between adjacent nodes (that represent autonomous systems). In this paper, we address this issue by providing a framework to generate small, realistic, and policy-aware topologies. We propose HBR, a novel sampling method, which exploits the inherent hierarchy of the policy-aware Internet topology. We formally prove that our approach generates connected and legitimate topologies, which are compatible with the policy-based routing conventions and rules. Using simulations, we show that HBR generates topologies that: 1) maintain the graph properties of the real topology; 2) provide reasonably realistic interdomain simulation results while reducing the computational complexity by several orders of magnitude as compared to the initial topology. Our approach provides a permanent solution to the problem of interdomain routing evaluations: Given a more accurate and complete topology, HBR can generate better small topologies in the future.	autonomous system (internet);computational complexity theory;graph property;inter-domain;internet topology;network packet;routing;sampling (signal processing);simulation	Yihua He;Michalis Faloutsos;Srikanth V.

Specifically, it reduces packet delays and packet loss rates. Such advantages are especially useful in core networks where many different users can benefit from this at once. Hence, network coding should be transparently integrated in technologies suitable for core networks. We present an extension for MPLS and RSVP-TE which can instantiate network-coded paths in core networks. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated in a proof-of-concept simulation.	linear network coding;multiprotocol label switching;rsvp-te;test engineer	Thorsten Biermann;Arne Schwabe;Holger Karl	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-01399-7_69	telecommunications;computer science;processing delay;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;transmission delay;computer network	Theory	-8.653121286418555	87.43388271543215	117239
2a628e4a9c5f78bc6dcdf16514353336547846cc	achieving high utilization with software-driven wan	inter dc wan;software defined networking	We present SWAN, a system that boosts the utilization of inter-datacenter networks by centrally controlling when and how much traffic each service sends and frequently re-configuring the network's data plane to match current traffic demand. But done simplistically, these re-configurations can also cause severe, transient congestion because different switches may apply updates at different times. We develop a novel technique that leverages a small amount of scratch capacity on links to apply updates in a provably congestion-free manner, without making any assumptions about the order and timing of updates at individual switches. Further, to scale to large networks in the face of limited forwarding table capacity, SWAN greedily selects a small set of entries that can best satisfy current demand. It updates this set without disrupting traffic by leveraging a small amount of scratch capacity in forwarding tables. Experiments using a testbed prototype and data-driven simulations of two production networks show that SWAN carries 60% more traffic than the current practice.	caesar;data center;denial-of-service attack;forwarding plane;greedy algorithm;michael maltz;network congestion;network switch;prototype;simulation;testbed	Chi-Yao Hong;Srikanth Kandula;Ratul Mahajan;Ming Zhang;Vijay Gill;Mohan Nanduri;Roger Wattenhofer	2013		10.1145/2486001.2486012	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;software-defined networking;computer security;computer network	Networks	-13.483528735363882	81.42821764098169	117375

However, network operators all over the world are experiencing a decline in profitability in the last few years. Responding to such a challenge and paradox, the concept of network function virtualization (NFV) has been introduced with the aim of efficiently enabling networkbased services (1) by deploying standardized and programmable hardware systems and (2) by virtualizing network functions with software. Compared to the current approaches to network and service deployment, which are based on a large variety of propriety equipment, NFV opens up many opportunities to the telecommunications industry. By reducing the cost of equipment and increasing the revenue with virtualized services, NFV has the potential to revolutionize the entire telecommunication industry.	network function virtualization	Kejie Lu;Shucheng Liu;Fred Feisullin;Mehmet Ersue;Yu Cheng	2015	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2015.7113218	virtualization;network architecture;computer science;operating system;computer network	Visualization	-15.391964907621851	86.19447464443894	117422

The FiWi network is thought by many as a very promising architecture for the future network. From the standpoint of the Internet service provider (ISP), though the FiWi network has the advantages of high capacity and high flexibility, there is still a great discordant part between the fiber subnetwork and the wireless subnetwork, which is the necessary transformation of their protocols. Technically, it is still difficult to achieve the FiWi network's seamless networking. In this paper, we apply network virtualization to hide the differences between the fiber network and the wireless network, in which the ISP is separated into two independent entities: the infrastructure provider (InP) and the service provider (SP). We also propose a general model for the FiWi access network virtualization. The proposed model decouples applications from infrastructure networks and allows SPs provide users with services carried by granular virtual networks (VNs), which is composed by the virtual resources allocated by InPs. The results of a simulation are demonstrated, which prove that our model is superior to the FiWi network without virtualization.	access network;algorithm;entity;hardware virtualization;seamless3d;simulation;subnetwork	Qinglong Dai;Guochu Shou;Yihong Hu;Zhigang Guo	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC)	10.1109/ICCW.2013.6649354	wireless wan;resource allocation;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-13.66710141802273	86.14318623643904	117457

Today we lack fine-grained control over network bandwidth partitioning across tenants. In this paper we present EyeQ, a simple and practical system that provides tenants with bandwidth guarantees as if their endpoints were connected to a dedicated switch. To realize this goal, EyeQ leverages the high bisection bandwidth in a datacenter fabric and enforces admission control on traffic, regardless of the tenant transport protocol. We show that this pushes bandwidth contention to the networkâs edge, enabling EyeQ to support endto-end minimum bandwidth guarantees to tenant endpoints in a simple and scalable manner at the servers. EyeQ requires no changes to applications and is deployable with support from the network available today. We evaluate EyeQ with an efficient software implementation at 10Gb/s speeds using unmodified applications and adversarial traffic patterns. Our evaluation demonstrates EyeQâs promise of predictable network performance isolation. For instance, even with an adversarial tenant with bursty UDP traffic, EyeQ is able to maintain the 99.9th percentile latency for a collocated memcached application close to that of a dedicated deployment.	bisection bandwidth;cloud computing;data center;memcached;network performance;scalability;software deployment	Vimalkumar Jeyakumar;Mohammad Alizadeh;David MaziÃ¨res;Balaji Prabhakar;Albert G.

The high stability and scalability offered by the protocol motivated its use for other critical networking services, making BGP a key component for IP networks. BGP was, however, unable to adapt to network changes fast enough to fulfill the Service Level Agreements imposed to operators. Different proposals had been made in the last years to adapt BGP to these stricter requirements. This document surveys these enhancements, focusing on those already accessible to network operators or in an advanced state of standardization. We describe and compare these techniques with different alternatives, and provide basic recommendations for their deployment and operation.

Comparing graphs requires a metric to discriminate which features of the graphs are considered important. The spectrum of a graph is often claimed to contain all the information within a graph, but the raw spectrum contains too much information to be directly used as a useful metric. In this paper we introduce a metric, the weighted spectral distribution, that improves on the raw spectrum by discounting those eigenvalues believed to be unimportant and emphasizing the contribution of those believed to be important.  We use this metric to optimize the selection of parameter values for generating Internet topologies. Our metric leads to parameter choices that appear sensible given prior knowledge of the problem domain: the resulting choices are close to the default values of the topology generators and, in the case of some generators, fall within the expected region. This metric provides a means for meaningfully optimizing parameter selection when generating topologies intended to share structure with, but not match exactly, measured graphs.	graph (discrete mathematics);information;internet;network topology;problem domain	Damien Fay;Hamed Haddadi;Andrew W.

Researchers and early adopters need adequate SDNtesting facilities. Industry is responding with embeddedsupport for SDN in their enterprise grade networkhardware, but is cost prohibitive for many research testenvironments. An alternative is to use software simulatednetwork topology tools that arguably do not emulate realworldbehavior. Our solution is to build a low cost, portable, standaloneSDN testbed. Called SDN On-The-Go (OTG), the testbedsupports many configurations for pseudo real-world SDNexperiments. SDN OTG is a self-contained testbed thatcan also be used as a portable teaching device, moved fromclassroom to classroom or taken home for privateresearch. We achieved repeatability factor 10 timesgreater than simulation based testing. Our SDN OTGphysical testbed weighs about twenty pounds, costs aroundone thousand US dollars, provides repeatable data, andcan be setup as a fully functional SDN testbed in a coupleof minutes.	network topology;prototype;repeatability;simulation;software-defined networking;testbed;usb on-the-go	Joshua A.

80ea0f0c0b72cd6df0116f37575723abe2ff56af	frugal: building degree-constrained overlay topology from social graphs		Efficient and secure device to device communication is a necessary enabler for realization of fog and edge computing models. With an ever-increasing number, diversity, and geographical distribution of heterogeneous devices, ranging from pervasive sensor networks to edge cloudlets, the interconnection and network management of these devices emerges as a major challenge. Peer-to-peer (P2P) network overlays provide a scalable, decentralized and autonomous solution for interconnecting devices at the edge, and from the edge to the core of the cloud. This paper considers a networking system for edge computing that leverages trust embedded in online social networks (OSNs) to establish P2P overlays that offer the opportunity of private, authenticated device to device communications within the scope of a virtual private network (VPN). Mapping the social graph of OSNs onto an overlay network's topology presents challenges, since every social link that is mapped to an overlay has a cost associated with it, in terms of energy and resources consumed on link-setup and maintenance (especially for power-constrained devices). This paper addresses one key challenge in this context: dealing with high-degree social nodes. We propose a distributed mechanism - Frugal - that allows devices bound to a social user to make co-operative, but independent decisions to select social links to be mapped to overlay links. The approach leverages existing heuristics on computing minimum cost degree constrained spanning trees for graphs, but is novel in how it applies costs to graph edges using only local neighborhood information at each node, and how it operates in a distributed fashion. Simulation studies consider Frugal and two other policies (Greedy, Random) for capping the number of links in high-degree social nodes. Our simulation study carried out on social datasets indicates that significant degree reduction for high degree nodes/devices can be achieved without incurring major degradation in connectivity or performance loss in resulting overlay networks.	authentication;autonomous robot;bootstrapping (statistics);distance fog;edge computing;elegant degradation;embedded system;file spanning;frequency capping;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);hyperlink;interconnection;minimum spanning tree;online and offline;open-source software;overlay network;peer-to-peer;prototype;scalability;simulation;social graph;social network;virtual private network	Saumitra Aditya;Renato J.

The MSSR architecture overcomes scalabil ity and performance issues of single software router by prov iding parallel forwarding paths. Like many networking devices, a MSSR must be sized for peak tra ffic load, which implies energy inefficiency at low loads. Thus, we focus on energy saving schemes t o improve the router energy e fficiency by dynamically adapting the MSSR architecture to the currently o ffered load. We first introduce an optimal energy saving algori thm defined as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization mod el. Then, heuristic solutions, named di fferential algorithms are discussed. While the optimal approach provides higher energ y savings, the heuristics avoid the complete MSSR reconfigur ation, thus reducing forwarding delays and minimizing service int rruption. The performance evaluation shows that the propo sed heuristic algorithms, that gracefully modifies the internal MSSR confi guration, preserve the load proportional energy demand cha ra teristics of the optimal algorithm, with a minimal loss of e fficiency, largely compensated by algorithm simplicity.	algorithm;computer;data center;denial-of-service attack;entropy maximization;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;iterative method;knapsack problem;linear programming;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;np-hardness;networking hardware;performance evaluation;router (computing);scalability;sed;simulation;sorting;whole earth 'lectronic link	Andrea Bianco;Fikru Getachew Debele;Luca Giraudo	2014	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2014.02.013	real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;efficient energy use;computer network	Arch	-10.132805512710908	82.09106655198494	118599

In recognition of the increasing importance of advancing cloud services and technologies, especially for providing Internet services, the US National Science Foundation (NSF) established a project, the NSF Cloud initiative, to enable the computer science research community to develop and experiment with novel cloud architectures and create new, architecturally enabled innovative applications for cloud computing through empirical research experimentation by using large scale distributed cloud test beds. This paper provides an overview of one of those test beds, the Chameleon Cloud tested, with an additional description of the integration of that test bed with high programmable, high performance networks, based on SDN.

5373d704e2ebb888cf4bf16040b6f8282aaf913f	a new approach for fast segment-based protection in wdm mesh networks	segment based protection;wavelength division multiplexing wdm;mesh network;pre cross connected trails	We propose a new approach for developing segment-based schemes for protection against single link/node failure in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) mesh networks. In the proposed approach, every request is allocated a pair of link disjoint but most coupled primary and backup paths. Two paths are said to be most coupled if they share the maximum number of end nodes of some existing requests. Coupled paths reduce the total number of hops need to be traversed by a failure signal and, hence, potentially reduces the overall recovery time. We show that the problem of finding a pair of disjoint and most coupled paths is NP-complete. Accordingly, we propose an efficient and fast protection algorithm called SPXPâSegment Pre-Cross-Connected Protection, to allocate disjoint and most coupled paths. The proposed SPXP algorithm reduces the recovery time by ensuring that backup resources are preconfigured along each backup segment and, hence, is readily available upon a failure. Simulation results for different incremental traffic models and network topologies show that, for most cases, the proposed SPXP exhibits better performance in terms of blocking probability, resource usage, and recovery time compared with existing protection schemes.

We study the coexistence of human-to-human (H2H), e.g., triple-play traffic and machine-to-machine (M2M) traffic originating from wireless sensors operating on a wide range of possible configurations. Our analysis enables the quantification of the maximum achievable data rates of both event- and time-driven wireless sensors without violating given upper delay limits of H2H traffic. By using experimental measurements of real-world smart grid applications, we investigate the impact of variable H2H traffic loads on the sensor end-to-end delay performance. The obtained results show that a conventional Ethernet PON may cause a bottleneck and increase the delay for both H2H and M2M traffic. In contrast, by using a 10 G-EPON or wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) PON, the bottleneck arises in the wireless network. Furthermore, we study the interplay between time- and event-driven nodes and show that the theoretical upper bound of time-driven sensors decreases linearly as a function of the number of sensors, whereas with event-driven sensors, the upper bound decrease is nonlinear and more pronounced.	10g-epon;algorithm;bottleneck (engineering);coexist (image);end-to-end principle;ethernet in the first mile;event-driven finite-state machine;event-driven programming;machine to machine;mebibyte;multitier architecture;network packet;nonlinear system;passive optical network;performance evaluation;quality of service;routing;sensor;throughput;wavelength-division multiplexing	Martin LÃ©vesque;Frank Aurzada;Martin Maier;Geza Joos	2014	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2359885	telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-9.723321584437254	87.62225670753708	118732

0cbb268f31ba5532fd1d000c8046094eab5a8e87	high-speed software data plane via vectorized packet processing		In the last decade, a number of frameworks started to appear that implement, directly in userspace with kernel-bypass mode, high-speed software data plane functionalities on commodity hardware. Vector Packet Processor (VPP) is one of such frameworks, representing an interesting point in the design space in that it offers, in userspace networking, the flexibility of a modular router (Click and variants), with the benefits provided by techniques such as batch processing that have become commonplace in high-speed networking stacks (such as netmap or DPDK). Similarly to Click, VPP lets users arrange functions as a processing graph, providing a full-blown stack of network functions. However, unlike Click, where the whole tree is traversed for each packet, in VPP each traversed node processes all packets in the batch (called vector) before moving to the next node. This design choice enables several code optimizations that greatly improve the achievable processing throughput. This article introduces the main VPP concepts and architecture, and experimentally evaluates the impact of design choices (such as batch packet processing) on performance.

However, measuring these traffic matrices directly is difficult and costly. Hence many methods have been proposed to estimate these traffic matrices based on link load measurements and other more easily available data. This paper presents an iterative algorithm to estimate traffic matrix without differentiating the access links and the peering links and our algorithm get a similar performance with the Minimal Mutual Information method which requires that difference. Experiments on real backbone network data have also demonstrated that our algorithm is accurate and robust to measurement noise.	algorithm;internet backbone;iterative method;load balancing (computing);mutual information;peering;routing	Ke Liu;Xuesong Qiu;Zhipeng Gao;Xingyu Chen;Shuying Chang;Yuan Pang	2010	2010 International Conference on Network and Service Management	10.1109/CNSM.2010.5691194	traffic engineering;network engineering;computer science;load balancing;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;iterative method;tomography;routing protocol;computer network	HPC	-7.777239141686598	79.63977384912987	119299

However, the vast range of available services and the service on-demand model, creates dynamic traffic conditions that necessitates a flexible and automatic network platform to redirect traffic according to network conditions. In this paper, we study the problem of deploying service chains, consisting of a number of virtualized network functions (VNFs), in a SDN enabled data center network, where a random number of users are associated with each service chain. To this end, appropriate resource management algorithms are introduced for the placement of VNFs satisfying server affinity and latency constraints. The interconnection of the VNFs is facilitated by an SDN controller, which periodically recalculates the routing paths to adjust to the dynamic traffic conditions.	algorithm;data center;display resolution;heuristic;hypervisor;interconnection;load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;multitenancy;network function virtualization;performance evaluation;processor affinity;random number generation;redirection (computing);routing;semiconductor consolidation;server (computing);software deployment;software-defined networking;throughput	Aris Leivadeas;Matthias Falkner;Ioannis Lambadaris;George Kesidis	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842225	real-time computing;dynamic priority scheduling;network switch;computer science;linear programming;resource management;operating system;distributed computing;server;computer network	Networks	-12.386765017353875	82.25951404394033	119358

Mapping inter-domain traffic flows into existing service level agreements is, in general, a complex problem, for which some algorithms have recently been proposed in the literature. In this paper a two-phase algorithm to optimize the utilization of domain resources both from a technical perspective and a monetary costs perspective is proposed. The first phase is carried out by a greedy random algorithm, which returns a feasible solution. This is followed by an improvement phase performed by a genetic algorithm, which returns the optimal solution. Results show that the first phase produces quasi-optimal resource assignments for regional ISP and outer core autonomous systems (AS). For transit core and dense core AS, where the number of aggregate flows is considerably higher, the second phase leads to significant improvement.	aggregate data;aggregate function;autonomous system (internet);genetic algorithm;greedy algorithm;inter-domain;mathematical optimization;online and offline;quality of service;randomized algorithm;service-level agreement;two-phase commit protocol	Manuel Pedro;Edmundo Monteiro;Fernando Boavida	2005	Advanced Industrial Conference on Telecommunications/Service Assurance with Partial and Intermittent Resources Conference/E-Learning on Telecommunications Workshop (AICT/SAPIR/ELETE'05)	10.1109/AICT.2005.15	genetic algorithm;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	DB	-5.009465421983808	83.8973443208861	119445

In order to resolve these problems, many researchers start to design and implement innovative network architectures, which we call Future Internet. Most Future Internet projects in the world deploy OpenFlow technology developed by Stanford University in current network backbone to setup programmable Future Internet test beds. Currently, many international experiments have at least one controller for each organization in order to decrease overheads in single controller environment. In this paper, we study and implement real-time flow viewer across different domains based on the automatic network topology discovery system from our previous work. The real-time flow viewer can be used as a network management tool for validation of inter-domain flow assignment and observation of network activities across different domains.	discovery system;experiment;future internet;inter-domain;internet backbone;network topology;openflow;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time transcription	Wun-Yuan Huang;Jen-Wei Hu;Ta-Yuan Chou;Te-Lung Liu	2013	2013 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops	10.1109/WAINA.2013.67	openflow;the internet;computer science;operating system;data-flow analysis;graphical user interface;distributed computing;nox;world wide web;computer security;network topology;computer network	HPC	-16.8745264902792	83.18683895344614	119476

This necessitates ensuring a controlled network resource usage while decreasing connection blocking probability. However, optical networks are witnessing the introduction of an increasing number of new services, each having different requirements. As such, the evolution towards resource efficient connection setup management strategies that provide differentiated call-blocking probability becomes inevitable. Building on the previous observation, we propose in this paper a novel connection setup management strategy. This latter aims to differentiate the blocking probability among different classes of lightpath requests, while avoiding the starvation of the lower class lightpaths. The main idea behind our proposal is to privilige higher class lightpaths via preemption and to protect the lower class lightpaths through rerouting. In this manner, the proposed strategy serves the double objective of minimizing the overall connection blocking probability and of realizing quality of service (QoS) differentiation. The previous claim is asserted through our simulation results that gauge the main benefits behind our proposed connection setup strategy. The simulation results drawn from the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) and the European Optical Network (EON) show that the proposed strategy achieves both differentiated and low blocking probabilities.	blocking (computing);erlang (unit);national science foundation network;preemption (computing);quality of service;requirement;simulation	Wissam Fawaz;Ken Chen;Zahi Nakad;Chadi Abou-Rjeily	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.1003	algorithm design;quality management;index term;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;probability;statistics;profitability index;computer network	Robotics	-8.146089132376334	84.22960182207069	119504

The optical community has just started to venture into the application of network coding in optical networks. However, a number of challenges need to be overcome before network coding can be used in optical networks. These include limited buffering and processing capabilities as well as extremely coarse bandwidth granularity. In this paper, we address some of these problems. Finding multicast codes can be broken into two subproblems: finding a subgraph of the topology to code over and then finding an actual code for that subgraph. We show that the former problem is NP-Complete and provide heuristics which allow for coded multicast in optical wavelength division multiplexing networks which offer a modest improvement in bandwidth efficiency over traditional methods for finding routes for optical-layer multicast traffic.	code;effective method;file spanning;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);karp's 21 np-complete problems;linear network coding;minimum spanning tree;multicast;opto-electronic oscillator;programming paradigm;simulation;spectral efficiency;steiner tree problem;telecommunications network;wavelength-division multiplexing	Eric D.

Several dimensions in the process of identification, management and routing need to be handled to overcome the challenges associated with the management of CRNs. A very important topic in achieving an effective and flexible management solution is related to the data representation of the different CRN dimensions. Scalability, high tolerance to churn and low latencies in accessing the stored data are fundamental characteristics in order to keep up with the dynamic nature of a mobile environment. Accordingly, to achieve a robust data representation that can handle all these requirements in an efficient way we focus our attention on peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. These systems are well known for providing an efficient platform to develop scalable and robust applications. Hence, in this paper we investigate using geometric multi-dimensional data representation and addressing system based on basic CAN functionality. Results obtained in our experiments are reported, providing useful information to improve the resilience to churn of our system.	cognitive radio;computation;data (computing);experiment;fault tolerance;maximum power transfer theorem;peer-to-peer;performance evaluation;point of view (computer hardware company);requirement;routing;scalability;throughput;user (computing)	Alexandru Popescu;David Erman;Markus Fiedler;Demetres D.

This description is gained by employing local perception sensors mounted to the vehicle in order to measure distances and velocities of objects in the vehicleu0027s vicinity. Whereas todayu0027s vehicles solely depend on their on-board sensors, tomorrowu0027s vehicles will additionally be equipped with heterogeneous communication technologies with the aim of realizing cooperation among road participants. What is more, combining local perception sensors and Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) (collective perception) allows vehicles to share their mutual sensor dataresulting in an even more complete representation of a vehicleu0027s surrounding. Research in the area of heterogeneous cooperation between Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs) raises the need for an holistic simulation framework capable of answering a diverse set of questions. This contribution provides several extensions to the publicly available microscopic simulation framework Artery which itself is based on Veins: local perception sensors and a Long Term Evolution (LTE) communication stack. To demonstrate Arteryu0027s capabilities, we set up several simulation scenarios with heterogeneous network nodes (vehicles) to reproduce local traffic phenomena on an Original Equipment Manufactureru0027s backend.	compaq lte;holism;sensor;simulation	Hendrik-Jorn Gunther;Julian Timpner;Martin Wegner;Raphael Riebl;Lars C.

First, the latter is typically generated between dedicated node pairs that only require sufficient transmission bandwidth. Intra-DCN service requests, in contrast, require IT resources, such as computational, memory and storage resources, in addition to the transmission bandwidth. Second, for a given intra-DCN service request, any intra-DCN node that can provide the required IT resources can serve as a destination node (i.e., anycast). Thus, this type of network poses an important research problem of routing and spectrum/IT resource assignment (RSIA). To support these features, we first develop an integer linear programming (ILP) model to address the static RSIA problem, and then to propose efficient heuristic algorithms to address the dynamic RSIA issues, subject to the intra-DCNsâ limited network resources. The results of the proposed ILP model and heuristic algorithms are compared with the traditional network models and algorithms. It is found that the proposed ILP model and heuristic algorithms perform much better than the traditional approaches in terms of using intra-DCN network resources and reducing the service-request blocking probability.	algorithm;anycast;blocking (computing);data center;dynamic circuit network;erlang (unit);heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;routing	Limei Peng;Min Chen;Kiejin Park;Changhwan Youn	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2612651	mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	Metrics	-6.0348919688200615	82.94089219319991	120227

It is expected that, as telecommunication costs decrease, its adoption will become more and more prevailing. Current multihoming support is not designed to scale up to the expected number of multihomed sites, so alternative solutions are required, especially for IPv6. In order to preserve interdomain routing scalability, the new multihoming solution has to be compatible with Provider Aggregatable addressing. However, such addressing scheme imposes the configuration of multiple prefixes in multihomed sites, which in turn causes several operational difficulties within those sites that may even result in communication failures when all the ISPs are working properly. In this note we propose the adoption of Source Address Dependent routing within the multihomed site to overcome the identified difficulties.	addressing scheme;fault tolerance;ingress filtering;inter-domain;link-state routing protocol;multihoming;network packet;pa-risc;router (computing);scalability;software deployment	Marcelo Bagnulo;Alberto GarcÃ­a-MartÃ­nez;Juan RodrÃ­guez;Arturo Azcorra	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30193-6_24	fault tolerance;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Networks	-4.798928794397131	76.43080333755198	120245

A key aspect of the identifier/locator separation is to design an identifier-to-locator mapping service to map identifiers onto locators. Although several mapping services have been presented in previous works, they either are designed based on aggregable identifiers, or suffer from high resolution latency. That is, they hardly meet the demands of the future Internet, which is desired to support fast mapping and self-certifying flat identifiers. In this paper, we propose LMChord, a fast mapping service that is based on the idea of locality-aware and hierarchical Distributed Hash Table (DHT). To address the mismatch problem between overlay and physical network, we present the LMChord construction model, which models the LMChord construction process as a Markov decision process (MDP). Moreover, we present a Markov decision construction algorithm, which improves reinforcement learning to get the global optimal or near-optimal construction strategy. To further improve routing efficiency, we also modify the finger table to optimize the LMChordâs routing hops. We show that, besides the capability to support incremental deployment and flat identifiers, the mapping scheme is more scalable and has lower resolution latency.

Such topological dynamics are further exacerbated by the natural grouping behavior in mobileuserâs movement, which leads to frequentnetwork partitioning. Network partitioning poses significant challenges to the provisioning of central ized services in adhoc networks, since the partitioning disconnects many mobi le users from the central server. In this paper, we propose a collection of novel run-time algorithms that adaptively ensure the centralized serviceis available to all mobile nodes during network partitioning, while minimizin g the number of servers required. The network-wide service coverage is ach ieved by partition prediction and service replication on the servers, andassisted by distributed service selection on regular mobile nodes. Simula tion results show that our algorithms efficiently achieve guaranteed servicecoverage to all nodes. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no simila r pproaches that use partition prediction to adaptively provision centralized service in partitionable mobile ad-hoc networks.	algorithm;binary space partitioning;centralized computing;disk partitioning;hoc (programming language);network partition;network topology;provisioning;server (computing);simula	Karen H.

We propose the scalable interdomain IP multicast architecture in order to achieve IP multicast communications over the whole Internet. The proposed architecture provides methods to reduce the routing information. We define two kind of multicast addresses, which are called VMA (virtual multicast address) and MAR (multicast address for routing). The VMA is used to identify the multicast group in the intra-domain and MAR is used to forward multicast packets between the interdomain. With the definition of two multicast addresses, multicast address allocation can be more flexible, and routing information can be reduced with address aggregation. We estimate the amount of reduced routing information with our architecture, and evaluate the proposed architecture.	inter-domain;multicast	Motoyuki Ohmori;Koji Okamura;Keijiro Araki	2001		10.1109/ICOIN.2001.905591	reserved ip addresses;local management interface;multicast;the internet;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;telecommunications;information science;mbone;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;classful network;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;reverse path forwarding;transport layer;bandwidth;xcast;computer network;multicast address;unicast;ipv6 address	Networks	-7.0989325828785965	84.15644633935355	120685

Because of the huge number of nodes, connections, and circles in backbone network, the Force-directed Placement model which is form the physical system is brought in to optimize visualization. In this model, network topology is auto-layout by random initiation and iterative adjustments. The FR (Fruchterman and Reingold) algorithm is improved to make the algorithm more suitable for backbone network topology auto-layout. By reevaluated the force function, the types and numbers of nodes can be identified for dynamic configuration. The placement can be edited and partly locked, and the crowded nodes are controlled in practice. The improvements and optimizations make it more available and adaptive in various networks. All the experimental data are derived from automatic discovery, which are authentic and practical.	network topology	Yuan Gao;Dancheng Li;Chunyan Han;Zhiliang Zhu	2009		10.1109/HIS.2009.322	computer science;machine learning;distributed computing;engineering drawing;network topology;logical topology	EDA	-7.968107282115581	79.52938297354596	120850

In this paper, we propose a strategy for sparse placement of regenerators in translucent optical networks named as Computation of Locations of Regenerator nodes (CLR). We analyze the effectiveness of our approach for large WDM networks. Simulation results show that our scheme CLR produces remarkable better results in terms of number of sparsely placed regenerator nodes and blocking probability when compared with the existing heuristic. Scheme CLR is also able to provide a route between any source-destination pair and thus solve RRP (Routing with Regenerator Problem) while utilizing lesser number of channels (maximum value) in each optical fiber.	algorithm;blocking (computing);computation;erlang (unit);heuristic;mike lesser;network congestion;optical fiber;requirement;routing;signal regeneration;simulation;sparse matrix;wavelength-division multiplexing	Ira Nath;Monish Chatterjee;Uma Bhattacharya	2015	2015 Twelfth International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks (WOCN)	10.1109/WOCN.2015.8064490	computer network;optical fiber;computation;repeater;computer science;distributed computing;communication channel;wavelength-division multiplexing	EDA	-5.756627881718414	83.01013771732708	120927

Recently, several schemes have been proposed for address allocation in pure MANET environment, but they do not consider the access requirement of mobile nodes to the global Internet. In this paper, we consider the hybrid MANET where the pure MANET is interconnected to the external Internet by some gateways. For global-scope address allocation in this hybrid MANET, we present a new address allocation scheme by modifying the IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration protocol. The proposed protocol decreases the latency of address allocation period by enhancing the duplicate address detection (DAD) mechanism of the address autoconfiguration protocol.	auto-configuration;hoc (programming language);link-local address;stateless protocol	Il-kyun Park;Young Han Kim;Sang-san Lee	2004	Second IEEE Workshop on Software Technologies for Future Embedded and Ubiquitous Systems, 2004.

A novel restoration approach is introduced to repair the failed MVNs while maintaining their quality of service requirements (e.g., end-to-end delay and delay variations). This approach relies on reducing the search region and exploiting nodes ranking and filtering (NRF) techniques to speed up the recovery process of finding an alternative node to which to migrate. The performance is extensively evaluated against multiple failures, with and without NRF, compared with complete re-embedding technique, link failure algorithms for single link failure, and previous work for single node failure. Simulation results prove that our recovery technique achieves good restoration ratio in considerably fast execution time, low link mapping cost (gain) with a slight impact on the admission ratio.	algorithm;backup;circuit restoration;end-to-end principle;multicast;non-functional requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);scalability;simulation;virtual machine	Abdulaziz M.

More and more things, generating huge data, will come into and enrich our lives, and the Web of Things (WoT) as a guide allows these things to be part of the World Wide Web (WWW), by using various data analysis services on the WWW. However, based on our observation on the image recognition and searching service of Baidu, pure image data transmission costs hundreds of milliseconds, besides the time of connection establishment. Inspired by the emerging Edge Computing, we analyzed the relationship between time consumption and different service provider's locations, as well as different initial congestion windows of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which affect web-based services' performance. Based on our experiments in different scenarios (i.e., initial congestion window, speed of connection device and server location), we found that pushing services to the edge of network and increasing initial congestion window, both of them can reduce latency on connection establishment and data transmission, especially when users are traveling at a high speed.

End-to-end waveband switching (ETE-WBS) and same-destination-intermediate waveband switching (SD-IT-WBS) are analyzed and compared in terms of blocking probability and cost savings. First, an analytical model for ETE-WBS is proposed to determine the network blocking probability in a mesh network. For SD-IT-WBS, a simple waveband switching algorithm is presented. An analytical model to determine the network blocking probability is proposed for SD-IT-WBS based on the algorithm. The analytical results are validated by comparing with simulation results. Both results match well and show that ETE-WBS slightly outperforms SD-IT-WBS in terms of blocking probability. On the other hand, simulation results show that SD-IT-WBS outperforms ETE-WBS in terms of cost savings.	algorithm;blocking (computing);end-to-end principle;erlang (unit);frequency band;internet backbone;mesh networking;simulation;wavelength-division multiplexing;work breakdown structure	Mengke Li;Wang Yao;Byrav Ramamurthy	2005	IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2005.

However, the cost of complete probing can be as high as O(n/sup 2/), which is prohibitive in large-scale overlay networks. Recently we proposed a method that trades probing overhead for inference accuracy in sparse networks such as the Internet. The method uses physical path information to infer path quality for all of the n/spl times/(n-1) overlay paths, while actually probing only a subset of the paths. We propose and evaluate a distributed approach to implement this method. We describe a minimum diameter, link-stress bounded overlay spanning tree, which is used to collect and disseminate path quality information. All nodes in the tree collaborate to infer the quality of all paths. Simulation results show this approach can achieve a high-level of inference accuracy while reducing probing overhead and balancing link stress on the spanning tree.	algorithm;approximation;file spanning;high- and low-level;internet;load balancing (computing);network topology;overhead (computing);overlay network;simulation;spanning tree;sparse matrix	Chiping Tang;Philip K.

This paper presents a multiple-failure recovery scheme that considers the operation and management of optical paths. The presented scheme employs scheme escalation from pre-planned restoration to full rerouting. First, the survivability of this scheme against multiple failures is evaluated considering operational constraints such as route selection, resource allocation, and the recovery order of failed paths. The evaluation results show that scheme escalation provides a high level of survivability even under operational constraints, and this paper quantitatively clarifies the impact of these various operational constraints. In addition, the fundamental functions of the scheme escalation are implemented in the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching control plane and verified in an optical-cross-connect-based network.	generalized multi-protocol label switching;optical mesh network;privilege escalation	Yoshiaki Sone;Wataru Imajuku;Naohide Nagatsu;Masahiko Jinno	2009	IEICE Transactions		optical path;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;implementation;computer security;telecommunications network;optical cross-connect	Vision	-9.022126595448437	84.26388378150301	121534

Automatically switched optical networks and generalized multiprotocol label switching control planes are promising functionalities to achieve the sophisticated mechanism of interdomain traffic engineering. In this article we address dynamic operational scenarios to control IP traffic flows using the ASON/GMPLS control plane. This includes cut-through IP/MPLS routers and the rerouting of failed links through the tunnel of optical label-switched paths. This article presents an operational evaluation of traffic engineering. More specifically, we present QoS recovery for protecting high priority traffic using policy controllers and fault recovery of inter-domain LSPs over the JGN II network testbed. This article evaluates and discusses the feasibility of these operational scenarios using state-of-the-art optical switching and control- plane technologies.	automatically switched optical network;control plane;generalized multi-protocol label switching;inter-domain;internet backbone;layer 2 mpls vpn;multiprotocol label switching;optical switch;priority queue;testbed	Atsushi Taniguchi;Yasunori Sameshima;Shuichi Okamoto;Yukifusa Okano;Yukio Tsukishima;Wataru Imajuku	2008	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2008.4511650	automatically switched optical network;multiprotocol label switching;routing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;optical fiber;synchronous optical networking;traffic flow;backbone network;distributed computing;optical switch;adaptive optics;optical amplifier;computer network	Networks	-9.315120192868028	84.53003289741122	121563

The most efficient algorithms proposed so far define link and node mappings as optimal solutions of Integer Programming (IP) problems. They exhibit reasonably good performance only for small problem instance sizes, including few tens of nodes and links per physical substrate, few nodes and links per virtual request and a dozen of virtual requests to handle in parallel. However, we find these instances too small to be of any practical use. To address this scalability issue, we propose VNetMapper, an algorithm to solve the virtual network embedding problem based on an integer program formulation with appropriately selected objective function, variables and the set of constraints tuned to give an optimal performance. We show through simulations that VNetMapper can quickly, within seconds, solve large problem instances, involving physical substrates with hundreds of nodes and thousands of links and batches of hundreds of virtual network requests. By identifying exact properties that make VNetMapper so fast and scalable, we present guidelines for designing scalable integer programs.	algorithm;integer programming;linear programming;loss function;norm (social);optimization problem;scalability;simulation;x86 virtualization	Zoran Despotovic;Artur Hecker;Ahsan Naveed Malik;Riccardo Guerzoni;Ishan Vaishnavi;Riccardo Trivisonno;Sergio Beker	2014	2014 23rd International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2014.6911859	real-time computing;computer science;virtual machine;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-11.43133915435896	81.67572423938452	121701

In this paper, we attempt to improve the performance of VNE in terms of acceptance ratio of Virtual Network (VN) requests by considering resource fragmentation in a substrate network. Different from existing work, we involve a new metric called Resource Fragmentation Degree (RFD) to quantitatively measure the status of resource fragmentation at substrate nodes and links. The definition of RFD is derived from the conception of connectivity in graph theory. Actually, RFD of a node (or a link) is only determined by residual resources at its neighbor nodes and adjacent links. Thus it can be derived efficiently. For a node (or a link), maximum RFD is reached when either all of its neighbor nodes or all of its adjacent links are running out of resources. In this case, resources at the node (or the link) are entirely fragmented. With consideration of RFD, we then formulate the problem of VNE as a mixed integer program. The optimization objective includes minimizing fragmented resources indicated by RFD in the substrate network. Finally, an online algorithm called VNE-RFD is proposed to solve the problem. Simulation results show that VNE-RFD can effectively reduce resource fragmentation and thus accept more VN requests compared with some existing algorithms.	complexity;fragmentation (computing);graph theory;integer programming;linear programming;loss function;mathematical optimization;online algorithm;optimization problem;quantization (signal processing);simulation	Xing Li;Hancheng Lu;Wei Zhou;Peilin Hong	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037076	computer science;resource management;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;bandwidth;measurement;statistics;computer network	HPC	-8.47347398228058	82.49768181304931	121709

We propose a method for evaluating DHTs by emulator, which allows us to evaluate not only DHT algorithms but also DHT implementations. Evaluating DHT implementations is important for DHT application developers because their performance influences application design. We developed a DHT emulator that runs in a local environment, and controls several DHT implementations based on a scenario. Because a scenario allows us to repeat evaluations, we can compare DHTs by one scenario and find behavior patterns by slightly changed scenarios. Five use cases are demonstrated to show the capabilities of Peeremu, and some results show DHT characteristics that cannot be obtained by simulating DHT algorithms. We hope this method helps application developers to understand DHTs and utilize them to create a better user experience. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper focuses on the interactions of the component protocols to understand their behavior in network failure and recovery scenarios. We consider a multicast environment based on the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) routing protocol, the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol. Analytical models are presented to describe the interplay of all of these protocols in various multicast channel recovery scenarios. Quantitative results for the recovery time of IP multicast channels are given as references for network configurations, and protocol development. Simulation models are developed using the OPNET simulation tool to measure the fault recovery time and the associated protocol control overhead, and study the influence of important protocol parameters. A testbed with five Cisco routers is configured with PIM, OSPF, and IGMP to measure the multicast channel failure and recovery times for a variety of different link and router failures. In general, the failure recovery is found to be lightweight in term of control overhead and recovery time. Failure recovery time in a WAN is found to be dominated by the unicast protocol recovery process. Failure recovery in a LAN is more complex, and strongly influenced by protocol interaction and implementation specifics. Suggestion for improvement of the failure recovery time via protocol enhancements, parameter tuning, and network configuration are provided.	multicast	Xin Wang;C. Yu;Henning Schulzrinne;Paul A.

Despite its benefits, NDN brings several challenges like the design of novel data caching policies and efficient interest forwarding schemes (i.e., content look-up). In this paper, we survey the main NDN forwarding schemes proposed in the literature and classify them. We also conduct extensive simulations to evaluate and compare their performance in terms of throughput, mean download time, cache hit ratio and interest overhead. We finally discuss the simulation results and highlight the pros and cons of the existing strategies.	cpu cache;cache (computing);download;hit (internet);internet;lookup table;overhead (computing);simulation;throughput	Narjes Aloulou;Mouna Ayari;Mohamed Faten Zhani;LeÃ¯la SaÃ¯dane;Guy Pujolle	2017	2017 Sixth International Conference on Communications and Networking (ComNet)	10.1109/COMNET.2017.8285592	computer network;the internet;throughput;architecture;cache;scalability;computer science;cons;server;download	Mobile	-14.711957740726826	75.40935128359244	122072

The first part depicts this multiservice ubiquitous infrastructure anchored on a clean separation between a transport/network domain and a service/application domain. Then a unified NGN control and management architecture, mainly inspired by the past and current IP QoS architectures, is proposed. In a second part, starting from this model and through a critical analysis of current DVB-S/RCS satellite systems, we demonstrate that satellite QoS architectures are not mature enough to support broadband access to future multimedia services and to integrate into the emerging NGN infrastructure. In order to cope with these issues, a NGNcompliant QoS architecture for DVB-S/RCS systems is defined. It relies on a cross-layer approach based on a tight interaction between QoS mechanisms available at different communication layers (Application, Session, Network and MAC). It aims at maximizing satellite capacity utilization at different granularity levels through a relevant configuration of DiffServ services using session/application signalling information and the use of optimized bandwidth on demand allocation schemes at the MAC layer. Application solutions (QoS Agent and QoS SIP Proxy) were developed while the satellite network with its associated QoS architecture was implemented through a network emulator. This latter enables us to evaluate the QoS guarantees provided by this architecture and to validate its appropriateness with real multimedia applications needs.	atm adaptation layer 5;atm turbo;access network;accessible surface area;anomaly detection;application domain;bibliothÃ¨que de l'Ã©cole des chartes;boomerang;bridging (networking);cops (software);carlson's theorem;columbia (supercomputer);common access card;common open policy service;communications of the acm;communications satellite;computational model;control plane;dvb-s;datacasting;datagram;dave grossman (game developer);differentiated services;digital video broadcasting;dynamic resolution adaptation;esa;earliest deadline first scheduling;edwin e. tozer;emulator;end-to-end principle;enterprise architecture framework;framing (social sciences);functional specification;furby;gary kimura;geosynchronous satellite;h.262/mpeg-2 part 2;hall-effect thruster;hardware description language;hypertext transfer protocol;ibm notes;ieee 1471;ieee internet computing;ip multimedia subsystem;ipsec;itil;impossible is nothing (video rÃ©sumÃ©);imrich chlamtac;integrated services;inter-domain;international federation for information processing;internet access;internet protocol suite;iperf3;item unique identification;kphone;ka band;key exchange;large eddy simulation;linear algebra;list of minor characters in the matrix series;local area augmentation system;mpeg-2;microsoft windows;ming li;mitchell corporation;modulation;multicast;multiprotocol encapsulation;multitier architecture;network architecture;network congestion;network packet;network performance;next steps in signaling;next-generation network;nichols plot;nix package manager;norm (social);nouvelle ai;octal;on-board data handling;openbsm;operating system;per-hop behaviour;performance evaluation;performance-enhancing proxy;peterson's algorithm;phelim boyle;provisioning;proxy server;quality of service;real-time computing;real-time transcription;recueil des historiens des croisades;resource reservation protocol;revision control system;sans institute;second generation multiplex plus;session description protocol;source-to-source compiler	Olivier Alphand	2005			geography;telecommunications;computer security;cartography	Networks	-18.10563712694075	87.82398786149616	122205

The objective is to efficiently route connection requests with fractional wavelength capacity requirements onto high-capacity wavelengths and balance the load on the links in the network at the same time. To do so, we propose a cost function, which not only encourages grooming new connection requests onto the wavelengths that are being used by existing traffic, but also performs load balancing by intelligently increasing the cost of using wavelengths on links. The performance results obtained by experiments on a representative sized mesh network show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms.	algorithm;blocking (computing);experiment;heuristic (computer science);json-wsp;load balancing (computing);loss function;mesh networking;online and offline;optical mesh network;requirement;routing;time complexity;toad data modeler;wavelength-division multiplexing	Arun Vishwanath;Weifa Liang	2005	Sixth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Applications and Technologies (PDCAT'05)	10.1109/PDCAT.2005.176	switched mesh;traffic grooming;telecommunications;computer science;mesh networking;shared mesh;computer network	HPC	-5.508702019796117	83.33756844932324	123024

Network resources are aggregated by the residential access gateway using the 802.11 radio interface to simultaneously serve home users and to share the broadband connectivity with neighboring access gateways. Differently from previous works, our aggregation scheme is transparent both for local users, who are not required to modify their applications or device drivers, and for neighboring users, who do not experience any meaningful performance degradation. The proposed approach aims at a commercial deployment, leveraging on existing access gateways and ADSL-based access networks.

Centralized TE is impractical when the network becomes too large in size or in loading. Zone-based hierarchical TE comes into play under this circumstance, where the TE problem is decomposed into sub problems related to zones and tackled collectively by local zone controllers. As an integral part of this TE approach, zoning was studied in a very limited context. Existing solutions generate geographic zones and suit only arc-model TE optimization. In this paper, we advance the state of the art by proposing logical zones to support path-model TE optimization. Logical zones are created by coupling traffic flows to zone controllers. We mathematically formulate the zoning problem in different cases, where the number of available controllers is equal to, or larger than that of zones required. These problems are NP hard. We develop novel heuristic solutions and present comparative simulation study.	centralized computing;control plane;floor and ceiling functions;forwarding plane;heuristic;mathematical optimization;np (complexity);np-hardness;problem solving;simulation;software-defined networking;test engineer	Xu Li;Hang Zhang	2015	2015 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2015.7069497	real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	DB	-10.786366181032314	82.4178513371774	124104

The capacity of each edge is assumed to be deterministic in this problem. However, in many real-life networks such as computer, telecommunication, logistics networks, etc., each edge should be multistate due to failure, maintenance, etc. Such a network is named a multistate network. Hence, the minimum transmission time through a multistate network is not fixed. We evaluate the system reliability that a specified amount of data can be sent through a pair of minimal paths simultaneously within the time threshold. A solution procedure is first proposed to calculate it. In order to boost the system reliability, the network administrator decides the routing policy in advance to indicate the first and the second priority pairs of minimal paths. The second one will be responsible for the transmission duty if the first one fails. According to the routing policy, the system reliability can be subsequently computed. The case to transmit data through more than two minimal paths can be extended easily. 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	computer;logistics;real life;routing	Yi-Kuei Lin	2012	Expert Syst.

To effectively support IoT-Cloud services, it is essential to maintain persistent data transport between IoT and Cloud. Also the emerging Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm can assist flexible flow-centric networking of persistent data between IoT and Cloud. Thus, in this paper, we take an example of IoT-Cloud service realized over miniaturized IoT-SDN-Cloud environment (named as SmartX-mini Playground) and propose the application of SDN-based flow steering to dynamically adjust the overlay data paths for IoT-Cloud services. More specifically, we attempt to combine the overlay data transport of Apache Kafka messages and the underlay flow-based networking coordinated by an ONOS (Open Networking Operating System) SDN controller.	apache kafka;cloud computing;operating system;platform as a service;programming paradigm;software-defined networking	Heebum Yoon;Seungryong Kim;Taekho Nam;JongWon Kim	2017	2017 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2017.7899572	computer science;world wide web;computer security;internet of things;computer network	HPC	-15.442669412442422	83.04795345837383	124357

Then we propose a new router offload method with an optical flow switch (OFS) based on LCoS (Liquid Crystal on Silicon) technologies. With the significant increase in broadband new services on the Internet, we can use this OFS router offload strategy to separate IP traffic smartly to allow the small packet traffic to be transferred with the existing IP network transmission and the larger packet flows such as photos and video data to be transferred using our proposed OFS method. The proposed 16 Ã 16 OFS using LCoS technologies without optical buffers can quickly transfer the big data to the output ports. The main purpose of OFS is that it can provide a new solution to solve high speed transmission requirements as an efficient router offload strategy. The router offload strategy with an OFS method can also be used in the all-optical content delivery network which is composed of OFSs for a large amount of photos and video data transmissions in the future.	algorithm design;big data;content delivery network;digital distribution;liquid crystal on silicon;mega man network transmission;network packet;optical flow;passive optical network;requirement;round-robin scheduling;router (computing);scheduling (computing);software-defined networking	Yuh-Jiuh Cheng;Yhi Shiau;Shu-Ying Cheng	2015	2015 17th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)	10.1109/APNOMS.2015.7275359	embedded system;large segment offload;telecommunications;computer science;optical switch;optical cross-connect;computer network	Metrics	-7.353375206234004	87.5272657868493	125100

The development of wireless mobile devices with enhanced features have further fueled this phenomenon. While such content sharing in Internet is accommodated through an overlay architecture, for infrastructure-less environment such as wireless mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) experiencing intermittent connectivity, the distribution mechanism is not that straightforward. Arising from inherent MANET limitations such as short radio transmission range, sporadic node densities and constrained power, intermittent connectivity limits the ability of the network to provide successful content delivery. Although some solutions have been proposed in literature, they fail to consider the mobility characteristics of nodes for making decisions regarding the caching of contents for future delivery. Moreover, user-centric service requirements are also not addressed where different subscribers prefer different content profiles. To address this issue, a novel content sharing framework with optimized caching strategy is proposed in this paper. Based on the cached subscription profiles, the framework exploits two decision-making technologies namely analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and grey relational analysis (GRA) to evaluate all possible content requests between two meeting nodes and subsequently request the preferred contents for future encounters. Simulation results validate the improved performance of the proposed distribution framework in comparison to the existing schemes.	analytical hierarchy;cpu cache;cache (computing);digital distribution;grey relational analysis;hoc (programming language);internet;mobile device;mobile phone;requirement;simulation	Yaozhou Ma;M.

To assess the suitability of the possible paths, their QoS metrics which indicate the available resources, should be computed. The QoS metrics can be computed on-demand after the arrival of a QoS connection request or precomputed. On-demand path computation is superior to path precomputation in that suitable paths may be determined using most up to date network state. However, the delay incurred in determining a suitable path on demand may be unacceptable. Path precomputation overcomes the drawback of long delay of on-demand path computation. In addition, path precomputation may be preferred over on-demand path computation for scalability issues, when the number of expected QoS connection requests is very large. Typically, path precomputation needs to be performed frequently, for different routing problems, and from each source node to every possible destination node, which causes excessive consumption of resources. The overheads associated with typical on-demand and path precomputation techniques become unacceptable when routing inter-domain connections, and hence these techniques have been used almost exclusively in the context of intra-domain connections. The present paper describes an effective QoS provisioning technique which integrates path computation and precomputation intelligently in order to exploit the advantages offered by both these approaches. A novel reverse path precomputation technique which reduces the overheads associated with the precomputation process is also described. The presented QoS provisioning technique is suitable for provisioning both intra-domain and inter-domain connections.	bounce address;computation;inter-domain;precomputation;provisioning;quality of service;routing;scalability	Hanan H.

Indeed, it is widely accepted that the unstoppable growth of Internet users is producing two well-known problems: (1) depletion of addresses, motivated by a design limitation of the currently deployed addressing scheme, and (2) the semantic overload of addresses. The main negative consequences of these problems may be summarized as: (i) exacerbating the geometrical growth of the routing tables, and (ii) affecting other network features, such as traffic engineering and mobility, in terms of resilience and disruption tolerant communications. The relevant consequences that addressing brings to the overall network operation is pushing the networking community to study and propose new addressing architectures that may limit or even remove the negative effects (affecting network performance) stemmed from the currently deployed addressing architecture. To this end, researchers working on this area must have a perfect understanding of the weaknesses and limitations coming up from the nowadays architecture as well as a comprehensive knowledge of the alternatives proposed so far along with the most appealing research trends. Aligned to this scenario, this paper comes up with the aim of assisting the reader to both: (i) get insights about the most prominent limitations of the currently deployed addressing architecture, and (ii) survey the existing proposals based on ID/Locator Split Architectures (ILSAs) including an analysis of pros and cons, as well as a taxonomy aiming at formulating a design space for evaluating and designing existing and future ILSAs. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, introducing this technique also has disadvantages. If some subscribers leave the network, the brokers which aggregate subscriptions should re-configure the subscription aggregation strategy with its descendants. During this period false-positive publications, which are no longer needed by subscribers, are still propagated into the network. Therefore, it becomes paramount to examine the issue of how to conserve network resources through subscription aggregation, while simultaneously minimizing the false positive publication propagation. In this paper, we first prove the above problem is NP-hard. Then, we provide the dynamic programming approach when the re-configuration delay can be regarded as constant time. In the general case, we propose a greedy algorithm, and the corresponding performance bound is analyzed. Finally, we propose an overlay construction scheme to further fit the subscription aggregation. Extensive experimental results show that proposed algorithms achieve a good performance.	aggregate data;dynamic programming;greedy algorithm;np-hardness;publishâsubscribe pattern;routing table;software propagation;time complexity	Ning Wang;Jie Wu	2016	2016 25th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2016.7568544	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	DB	-7.546510372384467	81.37762954043689	125536

Traditional wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) networks do not support the all-optical splitting of signals to multiple output ports as required by point-to-multipoint communication schemes. Previous work has proposed an overlay approach known as Manycasting with Drop at Member Node (MA-DMN) to provide manycast support as a logical overlay to basic point-to-point lightpath connections. This approach has been studied extensively and compared to alternative overlay models, and has emerged the obvious candidate for supporting manycast overlays. Throughout its evaluation though, MA-DMN has never been scrutinized in terms of its costs for energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this work, we subject MA-DMN to these evaluations, while also proposing a new more energy-conservative emission-aware variant known as MA-DMN using Least Impact Trees (MA-DMN-LIT). We compare these two approaches by simulating realistic quantities of dynamic traffic, and uniformly distributing renewable energy sources to power nodes throughout the network. We find that MA-DMN-LIT reduces energy consumption over MA-DMN by 6-10% across the network, while also reducing CO2 emissions by as much as 27%. We further conclude that MA-DMN-LIT also provides lower connection blocking by not over-subscribing shorter paths in the network as its emission-blind counterpart does.	algorithm;blocking (computing);clean;decision model and notation;hardware overlay;heart rate variability;heuristic (computer science);image stitching;moving-average model;multipoint ground;overlay network;point-to-point protocol;point-to-multipoint communication;point-to-point (telecommunications);point-to-point construction;programming paradigm;scalability;simulation;unicast;wavelength-division multiplexing	Thilo Schondienst;Jeremy Plante;Dylan A.

It integrates the control and data layer functions developed in the project into a harmonized mobile network architecture, applying the paradigms of adaptive (de-) composition and allocation of network functions (NFs), programmable network control, and end-to-end network slicing. The paper depicts the design of a multi-service management & orchestration layer with dedicated interfaces for mobile network tenants. The security threats arising in virtualized multi-tenant networks are discussed and novel security solutions are presented. The architecture verification applies a methodology with three evaluation cases and the generic 5G services (eMBB, mMTC, and URLLC) to analyze to what extent the current architecture design meets the different requirements as defined in 5G NORMA and the overall ecosystem, including the 5G-PPP initiative and 3GPP.	ecosystem;end-to-end principle;entity;iteration;multitenancy;network architecture;norma;orchestration (computing);quality of service;requirement;systems architecture	Christian Mannweiler;Markus Breitbach;Heinz Droste;Ignacio Labrador PavÃ³n;IÃ±aki Ucar;Peter Schneider;Mark Doll;Jorge Rivas Sanchez	2017	2017 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)	10.1109/EuCNC.2017.7980662	network architecture;reference architecture;open network architecture;architecture;systems architecture;computer network;applications architecture;mobile computing;solution architecture;computer science;distributed computing	Mobile	-15.34338400657654	85.5154154624703	126105

We present two enhancements to GMPLS signaling which allow a dynamically bidirectional lightpath setup to be requested over a unidirectional ring. These new distributed signaling schemes introduce a new concept of the label contention problem applied at wavelength sets. The paper presents and compares new strategies of label contention policies for wavelength sets, providing a significant improvement in performance evaluated in the GMPLS control plane of the EMPIRICO project testbed.	automatically switched optical network;blocking (computing);control plane;erlang (unit);generalized multi-protocol label switching;metro (design language);optical add-drop multiplexer;provisioning;real-time clock;scsi rdma protocol;simple update protocol;testbed;wavelength-division multiplexing;wireless routing protocol	RaÃºl MuÃ±oz;Ricardo MartÃ­nez;Jordi Sorribes;Gabriel Junyent	2004	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2004.

However, existing solutions such as the commonly used independent model and Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) model do not accurately reflect the correlation between IP link failures, and thus may not choose reliable backup paths. We propose a cross-layer approach for minimizing routing disruption caused by IP link failures. We develop a probabilistically correlated failure (PCF) model to quantify the impact of IP link failure on the reliability of backup paths. With the PCF model, we propose an algorithm to choose multiple reliable backup paths to protect each IP link. When an IP link fails, its traffic is split onto multiple backup paths to ensure that the rerouted traffic load on each IP link does not exceed the usable bandwidth. We evaluate our approach using real ISP networks with both optical and IP layer topologies. Experimental results show that two backup paths are adequate for protecting a logical link. Compared with existing works, the backup paths selected by our approach are at least 18 percent more reliable and the routing disruption is reduced by at least 22 percent. Unlike prior works, the proposed approach prevents the rerouted traffic from interfering with normal traffic.	algorithm;backup;denial-of-service attack;emoticon;internet protocol suite;olpc xo;programming computable functions;routing;schema (genetic algorithms)	Qiang Zheng;Guohong Cao;Thomas F.

Their performance is driven by the overlay topology, i.e., the virtual topology that peers use to exchange video chunks. Several proposals have been made in the past to optimize it, yet few experimental studies have corroborated results. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive experimental comparison based on PeerStreamer in order to benchmark different strategies for the construction and maintenance of the overlay topology in P2P-TV systems. We present only experimental results in which fully distributed strategies are evaluated in both controlled experiments and the Internet using thousands of peers. Results confirm that the topological properties of the overlay have a deep impact on both user quality of experience and network load. Strategies based solely on random peer selection are greatly outperformed by smart yet simple and actually implementable strategies. The most performing strategy we devise guarantees to deliver almost all chunks to all peers with a playout delay as low as 6 s even when system load approaches 1, and in almost adversarial network scenarios. PeerStreamer is open-source to make results reproducible and allow further research by the community.	benchmark (computing);digital video;experiment;internet;load (computing);network topology;open-source software;peer-to-peer;playout;real-time locating system;streaming media	Stefano Traverso;Luca Abeni;Robert Birke;Csaba KirÃ¡ly;Emilio Leonardi;Renato Lo Cigno;Marco Mellia	2015	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2014.2307157	benchmark;the internet;overlay network;computer science;distributed computing;world wide web;network topology;bandwidth;measurement;computer network	OS	-13.429871112459992	78.30096871038018	126573

The bundle link technique is widely used in current core networks to provide higher bandwidth and more resilience. Basically a bundle link is composed of several high-speed physical sublinks which could be SONET connections, Ethernet circuits, etc. in order to make them work together as a virtual connection. In current network operations, all of the sublinks are activated if the bundle link is powered on although the sublinks could be shut down or brought up independently. Smartly and dynamically shutting down and bringing up sublinks and their attached ports according to the traffic demand or estimation could greatly increase the link utilization and save a large amount of energy. In previous work, we proposed a local heuristic threshold-based method to explore the potential energy savings in core networks by adjusting the number of active sublinks in the bundle links. In this paper, we further explore the possibilities to reach a better tradeoff between energy-saving performance and congestion risk by setting different value combinations of two parameters: the utilization threshold and sublink-adding strategy. From that, we propose a dynamic and hybrid local heuristic threshold-based algorithm, which we call HDLHT algorithm, to achieve a better tradeoff between energy-savings and congestion risk. In HDLHT algorithm, the bundle links are given different combinations of these two parameters according to the burstiness of their traffic. A simulation experiment deploying HDLHT algorithm was conducted on a synthetic network and the results show that HDLHT can greatly reduce the number of congestion occurrences with limited decrease in energy savings.	algorithm;algorithm design;heuristic;ibm notes;network congestion;router (computing);simulation;synchronous optical networking;synthetic intelligence;virtual circuit	Lin Liu;Byrav Ramamurthy	2013	Optical Switching and Networking	10.1016/j.osn.2013.01.003	distributed algorithm;bin packing problem;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;load balancing;distributed computing	Metrics	-9.382410731469754	82.23589427049981	126735

401a850b2ebdd1c6c3ed49ebe26b0ca773e87572	tablevisor 2.0: towards full-featured, scalable and hardware-independent multi table processing		Modern Software Defined Networking (SDN) applications rely on sophisticated packet processing. However, there is a mismatch between control plane requirements and data plane capabilities caused by increasing hardware heterogeneity. To overcome this challenge, we propose TableVisor, a proxy-layer for the OpenFlow control channel that enables the flexible and scalable abstraction of multiple physical devices into one emulated data plane switch that meets the requirements of the control plane application.

0262f16a0e8ea1bdb108551a3cfbfbfb694c0096	load balancing of communication channels with the use of routing protocols		In the article the authors propose a method for load-balancing of network resources for the case which uses a routing protocols. In the first part of the article the authors present currently used algorithms for load balancing and possibilities of their modification. Through the introduction of additional hardware components for each node: the agent and the probe; it is possible to monitor and control the current system performance. The whole analyzed network is treated as a complex system. This allows to eliminate overloading of route nodes (through ongoing analysis of the optimal operating point for a given node). Load balancing can be achieved using a modified mechanism of ECMP. The proposed approach allows for dynamic adjustment of load to network resources and thus effectively to balance network traffic.	algorithm;complex system;equal-cost multi-path routing;function overloading;load balancing (computing);network traffic control;operating point	Franciszek Grabowski;Marek Bolanowski;Andrzej Paszkiewicz	2014	Annales UMCS, Informatica		network load balancing;policy-based routing;routing table;routing domain;network load balancing services;routing;static routing;real-time computing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	HPC	-8.922116252433659	79.84839547856298	127229

The concern for QoS guaranties has been widely expressed in the past for both wired and wireless networks. However, only recently when these two types of networks have converged into one, thus making one huge heterogeneous system called M2M, new concerns have emerged. In this paper we measured energy consumption for different communication technologies and proposed an energy consumption model for iOS devices that can be used in future QoS specifications. Finally, we defined a QoS metric that includes both energy and time consumption aspects of one simple M2M service.	heterogeneous computing;machine to machine;provisioning;quality of service;ios	Stjepko Zrncic;Iva Bojic;Damjan Katusic;Pavle Skocir;Mario Kusek;Gordan Jezic	2013	2013 21st International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks - (SoftCOM 2013)	10.1109/SoftCOM.2013.6671899	embedded system;real-time computing;mobile qos;computer science;computer network	Embedded	-13.537979856497843	87.33234744882462	127506

Since several wireless technologies are candidates to fulfill given automation communication requirements, it is almost impossible for automation engineers to select the appropriate solution, to plan wireless solutions, or to perform diagnosis or fault analysis of a wireless network. Wireless specialists and specific tools are necessary for each potential WS. To overcome this problem, an information model for handling wireless systems throughout the life cycle (LC) has been developed in order to support automation engineers accessing the appropriate information when required.

Currently the interdomain routing protocol limits each router to using a single route for same destination, which may not satisfy the diverse requirements of end users. In this paper, in order to support the effective and efficient multi-path service(MPS), we propose a multi-path inter-domain routing via deviation from primary path(MIR-DPP) which includes two main steps as following. Firstly, to improve the path diversity of node pairs, the special topology collected from neighboring ASes around the primary path, and the multipath set is calculated by our multipath discovery method. Secondly, to gain high-quality paths which are not compliant with routing policy, a negotiation mechanism is designed to address policy limits. Experiments with Internet topology and routing data demonstrate that MIR-DPP offers tremendous flexibility and diversity for path selection with reasonable overhead.	auto-configuration;digital photo professional (dpp);end-to-end principle;experiment;inter-domain;internet topology;mir:ror;multipath i/o;multipath propagation;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;requirement;router (computing);routing	Donghong Qin;Jiahai Yang;Jessie Hui Wang;Bin Zhang;Lei Gao;Zhuolin Liu	2012	The International Conference on Information Network 2012	10.1109/ICOIN.2012.6164381	policy-based routing;private network-to-network interface;wireless routing protocol;routing table;algorithm design;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;source routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;supernetwork;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	-7.518355760047053	81.78872012433287	127663

Typically, data center and cloud providers do not extend these guarantees to the networking layer. Since communication is carried over a network shared by all the tenants, the performance that a tenant application can achieve is unpredictable and depends on factors often beyond the tenant's control. We propose ViTeNA, a Software-Defined Networking-based virtual network embedding algorithm and approach that aims to solve these problems by using the abstraction of virtual networks. Virtual Tenant Networks (VTN) are isolated from each other, offering virtual networks to each of the tenants, with bandwidth guarantees. Deployed along with a scalable OpenFlow controller, ViTeNA allocates virtual tenant networks in a work-conservative system. Preliminary evaluations on data centers with tree and fat-tree topologies indicate that ViTeNA achieves both high consolidation on the allocation of virtual networks and high data center resource utilization.	algorithm;computational resource;data center;differentiated service;distributed computing;fat tree;item unique identification;multitenancy;np-hardness;network performance;openflow;quality of service;run time (program lifecycle phase);scalability;semiconductor consolidation;service-level agreement;software-defined networking	Daniel Caixinha;Pradeeban Kathiravelu;LuÃ­s Veiga	2016	2016 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA)	10.1109/NCA.2016.7778608	real-time computing;virtualization;computer science;resource management;operating system;distributed computing;network topology;bandwidth;server;computer network	Networks	-12.183181662514663	81.7940701682393	127769
d7a7e003f411b55ca5159dd002b067667c80c705	performance modeling of sdn with nfv under or aside the controller		Software Defined Networking (SDN) emphasizes the separation of data and control plane while network function virtualization (NFV) decouples network function from underlying hardware. Combining SDN with NFV would have many benefits, but the problem is how to integrate them. There are two possible architectures for such integration: the controller interacts with virtualized network functions (VNFs) or the switch interacts with VNFs. In this paper, the former is referred to as NFV under the controller (NFV_C) while the latter is called NFV aside the controller (NFV_AC). To the best of our knowledge, there is no analytical model for mathematically investigating the performance of such architectures. This paper therefore aims to carry out analytical modeling of SDN with NFV under or aside the controller. We model and analyze these two SDN+NFV architectures using M/M/1 queuing model and validate our analysis with various simulations. Results show that the analytical results well match the simulation results. Also a packet delay reduction of 54.67% can be achieved for NFV_AC over NFV_C, meaning that NFV_AC is a better architecture for integrating SDN with NFV.	control plane;correctness (computer science);network function virtualization;network packet;queueing theory;simulation;software-defined networking;transfer function	Ahmed Fahmin;Yuan-Cheng Lai;Md.

98af4ed6ec92fd6eb01f46513d2474acfddd8421	content-hierarchical intra-domain cooperative caching for information-centric networks	network operating system;bottleneck analysis;software router	Information-centric networking (ICN) is a clean-slate network architecture to achieve efficient content transmissions. In-network caching is an important issue in ICN, since the routers have a limited caching capacity. Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the cache redundancy, and increase the cache hit ratio and the user delay. Most approaches design algorithms for single routers, and there are still redundant caches in an AS. In this paper, we propose the content-hierarchical Intra-Domain Cooperative Caching (IDCC) scheme to solve the problem, based on the observation that the time of access contents within the local AS is much shorter than that of access contents outside. We use probabilistic caching based on inlet traffic speed, and avoid unnecessary replicas by intra-domain cooperation based on content advertisements. We use hierarchical caching based on content popularity to improve the performance. Our scheme is different from other intra-domain cooperation schemes which remove redundant replicas after contents have been cached. We evaluate our scheme with simulations. The results show that IDCC can improve the hit ratio by 1.7 times and 1.1 times compared to two common existing schemes, respectively.	algorithm;cache (computing);hit (internet);icn gps;network architecture;simulation	Jia Ji;Mingwei Xu;Yuan Yang	2014		10.1145/2619287.2619289	real-time computing;false sharing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-14.540292558647096	75.06666514792467	128019

The proliferation of media-rich content has led to a dramatic increase of backhaul costs, while creating pinching points in the often also limited fronthaul network that faces the end users. This is particularly dramatic for those deployments that rely on already expensive backhaul technologies, such as satellite, as well as limited fronthaul capacities. This paper will lay out the main cost drivers for content provisioning and how to address them through three major innovations, focusing our presentation on the aspect of cooperative off-peak time caching in the fronthaul network. We will outline a solution for addressing these challenges together with efforts related to a first proof-of-concept recently presented to the ETSI standards community.	backhaul (telecommunications);internet access;provisioning	Hongfei Du;Dirk Trossen	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)	10.1109/CSCN.2016.7785162	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;multimedia	Mobile	-14.859270002538338	88.0900712212277	128256
e4b2280d2192eed14970b721ef44ece4d691e8bc	troubleshooting data plane with rule verification in software-defined networks		Data plane network issues, caused by software bugs or hardware failures inside network devices, usually manifest themselves as failed rules, which can be verified by the comparison between actual and desired network behavior. Previous efforts implement this leveraging end-to-end active probing, which falls short on timely locating the exact failure points and identifying responsible rules. With the help of the out-band channel in software-defined network (SDN), per hop active probing can be employed to enable per device or even per rule network behavior comparison to verify the effectiveness of all the rules. Therefore, we present SERVE, an SDN-enabled rule verification framework that automatically identifies data plane network issues with periodic per rule network behavior comparison. By modeling network devices as stateful multi-rooted trees with respect to pipeline processing, a small number of probes can be generated from a per device perspective in a timely manner. We evaluate the performance of SERVEâs probe generation and validate SERVEâs effectiveness on a small deployment with typical use cases.	computation;end-to-end principle;forwarding plane;information privacy;simulation;single molecule real time sequencing;software bug;software deployment;software-defined networking;state (computer science);time complexity;verification and validation	Yusu Zhao;Pengfei Zhang;Yongkun Wang;Yaohui Jin	2018	IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management	10.1109/TNSM.2017.2763187	software deployment;networking hardware;hop (networking);distributed computing;stateful firewall;computer science;small number;forwarding plane;troubleshooting;software-defined networking	Networks	-14.448643240590403	80.96588947017341	128268

In this paper, an availability-aware spare capacity reconfiguration scheme based on shared backup path protection (SBPP) is proposed, aiming to guarantee the E2E availability of each LSP. We first provide an E2E availability model for a SBPP connection that is composed of a working and a SRG-disjoint shared backup LSP pair in the presence of all possible single, and dual simultaneous failures. Partial restoration is identified to further improve the capacity efficiency, and achieve finer service differentiation. For this purpose, restoration attempt is defined as a parameter for each connection that can be manipulated at the source node when the spare capacity of each link is scheduled. Based on the developed model, a linear program (LP) is formulated to perform inter-arrival spare capacity reconfiguration along each pre-determined shared backup LSP to meet the availability constraint of each connection. Simulation is conducted to verify the derived formulation, and to demonstrate the benefits gained in terms of the spare capacity saving ratio, where the conventional SBPP scheme that achieves 100% restorability for any single failure is taken as a benchmark. We will show that the simulation results validate the proposed E2E availability model, where a significant reduction on the required redundancy can be achieved in the effort of meeting a specific availability constraint for each SBPP connection.	backup;benchmark (computing);circuit restoration;generalized multi-protocol label switching;linear programming;path protection;service-level agreement;simulation;strongly regular graph	Pin-Han Ho;JÃ¡nos Tapolcai;Anwar Haque	2008	IEEE Transactions on Reliability	10.1109/TR.2008.2006037	multiprotocol label switching;availability;real-time computing;the internet;quality of service;engineering;linear programming;class of service;distributed computing;routing protocol;informatics;bandwidth;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Embedded	-7.6802149566827875	82.98937488636386	128340
e12d874770244faafbdda8ceba64cb9d2a4492b2	container-based service chaining: a performance perspective	kernel;linux;middleboxes;containers;cloud computing;throughput;hardware	Middleboxes, which implement specific network service functions - e.g. firewalls, load balancers, NATs - have traditionally been deployed as hardware appliances, thereby imposing significant constraints on network operators, who must ensure that the traffic is effectively routed to the appropriate set of middleboxes, following the right order. Being hardware-based, these boxes offer limited upgrade capabilities, i.e. minor tweaks for performance tuning. This problem becomes particularly significant in multi-tenant data centers where each tenant requires their own set of network service functions. A recent trend is to virtualize these middleboxes and turn them into so-called Virtualized Networks Functions (VNFs) that can be chained to offer the appropriate services to each tenant. When the VNFs are implemented as full-fledged virtual machines (VMs), a non-negligible overhead is added due to the kernel of each VM, and it is even more considerable when scaled up for a whole data center. Considering the industry's direction towards containerization technologies, e.g. Docker, we study the case of VNFs implemented as lightweight Linux containers. Weseek to understand how performance evolves as a function of the length of chains of various services, and also of different configuration set-up, for example containers directly connected together or through Open vSwitch switches.	data center;docker;firewall (computing);hardware virtualization;lxc;library (computing);linux;middlebox;multitenancy;network function virtualization;network switch;network traffic control;norm (social);open vswitch;operating system;order of approximation;overhead (computing);performance tuning;requirement;routing;server (computing);traffic shaping;virtual machine;virtualize	Sergio Livi;Quentin Jacquemart;Dino Lopez Pacheco;Guillaume Urvoy-Keller	2016	2016 5th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Networking (Cloudnet)	10.1109/CloudNet.2016.51	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;operating system	Networks	-15.146688438660048	82.00290169004938	128360

The resulting network can provide a large capacity for good quality of service, future growth, and fault tolerance. If a node has more incoming/outgoing fibers, it requires larger optical switches. Using the current photonic technology, it is difficult to realize large optical switches. Even if they can be realized, they are expensive. To overcome this problem, we design a node configuration for all-optical networks. We exploit the flexibility that, to establish a lightpath across a node, we can select any one of the available channels in the incoming link and any one of the available channels in the outgoing link. As a result, the proposed node configuration requires significantly smaller optical switches while it can result in nearly the same blocking probability as the existing one. We demonstrate that a good network design is to adopt the proposed node configuration and slightly more fibers in each link, so that the network requires small optical switches while it has a small blocking probability.	backlink;blocking (computing);erlang (unit);fault tolerance;network planning and design;network switch;optical switch;quality of service	Yiu-Wing Leung;Gaoxi Xiao;Kwok-Wah Hung	2002	IEEE Trans.

We consider minimizing the number of Line Terminating Equipment (LTE) on two types of unidirectional rings, namely, single-hub and un-hubbed rings, as our objective. In single-hub rings, we investigate the minimum cost provisioning of uniform all-to-all traffic in two cases: where network coding is used to linearly combine data, and where it is not used and data is transmitted without coding. We generalize the service mode to many-to-many and evaluate the cost of provisioning. In un-hubbed ring, we propose a multi-hub approach to obtain the minimum cost provisioning in the case of all-to-all and many-to-many traffic. From our numerical results, we find that under many to many traffic, network coding can reduce the network cost by 10-20% in single-hub rings and 1-5% in un-hubbed rings.	algorithm;bifurcation theory;coefficient;compaq lte;computation;divergence (computer science);end-to-end principle;heuristic (computer science);linear network coding;many-to-many;numerical analysis;passive optical network;provisioning;software deployment;token ring;usb hub;wavelength-division multiplexing	Long Long;Ahmed E.

The user experience of such applications is affected by the churn resilience of the system. When peers disconnect from the system, streamed data may be delayed or lost due to missing links in the overlay topology. In this paper, we explore a proactive strategy to create churn-aware overlay networks that reduce the potential of disruptions caused by churn events. We describe Chams, a middleware for constructing overlay networks that mitigates the impact of churn. Chams uses a âhybridâ approachâit implicitly defines an overlay topology using a gossip-style mechanism, while taking the reliability of peers into account. Unlike systems for overlay construction, Chams supports a variety of topologies used in media streaming systems, such as trees, multi-trees and forests.

b6b004e0f6a2a56343cb9d1d090d231fb7342d31	towards network softwarization: a modular approach for network control delegation. (une approche modulaire avec dÃ©lÃ©gation de contrÃ´le pour les rÃ©seaux programmables)		Network operators are facing great challenges in terms of cost and complexity in order to incorporate new communication technologies (e.g., 4G, 5G, fiber) and to keep up with increasing demands of new network services to address emerging use cases. Softwarizing the network operations using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) paradigms can simplify control and management of networks and provide network services in a cost effective way. SDN decouples control and data traffic processing in the network and centralizes the control traffic processing to simplify the network management, but may face scalability issues due to the same reasons. NFV decouples hardware and software of network appliances for cost effective operations of network services, but faces performance degradation issues due to data traffic processing in software. In order to address scalability and performance issues in SDN/NFV, we propose in the first part of the thesis, a modular network control and management architecture, in which the SDN controller delegates part of its responsibilities to specific network functions instantiated in network devices at strategic locations in the infrastructure. We have chosen to focus on a modern application using an IP multicast service for live video streaming applications (e.g., Facebook Live or Periscope) that illustrates well the SDN scalability problems. Our solution exploits benefits of the NFV paradigm to address the scalability issue of centralized SDN control plane by offloading processing of multicast service specific control traffic to Multicast Network Functions (MNFs) implemented in software and executed in NFV environment at the edge of the network. Our approach provides smart, flexible and scalable group management and leverages centralized control of SDN for Lazy Load Balance Multicast (L2BM) traffic engineering policy in software defined ISP networks. Evaluation of this approach is tricky, as real world SDN testbeds are costly and not easily available for the research community. So, we designed a tool that leverages the huge amount of resources available in the grid, to easily emulate such scenarios. Our tool, called DiG, takes into account the physical resources (memory, CPU, link capacity) constraints to provide a realistic evaluation environment with controlled conditions. Our NFV-based approach requires multiple application specific functions (e.g., MNFs) to control and manage the network devices and process the related data traffic in an independent way. Ideally, these specific functions should be implemented directly on hardware programmable routers. In this case, new routers must be able to execute multiple independently developed programs. Packet-level programming language P4, one of the promising SDN-enabling technologies, allows applications to program their data traffic processing on P4 compatible network devices. In the second part of the thesis, we propose a novel approach to deploy and execute multiple independently developed and compiled applications programs on the same network device. This solution, called P4Bricks, allows multiple applications to control and manage their data traffic, independently. P4Bricks merges programmable blocks (parsers/deparsers and packet processing pipelines) of P4 programs according to processing semantics (parallel or sequential) provided at the time of deployment.	central processing unit;centralized computing;compiler;control plane;elegant degradation;expression (computer science);lazy evaluation;load balancing (computing);multicast;network function virtualization;network packet;networking hardware;parsing;pipeline (computing);programming language;programming paradigm;scalability;software deployment;software-defined networking;streaming media	Hardik Soni	2018				Networks	-14.64653847150421	82.84856195806297	128942

99b8ae6726e8363d1d76d0dd4b2fb81248f046ea	a holistic approach to mitigating dos attacks in sdn networks		SummaryrnSoftware-defined networking (SDN) has recently emerged as a new networking technology offering an unprecedented programmability that allows network operators to dynamically manage their infrastructures. However, despite these benefits, deny-of-service (DoS) attacks are considered a major threat to such networks, as they can easily overload the SDN controller and flood switch forwarding tables, resulting in a critical degradation of the network performance. To address this issue, we propose SDN-Guard, a novel holistic approach to protect SDN networks against DoS attacks. Software-defined networkingâGuard leverages an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect potential DoS attacks and then efficiently mitigate their impact by dynamically (1) rerouting malicious traffic, (2) adjusting flow time-outs, and (3) aggregating flow rules. This paper extends our previous work by proposing solutions to minimize the switch-to-IDS traffic without impacting the IDS accuracy. We hence propose to use sampling techniques and devise an integer linear program to find the optimal placement for the IDS and to determine the switches that should mirror the flows towards it so as to minimize network bandwidth consumption. Extensive experiments using Mininet show that SDN-Guard maintains network performance during DoS attacks and succeeds in reducing by up to 32% their impact on controller performance, usage of switch forwarding tables, and control plane bandwidth. Furthermore, our results show that carefully placing the IDS and selecting the switches mirroring, the traffic can reduce by up to 90% the switch-to-IDS traffic. They also show that the IDS accuracy remains at 100% by analyzing only 11% of the network traffic.	denial-of-service attack;holism;software-defined networking	Lobna Dridi;Mohamed Faten Zhani	2018	Int.

Furthermore, some deadlock conditions discovered in one of these algorithms are completely recovered. The comparison is carried out for both evaluation criteria (Rm and Pf ) and it is shown that the new criterion leads to a deep insight of the systems, necessary for a successful network design.	algorithm;common criteria;deadlock;network planning and design;simulation	Ioannis Gragopoulos;Fotini-Niovi Pavlidou	1997	IEEE Trans.

In this paper we propose a novel bandwidth allocation strategy which partitions the available bandwidth amongst the different traffic classes in a manner that ensures quality-of-service guarantees for digital video while minimizing the maximum blocking probability for voice and data connections. At the connection level, near-optimum utilization of the reserved bandwidth for video traffic is achieved through an intra-frame statistical multiplexing algorithm, while at the system level the delicate task of partitioning the bandwidth between voice, video and data is accomplished by developing an efficient algorithm which uses traffic parameters consisting only of the aggregate traffic load and the total available bandwidth. The algorithm, built on non-trivial mathematical results is robust, easy to implement and has a geometric rate of convergence which ensures that the partitioning points are found quickly. These properties make it well suited for practical implementations, even for cases where changes in the aggregate traffic loads cause bandwidth allocations to be recomputed frequently. ï 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	atm turbo;aggregate data;algorithm;blocking (computing);digital video;erlang (unit);integrated services;intra-frame coding;john d. wiley;multiplexing;quality of service;rate of convergence;robustness (computer science)	Paramvir Bahl;Imrich Chlamtac;AndrÃ¡s FaragÃ³	1998	Int.

Understanding the infrastructure characteristics such as the network topology, routing design, address allocation, and DNS service configuration is essential for predicting, diagnosing, and improving cellular network services, as well as for delivering content to the growing population of mobile wireless users. In this work, we propose a novel approach for discovering cellular infrastructure by intelligently combining several data sources, i.e., server logs from a popular location search application, active measurements results collected from smartphone users, DNS request logs from a DNS authoritative server, and publicly available routing updates. We perform the first comprehensive analysis to characterize the cellular data network infrastructure of four major cellular carriers within the U.S. in our study.  We conclude among other previously little known results that the current routing of cellular data traffic is quite restricted, as it must traverse a rather limited number (i.e., 4-6) of infrastructure locations (i.e., GGSNs), which is in sharp contrast to wireline Internet traffic. We demonstrate how such findings have direct implications on important decisions such as mobile content placement and content server selection. We observe that although the local DNS server is a coarse-grained approximation on the user's network location, for some carriers, choosing content servers based on the local DNS server is accurate enough due to the restricted routing in cellular networks. Placing content servers close to GGSNs can potentially reduce the end-to-end latency by more than 50% excluding the variability from air interface.	approximation;end-to-end principle;mobile phone;network topology;routing;server (computing);smartphone;spatial variability;traverse	Qiang Xu;Junxian Huang;Zhaoguang Wang;Feng Qian;Alexandre Gerber;Zhuoqing Morley Mao	2011		10.1145/1993744.1993777	cellular network;internet traffic;computer science;operating system;world wide web;computer security;network topology;computer network	Metrics	-17.594035980988945	76.97213853698395	129376

It is possible to migrate virtualized network functions (VNFs) across datacenters for auto scaling and auto healing when traffic concentration or failure occurs. However, networks must provide a new network path corresponding to the new traffic flow generated by VNF migration. The problem is that those added network paths cause a cost increase. We propose two cost effective resource sharing methods that use transport software defined network (SDN) and optical cross connect (OXC) to reduce the number of servers and network CAPEX.	autoscaling;data center;digital cross connect system;image scaling;network function virtualization;operating-system-level virtualization;optical cross-connect;process migration;software-defined networking;transfer function	Seisuke Arai;Takuya Tojo;Shingo Okada;Seisho Yasukawa	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Local and Metropolitan Area Networks (LANMAN)	10.1109/LANMAN.2017.7972150	architecture;intelligent computer network;distributed computing;computer network;resource management;computer science;traffic flow;optical cross-connect;software-defined networking;server;shared resource	Arch	-13.061155697848628	80.84347410372757	129902

Although current UDP protocol, which is one of the transport layer protocol of NFS, cannot handle multiple paths simultaneously, the proposed method can multi-pathize UDP by utilizing SDN without any changes of current TCP/IP protocols. The method distributes packets over multiple paths according to the congestion of the paths and the length of IP packets. Since the control is performed on SDN, no changes of existing protocols, softwares, and devices are required.

To ensure adequate performance for multicast traffic, the authors develop and analyze a class of call scheduling algorithms via call splitting. Call splitting algorithms reduce output contention by generating smaller subcalls from a multicast call. It is shown that slot contention blocking is the predominant factor of blocking a multicast call, which suggests that call splitting may be an efficient strategy for a multicast call. The authors devise a deterministic call splitting algorithm and show that excessive call splitting can degrade performance because of the additional load introduced to the input ports. The authors also investigate an adaptive splitting algorithm which achieves performance approach the optimum by avoiding excessive call splitting. >	algorithm;multicast	Chong-kwon Kim;Tony T.

Although there is a portable mechanism for accessing the server-internal topology there is no such mechanism for accessing the network topology of modern HPC systems in an equally portable manner. The Network Locality (netloc) project provides mechanisms for portably discovering and abstractly representing the network topology of modern HPC systems. Additionally, netloc provides the ability to merge the network topology with the server-internal topologies resulting in a comprehensive map of the HPC system topology. Using a modular infrastructure, netloc provides support for a variety of network types and discovery techniques. By representing the network topology as a graph, netloc supports any network topology configuration. The netloc architecture hides the topology discovery mechanism from the application developer thus allowing them to focus on traversing and analyzing the resulting map of the HPC system topology.	algorithms for recovery and isolation exploiting semantics;callback (computer programming);computational complexity theory;computer science;daemon (computing);linear algebra;link layer discovery protocol;locality of reference;mathematical optimization;memory footprint;network topology;online and offline;problem domain;processor affinity;scalability;server (computing);simple network management protocol	Brice Goglin;Joshua Hursey;Jeffrey M.

Applications can exploit dedicated, high-speed optical circuits to tightly interconnect remote resources on-demand, and achieve high quality of service. However, they must contend with the complexity of highly distributed and heterogeneous resource environments. In addition, network configurability presents unique challenges, adding the complexity of planning configurations to that of traditional end resource management. #R##N#To enable efficient and simple development of high performance applications, this dissertation proposes the Distributed Virtual Computer (DVC), a novel integrated architecture for managing configurable networks and wide-area resource sharing. The DVC allows an application to describe and acquire a combined set of communication and end resources, and then automatically manages them for guaranteed, high performance. Such an integrated approach enables coordinated resource management improving both application capabilities and resource efficiencies. #R##N#In this framework, a key challenge is selecting appropriate sets of resources for individual applications. We formulate the selection problem, explore several approaches, and evaluate each via simulation. Best performance is achieved by techniques that combine the selection of communication and end resources. Such approaches produce high-quality solutions both for application performance and for network efficiency, and scale well for large resource environments. This enables an online service where applications can request and acquire high-quality resources quickly on-demand. #R##N#In a multi-domain network, a critical tension exists between service providers who are business competitors. As a result, controlled information sharing is required that balances their competitive positions and enables efficient resource selection. We characterize the network information that could be shared between providers and assess how individual information affects applications and service providers. Our results suggest providers should share their internal information as it can improve their resource efficiencies and application performance. #R##N#We implement a DVC system software prototype and present experimental results with real scientific applications and optical networks. We demonstrate our prototype enables the simple configuration of collaborative data visualization environments that can be flexibly run on different physical resource configurations. Additionally, the applications are able to exploit dedicated optical circuits on-demand and efficiently utilize the network capacity.

Historically, a similar situation - but more spectacular - was observed in the beginning of the 1990s, during the first real (not simulated or emulated) TCP transmissions over newly introduced ATM networks. In the paper we test behavior of the multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocol over IEEE 802.11ac WLAN using real network equipment. Experiments were carried out in a test private cloud, built using the OpenStack open source cloud system. In experiments, a mobile node accessed the cloud using the MPTCP protocol working over two 802.11ac links. The performed tests covered multipath access to the cloud with the use of dedicated links and shared links, as well as migration of the cloud's data following the mobile node which changed its point of attachment to the cloud.	atm turbo;attachments;cloud computing;compaq lte;emulator;experiment;in the beginning... was the command line;internet protocol suite;multipath propagation;open-source software	Agnieszka Chodorek;Robert R.

57e40573f8c91eb4369483125e4dbca4f343ae73	geoweight: internet host geolocation based on a probability model for latency measurements	probability model	Knowing the geographical location of an Internet host is of importance to many of todayâs Internet services. In this paper we focus on geolocating Internet hosts based purely on latency measurements. Existing latency measurement-based geolocation techniques use the observed latencies from multiple landmarks to the target host to determine maximum bound or both the maximum and minimum bounds of the geographical region where the target host is located. Due to the large variance of Internet latency measurements, the region constrained based on such maximum-minimum bounds tends to be relatively large resulting in large estimation errors. We propose a geolocation algorithm, GeoWeight, which improves the geolocation accuracy by further limiting the possible target region by dividing the constrained region to sub-regions of different weights. The weight assigned to a subregion indicates the probability of the target being in that sub-region; a higher weight indicating a more probable region. By considering latency measurements from multiple landmarks and computing the resultant weights of overlapping regions a better constrained target region can be obtained. This paper presents the GeoWeight algorithm and evaluates its performance using both synthetic and real data by geolocating target hosts in North America. We compare GeoWeight with two popular geolocation techniques, Octant and CBG, by geolocating the same set of targets. The results show that the GeoWeight algorithm outperforms existing techniques.	algorithm;dhrystone;geolocation;host (network);location (geography);maxima and minima;planetlab;resultant;testbed	Mohammed Jubaer Arif;Shanika Karunasekera;Santosh Kulkarni	2010			simulation;geography;telecommunications;computer security	Metrics	-17.51264532188731	77.0144220173752	131303

The increase in network churn, generated by a growing mobile client base recycling connections, could impact maintaining the critical balance between anonymity and performance. New combinatorial approaches for measuring both anonymity and performance need to be developed in order to identify critical changes to the network dynamics, and trigger intervention if and when required. We present q-factor, a novel longitudinal approach to measuring anonymity and performance within highly dynamic environments. By modelling q-factor, we show that the impact of mobility, over time, on anonymity is significant. However, by using q-factor, we are able to anticipate and significantly reduce the number of these critical events occurring. In order to make more effective strategic design and/or real-time network decisions in the future, low-latency anonymity networks will be required to adopt an even more proactive approach to network management. The potential impact from increasing mobile usage needs to be considered, as what may initially be perceived as a good solution, may in fact degrade, or in the worst case could destroy the anonymity of users over time.	best, worst and average case;degradation (telecommunications);proxy server;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;tor messenger	Stephen Doswell;David Kendall;Nauman Aslam;Graham Sexton	2015	2015 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2015.7289066	anonymity;computer science;internet privacy;mobility model;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-11.375779567345445	78.07504484648993	131336

With an enormous volume of content available in the network, as well as the growing size of content owing to the popularity of high-definition video, the exploration of capacity in the caching network becomes a critical issue in providing guaranteed service. Yet, collaboration strategies among cache servers in emerging scenarios, such as IPTV services, are still not well understood so far. In this paper, we propose an efficient collaborative caching mechanism based on the topology derived from a real-world IPTV system, with a particular focus on exploring the capacity of the existing system infrastructure. We observe that collaboration among servers is largely affected by the topology characteristics and heterogeneous capacities of the network. Meanwhile, dynamic request routing within the caching network is strongly coupled with content placement decisions when designing the mechanism. Our proposed mechanism is implemented in a distributed manner, and is amenable to practical deployment. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism, as compared to conventional cache cooperation with static routing schemes.	cpu cache;cache (computing);digital distribution;hdmi;iptv;routing;server (computing);simulation;software deployment	Jie Dai;Zhan Hu;Bo Li;Jiangchuan Liu;Baochun Li	2012	2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195634	routing;real-time computing;computer science;world wide web;network topology;bandwidth;server;computer network;collaboration	Metrics	-15.418634156344256	76.17035782356349	131340

We present a linear program to optimize the SPM load balancing parameters for network dimensioning. Our study shows that the SPM is a very efficient mechanism in the sense that it requires only little backup capacity since it outperforms the p-cycle approach and the shortest path rerouting by far. The investigation of the computation time and the memory consumption recommends the Simplex method as an LP solver rather than an interior point method (IPM). The computation time of the program depends mainly on the number of links in the network and it is well feasible for small and and medium size networks. For large networks, however, fast heuristics are required.	backup;best, worst and average case;computation;dijkstra's algorithm;experiment;heuristic (computer science);hyperlink;interior point method;linear programming;load balancing (computing);loss function;mathematical optimization;multipath propagation;multiprotocol label switching;numerical analysis;optimization problem;polynomial;shortest path problem;simplex algorithm;solver;subject matter expert turing test;super paper mario;time complexity	Michael Menth;RÃ¼diger Martin;Ulrich SpÃ¶rlein	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.254813	multiprotocol label switching;availability;routing;quality of service;scanning probe microscopy;telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;load balancing;interior point method;distributed computing;shortest path problem;simplex algorithm;psychological resilience;computer network	Robotics	-6.145393829634141	82.4232876348676	131456
670b104106d9f61d0890932de74e350870dd07e7	an efficient spectrum assignment algorithm based on variable-grouping mechanism for flex-grid optical networks		Flex-grid optical networks (FONs) employ dynamic routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) algorithms to support diverse services with heterogeneous bit-rates. Although these RSA algorithms can increase the flexibility and efficiency of spectrum allocation, they may also possibly induce spectrum fragments when allocating spectrum to accommodate different service requests. The generated spectrum fragments may exhaust the available spectrum resources and degrade networking performances. Therefore, many schemes referred as defragmentation algorithms have been proposed to reduce spectrum fragments at the cost of traffic disruption or extra components, which are usually required to handle the fragmented spectrum via resource reoptimization. Although some grouping RSA algorithms have been proposed to prevent the generation of spectrum fragments with no traffic disruption or extra components, the pre-divided fixed spectrum groups reduce the flexibility in a dynamic spectrum assignment and thus degrade the blocking performance of the network. In this paper, we propose a RSA algorithm based on variable-grouping mechanism, namely Minimized Variable Grouping (MVG) RSA algorithm, which can not only efficiently restrain the generation of spectrum fragments, but also improve the blocking performance compared to the typical ungrouped and the conventional grouping RSA algorithms. By employing variable grouping mechanism, the proposed algorithm sorts services into different kinds according to their bandwidth requirements and then divides the spectrum resources into several variable groups according to the kinds of services. And the generation of the spectrum fragments is restricted in the spectrum intervals between two adjacent groups. In this way, the proposed algorithm can dramatically restrain the generation of fragments. In addition, the proposed algorithm can reduce the blocking probability by minimizing the grouped spectrum resources to maximize the remained vacant spectrum resources in the spectrum intervals between two adjacent groups for future service requests and thus helps improve the blocking performance. The simulation results show that the proposed MVG RSA algorithm can dramatically reduce the fragments with no traffic disruption while exhibiting a low blocking probability.	algorithm;blocking (computing);denial-of-service attack;erlang (unit);frequency allocation;performance;rsa (cryptosystem);requirement;routing;simulation;xslt/muenchian grouping	Yang Qiu	2017	Optical Switching and Networking	10.1016/j.osn.2016.11.005	real-time computing;telecommunications;distributed computing	Metrics	-8.405370426244772	81.90810739035119	131574

The interconnection of pervasively deployed multimedia nano-devices with existing communication networks and ultimately the Internet defines a novel communication paradigm that is further referred to as the Internet of Multimedia Nano-Things (IoMNT). The IoMNT is a truly cyberâphysical system with a plethora of applications in the biomedical, security and defense, environmental and industrial fields, amongst others. This paper discusses the state of the art and major research challenges in the realization of the IoMNT. Fundamental research challenges and future research trends are outlined in terms of multimedia data and signal processing, propagation modeling for communication amongst nanothings in the terahertz band, physical layer solutions for terahertz band communication and protocols for the IoMNT. These include novel medium access control techniques, addressing schemes, neighbor discovery and routing mechanisms, a novel QoS-aware cross-layer communication module, and novel security solutions for the IoMNT.

Therefore, SDN aims to separate control and data planes clearly, which is an innovative and effective approach to this problem. With SDN, a service provider can adjust the settings of a network according to various requirements dynamically and in a timely fashion. This feature is especially suitable for a wireless scenario with dynamic and unstable changing situations. Meanwhile, because various algorithms, such as traffic forwarding and quality of service, can be operated by a central controller, SDN is a natural optional technique for WNV. In this article, we illustrate the framework for combining SDN and WNV, review state-of-the-art related work, and discuss the challenges for future study.	algorithm;control theory;mathematical optimization;multitier architecture;quality of service;requirement;software-defined networking;traffic exchange	Bin Cao;Fang He;Yun Li;Chonggang Wang;Wenqiang Lang	2015	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2015.7166185	quality of service;computer science;radio resource management;resource management;wireless network;software-defined radio;distributed computing;software-defined networking;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-14.197801594413162	85.20714581470713	131623

The goal of this paper is to generalize the study in [1] to account for dedicated path protection switching mechanisms applied to bidirectional lightpaths. In doing so, a second factor must be accounted for in the study, i.e., the wavelength assigned to the working circuit may be decoupled from the wavelength assigned to the protection circuit. As a result, four design options are possible by either enforcing or relaxing each of the following two constraints: 1) lightpaths are (are not) required to be assigned the same wavelength for the inward and outward circuit; 2) lightpaths are (are not) required to be assigned the same wavelength for the working and protection circuit. The four design options are compared in terms of their required average number of WCs in the network, revealing that the WC usage may differ significantly depending on the design used.	control plane;coupling (computer programming);direct inward dial;path protection;transmitter;wavelength-division multiplexing;write combining;writing commons	Arularasi Sivasankaran;Miguel Razo;Wanjun Huang;Limin Tang;Marco Tacca;Andrea Fumagalli	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364421	telecommunications;computer science;wavelength-division multiplexing	EDA	-7.644227887441948	83.38888554652226	131820

ANs are also flexible i.e. they can compose and decompose dynamically and automatically, for supporting the deployment of cross-domain (new) services. Thus, the AN architecture must be sophisticatedly designed to support such high level of dynamicity, heterogeneity and flexibility. We advocate the use of service specific overlay networks in ANs, that are created on-demand according to specific service requirements, to deliver, and to automatically adapt services to the dynamically changing user and network context.

In this paper, we describe and study three particular realizations of static optical core networks and compare them with the dynamic, packet switched architecture based on wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) transmission and conventional electronic packet routers. We introduce an analytical model for estimating the average number of required switch ports for different network topologies in order to assess both scalability and power consumption of the considered network concepts. The results show that the concept of a static optically transparent core network promises high energy efficiency, and scalability to several tens of nodes.	core (optical fiber);egress filtering;network packet;network topology;packet switching;scalability;wavelength-division multiplexing	Slavisa Aleksic;Ward Van Heddeghem;Mario Pickavet	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503651	real-time computing;core network;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	HPC	-7.473982172454075	84.87725967463402	131870

The quickest path problem thus arises to find a single path with minimum transmission time. More specifically, the capacity of each arc is assumed to be deterministic. However, in many real-life networks such as computer networks and telecommunication networks, the capacity of each arc is stochastic due to failure, maintenance, etc. Hence, the minimum transmission time is not a fixed number. Such a network is named a stochastic-flow network. In order to reduce the transmission time, the network allows the data to be transmitted through k minimal paths simultaneously. Including the cost attribute, this paper evaluates the probability that d units of data can be transmitted under both time threshold T and budget B. Such a probability is called the system reliability. An efficient algorithm is proposed to generate all of lower boundary points for (d,Ã T,Ã B), the minimal capacity vectors satisfying the demand, time, and budget requirements. The system reliability can then be computed in terms of such points. Moreover, the optimal combination of k minimal paths with highest system reliability can be obtained.

It can perform two kinds of routing ways with the capability of static or dynamic routing. In the IMS network, network traffic is very fickle, therefore, a dynamic routing way is more efficient than static routing one because it can make the flow of traffic changeful among nodes in the IMS. In this paper, we suggest a management function of NMS, applying a dynamic routing algorithm in order to manage IMS nodes. Finally, we apply the algorithm by deploying a PoC service, one of the prominent application services in the IMS.	algorithm;routing	Jae Hyoung Cho;Jae-Oh Lee	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24106-2_3	real-time computing;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	-10.056886907235839	84.57377562831726	132054

In a previous paper, we proposed a new design called CVM (communication virtual machine) to overcome these problems by having a high-level API which can be reused and extended easily for user-centric applications in any domain. Within CVM framework, we came across a practical issue, which is actually the case for any end- to-end multimedia communication, namely the NAT-traversal (network address translation) problem that limits the reliability and availability of CVM and variants of CVM. In this paper, we explain about the necessity of self-configuration for the NAT-traversal problem in end-to-end communications, and propose a solution within the core CVM framework.	application programming interface;domain-specific language;end-to-end principle;high- and low-level;nat traversal;network address translation;programming paradigm;stovepipe system;virtual machine	Seyed Masoud Sadjadi;Selim Kalayci;Yi Deng	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control	10.1109/ICNSC.2008.4525314	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;virtual machine;operating system;distributed computing;computer network;autonomic computing	Embedded	-17.708658815510173	85.16542835595178	132207

This paper proposes an ICN/WDM network architecture that uses these features to offer superior network utilization, in terms of performance and power consumption. The architecture introduces an ICN publish/subscribe communication approach to the wavelength layer, whereby content is aggregated according to its popularity rank into wavelength-size groups that can be published and subscribed to by multiple nodes. Consequently, routing and wavelength assignment RWA algorithms benefit from anycast to identify multiple sources of aggregate content and allow optimization of the source selection of light paths. A power-aware algorithm, maximum degree of connectivity, has been developed with the objective of exploiting this flexibility to address the tradeoff between power consumption and network performance. The algorithm is also applicable to IP architectures, albeit with less flexibility. Evaluation results indicate the superiority of the proposed ICN architecture, even when utilizing conventional routing methods, compared with its IP counterpart. The results further highlight the performance improvement achieved by the proposed algorithm, compared with the conventional RWA methods, such as shortest-path first fit.	aggregate data;algorithm;anycast;computer architecture;future internet;icn gps;mathematical optimization;network architecture;network performance;point location;publishâsubscribe pattern;routing and wavelength assignment;shortest path problem;wavelength-division multiplexing	Mays F.

Previous research in this area has focused on either deriving better monitor placement strategies for fixed routing, or strategically routing traffic sub-populations over existing deployed monitors to maximize the measurement gain. However, neither of them alone suffices in real scenarios, since not only the number of deployed monitors is limited, but also the traffic characteristics and measurement objectives are constantly changing. This paper presents an MMPR (Measurement-aware Monitor Placement and Routing) framework that jointly optimizes monitor placement and dynamic routing strategy to achieve maximum measurement utility. The main challenge in solving MMPR is to decouple the relevant decision variables and adhere to the intra-domain traffic engineering constraints. We formulate it as an MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) problem and propose several heuristic algorithms to approximate the optimal solution and reduce the computation complexity. Through experiments using real traces and topologies (Abilene , AS6461 , and GEANT ), we show that our heuristic solutions can achieve measurement gains that are quite close to the optimal solutions, while reducing the computation times by a factor of 23X in Abilene (small), 246X in AS6461 (medium), and 233X in GEANT (large), respectively.	abilene paradox;approximation algorithm;computation;experiment;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;place and route;population;routing;tracing (software)	Guanyao Huang;Chia-Wei Chang;Chen-Nee Chuah;Bill Lin	2012	IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management	10.1109/TNSM.2012.010912.110128	network management;heuristic;traffic engineering;routing;static routing;real-time computing;simulation;integer programming;adaptive routing;computer science;linear programming;mathematical model;computational complexity theory;computer network	Metrics	-10.33875237994641	81.65543960971138	132471

By differentiating application traffic into different service classes, bandwidth allocation is managed accordingly to fulfill QoS requirements. Incorporating with congestion control scheme which consists of dynamic arbitration and adaptive routing path selection, high priority traffic is directed to less congested areas and is given preference to available resources. Simulation results show that average latency of high priority and overall traffic is improved dramatically for various traffic patterns. Cost evaluation results also show that the proposed router architecture requires negligible cost overhead but provides better performance for both advanced mesh NoC platforms.	network congestion;network on a chip;quality of service;router (computing);throughput	Chifeng Wang;Nader Bagherzadeh	2014	Microprocessors and Microsystems - Embedded Hardware Design	10.1016/j.micpro.2013.09.006	embedded system;network traffic control;real-time computing;computer network	Arch	-9.119504081473705	83.23527245032793	132541

The standard way to obtain information about the internet topology is to use the traceroute tool from a small number of monitors. Recent papers have made the case that increasing the number of monitors will give a more accurate view of the topology. However, scaling up the number of monitors is not a trivial process. Duplication of effort close to the monitors wastes time by reexploring well-known parts of the network, and close to destinations might appear to be a distributed denialof-service (DDoS) attack as the probes converge from a set of sources towards a given destination. In prior work, authors of this report proposed Doubletree, an algorithm for cooperative topology discovery, that reduces the load on the network, i.e., router IP interfaces and end-hosts, while discovering almost as many nodes and links as standard approaches based on traceroute. This report presents our open-source and freely downloadable implementation of Doubletree in a tool we call traceroute@home. We describe the deployment and validation of traceroute@home on the PlanetLab testbed and we report on the lessons learned from this experience. We discuss how traceroute@home can be developed further and discuss ideas for future improvements.	algorithm;converge;data deduplication;denial-of-service attack;image scaling;internet topology;network topology;open-source software;planetlab;router (computing);software deployment;testbed;traceroute	Benoit Donnet;Bradley Huffaker;Timur Friedman;Kimberly C.

This paper discusses two types of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks specific to OpenFlow SDN networks. We emulate them on Mininet and provide an analysis on the effect of these attacks. We find that the timeout value of a flow rule, and the control plane bandwidth have a significant impact on the switch's capability. If not configured appropriately, they may allow successful DoS attacks.

1b6bd5b39622d60704e8117fc0803739996954df	scalable application- and user-aware resource allocation in enterprise networks using end-host pacing		Scalable userand application-aware resource allocation for heterogeneous applications sharing an enterprise network is still an unresolved problem. The main challenges are: (i) How to define userand application-aware shares of resources? (ii) How to determine an allocation of shares of network resources to applications? (iii) How to allocate the shares per application in heterogeneous networks at scale? In this paper we propose solutions to the three challenges and introduce a system design for enterprise deployment. Defining the necessary resource shares per application is hard, as the intended use case, the userâs environment, e.g., big or small display, and the userâs preferences influence the resource demand. We tackle the challenge by associating application flows with utility functions from subjective user experience models, selected Key Performance Indicators, and measurements. The specific utility functions then enable a mapping of network resources in terms of throughput and latency budget to a common user-level utility scale. A sensible distribution of the resources is determined by formulating a multi-objective MILP to solve the throughputand delay-aware embedding of each utility function in the network for a max-min fairness criteria. The allocation of resources in traditional networks with policing and scheduling cannot distinguish large numbers of classes and interacts badly with congestion control algorithms. We propose a resource allocation system design for enterprise networks based on Software-Defined Networking principles to achieve delay-constrained routing in the network and application pacing at the end-hosts. The system design is evaluated against best effort networks in a proof-of-concept set-up for scenarios with increasing number of parallel applications competing for the throughput of a constrained link. The competing applications belong to the five application classes web browsing, file download, remote terminal work, video streaming, and Voice-over-IP. The results show that the proposed methodology improves the minimum and total utility, minimizes packet loss and queuing delay at bottlenecks, establishes fairness in terms of utility between applications, and achieves predictable application performance at high link utilization.	algorithm;best-effort delivery;bottleneck (software);download;fairness measure;heterogeneous computing;max-min fairness;multistage interconnection networks;network congestion;network packet;queuing delay;routing;scheduling (computing);semantic network;software deployment;software-defined networking;streaming media;systems design;throughput;user experience;user space;utility	Christian Sieber;Susanna Schwarzmann;Andreas Blenk;Thomas Zinner;Wolfgang Kellerer	2018	CoRR		enterprise private network;distributed computing;packet loss;scheduling (computing);scalability;user experience design;computer science;heterogeneous network;resource allocation;queuing delay	Metrics	-11.314267416693873	81.74370245045739	133318

To address this fundamental problem, network virtualization has been proposed, where a single physical infrastructure is shared among different virtual network slices. A key operational problem in network virtualization is the need to allocate physical node and link resources to virtual network requests. While several different virtual network mapping algorithms have been proposed in literature, it is difficult to compare their performance due to differences in the evaluation methods used. In this paper, we proposed VNMBench, a virtual network mapping benchmark that provides a set of standardized inputs and evaluation metrics. Using this benchmark, different algorithms can be evaluated and compared objectively. We present such an evaluation using three existing virtual network mapping algorithms. We compare the evaluation results of our synthetic benchmark with those of actual Emulab requests to show that VNMBench is sufficiently realistic. We believe this work provides an important foundation to quantitatively evaluating the performance of a critical component in the operation of virtual networks.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);dhrystone;internet;network architecture;network mapping;performance evaluation;software deployment;usability	Jin Zhu;Tilman Wolf	2012	2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289308	communications protocol;enterprise private network;the internet;simulation;intelligent computer network;overlay network;network architecture;network management station;resource allocation;computer science;network simulation;distributed computing;standardization;computer network;network mapping	HPC	-12.395226673830416	81.2550064460948	133319

It is this local and autonomous network state information that makes our approach particularly suitable for distributed implementation , and applicable to optical network architectures and control protocols that support service level guarantees. To illustrate this, we study mesh networks consisting of transparent, short-reach networking segments interconnected by long-reach WDM links with electronically regenerative gateways, where different link types show different SNR degradation, reliability and delay. On the example of electronically regenerative gateways, we address a new class of constraint-based path selection problems, where a certain a type of network element can at the same time deteriorate and improve network performance; e.g. electronic regenera-tors improve optical path quality and can adapt to wavelengths, but induce delays or operational costs. The performance study has shown the capability of our methods to accommodate arbitrary number and type of optical path properties, related to different network architectures and services. A. INTRODUCTION The recent emerging of high bit-rate IP network applications is creating the need for on-demand provisioning of wavelength routed channels with service-differentiated offerings within the transport layer. To fulfill these requirements, different optical transport network architectures have been proposed , driven by fundamental advances in WDM optical technologies. The availability of ultra long-reach transport and all-optical switching has enabled the deployment of all-optical networks. However, due to the lack of all-optical signal regen-eration, accurate engineering of analogue WDM spans becomes critical. With dynamic wavelength routing, different paths are likely to show different performance in terms of transmission quality due to the additive nature of signal degradations , making the provisioning of on-demand wavelength channels in all-optical (transparent) networks a challenging task. On the other hand, optical network architectures that include electronic regeneration at each switching node (referred to as opaque optical networks) resolve the problem of traffic impairments but impose different sets of limitations to the wavelength routed channels. In fact, although electronic regenera-tion simplifies the WDM span design and resolves wavelength continuity constraints, it also adds delay, can significantly reduce the connection (and network) reliability and increase operational costs. For these and other optical transport network architectures, as well as for multi-vendor environments, the availability of routing information for efficient protocols will be critical to enable dynamic and service-differentiated â¦	autonomous robot;computation;computational complexity theory;constrained shortest path first;elegant degradation;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;multi-objective optimization;network architecture;network performance;next-generation network;optical switch;passive optical network;provisioning;requirement;routing;scott continuity;signal-to-noise ratio;software deployment;time complexity;utility functions on indivisible goods;wavelength-division multiplexing	Admela Jukan;Gerald Franzl	2002		10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019329	telecommunications;computer science;mesh networking;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	-9.0288628316733	85.15599255939483	133338

Diagnosing anomalies is critical for both network operators and end users. It is a difficult problem because one must extract and interpret anomalous patterns from large amounts of high-dimensional, noisy data.In this paper we propose a general method to diagnose anomalies. This method is based on a separation of the high-dimensional space occupied by a set of network traffic measurements into disjoint subspaces corresponding to normal and anomalous network conditions. We show that this separation can be performed effectively by Principal Component Analysis.Using only simple traffic measurements from links, we study volume anomalies and show that the method can: (1) accurately detect when a volume anomaly is occurring; (2) correctly identify the underlying origin-destination (OD) flow which is the source of the anomaly; and (3) accurately estimate the amount of traffic involved in the anomalous OD flow.We evaluate the method's ability to diagnose (i.e., detect, identify, and quantify) both existing and synthetically injected volume anomalies in real traffic from two backbone networks. Our method consistently diagnoses the largest volume anomalies, and does so with a very low false alarm rate.	abilene paradox;anomaly detection;instrumentation (computer programming);internet backbone;network packet;principal component analysis;routing;signal-to-noise ratio;software bug;sprint (software development);time series;voltage spike;eric	Anukool Lakhina;Mark Crovella;Christophe Diot	2004		10.1145/1015467.1015492	anomaly detection;computer science;technical report;data mining;constant false alarm rate;computer security;principal component analysis	Networks	-16.082649710363928	79.1124209743573	133701

790fd62b38ff35039c2aabb443713ffbbc3a16c7	enhancing middleware-based iot applications through run-time pluggable qos management mechanisms. application to a onem2m compliant iot middleware		In the recent years, telecom and computer networks have witnessed new concepts and technologies through Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). SDN, which allows applications to have a control over the network, and NFV, which allows deploying network functions in virtualized environments, are two paradigms that are increasingly used for the Internet of Things (IoT). This Internet (IoT) brings the promise to interconnect billions of devices in the next few years rises several scientific challenges in particular those of the satisfaction of the quality of service (QoS) required by the IoT applications. In order to address this problem, we have identified two bottlenecks with respect to the QoS: the traversed networks and the intermediate entities that allows the application to interact with the IoT devices. In this paper, we first present an innovative vision of a ânetwork functionâ with respect to their deployment and runtime environment. Then, we describe our general approach of a solution that consists in the dynamic, autonomous, and seamless deployment of QoS management mechanisms. We also describe the requirements for the implementation of such approach. Finally, we present a redirection mechanism, implemented as a network function, allowing the seamless control of the data path of a given middleware traffic. This mechanism is assessed through a use case related to vehicular transportation. Â© 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Flit-reservation flow control requires control flits to precede data flits, which can be realized through fast on-chip control wires or the pipelining of control flits one or more cycles ahead of data flits. Scheduling ahead of data arrival enables buffers to be held only during actual buffer usage, unlike existing flow control methods. It also eliminates data latency due to routing and arbitration decisions. Simulations with fast control wires show that flit-reservation flow control extends the 63% throughput attained by virtual-channel flow control with 8 flit buffers per input to 77%, an improvement of 20% with equal storage and bandwidth overheads. Its throughput with 6 buffers (77%) approaches that of virtual-channel flow control using 16 buffers (80%), reflecting the significant buffer savings as a result of efficient buffer utilization. Data latency is also reduced by 15.6% as compared to virtual-channel flow control. The improvement in throughput is similarly realized by the pipelining of each control flit a cycle ahead of their data flits, using control and data networks with the same propagation delay of 1 cycle.	compile time;compiler;computer simulation;control flow;data dependency;dynamic data;flow control (data);network packet;network performance;pipeline (computing);propagation delay;routing;schedule (project management);scheduling (computing);software propagation;traverse;telecommunications network;throughput;virtual channel	Li-Shiuan Peh;William J.

The Internet has special topology and a hierarchy  (AS and router). The topology have power-laws or scale-free property in other words. In this paper, we focused on the network  topology and we applied AntNet algorithm to the network such as the Internet. We examined a node should use either a Loop-Free  algorithm or a non-Loop-Free algorithm depending on its degree in heavy traffic condition. The Loop-Free feature means that  when an ant decides to visit an adjacent node, then the ant selects the next node from its unvisited node. The non-Loop-Free  algorithm is the same to the original AntNet. As a result, we found that network topology affects the ability of AntNet algorithms.    	algorithm	Shigeo Doi;Masayuki Yamamura	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-28646-2_25	routing;telecommunications;distributed computing;computer network	Theory	-9.052284731478276	78.19296225556859	134449

In order to ensure stable services and high availability thereby reducing the downtime, an early detection of fault and early isolation of fault is inevitable. In this paper a novel detection and handling method combining the use of third parties modules with newly developed monitoring device (Tensai Gothalo) is proposed in order to control the network fault that guarantees robustness to network instability and assist the network administrator in making decisions. The proposed approach can be utilized for fault detection and handle those faults by providing alternate network path within a minimal downtime. Furthermore, it considers the potential fault in different segments of networks and explore the methods of restoration of services which are affected due to the faults by providing redundancy in each and every layers. Consideration of redundancy in each layer is applied in order to distribute and shift the burden between the network layers and balance their need for network restoration. Restoration of network services is provided by activating network services in IoT cluster while fault happens in a network. Furthermore, a fault alarm system assisted by Tensai Gothalo is implemented to guarantee the disaster readiness of network services. Finally, the relevant results of the proposed approach are then presented and analyzed.	circuit restoration;downtime;fault detection and isolation;high availability;instability;internet protocol suite;nagios core;networking hardware;redundancy (engineering);sensor;simple network management protocol;software deployment	Bishnu Prasad Gautam;Katsumi Wasaki;Narayan Sharma	2016	2016 International Conference on Networking and Network Applications (NaNA)	10.1109/NaNA.2016.46	fcaps;element management system;real-time computing;intelligent computer network;network architecture;network management station;computer science;fault management;network management application;computer security;software fault tolerance;computer network	Robotics	-18.56076480059207	85.18570921833556	134803

It is important to understand why (and how) this evolution came about, and how the interplay of these dynamics may affect future evolution and services. We propose a network-aware, macroscopic model that captures the characteristics and interactions of the application and network providers, and show how it leads to a market equilibrium of the ecosystem. By analyzing the driving forces and the dynamics of the market equilibrium, we obtain some fundamental understandings of the cause and effect of the Internet evolution, which explain why some historical and recent evolutions have happened. Furthermore, by projecting the likely future evolutions, our model can help application and network providers to make informed business decisions so as to succeed in this competitive ecosystem.	autonomous robot;causality;ecosystem;evolution;interaction;interconnection;internet	Richard T.

However, these SLAs are rather static and span a single provider domain. Thus they are not applicable to a multiâdomain environment and do not enable users with the flexibility to setâup and monitor e2e services. In this paper we present a framework for automatic creation and management of SLAs in a multi-domain environment. The framework is based on Service Oriented Computing (SOC) and contains a collection of web service calls and modules hat allow for the automatic creation, configuration and delivery of an endâ toâend SLA, created from the merging of the perâdomain SLAs. We also present a monitoring procedure to monitor the QoS guarantees stipulated in the SLA. The SLA establishment and monitoring procedures are tested through a Grid application scenario targeted to perform remote control and monitoring of instrument elements distributed across the Grid.	administrative domain;flow-based programming;internet backbone;multi-agent system;national research and education network;network performance;provisioning;quality of service;remote control;service-level agreement;service-oriented architecture;standard sea level;supercomputer;telecommunications network;web service	Vassiliki Pouli;Constantinos Marinos;Mary Grammatikou;Symeon Papavassiliou;Basil S.

Middlebox functionalities are usually deployed on expensive and proprietary hardware that require trained personnel for deployment and maintenance. Middleboxes contribute significantly to a network's capital and operational costs. In addition, organizations often require their traffic to pass through a specific sequence of middleboxes for compliance with security and performance policies. This makes the middlebox deployment and maintenance tasks even more complicated. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is an emerging and promising technology that is envisioned to overcome these challenges. It proposes to move packet processing from dedicated hardware middleboxes to software running on commodity servers. In NFV terminology, software middleboxes are referred to as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). It is a challenging problem to determine the required number and placement of VNFs that optimize network operational costs and utilization, without violating service level agreements. We call this the VNF Orchestration Problem (VNF-OP) and provide an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation with implementation in CPLEX. We also provide a dynamic programming based heuristic to solve larger instances of VNF-OP. Trace driven simulations on real-world network topologies demonstrate that the heuristic can provide solutions that are within 1.3 times of the optimal solution. Our experiments suggest that a VNF based approach can provide more than 4 Ï reduction in the operational cost of a network.	cplex;dynamic programming;experiment;firewall (computing);floor and ceiling functions;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;middlebox;network function virtualization;network packet;network topology;proprietary hardware;proxy server;service-level agreement;simulation;software deployment;wan optimization	Md.

These new paradigms push data storage and delivery at network layer and are designed to better deal with current Internet usage, mainly centered around content dissemination and retrieval. In this paper, we develop an analytical model of CCN in-network storage and receiver-driven transport, that more generally applies to a class of content ori ented networks identified by chunk-based communication. We derive a closed-form expression for the mean stationary throughput as a function of hit/miss probabilities at the caches along the path, of content popularity and of content/cache size. Our analytical results, supported by chunk level simulations, can be used to analyze fundamental trade-offs in current CCN architecture, and provide an essential building block for the design and evaluation of enhanced CCN protocols.	ambiguous name resolution;computer data storage;cyclomatic complexity;digital distribution;embedded system;end-to-end encryption;fairness measure;internet;key;network congestion;pc bruno;performance evaluation;programming paradigm;simulation;slashdot effect;stationary process;steady state;system time;throughput	Giovanna Carofiglio;Massimo Gallo;Luca Muscariello;Diego Perino	2011	2011 23rd International Teletraffic Congress (ITC)		telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;markov process;world wide web;statistics;computer network	Networks	-15.17070284022692	75.95311194149384	135129

However, the intervention of the router is not always an effective solution on ATM network. If there is a direct virtual channel connection between two endpoints on ATM network, they can exchange their information directly without the help of routers. Actually, some groups of IETF and ATM Forum are looking on such tasks. As the results, NHRP (Next Hop Resolution Protocol) or MPOA (Multi-Protocol Over ATM) are being drafted. However, since those protocols are too heavy and complicate, it is not easy to implement. In this paper, we propose a simple efficient solution for inter-LIS communication.

709aac92562aea4d6d47ab4d59162c528298d3f6	netrs: cutting response latency in distributed key-value stores with in-network replica selection		In distributed key-value stores, performance fluctuations generally occur across servers, especially when the servers are deployed in a cloud environment. Hence, the replica selected for a request will directly affect the response latency. In the context of key-value stores, even the state-of-the-art algorithm of replica selection still has considerable room for improving the response latency. In this paper, we present the fundamental factors that prevent replica selection algorithms from being effective. We address these factors by proposing NetRS, a framework that enables in-network replica selection for key-value stores. NetRS exploits emerging network devices, including programmable switches and network accelerators, to select replicas for requests. NetRS supports diverse algorithms of replica selection and is suited to the network topology of modern data centers. Compared with the conventional scheme of clients selecting replicas for requests, NetRS could effectively cut the response latency according to our extensive evaluations. Specifically, NetRS reduces the average latency by up to 48.4%, and the 99th latency by up to 68.7%.	aggregate data;attributeâvalue pair;data center;network packet;network switch;network topology;networking hardware;pipeline (computing);selection algorithm	Yi Su;Dan Feng;Yu Hua;Zhan Shi;Tingwei Zhu	2018	2018 IEEE 38th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)	10.1109/ICDCS.2018.00024	replica;distributed computing;networking hardware;computer network;software;network topology;latency (engineering);cloud computing;computer science;exploit;server	Networks	-13.36433201468435	81.23190960686851	135411

However, the current SCADA systems cannot accommodate the demand of smart grid high data rate applications such as asset monitoring using video surveillance for fault prediction and self-healing purposes. Consequently, wireless networking is envisioned as a strong candidate to extend the monitoring capabilities of SCADA systems with easy-to-deploy high data rate devices. Nevertheless, the limited resources of a single wireless network may not allow transferring a large volume of delay-sensitive smart grid information while satisfying the packet delay requirements. This paper investigates, via a hardware measurement-based study, the packet delay performance of multihomed wireless transceivers. Multihomed transceivers are capable of sending different data packets (not packet replicas) over heterogeneous wireless networks simultaneously. The paper also offers a packet delay analysis for dual-homed wireless nodes connected to a WiFi network via one of their interfaces. A comparative experimental and analytical study is conducted for the delay performance of single-interface WiFi transceivers and multihomed transceivers. Our results show that the traffic load distribution among different interfaces has a significant impact on the effectiveness of using multihoming for smart grids.	closed-circuit television;data acquisition;data rate units;dual-homed;experiment;interference (communication);load balancing (computing);multihoming;network packet;requirement;transceiver;uncompressed video;vii;wireless access point	Atef Amin Abdrabou;Hosam Hittini;Khaled Bashir Shaban	2016	2016 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium (WTS)	10.1109/WTS.2016.7482040	embedded system;telecommunications;engineering;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;computer network	Mobile	-18.450927093533085	85.34181819968384	135834

This evolution is enabled by three paradigms. First, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) allows network control to be separated from the forwarding plane and allows for a flexible management of the network resources. Second, Network Virtualization (NV) brings virtualization concepts to the network, similar to cloud computing, which was enabled by virtualization of servers. Third, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) focuses on virtualization of software-based network functions. Instead of installing and managing dedicated hardware devices for these functions, they are implemented as software components and deployed on commodity hardware infrastructures, in most cases operated by a network operator or cloud infrastructure provider. Service Function Chaining (SFC) consists of building services using virtual network functions (VNFs). These three paradigms are synergetic and reinforce each other when used together. Several initial SDN, NV and NFV deployments are already operational in providersâ networks.

Simple routing of flows from ingress to egress along shortest paths has been replaced by policy aware paths that have to pass through the required set of middleboxes. The complex routing is one of the major impetus for the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm. In this paper, we consider both offline planning and online routing problems in SDN framework. The offline planning problem is one where aggregate demands are specified and the objective is to determine whether there is enough capacity in the network to handle the demands. We develop a fast FPTAS for the problem based on segmentation and lazy dual update. In the online routing problem, flow requests are given one at a time and the objective is to steer the flows to maximize the total amount of traffic accepted over time. We develop a log-competitive algorithm based on time-dependent duals.	aggregate data;algorithm;data center;egress filtering;lazy evaluation;middlebox;online and offline;polynomial-time approximation scheme;programming paradigm;routing;shortest path problem;software-defined networking	Zizhong Cao;Murali S.

It leads to a large interleaving between network configuration through software defined network controllers and VNF deployment within this network. Most of the configuration management tools and network orchestrators used to deploy VNF lack of an abstraction to express Assume-Guarantee contracts between the VNF and the SDN configuration. Consequently, VNF deployment can be inconsistent with network configurations. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present an approach to check the consistency between the VNF description described from a set of structural models and flow-chart models and a proposed deployment on a real SDN infrastructure with its own configuration manager. We illustrate our approach on virtualized Evolved Packet Core function.	automation;cognitive dimensions of notations;configuration management;correctness (computer science);data center;flowchart;forward error correction;holism;instance (computer science);introspection;microservices;network function virtualization;network switch;semantics (computer science);software deployment;software-defined networking;universal instantiation	Johan Pelay;Fabrice Guillemin;Olivier Barais	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN)	10.1109/NFV-SDN.2017.8169874	software deployment;software;virtual network;software-defined networking;cloud computing;configuration management;network packet;distributed computing;server;computer science	Networks	-14.952060426524497	82.98723573938658	136399

Shifts in user behavior, changes in routing policies, and failures of network elements can result in significant (and sudden) fluctuations in load. In this paper, we present a model of traffic demands to support traffic engineering and performance debugging of large Internet Service Provider networks. By defining a traffic demand as a volume of load originating from an ingress link and destined to a set of egress links, we can capture and predict how routing affects the traffic traveling between domains. To infer the traffic demands, we propose a measurement methodology that combines flow-level measurements collected at all ingress links with reachability information about all egress links. We discuss how to cope with situations where practical considerations limit the amount and quality of the necessary data. Specifically, we show how to infer interdomain traffic demands using measurements collected at a smaller number of edge links-the peering links connecting the neighboring providers. We report on our experiences in deriving the traffic demands in the AT&T IP BAckbone, by collecting, validating, and joining very large and diverse sets of usage, configuration, and routing data over extended periods of time. The paper concludes with a preliminary analysis of the observed dynamics of the traffic demands and a discussion of the practical implications for traffic engineering.	debugging;egress filtering;experience;inter-domain;internet backbone;internet protocol suite;peering;reachability;routing table	Anja Feldmann;Albert G.

07054ae623040dc9c308be0df9a5b0ddd5aa1f0d	introducing development features for virtualized network services		Network virtualization and softwarizing network functions are trends aiming at higher network efficiency, cost reduction and agility. They are driven by the evolution in Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This shows that software will play an increasingly important role within telecommunication services, which were previously dominated by hardware appliances. Service providers can benefit from this, as it enables faster introduction of new telecom services, combined with an agile set of possibilities to optimize and fine-tune their operations. However, the provided telecom services can only evolve if the adequate software tools are available. In this article, we explain how the development, deployment and maintenance of such an SDN/NFV-based telecom service puts specific requirements on the platform providing it. A Software Development Kit (SDK) is introduced, allowing service providers to adequately design, test and evaluate services before they are deployed in production and also update them during their lifetime. This continuous cycle between development and operations, a concept known as DevOps, is a well known strategy in software development. To extend its context further to SDN/NFV-based services, the functionalities provided by traditional cloud platforms are not yet sufficient. By giving an overview of the currently available tools and their limitations, the gaps in DevOps for SDN/NFV services are highlighted. The benefit of such an SDK is illustrated by a secure content delivery network service (enhanced with deep packet inspection and elastic routing capabilities). With this use-case, the dynamics between developing and deploying a service are further illustrated.	agile software development;content delivery network;deep packet inspection;devops;digital distribution;network function virtualization;network packet;requirement;routing;software deployment;software development kit;software-defined networking	Steven van Rossem;Wouter Tavernier;Didier Colle;Mario Pickavet;Piet Demeester	2018	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2018.1600104	software deployment;service provider;network virtualization;computer network;cloud computing;software-defined networking;software development;devops;computer science;agile software development	Networks	-15.899642823549112	85.37999489310477	136646

Efficiently grooming low-speed connections onto high-capacity lightpaths will improve the network throughput and reduce the network cost. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new concept of traffic aggregation in WDM mesh networks that aims to eliminate both the bandwidth under-utilization and scalability concerns that are typical in all-optical wavelength routed networks. This approach relies on the multipoint-to-point lightpath concept. In order to assess the efficiency of our proposal, all underlying network costs are compared. To achieve this aim, we devise a new provisioning algorithm to map the multipoint-to-point lightpaths in the network. Our results show that the proposed aggregation technique can significantly improve the network throughput while reducing its cost.	multipoint ground;provisioning	Nizar Bouabdallah;Guy Pujolle	2005	Int.

20f90bb05775b8706fd445a73098252d4f2ce9cd	enhancing metaheuristic-based online embedding in network virtualization environments		Virtual network embedding (VNE) has attracted a lot of attention in the last decade. Nevertheless, recent analysis demonstrates that the performance of VNE solutions in key metrics like virtualized network acceptance ratio decreases drastically with medium-to-large sizes of substrate and virtual networks. This paper proposes a constraint management approach that grades the quality of VNE candidate solutions according to the degree of fulfillment of their constraints and exploits this information to drive the metaheuristics to more promising regions of the search process enhancing their performance. Through simulation and formal statistical analysis, our approach has been proved to enhance VNE acceptance ratio practically at no time overhead. Formal statistical analysis and comparison with the literature demonstrate that our approach enhances the quality of embeddings and that such enhancements are more accentuated in large sizes of substrate networks, where the performance of standard metaheuristics decreases drastically.	heuristic;hyper-heuristic;metaheuristic;nv network;overhead (computing);simulation	Javier Rubio-Loyola;Christian Aguilar-Fuster;Gregorio Toscano Pulido;Rashid Mijumbi;Joan Serrat	2018	IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management	10.1109/TNSM.2017.2742666	virtual network;genetic algorithm;network virtualization;theory of constraints;quality of service;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;metaheuristic;exploit;computer science;particle swarm optimization	Visualization	-9.070411613477415	82.67544193002078	136966

By removing the complex pieces of the service logic from the equipment in the customer premises, and by placing them in a virtualized software instance running inside the Service Provider's datacenter, relevant Operational and Capital Expenditure (CAPEX and OPEX) savings can be obtained. CAPEX savings are achieved by reducing the complexity of the piece of hardware to be deployed at the customer premises, or by extending the life cycle of existing devices already deployed. Potential OPEX savings are even larger: the complex logic of the service implementation (the software complexity) is under more manageable control of the service provider, thus enabling simpler troubleshooting and software upgrades, and reducing technical support calls and truck rolls. Hardware development is simplified as the service complexity is implemented in software with a continuous development model, thus reducing the time to market for new services whilst maintaining consistency of service regardless of hardware in the home. This model is enabled by the latest advances in the networking stack of the Linux kernel (which allow to implement network functions as programs running in kernel space), coupled with the use of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). The combination of these technologies allows controlling the broadband service in the cloud, while maintaining local, on-premises service enforcement, security and address management.	cloud computing;constant phase element;data center;itil;linux;network function virtualization;on-premises software;online savings account;programming complexity;protocol stack;remote control;software-defined networking;technical support;user space;while	Fernando Sanchez;David Brazewell	2015	Proceedings of the 2015 1st IEEE Conference on Network Softwarization (NetSoft)	10.1109/NETSOFT.2015.7116166	embedded system;computer science;operating system;linux kernel;computer network	Networks	-15.537647166837552	84.36229776444351	137025

Email: stguo@swu.edu.cn Summary Multi-domain multi-controller software-defined networks have an inevitable potential to improve the scalability and reliability of massive data center networks because the single controller cannot match the rapid expansion of cloud computing. The inconsistency among controllers can significantly degrade the network performance, because of that the data center network in software-defined networks has physically distributed control plane but operates with logically centralized plane. Existing synchronization among multi-controllers is based on the periodic synchronization (PS) that is stiffly triggered by time. However, the PS neglects potential inconsistency and further produces much packet loss and poor load balance in the whole network. Longer synchronization period increases synchronization overhead and decreases network performance. To keep the load consistency among controllers, we propose an active synchronization algorithm that is agilely triggered by event, ie, synchronization is triggered when the load of specific server exceeds the average load of its domain. With such an event triggered mechanism, we cannot only eliminate the correlation between synchronization and time but also avoid forwarding loop in the global network. Simulation results show that compared to existing PS-based schemes, our active synchronization algorithm can achieve better load balance with less synchronization overhead and lower packet loss rate.	algorithm;centralized computing;cloud computing;control plane;data center;distributed control system;domain controller;email;global network;information engineering;load balancing (computing);network packet;network performance;overhead (computing);queueing theory;scalability;server (computing);simulation;software-defined networking;synchronization (computer science);testbed	Yuxue Zou;Yueyang Tian;Songtao Guo;Yan Wu	2017	Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience	10.1002/cpe.3979	computer science;distributed computing;control theory;parallel computing;real-time computing;packet loss;scalability;synchronization;synchronization (computer science);network performance;data synchronization;load balancing (computing)	OS	-10.348372440048086	79.66453080733136	137083

Conventional schemes place security devices (middleboxes) at a few choke points (e.g., core routers) and rely on routing policy to guarantee middlebox traversal. Coupling routing and security services together complicates operation and troubleshooting since routing and security are operated by different teams. When a data center scales, the security system needs upgrade accordingly. However, the current approaches are not flexible and incur high cost. Observing that rich computing resources are already available in data centers, we are interested in using a large number of software middleboxes to achieve scalability and cost efficiency. We present Hybrid Security Architecture (HSA), a design to decouple security services from routing and to allow the integration of hardware and software middleboxes in a complementary way. HSA is more cost-effective and flexible compared to the conventional schemes that solely use hardware middleboxes. It allows topology and routing changes with minimal impact to security services, and vice versa. In particular, HSA does not require modification to switches and routers. This paper explains the framework of HSA, describes the key techniques, presents a testbed to validate the design, and discusses future research directions.	application security;computer security;cost efficiency;data center;heterogeneous system architecture;middlebox;multitenancy;network switch;provisioning;router (computing);routing;scalability;security service (telecommunication);testbed;virtual machine	Ho-Yu Lam;Song Xian Zhao;Kang Xi;H.

However, the exact specifications of the edge that give the most benefit for each type of application are still unclear. We investigate the concrete conditions when the edge is feasible, i.e., when users observe performance gains from the edge while costs remain low for the providers, for an application that requires both low latency and high bandwidth: video analytics.	edge computing;video content analysis	Faria Kalim;Shadi A.

Big data capability thus available throughout such networks will not only deliver enhanced system performance, but also profoundly impact the design and standardization of the next-generation network architecture, protocol stack, signaling procedure, and physical- layer processing. In this article, a mobile network architecture enabled by big data analytics is proposed, which is capable of efficient resource orchestration, content distribution, and radio access network optimization. The protocol stack configuration at each access point and the processing optimization of each layer are presented. Key physical layer designs including reference signals and frame structure are discussed. Moreover, utilizing signals in the transform domains, such as delay, Doppler, and angle, may bring enlarged coherence time of the effective channels. It enables much simpler physical layer design, and effectively bridges the latency gap between big data cloud computing and real-time network optimization.	big data;centralized computing;cloud computing;digital distribution;mathematical optimization;network architecture;next-generation network;protocol stack;radio access network;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time operating system;tag cloud;telecommunications network;wireless access point	Shuangfeng Han;I Chih-Lin;Gang Li;Sen Wang;Qi Sun	2017	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600911	computer science;network architecture;computer network;mobile search;radio access network;architecture;physical layer;distributed computing;cloud computing;mobile computing;cellular network	Mobile	-14.559978351648608	85.97100700501431	137264
dd82357976d068e17074197d6098b81006cc82a7	a novel fault tolerance parallel routing mechanism with network coding in hybrid wireless-optical broadband access network		Survivability is the critical issue in the wirelessoptical broadband access network (WOBAN) since that any failure of network components would resulted in a large amount of traffic interrupted. The previous mechanisms suffer from two key issues. First, they must reroute the interrupted traffic to the backup resources which caused a long recovery time. Second, the deployment of backup fiber could increase the recovery cost. To address these problems, a novel fault tolerance parallel routing mechanism with network coding (FTPR-NC) is proposed in this paper to enhance the survivability. In FTPR-NC mechanism, the original packets are coded to the optimal number of encoded packets which results in the minimum cost of recovery. Then the encoded packet is transferred to the destination node in accordance with the packet allocation scheme which results in the minimum number of encoded packet when recover the original packets by parallel routings. Numerical results show that the proposed FTPR-NC mechanism outperforms the previous mechanism significantly on the performance of average delay. Meanwhile, the FTPR-NC mechanism dramatically decrease the recovery time when a failure occurs.	access network;backup;fault tolerance;internet access;interrupt;linear network coding;nc (complexity);network packet;routing;simulation;software deployment	Hong Zhang;Ruyan Wang;Honggang Wang;Guangkai Wu	2018	2018 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2018.8390399	fault tolerance;computer network;linear network coding;survivability;software deployment;network packet;broadband;backup;access network;computer science	HPC	-7.561596199937459	82.23933055459781	137475

In order to alleviate the mismatching problem, we propose adaptive connection establishment (ACE), an algorithm of building an overlay multicast tree among each source node and the peers within a certain diameter from the source peer, and further optimizing the neighbor connections that are not on the tree, while retaining the search scope. Our simulation study shows that this approach can effectively solve the mismatching problem and significantly reduce P2P traffic. We further study the tradeoffs between the topology optimization rate and the information exchange overhead by changing the diameter used to build the tree.	ace;algorithm;information exchange;mathematical optimization;multicast;overhead (computing);overlay network;peer-to-peer;randomness;simulation;topology optimization	Yunhao Liu;Zhenyun Zhuang;Li Xiao;Lionel M.

Fundamentally, failure recovery is achieved by provisioning backup paths on standby network resources to provide traffic rerouting for bypassing a failed device. Unlike survivable network designs, the principle used in designing a green network is the opposite. To minimize energy consumption, traffic engineering techniques are applied to aggregate traffic flows on limited network resources. Thus, the unused network devices can be turned off or put on sleep mode to save power. How to reduce power consumption while maintaining high survivability is quite challenging. In this paper, we first evaluate the required number of active links for an IP network operating at its maximum survivability ratio. The results indicate that power saving is quite limited using standard IPFRR. We identify that this result comes from the inflexibility of IP routing using only one set of link metrics. To resolve this issue, we introduced RFC 4915 MTR into the design of a novel green IP network. The method we proposed uses only two routing configurations. Configuration 1 is used for routing traffic in the normal state and Configuration 2 is used to compensate Configuration 1 to enhance network survivability. We have formulated the problem as an integer linear programming problem and propose an optimization-based approach to obtain a solution. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method is not only energy efficient but also can provide 100% network survivability against any single link failure.	aggregate data;algorithm;apollonian network;backup;failover;fast reroute;integer programming;internet protocol suite;mtr;marginal model;mathematical optimization;national supercomputer centre in sweden;network planning and design;numerical analysis;provisioning;routing;single point of failure;sleep mode	Steven S.

ade31fe59a4665823c3316056014d4a86e20118d	internet on the road via inter-vehicle communications	traffic flow;data exchange	Driving means constantly changing location. This, in turn, means a constant demand for information on the current location and specifically for data on the surrounding traffic. In particular, there is a demand for sensor data from other cars such as data on braking sent from a preceding car, for data on the traffic flow on a route, and for information about sites located along a route. Although need for information pertaining to the close environment of the car is obvious, so far no intervehicle communications system for data exchange between vehicles and between roadside and vehicles has been put into operation. To promote the development of such an inter-vehicle communication system, the project âFleetNet â Internet on the Roadâ was set up by a consortium of six companies and three universities: DaimlerChrysler AG, GMD FOKUS, NEC Europe Ltd., Robert Bosch GmbH, Siemens AG, TEMIC TELEFUNKEN microelectronic GmbH, Universities of Mannheim and Hannover, and Technische UniversitÃ¤t Hamburg-Harburg. The project is partly funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research. FleetNet started on September 1, 2000 and will end on December 31, 2003. FleetNet aims at the development and demonstration of a wireless ad hoc network for inter-vehicle communications. Key design requirements for FleetNet are the capability to distribute locally relevant data where generated and needed and to satisfy the vehicle driversâ and passengersâ needs for location-dependent information and services. Location awareness and position data play a crucial role not only for FleetNet applications but also for the communication protocols deployed. This paper provides an overview of the FleetNet project: we describe FleetNet applications and services as well as Fleetnetâs technical challenges together with our current design choices.	general material designation;hoc (programming language);inter-process communication;internet;location awareness;prototype;requirement;stationary process;test-driven development;vehicle information and communication system	Walter J.

Signaling is used to support connection setup, maintenance, and teardown in such a network. In this paper, we study the performance of two hop-by-hop and one parallel signaling schemes in wavelength-routed optical mesh networks. Based on the sequence between optical crossconnect (OXC) switching and signaling message processing, we classify hop-by-hop signaling into two types that comply with the requirements of GMPLS signaling protocols. These two types are forward before switching configuration (FBSC) and forward after switching configuration (FASC). Also, we propose a parallel signaling scheme that is different from the existing hop-by-hop GMPLS signaling protocols. Considering OXC architectures and traffic patterns, we compare the FBSC, FASC, and parallel signaling schemes using simulation experiments, in terms of network blocking probability and reservation time. The simulation data reveal that the performance of a signaling scheme depends on the nature of the signaling as well as the network setting (e.g., the OXC architecture and traffic pattern). We analyze reasons for this result and discuss tradeoffs between these signaling schemes. This work offers some insight into designing an efficient signaling protocol for wavelength-routed optical mesh networks.	blocking (computing);erlang (unit);experiment;generalized multi-protocol label switching;hop-by-hop transport;mesh networking;optical cross-connect;optical mesh network;point-to-point protocol;provisioning;requirement;routing;scalability;signaling protocol;simulation;software maintenance;switching time;wavelength-division multiplexing	Lu Shen;Xi Yang;Byrav Ramamurthy	2004	Photonic Network Communications	10.1023/B:PNET.0000031620.07210.d5	optical transport network;telecommunications;point-to-point;computer science;mesh networking;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-11.797041374989893	84.41483991852411	138133

Second, a logically-centralized OpenBox controller is able to merge logic of multiple NFs, possibly from multiple tenants, and to use a network-wide view to efficiently deploy and scale NFs across the network data plane. Finally, OpenBox instances constitute OpenBoxâs data plane and are implemented either purely in software or contain specific hardware accelerators (e.g., a TCAM). In practice, different NFs carry out similar processing steps on the same packet, and our experiments indeed show a significant improvement of the network performance when using OpenBox. Moreover, OpenBox readily supports smart NF placement, NF scaling, and multi-tenancy through its controller.	application programming interface;centralized computing;control plane;experiment;forwarding plane;hardware acceleration;image scaling;multitenancy;network packet;network performance;new foundations;software deployment;software-defined networking;telecommunications access method	Anat Bremler-Barr;Yotam Harchol;David Hay	2016		10.1145/2934872.2934875	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;software-defined networking;computer security;computer network	Networks	-14.6633303862919	82.3362436871152	138163

Among them, the 4over6/6over4 edge network tunneling technique has become a particular hot subject recently. To apply this technique into real ISP networks, there is a practical problem: planning the placement of the tunnel concentrators and the routing of the tunneling flows. The problem is essential to the performance and efficiency of data transport in IPv4-IPv6 coexisting network. As the first effort to address this problem, this paper formalizes the problem and builds the optimization model. It proves the problem to be NP-complete and locates the difficulties in the variable diversity and the hub and unsplittable flow features. A novel scheme is then proposed to find an approximate solution. The scheme decomposes the problem and explores the flow routing variability. It eliminates the hub feature by sophisticated topology transformation, and solves the min-cost unsplittable flow problem by shortest path routing of each individual flow along with minimum-interference to other flows. With acceptable time efficiency, the scheme finds better solutions than greedy algorithm and former minimum-interference routing algorithms in most cases.	approximation algorithm;coexist (image);flow network;greedy algorithm;interference (communication);interoperability;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;np-completeness;network performance;routing;shortest path problem;spatial variability;the hub (forum);tunneling protocol;usb hub	Peng Wu;Yong Cui;Jianping Wu;Minming Li	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC)	10.1109/ICCW.2013.6649439	planning;interoperability;routing;np-complete;minimum-cost flow problem;multi-commodity flow problem;telecommunications;computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;interference;quantum tunnelling;open system;computational complexity theory;computer network;traffic optimization	Embedded	-5.153454686950951	82.1218723351694	138201

Issues like congestion avoidance, resource management, resource discovery, root-cause analysis and event correlation require accurate information of the topology map. Due to dynamic nature of todayâs IP networks, keeping track of topology information manually is a daunting task. Thus efficient algorithms for automatically discovering physical network topology are necessary. The earlier work has typically concentrated on discovering topology either using completely SNMP-MIB or ICMP echo request/reply, DNS, Trace route, etc. Our proposed algorithm does not rely totally on SNMP-MIB information as it is not usually supported by all devices in the network. Instead we propose an approach where SNMP agent should only be enabled on the routers and managed switches. Rest of the network computers/hosts need not have SNMP agent enabled. We propose an efficient algorithm not only to find available computers/hosts but also to find appropriate timeouts and delays in the network. The experimental results validate our approach, demonstrating that our algorithm discovers accurate physical topology.	algorithm;computer;entity;event correlation;internet protocol suite;map;mebibyte;network congestion;network switch;network topology;ping (networking utility);requestâresponse;router (computing);simple network management protocol;software agent;subnetwork;telecommunications network;traceroute	Fawad Nazir;Mohsan Jameel;Tallat Hussain Tarar;Hamid Abbas Burki;Hafiz Farooq Ahmad;Arshad Ali;Hiroki Suguri	2006	11th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC'06)	10.1109/ISCC.2006.30	network management;data link layer;information and communications technology;root cause analysis;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;event correlation;resource management;operating system;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security;network topology;network layer;computer network;logical topology	Metrics	-18.821953690558534	84.24334204108052	138639
24cd063264cad8eaeab35707f6dff099bf400894	a methodology for physical interconnection decisions of next generation transport networks	network planning;transport networks;physical interconnection;heuristics;optical infrastructure	The physical interconnection for optical transport networks has critical relevance in the overall network performance and deployment costs. As telecommunication services and technologies evolve, the provisioning of higher capacity and reliability levels is becoming essential for the proper development of Next Generation Networks. Currently, there is a lack of specific procedures that describe the basic guidelines to design such networks better than âbest possible performance for the lowest investmentâ. Therefore, the research from different points of view will allow a broader space of possibilities when designing the physical network interconnection. This paper develops and presents a methodology in order to deal with aspects related to the interconnection problem of optical transport networks. This methodology is presented as independent puzzle pieces, covering diverse topics going from novel design criteria to well-known organized topologies. These can be used to investigate the influence of the physical interconnection of networks over their performance properties, and draw conclusions to improve the current decision support techniques related to this theme. In addition, several examples of the use of this methodology are presented.	analysis of algorithms;decision support system;interconnection;network performance;network topology;next-generation network;provisioning;quality of service;relevance;routing;software deployment;theory;transport layer security	JosÃ© M.

c3b5af198471130aa1023f7d3296bd4f45117eb2	unified nvtcam and stcam architecture for improving packet matching performance		Software-Defined Networking (SDN) allows controlling applications to install fine-grained forwarding policies in the underlying switches. Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) enables fast lookups in hardware switches with flexible wildcard rule patterns. However, the performance of packet processing is severely constrained by the capacity of TCAM, which aggravates the processing burden and latency issues. In this paper, we propose a hybrid TCAM architecture which consists of NVM-based TCAM (nvTCAM) and SRAM-based TCAM (sTCAM), utilizing nvTCAM to cache the most popular rules to improve cache-hit-ratio while relying on a very small-size sTCAM to handle cache-miss traffic to effectively decrease update latency. Considering the special rule dependency, we present an efficient Rule Migration Replacement (RMR) policy to make full utilization of both nvTCAM and sTCAM to obtain better performance. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture outperforms current TCAM architectures.	cpu cache;content-addressable memory;network packet;network switch;non-volatile memory;software-defined networking;static random-access memory;telecommunications access method	Xianzhong Ding;Zhiyong Zhang;Zhiping Jia;Lei Ju;Mengying Zhao;Huawei Huang	2017		10.1145/3078633.3081034	real-time computing;content-addressable memory;architecture;parallel computing;cache;latency (engineering);software-defined networking;packet processing;network packet;computer science;ternary operation	OS	-13.58036570655097	81.56926095645551	139332
c2276bd1fc2638bd5148c19fabc3c9b1e9a10b86	a popularity-based collaborative caching algorithm for content-centric networking		ï âThe key aspect of Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is that the contents are cached by in-network nodes, and hence the caching scheme is important for the efficient use of cache and content delivery. Although the caching scheme in CCN has been widely researched, it is still a great challenge to better utilize in-network caching of CCN with an appropriate caching scheme. In this paper, we propose an effective popularity-based collaborative caching algorithm with the idea to reduce content redundancy within network and make popular contents near clients. The algorithm is lightweight and implicit collaborative with real-time analysis local popularity and little change to the pipeline of CCN. We also analyze that the proposed algorithm is suitable for solving the lack of contents and high external bandwidth charge problems of China Mobile Communications Corporation. The algorithm is simulated with many factors that may have impacts on the performance, and our algorithm is effective, scalable and stable for various topologies, popularity estimate methods and features. The results of simulation show that our algorithm outperforms the existing classical algorithm in access hops and server hit proportion.	algorithm;cpu cache;cache (computing);cyclomatic complexity;digital distribution;real-time clock;scalability;server (computing);simulation	Xiaodong Zhu;Weining Qi;Jinlin Wang;Yiqiang Sheng	2016	JCM	10.12720/jcm.11.10.886-895	active networking;distributed computing	Web+IR	-15.020886918102718	75.16421737540328	139731

We present a greedy algorithm to solve the problem and an explicit formula for the maximum number of requests that can be groomed. In particular, if C = s(s+1)/2 and N \ge s(s-1), an optimal solution is obtained by taking all the requests of smallest length, that is of length 1 to s.

No holistic and adaptive approach exists that can manage all technologies and devices at once. To this extent, we previously proposed the inter-technology management framework ORCHESTRA. The framework is the first of its kind in providing fine-grained packet-level control across different network technologies in a network-wide manner.

The cost and energy consumption have become the most important challenges of building those data centers. Data centers today use commodity computers and switches instead of high-end servers and interconnections for cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a new type of interconnection networks called <italic>Exchanged Cube-Connected Cycles (ExCCC)</italic>. The <italic>ExCCC</italic> network is an extension of <italic>Exchanged Hypercube (EH)</italic> network by replacing each node with a cycle. The <italic>EH</italic> network is based on link removal from a <italic>Hypercube</italic> network, which makes the <italic>EH</italic> network more cost-effective as it scales up. After analyzing the topological properties of <italic>ExCCC</italic>, we employ commodity switches to construct a new class of data center network models, namely <italic>ExCCC-DCN</italic>, by leveraging the advantages of the <italic>ExCCC</italic> architecture. The analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed <italic>ExCCC-DCN</italic> models significantly outperform four state-of-the-art data center network models in terms of the total cost, power consumption, scalability, and other static characteristics. It achieves the goals of low cost, low energy consumption, high network throughput, and high scalability simultaneously.	cube;cube-connected cycles;data center;dynamic circuit network;interconnection;mainframe computer;network switch;scalability;throughput	Zhen Zhang;Yuhui Deng;Geyong Min;Junjie Xie;Shuqiang Huang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2016.2609428	data modeling;data center;parallel computing;scalability;cost-effectiveness analysis;computer science;operating system;interconnection;database;network simulation;distributed computing;network topology;server;hypercube;computer network	Networks	-11.846642850350637	80.4395727906175	139901

Most existing QoS routing algorithms employ the strategy of unidirectional search in route selection. Bidirectional search has been recognized as an effective strategy for fast route acquisition in identifying the shortest path connecting a pair of nodes. However, its efficiency has not been well established in the context of route selection subject to multiple additive constraints, which is in general NP-Complete. In this paper, we study how to employ bidirectional search to support efficient QoS routing subject to multiple additive constraints. The major contributions in this paper are as follows. First, we propose a k shortest path algorithm using bidirectional search, whose complexity is deduced to be O(âk|V |lg(|V |) + k|E|), where |V | and |E | represent the number of nodes and links in the network, respectively. Second, we show that bidirectional search can significantly accelerate the convergence of several existing QoS routing algorithms. Third, we propose a novel cost-effective bidirectional multi-constrained routing algorithm, which can greatly alleviate the forwarding state scalability issue by supporting stateless QoS routing in IP networks via IP tunneling or constraints-based alternate routing in MPLS networks via label stacks. It has the fastest known on-line running time O(|V|). Theoretical and simulation results are given to demonstrate the high performance of our proposed algorithm in identifying QoS-satisfied paths and also in efficient resource utilization as compared with existing algorithms.	approximation algorithm;bidirectional associative memory;bidirectional search;dijkstra's algorithm;fastest;internet;mcop;multiprotocol label switching;np-completeness;nonlinear system;online and offline;quality of service;routing;scalability;shortest path problem;simulation;stateless protocol;time complexity;tunneling protocol;utility functions on indivisible goods	Baoxian Zhang;Jie Hao;H.

This paper presents a new approach to studying this problem. In particular, we devise a topology-aware measure on node resources based on random walks and use it to rank a nodeâs resources and topological attributes. We then devise a greedy algorithm that matches nodes in the VN to nodes in the substrate network according to node ranks. In most situations there exist multiple embedding solutions, and so we want to find the best embedding that increases the possibility of accepting future VN requests and optimizes the revenue for the provider of the substrate network. We present an integer linear programming formulation for this optimization problem when path splitting is not allowed. We then devise a fast-convergent discrete Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to approximate this problem. Extensive simulation results show that our algorithms produce near optimal solutions and significantly outperform existing algorithms in terms of the ratio of the long-term average revenue over the VN request acceptance. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This technique handles signaling tasks, admission control and contention resolution. We develop a scalable admission control and planning formulation approach based on buffering and transmission capabilities, and traffic requirements.

Meanwhile, fueled by the explosive growth of video traffic and HTTP infrastructure (e.g., CDNs, web caches), HTTP has became the de-facto protocol for deploying new services and applications. Given these developments, we argue that these architectures should be evaluated not only with respect to IP, but also with respect to HTTP, and that HTTP could be a fertile ground (more so than IP) for deploying the newly proposed functionalities. In this paper, we take a step in this direction, and find that HTTP already provides many of the desired properties for new Internet architectures. HTTP is a content centric protocol, provides middlebox support in the form of reverse and forward proxies, and leverages DNS to decouple names from addresses. We then investigate HTTP's limitations, and propose an extension, called S-GET that provides support for low-latency applications, such as VoIP and chat.	future internet;hypertext transfer protocol;middlebox;waistâhip ratio;web cache	Lucian Popa;Ali Ghodsi;Ion Stoica	2010		10.1145/1868447.1868453	forward secrecy;network architecture;border gateway protocol;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network;low latency	Networks	-15.654359172111302	83.61868080537585	140503

Previously, driver code was hidden in the kernel and rarely modified-or even looked at-by developers working at higher layers. These barriers are gone nowadays, yet developers still treat user space drivers as black-boxes magically accelerating applications. We want to change this: every researcher building network applications should understand the intricacies of the underlying drivers, especially if they impact performance. We present ixy, a user space network driver designed for simplicity and educational purposes. Ixy focuses on the bare essentials of user space packet processing: a packet forwarder including the whole NIC driver uses less than 1000 lines of C code.

bedc788696cdb9bb32b7abbe8d49dd2cda49f9c6	receiving-capacity-constrained rapid and fair disaster backup for multiple datacenters in sdn		To prevent data losses and service interruptions caused by natural disasters or human misconduct, we need to leverage periodic disaster backup among geographically distributed multiple datacenters. Previous works aimed at bandwidth allocation to achieve maximum network flow for every backup pair one by one or fair load distribution for backup datacenters respectively, without jointly optimizing the two problems to realize rapid and fair disaster backup. In this paper, we propose a new Receiving-Capacity-Constrained Rapid and Fair Disaster Backup strategy in the Software Defined Network scenarios. We formulate the disaster backup problem as a Receiving-Capacity-Constrained Capacitated Multi-Commodity Flow problem which is NP-complete. To solve the problem, we first construct a new effective Receiving-Capacity-Aware network model guaranteeing upper bound of bandwidth allocation to achieve fair load distribution for backup datacenters. And in this network model, we further propose a Bound-Aware Ant Colony Optimization algorithm satisfying backup flow constraint and lower bound constraint to achieve fast data transmission for backup pairs. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our strategy has better performance with less total backup time and more fair load distribution than state-of-the-art algorithms.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;backup;branch and bound;business architecture;flow network;load balancing (computing);multi-commodity flow problem;multipath routing;np-completeness;network model;regular expression;simulation;software-defined networking	Xiaole Li;Hua Wang;Shanwen Yi;Xibo Yao	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7996677	ant colony optimization algorithms;real-time computing;computer network;flow network;network model;computer science;channel allocation schemes;algorithm design;software-defined networking;backup;bandwidth allocation	Networks	-6.123130777586475	82.1531999589051	140628

For a multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) based backbone network, the fault-tolerant issue focuses on how to protect the traffic of a label switched paths (LSP) against node and link failures. In IETF, two well-known recovery mechanisms (protection switching and rerouting) have been proposed. To further enhance the fault-tolerant performance of the two recovery mechanisms, the proposed approach utilizes the failure-free LSPs to transmit the traffic of the failed LSP (the affected traffic). To avoid affecting the original traffic of each failure-free LSP, the proposed approach applies the solution of the minimum cost flow to determine the amount of affected traffic to be transmitted by each failure-free LSP. For transmitting the affected traffic along a failure-free working LSP, IP tunneling technique is used. We also propose a permission token scheme to solve the packet disorder problem. Finally, simulation experiments are performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	multiprotocol label switching	Jenn-Wei Lin;Huang-Yu Liu	2010	Journal of Systems and Software	10.1016/j.jss.2009.10.043	multiprotocol label switching;label distribution protocol;fault tolerance;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer security;computer network	OS	-7.524369672191713	81.14891495344517	140634

3cfb925ea7e513437683cc2f1447e328f4a2ddf6	reliable broadcasting in 5g nfv-based networks		The emerging 5G technology will support high data rates with low latency and high levels of reliability. To satisfy these requirements, mobile operators have deployed enhancements to LTE networks in a move toward the development of future 5G networks. One of these enhancements is the LTE-broadcasting service. Another enhancement is the employment of network functions virtualization, which will provide elasticity of resources, scalability, and flexibility. In a virtualized LTE-broadcasting network, the main components of the LTE-broadcasting service will be implemented as VNFs. This article introduces a scheme to determine the number of redundant VNF components necessary to satisfy the reliability requirements of broadcasting services in 5G networks. A series-parallel redundant model determines the optimum number of virtual components instantiated to achieve a required service reliability level. The model is compared to a parallel-series one and shown to achieve greater effectiveness, achieving five nines reliability and promoting low end-to-end delay.	compaq lte;elasticity (data store);end-to-end principle;high availability;network function virtualization;reliability engineering;requirement;scalability;series-parallel graph	Hernani D.

We propose to apply k shortest simple paths as the multiple paths between an edge and the center router of a network and also try to disperse the traffic between them. The new heuristic k shortest simple path algorithm proposed in this paper is called k-shortest paths first (k-SPF), and it creates k shortest simple paths faster than the conventional Yen's algorithm does. In addition, we will make it clear that applying k shortest simple paths is not sufficient for further dispersing traffic flows without making bottleneck links that lack available bandwidth. To solve this problem, we propose to change the values of the parameters of k-SPF. We show that this change of parameters effectively achieves appropriate traffic dispersion without making any bottleneck links. We also show that this change does not require many path candidates to be used in k-SPF, so k-SPF processing time becomes drastically shorter.	approximation algorithm;bottleneck (engineering);dijkstra's algorithm;end-to-end principle;genetic algorithm;heuristic;internet protocol suite;multipath propagation;path (graph theory);quality of service;router (computing);shortest path problem;yen's algorithm	Hiroshi Matsuura	2011	2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium	10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077016	private network-to-network interface;algorithm design;routing;quality of service;constrained shortest path first;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;sensor;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;distributed computing;approximation algorithm;k shortest path routing;bandwidth;computer network	Networks	-5.257216308201917	82.93064152952718	141008

In the absence of appropriate mechanisms, a system can enter and persist in a state of livelock during the overload period. This paper presents an evaluation of two mechanisms for livelock control experienced in computers of different capacities in a gigabit network. The first mechanism is called interrupt moderation and is implemented in most of today's high-performance network interfaces. The second mechanism, called NAPI, is a new API for Linux network drivers, which implements a set of strategies to handle packet overload and avoid its consequences. We show that NAPI is more efficient than interrupt moderation in many aspects, including system stability in the case of huge traffic and high CPU usage.	application programming interface;central processing unit;computer;deadlock;gigabit;interrupt coalescing;linux;network packet;non-functional requirement;protection mechanism;quality of service;resource exhaustion attack;response time (technology);tail call;throughput	Cristina D.

Although complete ILP formulations for optimal design of WDM networks have been proposed in literature, the computational cost of actually solving such formulations make this approach impractical, even for moderate sized networks. This high computational cost arises mainly due to the large number of integer variables in the formulations, which increases the complexity exponentially. As a result, most practical solutions use heuristics, which do not provide any guarantees on the performance. In this article, we propose two novel ILP formulations, which drastically reduce the number of integer variables compared to existing ILPs. This leads to much more efficient formulations. We also present a simple heuristic that may be used for larger networks for which ILP formulations become computationally intractable.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;computational complexity theory;heuristic (computer science);optimal design;path protection;wavelength-division multiplexing	Yash P.

e48e4fc68ddbda3f57c4ef146ab0fafc06fcc78c	re-optimizing the embedding of virtual infrastructures		Today, in the cloud computing context, the network is starting to arise as a true resource itself and not just as a required connectivity add-on. The ability to define network resources (e.g. routing/switching elements, bandwidth) in this context is still scarce, but there are clear evidences that this is a future reality. In this article, we consider that cloud infrastructure services will allow the definition of complete infrastructures, to which we refer as Virtual Infrastructures (VIs). These VIs comprise computing, storage and network resources. This article specifically tackles the VI embedding problem, which is known to be NP-hard. Having in mind this fact, different embedding strategies based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation are presented. The problem is addressed by proposing strategies that target load balancing and energy consumption of physical resources along with re-optimization strategies. A thorough evaluation of the different strategies is performed, studying the VI acceptance ratio, physical infrastructure energy consumption, and the impact of reconfigurations. Results show that there is a clear tradeoff between improving the VI acceptance ratio and reducing the physical infrastructure usage without allowing re-optimizations. We study in-depth different ways of combined strategies.	add-ons for firefox;bandwidth (signal processing);cloud computing;integer programming;linear programming;load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;np-hardness;routing	JoÃ£o Soares;Susana Sargento	2017	2017 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2017.8024597	distributed computing;computer network;computer science;energy consumption;cloud computing;resource (disambiguation);embedding;server;integer programming;load balancing (computing)	HPC	-10.97880009922533	82.10675222401503	141817

To avoid such problems while working to minimize budgetary expenses, we balanced traffic flow on âto-be-determinedâ backhauls and adjacent links, a mixed nonlinearand integer-programming problem that minimizes the aggregated flow subject to budget, backhaul assignment, top-level load-balanced routing, and link capacity constraints. Two algorithms are proposed, weighted backhaul assignment (WBA) and greedy load-balanced routing (GLBR), that operate in conjunction with Lagrangean relaxation (LR), used for constructing LR-based heuristics and also as a means of quantification and evaluation of the proposed algorithms. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithms achieve near-optimization, outperforming related solutions.

One of the main challenges to network discovery and selection is the heterogeneity of the coexisting networks in such networking environments. A key to solving this problem lies in flexible and effective interactions among the heterogeneous networks, the network control plane, and various user equipments. The Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is gaining high attention and acceptance in IT industry due to its power for coordinating heterogeneous systems for supporting various application requirements. The SOA offers a promising solution to network discovery and selection. In this paper, we investigate applying the SOA principles in wireless networking environments and propose a service-oriented architecture for network discovery and selection.

adcfcade53dc0ce2848acff75fa6e39431143157	enhancing security, scalability and flexibility of virtual private lan services		Ethernet based VPLS (Virtual Private LAN Service) networks are now becoming attractive in many enterprise applications due to simple, protocol-independent and cost efficient operation. However, new VPLS applications demand additional requirements, such as elevated security, enhanced scalability and improved flexibility. This paper summarized the results of a thesis which focused to increase the scalability, flexibility and compatibility of secure VPLS networks. First, we propose a scalable secure flat-VPLS architecture based on Host Identity Protocol (HIP) to increase the forwarding and security plane scalability. Then, a secure hierarchical-VPLS architecture has been proposed by extending the previous proposal to achieve control plane scalability as well. To solve the compatibility issues of Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) in VPLS networks, a novel Distributed STP (DSTP) is proposed. Lastly, we propose a novel SDN (Software Defined Networking) based VPLS (SoftVPLS) architecture to overcome tunnel management limitations in legacy secure VPLS architectures. Simulation models and testbed implementations are used to verify the performance of proposed solutions.	control plane;cost efficiency;enterprise software;host identity protocol;requirement;scalability;simulation;software-defined networking;spanning tree protocol;testbed;virtual private lan service	Madhusanka Liyanage;Mika Ylianttila;Andrei V.

However, Internet mobile streaming services are challenged by the inherently limited on-device resources, device heterogeneity, and the bulk amount of streaming data.  In this paper, focusing on resource utilization and streaming quality on mobile devices, we investigate 10 deployed Internet mobile streaming services that employ client-server, client-proxy-server, and P2P architectures from a client's perspective. We find that (1) existing Internet mobile streaming services mainly use the client-server architecture and commonly adopt burst traffic delivery that can save battery power consumption on mobile devices; (2) to deal with device heterogeneity, some streaming services have already utilized intermediate nodes (often the user's home computer) for online transcoding with a client-proxy-server architecture, but currently they lack power-friendly design for mobile devices; (3) a mobile device in P2P streaming consumes significantly more battery power mainly due to the inevitable P2P control traffic and uploading traffic to other peers. These findings provide us new insights to further optimize Internet mobile streaming in the future.	clientâserver model;internet;mobile device;peer-to-peer;proxy server;server (computing);stream (computing);upload	Yao Liu;Fei Li;Lei Guo;Songqing Chen	2011		10.1145/1989240.1989250	mobile search;mobile qos;mobile web;imt advanced;public land mobile network;mobile database;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;internet privacy;mobile station;mobile computing;world wide web;clientâserver model;computer network;mobile payment	Mobile	-18.72202076188991	75.209653667089	142285
06952e154da7f5b46f2fd23a2ed4878653b73c97	zone-based cooperative content caching and delivery for radio access network with mobile edge computing		Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising solution to meet the latency requirement for delay-sensitive services in a 5G radio access network (RAN). Its key idea is to deploy computing and storage capacities at the edge of the RAN to quickly provision content and processing capacities as required by the users. Efficient content caching and delivery are key issues to ensure the success of this technique. This paper proposes a zone-based cooperative content caching and delivery scheme for a RAN supporting MEC (MEC-RAN), where the RAN is modelled as a zone and is further sub-divided into multiple sub-zones. Content items are cooperatively cached and delivered among multiple sub-zones. The caching problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model. We also develop a heuristic cooperative content caching strategy to decide the content items to be cached in each MEC server. This novel strategy divides the storage space in each MEC server into two parts. The first part caches locally popular contents and the second part is used to cooperatively cache zone-wide popular items. We study the proposed scheme both through simulations and implementation on a testbed that consists of a subnetwork on our campus and commercial cloud service from Ali-Cloud. Both of these show that the proposed zone-based scheme performs better than other typical caching strategies in terms of average content delivery latency and balanced loading of the MEC servers.

We name this problem as Connectivity-aware Virtual Network Embedding (CoViNE). Solving CoViNE will enable a VN operator to perform failure recovery without depending on the SN provider, similar to the IP restoration mechanisms in IP-over-WDM networks. There are two steps in solving CoViNE: i) finding the virtual links that should be embedded disjointly, and ii) finding a substrate resource efficient embedding that ensures the virtual link disjointness constraint. We present two solutions to the CoViNE problem. The first solution uses a heuristic to compute the disjointness constraint, while an optimization model is used for VN embedding. The second solution, in contrast, uses heuristic for both the steps, and thus can solve larger instances of the problem. We compare our solutions with a cut set based approach that ensures VN connectivity for a single substrate link failure. Evaluation results show that our heuristics allocate ~15% extra resources on average compared to the cut set based optimal solution, and executes two to three orders of magnitude faster on the same problem instances.	algorithm;circuit restoration;computation;computational complexity theory;cut (graph theory);embedded system;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;nv network;priority queue;run time (program lifecycle phase);service-level agreement;throughput;virtual private network;wavelength-division multiplexing	Nashid Shahriar;Reaz Ahmed;Shihabur Rahman Chowdhury;Md Mashrur Alam Khan;Raouf Boutaba;Jeebak Mitra;Feng Zeng	2016	2016 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking) and Workshops	10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2016.7497249	theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-6.414409403794022	82.30345509374789	142567

Its links comprise 12 x 10-Gb/s synchronized parallel optical lanes. Ethernet data frames are transmitted by coarse wavelength division multiplexing link and bundled optical fibers. Ten of the lanes convey 640-bit data synchronously (64 bits x 10 lanes). One conveys forward error correction code ((132b, 140b) Hamming code), providing highly reliable (BER < 10 -12 ) data transmission, and the other conveys parity data, enabling faultlane recovery. A newly developed 64B/66B code-sequence-based deskewing mechanism is used that provides low-latency compensation for the lane-to-lane skew, which is less than 88 ns. Testing of this physical-layer architecture in a field programmable gate array circuit demonstrated that it can provide 100-Gb/s data communication with a 590k gate circuit, which is small enough for implementation in a single LSI circuit.

The solutions to these problems are required in real time as the demand fluctuates rapidly. The capacity allocation problem makes a large-scale integer programming problem too complex for practical applications. Using the Lagrangian relaxation technique and a suitably developed heuristic for multiplier adjustment, the computational complexity is reduced to such a degree that a real-time implementation of the algorithm is feasible. This article also develops efficient heuristics to aggregate demand. The proposed algorithm produces a near-optimal solution in pseudo-polynomial time.	aggregate data;algorithm;computational complexity theory;flow network;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;polynomial;pseudo-polynomial time;real-time clock;time complexity	Farzad Safaei;Iradj Ouveysi	2006	Optimization Methods and Software	10.1080/10556780600627867	time complexity;mathematical optimization;flow network;lagrangian relaxation;mathematics;mathematical economics;computational complexity theory;aggregate demand	Embedded	-5.794764491948748	81.98427779047567	142654

However, MPLS must use path restoration schemes to guarantee the delivery of packets through a network. Considering that MPLS is a label switching technology, it uses a method for label distribution based on signaling protocols like LDP (Label Distribution Protocol) among others. In this paper we present the simulation of some LDP messages and assess the performance of three path restoration schemes (Haskin, Makam, and Simple Dynamic) in an MPLS network using OMNET++. The simulation results show that the Simple Dynamic scheme presents a reduced arrival time when sending a message from the source to a destination, when compared to those times obtained to Haskin and Makam schemes.	circuit restoration;constraint-based routing label distribution protocol;end-to-end encryption;multiprotocol label switching;network packet;performance evaluation;quality of service;signaling protocol;simulation;time of arrival;virtual private network	Marcelino Minero-MuÃ±oz;Vicente AlarcÃ³n Aquino;Jose Galdino GarcÃ­a-Fierro;Roberto Rosas-Romero;Jorge RodrÃ­guez-Asomoza;Oleg Starostenko	2008		10.1007/978-90-481-3662-9_74	internet protocol;private network-to-network interface;wireless routing protocol;multiprotocol label switching;label distribution protocol;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;user datagram protocol;quality of service;private ip;zone routing protocol;internet layer;telecommunications;resource reservation protocol;internet protocol control protocol;computer science;internet protocol suite;ip tunnel;path vector protocol;computer security;virtual router redundancy protocol;computer network;open shortest path first;internetwork protocol	Networks	-9.05924132939774	88.04550935246557	142692

In this paper, we propose a graph abstraction based virtual network management framework that covers from tenant requirement specification to virtual network embedding on physical resources. The fundamental idea is to automatically create and manage virtual networks on the top of SDN technologies from high level tenant requirements. We expect that the proposed framework can overcome the limitation of overlay based network virtualization technologies, and leverage the deployment of SDN technologies.	control plane;high-level programming language;network architecture;openflow;programming paradigm;requirement;software deployment;software-defined networking	Yoonseon Han;Jonghwan Hyun;James Won-Ki Hong	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2016.7562203	full virtualization;real-time computing;virtualization;intelligent computer network;network architecture;network management station;computer science;virtual machine;network simulation;distributed computing;network management application;network processor;computer network	Networks	-15.67378970806418	84.57205163830832	142752

How to optimally cache layered videos based on caching price, the available capacity of cache nodes, and the social features of mobile users, however, is still a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a novel edge caching scheme to cache layered videos. First, a framework to cache layered videos is presented in which a cache node stores layered videos for multiple social groups, formed by mobile users based on their requests. Due to the limited capacity of the cache node, these social groups compete with each other for the number of layers they request to cache, aiming at maximizing their utilities while all mobile users in each group share the cost involved in the cache of video contents. Second, a Stackelberg game model is developed to study the interaction among multiple social groups and the cache node, and a noncooperative game model is introduced to analyze the competition among mobile users in different social groups. Third, leveraging the backward induction method, the optimal strategy of each player in the game model is proposed. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the exiting counterparts with a higher hit ratio and lower delay of delivering video contents.	backward induction;cpu cache;cache (computing);display resolution;edge computing;hit (internet);internet backbone;simulation;social network	Zhou Su;Qichao Xu;Fen Hou;Qing Yang;Qifan Qi	2017	IEEE Transactions on Multimedia	10.1109/TMM.2017.2733338	cache invalidation;mobile search;cache coloring;mobile service;computer science;cache;smart cache;computer network;mobile computing;cache algorithms	Mobile	-17.429216214878398	75.41862786722974	142893

To address the problem in full abstraction, we defined PDLz, an extension of the PDL event-condition-action language that supports the specification of firewall routing policies. PDLz allows the modelling of computer networks based on the concept of zone, i.e., a TCP/IP subnet where internal traffic remains unconstrained. PDLz policies are enforceable thanks to a direct translation to the IPtables firewall configuration language. At the same time, PDLz has a declarative semantics thanks to translation to logic programs. The logic programming translation also supports, by adding extra rules, the formal verification of properties of the network, viz. off-line reachability testing across firewalls. We describe the application of PDLz to the case studies.	action language;complex network;denotational semantics;event condition action;firewall (computing);formal verification;internet protocol suite;logic programming;online and offline;perl data language (pdl);reachability;router (computing);routing;subnetwork;viz: the computer game;iptables	Jorge Lobo;Massimo Marchi;Alessandro Provetti	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks	10.1109/POLICY.2012.14	application firewall;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;stateful firewall	Arch	-16.90370002084431	83.51684740751757	143102
63f14c79d235b3263c505b6aeeaa194d09c14d3d	survivable network design and optimization with network families		In modeling communication networks for simulation of survivability schemes, one goal is often to implement these schemes across varying degrees of nodal connectivity to get unbiased performance results. Abstractions of real networks, simple random networks, and families of networks are the most common categories of these sample networks. This paper looks at how using the network family concept provides a solid unbiased foundation to compare different network protection models. The network family provides an advantage over random networks by requiring one solution per average nodal degree, as opposed to having to solve many, which could take a significant amount of time. Also, because the network family looks at a protection scheme across a variety of average nodal connectivities, a clearer picture of the scheme&#x2019;s performance is gained compared to just running the simulation on a single network or select few networks.

TOMA is able to provide efficient resource utilization with less control overhead, especially for large-scale applications. It also alleviates the state scalability problem and simplifies multicast tree construction and maintenance when there are large numbers of groups in the networks.

deb1a7252d94ad8db652830b389be51f02569cc3	impact of ran virtualization on fronthaul latency budget: an experimental evaluation		In 3GPP the architecture of a New Radio Access Network (New RAN) has been defined where the evolved NodeB (eNB) functions can be split between a Distributed Unit (DU) and Central Unit (CU). Furthermore, in the virtual RAN (VRAN) approach, such functions can be virtualized (e.g., in simple terms, deployed in virtual machines). Based on the split type, different performance in terms of capacity and latency are requested to the network (i.e., fronthaul) connecting DU and CU. This study experimentally evaluates, in the 5G segment of the Advanced Research on NetwOrking (ARNO) testbed (ARNO-5G), the fronthaul latency requirements specified by Standard Developing Organizations (SDO) (3GPP in this specific case). Moreover it evaluates how much virtualization impacts the fronthaul latency budget for the the Option 7-1 functional split. The obtained results show that, in the considered Option 7-1 functional split, the fronthaul latency requirements are about 250 Î¼s but they depend on the radio channel bandwidth and the number of the connected UEs. Finally virtualization further decreases the latency budget.		F. Giannone;H. Gupta;D. Manicone;Koteswararao Kondepu;A.

Each router in CCN has a content store that caches objects according to a replacement algorithm and a pending interest table that stores pending requests waiting for matching objects. We propose a novel and flexible resource management system where the content store can store objects as well as pending requests. To each pending request, we add control fields that can be used to control caching resources according to a given objective function. We examine several applications that can benefit from using the proposed resource management system.

The FLCF utilizes one detecting controller to collect all the other controllers' failure notifications about a failed controller so as to help the detecting controller to make the final decision. Each controller pre-computes its recovery plan and synchronizes the plan with other controllers that will take over the switches if the controller is determined failed. Using Estinet, experiment results show that the proposed FLCF has better performance in terms of failover time and controller load standard deviation than related works.	disaster recovery plan;failover;network switch;reliability engineering;sensor;single point of failure	Ko-Chih Fang;Kuochen Wang;Jian-Hong Wang	2016	2016 10th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP)	10.1109/CSNDSP.2016.7573944	embedded system;real-time computing;genetic algorithm;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;software-defined networking;computer security;failover;computer network	Arch	-12.295450497811629	82.81842403314569	143464

The virtual infrastructures that enable IaaS support multitenancy by multiplexing the computational resources of data centers and result in substantial reductions in operational costs. Since hardware and software failures occur on a routine basis in large-scale systems, it is imperative for cloud providers to offer various failure recovery options for distributed services hosted on such infrastructures. In this article we present GENI-VIOLIN, a new cloud capability that can checkpoint a stateful distributed service while incurring very low overhead. The unique aspect of GENI-VIOLIN compared to previous work is that GENI-VIOLIN exploits programmable OpenFlow switches to provide checkpointing services in the network, thereby requiring minimal changes to the end host virtualization framework. We have developed a prototype of GENI-VIOLIN using the GENI infrastructure, and have demonstrated GENI-VIOLIN's checkpoint and restore capability across multiple GENI sites.	application checkpointing;cloud computing;computational resource;data center;hardware virtualization;imperative programming;megabit;multiplexing;multitenancy;network switch;networking hardware;openflow;overhead (computing);prototype;snapshot (computer storage);snapshot algorithm;state (computer science);transaction processing system;type of service;weatherstar;x86 virtualization	Ardalan Kangarlou;Dongyan Xu;Ulas C.

fc0d8f0663b909b48411e2860b59257fc2470150	optimal planning of virtual mobile networks		The explosive growth of smartphones and other portable devices, along with new traffic types generated by M2M applications, are creating huge volumes of mobile data traffic and signaling overhead, therefore requiring a radical change to the current mobile network architecture. This has promoted new virtualization paradigms, which combine diverse packet core services, and provide network functions implemented in software, rather than in dedicated hardware appliances, in order to scale capacity and introduce new services in a fast and cost-effective way. In this paper1 we study the optimization and resource allocation problems taking into account the deployment of virtualization structures. Our aim is to develop a theoretical framework of resource orchestration for mobile access networks, deriving the fundamental performance limits as well as the tradeoffs among the key system parameters. We therefore study optimal, time-varying placement and chaining of network functions. With respect to existing works, our optimization framework provides a much more precise system modeling, with, among others, a separation between control and data plane functions. We perform an extensive numerical analysis using both real traffic traces provided by a mobile operator (Vodafone UK) and real positions for radio access points for the UK area, and discuss the impact of network parameters on the system performance. Numerical results show that our proposed optimization framework permits to carefully model key aspects of network virtualization and service deployment/chaining in such scenarios, thus representing a very promising framework for the design of efficient and cost-effective mobile networks.	access network;forwarding plane;key;mathematical optimization;network architecture;network packet;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);personal digital assistant;smartphone;software deployment;systems modeling;tracing (software);traffic exchange;wireless access point	Jocelyne Elias;Fabio Martignon;Michele Mangili;Antonio Capone	2018	2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377004	architecture;real-time computing;virtualization;mobile broadband;network virtualization;software deployment;orchestration (computing);access network;computer science;cellular network	Mobile	-13.766269077130652	85.76807653069052	143663

Data traffics of these applications are difficult to fully comprehend at design time so as to optimize the network design. However, it has been discovered that the majority of dataflows in a network are dominated by less than 10% of the specific pathways. In this article, we introduce a method that is capable of identifying critical pathways in a network at runtime and can then dynamically reconfigure the network to optimize for network performance subject to the identified dominated flows. An online learning and analysis scheme is employed to quickly discover the emerging dominated traffic flows and provides a statistical traffic prediction using regression analysis. The architecture of a self-tuning network is also discussed which can be reconfigured by setting up the identified point-to-point paths for the dominance dataflows in large traffic volumes. The merits of this new approach are experimentally demonstrated using comprehensive NoC simulations. Compared to the conventional network architectures over a range of realistic applications, the proposed self-tuning network approach can effectively reduce the latency and power consumption by as much as 25% and 24%, respectively. We also evaluated the configuration time and additional hardware cost. This new approach demonstrates the capability of an adaptive NoC to handle more complex and dynamic applications.	dominance drawing;experiment;network on a chip;network performance;network planning and design;point-to-point protocol;run time (program lifecycle phase);self-tuning;simulation	Xiaohang Wang;Mei Yang;Yingtao Jiang;Peng Liu;Masoud Daneshtalab;Maurizio Palesi;Terrence S.

This paper aims to provide an overview of the most essential technologies utilized by this constantly evolving cloud ecosystem, identify the design principles of a media-aware cloud and present an architectural position based on the research conclusions. An end-to-end quality-aware optimization framework is evaluated, where path selection mechanisms are exploited in conjunction with media optimization in order to support cloud based multimedia delivery in a quality-aware manner. This position intends to be simplistic yet outright enough to be employed for mobile cloud deployment in the upcoming fifth generation network era.	compaq lte;ecosystem;electronic product code;end-to-end principle;entity;fifth generation computer;hardware virtualization;mathematical optimization;mobile cloud computing;modulation;network switch;over-the-top content;peak signal-to-noise ratio;real-time clock;scalability;software deployment;software-defined networking;testbed;video	Ilias Politis;Christos Tselios;Asimakis Lykourgiotis;Stavros A.

However, it is not easy to realize the load balancing globally in traditional networks as the whole status of the network is difficult to obtain. To address this problem, we propose the Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation Mechanism (FSEM), a path load balancing solution based on Software Defined Networking (SDN). In this mechanism, the network traffic is allocated to the paths operated by Open Flow switches, where the flow-handling rules are installed by the central SDN controller. The paths can be dynamically adjusted with the aid of FSEM according to the global view of the network. Experimental results verify that the proposed solution can effectively balance the traffic and avoid unexpected breakdown caused by link failure. The overall network performance is also improved as well.	algorithm;experiment;load balancing (computing);multipath propagation;network performance;network switch;network traffic control;routing;simulation;software-defined networking;synthetic intelligence;transmitter	Jun Li;Xiangqing Chang;Yongmao Ren;Zexin Zhang;Guodong Wang	2014	2014 IEEE 13th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2014.67	network load balancing;round-robin dns;network load balancing services;real-time computing;computer science;load balancing;channel bonding;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-11.598116583800964	82.91982461432471	143843

In this article, we study the potential of peer-assisted video delivery in WiFi mobile networks aimed at reducing serversÂ¿ load. Our study is based on a real measurement of mobile video viewing logs from a leading Internet video provider for 14 days. We analyze viewing behavior of users with respect to three main factors for the design of peer-assisted delivery network: viewing time, user population, and user locality. We then discuss the implications of the observations. Finally, we apply the findings on a BitTorrent-like VoD system and perform experiments with the collected viewing logs to demonstrate the benefits of peer-assisted video delivery. The peer assistance can reduce the serversÂ¿ load by as much as 50 percent for popular videos on average.	bittorrent;experiment;locality of reference;mobile device	Jiali Lin;Zhenyu Li;Gaogang Xie;Yi Sun;KavÃ© Salamatian;Wenjie Wang	2013	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2013.6658663	mobile search;the internet;mobile web;mobile telephony;imt advanced;mobile database;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;multimedia;internet privacy;mobile station;mobile collaboration;mobile computing;mobile communications over ip;computer network	Metrics	-18.254583768579547	75.76525358911968	143971
507b5fe36714eb6aa8acd96d1eef14212eddb82b	vericon: towards verifying controller programs in software-defined networks	hoare style verification;software defined networks	"""Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new paradigm for operating and managing computer networks. SDN enables logically-centralized control over network devices through a """"controller"""" software that operates independently from the network hardware, and can be viewed as the network operating system. Network operators can run both inhouse and third-party SDN programs (often called applications) on top of the controller, e.g., to specify routing and access control policies. SDN opens up the possibility of applying formal methods to prove the correctness of computer networks. Indeed, recently much effort has been invested in applying finite state model checking to check that SDN programs behave correctly. However, in general, scaling these methods to large networks is challenging and, moreover, they cannot guarantee the absence of errors.  We present VeriCon, the first system for verifying that an SDN program is correct on all admissible topologies and for all possible (infinite) sequences of network events. VeriCon either confirms the correctness of the controller program on all admissible network topologies or outputs a concrete counterexample. VeriCon uses first-order logic to specify admissible network topologies and desired network-wide invariants, and then implements classical Floyd-Hoare-Dijkstra deductive verification using Z3. Our preliminary experience indicates that VeriCon is able to rapidly verify correctness, or identify bugs, for a large repertoire of simple core SDN programs. VeriCon is compositional, in the sense that it verifies the correctness of execution of any single network event w.r.t. the specified invariant, and can thus scale to handle large programs. To relieve the burden of specifying inductive invariants from the programmer, VeriCon includes a separate procedure for inferring invariants, which is shown to be effective on simple controller programs. We view VeriCon as a first step en route to practical mechanisms for verifying network-wide invariants of SDN programs."""	access control;centralized computing;correctness (computer science);event-driven programming;first-order logic;first-order predicate;formal methods;hoare logic;image scaling;imperative programming;invariant (computer science);model checking;network operating system;network topology;networking hardware;programmer;programming paradigm;routing;software bug;software-defined networking;verification and validation;weak formulation;z3 (computer)	Thomas Ball;Nikolaj BjÃ¸rner;Aaron Gember;Shachar Itzhaky;Aleksandr Karbyshev;Shmuel Sagiv;Michael Schapira;Asaf Valadarsky	2014		10.1145/2594291.2594317	real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;software-defined networking;programming language	PL	-16.456846500933583	81.98136371587032	144271

In this paper, we examine datasets from two sources: Route Views and RIPE. We show that each dataset may have a geographical bias and, consequently, consist of distinct routes. Furthermore, by employing normalized Laplacian analysis, we identify distinct cluster characteristics that could not be inferred by directly examining the collected data.	exponent bias;internet topology;route views;routing	Johnson Chen;Ljiljana Trajkovic	2004	2004 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

Innovations in optical technology enable an optimal network design to switch traffic flows in available resources at minimum cost per bit. Network management plays a key role in controlling the flexible assignment of network resources to meet traffic demands by mastering the application of optical innovations, from more scalable and agile photonic technologies to architectural solutions for the integrated control of an optical network organized on multiple layers. This paper analyzes the guidelines for an operational model for a multi-layer optical control plane, coordinated with network management applications, to efficiently cover the engineering of traffic flows, the electrical/optical restoration and protection schema, and the strategy to monitor the multi-layer network for service assurance and integrity purposes. The analysis of multi-layer integration, providing vertical scalability in terms of capability to increase network connectivity capacity, is extended to path computation elements, the network management tool enabling horizontal scalability, splitting the load of computing connectivity routes across multiple entities.	agile software development;bus mastering;centralized computing;circuit restoration;computation;control plane;esp game;ecosystem;electronic engineering;entity;generalized multi-protocol label switching;goto;information model;internet backbone;jack edmonds;layer (electronics);navierâstokes equations;network packet;network planning and design;new product development;routing;scalability;service assurance;solution architect;transport layer security	Paolo Fogliata;Ermanno Belloli;Pietro V.

As a matter of fact, they are considered a key concept both for future Internet and information and communications technology. It is expected that a wide range of services will be made available for residential users (e.g. intelligent transportation systems, e-government, e-banking, e-commerce and smart management of energy demand), public administration entities, public safety and civil protection agencies and so on with increased quality, lower costs and reduced environmental impact. In order to achieve these ambitious objectives, new technologies should be developed such as non-invasive sensing, highly parallel processing, smart grids and mobile broadband communications. This paper considers the communication aspects of Smart City applications, specifically, the role of the latest developments of Long-Term Evolution-Advanced standard, which forecast the increase of broadband coverage by means of small cells. We shall demonstrate that the novel concept of small cell fully meets the emerging communication and networking requirements of future Smart Cities. To this aim, a feasible network architecture for future Smart Cities, based on small cells, will be discussed in the framework of a future smarter and user-centric perspective of forthcoming 4G mobile technologies.

c1b44ec3f03e0155ca71be4e85932aa5fefbbb6f	a robust optimization based energy-aware virtual network function placement proposal for small cell 5g networks with mobile edge computing capabilities		In the context of cloud-enabled 5G radio access networks with network function virtualization capabilities, we focus on the virtual network function placement problem for a multitenant cluster of small cells that provide mobile edge computing services. Under an emerging distributed network architecture and hardware infrastructure, we employ cloud-enabled small cells that integrate microservers for virtualization execution, equipped with additional hardware appliances. We develop an energy-aware placement solution using a robust optimization approach based on service demand uncertainty in order to minimize the power consumption in the system constrained by network service latency requirements and infrastructure terms. Then, we discuss the results of the proposed placement mechanism in 5G scenarios that combine several service flavours and robust protection values. Once the impact of the service flavour and robust protection on the global power consumption of the system is analyzed, numerical results indicate that our proposal succeeds in efficiently placing the virtual network functions that compose the network services in the available hardware infrastructure while fulfilling service constraints.

Additionally, mobile devices consume a significant chunk of content, which poses a unique challenge for provisioning efficient content delivery and is not addressed in contemporary infrastructures. In this paper, we present a naming system that provides Internet-scale content distribution service with a particular emphasis on content delivery across mobile devices. The basis of the system is a highly flexible and expressive content naming scheme. It is flexible in expressing diverse application requirements. To achieve fast name resolution, we design a two-level indexing network using Distributed Hash Table (DHT). This architecture is open and scalable. It utilizes a key-value storage system built on DHT. Our content delivery protocol relies on content routers to balance the load of delivering content and to throttle denial-of-service attacks. The feasibility of the system is analyzed based on a realistic modeling of the Internet. Simulation studies are performed to verify its usefulness and performance.	attributeâvalue pair;chunking (computing);computer data storage;content delivery network;denial-of-service attack;digital distribution;distributed hash table;future internet;internet;load (computing);mobile device;provisioning;requirement;router (computing);scalability;simulation;utility	Yaxiong Zhao;Jie Wu;Cong Liu;Mingming Lu	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6555348	communications protocol;the internet;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;world wide web;computer network	Networks	-15.42100804966001	75.93162857880587	144998

Route aggregation is the method of summarizing two or more routes to the corresponding destination IP subnetwork addresses into one common IP prefix address. Thus, it enables non-hierarchical network scalability by keeping the volume of routing and forwarding information within a reasonable size. Nevertheless, under certain circumstances route aggregation can cause network anomalies, e.g., routing and forwarding loops, which can seriously impact the performance and failure safety of the whole computer network. We describe an approach based on well-known Routing Information Protocol (RIPv2) that allows for the automation of route aggregation without manual intervention and still ensures loop-free forwarding paths and, therefore, short convergence times.	aggregate data;algorithm;border gateway protocol;classless inter-domain routing;cycle detection;distance-vector routing protocol;moving target indication;network topology;routing table;scalability;simulation;software suite;subnetwork;supernetwork;tree network	Frank Bohdanowicz;Christian Henke	2014	2014 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2014.6912454	policy-based routing;routing table;route;virtual routing and forwarding;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;loose source routing;static routing;real-time computing;supernetwork;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ip forwarding;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Networks	-8.174035063312235	80.0028119821406	145109

This model evaluates and analyzes the behavior of IP network, cache, RAID and disks under multiple synchronous I/O workloads by using closed queueing networks. The theoretical results are compared with the results from a real IP-based SAN using a variety of synthetic workloads. These experiments prove that the component-based method is an appropriate way to build performance model for a complex storage system. Using the model, we can find out that the bottleneck of SAN performance is network or storage node under different workloads or applications. We also identify areas for future research in the performance analysis of real IP-based SAN.

This paper describes a transport protocol for data transfer across dedicated end-to-end circuits. We call this protocol Circuit-TCP (C-TCP). The key feature of C-TCP is to maintain a fixed sending rate, as closely matched to the circuit rate as possible, with the aim of achieving high circuit utilization. C-TCP is implemented by modifying TCP code in Linux. Experiments on a wide-area experimental circuit-switched testbed show that C-TCP is able to fully utilize circuit bandwidth and sustain a high circuit utilization. The challenge in this work lay in matching the variability inherent in general-purpose end hosts with the monotonic nature of circuits.	circuit switching;connection-oriented communication;end-to-end principle;general-purpose markup language;linux;spatial variability;testbed	Anant P.

172e517a173f29994298fe75f4db8a173b754e49	task scheduling for edge computing with agile vnfs on-demand service model toward 5g and beyond		The demand for satisfying service requests, effectively allocating computing resources, and providing service on-demand application continuously increases along with the rapid development of the Internet. Edge computing is used to satisfy the low latency, network connection, and local data processing requirements and to alleviate the workload in the cloud.This paper proposes a gateway-based edge computing service model to reduce the latency of data transmission and the network bandwidth from and to the cloud. An on-demand computing resource allocation can be achieved by adjusting the task schedule of the edge gateway via the lightweight virtualization technology, Docker.The edge gateway can also process the service requests in the local network. The proposed edge computing servicemodel not only eliminates the computation burden of the traditional cloud servicemodel but also improves the operation efficiency of the edge computing nodes. This model can also be used for various innovation applications in the cloud-edge computing environment for 5G and beyond.

In order to matching P2P logical overlay network with physical topology, the position-based topology has been proposed. The proposed topology not only focuses on non-functional characteristics such as scalability, reliability, fault-tolerance, selforganization, decentralization and fairness, but also functional characteristics are addressed as well. The experimental results show that the hybrid complex topology achieves better characteristics than other complex networksâ models like small-world and scale-free models; since most of the real-life networks are both scale-free and small-world networks, it may perform well in mimicking the reality. Meanwhile, it reveals that the authors improve average distance, diameter and clustering coefficient versus Chord and CAN topologies. Finally, the authors show that the proposed topology is the most robust model, against failures and attacks for nodes and edges, versus small-world and scale-free networks.	clustering coefficient;complex network;fairness measure;fault tolerance;network theory;overlay network;peer-to-peer;real life;reliability engineering;scalability;streaming media	Venus Marza;Mehdi Dehghan;Behzad Akbari	2015	J.

2908186890350949d85a4f5f032c6709613bbf7a	named data networking with programmable switches		The Internet today is mainly used for distributing content, in a fundamental departure from its original goal of enabling communication between endpoints. As a response to this change, Named Data Networking (NDN) is a new architecture rooted on the concept of naming data, in contrast to the original paradigm based on naming hosts. This radical architectural shift results in packet processing in NDN to differ substantially from IP. As a consequence, current network equipment cannot be seamlessly extended to offer NDN data-plane functions. To address this challenge, available NDN router solutions are usually software-based, and even the highly-optimised designs tailored to specific hardware platforms present limited performance, hindering adoption. In addition, these tailor-made solutions are hardly reusable in research and production networks. The emergence of programmable switching chips and of languages to program them, like P4, brings hope for the state of affairs to change. In this paper, we present the design of an NDN router written in P4. We improve over the state-of-the-art solution by extending the NDN functionality, and by addressing its scalability limitations. A preliminary evaluation of our open-source solution running on a software target demonstrates its feasibility.	algorithm;emergence;forwarding plane;internet;network packet;network switch;open-source software;programming paradigm;router (computing);scalability	Rui Miguel;Salvatore Signorello;Fernando M.

This problem is aggravated when virtual infrastructures are geographically distributed, for performance and redundancy reasons. Connectivity is also crucial to acquire and integrate virtual resources in remote cloud datacenters with on-site IT resources. In enterprise environments where connectivity requirements cannot be met by best effort networks like Internet, such distributed infrastructure needs to make use of VPN services for inter-domain connectivity, provided by service providers over their trusted networks. To establish this connectivity, information regarding the interconnection link, such as interfaces and underlying protocols need to be negotiated and agreed upon. Today there is a lack of a technology independent mechanism and interface to perform such negotiation. This is a hindrance to automation of on-demand connectivity. In this paper we present a protocol for dynamic negotiation of connectivity service between domains. We describe how it has been used for negotiations between OpenStack and OpenNebula cloud datacenters and MPLS-based WAN, for establishment of L2/L3 VPN services.	best-effort delivery;cloud computing;data center;experiment;file spanning;inter-domain;interconnection;multiprotocol label switching;open-source software;requirement;software as a service;testbed;virtual machine;virtual private network;visual instruction set	Hareesh Puthalath;JoÃ£o Soares;Azimeh Sefidcon;Bob Melander;Jorge Carapinha;MÃ¡rcio Melo	2012	2012 IEEE 1st International Conference on Cloud Networking (CLOUDNET)	10.1109/CloudNet.2012.6483666	cloud computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	HPC	-16.592830172968814	82.56651229727744	146319

When a mobile node moves from an infrastructure connection and connects multihop to an Internet gateway, the performance will degrade and it may not be able to send all of its traffic via a single gateway. This highlights the need of load-balancing between Internet gateways, especially since the behavior of users today involves a multitude of parallel activities generating multiple flows. This paper proposes a solution that enables distribution of individual traffic flows via different Internet gateways instead of using one single gateway. The proposal includes extensions to mobile IP in order to handle flow mobility bindings. The performance of the solution is verified by simulation studies.	hoc (programming language);internet;load balancing (computing);mobile ip;multihoming;simulation	Robert BrÃ¤nnstrÃ¶m;Christer Ãhlund;Arkady B.

Various work has been done on revealing the cause and location of BGP routing instability, and they are helpful for operators to recover their networks from routing disasters. However, current approaches have the """"magic numbers"""" problem in choosing the parameters, which prevents the accuracy in finding the correct location from rising above a certain level. In this paper, we present a statistical approach based on pattern matching to accurately identify familiar BGP routing instabilities and pinpoint their locations.

In such networks, a connection request encounters higher blocking probability than in circuit-switched networks because of the wavelength-continuity constraint. Much research has focused on the shortest-path routing and alternate shortest-path routing. We consider fixed-paths least-congestion (FPLC) routing in which the shortest path may not be preferred to use. We then extend the algorithm to develop a new routing method: dynamic routing using neighborhood information. It is shown by using both analysis and simulation methods that FPLC routing with the first-fit wavelength-assignment method performs much better than the alternate routing method in mesh-torus networks (regular topology) and in the NSFnet T1 backbone network (irregular topology). Routing using neighborhood information also achieves good performance when compared to alternate shortest-path routing.	algorithm;blocking (computing);circuit switching;erlang (unit);internet backbone;national science foundation network;network congestion;routing;scott continuity;shortest path problem;simulation	Arun K.

As for a given Cluster, Cloud, or Grid system, the network topology is fixed and static or dynamic routing protocols are preinstalled to direct the network traffic. Users cannot change them once the system is deployed. Hence, it is hard for application developers to identify the optimal network topology and routing algorithm for their applications with distinct communication patterns. In this study, we design a CCG virtual system (CCGVS), which first uses container-based virtualization to allow users to create a farm of lightweight virtual machines on a single host. Then, it uses software-defined networking (SDN) technique to control the network traffic among these virtual machines. Users can change the network topology and control the network traffic programmingly, thereby enabling application developers to evaluate their applications on the same system with different network topologies and routing algorithms. The preliminary experimental results through both synthetic big data programs and NPB benchmarks have shown that CCGVS can represent application performance variations caused by network topology and routing algorithm.	algorithm;big data;cloud computing;computer cluster;experiment;network topology;network traffic control;open-source software;routing;software-defined networking;synthetic intelligence;virtual machine	Yongen Yu;Wei Tang;Hongbo Zou;Liwei Liu	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)	10.1109/BigData.2014.7004413	policy-based routing;routing table;routing domain;routing;static routing;network traffic control;real-time computing;intelligent computer network;network architecture;hierarchical routing;non-broadcast multiple-access network;topology table;computer science;multipath routing;network simulation;distributed computing;routing protocol;network topology;computer network;logical topology	HPC	-13.033774249250179	81.02445555442895	146959

Forwarding elements make only simple forwarding decisions based on flow table entries populated by the controller. While OpenFlow does not specify how topology monitoring is performed, the centralized controller can use Link-Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) messages to discover link and node failures and trigger restoration actions. This monitoring and recovery model has serious scalability limitations because the controller has to be involved in the processing of all of the LLDP monitoring messages. For fast recovery, monitoring messages must be sent with millisecond interval over each link in the network. This poses a significant load on the controller. In this paper we propose to implement a monitoring function on OpenFlow switches, which can emit monitoring messages without posing a processing load on the controller. We describe how the OpenFlow 1.1 protocol should be extended to support the monitoring function. Our experimental results show that data plane fault recovery can be achieved in a scalable way within 50 milliseconds using this function.	centralized computing;experiment;forwarding plane;link layer discovery protocol;mpls-tp;multiprotocol label switching;network switch;object access method;open-source software;openflow;optical mesh network;population;scalability;software-defined networking	James Kempf;Elisa Bellagamba;AndrÃ¡s Kern;David Jocha;Attila TakÃ¡cs;Pontus SkÃ¶ldstrÃ¶m	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364688	multiprotocol label switching;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	-13.728934947697386	82.45112201774957	147029

This paper presents a novel technique for uncovering the origins of delay variations by measuring the overlap between delay distribution of probed routes, and how these are affected by route stability. Evaluation is performed using two large scale experiments from 2006 and 2009, each measuring between more than 100 broadly distributed vantage points. Our main finding is that in both years, about 70% of the measured source-destination pairs and roughly 95% of the academic pairs, have delay variations mostly within the routes, while only 1520% of the pairs and less than 5% of the academic pairs witness a clear difference between the delays of different routes.	delay-gradient congestion control;end-to-end principle;experiment;routing	Yaron Schwartz;Yuval Shavitt;Udi Weinsberg	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-12334-4_3	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-11.211985147289047	78.41958739729604	147131

The architecture is assessed whilst providing a range of diverse active services from well-known network services like NAT and firewalls to novel types of services such as Mobile IPv6 handoff optimisation. A particular challenge we consider is the transparent and concurrent introduction of new services by different end users and network administrators. Besides a qualitative evaluation of the LARA++ architecture, the paper provides a number of quantitative results that show the performance of LARA++ whilst providing the different services. The results indicate that LARA++ not only supports highly generic programmability by independent users, but also provides sufficient performance for todayâs edge networks.	firewall (computing);mathematical optimization;mobile ip;network address translation;real life;router (computing);while	Tim Chart;Stefan Schmid;Manolis Sifalakis;Andrew C.

In the context of telecommunications, voice communication quality is the most visible and important aspects to QoS, and the ability to monitor and design for this quality should be a top priority. Voice quality refers to the clearness of a speakerâs voice as perceived by a listener. Its measurement offers a means of adding the human enduserâs perspective to traditional ways of performing network management evaluation of voice telephony services. Traditionally, measurement of usersâ perception of voice quality has been performed by expensive and time-consuming subjective listening tests. Over the last decade, numerous attempts have been made to supplement subjective tests with objective measurements based on algorithms that can be computerised and automated. This paper examines some of the technicalities associated with voice quality measurement, and presents a review of current subjective and objective voice quality measurement methods and standards as applied to telecommunication systems and devices, with particular focus on recent and internationally standardised methods.

To deal with this issues we propose a wireless network infrastructure that is based on latest technologies of Massive MIMO systems. We further extend our infrastructure with many smart features, to be capable of coping with Cloud Computing, Smartphones, IoT and other intelligence-based services. The proposed infrastructure uses Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Virtual Antenna Arrays (VAA) and Joint Beamforming to afford flexibility. We further propose a Terminalcentric rather than a Cell-centric based Infrastructure, which optimize interference aware environment and lead to higher capacity and reliability. The new infrastructure includes multi-purpose nodes that run a Network Operating System (NOS). This node will afford a scalable and flexible cost effective and semi-distributed network resources. Other propositions that meet Power-Effective, Cost-Effective, and Scenery aware design are discussed.	beamforming;cell (microprocessor);city network;cloud computing;interference (communication);jean;multi-purpose viewer;multi-user mimo;network function virtualization;network operating system;optimizing compiler;scalability;semiconductor industry;smart city;smartphone;software-defined networking	Ahmad Abboud;Jean-Pierre Cances;Vahid Meghdadi;Ali H.

45f62a74c1198699ef3bac84e3b754fc1e9f7f1f	the cost-efficient deployment of replica servers in virtual content distribution networks for data fusion		Abstract Content distribution networks (CDNs) play an important role in distributing content between end users and servers because they can effectively reduce response delays and bandwidth consumption by deploying sets of servers close to end users for service provision. A remaining challenge to CDN deployment is how to efficiently place the replica servers while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS). As a newly emerging technology, network function virtualization (NFV) facilitates the use of network function software and enables the deployment of different network functions on networked commercial servers. Virtual CDNs are among the most relevant cases that could benefit from NFV. In this paper, we study the problem of efficiently deploying replica servers (middle boxes) in cloud data centers via NFV. We propose an approximation algorithm based on spectral clustering theory to solve the replica server placement problem within an NFV environment. We conduct simulations using local and large-scale data centers to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm.

7cba73dd1d35a4f334411e6e56bfef90941793c0	icn-based protocol architectures for next-generation backhauling over satellite		The increasing demand for mobile services has been calling for new anywhere-anytime communication paradigms, building on the integration of heterogeneous technologies, such as satellite, LTE, and the new generation of mobile networks, i.e., 5G. In particular, the network design philosophy has shifted towards a more content-oriented approach so as to more efficiently meet the users' demands in terms of fast content availability and service continuity. Following this line, this paper proposes an enhancement to the PURSUIT information centric network (ICN) architecture, so as to improve the quality of experience of users in highly mobile environments. Simulation campaigns show the performance gain offered by the proposed solution with respect to regular PURSUIT implementations and benchmark IP-based strategies.	anytime algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);benchmark (computing);compaq lte;icn gps;network planning and design;scott continuity;simulation	Tomaso de Cola;Andrea Blanco	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7996549	mobile search;real-time computing;computer network;architecture;network architecture;computer science;mobile telephony;quality of experience;backhaul (telecommunications);network planning and design;mobile computing	Robotics	-15.255624330457099	87.7326700548254	147968

They have recently absorbed a lot of attention from the Internet users and the research community. Regarding the difficulty and cost for a large scale living deployment, many proposed P2P protocols were evaluated by a simulator. However, most of current P2P simulators have common draw backs including the poor scalability with massive simulated peers and the lack of realistic underlay network layer support. Unfortunately, those functionalities are critical to understand how a P2P protocol would be-have in the real circumstance. In this paper, we pre-sent some approaches to overcome such defects, and the design considerations of HiFiP2P, our novel large-scale parallel Peer-to-Peer simulator with a measured realistic Internet data as its network layer support. Comparison experiments show that HiFiP2P simulator outperforms the existing simulation platform J-Sim & PlanetSim in both aspects of scalability and efficiency.	experiment;internet;peer-to-peer;planetsim;routing;scalability;simulation;software deployment	Guangyu Shi;Youshui Long;Hao Gong;Changqing Wan;Chuanliang Yu;Xianqing Yang;Hongli Zhang;Yunfei Zhang	2009	2009 17th Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-based Processing	10.1109/PDP.2009.17	communications protocol;synchronization;the internet;simulation;internet traffic;computer science;peer-to-peer;parallel;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-9.92663990469642	77.19257713678334	148046

Network sharing is desirable for operators to reduce the investment needed to deploy and operate PON networks. In this paper, we introduce a bandwidth resource sharing framework for XG-PONs among multiple operators. In this framework, each transmission convergence (TC) frame with fixed time slots (125us) is regarded as a bandwidth slice. We proposed two slice scheduling schemes for network infrastructure provider to assign slices to different operators. Our proposed scheme meets three key requirements of network virtualization: isolation, customization and efficient resource utilization. We analyze the details of this scheme and provide discrete event simulation results to support the analysis. Results show the efficacy in isolation and resource utilization and the flexibility of running different customized algorithms within slices on the same shared network equipment.	10g-pon;algorithm;passive optical network;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment;transmission (bittorrent client);yamaha xg	Chengjun Li;Wei Guo;Wei Wang;Weisheng Hu;Ming Xia	2017	2017 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2017.7876161	multi-frequency network;real-time computing;engineering;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-13.296558189691604	84.9573289656858	148084

However, such heterogeneity faces great challenges in correct, efficient and dynamic network policy implementation because, firstly, existing schemes are limited to exclusively physical or virtual NFBs and not a mix, and secondly, NFBs can co-exist at various locations in the network as a result of emerging technologies such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). In this paper, we propose a H eterogeneous netw O rk p O licy enfor C ement scheme (HOOC) to overcome these challenges. We first formulate and model HOOC, which is shown be to NP-Hard by reducing from the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP). We then propose an efficient online algorithm that can achieve optimal latency-wise NF service chaining amongst heterogenous NFBs. In addition, we also provide a greedy algorithm when operators prefer smaller run-time than optimality. Our simulation results show that HOOC is efficient and scalable whilst testbed implementation demonstrates that HOOC can be easily deployed in the data center environments. Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

78410760a22280ce6413fcc1cc32ed1501541ac6	end-user mapping: next generation request routing for content delivery		Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) deliver much of the worldu0027s web, video, and application content on the Internet today. A key component of a CDN is the mapping system that uses the DNS protocol to route each clientu0027s request to a ``proximalu0027u0027 server that serves the requested content. While traditional mapping systems identify a client using the IP of its name server, we describe our experience in building and rolling-out a novel system called end-user mapping that identifies the client directly by using a prefix of the clientu0027s IP address. Using measurements from Akamaiu0027s production network during the roll-out, we show that end-user mapping provides significant performance benefits for clients who use public resolvers, including an eight-fold decrease in mapping distance, a two-fold decrease in RTT and content download time, and a 30% improvement in the time-to-first byte. We also quantify the scaling challenges in implementing end-user mapping such as the 8-fold increase in DNS queries. Finally, we show that a CDN with a larger number of deployment locations is likely to benefit more from end-user mapping than a CDN with a smaller number of deployments.	routing	Fangfei Chen;Ramesh K.

The channel assignment problem has been also shown to be interdependent with the routing problem, i.e., the problem to determine the amount of traffic flow to be routed on every link. Such a relationship raises the need to recompute the channel assignment every time the traffic pattern changes. However, channel assignment algorithms designed to assign channels from scratch will likely return a completely different configuration of radios, which would disrupt the network operation for the time required to switch to using the links established on the new channels. As shown by the experiments that we conducted, such a time may not be negligible, due to the resistance of routing protocols designed for wireless ad hoc and mesh networks to rapidly flagging a link as established/lost. Such a consideration, along with the observation that channel assignment algorithms may be suboptimal, led us to the design of a channel reassignment algorithm that takes the current channel assignment into account and attempts to cope with the new traffic pattern in the best manner possible while modifying the channel on a limited number of radios. In this paper, we illustrate such a channel reassignment algorithm and evaluate its performance by means of both simulations and experiments with real hardware.	algorithm;assignment problem;computational complexity theory;experiment;hoc (programming language);interdependence;loss function;mesh networking;network performance;optimization problem;pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms;routing;simulation;testbed;throughput;wireless mesh network	Stefano Avallone;Giovanni Di Stasi;Andreas Kassler	2013	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2012.107	algorithm design;routing;throughput;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;distributed computing;interference;routing protocol;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless;computer network	Mobile	-4.714572115228293	82.7985634701452	148560
5890192c19d03b0be9b0dec76e20f75b3e722895	panorama: real-time bird's eye view of an openflow network		Software Defined Network (SDN) is an emerging networking paradigm that has gained enormous attention from the industries as well as the research community. SDN decouples data plane and control plane. The direct programmability of the control plane allows us to develop routing algorithms, which can accommodate versatile requirements of diverse network applications. On another side, Quality-of-Service provisioning, traffic engineering, etc., require accurate traffic measurements because an up-to-date view of the network facilitates service providers to optimize network performance. Existing approaches of traffic measurements demand either additional resources or alteration to infrastructure. In this paper, we present a collection of lightweight mechanisms for obtaining real-time network information in SDN environment. In particular, our mechanisms aim to obtain per-flow and per-port traffic statistics, topology information, data transfer rate for each network link, etc. Since our approach exploits the built-in capabilities of OpenFlow protocol, it does not require any changes to the infrastructure. We also implemented our proposed mechanisms and developed Panorama, a graphical user interface for real-time presentation of the obtained information.	algorithm;bird's-eye view;control plane;forwarding plane;graphical user interface;network congestion;network performance;openflow;programming paradigm;provisioning;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;requirement;routing;software-defined networking;traffic shaping;web traffic	Ankit Gangwal;Mauro Conti;Manoj Singh Gaur	2017	2017 IEEE 14th International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control (ICNSC)	10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000092	openflow;network topology;computer network;network monitoring;forwarding plane;network performance;software-defined networking;network traffic control;provisioning;computer science;distributed computing	Networks	-14.381153581040632	83.2422208944795	148813
b017d95c5c2dab01f316b4c2b64f2d6cb8d7f139	enabling high performance rack-scale optical switching through global synchronisation		There is a growing need for high radix switches in data centres and high performance computing. Current computing systems are interconnected using large numbers of relatively low radix (32--48 port) switches that restrict scalability and performance, while increasing cost and management complexity. In parallel, there is a growing interest in dense rack scale computing in which a single rack can contain several thousand network nodes. To meet these demands, we recently demonstrated a flexible optical switch architecture using fast tuneable lasers and coherent receivers which scales to over 1000 ports. However, using traditional clock data recovery circuits in this or any optical packet switch results in large latency and throughput penalties due to resynchronisation on each new connection. In this talk, we will address the challenges of building a fully synchronous optical switch network, of rack-scale or greater, in which a reference clock is distributed to every node to reduce resynchronisation overhead. We will firstly present results from preliminary FPGA-based experiments demonstrating the viability of synchronising a rack scale network. We will then discuss the limitations on port count, range and bit rate which would limit the ability to build larger synchronous systems in this way.	coherence (physics);data recovery;experiment;field-programmable gate array;network packet;network switch;optical switch;overhead (computing);packet switching;scalability;supercomputer;tcp global synchronization;throughput	Kari Clark;Phill Watt	2017		10.1145/3073763.3073773	architecture;real-time computing;latency (engineering);throughput;computer science;synchronization;scalability;node (networking);data recovery;optical switch	HPC	-10.921965636481968	84.14655883470638	148873

However there is lack of theoretical foundations and quantitative models to evaluate different design choices and compare their respective advantages. In this paper, we take an initial step to build a quantitative framework to enable characterization and comparison of two popular classes of ICN name-oriented routing and resolution techniques, flooding and distributed hash table (DHT). Our results indicate that the interaction of several factors such as network size, content location dynamics and content popularity contributes to the performance of the routing and resolution mechanisms. Especially we obtain a quantitative expression to determine under what conditions one approach yields superior performance over the other. It also suggests that a hybrid DHT-flooding mechanism may perform better although the actual design of such a hybrid protocol is out of the scope of this paper. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of variable-length names and obtain an expression for the optimal name length assigned to a content object. Finally, we present another application of our model, determining when the name aggregation in content location publishing can reduce control overhead and improve scalability. Our modeling and analysis results reveal valuable insights regarding design tradeoffs and provide design guidelines.	distributed hash table;future internet;icn gps;overhead (computing);routing;scalability;variable-length code	Dan Zhang;Hang Liu	2013	2013 22nd International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2013.6614186	policy-based routing;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;cryptography;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;operating system;distributed computing;routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;statistics;computer network	HPC	-14.118187733077372	76.39665782379748	149130

While the recent load-balanced switch architecture uses simple unicast switch fabric and does not require a central scheduler, it is only good at handling unicast traffic. In this paper, we extend an existing load-balanced switch called feedback-based two-stage switch to support multicast traffic. In particular, an efficient multicast scheduling algorithm (FTMS) is designed. With FTMS, head-of-line (HOL) packet blocking at each input port is eliminated by adopting âpointerâ queues. To cut down queuing delay, packet replication is carried out at middle-stage ports. As compared with other multicast scheduling algorithms, simulation results show that our FTMS always provides the highest throughput.	algorithm;blocking (computing);feedback;hol (proof assistant);load balancing (computing);multicast;network packet;network switch;pointer (computer programming);queuing delay;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;unicast	Chunzhi He;Bing Hu;Kwan Lawrence Yeung	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503499	real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Networks	-4.959907902729843	86.52595030024743	149326

It has significant impact on the well-being of the global Internet. Over the past ten years, there has been a large body of studies conducted on evaluating and improving the BGP performance. These studies develop tools using BGP data for identifying the Internet topology, AS relationships, and AS-level paths. More importantly BGP is the main data source for evaluating the Inter-domain routing performance and discovering routing anomalies such as prefix hijacking attacks. However, most of these studies focus on one or a few aspects of BGP in a short time period. Till today, the route monitoring system has been deployed for ten years and there has been a significant amount of criticisms on the bad performance of BGP. Our work is the first to critically examine and summarize BGP performance and its changes through time. We evaluate BGP from a diverse set of aspects ranging from routing diversity to convergence performance. We design a set of systematic statistical analysis to cope with the noise in data collection process. Due to the huge volume of data required for the analysis, we implement our evaluation system on top of the cloud computing platform from Amazon EC2. Our results provide a few insights on how to improve BGP and the Internet routing system in the future.	amazon elastic compute cloud (ec2);border gateway protocol;cloud computing;forwarding plane;image noise;inter-domain;internet topology;network packet;overhead (computing);routing;whole earth 'lectronic link	Mallik Tatipamula	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962883	route views;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;default-free zone;computer security;computer network;network mapping	Metrics	-11.63773796034041	78.32101982952962	149401

It is shown that the blocking probability of high data rate requests is usually higher than the blocking probability of other requests. A relevant strategy aimed at solving this problem is proposed, investigated, and compared with the known solution.

Space information networks are able to enhance detection and transmission capabilities compared to the current single Earth observation satellite. Although lots of technical work has been done concerning the space network architecture and protocols, the security issues have not been investigated well. In this article, we focus on the security problems in space information networks from four perspectives, that is, secure handoff, secure transmission control, key management, and secure routing. Existing works, together with their challenges and open problems, are discussed, and our proposed scheme is introduced. Overall, this article aims to help readers understand the motivation, problem formulation, and solutions regarding security issues on space information networks.	graph coloring;key management;network architecture;routing;secure transmission	Chunxiao Jiang;Xuexia Wang;Zhanquan Sun;Hsiao-Hwa Chen;Yong Ren	2015	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2015.7180512	telecommunications;space technology;network access control;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-11.381568096110907	86.8094849180089	149446

Multipath protocols, for example, use node-local and heuristic information to only exploit path diversity between shortest paths. In this paper, we use a measurement-based approach to schedule flows over both shortest and non-shortest paths based on temporal network-wide utilization. We present the Baatdaat flow scheduling algorithm which uses spare DC network capacity to mitigate the performance degradation of heavily utilized links. Results show that Baatdaat achieves close to optimal Traffic Engineering by reducing network-wide maximum link utilization by up to 18% over Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing, while at the same time improving flow completion time by 41% - 95%.	algorithm;centralized computing;data center;elegant degradation;equal-cost multi-path routing;hardware acceleration;heuristic;internet;multipath propagation;netfpga;network congestion;openflow;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);shortest path problem;simulation;testbed;throughput	Fung Po Tso;Gregg Hamilton;Rene Weber;Colin Perkins;Dimitrios P.

With the advent of cloud, grid, and cluster computing it has become feasible to use parallelization to perform richer larger-scale simulations. Moreover, the computing resources needed to perform statistically rigorous simulations are now easily obtainable. Although a number of parallel network simulation frameworks exists, the issue of statistical rigorous testing has largely not been addressed. This work presents a parallel MPI-aware network simulation framework that is specifically designed to provide automated support for statistically rigorous experimentation, thereby offloading this significant researcher burden. Unlike prior frameworks, the proposed framework includes a distribution-free statistical analysis feedback loop that automatically deduces the next set of experiments that need to be run. The value of this new framework is highlighted by exploring the well known issue of assessing the true duration of start-up transients within mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) simulations.	cloud computing;computer cluster;computer simulation;downstream (software development);ergodicity;experiment;feedback;hoc (programming language);message passing interface;parallel computing;stationary process;transient (computer programming);whole earth 'lectronic link	Eamon Millman;Deepali Arora;Stephen W.

00787a4ff1c2574bb24afa54b05441067ba43fa8	router position-based cooperative caching for video-on-demand in information-centric networking		Information centric networking (ICN) is one of the emerging Internet paradigms proposed to overcome the shortcoming of the current host-centric Internet. With ubiquitous in-network caching, ICN can facilitate content delivery and reduce network delay. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative caching scheme based on routers' position to cache popular videos on the edge routers which are closer to users. A priori knowledge of videos' popularity is not required as the proposed scheme adapts itself to the user requests. The benefits of our proposed approach are: light-weight, short content delivery time, and reduced network usages and publisher load. We use a simple topology to show how the proposed scheme works. Then, we use a realistic topology with real data traces to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms existing schemes in terms of average number of hops and reduced publisher load ratio for both scenarios.	cache (computing);digital distribution;icn gps;internet;router (computing);simulation;tracing (software)	Zhe Zhang;Chung-Horng Lung;Ioannis Lambadaris;Marc St-Hilaire;Sankarshan Sakkarepattana Nagaraja Rao	2017	2017 IEEE 41st Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	10.1109/COMPSAC.2017.203	computer science;cache;real-time computing;router;network delay;network topology;the internet;information-centric networking;popularity;computer network	Metrics	-15.541421251759756	75.7212984509377	149716

How to effectively support the popular browser-based web applications is a key to success for Named Data Networking (NDN). However, since NDN has a totally different running mechanism from the traditional IP network, the existing web browsers mainly designed for the HTTP protocol and the TCP/IP-based Internet rather than named data networking, cannot communicate with NDN routers directly and do not inherently support the NDN-based web applications. Instead of providing a browser add-on or HTTPâNDN proxy/gateway, we designed and developed a complete NDNBrowser based on open source WebKit to natively support NDN-based web applications in the web browser kernel. Some inherent NDN features are seamlessly integrated into the browser to support the direct interactions between web browser and NDN network. Considering backwards compatibility and smooth network evolution, the NDNBrowser enables content fetching and rendering by both âccnx:/â and âhttp:/â schemes URI in HTML, CSS and JavaScript simultaneously. Experimental results show that the NDNBrowser outperforms existing NDN.JS and HTTPâNDN proxy/gateway implementations by 19Ã and 5Ã respectively in terms of throughput. Finally, a real NDN-based web application is deployed on a NDN experimental network in our campus environment for network innovations to verify the practicability of NDNBrowser.

It leverages the validation of BGP prefix updates based on cryptographically verified data and may lead to secure inter-domain routing at last. In this talk, we present RTRlib, a highly efficient reference C implementation of the RPKI router part. We deploy RTRlib and conduct a long-term measurement using live BGP streams to evaluate the current impact of RPKI-based prefix origin validation on BGP routers. We observe that most of the invalid prefixes are most likely the result of misconfiguration. RTRlib is the only openly available tool for monitoring RPKI validation activities in real-time. We measure a relatively small overhead of origin validation on commodity hardware (5% more RAM than required for full BGP table support, 0.41% load in case of â¡ 92,000 prefix updates per minute).	border gateway protocol;commodity computing;inter-domain;internet backbone;overhead (computing);random-access memory;real-time clock;real-time recovery;resource public key infrastructure;router (computing);routing	Matthias WÃ¤hlisch;Fabian Holler;Thomas C.

76768a86b9901a87af79a5c60e08e7edcc2fe52c	network slicing games: enabling customization in multi-tenant mobile networks		Network slicing to enable resource sharing among multiple tenants ânetwork operators and/or servicesâ is considered a key functionality for next generation mobile networks. This paper provides an analysis of a well-known model for resource sharing, the âshare-constrained proportional allocationâ mechanism, to realize network slicing. This mechanism enables tenants to reap the performance benefits of sharing, while retaining the ability to customize their own usersâ allocation. This results in a network slicing game in which each tenant reacts to the user allocations of the other tenants so as to maximize its own utility. We show that, under appropriate conditions, the game associated with such strategic behavior converges to a Nash equilibrium. At the Nash equilibrium, a tenant always achieves the same, or better, performance than under a static partitioning of resources, hence providing the same level of protection as such static partitioning. We further analyze the efficiency and fairness of the resulting allocations, providing tight bounds for the price of anarchy and envy-freeness. Our analysis and extensive simulation results confirm that the mechanism provides a comprehensive practical solution to realize network slicing. Our theoretical results also fill a gap in the literature regarding the analysis of this resource allocation model under strategic players.	anarchy;fairness measure;multitenancy;nash equilibrium;next-generation network;simulation	Pablo Caballero Garces;Albert Banchs;Gustavo de Veciana;Xavier PÃ©rez Costa	2016	CoRR			AI	-12.990391708901821	85.18814062493534	150413

Given a static topology, the maintenance mechanism for node join/departure is critical to designing an efficient P2P network. Kautz graphs have many good properties such as constant degree, low congestion and optimal diameter. Due to the complexity in topology maintenance, however, to date there have been no effective P2P networks that are proposed based on Kautz graphs with base > 2. To address this problem, this paper presents the âdistributed Kautz (D-Kautz) graphsâ, which adapt Kautz graphs to the characteristics of P2P networks. Using the D-Kautz graphs we further propose SKY, the first effective P2P network based on Kautz graphs with arbitrary base. The effectiveness of SKY is demonstrated through analysis and simulations.	interconnection;network congestion;peer-to-peer;simulation	Yiming Zhang;Xicheng Lu;Dongsheng Li	2009	Science in China Series F: Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-009-0016-x	combinatorics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing	Metrics	-8.858839587247658	78.40074233520987	150415

Our technique allows us to design a new class of unlimited-state-per-node DHTs that is able to adapt naturally to a wide range of lookup workloads. EpiChord is able to achieve O(1)-hop lookup performance under lookup-intensive workloads and at least O(logn)-hop lookup performance under churn-intensive workloads even in the worst case (though it is expected to perform better on average). Our simulations show that our approach can reduce both lookup latencies and path lengths by a factor of 3 by issuing only 3 queries asynchronously in parallel per lookup. Furthermore, we show that we are able to achieve this result with minimal additional communication overhead and the number of messages generated per lookup is in general no more than that for the corresponding sequential chord lookup algorithm.	algorithm;automatic parallelization;best, worst and average case;distributed hash table;lookup table;overhead (computing);parallel computing;routing;simulation;state management	Ben Leong;Barbara Liskov;Erik D.

The goals of this work are to 1) create an overlay architecture which allows us to sample specific path quality metrics among different paths; 2) utilize the proposed overlay architecture in order to implement our proposed QoS-based routing schemes, Application Layer Switching (ALSW) and Application Layer Striping (ALST). Perhaps the most significant contribution of this research is that we are able to achieve better than best-effort QoS without modifying intermediate nodes (i.e., routers), thus encouraging immediate deployment. Additionally, this research is performed on an actual wide area network (WAN) testbed, comprised of universities across the nation. Also, we assemble this architecture as a peer-to-peer framework, encouraging collaborating individuals with average workstations to improve the QoS of their traffic.	best-effort delivery;data striping;extensibility;peer-to-peer;quality of service;routing;software deployment;testbed;workstation	Raheem A.

0a4495650f60f2c7df399dda4bd8042dd8422d4c	network optimization for high performance cloud computing		Once thought of as a technology restricted primarily to the scientific community, High-performance Computing (HPC) has now been established as an important value creation tool for the enterprises. Predominantly, the enterprise HPC is fueled by the needs for high-performance data analytics (HPDA) and large-scale machine learning â trades instrumental to business growth in todayâs competitive markets. Cloud computing, characterized by the paradigm of on-demand network access to computational resources, has great potential of bringing HPC capabilities to a broader audience. Clouds employing traditional lossy network technologies, however, at large, have not proved to be sufficient for HPC applications. Both the traditional HPC workloads and HPDA require high predictability, large bandwidths, and low latencies, features which combined are not readily available using best-effort cloud networks. On the other hand, lossless interconnection networks commonly deployed in HPC systems, lack the flexibility needed for dynamic cloud environments. In this thesis, we identify and address research challenges that hinder the realization of an efficient HPC cloud computing platform, utilizing the InfiniBand interconnect as a demonstration technology. In particular, we address challenges related to efficient routing, load-balancing, low-overhead virtualization, performance isolation, and fast network reconfiguration, all to improve the utilization and flexibility of the underlying interconnect of an HPC cloud. In addition, we provide a framework to realize a self-adaptive network architecture for HPC clouds, offering dynamic and autonomic adaptation of the underlying interconnect according to varying traffic patterns, resource availability, workload distribution, and also in accordance with service provider defined policies. The work presented in this thesis helps bridging the performance gap between the cloud and traditional HPC infrastructures; the thesis provides practical solutions to enable an efficient, flexible, multi-tenant HPC network suitable for high-performance cloud computing.	access network;autonomic computing;bandwidth (signal processing);best-effort delivery;bridging (networking);cloud computing;computation;computational resource;infiniband;interconnection;load balancing (computing);lossless compression;lossy compression;machine learning;multitenancy;network architecture;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;routing	Feroz Zahid	2017			cloud computing;distributed computing;computer science	HPC	-14.813817970646157	79.31483834400686	150903

This paper presents a decentralized, accurate, and low cost system that predicts pairwise bandwidth between hosts. We describe an algorithm to construct a distributed tree that embeds bandwidth measurements. The correctness of the algorithm is provable when driven by precise measurements. We then describe three novel heuristics that achieve high accuracy for predicting bandwidth even with imprecise input data. Simulation experiments with a real-world dataset confirm that our approach shows high accuracy with low cost.	approximation algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);correctness (computer science);desktop computer;end-to-end principle;experiment;heuristic (computer science);interconnection;internet;join (sql);peer-to-peer;provable security;scalability;search algorithm;simulation	Sukhyun Song;Peter J.

With the advent of larger and more complex Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs), it is becoming increasingly interesting to build those distributed network applications from the Internet for MANETs as well. Of course, it would be intuitive to also use structured peer-to-peer overlays in MANETs as a platform for such networks applications. Unfortunately, the conventional Internet-based structured peerto-peer overlays are not well-suited for the direct deployment on top of MANETs. This article analyzes the design requirements for structured peer-to-peer overlays that are to run on top of MANETs. It will further provide a case study of a structured peer-to-peer overlay explicitly designed for MANETs that enables the straight-forward porting of many of the above mentioned distributed network application for the use in MANETs. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In recent times, Ethernet has entered new networking areas, such as Metro Area Network (MAN) and Industrial Area Network (IAN), where specialized protocols dominate the market. In addition to the well known advantages, Ethernet acts as the common platform to integrate multiple protocols. However, Ethernet falls short of the stringent resilience requirements mandated by applications in MEN and IAN, despite progress made by the community on additional standardization. We describe a new approach for swift failure detection and recovery in Ethernet ring topologies called Rapid Ring Recovery (RRR). RRR is based on the novel usage of multiple virtual rings.

Congestion control is the core networking task of modulating traffic sourcesâ data-transmission rates so as to efficiently utilize network capacity. Congestion control is fundamental to computer networking research and practice, and has recently been the subject of extensive attention in light of the advent of Internet services such as live video, augmented and virtual reality, Internet-of-Things, and more. We build on the recently introduced Performance-oriented Congestion Control (PCC) framework to formulate congestion control protocol design as an RL task. Our RL framework opens up opportunities for network practitioners, and even Internet application developers, to train congestion control models that fit their local performance objectives based on small, bootstrapped models, or complex, custom models, as their resources and requirements merit. We present and discuss the challenges that must be overcome so as to realize our long-term vision for Internet congestion control.	application domain;communications protocol;multiflow;network congestion;partial template specialization;portable c compiler;reinforcement learning;requirement;rich internet application;virtual reality;web service	Nathan Jay;Maximilian Gaedtke;Brighten Godfrey;Michael Schapira;Aviv Tamar	2018	CoRR		computer network;application domain;the internet;reinforcement learning;network congestion;bootstrapping;virtual reality;resource (disambiguation);computer science	Networks	-14.839073312586226	84.56573340962694	151412

Several metrics are compared which are applicable to these projects, including relative delay penalty, normalized resource usage and stress. We evaluate those projects in a uniform network environment and discuss how the design approach and structure affects the performance.	multicast;one-to-many (data model);one-to-one (data model);overlay network;programming paradigm;unicast	Yan Zhu;Min-You Wu;Wei Shu	2003		10.1109/ICME.2003.1221356	routing;multicast;the internet;overlay network;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;graphics;telecommunications service;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;stress;distance vector multicast routing protocol;scattering;source-specific multicast;transport layer;xcast;computer network;multicast address;unicast	Networks	-7.2385860929954084	84.2831488750775	151532

These systems often exhibit common structural properties, such as the small-world property, and can react to changes in their environment with no centralized control. With ever-increasing capacity requirements, Transparent Optical Networks (TONs) have been established as the enabling technology for future long-haul high-speed backbone networks. Designing fast security mechanisms is critical, particularly due to the high speeds and transparency inherent in TONs. In this paper, we propose a self-organizing small-world control plane for failure management in TONs, which can improve scalability and adapt to changes in the network.	centralized computing;circuit restoration;computer simulation;control plane;feedback;information exchange;internet backbone;organizing (structure);overhead (computing);requirement;scalability;self-organization;small-world experiment	Nina Skorin-Kapov;Nicolas Puech	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74917-2_12	routing control plane;network planning and design;self-organization;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;computer network	Networks	-9.509974834467384	79.07278767825416	151650

The Thunder and Lightning network project at the University of California, Santa Barbara, is currently building a high-speed ATM switch in which each link operates at 40 Gb/s. The Instant Start protocol, developed for the Thunder and Lightning network, maximizes throughput by allowing transmission to begin without a reservation, while guaranteeing loss-free communication even when the network cannot handle the initial rate of transmission. Instant Start is able to provide this behavior when using first-in first-out (FIFO) buffers. This paper discusses the problems of exercising flow control in the high-speed Thunder and Lightning network and describes the techniques used by the Instant Start protocol to overcome them. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

2e52893fdcdbf448e453b03f99dc450a01fb3e56	sdn enhanced ethernet vpn for data center interconnect		Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) is an emerging technology that addresses the networking challenges presented by geo-distributed Data Centers (DCs). One of the major advantages of EVPN over legacy layer 2 VPN solutions is providing All-Active (A-A) mode of operation so that the traffic can truly be multi-homed on Provider Edge (PE) routers. However, A-A mode of operation introduces new challenges. In the case where the Customer Edge (CE) router is multi-homed to one or more PE routers, it is necessary that only one of the PE routers should forward Broadcast, Unknown unicast, and Multicast (BUM) traffic into the DC. The PE router that assumes the primary role for forwarding BUM traffic to the CE device is called the Designated Forwarder (DF). The proposed solution to select the DF in the EVPN standard is based on a distributed algorithm which has a number of drawbacks such as unfairness and intermittent behavior. In this paper, we introduce a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based architecture for EVPN support, where the SDN controller interacts with EVPN control plane. We demonstrate how our solution mitigates existing problems for DF selection which leads to improved EVPN performance.	block cipher mode of operation;control plane;customer edge;data center;designated verifier signature;direction finding;distributed algorithm;mpls vpn;multicast;multihoming;pdf/a;provider edge;router (computing);software-defined networking;unicast;virtual private network	Kyoomars Alizadeh Noghani;Andreas Kassler	2017	2017 IEEE 6th International Conference on Cloud Networking (CloudNet)	10.1109/CloudNet.2017.8071535	multicast;architecture;computer network;private network;provider edge;ethernet;software-defined networking;distributed computing;computer science;unicast;customer edge	Networks	-13.67058589461432	83.49339787241053	151729
1bb8e3e71b74f86ac47a838a2f8eee6a6b583ded	dynamic load balancing mechanism in mobile gateway with heterogeneous network		Due to the increasing popularity and the need for cloud computing systems, new paradigms and models such as fog and edge computing have recently emerged. The researches on mobile edge computing, including 5G, are focused on virtual network function placement for communication performance. Mobility studies of heterogeneous networks have been carried out in network mobility (NEMO), vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), and telematics technology. Mobile gateways play an important role in communication between things/mobile users and networks. However, mobile gateways have a difficulty on maintaining the communication link in a wireless environment due to obstacles and unstable connections with devices. In this paper proposes a dynamic load balancing approach in order that the multi-network mobile gateway (MNMG) distributes its traffic to one of several heterogeneous networks. For high utilization of networks, the MNMG distributes traffic dynamically by reflecting each network state. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, experiments is performed on real commercial networks consisting of the MNMG with the proposed load balancing were used in Korea, Thailand and India.	apollonian network;cloud computing;control theory;distance fog;edge computing;experiment;hoc (programming language);load balancing (computing);proxy mobile ipv6;telematics;transfer function	Taeheum Na;Hoyong Ryu;TaeYeon Kim;Jaehyung Park;Sangjin Hong;Pyungkoo Park	2018	2018 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2018.8539667	wireless network;vehicular ad hoc network;virtual network;mobile edge computing;load balancing (computing);heterogeneous network;computer network;edge computing;wireless ad hoc network;computer science	Mobile	-12.871407455088764	86.22419279995337	151744

These problems are exacerbated by the demands of next generation networks. Seamless Mobility is one such example, and is predicated on providing mechanisms that enable a user to accomplish his or her tasks without regard to technology. This paper examines a novel approach to policy-based management of wireless networks and devices, showing how various autonomic mechanisms can be used to realize the vision of Seamless Mobility, facilitating freedom of movement between indoor/outdoor and metropolitan/enterprise coverage while maintaining continuity of applications experience.	autonomic computing;next-generation network;radio frequency;scott continuity;seamless3d	John Strassner	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks	10.1109/WOWMOM.2007.4351737	next-generation network;telecommunications;computer science;technology management;resource management;wireless network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-14.117114177306677	87.80346817715987	152096
001aa64b2fc715e437b0bc4bd6ac172d428ea336	toward a flexible and scalable monitoring framework in software-defined networks	radiation detectors;computer architecture;monitoring;scalability;switches;proposals	Network traffic monitoring is an important factor to maintain stability and effective network management in software-defined networking (SDN). However, monitoring by current support of SDN architecture, i.e., OpenFlow, is neither flexible nor scalable due to the dependence to OpenFlow tables, which is designed mainly for forwarding. The scalability issue is even more serious when monitoring in network-wide with multiple switches because of the duplication of flow monitoring. With current SDN, a flow may be monitored at multiple switches if it traverses through them in the network. While in practical, only a single monitoring entry at a switch can be enough to monitor a flow. This duplication may cause significant overhead on switches, the controller and the controller-switch communication channel to handle the duplicated flow entries. Moreover, current SDN architecture has little support to balance the monitoring load overall network. Our previous work proposed SDN-Mon, a fine-grained and flexible monitoring solution for SDN that decouples monitoring from existing forwarding tables, for various network monitoring applications. In this paper, we propose an adaptive mechanism to enable network-wide monitoring in SDN with the support of SDN-Mon framework. With this mechanism, monitoring of a certain flow will be handled by only one single monitoring rule, instead of possibly multiple ones, thus reduces the load/overhead overall network. Moreover, the proposed mechanism also balances the monitoring load/overhead overall switches in the network by adaptively select only switches that have enough idle computing/memory resources to handle the monitoring task. Therefore, it supports preventing the overload and overflow problems by balancing and leveraging the idle computing/memory resources over network-wide.	channel (communications);network packet;network switch;openflow;overhead (computing);scalability;software-defined networking	Xuan Thien Phan;Kensuke Fukuda	2017	2017 31st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (WAINA)	10.1109/WAINA.2017.75	real-time computing;scalability;network switch;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;particle detector;computer security;computer network	OS	-13.886350169149535	81.66233897591717	152276
30240964c2438fbeff81e94ba5b4331dc025149e	exact approach for survivable regenerator placement in translucent wdm networks		Most studies addressing translucent network design targeted a tradeoff between minimizing the number of deployed regenerators and minimizing the number of regeneration sites. The latter highly depends on the carrierâs strategy and is motivated by various considerations such as power consumption, maintenance and supervision costs. However, concentrating regenerators into a small number of nodes exposes the network to a high risk of data losses in the eventual case of regenerator pool failure. In this paper, we address the problem of survivable translucent network design taking into account the simultaneous effect of four transmission impairments. We propose an exact approach based on a mathematical formulation to solve the problem of regenerator placement while ensuring the network survivability in the hazardous event of a regenerator pool failure. For this purpose, for each accepted request requiring regeneration, the network management plane computes in advance several routing paths along with associated valid wavelengths going through different regeneration sites. In doing so, we target to implement an M : N shared regenerator pool protection scheme. Simulation results highlight the gain obtained by reducing the number of regeneration sites without sacrificing network survivability.	like button;management plane;network planning and design;routing;simulation;wavelength-division multiplexing	Elias A.

63d43dc74d6f85059dcfda1b3f7f4306944788a5	sdn: evolution and opportunities in the development iot applications		The exponential growth of devices connected to the network has resulted in the development of new IoT applications and on-line services. However, these advances are limited by the rigidity of the current network infrastructure, in which the administrator has to implement high-level network policies adapting and configuring protocols manually and usually through a command line interface (CLI). At this point, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) appears as a viable alternative network architecture that allows for programming the network and opening the possibility of creating new services and more efficient applications to cover the actual requirements. In this paper, we describe this new technology and analyze its opportunities in the development of IoT applications. Similarly, we present the first applications and projects based on this technology. Finally, we discuss the issues and challenges in its implementation.	software-defined networking	Ãngel Leonardo Valdivieso Caraguay;Alberto Benito Peral;Lorena Isabel Barona LÃ³pez;L.

A common statistical output of passive probe is represented by probability mass functions (pmf). The need for consolidation of several pmfs arises in two contexts, namely: (i) whenever a central point collects and aggregates measurement of multiple disjoint vantage points, and (ii) whenever a local measurement processed at a single vantage point needs to be distributed over multiple cores of the same physical probe, in order to cope with growing link capacity. Taking an experimental approach, we study both cases assessing the impact of different consolidation strategies, obtaining general design and tuning guidelines.	semiconductor consolidation	Silvia Colabrese;Dario Rossi;Marco Mellia	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-04918-2_26	simulation;statistics	ML	-12.34399300417811	79.27029469551154	152668

The RMT problem is informally defined as the process of finding the best routing which maximizes the total bandwidth carried in the network, for a set of sessions, within a given TDM equipment budget. We propose a two-phase iterative optimization scheme (two-phase RMT). This scheme first obtains a basis solution used in routing 40Gb/s traffic only on OC-768 capable links without the use of TDM equipment. In the second phase, an iterative routing, re-routing, and resource allocation step is used to optimize the total bandwidth carried in the network while allowing 40Gb/s traffic to be routed on OC-768 incapable links by the proper installation of TDM multiplexors and demultiplexers at some strategic locations in the network. Numerical results demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach on a mesh-type heterogeneous topology.

In addition, the ever-increasing traffic demands of new applications and users can only be met by the huge bandwidth capacity provided by optical fibers. This work studies how to provide metro Ethernet services over transparent tunable-transmitter fixed-receiver WDM optical ring networks. A new adaptation layer of ME to WDM is proposed, and its benefits and drawbacks are studied. It is shown that such a transparent WDM ring network can be seen as a logical full-mesh topology by the upper ME layer, thus reducing to one the number of optical-electronic-optical conversions per unicast frame. Additionally, two different approaches are proposed in the case of broadcast/multicast traffic, since this may bring scalability difficulties in ring topologies.	mesh networking;metro ethernet;multicast;optical fiber;requirement;ring network;scalability;transmitter;unicast;wavelength-division multiplexing	Gerson RodrÃ­guez de los Santos;Manuel UrueÃ±a;JosÃ© Alberto HernÃ¡ndez;David Larrabeiti	2011	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2011.5687948	ring network;synchronous ethernet;rdma over converged ethernet;ethernet flow control;telecommunications;computer science;ata over ethernet;jumbo frame;optical fiber;autonegotiation;connection-oriented ethernet;metro ethernet;carrier ethernet;ethernet over sdh;optical switch;ethernet;ethernet over pdh;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network	Networks	-7.560381560271088	85.56869768847905	152964

To cope with such problem complexity, this paper presents the disjoint path-pair matrix (DPM) approach. With the DPM approach, the RWA problem complexity - i.e., the size of the solution space - can be significantly reduced by limiting the number of candidate path-pairs considered in the optimization. Simulation results are collected using the DPM approach to solve the online RWA problem in a network based on the shared path protection switching scheme with differentiated reliability. When compared to the conventional k-shortest paths approach, the DPM approach requires up to one order of magnitude less candidate path-pairs. In addition, the DPM approach finds solutions with reduced hop length of both the working and protection paths by up to 3% and 14%, respectively.	blocking (computing);feasible region;mathematical optimization;network topology;online and offline;path protection;provisioning;routing and wavelength assignment;shortest path problem;simulation;wavelength-division multiplexing	Marco Tacca;Paolo Monti;Andrea Fumagalli	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Communications (IEEE Cat.

In this paper, we study the structure and stability of origin advertisements in inter-domain routing. We visualize and quantitatively characterize the frequency, size, and effect of address assignment and origin changes by analyzing realworld BGP updates for a period of one year from multiple vantage points. Broad classes of prefix behaviors are developed. We show that a significant portion of BGP traffic is due to prefix flapping and explore the contributing factors which include a number of prefixes with abnormal short upand- down cycles. A significant portion of prefixes have high origin stability. Most ASes are involved in few, if any, prefix movement events, while a small number of ASes are responsible for most of the origin churn. Additionally, we find that a high volume of new prefixes can be attributed to actively evolving countries, that some abnormal prefix flapping is most likely due to misconfiguration, and that some culprit ASes characterize the places where multi-origin prefixes oscillate.	border gateway protocol;inter-domain;link-local address;routing	Sophie Y.

(algorithmes centralisÃ©s et distribuÃ©s pour le routage basÃ© sur la qualitÃ© d'expÃ©rience dans les rÃ©seaux sans-fil)		Wireless and mobile networks have become an important part in our modern society. Thanks to ubiquitous wireless connectivity, people can connect to the Internet anytime and anywhere. Video streaming is one of the most popular services on the Internet and it covers from 70% to 82% of all Internet traffic. Modern infrastructure networks, such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), are prospective solutions for video streaming because of their high data rates. Nevertheless, the high implementation cost and the lack of compatibility of usersâ equipment prevent them from practical deployment. Moreover, infrastructure networks may not be available in some cases such as after disasters or in a rural area. In these scenarios, wireless mesh networks (WMNs) become a promising alternative because of its easy deployment, low cost, and recovery ability. The decisive component of WMNs is the routing algorithm in which the end-to-end routes are determined. Most of existing routing algorithms are based on single or combination of network-oriented metrics. Consequently, routing decisions may not correlate with user experience or Quality of Experience (QoE). This thesis addresses the QoE-aware routing of video streaming over WMNs and proposes centralized and decentralized routing algorithms that take user-oriented metrics into account. The results confirm the advantages of using QoE concept in routing algorithms.		Pham Tran Anh Quang	2017				Mobile	-9.94341470017068	85.61689111426956	153317

We provide a detailed measurement study to shed light on how modern web service deployments use the cloud and to identify ways in which cloud-using services might improve these deployments. Our results show that: 4% of the Alexa top million use EC2/Azure; there exist several common deployment patterns for cloud-using web service front ends; and services can significantly improve their wide-area performance and failure tolerance by making better use of existing regional diversity in EC2.

We highlight four key findings: (1) the best placement and re- placement strategies depend on the cache size and vary across improvement metrics; that said, LFU+probabilistic caching [37] is a close-to-optimal strategy overall; (2) video workloads show considerable caching-related benefits (e.g., -- 10% traffic reduction) only with very large cache sizes (â¥ 100GB); (3) the improvement in video QoE is low (â¥ 12%) if the content provider already has a substantial geographical presence; and (4) caches in the middle and the edge of the network, requests from highly populated regions and without content servers, and requests for popular content contribute most to the overall ICN-induced improvements in video QoE.	algorithm;cache (computing);fifo (computing and electronics);icn gps;least frequently used;population	Yi Sun;Seyed Kaveh Fayaz;Yang Guo;Vyas Sekar;Yun Jin;Mohamed Ali KÃ¢afar;Steve Uhlig	2014		10.1145/2674005.2675003	real-time computing;computer science;operating system;world wide web;computer network	Metrics	-16.02054013235595	75.53280029506074	153884

Many such applications require that the monitoring infrastructure provide high flow coverage and support fine-grained network-wide objectives. Coordinated Sampling (cSamp) is a recent proposal that improves the monitoring capabilities of ISPs to address these demands. In this paper, we address a key deployment impediment for cSamp-like solutions-the need for routers to determine the Origin-Destination (OD) pair of each packet. In practice, however, this information is not available without expensive changes. We present a new framework called cSamp-T, in which each router uses only local information, instead of the OD-pair identifiers. Leveraging results from the theory of maximizing sub-modular set functions, cSamp-T provides near-ideal performance in maximizing the total flow coverage in the network. Further, with a small amount of targeted upgrades to a few routers, cSamp-T nearly optimally maximizes the minimum fractional coverage across all OD-pairs. We demonstrate these results on a range of real topologies.	algorithm;identifier;network packet;overhead (computing);provisioning;router (computing);routing;sans institute;sampling (signal processing);software deployment	Vyas Sekar;Anupam Gupta;Mike K.

The network sharing paradigm was explored in the past and partially deployed. Nowadays, advanced mobile network multi-tenancy approaches are increasingly gaining momentum, paving the way toward further decreasing capital expenditure and operational expenditure (CAPEX/OPEX) costs, while enabling new business opportunities. This article provides an overview of the 3GPP standard evolution from network sharing principles, mechanisms, and architectures to future on-demand multi-tenant systems. In particular, it introduces the concept of the 5G Network Slice Broker in 5G systems, which enables mobile virtual network operators, over-the-top providers, and industry vertical market players to request and lease resources from infrastructure providers dynamically via signaling means. Finally, it reviews the latest standardization efforts, considering remaining open issues for enabling advanced network slicing solutions, taking into account the allocation of virtualized network functions based on ETSI NFV, the introduction of shared network functions, and flexible service chaining.	business requirements;cost efficiency;multitenancy;network function virtualization;over-the-top content;programming paradigm;provisioning;requirement;software deployment	Konstantinos Samdanis;Xavier PÃ©rez Costa;Vincenzo Sciancalepore	2016	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2016.7514161	radio access network;intelligent network;simulation;intelligent computer network;network architecture;public land mobile network;telecommunications;computer science;network information system;operating system;mobile business development;mobile computing;computer security;computer network;mobile payment	Metrics	-14.97531639124555	86.07806379167334	154113
775450e16f5716bc7c4ea68789df82b5fc9dff58	deep reinforcement learning for resource management in network slicing		Network slicing is born as an emerging business to operators by allowing them to sell the customized slices to various tenants at different prices. In order to provide better-performing and cost-efficient services, network slicing involves challenging technical issues and urgently looks forward to intelligent innovations to make the resource management consistent with usersâ activities per slice. In that regard, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which focuses on how to interact with the environment by trying alternative actions and reinforcing the tendency actions producing more rewarding consequences, is assumed to be a promising solution. In this paper, after briefly reviewing the fundamental concepts of DRL, we investigate the application of DRL in solving some typical resource management for network slicing scenarios, which include radio resource slicing and priority-based core network slicing, and demonstrate the advantage of DRL over several competing schemes through extensive simulations. Finally, we also discuss the possible challenges to apply DRL in network slicing from a general perspective.		Rongpeng Li;Zenghui Zhao;Q.

In the normal mode of operation, each connection uses a primary path to deliver packets from the source to the destination. To ensure continuous operation in the event of an edge failure, each connection uses a set of backup bridges, each bridge protecting a portion of the primary path. To meet the bandwidth requirement of the connection, a certain amount of bandwidth must be allocated on the edges of primary path, as well as on the backup edges. In this paper, we focus on minimizing the amount of required backup allocation by sharing backup bandwidth among different connections. We consider efficient sharing schemes that require only partial information about the current state of the network. In particular, the only information available for each edge is the total amount of primary allocation and the cost of allocating backup bandwidth on this edge. We consider the problem of finding a minimum cost backup allocation together with a set of bridges for a given primary path. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and present an approximation algorithm whose performance is within O(log n) of the optimum, where n is the number of edges in the primary path.	approximation algorithm;backup;bandwidth (signal processing);block cipher mode of operation;continuous operation;np-hardness;normal mode;telecommunications network	Yigal Bejerano;Joseph Naor;Alexander Sprintson	2005		10.1007/11561071_62	mathematical optimization;normal mode;computer science;theoretical computer science;dynamic programming;np-hard;mathematics;distributed computing;service quality;complete information;approximation algorithm;algorithm;telecommunications network;bandwidth allocation	Theory	-5.315593123138163	77.71253014494377	154353

This enables pipelining multiple banyans. It is observed that the ratio of throughput to switching delay (service rate) is relatively low in the PB due to the banyan. For this, we present a scalable pipelined ATM switch architecture employing a family of Dilated Banyan (DB) networks together with their complexity analysis and performance. A DB can be engineered between two extremes: (1) a low-cost banyan with internal and external conflicts, or (2) a high-cost conflict-free fully-connected network with multiple outlets. Between the two extremes lies a family of DBs having different switching delays and throughputs. Increasing the dilation degree reduces path conflicts, which produces noticeable increase in service rate due to increase in throughput and decrease in path delay. Compared to PB, the Pipelined Dilated Banyan (PDB) requires less number of data planes for the same throughput, or provides higher throughput for a given number of data planes. Simulation of PDB was carried out under uniform traffic and simulated ATM traffic. We study performance under variation in the load, buffer size, and number of data planes. To analyse the robustness of the switch, we show that performance is not degradable under ATM traffic with temporal and spatial burstiness generated by using the ON-OFF model and some traffic mixes. The PDB is scalable with respect to service rate and can be engineered with respect to: (1) cell loss rate, (2) hardware resources, (3) size of buffers, (4) switching delays, and (5) delay incurred to higher priority traffic. The PDB can deliver up to 3.5 times the service rate of the PB with linear increase in hardware cost.	atm turbo;alternating turing machine;analysis of algorithms;banyan vines;control plane;dilation (morphology);forwarding plane;network switch;network topology;pipeline (computing);priority queue;protein data bank;scalability;simulation;throughput	Mayez A.

The goal of this work is to gain a better understanding of disruptions in communication services in response to large-scale external disturbances such as hurricanes. In particular, Hurricane Ike is drawn as a case study, and heterogeneous data is obtained from networks, storm, and system administrators. Using the data, we first study network-wide disruptions and dependences among different unreachable subnets. Our findings show that 120 out of 230 subnets in our data set were unreachable, among which 88 subnets became unreachable dependently at a time scale of seconds or less than three minutes. We then study dependencies between communication service-disruptions and external factors such as weather and power. Unreachable subnets are found to be weakly correlated with the storm. Power outages and lack of spare power are reported to be certain causes of communication disruptions. New research issues emerge for information acquisition across communication and power infrastructures as well as weather, and information sharing among organizations.	denial-of-service attack;emoticon;hurricane weather research and forecasting model;internet key exchange;subnetwork;system administrator;unreachable memory	Supaporn Erjongmanee;Chuanyi Ji	2011	IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management	10.1109/TNSM.2011.110311.110106	border gateway protocol;telecommunications;tropical cyclone;computer science;organization;telecommunications service;routing protocol;storm;computer security;correlation;computer network	Visualization	-11.956719108843638	78.53001883781215	154647

This paper deals with DTN communication from Moon to Earth, based on the use of a lunar satellite acting as a âdata-muleâ to collect data from a Lander located on the far side of the Moon. To make the scenario more interesting and complex from the point of view of possible security threats, we assume that data must be transferred to a non-institutional user connected to the Space Agency Control Centre via Internet. In particular, the paper investigates the state-of-the-art ability of ION, the NASA implementation of the DTN Bundle Protocol (BP), to cope with the many challenges of the space scenario under investigation, such as intermittent links, low bandwidth, relatively high delays, network partitioning, DTN routing, interoperability between LTP and TCP BP Convergence layers and security threats. To this end, the first part of the paper contains three brief overviews of the DTN architecture, the Bundle Security Protocol and the ION implementation.

It is âconnectivity-orientedâ without support for user or data multihoming. However, the swift migration of Internet from âconnectivity-orientedâ to âcontent-orientedâ pattern urges to incorporate user and data level multihoming support in architecture designs instead of just through ad-hoc patches. In this paper, based on our previous research experience, we expand the multihoming concepts to both user and data levels based on the âmultiple points of attachmentâ in a way similar to host multihoming. We propose a new incrementally-deployable multihoming framework by introducing a ârealmâ concept. The high-level user and data multihoming support can be built on top of the host and AS level multihoming in an incrementally-deployable and flexibly-assembled manner. Realms form a hierarchy of functionally dependable blocks. We define a new dimension of building blockâslice which is an incrementally implementable functional unit for multihoming. Besides the long-term support for user and data multihoming, the first step deployment of the new framework is also able to address the short-term routing scalability challenge by reducing the total inter-domain routing table size gradually.	attachments;autonomous system (internet);execution unit;future internet;high- and low-level;hoc (programming language);inter-domain;long-term support;multihoming;realms;routing table;scalability;software deployment;swift (programming language)	Jianli Pan;Raj Jain;Subharthi Paul	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503518	computer science;distributed computing;multihoming;world wide web;computer network	Networks	-10.390265047168104	80.59056366793605	154707

Furthermore, the captured graph snapshots can be used, among other important purposes, as traces for simulation studies, to validate existing simulation models, to design and implement targeted attacks, or to detect anomalies. Motivated by the importance of the purposes above as well as the popularity of several Kademlia-like networks, we present a new crawler aiming to capture snapshots of the connectivity graph of the entire KAD network. The crawler's design is generic and adaptable for Kademlia-like and other structured P2P networks. The results show that the crawler is fast and captures high accurate graph snapshots. Furthermore, its design enables it to outperform prior KAD crawlers significantly in terms of the time and the number of crawling messages that are required to download nodes' routing tables. The crawls that we conducted at different times between April 2012 and February 2013 show that KAD is still widely-used in terms of total observed users.

In the telco world, cloud computing is currently mostly used by mobile network operators (MNO) for hosting non-critical support services and selling cloud services such as applications and data storage. MNOs are investigating the use of cloud computing to deliver key telecommunication services in the access and core networks. Without this, MNOs lose the opportunities of both combining this with over-the-top (OTT) and value-added services to their fundamental service offerings and leveraging cost-effective commodity hardware. Being able to leverage cloud computing technology effectively for the telco world is the focus of mobile cloud networking (MCN). This paper presents the key results of MCN integrated project that includes its architecture advancements, prototype implementation, and evaluation. Results show the efficiency and the simplicity that a MNO can deploy and manage the complete service lifecycle of fully cloudified, composed services that combine OTT/IT- and mobile-network-based services running on commodity hardware. The extensive performance evaluation of MCN using two key proof-of-concept scenarios that compose together many services to deliver novel converged elastic, on-demand mobile-based but innovative OTT services proves the feasibility of such fully virtualized deployments. Results show that it is beneficial to extend cloud computing to telco usage and run fully cloudified mobile-network-based systems with clear advantages and new service opportunities for MNOs and end-users.	agile software development;commodity computing;computer data storage;control plane;converged storage;download;elasticity (data store);electronic product code;end-to-end principle;entity;event-driven process chain;forwarding plane;itil;image scaling;integrated project support environment;lxc;load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;mobile cloud computing;network architecture;network function virtualization;network packet;operating system service management;over-the-top content;parallel computing;performance evaluation;platform as a service;private network;programming paradigm;prototype;provisioning;requirement;scalability;seamless3d;service composability principle;software as a service;software deployment;testbed;topological sorting;virtual machine	Bruno Sousa;LuÃ­s Cordeiro;Paulo SimÃµes;Andy Edmonds;Santiago Ruiz;Giuseppe A.

Dynamic routing implies routing of requests that arrive one-by-one with no a priori knowledge of future arrivals, and so necessitating use of on-line algorithms. Local restorability means that upon a link or node failure, the first node upstream from the failure must be able to switch the path to an alternate preset outgoing link so that path continuity with bandwidth guarantees is restored by a strictly local decision. The motivation for use of local restoration is that it is much faster than path restoration because failure information does not have to propagate to the source. Local restoration implies that to successfully route a path set-up request an active (primary) path, and a bypass backup path for every link and node used by the active path must be determined . This locally restorable on-line routing problem is becoming particularly important in optical networks and in MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching) based networks due to the trend toward dynamic provisioning of bandwidth guaranteed or wavelength paths. To prevent excessive resource usage for backup paths, and to satisfy the implicit service provider requirement of optimizing network resource utilization so as to increase the number of potential future demands that can be routed, it is desirable to judiciously share backup paths while still maintaining local restorability. The best sharing performance is achieved if the routing of every path in progress in the network is known to the routing algorithm at the time of a new path set-up. However, this requires maintenance of non-aggregated or per-path information which is not often desirable particularly when distributed routing is preferred. We show that a partial information scenario which uses only aggregated and not per-path information provides sufficient information for efficient dynamic routing of locally restorable bandwidth guaranteed paths. In this partial information scenario the routing algorithm only knows what fraction of each linkâs bandwidth, is currently used by active paths, and is currently used by backup paths. Obtaining this information is feasible using proposed traffic engineering extensions to routing protocols. We develop efficient dynamic routing algorithms for bandwidth guaranteed paths that are locally restorable under single link or node failure. The routing is done using a sequence of shortest path computations, and it permits sharing of backup paths between requests as well as between the backup paths for different network elements for the same request. We compare the routing performance of our algorithm to other known restoration schemes. Our partial information based locally restorable algorithm performs very well in terms of the number of rejected requests and total bandwidth usage.	backup;circuit restoration;computation;multiprotocol label switching;online algorithm;online and offline;provisioning;routing;scott continuity;shortest path problem	Murali S.

Several researchers have proposed highly-redundant topologies with multiple paths between pairs of end hosts for datacenter networks. However, traffic management is necessary to effectively utilize the bisection bandwidth provided by these topologies. This requires timely detection of elephant flowsâflows that carry large amount of dataâand managing those flows. Previously proposed approaches incur high monitoring overheads, consume significant switch resources, and/or have long detection times. We propose, instead, to detect elephant flows at the end hosts. We do this by observing the end hosts's socket buffers, which provide better, more efficient visibility of flow behavior. We present Mahout, a low-overhead yet effective traffic management system that follows OpenFlow-like central controller approach for network management but augments the design with our novel end host mechanism. Once an elephant flow is detected, an end host signals the network controller using in-band signaling with low overheads. Through analytical evaluation and experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of Mahout over previous solutions.	apache mahout;bisection bandwidth;data center;elephant flow;experiment;interconnection;network interface controller;openflow;overhead (computing)	Andrew R.

Although Edge Computing is receiving significant attention at present, many issues relating to this paradigm remain unclear. In this paper, we focus specifically on mechanisms required to extend Data Centre networking technologies to edge devices. More specifically, we describe the solution we have developed which enables Open Virtual Networking (OVN) to be extended to the edge to support integration with a docker engine located at the edge of the network. The mechanisms consist of a process by which a docker engine can request to join the network, an approval process which leverages Openstack authentication and access control mechanisms, a mechanism by which the remote system can connect to the OVN and finally containers can be initialized on the remote docker engine and interact with entities operating in the Enterprise Data Centre.

Their high dynamicity and heterogeneity present significant challenges from the communications perspective, which call for the adoption of new paradigms based on opportunistic and Information-Centric Networking (ICN) approaches. Applications operating in next-generation environments have peculiar characteristics that could benefit from ICN-based middleware solutions. This paper presents ICeDiM, a middleware we designed for ICN communications in next-generation scenarios, which builds on top of the innovative concept of Application-level Dissemination Channels (ADCs) with tunable permeability levels. A thorough and in-depth experimental evaluation of ICeDiM in a next-generation environment realistically simulated using ICeONE, a modified version of the well-known ONE simulator, demonstrates that our approach can achieve very good performance levels in terms of delivery ratio and network resource consumption.	adobe flash;algorithm;cache (computing);computation;icn gps;middleware;next-generation network;programming paradigm;proxy server;refinement (computing);relevance;simulation;smart city;software deployment;sparse matrix;transistorâtransistor logic;whole earth 'lectronic link	Alessandro Morelli;Mauro Tortonesi;Cesare Stefanelli;Niranjan Suri	2017	J.

Specifically, it examines some issues of topology aggregation for hierarchical PNNI Routing in ATM networks, presents a complex node representation, and provides some guidelines for topology aggregation. There are two main reasons for topology aggregation. First, topology information must be compressed to avoid excessive complexity in topology adevertisement. Second, the internal topology of a network may have to be hidden for security reasons. A desirable topology aggregation method must adequately represent the topology of a given network for efficient routing and netowrk resource allocation, using a compact advertised topology.	atm turbo;network topology;routing;telecommunications network	Whay C.

This work quantifies the degree to which at least two important Internet measures--latency and bandwidth--approximate tree metrics. We evaluate our ability to model end-to-end measures using tree embeddings by actually building tree representations. In addition to being simple and intuitive models, these trees provide a range of commonly-required functionality beyond serving as an analytical tool.  The contributions of our study are twofold. First, we investigate the ability to portray the inherent hierarchical structure of the Internet using the most pure and compact topology, trees. Second, we evaluate the ability of our compact representation to facilitate many natural tasks, such as the selection of servers with short latency or high bandwidth from a client. Experiments show that these tasks can be done with high degree of success and modest overhead.	approximation algorithm;end-to-end principle;internet;overhead (computing);server (computing)	Venugopalan Ramasubramanian;Dahlia Malkhi;Fabian Kuhn;Mahesh Balakrishnan;Archit Gupta;Aditya Akella	2009		10.1145/1555349.1555357	latency;simulation;internet topology;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;empirical research;bandwidth;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-10.712806175125289	77.70087742873105	155452

The open architecture, achieved scale, and self-organizing structure of the Gnutella network make it an interesting P2P architecture to study. Like most other P2P applications, Gnutella builds, at the application level, a virtual network with its own routing mechanisms. The topology of this overlay network and the routing mechanisms used have a significant influence on application properties such as performance, reliability, and scalability. We describe techniques to discover and analyze the GnutellaÂs overlay network topology and evaluate generated network traffic. Our major findings are: (1) although Gnutella is not a pure power-law network, its current configuration has the benefits and drawbacks of a power-law structure, (2) we estimate the aggregated volume of generated traffic, and (3) the Gnutella virtual network topology does not match well the underlying Internet topology, hence leading to ineffective use of the physical networking infrastructure. We believe that our findings as well as our measurement and analysis techniques have broad applicability to P2P systems and provide useful insights into P2P system design tradeoffs.	gnutella;internet topology;network topology;network traffic control;open architecture;organizing (structure);overlay network;peer-to-peer;programming paradigm;routing;scalability;self-organization;software deployment;systems design	Matei Ripeanu;Ian T.

However, in heterogeneous environments, VWSANs raise new challenges, such as the need for on-the-fly, dynamic, elastic, and scalable provisioning of gateways. NFV is a paradigm emerging to help tackle these new challenges. It leverages standard virtualization technology to consolidate special-purpose network elements on commodity hardware. This article presents NFV architecture for VWSAN gateways, in which software instances of gateway modules are hosted in NFV infrastructure operated and managed by a VWSAN gateway provider. We consider several VWSAN providers, each with its own brand or combination of brands of sensors and actuators/ robots. These sensors and actuators can be accessed by a variety of applications, each of which may have different interface and QoS (latency, throughput, etc.) requirements. The NFV infrastructure allows dynamic, elastic, and scalable deployment of gateway modules in this heterogeneous VWSAN environment. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is flexible enough to easily allow integration of new sensors and actuators, and accommodation of new application domains. We present a prototype that is built using the OpenStack platform. Performance results are also discussed.	as-interface;application domain;commodity computing;network function virtualization;programming paradigm;prototype;provisioning;quality of service;requirement;robot;scalability;sensor;software deployment;throughput;x86 virtualization	Carla Mouradian;Tonmoy Saha;Jagruti Sahoo;Mohammad Abu-Lebdeh;Roch H.

This problem will be one of the main technical challenges to be faced in the evolution towards Future Networks (FN). Emerging paradigms such as Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NfV) are concrete steps towards infrastructures where network functions and services will be executed as applications in ensembles of virtual machines (VMs) hosted in pervasive standard hardware resources located across a network. The paper argues that in order to manage these virtual infrastructures there is a need to introduce high-level systems orchestration. The paper describes an architecture based on an orchestrater that ensures the automatic placement of the virtual nodes and the allocation of network services on them, supported by a monitoring system that collects and reports on the behaviour of the resources. The orchestrater manages the creation and removal of the virtual nodes, as well as configuring, monitoring, running and stopping software on them. As a proof of these concepts, a distributed orchestrater prototype has been designed, implemented and tested with the results of different placement algorithms presented.	algorithm;data center;embedded system;high- and low-level;network function virtualization;orchestration (computing);prototype;router (computing);scalability;software-defined networking;testbed;virtual machine;virtual private network;virtual reality	Stuart Clayman;Elisa Maini;Alex Galis;Antonio Manzalini;Nicola Mazzocca	2014	2014 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS)	10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838412	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;resource management;operating system;hardware architecture;distributed computing;orchestration;management;computer security;computer network;placement;technology	Networks	-17.133942030777867	82.98506867531556	155798

In addition, Hierarchical address auto configuration strategy is adopted. First of all, inside the bottom network, it allows nodes to use link local address derived by 16-bit short address for data packet transmission. Secondly, Sink node in each underlying network accesses to the global routing prefix through the upper IP router, and combined with interface identifier, it forms Sink node global address, and realizes wireless sensor network and Internet data exchange. The research results show that the strategy has certain superiority in network cost, throughput, energy consumption and other performances. In summary, the proposed addressing strategy has the characteristics of effectively integrating heterogeneous networks, reducing system energy consumption, increasing network throughput and ensuring real-time system performance for the future Internet of things.	internet of things	Yuankun Yang;Yongqing Ji	2017	iJOE		gateway address;computer network;embedded system;wireless network;internet connection sharing;ip address management;ipv6 address;wireless wan;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;link-local address;distributed computing;computer science	Mobile	-11.39394995056343	88.50654755766935	155819

Such a service typically is provided through either live or time-shifted program multicast. While the former requires adequate bandwidth for a combination of unicast, multicast or broadcast, the latter typically leverages caching. Both modes of distribution have hard resource constraints. Determination of effective tradeoffs between transmission-constrained multicast and storage-constrained caching presents a significant challenge, particularly in a bandwidth-limited wireless environment. We describe a general analytical model for efficient and effective solutions to these multi-dimensional problems in content delivery networks. We illustrate the utility of this analytical framework via a prototypical scenario in personalized wireless video services.	approximation;cache (computing);content delivery network;digital distribution;digital video recorder;mathematical optimization;multicast;personalization;provisioning;simulation;television;unicast;whole earth 'lectronic link;zipf's law;zipfâmandelbrot law	Sem C.

The proposed scheme is designed to work under shared backup path protection policy and attempts to minimize the conflict between unavailability per connection and resource overbuild. It is adapted into a conventional two-step availability-constrained connection provisioning scheme. We evaluate the performance of this dynamic shareability driven connection provisioning scheme in terms of unavailability per connection and resource consumption as applied to NSFNET and EON topologies. Simulation results show that dynamic shareability driven connection provisioning scheme reduces the unavailability per connection by not violating the resource consumption as much as the dedicated path protection.	algorithm;backup;information privacy;national science foundation network;path protection;provisioning;simulation;transport layer security;unavailability	Burak Kantarci;H.

As P2P platforms, mobile devices connected to the Internet through WiFi or cellular networks are different from wired devices in two main aspects: (1) higher churn due to mobility, weak wireless signals, or battery constraints, and (2) significant variability in bandwidth and latency based on the point of attachment. These problems affect the stored content availability and skew the content serving load over the peers. MobiStore structures the mobile P2P network into clusters of redundant peers. The topology uses both algorithmically-defined and random edges among the peers of different clusters. The routing information is updated using a gossip-based protocol. Thus, MobiStore achieves, with high probability, O(1) lookup operations despite high churn and link variability. Inside the clusters, all peers replicate the content, which improves the content availability. Furthermore, based on the current load, MobiStore dynamically changes the number of peers inside the clusters and routes content request to randomly selected peers. These two dynamic techniques along with using consistent hashing to map content to peers, balance the load over the peers. While some of these techniques are well known, the main contribution is on the novel ways of applying them to design and implement an efficient mobile P2P data store. Simulation results show MobiStore achieves an availability, i.e., lookup success rate, between 12%-48% higher than two baseline systems built over the MR-Chord and Chord P2P protocol; and reduces the latency up to 9 times. Finally, the results show MobiStore adapts to churn and workload Mohammad A Khan, Cristian Borcea Department of Computer Science, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA.

Application-level overl ays, however, incur a performance penalty over router-level solutions. This paper characterizes this performance penalt y for overlay multicast trees via experimental data, simulations, and theoretical models. Experimental data and simulations illustrate that (i) the average delay and the number of hops between parent and child hosts in overlay trees generally decrease, and (ii) the degree of hosts generally d ecreases, as the level of the host in the overlay tree increase s. Overlay multicast routing strategies, together withpowerlaw and small-world Internet topology characteristics, ar e causes of the observed phenomena. We compare three overlay multicast protocols with respect to latency, bandwidth , router degrees, and host degrees. We also quantify the overlay tree cost. Results reveal that L(n) U(n) / n0:9 for smalln, whereL(n) is the total number of hops in all overlay links, U(n) is the average number of hops on the source to receiver unicast paths, and n is the number of members in the overlay multicast session.	communications protocol;computer simulation;experiment;internet topology;multicast;overhead (computing);overlay network;peer-to-peer;router (computing);routing;traceroute;unicast	Sonia Fahmy;Minseok Kwon	2003		10.1109/ICNP.2003.1249757	power law;multicast;the internet;overlay network;internet topology;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;telecommunications service;distributed computing;network topology;xcast;computer network	Networks	-9.332177141980686	78.78466602117074	156064

We present CloudMirror, a solution that provides bandwidth guarantees to cloud applications based on a new network abstraction and workload placement algorithm. An effective network abstraction should enable applications to easily and accurately specify their requirements, while simultaneously enabling the infrastructure to provision resources efficiently for deployed applications. Prior research has approached the bandwidth guarantee specification by using abstractions that resemble physical network topologies. We present a contrasting approach of deriving a network abstraction based on application communication structure, called Tenant Application Graph or TAG. CloudMirror also incorporates a new workload placement algorithm that efficiently meets bandwidth requirements specified by TAGs while factoring in high availability considerations. Extensive simulations using real application traces and datacenter topologies show that CloudMirror can handle 40% more bandwidth demand than the state of the art (e.g., the Oktopus system), while improving high availability from 20% to 70%.	algorithm;cloud computing;data center;experiment;high availability;integer factorization;mission critical;network topology;requirement;simulation;tracing (software)	Jeongkeun Lee;Yoshio Turner;Myungjin Lee;Lucian Popa;Sujata Banerjee;Joon-Myung Kang;Puneet Sharma	2014		10.1145/2619239.2626326	real-time computing;distributed computing;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Networks	-12.087038850565282	81.6430664595949	156433

Our contribution characterizes development of human-readable, hierarchical ID-based unified addressing for both objects and services, corresponding to their locations. In this way, users gain easier access to the IoT resources and native support for multicast. Furthermore, we take advantage of the Networking Named Content approach to specify rules for ID-based data transfer. The network nodes have capabilities to cache forwarded data for handling future requests, what may decrease network overload and facilitate cooperation between applications and sensors which periodically move into sleep mode for saving energy. ID-based routing offers decoupling of identification of objects/services from their location. Awareness of forwarded IoT data together with hierarchical distribution of the network makes feasible the local management of users and objects, that is, the essential IoT processes such as object/service registration, publication, searching and resolution can be managed locally in the network node. This offers high flexibility and manageability and improves response of the system when the number of handled things scales. The paper presents the architecture of the proposed solution for ID layer focusing on modules and mechanisms of the ID network node, as well as detailed description of registration, resolution and forwarding processes. Furthermore, the implementation of the system, performed on Linux-based routers, was tested to confirm the correctness of ID layer processes. The tests show that the performance of ID network node is not worse than the performance of a classical IP Linux router running on an identical physical device.	abstraction layer;addressing scheme;coexist (image);concatenation;conformance testing;control plane;correctness (computer science);coupling (computer programming);embedded system;end-to-end principle;entity;forwarding plane;human-readable medium;internet of things;level of detail;linux;linux;machine to machine;multicast;multiprotocol label switching;online locator service;operating system;peripheral;protocol stack;prototype;router (computing);routing;scalability;sensor;sleep mode;streaming media;tunneling protocol;user space	Jordi Mongay Batalla;Piotr Krawiec	2013	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-013-0664-0	humanâcomputer interaction;computer science;operating system;world wide web;computer security;internet of things;computer network	Mobile	-13.922857555172493	83.87067605180509	156699

We show how this tool performs different types of synchronisation tasks in a real Grid testbed. The Grid coordination protocol (GCP) is described, then its implementation, validation and usage, in the context of the European DataGrid project, are presented. We illustrate how GCP is used for network performance measurement coordination, for monitoring equipment configuration synchronisation and also for Grid network topology discovery operations.	egi;games computers play;grid network;intelligent agent;network performance;network topology;testbed	Robert Harakaly;Pascale Vicat-Blanc Primet;Franck Bonnassieux	2004	IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid, 2004.

The detour is such that failed links or nodes can be bypassed locally from the first node that is upstream from the failures. This local bypass activation from the first detection point for failures permits much faster recovery than end-to-end path based mechanisms that require failure information to propagate to the network edges. However, local restoration of bandwidth guaranteed connections can be expensive in the additional network capacity needed. Hence, it is important to minimize and share restoration capacity. The problem of routing with local restoration requirements has been studied previously in a dynamic on-line setting. However, there are no satisfactory algorithms for the problem of pre-provisioning fast restorable connections when the aggregate traffic demands are known (as would be the case when a set of routers are to be interconnected over an optical network or for pre-provisioned ATM over MPLS overlays). The contribution of this paper is a fast combinatorial approximation algorithm for maximizing throughput when the routed traffic is required to be locally restorable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first combinatorial algorithm for the problem with a performance guarantee. Our algorithm is a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS), i.e., for any given epsiv > 0, it guarantees (1+epsiv)-factor closeness to the optimal solution, and runs in time polynomial in the network size and [ 1/( epsiv)]. We compare the throughput of locally restorable routing with that of unprotected routing and 1+1-dedicated path protection on actual US/European ISP topologies taken from the Rocketfuel project .	atm turbo;aggregate data;approximation algorithm;centrality;circuit restoration;combinatorial optimization;end-to-end encryption;multiprotocol label switching;node (computer science);online and offline;path protection;polynomial;polynomial-time approximation scheme;provisioning;requirement;routing;throughput;time complexity	Randeep Bhatia;Murali S.

We propose two multichannel time slot sorters which sort N/sup 2/ time-division multiplexed (TDM) optical inputs, arranged as N frames with N time slots per frame using O(Nlog/sup 2/N) optical switch elements. The TDM optical inputs are sorted in place without expanding the space-time fabric into a space-division switch. The hardware components used are 2/spl times/2 optical switches (LiNbO/sub 3/ directional couplers) and optical delay lines connected in a feedforward fashion. Two space-time variants of the spatial odd-even merge algorithm are used to design the sorters. By maintaining the number of shift-exchange operations invariant at each stage, the proposed sorters use fewer switches than previously proposed sorters using switches with feedback line delays. The use of local control at each 2/spl times/2 switch makes the proposed sorters more practical for high-speed optical inputs than Benes-based time slot permuters with global control and high latency, which affects interframe distance. Both time slot sorters support pipelining of input frames and sorted outputs are available at each time slot after an initial frame delay. The proposed sorters find practical application in the time-domain equivalents of space-division, nonblocking, self-routing packet switches using the sort-banyan architecture, such as the Starlite switch, Sunshine switch, etc.	sorting network	Rajgopal Kannan;Daeshik Lee;Kyungsook Y.

A NMS (Network Management System) is required to support emerging services through the complex network structure. In this paper, we present an on-going work called SOLA (Smart One-view Look and Analysis) to integrate the existing NMSs. SOLA has three remarkable features. First, it can reduce the CAPEX/OPEX by sharing a common platform. Second, since SOLA is a web application complied with HTML 5, it can be run on emerging smart devices such as smart phone and table PC as well. Lastly, it can provide an end-to-end analysis since the event messages are collected from an entire network.	common platform;complex network;end-to-end encryption;html;html5;management system;no man's sky;smart device;smartphone;table computer;web application	Ju-Won Park;Seongbok Baik;Chan Kyou Hwang;Young-Woo Lee	2012	2012 18th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2012.6388137	network management station;computer science;database;network management application;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	-19.05657131887794	86.52636878808894	157126

Topology recovery via tomographic inference is potentially an attractive complement to standard methods that use TTL-limited probes. In this paper, we describe new techniques that aim toward the practical use of tomographic inference for accurate router-level topology measurement. Specifically, prior tomographic techniques have required an infeasible number of probes for accurate, large scale topology recovery. We introduce a Depth-First Search (DFS) Ordering algorithm that clusters end host probe targets based on shared infrastructure, and enables the logical tree topology of the network to be recovered accurately and efficiently. We evaluate the capabilities of our DFS Ordering topology recovery algorithm in simulation and find that our method uses 94% fewer probes than exhaustive methods and 50% fewer than the current state-of-the-art. We also present results from a case study in the live Internet where we show that DFS Ordering can recover the logical router-level topology more accurately and with fewer probes than prior techniques.	algorithm;depth-first search;experiment;internet research;internet topology;logical topology;map;network topology;router (computing);simulation;tomography;traceroute;transistorâtransistor logic;tree network	Brian Eriksson;Gautam Dasarathy;Paul Barford;Robert D.

Specifically, we study how a client in the presence of measurement uncertainty can rapidly select a resource (target) that exhibits good network connectivity. The problem has many applications, including peer selection in P2P systems, server/gateway selection in IP telephony, and overlay routing. A probing-based search strategy is complicated by the potentially large number of targets and the inherent uncertainty in measurement results due to, for instance, small measurement sample sizes and other forms of """"noise."""" We parameterize the problem based on the number of available targets, the number of """"good"""" targets, and various network characteristics. We introduce a framework called spatial slow start (SSS) for searching the target space. SSS can be considered as a parameterized tree search with an interesting twist: apart from the target search space, the rate of probing per target is also manipulated at each step. A detailed simulation study provides insight on what SSS choices are significant under different network conditions. The simulation study also establishes that previously proposed techniques, namely, a random selection (RAND) algorithm that does not do any probing, and a """"quick probe and select the best"""" (QPS) technique work well, but only in some situations. Based on these insights, we present an adaptive SSS algorithm that not only guides the search process according to its measurements of various system parameters, but also changes its search parameters in response to the quality of the measurements themselves. This new adaptive SSS algorithm performs as well as RAND and QPS in situations where RAND and QPS are efficient, and outperforms them in other cases."""	algorithm;client (computing);distributed computing;quadratic programming;real-time clock;routing;server (computing);simulation;tcp congestion control;tree traversal	Bengi Karacali;Mark J.

End-to-end routing and forwarding algorithms are no longer the most effective way to retrieve contents when volatile replicas are highly spread at network routers. Requests sent only towards servers that permanently store contents do not account for the possibility to retrieve volatile replicas stored at neighbours caches. Mechanisms that explore the network in order to search nearby replicas stored in cache can improve users experience and reduce network load. This paper proposes the Diversity-based Search-and- Routing (DIVER) mechanism to jointly work with traditional end-to-end routing algorithms. DIVER probes the network to find volatile content replicas and routers answer those probes by compressing its cached contents availability information in a space efficient data structure. To maximize content retrieval, DIVER keeps as much orthogonal as possible the contents membership in its interfaces. Simulation results show that DIVER reduces up to 87% the network load and 29% the distance to find volatile replicas when compared to a literature proposal.	algorithm;best-effort delivery;cache (computing);data structure;end-to-end principle;network packet;programming paradigm;requests;router (computing);routing;simulation	Ian Vilar Bastos;Igor M.

With the rapid growth of the Internet, the emergence of many technologies such as service data partition, multi-connection and multi-path has made it possible to frequently exchange complex information between layers. With regard to these changes, this paper introduces ânetwork layered priority mapping (NLPM)â for future Internet development. The NLPM aims to maximize the satisfaction of the Internet users. The NLPM is designed to differentiate priority of the information on different layers and integrate the information using priority mapping. With NLPM, network services can be delivered more efficiently; network utilization such as the utilization of connection, path and channel can also be improved. Model analysis, NS simulation and prototype implementation have proved the efficiency of NLPM.	emergence;future internet;prototype;simulation	Dong Hee Yang;Hongke Zhang;Fei Song;Shiyong Li	2010	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-010-4047-0	computer science;distributed computing;world wide web;computer network	Networks	-10.06646691477757	84.70008633805364	157730

The overall problem is decomposed into three subproblems: (1) physical path allocation, (2) checking for violations of the special optical constraints on the allocated physical path, and (3) channel assignment. Only point to point connections are considered. The physical path allocation technique uses the K-shortest path algorithm and tries to minimize the number of sources potentially interfering with each other, as a result of the incoming call. A channel assignment heuristic that tends to spread out calls evenly among the available channels works better than one that tries to maximize channel reuse. >	lightwave 3d;routing	Krishna Bala;Thomas E.

The framework uses the concept of multilayer hypervisors for efficient resources allocation. It also introduces a semi-decentralized control scheme that allows the CRN Base Station BS to delegate some of the management responsibilities to the network users. The main objective of the proposed framework is to reduce the CR users' reliance on the CRN BS and physical network resources while improving the network performance by reducing the control overhead.	cognitive radio	Yaser Jararweh;Mahmoud Al-Ayyoub;Ahmad Doulat;Ahmad Al Abed Al Aziz;Haythem Bany Salameh;Abdallah Khreishah	2015	IJGHPC	10.4018/ijghpc.2015010102	cognitive radio;real-time computing;cognitive network;resource allocation;computer science;operating system;software-defined radio;distributed computing;software-defined networking;hypervisor;computer network	Mobile	-13.32464709534004	84.7802293402177	157903

A typical future data center can consist of up to hundreds of thousands of servers. Yet, the conventional data center networks are not able to keep up with the network bandwidth requirement for efficiently connecting that huge number of servers in a cost-efficient manner. In this paper, we present DPillar, a highly scalable data center interconnection architecture, which uses only low-end off-the-shelf commodity PC servers and switches. DPillar has minimal requirements for the equipment. The switches are low-cost plug-and-play layer-2 devices and servers are dual-port commodity PCs. The salient feature of DPillar is that it expands to any number of servers without requiring to physically upgrade the existing servers. We present simple yet efficient routing schemes for DPillar and evaluate the routing performance via simulations.	data center;dummy variable (statistics);interconnection;network architecture;network interface controller;network switch;requirement;routing;scalability;server (computing);simulation	Yong Liao;Dong Yin;Lixin Gao	2010	2010 Proceedings of 19th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks	10.1109/ICCCN.2010.5560132	data link layer;algorithm design;data center;routing;fault tolerance;real-time computing;computer science;data-intensive computing;distributed computing;server;computer network;cost efficiency	Visualization	-12.288833878296039	80.36437903741809	157974

However, most proposals provide only qualitative arguments for their improved support of flexibility. Quantitative arguments can quite vary among different proposals. A general understanding of flexibility is not yet clearly defined, leaving it to the reader to draw the right conclusions based on background information. The term flexibility is commonly defined as the ability to adapt to changes. For networks, flexibility would refer to the ability to adapt the available network resources, such as flows or topology, to changes of design requirements, e.g., shorter latency budgets or different traffic distributions. Recent concepts such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) have emerged to provide more flexibility in networks. Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of what flexibility means and how it could be quantified to compare different network designs remains open. In this paper, we propose a flexibility measure for network design space analysis and show its application. As it is quite challenging to formulate a flexibility measure that covers all network characteristics, we propose an initial set of flexibility aspects targeted to SDN and NFV. Moreover, we present the results of a detailed analysis of network function placement following either an SDN-based or an NFV-based approach. Our study reveals that in a logically centralized deployment scenario a mix of SDN and NFV provides the highest flexibility, with respect to our selected flexibility aspect.	centralized computing;data center;display lag;network function virtualization;network planning and design;requirement;software deployment;software-defined networking;transfer function	Wolfgang Kellerer;Arsany Basta;Andreas Blenk	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2016.7562114	computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-10.907699529039549	83.39229523451787	157988

This approach has guaranteed in the near past reasonably performance for many applications, but it implies a waste of energy that today is unsustainable. This paper proposes an autonomous measurement mechanism, named G-Router, to allow an access node in the Internet to align its power consumption to either the maximum capacity the user traffic requires, or the minimum available capacity in the network path between source and destination. Simulation results show that allowing access network nodes to adapt the switching and transmission resources to the minimum between the above values, the G-Router guarantees the maximum QoS while minimizing the energy consumption.	access network;align (company);autonomous robot;best-effort delivery;display resolution;internet access;provisioning;quality of service;router (computing);simulation	Alfio Lombardo;Carla Panarello;Giovanni Schembra	2010	SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review	10.1145/1925019.1925035	superposition principle;best-effort delivery;real-time computing;internet access;computer science;computer security;computer network;network access point;access network;network access device	Networks	-17.719661047337457	78.70246260376909	157992

We describe a mechanism that requires neither new or extended network/L3 and transport/L4 protocols nor changes of ICN host network stacks, and supports aggregation of routes inside the SDN controlled network. The proposed solution is agnostic of the specific ICN protocol in use, and does not require all network elements to be SDN-enabled. It supports advanced ICN routing features like request aggregation and forking, as well as load-balancing, traffic engineering, and explicit path steering (e. g., through ICN caches). We present the design as well as our first implementation of the proposed scheme-based on the Trema OpenFlow controller-framework and CCNx.	cpu cache;data center;fork (software development);icn gps;internet protocol suite;load balancing (computing);openflow;routing;software-defined networking	Markus Vahlenkamp;Fabian R N Schneider;Dirk Kutscher;Jan Seedorf	2013	2013 21st IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)	10.1109/ICNP.2013.6733634	real-time computing;computer science;ip forwarding;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-15.86673607110354	83.6045419365549	158740

d396cc7096809c3fcfae50737d990cd078890b2f	a globally optimised multipath routing algorithm using sdn		The Software Defined Network (SDN) model promises the delivery of a network architecture capable of handling the demands of current and future applications more efficiently than the current distributed network architecture. SDN gains this ability by moving to a logically centralised control plane. The centralised network controller has up to date information on both the network topology and the flows using the network. In this work we use the information already available at the network controller to create a globally optimised Per-Packet multipath routing algorithm. An optimal Per-Packet multipath routing algorithm may split a flow unequally between different paths. Current SDN capable hardware is not able to split flows in an unequal fashion while still remaining scalable. To overcome this limitation, we also propose a stochastic flow splitting mechanism capable of dividing a flow into any number of fractional components while offering better scalability than current methods. To analyse the performance of our proposed system, the GEANT network topology is used. Under heavy traffic load, our system shows a 90% improvement in a flow's received throughput when compared to OSPF and ECMP.	bounce address;buffer overflow;centralisation;certified computer examiner;computation;control plane;dijkstra's algorithm;endeavour software project management;equal-cost multi-path routing;multipath propagation;multipath routing;network architecture;network congestion;network interface controller;network packet;network performance;network switch;network topology;scalability;signal processing;software-defined networking;throughput	Noel Farrugia;Victor Buttigieg;Johann A.

c8631dabf42e9fc20190c5ad218c1f4fc40e14b6	minicamp: prototype for partial participation in structured peer-to-peer monitoring protocols		Quality of service and quality of experience are of increasingly interest for successful communication network applications, particularly for decentralized networks, such as peer-to-peer (p2p) networks. They need sophisticated monitoring mechanisms to be able to adapt the system's parameters to maintain a certain level of quality of service. In the literature, several well-studied approaches, classified as structured monitoring overlays, have been proposed. To the best known of the authors, these do not tackle the problem of partial participation. With Minicamp we propose a middleware which operates between the p2p overlay and the monitoring overlay and creates the opportunity to run monitoring services on just a subset of all nodes. These nodes gather and disseminate monitoring data of the whole system which is achieved by probing the subset of participating nodes. Evaluations reveal high precision for the probing scheme even when facing low participation rates.	best, worst and average case;middleware;participatory monitoring;peer-to-peer;prototype;quality of service;telecommunications network	Andreas DisterhÃ¶ft;Kalman Graffi	2017	2017 IEEE 42nd Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2017.58	quality of service;telecommunications network;computer network;peer-to-peer;quality of experience;computer science;distributed computing;dissemination;middleware;overlay	Metrics	-13.735970482806731	77.46176770452303	159488

To this end, software-defined networking (SDN) has been proposed as a promising solution. In the SDN architecture, the control plane and the data plane are decoupled, and the network infrastructures are abstracted and managed by a centralized controller. With SDN, efficient and flexible network control can be achieved, which potentially enhances network performance. To harvest the benefits of SDN in wireless networks, the software-defined wireless network (SDWN) architecture has been recently considered. In this paper, we first analyze the applications of SDN to different types of wireless networks. We then discuss several important technical aspects of performance enhancement in SDN-based wireless networks. Finally, we present possible future research directions of SDWN.	centralized computing;control plane;delay-tolerant networking;forwarding plane;graph coloring;internet access;network architecture;network performance;software-defined networking	Mingjie Feng;Shiwen Mao;Tao Jiang	2016	Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering	10.1631/FITEE.1500336	computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Networks	-13.994874511460692	85.42095728427581	159612

A multi-stage switch based on the shared per node wavelength conversion scheme is considered in a synchronous context. An analytical model is provided to calculate the packet loss probability in relation to different reference traffic scenarios. Results show how the sharing of wavelength converters impacts on node performance depending on the scheduling algorithm applied, and provide a meaningful support for optical packet switch design.	algorithm;blocking (computing);computational complexity theory;heuristic;network packet;network switch;packet switching;sandy bridge;scheduling (computing);sparse;switch statement	Carla Raffaelli;Michele Savi;Alexandros A.

The traditional approach of resource reservation and admission control provides both guarantees and graded services, however, at the cost of potentially underutilized resources and limited scalability. In this paper, we describe a WAN QoS provision architecture that adaptively organizes best-effort bandwidth into stratified services with graded QoS properties such that the QoS needs of a diverse user base can be effectively met. Our architectureâSBS (Stratified Best-effort Service)âpromotes a simple user/simple network realization where neither the user nor the network is burdened with complex computational responsibilities. SBS is scalable, efficient, and adaptive, and it complements the guaranteed service architecture, sharing a common network substrate comprised of GPS routers. It is also a functional complement, provisioning QoS efficiently commensurate with user needs, albeit at the cost of weaker protection. SBS is suited to noncooperative network environments where users behave selfishly and resource contention resolution is mediated by the principle of competitive interaction. A principal feature of SBS is the transformation of user-centric QoS provision mechanismsâa defining characteristic of competitive interaction entailing intimate user control of internal network resourcesâinto network-centric mechanisms while preserving the formerâs resource allocation paradigm. End-to-end QoS control is facilitated by decentralized control based on Lagrangian optimizationâachieve a target end-to-end QoS at minimum cost or resource usageâwhich, in turn, is amenable to distributed implementation. SBS achieves per-flow QoS control with zero per-flow state at routers and a packet header whose size is independent of hop count. SBS, in spite of foregoing both resource reservation and admission control, is able to provision stable, graded QoS.	best-effort delivery;computation;differentiated services;distributed control system;end-to-end principle;global positioning system;intranet;mathematical optimization;network packet;programming paradigm;provisioning;quality of service;requirement;resource contention;router (computing);scalability;smart battery system;user interface	Shaogang Chen;Kihong Park	1999		10.1109/INFCOM.1999.751475	best-effort delivery;real-time computing;mobile qos;quality of service;differentiated service;decentralised system;computer science;distributed computing;packet switching;computer network	Networks	-15.56001301821647	79.90357558852784	159859

In fact, in today s energy conscious society, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) account for 2 percent of global CO2 emissions. To place this in perspective, a medium sized cellular network uses as much as 170,000 homes. Therefore, new solutions are required whereby operators can accommodate this additional traffic volume whilst reducing their investments in new infrastructure and beyond that significantly reducing their energy bill.

79623899f8b09f1e9e4ab3d1e26be08f765dd389	s2vc: an sdn-based framework for maximizing qoe in svc-based http adaptive streaming		Abstract HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) is quickly becoming the dominant video delivery technique for adaptive streaming over the Internet. Still considered as its primary challenges are determining the optimal rate adaptation and improving both the quality of experience (QoE) and QoE-fairness. Most of the proposed approaches have relied on local information to find a result. However, employing techniques that provide a comprehensive and central view of the network resources can lead to more gains in performance. By leveraging software defined networking (SDN), this paper proposes an SDN-based framework, named S 2 VC , to maximize QoE metrics and QoE-fairness in SVC-based HTTP adaptive streaming. The proposed framework determines both the optimal adaptation and data paths for delivering the requested video files from HTTP-media servers to DASH clients. In fact, by utilizing an SDN controller and its complete view of the network, we introduce an SVC flow optimizer (SFO) application module to determine the optimal solution in a centralized and time slot fashion. In the current approach, we first formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model. The MILP is designed in such a way that it applies defined policies, e.g. setting priorities for clients in obtaining video quality. Secondly, we show that this problem is NP-complete and propose an LP-relaxation model to enable S 2 VC framework for performing rate adaptation on a large-scale network. Finally, we conduct experiments by emulating the proposed framework in Mininet, with the usage of Floodlight as the SDN controller. In terms of improving QoE-fairness and QoE metrics, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by a comparison with different approaches.	centralized computing;dynamic adaptive streaming over http;emulator;experiment;fairness measure;hypertext transfer protocol;integer programming;internet;karp's 21 np-complete problems;lp-type problem;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;media server;multicast;np-completeness;network packet;network switch;openflow;performance evaluation;programming paradigm;python;scalable video coding;server (computing);software-defined networking;streaming media;video file format	Farzad Tashtarian;Alireza R.

Due to the large size and dynamic nature of these systems, measuring the quantities of interest on every peer is often prohibitively expensive, while sampling provides a natural means for estimating system-wide behavior efficiently. However, commonly-used sampling techniques for measuring peer-to-peer systems tend to introduce considerable bias for two reasons. First, the dynamic nature of peers can bias results towards short-lived peers, much as naively sampling flows in a router can lead to bias towards short-lived flows. Second, the heterogeneous nature of the overlay topology can lead to bias towards high-degree peers.We present a detailed examination of the ways that the behavior of peer-to-peer systems can introduce bias and suggest the  Metropolized Random Walk with Backtracking (MRWB) as a viable and promising technique for collecting nearly unbiased samples. We conduct an extensive simulation study to demonstrate that the proposed technique works well for a wide variety of common peer-to-peer network conditions. Using the Gnutella network, we empirically show that our implementation of the MRWB technique yields more accurate samples than relying on commonly-used sampling techniques. Furthermore, we provide insights into the causes of the observed differences. The tool we have developed, ion-sampler, selects peer addresses uniformly at random using the MRWB technique. These addresses may then be used as input to another measurement tool to collect data on a particular property.	backtracking;gnutella;peer-to-peer;router (computing);sampling (signal processing);simulation	Daniel Stutzbach;Reza Rejaie;Nick G.

One of the most prominent examples is the TCP transport protocol, which performs only poorly in wireless ad-hoc networks. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay networks recently developed all target the Internet where a lot of performance issues can be neglected or can be completely ignored. In addition, assumptions made for infrastructure based networks cannot be made in an ad-hoc environment, such as a fixed set of nodes which are always available. This article presents a P2P network tailored towards mobile ad-hoc environments. It utilizes proximity information to efficiently generate an overlay structure which reflects the underlying physical network topology. This way, physical routing path lengths stretched by the overlay routing process are reduced. As a novelty it does not rely on a fixed set of nodes and adapts to changes in the physical network topology. A prominent property of the overlay construction process is that the communication overhead is reduced to a minimum. Additionally, the P2P network presented maintains an even Overlay ID distribution which is deliberately given up by some solutions previously developed for wired networks. The basis of this new overlay network is Pastry, a P2P substrate based on the concept of a distributed hash table. Two different bootstrap strategies were developed and analyzed, both explicitly designed to work in dynamic and mobile networks such as ad-hoc networks.	hoc (programming language);overlay network;peer-to-peer	Rolf Winter;Thomas Zahn;Jochen H.

However, limiting the offered services to only an onboard Internet is not a feasible business case. A viable one should extend to a broad spectrum of railway communication services like: train control, diagnostics, real time passenger information, entertainment, security CCTV surveillance etc. In a highly dynamic environment (from the communication link point of view) such a fast moving train, it is necessary to introduce prioritization among different traffic classes. This will implicitly determine under what conditions a certain flow should get suspended or dropped in order to preserve the flows of a higher priority as long as possible and to ensure that they meet their QoS demands. The first step towards this goal is data traffic differentiation.	best-effort delivery;closed-circuit television;end-to-end principle;internet;network traffic control;noise shaping;quality of service;seamless3d;streaming media;web traffic	Milos Rovcanin;Dries Naudts;Daan Pareit;Ingrid Moerman;Johan Bergs;Erwin Van de Velde;Chris Blondia	2012	2012 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2012.6398997	the internet;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;ipv6;computer security;computer network	Embedded	-13.97344584767189	87.49140194105347	160576

DiffServ cannot offer end-to-end QoS by itself, because it controls per-hop packet forwarding order with relative priority according to its class. Achieving end-to-end QoS requires traffic engineering support by using MPLS and ConstraintBased Routing (CBR) schemes in addition to DiffServ. CBR schemes compute explicit routes for Label-Switched Paths (LSPs), which specify packet forwarding routes in MPLS networks. In this paper, we assume two DiffServ classes: Expedited Forwarding (EF) class which corresponds to voice traffic requiring small path delay, and Best Effort (BE) class which corresponds to data traffic requiring high throughput. Four DiffServ-aware CBR schemes are constructed, based on a combination of route computation algorithms and LSP-types depending on whether or not DiffServ classes are considered. In addition to the schemes, we propose a DiffServ-aware CBR scheme that uses a different route computation algorithm for each class. By simulating path accommodations for two-class traffic between every node pair, we evaluate QoS achieved by the five DiffServ-aware CBR schemes. The results show that the proposed scheme can offer better QoS for each class. q 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Various explicit routing TE methods were recently proposed and have been able to achieve high network performance. However, explicit routing has high complexity and requires large ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) in the routers. Moreover, it is costly to deploy explicit routing in IP networks. In this paper, we present an approach, called generalized destination-based multipath routing (GDMR), to achieve the same high performance as explicit routing. The main contribution of this paper is that we prove that an arbitrary explicit routing can be converted to a loop-free destination-based routing without any performance penalty for a given traffic matrix. We present a systematic approach including a heuristic algorithm to realize GDMR. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of GDMR.	algorithm;content-addressable memory;heuristic (computer science);load balancing (computing);multipath routing;network performance;test engineer	Junjie Zhang;Kang Xi;H.

2dde6d61ff3cd3c15056b41c75f512e63cc9a625	orbis: rescaling degree correlations to generate annotated internet topologies	network topology;graph matching;internet topology	Researchers involved in designing network services and protocols rely on results from simulation and emulation environments to understand their application performance and scalability. To better understand the behavior of these applications and predict their performance when deployed on the actual Internet, the generated topologies must closely match real network characteristics, not just in terms of graph structure (node interconnectivity) but also with respect to various node and link annotations. Relevant annotations include link latencies, AS membership and whether a router is a peering or internal router. Finally, it should be possible to rescale a given topology to a variety of sizes while still maintaining its essential characteristics.  In this paper, we propose techniques to generate annotated, Internet router graphs of different sizes based on existing observations of Internet characteristics. We find that our generated graphs match a variety of graph properties of observed topologies for a range of target graph sizes. While the best available data of Internet topology currently remains imperfect, the quality of our generated topologies will improve with the fidelity of available measurement techniques or next generation architectures that make Internet structure more transparent.	emulator;graph property;internet topology;next-generation network;peering;router (computing);scalability;simulation	Priya Mahadevan;Calvin Hubble;Dmitri V.

2c91aa68564053f5aeedabfc372ff48dc50f7130	switching techniques		This section introduces basic switching techniques used within the routers of multiprocessor interconnection networks. Switching techniques determine when and how messages are forwarded through the network. These techniques determine the granularity and timing with which resources such as buffers and switch ports are requested and released and consequently determine the blocking behavior of routing protocols that utilize them in different network topologies. As a result, they are key determinants of the deadlock properties of routing protocols. Further, their relationship to flow control protocols and traffic characteristics significantly impact the latency and bandwidth characteristics of the network.	blocking (computing);deadlock;flow control (data);interconnection;multiprocessing;network topology;routing	Sudhakar Yalamanchili	2011		10.1007/978-0-387-09766-4_296		Metrics	-4.8753046964357845	87.5166377899776	161503

In this work we assume that the P2P multicasting is used to distribute content with high reliability requirements, e.g., weather warnings, security updates, financial data, security warnings, etc. The main idea to provide protection of the system against network failures is to establish several (at least two) disjoint multicasting trees. Our discussion in this paper centers on the problem how additional survivability constraints to provide failure-disjoint trees impact the operation of P2P multicasting systems. As the performance metrics we propose to use: streaming cost, maximum delay and throughput. The possible failure scenario we take into account is a single failure of one of the following network elements: streaming server, overlay link, uploading node and ISP link. We examine the topic of survivable P2P multicasting applying offline optimization methods and simulations. In the former case we formulate Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) models and use the CPLEX solver to obtain optimal results. For the streaming cost objective we compare two MIP formulations in terms of the complexity and execution time. Results show that our formulation provides much better performance compared to the classical P2P multicasting formulation proposed in the literature. Moreover, in the case of the streaming cost problem we propose a new evolutionary algorithm that yields results for larger networks than the CPLEX solver. The simulations are run to emulate a distributed network environment, in which each node makes its own decisions. Results obtained using both research methods confirm that the survivability of P2P multicasting can be achieved with relatively low additional system overhead for all three considered performance metrics: streaming cost, maximum delay and system throughput.	mathematical optimization;multicast	Krzysztof Walkowiak;Michal Przewozniczek	2011	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2010.12.011	time complexity;real-time computing;multicast;simulation;metric;telecommunications;news;computer science;evolutionary algorithm;reliability;overlay	DB	-4.736159902366467	77.87186603816703	161582

We improve the Max-RWA model presented by R. M. Krishnaswamy and K. N. Sivarajan (see ibid., vol.5, p.435-7, Oct. 2001) by introducing limited-range wavelength conversions. Considering transmission performance, we propose a new optimization objective, which is to establish the maximum number of connections with the least number of wavelength converters. The modified Max-RWA problem is formulated as a integer linear programming (ILP) problem, and then solved using a genetic algorithm. The extended layered-graph approach is used to assign routes and wavelengths when necessary, thus reducing the complexity of the genetic algorithm. Numerical results obtained for NSFNET are presented.	assignment problem;genetic algorithm;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;national science foundation network;numerical method;routing and wavelength assignment	Hao Qin;Zengji Liu;Shi Zhang;Aijun Wen	2002	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2002.804249	mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;mathematics	Theory	-4.927294474922289	81.09822780933128	161870

Because of the difficulties of this problem, approximate solutions such as probabilistic searches have long been studied. However, the real-world network topologies seem to be more type oriented than the above traditional computer based solutions. In fact, most real network topologies consist of a hierarchical combination of basic types such as the bus, the star, and the ring to avoid the difficulties of the design problem. In this paper, a new parametric method for localized spanning tree (ST) generation is proposed with good experimental results. The method performs node clustering and physical link generation in one step. This is realized by a new idea of the parameterized virtual node distance incorporating both the physical node distance and the traffic gravity between nodes with a parametric weight. A set of localized spanning trees can be generated on traditional Kruscal algorithm, by changing the weight. As the main computational costs are the MST generation and the depth-first shortest-route search, so this is a high-speed approximate solver of the network topology design problem. To assist selecting a good solution, a link capacity determination function to achieve the given mean delay time and the monthly cost estimation function are incorporated. Approximate mathematical discussions to prove the existence of a minimum cost solution in the generated candidates is given.	approximation algorithm;cluster analysis;computation;depth-first search;file spanning;network planning and design;network topology;solver;spanning tree	Kazuaki Ova;Toshinori Watanabe;Hisashi Koga	2016	2016 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2016.7427110	frequency modulation;mathematical optimization;computer science;distributed computing;cluster analysis;information system;network topology;computer network	EDA	-7.375819119949837	78.98235888488357	161883

MPNT has been then improved by implementing multimedia access (mainly RTP, RTCP and SIP). MPNT original topology is spanning tree based. It is the most efficient topology in terms of switching delay (no routing) but the global delay variance can be important. To remedy this, we implemented an alternate hypercube- based topology. Indeed, hypercubes have several interesting properties - mainly compactness - that ensure a better scalability. Nevertheless, this logical hypercube optimization is valid provided that interconnecting links are comparable. To adapt the architecture to the network hetero- geneity, we implemented thus a hybrid topology exploiting both spanning tree and hypercube advantages.	multicast	RÃ©douane Benaini;Karim Sbata;Pierre Vincent	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30197-4_38	scalability;spanning tree;telecommunications;computer science;access control;distributed computing;computer security;hypercube;computer network;systems architecture;logical topology	Networks	-4.623350435615575	76.4574580685329	161884

Therefore, the identifier-locator split mapping network which separates the two functions has become one of the federating themes for future Internet architecture. However, DDoS attacks are still in existence in this network. In this paper, we use the attack traffic to discuss and compare the effects of DDoS attacks on the current Internet and the identifier-locator split mapping network. The numerical and simulation analyses show that the identifier-locator split mapping network alleviates DDoS attacks more effectively compared with the current Internet.	denial-of-service attack;future internet;identifier;network architecture;numerical analysis;online locator service;simulation	Ying Liu;Jianqiang Tang;Meng Zhang;Hongke Zhang	2013	J.

It is obvious that unicasting will not be adequate for such content distribution due to the unacceptable stress imposed on network resources. Multicasting is a solution to this problem, and thus multicast routing and group management are now receiving high attention. However, so far, conditions on the composition of multicast groups have been kept rather simple. Requirements on group membership, member roles and group organization, commonly referred to as group integrity conditions, are rarely addressed or even enforced. Furthermore, the traditional multicasting model has been flat, with no finer granularity than a group, lacking any inter-group relationships. In our work, we address both issues that we see as shortcomings of current models. Our framework allows us to subdivide multicast groups into subgroups (e.g. for high and low quality versions of a media stream) and to form and manage meta groups from groups, integrating inter-related """"multi"""" media groups. On all three levels, we specify a variety of integrity conditions as part of our comprehensive policy framework, including integrity on state and state transition, as well as group management action and transition policies."""	centralized computing;digital distribution;fault tolerance;future internet;interactive media;multicast;peering;requirement;routing;state transition table;tree-meta;unicast	Andreas Meissner;Lars C.

This usually leads to large amount of waste resources and unnecessary budget. To make a smart decision on the action plan, it is necessary to evaluate the relationship of the current hardware and the required quality of service (QOS). However, although many complex models have been introduced into the research field of high performance network QOS evaluation, it is hard for such method to be applied into production environment because of the random and complex characters of the network traffic and because of the heavy calculation tasks required by the models.The Threshold-crossing Theory based Education Network Traffic Control Method put forward in this paper is able to determine the necessary Education network traffic that have to be handled based on the Education network traffic data in production environment. Therefore, this method is helpful for designing, maintaining and upgrading network equipment and provide basis for reducing resource waste, avoiding unnecessary investment and optimizing resources.	deployment environment;network packet;network performance;network traffic control;performance evaluation;quality of service	Xia Tian	2009	2009 International Conference on Education Technology and Computer	10.1109/ICETC.2009.40	network planning and design;network traffic control;simulation;quality of service;investment;computer science;network simulation;computer network	HPC	-9.056314150738872	86.69257487896158	162058

This reflects a sustained growth rate over three decades of more than 80% per year, during continuous service. In system growth, the Internet has been matched only by the major infrastructure projects of the early 1900s: the electric power grid, the automobile, and the telephone network. The Internetâs scalability is the result of the single-minded focus of its designers on robustness and adaptability. Over the past three decades, the Internet has added support for automatic name translation, hierarchical routing, congestion avoidance, dynamic address assignment, multicast, mobility, and most recently, attempts at real-time support. Future Internet challenges will require continued evolution. For example, consider the fact that four billion microprocessors were fabricated in 1997. In the future, many of these embedded microprocessors will be Internet-connected, requiring the Internet to continue its rapid scaling well into the future. Unfortunately, although its design has focused overridingly on robustness, for all practical purposes the Internet is the largest performance and availability bottleneck today for end-to-end applications. Indeed, it is possible to build highly available end servers using networks of workstations (NOWs) and redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAIDs). However, as anyone who has used the Web knows, the path to a server can be very slow or often completely unavailable. The result is lost productivity while users wait for Web documents to be transmitted over the network. The Internetâs scale, heterogeneity, and dynamic nature make it difficult to determine the exact causes of Internet performance problems. However, it is clear that several of the assumptions made during the design of the Internet protocols have less validity today than they did in the early 1980sâsee the box, âThe evolving Internet.â In this article, we describe inefficiencies in routing and transport protocols in the modern Internet. We also attempt to quantify these effects. Although our results are preliminary, they suggest that there is considerable room for improvement through intelligent routing and congestion control. We are constructing a prototype, called Detour, to investigate these ideas and to gain experience with potential solutions. Detour is a virtual Internet, in which routers âtunnelâ packets over the commodity Internet instead of using dedicated links.

One of their most important attributes is availability that determines the need for research in this area. In the past, dozens of publications focused on the availability of cloud services. However, some of them provide only qualitative consideration, others do not consider whole infrastructure of cloud services from end to end. This paper clarifies the definition of service availability and gives quantitative evaluation of end-to-end availability of cloud services for typical situations taking into account all components of the service infrastructure. It shows that achieving high availability requires redundancy for such components as network connections and data centers.	cloud computing;data center;end-to-end principle;high availability;platform as a service	Victor Netes	2018	2018 22nd Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT)	10.23919/FRUCT.2018.8468272	redundancy (engineering);computer network;high availability;cloud computing;end-to-end principle;business	HPC	-15.907571437629246	85.81131429573026	162190

In previous work [18], we have proposed HOPE, an effective congestion control scheme, in the 3-stage Clos Network on Chip (NOC). HOPE proactively regulates traffic destined for each output by estimating the number of their backlogged packets in the network and applying a simple stop-and-go mechanism to prevent hotspot traffic from jamming the internal links between the stages. The effectiveness of HOPE in NOC has motivated us to apply it in the multistage buffered switches. Different from an NOC, where Switch Modules (SMs) are all on the single chip, the SMs in a multi-stage buffered switch are separated from each other for a distance up to 100 m. This significantly increases the hardware complexity of HOPE. In this paper, we address the implementation challenges when applying HOPE in the 3-stage Clos network switch. In particular, we propose a scalable traffic measurement mechanism to approximate the backlogged traffic for each output port by taking advantage of the property of Clos network that traffic is evenly distributed among central SMs. We also design an efficient messaging system to notify input sources upon congestion status updates. Simulation results with different traffic patterns show that HOPE can isolate hotspot traffic from non-hotspot traffic, achieve max-min fairness among different traffic types, and provide low latency for non-hotspot traffic and high throughput for hotspot traffic.	approximation algorithm;clos network;elegant degradation;fairness measure;hope (programming language);inter-process communication;internal link;java hotspot virtual machine;max-min fairness;multistage amplifier;multistage interconnection networks;network congestion;network on a chip;network switch;radio jamming;scalability;simulation;throughput	Najla Alfaraj;Yang Xu;H.

fdc9c8955c2fbfecca85b6057a725cbf6f228418	popularity-based caching for iptv services over p2p networks	video streaming;caching;content distribution networks;p2p networks;iptv	This study suggests to use popularity based caching for IP-based TV (IPTV) services over peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Each peer in a P2P network can use two levels of cache hierarchy: an internal cache and a neighboring peer cache. Using this property, our main focus is on caching the globally most popular video files nearby the clients, in order to reduce the IPTV service delay, increase the quality of service provided to the clients, and reduce the traffic over the Internet backbone. The proposed framework was applied on real data traces from live P2P networks. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over the Least Recently Used (LRU) and the Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache management schemes. This study is motivated by the vision of large P2P networks consisting of many volunteers serving as peers, each of which has a relatively small cache size, in terms of the number of video items it can store. Since the performance of both the LRU and LFU schemes is very poor for small cache, there is a need for another cache management scheme, which outperforms these schemes, especially for small cache size. The proposed distributed popularity-based caching scheme can significantly increase the performance of P2P networks used for video streaming, with respect to the existing networks, that use the LRU or LFU schemes. The performance metric used for comparison is the cache hit ratio and the expected delay for content delivery. In both parameters a significant improvement is demonstrated.	cache (computing);iptv;peer-to-peer	Sajal K.

The split-merge operation can be placed on any rectangular path to improve the transmission success ratio, dynamically adapting the route according to the current link condition, and thus overcoming the inflexibility of the fixed schedule. Based on the observation that almost every link is used in the sensor-to-controller route and the corresponding slot schedule, the proposed scheme gives precedence to the nodes having a high error level. The node error level can be calculated by averaging the error rate of all links emanating from the node. The performance evaluation result measured by extensive simulation using a discrete event scheduler demonstrates that with 75% split-merge operations, we can achieve over 90% success ratio when the grid dimension is 5, compared with full allocation.

235a768f9bcb8f3ad96f5b6e9ca4170e6716ba47	an innovative software-defined winemo architecture for advanced qos-guaranteed mobile service transport	software defined networking;quality of experience;mobility management;load balancing;quality of service	The spread of wireless networks and the growing proliferation of mobile devices require the development of new mobility control mechanisms to support the different demands of traffic in different network conditions. A major obstacle to developing this kind of technology refers to the complexity involved in handling all the information about the large number of Moving Objects (MOs), as well as the total signaling overhead required to manage these procedures in the network. Several initiatives proposed by the scientific community to address this issue reveal weakness, particularly by relying on the MO for the responsibility in triggering the mobility process. Moreover, they are often only guided by wireless medium statistics, such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of the candidate Point of Attachment (PoA). Thus, this work seeks to develop, evaluate and validate a high-level communication infrastructure for Wireless Networking for Moving Objects (WiNeMO) systems by making use of the flexibility provided by the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm, where network functions are easily and efficiently deployed by integrating OpenFlow and IEEE 802.21 standards. The Software-Defined WiNeMO (SDWiNeMO) holistic framework is largely aimed at enabling the network infrastructure to provision service transport while guaranteeing Quality of Service (QoS) for multiple mobile applications, as well as providing seamless mobility for MOs always seeking the best connectivity to maintain good Quality of Experience (QoE) over time. Moreover, SDWiNeMO deploys a new mobility-based load balancing technique to increase MO admissions for situations involving PoA resource saturation. The feasibility and effectiveness of our proposal is assessed by prototyping and evaluating the SDWiNeMO architecture in a baseline two-part hybrid testbed comprising realistic networking conditions. For purposes of benchmarking, the analysis was conducted in the control and data plane aspects, which demonstrate that the SDWiNeMO proposal significantly outperforms typical QoS-capable Internet Protocol (IP)-based SDN configurations by allowing the network to handle the multimedia traffic with optimal QoS-guaranteed transport and acceptable QoE over time.	attachments;baseline (configuration management);control function (econometrics);control plane;control system;expectationâmaximization algorithm;experiment;forwarding plane;high- and low-level;holism;load balancing (computing);mobile app;mobile device;openflow;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;provisioning;quality of service;smart;scalability;seamless3d;self-organization;software-defined networking;testbed;usc interactive media & games division	Felipe Sampaio Dantas da Silva;Augusto Neto;Douglas Braz Maciel;JosÃ© Castillo Lema;FlÃ¡vio Oliveira Silva;Pedro Frosi Rosa;Eduardo Cerqueira	2016	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2016.04.019	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;load balancing;operating system;software-defined networking;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-14.193945436404423	86.28170144371764	162450

Even though content-oriented networking, which tries to resolve this discordance, has received increasing attention, there have been few comprehensive and quantitative studies on how to realize a content-oriented networking architecture. In this paper, we focus on the design alternatives of the content-oriented networking architecture and evaluate their performance: (i) how to locate contents, (ii) how to cache contents, and (iii) how to deliver contents. There are two major infrastructure alternatives in substantiating these mechanisms: a tree and a distributed hash table (DHT).We carry out comprehensive simulation experiments to compare these alternatives in terms of content transfer latency, cache effectiveness, and failure resilience.	distributed hash table;experiment;simulation	Jaeyoung Choi;Jinyoung Han;Eunsang Cho;Hyunchul Kim;Taekyoung Kwon;Yanghee Choi	2009	2009 IEEE 34th Conference on Local Computer Networks	10.1109/LCN.2009.5355081	routing;scalability;the internet;network architecture;index term;name resolution;computer science;chord;operating system;distributed computing;world wide web;network topology;computer network	Metrics	-14.043843244586812	76.20826371681851	162542

Our framework is designed to easily implement and measure different P2P protocols over different transport layers such as TCP or UDP. This paper discusses our implementation of the Symphony network, which allows each node to keep k â¤ log N shortcut connections and to route to any other node with a short average delay of O( 1 k log N). We present experimental results taken from several PlanetLab deployments of size up to 1060 nodes.

e84f3f3615b29a5bad142d656cd5d7572911f38c	link-based parameterized micro-tolling scheme for optimal traffic management		In the micro-tolling paradigm, different toll values are assigned to different links within a congestible traffic network. Self-interested agents then select minimal cost routes, where cost is a function of the travel time and tolls paid. A centralized system manager sets toll values with the objective of inducing a user equilibrium that maximizes the total utility over all agents. A recently proposed algorithm for computing such tolls, denoted â-tolling, was shown to yield up to 32% reduction in total travel time in simulated traffic scenarios compared to when there are no tolls. â-tolling includes two global parameters: Î² which is a proportionality parameter, and R which influences the rate of change of toll values across all links. This paper introduces a generalization of â-tolling which accounts for different Î² and R values on each link in the network. While this enhanced â-tolling algorithm requires setting significantly more parameters, we show that they can be tuned effectively via policy gradient reinforcement learning. Experimental results from several traffic scenarios indicate that Enhanced â-tolling reduces total travel time by up to 28% compared to the original â-tolling algorithm, and by up to 45% compared to not tolling.	algorithm;centralized computing;gradient;programming paradigm;reinforcement learning;system manager (hp lx)	Hamid Mirzaei;Guni Sharon;Stephen D.

Virtual network operators specify multiple priority classes in order to satisfy different latency requirements for their inter-cloud network services with a variety of delay-sensitivities on their virtual networks. Furthermore, they may require substrate resource sharing among multiple priority classes in order to reduce the amount of substrate resources assigned to them. Meanwhile, it is desirable for a substrate network provider that multiple virtual networks can share substrate resources since the total amount of substrate resources required can be reduced due to the effect of statistical multiplexing. This paper formulates a novel virtual network embedding problem and proposes a heuristic virtual network embedding method to minimize the total substrate resources required when the virtual network operators request substrate resource sharing among multiple priority classes within their virtual networks. Based on the proposed method, multiple virtual networks can maximally share substrate resources with one another while sharing substrate resources on an equal basis. The effect of substrate resource sharing among multiple priority classes and multiple virtual networks is quantitatively assessed through extensive simulations, and advantageous topologies for requested virtual networks and substrate networks are also presented.

As these algorithms operate at multiple layers of the communications architecture, evaluation of such techniques must take into account a variety of scenarios, which are in turn parameterized by a large number of variables. The need to monitor algorithm behavior in real time results in a data explosion. In this work, we propose new real-time metrics to characterize and identify the critical states of a mobile network in the wake of channel failures, congestion, signal degradation, etc. We use these metrics to define a survivability index, a measure of mobile network performance in the wake of failures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of information visualization techniques in understanding the complex spatial and temporal relationships between performance and cost metrics that influence adaptive algorithms. Our visualization system is highly scalable and interactive, permitting multiple algorithms to be simultaneously evaluated. We demonstrate applications to network monitoring and to the design and evaluation of adaptive admission control algorithms.	algorithm;elegant degradation;information visualization;network congestion;network performance;quality of service;real-time clock;scalability	T.

5a3dbf82a1707754909618423a80f143eb7dadb9	tree delta transcoding for efficient dynamic resource delivery on asymmetric internet		The paper presents a scheme for serving dynamic resources over the Internet. The method uses a combination of structured fragmentation of dynamic resources in a tree hierarchy and update messaging in the form of difference between the trees called the Tree Deltas. The proposed method reduces the impact of dynamic documents on network bandwidth, and shortens the response time. The system has been designed for an Active network like concept architecture where Tree Delta Transcoders (TDT) can be deployed and activated dynamically at the (active) network junction points. The system will be especially useful near the most difficult bandwidth constrained periphery of the Internet. As we shall see the analysis and results show that the proposed TDT communication can be an effective tool in surmounting the growing problem of asymmetry in the Internet in general, and in particular, can directly help in splicing wireless device networks with the commodity internet.	active networking;fragmentation (computing);internet;response time (technology);time-domain reflectometry	Javed I.

Network Virtualization (NV) is expected to overcome the ossification of today's communication networks. SDN is seen as an enabler for programmable network control. In order to fully virtualize software-defined networks, not only the virtualization of the data-plane, but also the virtualization of the control-plane has to be considered. HyperFlex is a virtualization hypervisor that ensures isolated control-plane slices for virtual SDN networks. Control-plane isolation also protects the hypervisor resources from exhaustion. Furthermore, virtualization hypervisors have to be scalable and flexible in order to provide the best possible performance for the virtual software-defined networks. They should be able to adapt to the current state of the network and the divergent demands of virtual SDN networks. HyperFlex distributes the hypervisor functions flexibly and dynamically in order to adapt to the current network state.	forwarding plane;hypervisor;nv network;scalability;software-defined networking;telecommunications network;virtualize	Arsany Basta;Andreas Blenk;Yu-Ting Lai;Wolfgang Kellerer	2015	2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)	10.1109/INM.2015.7140460	embedded system;full virtualization;virtualization;thin provisioning;storage hypervisor;application virtualization;computer science;virtual machine;data virtualization;resource management;operating system;hardware virtualization;overlay transport virtualization;page table;service virtualization;hypervisor;storage virtualization;server;computer network	Arch	-14.971761753037576	82.50427006263595	163628

In order to achieve this, ICN is based on the paradigm of publish-subscribe and the concepts of naming and in-network caching. Current approaches to ICN employ caches within networks to minimize the latency of information retrieval. Content may be distributed either in caches along the delivery path(s), on-path caching or in any cache within a network, off-path caching. While approaches to off-path caching are comparable to traditional approaches for content replication and Web caching, approaches to on-path caching are specific to the ICN area. The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the caching problem in ICN, with a focus on on-path caching. To this end, a detailed analysis of the existing caching policies and forwarding mechanisms that complement these policies is given. A number of criteria such as the caching model and level of operation and the evaluation parameters used in the evaluation of the existing caching policies are being employed to derive a taxonomy for on-path caching and highlight the trends and evaluation issues in this area. A discussion driven by the advantages and disadvantages of the existing caching policies and the challenges and open questions in on-path caching is finally being held.	icn gps;information retrieval;internet;programming paradigm;publishâsubscribe pattern;web cache	Andriana Ioannou;Stefan Hagen Weber	2016	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/COMST.2016.2565541	communications protocol;routing;the internet;false sharing;computer science;distributed computing;publishâsubscribe pattern;world wide web;server;computer network	Metrics	-14.213006375330696	76.28772642347649	163700

Software Defined networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that provides flexibility to Datacenter network design. In this paper, a framework is presented to enhance security in SDN-based datacenters. SDN features are leveraged to integrate network layer with security middleboxes such as intrusion prevention system (IPS) or Firewall (FW) to block attackers at the network edge. A proof of concept is designed and implemented using Citrix Xenservers and Mininet emulation software where a typical datacenter fat-tree topology is adopted. Performance evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides an adaptive self-defending network able to protect running services and defend against internal threats while reducing attack response time.	bring your own device;data center;denial-of-service attack;emulator;fat tree;firewall (computing);intrusion detection system;network access control;network planning and design;performance evaluation;programming paradigm;requirement;response time (technology);scalability;software-defined networking;throughput;tree network	Moustafa Ammar;Mohamed Rizk;Ayman Abdel-Hamid;Ahmed K.

2b27fe845cdd52b250368ae41cbdc2d235b6aff6	bridging the gap between applications and networks in data centers	data center	Modern data centers host tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of servers and are used by companies such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft to provide online services to millions of individuals distributed across the Internet. They use commodity hardware and their network infrastructure adopts principles evolved from enterprise and Internet networking. Applications use UDP datagrams or TCP sockets as the primary interface to other applications running inside the data center. This effectively isolates the network from the end-systems, which then have little control over how the network handles packets. Likewise, the network has limited visibility on the application logic. An application injects a packet with a destination address and the network just delivers the packet. Network and applications effectively treat each other as black-boxes. This strict separation between applications and networks (also referred to as dumb network) is a direct outcome of the so-called end-to-end argument [49] and has arguably been one of the main reasons why the Internet has been capable of evolving from a small research project to planetary scale, supporting a multitude of different hardware and network technologies as well as a slew of very diverse applications, and using networks owned by competing ISPs. Despite being so instrumental in the success of the Internet, this black-box design is also one of the root causes of inefficiencies in large-scale data centers. Given the little control and visibility over network resources, applications need to use low-level hacks, e.g., to extract network properties (e.g., using traceroute and IP addresses to infer the network topology) and to prioritize traffic (e.g., increasing the number of TCP flows used by an application to increase its bandwidth share). Further, a simple functionality like multicast or anycast routing is not available and developers must resort to application-level overlays. This, however, leads to inefficiencies as typically multiple logical links are mapped to the same physical link, significantly reducing application throughput.

The proposed mechanism is based on efficient collaboration between several entities called PCEs (Path Computation Elements). One PCE is designated at each domain. All PCEs should communicate in order to ensure suitable End-to-End(E2E) failure handling, recovery and restoration. Based on normative instructions described in the RFC 5298 and the Backward Recursive PCE-based Computation approach (BRPC) presented in RFC 5441, the new mechanism offers an opportunity to achieve E2E recovery using up-to-date information and giving a way to maintain correct network states with respect to intra-domain as well as inter-domain contexts, without care of heterogeneity and autonomy of crossed areas. Simulation results prove that, compared to existing E2E protection and on-demand backup path recovery mechanisms, the proposed solution is able to support, more efficiently, inter-domain recovery regardless of per-domains policies and rules, by ensuring lower recovery time, improved resources management and low packet loss/disorder bounds.	backup;care-of address;circuit restoration;computation;entity;inter-domain;multiprotocol label switching;network packet;performance;recursion (computer science);reliability engineering;scalability;simulation	Ali El Kamel;Habib Youssef	2012	2012 20th Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-based Processing	10.1109/PDP.2012.93	multiprotocol label switching;parallel computing;real-time computing;logic gate;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;computer network	DB	-8.040329431484752	82.84806510731501	163997

In a multi-star network, however, we d o not have the same degree of freedom for reconfiguration because we are not free to exchange the logical identities of an arbitrary pair of nodes. In this paper, we investigate the reconfigurability issue in the multi-star implementation of ShuffEeNet. We show how we can attain maximum reeonfigurability b y properly choosing the system parameters. An algorithm for channels allocation is proposed to maximize reconfigurability under a particular configuration.	acoustic coupler;algorithm;logical topology;reconfigurability;star coupler;star network;transceiver	Philip P.

To overcome the current limitations of wireless access networks, operators already push for very dense and heterogeneous wireless networks, commonly known as DenseNets. Efficiently controlling DenseNets is a task for current research, as simply scaling existing networks by orders of magnitude brings along several problems, e.g. increased energy consumption and the explosion of signaling. Further, new innovations such as Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) which target the operation expenses for networks with a large variety of proprietary hardware appliances, reveal that data flow processing should not be neglected in this research domain. Software-Defined Networking (SDN), which separates the control plane and the data forwarding plane, has been identified as a promising approach for an efficient control of DenseNets. However, the controllers of classic SDN approaches are confined to the routing of data flows, while the support of sophisticated processing mechanisms, e.g. NFV or Coordinated Multi-Point transmission (CoMP), is not considered. Data flow processing imposes many requirements on data rate, latency and processing capacity. Hence, an adequate allocation of the locations for data processing in a network is a challenging task and crucial for network performance. In this paper we propose our flow processing-aware controller placement framework that takes into account data flow processing and control applications, both enhancing the SDN architecture specifically for DenseNets.	access network;approximation algorithm;control plane;data rate units;dataflow architecture;forwarding plane;heuristic (computer science);image scaling;mathematical optimization;multi-core processor;np-hardness;network function virtualization;network performance;operand forwarding;optimization problem;proprietary hardware;requirement;routing;software deployment;software-defined networking;wireless access point	SÃ©bastien Auroux;Holger Karl	2014	2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136368	routing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;process control;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-13.635166778995872	85.28274502863125	164055
857317cf92acda55496a62db7fd29a2d9c3fc3da	dynamic distributed flow scheduling for effective link utilization in data center networks	flowlet splitting;data center networks;link utilization;load balancing	Current static flow scheduling techniques such as Equal Cost Multi Path (ECMP) and Valiant Load Balancing (VLB) use randomization and hash based techniques to schedule the flow in Data Center Networks (DCN). In such flow scheduling techniques, the probability of allotment of the same path for different flows at a time is high. This causes collision of flows and at times can lead to unfair link utilization. On other hand, Dynamic flow scheduling techniques such as Global first fit use a centralized mechanism to schedule flows. Global first fit can introduce the problem of unfair link utilization and also vulnerable to a single point of failure. Effective flow scheduling is the key problem in fat-tree topology based DCNs mainly due to the bandwidth over-subscription ratio and bursty nature of traffic. In this paper, we propose a dynamic distributed flow scheduling mechanism for effective link utilization and load balancing. Moreover our proposed mechanism prevents the core switch saturation scenario by taking flow scheduling decisions at lower layers. Load measurement performed on aggregate switches for various data center traffic flow patterns reveals that the load factors across all the aggregate switches vary by at most 0.11 when dynamic distributed flow scheduling is applied without flowlet splitting. Further with flowlet splitting our dynamic distributed flow scheduling mechanism improved the load factor variation to 0.08. The load factor values signify there is considerable improvement in link utilization and the switches are fairly load balanced. The experiment scenario is simulated using Colored Petri Nets.	data center;scheduling (computing)	Sourabh Bharti;Kiran Kumar Pattanaik	2014	J.

a62fd49ecf8080ab1e6bf7ce8dc579ba49f53841	connecting the edges: a universal, mobile-centric, and opportunistic communications architecture		The Internet has crossed new frontiers with access to it getting faster and cheaper. Considering that the architectural foundations of today's Internet were laid more than three decades ago, the Internet has done remarkably well until today coping with the growing demand. However, the future Internet architecture is expected to support not only the ever growing number of users and devices, but also a diverse set of new applications and services. Departing from the traditional host-centric access paradigm, where access to a desired content is mapped to its location, an information-centric model enables the association of access to a desired content with the content itself, irrespective of the location where it is being held. UMOBILE tailors the information-centric communication model to meet the requirements of opportunistic communications, integrating those connectivity approaches into a single architecture. By pushing services near the edge of the network, such an architecture can pervasively operate in any networking environment and allows for the development of innovative applications, providing access to data independent of the level of end-to-end connectivity availability.	end-to-end principle;future internet;programming paradigm;requirement	Christos-Alexandros Sarros;Sotirios Diamantopoulos;Sergi Rene;Ioannis Psaras;Adisorn Lertsinsrubtavee;Carlos Molina-JimÃ©nez;Paulo Mendes;Rute C.

d0fccebc5618fed460b6bf3beca1dfc823194b16	a framework for improving network resilience using sdn and fog nodes		The IoT (Internet of Things) is one of the primary reasons for the massive growth in the number of connected devices to the Internet, thus leading to an increased volume of traffic in the core network. Fog and edge computing are becoming a solution to handle IoT traffic by moving timesensitive processing to the edge of the network, while using the conventional cloud for historical analysis and long-term storage. Providing processing, storage, and network communication at the edge network are the aim of fog computing to reduce delay, network traffic, and decentralise computing. In this paper, we define a framework that realises fog computing that can be extended to install any service of choice. Our framework utilises fog nodes as an extension of the traditional switch to include processing, networking, and storage. The fog nodes act as local decision-making elements that interface with software-defined networking (SDN), to be able to push updates throughout the network. To test our framework, we develop an IP spoofing security application and ensure its correctness through multiple experiments.	correctness (computer science);edge computing;experiment;fog computing;ip address spoofing;internet of things;intrusion detection system;machine learning;network packet;network switch;network traffic control;openflow;software-defined networking	Amir Modarresi;Siddharth Gangadhar;James P.

Peer-to-peer storage networks based on distributed hash tables are attractive for their efficient use of resources and resulting performance. The placement and subsequent efficient location of replicas in such systems remain open problems, especially (1) the requirement to update replicated content, (2) working in the absence of global information, and (3) determination of the locations in a dynamic system without introducing single points of failure. We present and evaluate a novel and versatile technique, replica enumeration, which allows for controlled replication and replica access. The possibility of enumerating and addressing individual replicas allows dynamic updates as well as superior performance without burdening the network with state information, yet taking advantage of locality information when available.

7c4c3045abe337b1831e0fbf59862140bcd7ff51	brief announcement: on the hardness of topology inference	network topology	Many systems require information about the topology of networks on the Internet, for purposes like management, efficiency, testing of new protocols and so on. However, ISPs usually do not share the actual topology maps with outsiders. Consequently, many systems have been devised to reconstruct the topology of networks on the Internet from publicly observable data. Such systems rely on traceroute to provide path information, and attempt to compute the network topology from these paths. However, traceroute has the problem that some routers refuse to reveal their addresses, and appear as anonymous nodes in traces. Previous research on the problem of topology inference with anonymous nodes has demonstrated that it is at best NP-complete. We prove a stronger result. There exists no algorithm that, given an arbitrary trace set with anonymous nodes, can determine the topology of the network that generated the trace set. Even the weak version of the problem, which allows an algorithm to output a âsmallâ set of topologies such that the correct topology is included in the solution set, is not solvable: there exist trace sets such that any algorithm guaranteed to output the correct topology outputs at least an exponential number of networks. We show how to construct such a pathological case even when the network is known to have exactly two anonymous nodes.	algorithm;decision problem;existential quantification;internet;map;np-completeness;network topology;observable;time complexity;traceroute;tracing (software)	Hrishikesh B.

fc6ce7686a07ddc057fc27f11c33ebd0457c939a	bbu location algorithms for survivable 5g c-ran over wdm		Abstract New 5G radio access network is expected to offer competitive advantages in terms of cost, quality of service and mobility, that make it attractive for service providers. The resilience of this part of the network is consequently essential to provide high availability and service continuity in case of failure. This study focuses on heuristic solutions to design and operate the fronthaul network based on the Centralized Radio Access Network (C-RAN) concept. Facility Location Algorithms (FLA) are proposed to assign primary and backup functionalities to Baseband Unit (BBU) hotels and ensure availability in case of a single BBU hotel or link failure. Sharing techniques are applied to BBU hotel ports and transport wavelengths for hl cost-efficient design. The goal is to minimize the number of active BBU hotels while providing full coverage to all Remote Radio Units (RRU). Numerical results evaluate cost in relation to main design constraints, namely the number of hops allowed to reach primary and backup BBU hotel. The number of BBU hotels is compared for different location algorithms, showing that a proposed extension of a classical FLA, by including resilience, allows to obtain the best results both in terms of BBU hotels and shared ports. However, the need of suitable trade-off between the number of BBU hotels and the required wavelengths is outlined, depending on relative costs.	algorithm;c-ran;wavelength-division multiplexing	Bahare M.

A nanosatellite constellation is composed of a certain number of nanosatellites distributed in one or more orbital planes. In most cases, this network cannot ensure an end-to-end connection between sources and destinations, because not all satellite links are up at the same time. The Delay and Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) paradigm is so necessary to deal with predictable disruptions and large delays, allowing nanosatellites, Internet gateways (also called hot spots), and rural gateways (also called cold spots) to keep data stored in their buffers also for tens of minutes waiting to be forwarded. We focused our attention on a possible selection strategy which indicates to all nanosatellites how many bundles (PDUs of the DTN protocol) they can upload from rural gateways during each contact. The decision is made by considering the maximum amount of data that nanosatellites and cold spots can exchange during each contact (quantity related to contact durations) and the possible presence of congestion situations in rural and remote areas or in nanosatellites. The proposed strategy is called ColdSel: it calculates the amount of bundles that each cold spot has to upload on the nanosatellite in contact with in order to mitigate congestion situations in rural areas and nanosatellites and to reduce the nanosatellite buffer occupancies so improving the performance in terms of data delivery time.	delay-tolerant networking;end-to-end principle;itil;internet access;molecular orbital;network congestion;programming paradigm;selection algorithm;upload	Marco Cello;Mario Marchese;Fabio Patrone	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841670	the internet;simulation;logic gate;telecommunications;operating system;computer security;bandwidth;satellite;computer network	Mobile	-9.220603184481213	87.77506666749576	166533

In-network caching as one of its key functions, has been studied extensively to achieve less content access delay and to reduce traffic load. However, current caching schemes mostly suffer from a poor utilization of cache space; since many content replicas are replaced without being hit by coming requests. As the limited cache space in networks, less popular contents have much less replicas than the popular ones, and the requests for them will cause considerable delay. In this paper, a content popularity and node level matched based probability caching strategy (MPC) is proposed to maximize the cache utilization and to improve the content diversity in networks simultaneously. We first evaluate the caching property of nodes along the delivery path by utilizing multi-parameters, and classify nodes into levels according to their caching property. Then, we assign contents to the nodes with their matched level, which balances the proportion of contents with different popularities in the network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can achieve less content access delay, higher cache hit ratio, and richer content diversity.	cpu cache;cache (computing);cyclomatic complexity;future internet;hit (internet);simulation	Yao Li;Tiankui Zhang;Xiaogeng Xu;Zhimin Zeng;Yinlong Liu	2016	2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636877	cache;computer science;smart cache;internet privacy;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	-14.735860574891282	75.01693261062086	166640

However, transport networks are actually heterogeneous networks consisting of multiple layers and domains unlike data center networks where SDN have been applied. In addition, virtualization of network resources is also expected by applying SDN. We propose a network orchestrator based on ODENOS for orchestrating multi-layer and multi-domain networks and for providing virtual views to users. Proposed network orchestrator has four features. Firstly, a common data model is introduced for solving a problem of differences among layers and domains. Secondly, relations between layers/domains are managed for solving a problem about lack of managing relations between layers/domains. Thirdly, data model and interfaces are converted between the network orchestrator and layer/domain for solving a problem of differences of methods of path setup among layers/domains. Lastly, a virtual view is created for each user with separated topology based on an ID of each user for solving a problem about lack of a method to create separated views for each user. Results of performance evaluations show that the proposed network orchestrator can dynamically provide virtual views to users on demand.	data center;data model;global variable;high availability;identifier;layer (electronics);open-source software;performance;provisioning;semantic network;software-defined networking	Yohei Iizawa;Kazuya Z.

d435edd478ad59d29d806c0755eb9e1da3016220	service provisioning in vehicular networks through edge and cloud: an empirical analysis		Vehicular Cloud Computing is a network infrastructure paradigm that has been largely used in the vehicular systems landscape for improving driversu0027 experience. In particular, the higher computational resources made available by cloud computing technologies have helped in coping with the tremendous growth of data traffic exchanged within vehicular networks. However, the advanced development of such infrastructure, together with the relentless proliferation of services and applications characterized by heterogeneous and demanding requirements, has led to redefine the way in which cellular-based vehicular networks assist vehicular communications. As an example, Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) is an emerging network paradigm that can be exploited also in vehicular scenarios to foster a more effective and flexible service delivery. Although in literature the migration of vehicular systems towards a MEC-based approach has been already envisaged giving rise to the concept of Vehicular Edge Computing, a not fully investigated aspect is represented by the lack of experimental insights that shed light on the actual feasibility of this emerging network infrastructures. In this paper, we try to fill the gap in this respect by presenting an extensive empirical analysis performed through a vehicular system testbed. In particular, our work aims at providing empirical insights on the advantages that an edge cloud-based service provisioning can enable in comparison to a centralized cloud-based approach. Besides, by focusing only on the transmission of small-sized workload-i.e. with payload comparable to the one produced by In-Vehicleu0027s sensors-this work also aims at evaluating the suitability of different application layer protocols (HTTP, CoAP, and MQTT) in this peculiar context. In the performance analysis, additional aspects have been also considered, including the impact of vehicleu0027s speed as well as scalability issues.

180353842ed0611f577caa0fe028505e0c2554a9	ilp formulation for controller tree design in sdn		We consider a software defined network (SDN) with a single controller communicating with all switches through a spanning tree rooted at the controller, or a controller tree. When a switch fails, its immediate downstream switch(es) will detect the failure. A downstream switch is protected if it has a neighbor whose path to the controller is not affected by this failure. By rerouting its traffic to this neighbor, the protected switch will bypass the failure (of its parent). On the other hand, an unprotected switch cannot bypass the failure using the local rerouting above; and the subtree rooted at the unprotected switch will be disconnected from the controller. Let the weight of an unprotected switch be the number of switches in the subtree. Then the weight of a controller tree is the total weight of all unprotected switches. In this paper, we focus on the problem of finding the minimum weight controller tree (mwCT). We first introduce a new switch protection mechanism called sibling protection. We then prove that the mwCT problem is NP-hard. To solve it, we formulate the first Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We show that the solutions obtained by an existing heuristic are far from optimal.	downstream (software development);file spanning;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;minimum weight;minimum-weight triangulation;np-hardness;network switch;protection mechanism;software-defined networking;spanning tree;tree (data structure)	Ze Yang;Kwan Lawrence Yeung	2017	2017 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing (HPSR)	10.1109/HPSR.2017.7968689	real-time computing;control theory;computer network;protection mechanism;computer science;tree (data structure);software-defined networking;minimum weight;integer programming;routing protocol;spanning tree;distributed computing	Embedded	-7.127968423974477	80.59733938444927	167470

This design assumes that routing information at each member node must be kept small, so that the bookkeeping required to respond to system membership changes is also small, given that aggressive membership dynamics are expected. As a consequence, lookups have high latency as each lookup requires contacting several nodes in sequence. In this paper, we question these assumptions by presenting two peer-to-peer routing algorithms with small lookup paths. First, we present a one-hop routing scheme. We show how to disseminate information about membership changes quickly enough so that nodes maintain accurate routing tables with complete membership information. We also deduce analytic bandwidth requirements for our scheme that demonstrate its feasibility. We also propose a two-hop routing scheme for large scale systems of more than a few million nodes, where the bandwidth requirements of one-hop routing can become too large. This scheme keeps a fixed fraction of the total routing state on each node, chosen such that the first hop has low latency, and thus the additional delay is small. We validate our analytic model using simulation results that show that our algorithms can maintain routing information sufficiently up-to-date such that a large fraction (e.g., 99%) of the queries will succeed without being re-routed.	algorithm;backup;cache (computing);glossary of computer graphics;load balancing (computing);lookup table;peer-to-peer;requirement;routing table;simulation	Anjali Gupta;Barbara Liskov;Rodrigo Rodrigues	2004			policy-based routing;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;operating system;key-based routing;database;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network;low latency	Networks	-13.140539114591755	75.43420810989338	167478

988474d1e032a8236c7de7964fb334a48c0d329f	a light-weight approach to obtaining nf state information in sdn+nfv networks		The combination of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) possesses a great potential in accommodating dynamic network control via cloning/migration of virtualized NFs and steering of traffic flows. A great challenge is the lack of the proprietary internal NF state information to the control system (including SDN controller and NFV orchestrator), which may lead to incorrect packet/flow processing at the newly created NF instances. In this work, we design a light-weight approach which can function either independently or as a plug-in to the network control system to reveal the internal NF states. Unlike the previous work, we propose to learn the internal NF states through normal network functions instead of designing extra APIs for certain NFs. Moreover, we propose a feasible way to detect state violations and even correct them automatically. Our approach is tested by experiments, and the results confirm its efficiency and practicability.	control system;experiment;network function virtualization;network packet;new foundations;plug-in (computing);software-defined networking;traffic flow (computer networking)	Bing Leng;Liusheng Huang;Chunming Qiao;Hongli Xu	2018	IEEE INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8486217	control theory;noise measurement;network functions virtualization;distributed computing;dynamic network analysis;network packet;software-defined networking;computer science;control system	Visualization	-14.507888921374425	81.5916758890785	167611

Unfortunately, LFA cannot provide protection for all possible failure cases in general. Recently, the IETF has initiated the Remote Loop-Free Alternates (rLFA) technique, as a simple extension to LFA, to boost the fraction of failure cases covered by fast protection. Before further standardization and deployment, however, it is crucial to determine to what extent rLFA can improve the level of protection in a general IP network, as well as to find optimization methods to tweak a network for 100% rLFA coverage. In this paper, we take the first steps towards this goal by solving these problems in the special, but practically relevant, case when each network link is of unit cost. We also provide preliminary numerical evaluations conducted on real IP network topologies, which suggest that rLFA significantly improves the level of protection, and most networks need only 2 - 3 new links to be added to attain 100% failure case coverage.	fast reroute;flow network;greedy algorithm;mathematical optimization;multiprotocol label switching;network topology;numerical analysis;optimization problem;pointer (computer programming);software deployment;topological graph theory	Levente Csikor;GÃ¡bor RÃ©tvÃ¡ri	2012	2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems	10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459750	multiprotocol label switching;virtual routing and forwarding;overlay network;next-generation network;telecommunications;numerical analysis;computer science;label switching;optical ip switching;ip forwarding;l2tpv3;distributed computing;ip tunnel;telecommunications network;computer network	Metrics	-7.935614830254938	81.93147752377264	167685

This separation introduces new concerns towards the resilience of the network, which now presents different vulnerabilities related to the interaction between these planes. A resilience factor for Software Defined Networks is proposed, using multiple metrics to analyze intrinsic features of its architecture, serving as an indication for its resilience. Beyond that, topological augmentation algorithms are employed to increase the resilience of test topologies, as indicated by the proposed factor. Tests results demonstrate an improvement of the topologies' resilience characteristics.	algorithm;programming paradigm	Pedro Montibeler;Fernando N. N.

As traffic often changes from time to time, the problem of grooming dynamic traffic is of great practical value. In this article, we discuss the dynamic grooming of traffic in star and tree networks. A genetic algorithm (GA) based approach is proposed to support arbitrary dynamic traffic patterns, which minimizes the number of ADMs and wavelengths. To evaluate the algorithm, tighter bounds are derived. Computer simulation results show that our algorithm is efficient in reducing both the number of ADMs and wavelengths in tree and star networks.	bifurcation theory;communications of the acm;computer simulation;cybernetics;entityârelationship model;genetic algorithm;heuristic;ieee/acm transactions on networking;interrupt;lecture notes in computer science;lightwave 3d;mesh networking;nonblocking minimal spanning switch;optical mesh network;sirocco;software release life cycle;synchronous optical networking;token ring;wavelength-division multiplexing	Kun-hong Liu;Yong Xu;De-shuang Huang;Min Cheng	2007	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-007-0103-0	computer simulation;genetic algorithm;traffic grooming;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	-5.652387889134277	80.70517370447548	167995
7cda400f79888ba76df9f2929b3c01d57828dce7	a multi-objective optimization model based on immune algorithm in wireless mesh networks	immune algorithm;wmns;multi objective optimization model	With the characteristics of high self-organized, dynamic, and interoperable, the wireless mesh network WMN is deemed as a potential technology to be applied widely for home, enterprise, and social public service. Many current optimization schemes usually focus on a single metric such as network deployment cost, throughput, QoS, and so on, but few schemes consider that the optimized metric may affect other metrics of WMN. In practice, the influence among the different metrics is often nonignorable. To optimize the performance from a global perspective, we propose a multi-objective optimization model based on immune algorithm MOM-IA, which provides a paradigm to find the optimal solution satisfying some different restriction conditions. To simplify, MOM-IA mainly analyzes the restriction relationship of connectivity, redundancy, and throughput, which are the multiple objects. Considering the characteristic of dynamic and the discrete integer parameters in WMN, we design a longtime evolution immune algorithm to solve the MOM. Finally, the analysis of experiments presents that MOM-IA has good performance in solution set diversity and Pareto-front distribution, which means the probability to find the optimal solution in WMN.

1423ab00ef019cf2a0ddc06fa3db3276ab0c277d	router power consumption analysis: towards green communications	articulo;green networks;power consumption;switches;routers	In recent years, the number of network devices which are being used in new network infrastructure and intelligent buildings, are growing more and more. Because these devices can often have high processing activity, we must consider their power consumption. Their energy requirements may vary depending on their operation mode, their processing capacity and even the type of devices to which are connected. The ability to determine exact consumption of network can provide an optimal network design and the other auxiliary systems, such as cool system, which may be necessary for the proper operation of the network. In this paper we determine the power consumption generated by network devices of different manufacturers and models. These tests allow us to see the energy consumed when they are in await mode and when they are working, running a routing protocol in order to interconnect different networks, promoting the development of the sustainable Green Networks.	computer cooling;maxdiff;network planning and design;requirement;router (computing);routing	Sebastian Andrade-Morelli;Eduardo Ruiz-Sanchez;Sandra Sendra;Jaime Lloret Mauri	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-37977-2_3	real-time computing;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;computer security	Metrics	-18.25760779060737	78.69080473364757	168343

Based on the nature of the demands, it may be convenient to set up lightpaths on these networks with different bit rates. Then, the network design cost could be reduced because low-bit-rate services will need less grooming (i.e., less multiplexing with other low-bit-rate services onto high-capacity wavelengths) while high-bit-rate services can be accommodated on a wavelength itself. Future optical networks may support mixed line rates (say over 10/40/100 Gbps). Since a lightpath may travel a long distance, for high bit rates, the effect of the physical impairments along a lightpath may become very significant (leading to high bit-error rate (BER)); and the signal's maximum transmission range, which depends on the bit rate, will become limited. In this study, we propose a novel, cost-effective approach to design a mixed-line-rate (MLR) network with transmission-range (TR) constraint. By intelligent assignment of channel rates to lightpaths, based on their TR constraint, the need for signal regeneration can be minimized, and a ''transparent'' optical network can be designed to support all-optical end-to-end lightpaths. The design problem is formulated as an integer linear program (ILP). A heuristic algorithm is also proposed. Our results show that, with mixed line rates and maximum transmission range constraints, one can design a cost-effective network.	network planning and design	Avishek Nag;Massimo Tornatore	2009	Optical Switching and Networking	10.1016/j.osn.2009.08.010	heuristic;network planning and design;cost-effectiveness analysis;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network	Theory	-6.175132380222377	83.91354346827414	168360

Based on Centralized control, SDN technology has proved its positive impact on the world of network communications from different aspects. Security in SDN, as in traditional networks, is an essential feature that every communication system should possess. In this paper, we propose an SDN security design approach, which strikes a good balance between network performance and security features. We show how such an approach can be used to prevent DDoS attacks targeting either the controller or the different hosts in the network, and how to trace back the source of the attack. The solution lies in introducing a third plane, the security plane, in addition to the data plane, which is responsible for forwarding data packets between SDN switches, and parallel to the control plane, which is responsible for rule and data exchange between the switches and the SDN controller. The security plane is designed to exchange security-related data between a third party agent on the switch and a third party software module alongside the controller. Our evaluation shows the capability of the proposed system to enforce different levels of real-time user-defined security with low overhead and minimal configuration.	centralized computing;control plane;denial-of-service attack;dynamical system;forwarding plane;function overloading;graphical user interface;ip address spoofing;modular programming;network packet;network performance;network switch;overhead (computing);prototype;real-time clock;real-time computing;remote control;software-defined networking;third-party software component	Ali Hussein;Imad H.

Recently, Content-Centric Networking (CCN), or the socalled Information-Centric Networking (ICN), has been proposed for efficient content delivery. In this paper, we investigate the performance of in-network caching for Named Data Networking (NDN), which is a promising CCN proposal. First, we examine the inefficiency of LRU (Least Recently Used) which is a basic cache replacement policy in NDN. Then we formulate the optimal content assignment for two in-network caching policies. One is Single-Path Caching, which allows a request to be served from routers only along the path between a requester and a content source. The other is Network-Wide Caching, which enables a request to be served from any router holding the requested content in a network. For both policies, we use a Mixed Integer Program to optimize the content assignment models by considering the link cost, cache size, and content popularity. We also consider the impact of link capacity and routing issues on the optimal content assignment. Our evaluation and analysis present the performance bounds of in-network caching on NDN in terms of the practical constraints, such as the link cost, link capacity, and cache size. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

df79ee1487612534c6d7168a8cbe71bf24fc5a3e	measurement and analytics on social groups of device-to-device sharing in mobile social networks		Recently many studies demonstrate that exploiting the Device-to-Device (D2D) content sharing in offline Mobile Social Networks (MSNs) is a promising solution to offload cellular data to local connectivities in proximity to reduce the duplicated cellular transmissions via the backbone network demanded by nearby users and hence to improve users' quality of service (QoS). However, related D2D-based social sharing and offloading proposals are based on either assumptions and theoretical models, or limited data-driven analysis caused by small scale of data sets (e.g. hundreds of MSN users) or single-dimensional feature (e.g. human mobility only), which severely restricts applications in practice. In this paper, we perform the world-first large-scale measurement and analytics on D2D-based content sharing groups from the perspective of social networks via the platform of Xender, a leading global D2D sharing platform in Asia. We analyze the behaviours of about 30 million users with 443 million D2D transmissions of 17 million files in 884 thousand social groups, and unveil the details of social structure properties, network motifs, cascade trees of friendship and propagation, which are helpful for improving the service of social D2D sharing.

Recently, several coupled network models have been developed to describe the interactions between real-world networked systems. In interconnected communication networks, the coupling links refer to the physical links between networks and provide paths for traffic transmission. In this brief, we employ a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to find a near-optimal configuration of the coupling links, which effectively improves the overall traffic capacity compared with random, assortative, and disassortative couplings.

To complete the discussion of network architecture, this paper focuses on the different node architectures, and compares their performance in terms of scalability and flexibility. Thereafter, this paper reviews and classifies routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) approaches including their pros and cons.

The structure and architecture will require high efficiency and scalability in network operation and management. In this paper, we address main requirements and challenges of future cellular networks and introduce network function virtualisation (NFV) with software defined networking (SDN) to realize the self-organizing (SO) scheme. NFV integrates the hardware appliances together in industry standard servers. And SDN performs as core controller of the network. The proposed SO scheme is based on soft fractional frequency reuse (SFFR) framework. The scheme takes different traffic demands into consideration and allocates the power adaptively.

A systematic incremental deployment methodology as well as a hybrid operation model is needed. We present such a system for incremental deployment of hybrid SDN networks consisting of both legacy forwarding devices (i.e., traditional IP routers) and programmable SDN switches. We design the system on a production SDN controller to answer the following questions: which legacy devices to upgrade to SDN, and how legacy and SDN devices can interoperate in a hybrid environment to satisfy a variety of traffic engineering (TE) goals such as load balancing and fast failure recovery. Evaluation on real ISP and enterprise topologies shows that with only 20% devices upgraded to SDN, our system reduces the maximum link usage by an average of 32% compared with pure-legacy networks (shortest path routing), while only requiring an average of 41% of flow table capacity compared with pure-SDN networks.	interoperability;load balancing (computing);network switch;routing;shortest path problem;software deployment;software-defined networking;test engineer	David Ke Hong;Yadi Ma;Sujata Banerjee;Zhuoqing Morley Mao	2016		10.1145/2890955.2890959	real-time computing;engineering;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-13.590948532134867	82.80195907600933	169292

The cost of the one-off prototype was below a third of the prices of comparable proprietary solutions and half of other open source alternatives. It can be reduced further in series production.

In such networks, one physical set of transport links can be configured into many different logical networks, in order to meet uncertain and volatile traffic demands. Connectability is a figure of merit for capturing the composite routing efficiency and capacity utilization of a transport network. Connectability is mathematically inspired by existing metrics for reliability. Reliability concepts are adapted to quantify notions of efficiency in reconfigurable networks. We define connectability mathematically, and set out a procedure for itsâ calculation in a distributed real-time setting. The centralized version of this calculation has O(TL log 7r,) time complexity. A series of simulation studies are presented to illustrate the use of connectability in characterizing strategies for transport network reconfiguration. One strategy based on the isolated calculation of connectability at each node is shown to yield lower blocking and more efficient use of transport network resources than the other strategies tested. Finally, a short study of applying connectability to restoration in a national network demonstrates that there is a continuum along which restoration can be temporarily traded off against transport network management.	apache continuum;blocking (computing);centralized computing;circuit restoration;real-time clock;reconfigurability;routing;simulation;time complexity	Mike H.

In this work, we study survivable service provisioning with shared protection under a scheduled traffic model in wavelength convertible WDM optical mesh networks. In this model, a set of demands is given, and the setup time and teardown time of a demand are known in advance. Based on different protection schemes used, this problem has been formulated as integer linear programs with different optimization objectives and constraints in our previous work [8, 9]. The problem is shown to be NP- hard. We therefore study time efficient approaches to approximating the optimal solution to the problem. Our proposed approach is based on an iterative survivable routing (ISR) scheme that utilizes a capacity provision matrix and processes demands sequentially using different demand scheduling policies. The objective is to minimize the total network resources (e.g., number of wavelength-links) used by working paths and protection paths of a given set of demands while 100% restorability is guaranteed against any single failure. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against solutions obtained by integer linear programming. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed ISR algorithm is extremely time efficient while achieving excellent performance in terms of total network resources used. The impact of demand scheduling policies on the ISR algorithm is also studied.	approximation algorithm;computation;emoticon;flip-flop (electronics);hard coding;information systems research;integer programming;iterative method;linear programming;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;optical mesh network;provisioning;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications network;wavelength-division multiplexing	Tianjian Li;Bin Wang	2006	2006 3rd International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems	10.1109/BROADNETS.2006.4374348	real-time computing;integer programming;computer science;mesh networking;np-hard;distributed computing;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network	Metrics	-5.7802564623336625	82.07115945294315	169781

To this end, we propose Saxons, a distributed software layer that dynamically maintains a selected set of overlay links for a group of nodes. Saxons maintains high-quality overlay structures with three performance objectives: low path latency, low hop-count distance, and high path bandwidth. Additionally, it provides partition repair support for the overlay structure. Saxons targets large self-organizing services with high scalability and stability requirements. Services can directly utilize the Saxons structure for overlay communication. Saxons can also benefit unicast or multicast overlay path selection services by providing them a small link selection base without hurting their performance potential. Our simulations and experiments on 55 PlanetLab sites demonstrate Saxonsâs structure quality and the performance of Saxons-based service construction. In particular, a simple overlay multicast service built on Saxons provides nearloss-free data delivery to 4 times more multicast receivers compared with the same multicast service running on random overlay structures. This performance is close to that of direct Internet unicast without simultaneous traffic.	distributed computing;experiment;multicast;organizing (structure);overlay network;planetlab;requirement;scalability;self-organization;simulation;unicast	Kai Shen	2004			self-organization;overlay network;computer science;distributed computing;world wide web;computer network	Networks	-12.206137552987288	77.32247529312488	169788
8bd36b4012becb0bff73cdfd61d863643636c4a7	demo abstract: el-sec: elastic management of security applications on virtualized infrastructure		The concept of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) aims to move Network Functions (NFs) out of dedicated hardware devices into software that runs on commodity hardware. A single NF consists of multiple VNF instances, usually running on virtual machines in a cloud infrastructure. The elastic management of an NF refers to load management across the VNF instances and the autonomic scaling of the number of VNF instances as the load on the NF changes. In this paper, we present EL-SEC, an autonomic framework to elastically manage security NFs on a virtualized infrastructure. As a use case, we deploy the Snort Intrusion Detection System as the NF on the GENI testbed. Concepts from control theory are used to create an Elastic Manager, which implements various controllers â in this paper, Proportional Integral (PI) and Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) â to direct traffic across the VNF Snort instances by monitoring the current load. RINA (a cleanslate Recursive InterNetwork Architecture) is used to build a distributed application that monitors load and collects Snort alerts, which are processed by the Elastic Manager and an Attack Analyzer, respectively. Software Defined Networking (SDN) is used to steer traffic through the VNF instances, and to block attack traffic. Our results show that virtualized security NFs can be easily deployed using our EL-SEC framework. With the help of real-time graphs, we show that PI and PID controllers can be used to easily scale the system, which leads to quicker detection of attacks.	autonomic computing;clean slate program;cloud computing;commodity computing;computer security;control theory;distributed computing;experiment;image scaling;integral cryptanalysis;internetworking;intrusion detection system;load (computing);load management;machine learning;network function virtualization;pid;real-time clock;serverless computing;snort;software-defined networking;testbed;virtual machine	Nabeel Akhtar;Ibrahim Matta;Ali Raza;Yuefeng Wang	2018		10.1109/INFCOMW.2018.8406988	pi;architecture;software-defined networking;cloud computing;real-time computing;intrusion detection system;testbed;control system;virtual machine;computer science	Security	-15.885199630593696	81.25959433483884	169933

It splits the function of today's IP addresses into two separate pieces. End-hosts are addressed using identifiers which are not globally routable while network attachment points have globally routable locators assigned. In most architectures, either the sending host or an intermediate node has to query a mapping system to obtain locators for identifiers. Such a mapping system must be fast, reliable, secure, and may be able to relay data packets. In this paper, we propose requirements and a general taxonomy for mapping systems and use it to provide a survey on recent proposals. We address general aspects of mapping systems and point out remaining research opportunities.	attachments;future internet;identifier;network packet;online locator service;relay;requirement;routing;scalability;taxonomy (general)	Michael Hoefling;Michael Menth;Matthias Hartmann	2013	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/SURV.2013.011413.00039	communications protocol;the internet;locator/identifier separation protocol;network packet;logic gate;computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Networks	-11.552219402844559	87.07390389300214	169988

On the other hand, network operators cannot share such connections between customers, because DC traffic varies greatly over time. Those connections are used to perform virtual machine migration and database synchronization among federated DCs, allowing elastic DC operations. To improve resource utilization and save costs, dynamic inter-DC connectivity is currently being targeted from a research point of view and in standardization form. In this article, we show that dynamic connectivity is not enough to guarantee elastic DC operations and might lead to poor performance provided that not enough overprovisioning of network resources is performed. To alleviate it to some extent, we propose using the flexgrid optical technology that enables finer spectrum granularity adaptation and the ability to dynamically increase and decrease the amount of optical resources assigned to connections. DCs can be interconnected through a flexgrid-based network controlled using a centralized software defined network, based on the architecture currently being proposed by the IETF; a cross-stratum orchestrator architecture coordinates DC and network elastically. Illustrative results show that dynamic elastic connectivity provides benefits by reducing the amount of overprovisioned network resources and facilitating elastic DC operations.	centralized computing;data center;dynamic connectivity;provisioning;software-defined networking;virtual machine	Luis Velasco;Adrian Asensio;Alberto Castro;Josep Lluis Berral;David Carrera;VÃ­ctor LÃ³pez;Juan P.

2eefc61869284dfb179f318559644f4b34193633	fly-over: a light-weight distributed power-gating mechanism for energy-efficient networks-on-chip		Scalable Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) have become the de facto interconnection mechanism in large scale Chip Multiprocessors. Not only are NoCs devouring a large fraction of the on-chip power budget but static NoC power consumption is becoming the dominant component as technology scales down. Hence reducing static NoC power consumption is critical for energy-efficient computing. Previous research has proposed to power-gate routers attached to inactive cores so as to save static power, but requires centralized control and global network knowledge. In this paper, we propose Fly-Over (FLOV), a light-weight distributed mechanism for power-gating routers, which encompasses FLOV router architecture, handshake protocols, and a partition-based dynamic routing algorithm to maintain network functionalities. With simple modifications to the baseline router architecture, FLOV can facilitate FLOV links over power-gated routers. Then we present two handshake protocols for FLOV routers, restricted FLOV that can power-gate routers under restricted conditions and generalized FLOV with more power saving capability. The proposed routing algorithm provides best-effort minimal path routing without the necessity for global network information. We evaluate our schemes using synthetic workloads as well as real workloads from PARSEC 2.1 benchmark suite. Our full system evaluations show that FLOV reduces the total and static energy consumption by 18% and 22% respectively, on average across several benchmarks, compared to state-of-the-art NoC power-gating mechanism while keeping the performance degradation minimal.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);benchmark (computing);best-effort delivery;centralized computing;challenge-handshake authentication protocol;dhrystone;elegant degradation;global network;interconnection;network on a chip;parsec;power gating;router (computing);routing;system on a chip	Rahul Boyapati;Jiayi Huang;Ningyuan Wang;Kyung Hoon Kim;Ki Hwan Yum;Eun Jung Kim	2017	2017 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)	10.1109/IPDPS.2017.77	computer science;parallel computing;distributed computing;router;scalability;architecture;power budget;routing domain;static routing;computer network;routing protocol;convergence (routing)	Arch	-9.619696596840393	81.41093740505836	170127

Meanwhile, with the growth of the communication and processing capacity of the Internet of Things (IoT), the sensor devices develop rapidly in agricultural applications and environments. In this study, agricultural sensors deploy based on the SDN and IoT network architecture first. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) combined with Bacteria-Inspired Network (BIN) is proposed in this work to calculate the data path and find the best routing that confirms the QoS of agricultural requirements. Numerical results show that the proposed method provides a reliable QoS architecture for IoT sensors and reduces the end-to-end communication in SDWBIN Network.	application programming interface;dijkstra's algorithm;end-to-end principle;genetic algorithm;internet of things;network architecture;network performance;numerical method;quality of service;quantum superposition;requirement;routing;sensor;software-defined networking;telecommunications network	Yao-Chung Chang;Wei-Xuan Cai;Jin-Wei Jhuang	2018	2018 27th Wireless and Optical Communication Conference (WOCC)	10.1109/WOCC.2018.8372712	computer network;bin;genetic algorithm;computer science;network architecture;architecture;wireless;quality of service;software-defined networking;mobile telephony	Mobile	-13.258286508212521	86.92308221448685	170273

We posit that it is caused by the combined effects of the imbalanced geographic coverage of mobile networks and users' lacking (and thus ignoring) such information when choosing their travel paths. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, network-oriented navigation (NetNavi), for mobile users to improve their network access on a trip. More specifically, we overlay the physical road map with mobile network performance maps to find paths satisfying user needs on both network quality and travel delay. Through evaluations of two major cellular networks on three maps of different scales and locations, we show that NetNavi can significantly improve network access quality at low cost for mobile users, increasing the average download throughput by 67.5% for 67.6% source-destination pairs with only 11.4% extra travel delay (and as significant as 193.8% with only 3% extra travel delay in some cases). Our results, although preliminary, demonstrate the great potentials of improving network access quality for mobile users, without even changing network infrastructure or mobile applications.	access network;download;map;mobile app;network performance;software deployment;throughput	Cong Shi;Haiyong Xie	2013		10.1145/2505906.2505914	mobile search;geography;internet privacy;mobile computing;computer security;network delay;computer network	Mobile	-18.069196629207	76.8445312051947	170554
883eb0df64ac15f0fb19d832ed86ade9e8d25a6d	sgtp: smart grid transport protocol for secure reliable delivery of periodic real time data		In emerging smart grid networks, massive amounts of data will be continuously generated from measurement devices embedded in the power grid such as phasor management units (PMUs), intelligent electronic devices, advanced meters, or electric vehicle charging stations. Data generated from these measurement devices must be delivered immediately, reliably, and safely to specific locations for wide-area monitoring and grid control. The transport requirements for periodic measurement data are characterized as continual, reliable, and secure delivery of small-sized packets (less than 1.5 KB) over a utility-owned wide area network (WAN). Motivated by our assessment that no well-known transport protocol adequately meets these requirements, we designed the Smart Grid Transport Protocol (SGTP) for smart grid networking. Compared to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), we show through simulation studies that SGTP can indeed achieve lower latency while preserving reliability and lightweight communication overhead and supporting inherent security extensions.	android;anomaly detection;buffer overflow;computation;computer engineering;confidentiality;digital distribution;electrical engineering;embedded system;end-to-end principle;firmware;grid computing;hop-by-hop transport;ipsec;jÃ¶rg-rÃ¼diger sack;marina;maxima and minima;mega man network transmission;megabyte;mesh networking;network congestion;one-way function;overhead (computing);phasor;power-line communication;quasiperiodicity;radio frequency;reliable messaging;requirement;retransmission (data networks);router (computing);routing;simulation;ti msp430;technological convergence;telecommunications network	Young-Jin Kim;Marina Thottan	2011	Bell Labs Technical Journal	10.1002/bltj.20523	embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;operating system;computer security;computer network	Networks	-11.638258831996202	85.25682935526399	170753

The primary contribution of this paper is the functional architecture of the vertical layer which is primarily responsible for cross layer interaction management and optimization. The second contribution is the use of optimization cycle that comprises awareness parameters collection, mapping, classification and the analysis phases. The third contribution of the paper is the decomposition of the parameters into local and global network perspective for opportunistic optimization. We have shown through simulations how parameters' variations can represent local and global views of the network and how we can set local and global thresholds to perform opportunistic optimization. Finally, we conclude and highlight future challenges associated with the proposed framework.	global network;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;requirement;simulation;statistical classification	Murad Khalid;Ravi Sankar;In-ho Ra	2009	2009 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications	10.1109/ISCC.2009.5202361	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-12.600574892225914	87.61355015997357	170765

The paper makes two practical contributions.First, the paper highlights an important issue: all source of AS information are not the same. The paper utilizes three sources of information BGP tables, traceroute-based and archived information (WHOIS/IRR). The observed topo-logical properties are fairly different. A potential explanation could be that none of the sources captures the whole AS graph. Thus, the measurement community has more work to do to obtain a complete topology.Second, the paper critically analyzes the importance of the different topology metrics. The last six years have seen a proliferation of new metrics that are used in a selective fashion from researchers. This is one of the first thorough studies of most known metrics and on top of that many metrics that are used in related fields that also study networks (e.g. physics).In conclusion, this paper could become a reference point for making the analysis of the AS topology more systematic both in terms of making researchers: (a) aware of the differences among the datasets, and (b) careful in selecting metrics.	archive;border gateway protocol;emoticon;topo;traceroute	Michalis Faloutsos	2006	Computer Communication Review	10.1145/1111322.1111327	network management;computer science;data science;theoretical computer science;data mining;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-11.398395778166071	78.63965560647996	170878

The attention that SDN management obtained wasn't any less since traditional techniques were no longer sufficient for managing this new concept, and fully exploiting the flexibility and agility introduced with it. The purpose of this paper is to survey techniques used for network management for Software Defined Networks, and build on the FCAPS (Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security) model to propose a new management framework to serve SDN orchestration. Results showed an improvement of 27.5% for our proposed design as compared to the Controller-only and Manager-only scenarios.	software-defined networking	Sarah Abdallah;Imad H.

However, effective tools are lacking for analyzing the network performance and exploring the design choices for such emerging networks at scale. In this paper, we present visual analytics methods that couple data aggregation techniques with interactive visualizations for analyzing large-scale Dragonfly networks. We create an interactive visual analytics system based on these techniques. To facilitate effective analysis and exploration of network behaviors, our system provides intuitive, scalable visualizations that can be customized to show various traffic characteristics and correlate between different performance metrics. Using high-fidelity network simulation and HPC applications communication traces, we demonstrate the usefulness of our system with several case studies on exploring network behaviors at scale with different workloads, routing strategies, and job placement policies. Our simulations and visualizations provide valuable insights for mitigating network congestion and inter-job interference.	data aggregation;design space exploration;fat tree;interactivity;interference (communication);list of toolkits;network congestion;network performance;network topology;routing;scalability;simulation;tracing (software);tree network;visual analytics	Jianping Kelvin Li;Misbah Mubarak;Robert B.

We present a solution of the latter issue using the mathematical tools of Kronecker graphs.We are able to capture accurately the static structure of the overlay graph arising from a P2P streaming application. To validate our proposal, we use a large data set of a worldwide distributed measurement campaign arising from the live streaming system SopCast. First, we determine the basic parameters of our Kronecker graphs model by an EM-algorithm. Then we use it to generate a synthetic graph and compare the properties of both structures. The results of our analysis illustrate the coincidence of several graph-theoretical properties of the realized and synthetic overlay graph and underline the great potential of a modeling approach based on Kronecker graphs.	bittorrent;curve fitting;expectationâmaximization algorithm;file sharing;graph property;norm (social);peer-to-peer;streaming media;synthetic intelligence;theory;timeline	Udo R.

Placing the optimal content into local caches is crucial due to storage limitations, but it requires knowledge about the content popularity distribution, which is often not available in advance. Moreover, local content popularity is subject to fluctuations, since mobile users with different interests connect to the caching entity over time. Which content a user prefers may depend on the userâs context. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for context-aware proactive caching. The algorithm learns context-specific content popularity online by regularly observing context information of connected users, updating the cache content and observing cache hits subsequently. We derive a sublinear regret bound, which characterizes the learning speed and proves that our algorithm converges to the optimal cache content placement strategy in terms of maximizing the number of cache hits. Furthermore, our algorithm supports service differentiation by allowing operators of caching entities to prioritize customer groups. Our numerical results confirm that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in a real world data set, with an increase in the number of cache hits of at least 14%.	algorithm;cache (computing);differentiated service;digital distribution;entity;multi-armed bandit;multicast;numerical analysis;regret (decision theory);wireless router	Sabrina M&#x00FC;ller;Onur Atan;Mihaela van der Schaar;Anja Klein	2017	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2016.2636139	mobile telephony;telecommunications;cache;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;internet privacy;cache algorithms;world wide web;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-17.56895190617835	75.60118405856716	171481

Relatively little work considers leveraging this semantic information in the infrastructure to better serve the needs of clients and achieve better cost-effectiveness of infrastructure resources. In this paper, we identify semantics that can be derived and extracted from the various components in a content distribution infrastructure, namely content semantics (from content source), infrastructure semantics and client semantics (from content consumer). We develop a semantic-enhanced distribution and adaptation framework (SEDAN) that achieves superior efficiency and provides content access and adaptation features that were not previously possible	digital distribution;network media;server (computing)	Bo Shen;Zhichen Xu;Susie Wee;John G.

By reconfiguring the logical topology, network resources utilization can be optimized corresponding to the traffic pattern changes. From the viewpoint of network operation, the complexity of reconfiguration should be minimized as well. We consider the logical topology reconfiguration in arbitrary topology IP over WDM networks with balance between network performance and operation complexity. The exact formulation of the logical topology reconfiguration problem is usually given as a mixed integer linear programming, but it grows intractable with increasing size of network. Here we propose a simulated annealing approach to determine the target topology with a smaller logical topology change and satisfy the performance requirement. A threshold on the congestion performance requirement is used to balance the optimal congestion requirement and operation complexity by tuning this threshold to a feasible value. For an effective solution discovery, a two-stage SA algorithm is developed for multiple objectives optimization.	algorithm;integer programming;linear programming;logical topology;mathematical optimization;network congestion;network performance;simulated annealing;wavelength-division multiplexing	Sugang Xu;Kaoru Sezaki;Yoshiaki Tanaka	2004	11th International Telecommunications Network Strategy and Planning Symposium.

UCNs are characterized by spontaneous and grassroots deployments of wireless architectures, where users on such environments roam frequently and are also owners of networking equipment.

A worst-case model is considered where no blocking of lightpaths is allowed , and there are no assumptions made on the traac arrival and holding times. The traac is characterized only by its load L, which is the maximum number of light-paths that can be present on any link, assuming no blocking. A dynamic traac model is considered where requests to set up lightpaths arrive over time and must be accommodated without rerouting existing lightpaths, and lightpaths may be terminated over time as well. For networks without wavelength conversion, we show that at least 0:5L log 2 N + L wavelengths are required by any dynamic algorithm for rings of N nodes and present an algorithm that uses at most L log 2 N + L wavelengths for rings and 2(L ? 1) log 2 N for trees. We also study the worst-case behavior of the well known First-Fit algorithm and show it requires at most 2:53L log 2 N + 5L wavelengths (small variants of these constants are proven as well). When limited wavelength conversion is allowed, we rst show how to use expanders to insure no blocking in arbitrary topologies. Then we present conversion patterns for rings with conversion degree d = 2 which require L log 2 L + 4L or 2L log 2 log 2 L +	algorithm;best, worst and average case;bin packing problem;blocking (computing);dynamic problem (algorithms);wavelength-division multiplexing;whole earth 'lectronic link;worst-case complexity	Ori Gerstel;Galen H.

Still it supports the most important functionalities of BGP, and maintains the current Internet routing distribution model based on Inter-AS business relationships. The architecture is based on the knowledge of a static network graph formed by the Autonomous Systems (AS) and an algorithm to manage link failures. We use the concept of a region as a mechanism to sustain scale.

In this paper, the authors define one optimization problem whereby the service-to-hosting data center mapping is performed taking into account the available resources in both the data center (CPU cycles) and network (bandwidth) subsystems. The objective function of the optimization problem accounts for the amount of both CPU cycles and bandwidth, which are assigned to each requested service, with the assumption that the user's Quality of Experience (QoE) strictly depends only on these two factors. The problem is formulated using ILP and its numerical results are discussed to gain insights into the potential QoE gains that might result from using this cross layer (cooperative) resource assignment technique.	central processing unit;data center;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem	Wanjun Huang;Marco Tacca;Ning So;Miguel Razo;Andrea Fumagalli	2012	2012 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications	10.1109/ISPA.2012.77	joint;data center;real-time computing;integer programming;resource allocation;computer science;linear programming;distributed computing;software-defined networking;computer network	Arch	-11.114581908494761	81.81755315284431	172325

In this paper, we present a joint design which optimally deploys network functions and allocates physical resources satisfying end-to-end requests with generated routes. We first discuss the problem behind such design and show its NP-completeness. We then propose a mixed-integer program which simultaneously identifies physical nodes to be deployed with network functions and generates routes sharing common physical resources realizing end-to-end requests. Computational results demonstrate the value of the integrated approach and its ability to allocate network functions supporting end-to-end requests with limited physical resources.	computation;end-to-end principle;integer programming;linear programming;np-completeness;network function virtualization;proprietary hardware	Tachun Lin;Zhili Zhou;Massimo Tornatore;Biswanath Mukherjee	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417447	real-time computing;virtualization;cloud computing;computer science;noise measurement;resource management;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-11.296803204490825	81.77641406203041	172614

Besides, the lack of specific routing schema also restrains the advantages of NDN. To solve the problems of deployment and routing, we come up with the source routing schema over protocol-oblivious forwarding (POF) for NDN. POF is able to directly carry NDN packets without over IP because it provides an adaptable and programmable forwarding plane by defining a generic flow instruction set. Source routing is a flexible and scalable routing schema and provides the flexible and efficient implementation for the future network. The centralized management of the source routing schema over POF can provide the following properties: (i) quickly responding to the change of network, and (ii) forwarding the Interest packet to the best cache node. Experiments show that the source routing schema over POF for NDN can reduce more than 50% of the networking traffic flow and increase the cache hit rate by up to 25% more than the baseline schemas. Thus, the source routing schema over POF could be an implementation plan for NDN.	academy;baseline (configuration management);cache (computing);centralized computing;database schema;experiment;forwarding plane;network packet;reliability engineering;scalability;software deployment;source routing	Pufang Ma;Jiali You;Lingfang Wang;Jinlin Wang	2017	Journal of Network and Systems Management	10.1007/s10922-017-9445-9	computer science;computer network;information-centric networking;instruction set;cache;distributed computing;source routing;scalability;software-defined networking;network packet;forwarding plane	Networks	-13.171952639961729	82.21653402615549	172800

Given the open-group IP multicast service model, it is important to perform sender access control so as to prevent group members from receiving irrelevant data, and also protect the multicast tree from various Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Compared with source specific trees and uni-directional shared trees where information sources can be authorized or authenticated at the single root or Rendezvous Point (RP), in bi-directional trees this problem becomes challengeable since hosts can send data to the shared tree from any network point. In this paper we propose a scalable sender access policy mechanism for bi-directional shared trees so that irrelevant data is policed and discarded once it hits any on-tree router. We consider the scenario of both intra-domain and inter-domain routing in the deployment of the policy, so that the mechanism can adapt to situations in which large-scale multicast applications or many concurrent multicast sessions are involved, potentially across administrative domains.	access control;authentication;authorization;denial-of-service attack;downstream (software development);inter-domain;multicast;network packet;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;rp (complexity);relevance;router (computing);routing;scalability;simulation;software deployment;the open group	Ning Wang;George Pavlou	2001		10.1007/3-540-45546-9_11	multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;operating system;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;database;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;computer security;denial-of-service attack;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Networks	-5.3204883915446475	76.18728206606062	173060

QoS-aware multicast over WCNs is among the most challenging issues and has attracted a lot of attention in recent times. The existing multicast schemes in WCNs suffer in terms of several key performance metrics, such as, latency, jitter and throughput, particularly in large-scale networks. Consequently, these schemes cannot accommodate the desired performance levels, especially when dealing with high-bandwidth applications that require efficient gateway-based management. To fill in this gap, a new strategy for supporting QoS-aware multicast in large-scale WCNs is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a new Gateway based Multi-hop Routing algorithm (GMR) is firstly proposed to enhance the routing management capability of the network. Built upon GMR, a new Multicast Gateway Multi-hop Routing algorithm (MGMR) is devised to cope with high-bandwidth applications in WCNs. The MGMR is the first of its kind that considers both the capability of gateway-based management and the requirements of high-bandwidth applications. Extensive simulation experiments and performance results demonstrate the superiority of both GMR and MGMR when compared to other methods under various operating conditions.	algorithm;experiment;geographic coordinate system;inter-domain;multicast;quality of service;requirement;routing;simulation;throughput	Ahmed Yassin Al-Dubai;Liang Zhao;Albert Y.

This technique has reported number of implementations due to increasing interest in audiovisual technology and the capabilities of modern networks. However, multicast is still mystery for many programmers, network administrators and ordinary users who could make it more popular, and utilize this promising technique of transmission [1, 2, 11].

Some measurement studies recently have shown that the most important issue exposed by previous systems is how to balance the benefits between the internet service provider, the internet content provider, and P2P users. This issue is induced by little consideration on management and control. Other problems include how to resolve peers churn and make full use of network bandwidth and apply incentive mechanism among peers. In this work we introduce AHLSS, a P2P system for live streaming which is hierarchical, adaptive, and extendable. We present the architecture of AHLSS which is divided into three layers. The top layer named AP (Administrator Peer) overlay consisted of some authentic servers, which are arranged by ICP (Internet Content Provider) to provide enrollment and authentication for peers to join P2P overlay and start to watch a media channel. Every AP locates in an alliance alone. The middle layer is SP overlay. AHLSS divides peers that participate in data transmission into two classes, including SP and NP, which base on the capability of peers. SP is elected by AP. SP has responsibility to route media packets quickly and reply peers' channel request within the cluster. The under layer consists of many clusters. A cluster is formed by uniting peers which have poor capability and little stability near SP. SP is named cluster-head with the responsibility for management of members in the cluster. Our system's innovative features are the following: It provides the function of enrollment and authentication; AP look up peer's EnrollInfo (a list, which keeps the register information of peers) periodically and apply a decision-tree approach to elect SP. It resolves problems which are associated with the dynamics and heterogeneity of peers; to cope with the problem of topology-mismatch, we design Alliance and Cluster to partition the physical location of peers and make use of the Two-hop Detection Algorithm which belongs to LTM technology to optimize the connection of SP among alliances; different transmission modes are designed on SP overlay and within cluster. Native mesh-pull is adopted in SP overlay and the hybrid mode includes tree-push and mesh-pull which are applied in NP (Normal Peer) overlay. It reduces the delay in chunks transmitted through SP to NP and makes full use of the upload bandwidth of peers; Approach of K degree redundancy cluster-head is adopted by NP, it is used to avoid the inorganized status for NPs which resulted from SP's failure. In this paper, we describe in detail the main algorithms that stand behind the design of AHLSS and present the analysis of architecture for various aspects including adaptability, scalability, efficiency, and robustness.	extensibility	Runzhi Li;Chunyi Guo;Ming Fan;Zongmin Wang	2009	IJDSN	10.1080/15501320802498562	embedded system;computer science;peer-to-peer;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security	Arch	-13.233576032173934	74.8492094094942	173615

In large-scale networks such as data center networks, the scalability of a network is often limited by the SDN control plane because of a high flow arrival rate and uneven hotspot distribution. The objective of this paper is to design new mechanisms that utilize the computing resources in switches to scale up the SDN control plane without sacrificing the advantages of SDN. For this purpose, we propose the controller-proxy method, in which the SDN control plane can dynamically delegate a part of the event-processing logic to switches and utilize the computing resources in switches instead of handling OpenFlow events in the controllers. Experimental results show that controller-proxy method can reduce the workload of the control plane and improve the scalability of SDN networks by relieving the control path bottleneck.	software-defined networking	Ping Song;Yijing Liu;Tianxiao Liu;Depei Qian	2017	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2017.05.002	scalability;computer network;openflow;computer science;real-time computing;control theory;delegate;data center;network management;forwarding plane;software-defined networking;distributed computing	Networks	-13.652201319570207	81.89512981572136	173617

The first class of service, called Fully Protected (FP), offers end-users a guarantee of survivability in the case of a single failure; all FP traffic is protected using either a 1:1 or 1 + 1 protection scheme at the WDM layer. The second class of service, called Best-Effort Protected (BEP), is not protected; instead restoration at the IP layer is provided. When a failure occurs, the network restores as much BEP traffic as possible, and thus BEP traffic does not receive any specific guarantees. The FP service class mimics what Internet users receive today. The BEP traffic is designed to run over the large amounts of unused bandwidth that exist in todayâs Internet. The motivation of this approach is to give carriers a mechanism for increasing the load carried on backbone networks without reducing the QoS received by existing customers. In order to support two such services, the logical links at the IP layer need to be carefully mapped onto primary and backup paths at the optical layer. We incorporate into our mapping problem a number of practical requirements that reflect constraints that carriers face and policies they want to enforce. For example, we allow the FP demand to be specified via a traffic matrix at the IP layer, we include an overprovisioning factor that specifies the portion of each link that must be left unused, and we incorporate a minimal fairness requirement on how the BEP traffic is allocated among connections. Our goal is to quantify how much BEP traffic can be carried in addition to the FP traffic, without impacting the protection quality of the FP traffic even in the case of failure, and without impacting the FP load. We provide two solutions, one is an optimal solution using an Integer Linear Program (ILP) model, and the other is an algorithm based on the Tabu Search (TS) methodology. Our heuristic algorithm allows us to solve this problem for large networks such as those spanning the continental US. We show that by having two such classes of service, the load on a network can be increased by a factor of 4â7 (depending upon the network). We illustrate that even with overprovisioning and fairness requirements (both of which reduce the total possible BEP load carried), we can still typically triple the total network load. We show that the location of the bottleneck can affect whether or not we see a difference in performance between 1:1 or 1 + 1 protection schemes. Our results illustrate the gain in terms of additional BEP load carried that can be obtained simply due to the upgrade of a single link. Our proposal provides carriers a new vehicle for generating revenue by extracting benefit from all the sources of unused bandwidth in networks.	1:1 pixel mapping;admissible heuristic;algorithm;backup;bottleneck (software);british undergraduate degree classification;care-of address;circuit restoration;class of service;copy protection;denial-of-service attack;fairness measure;file spanning;first-class function;heuristic (computer science);internet backbone;interrupt;kÃ¶ppen climate classification;offset binary;optimization problem;provisioning;quality of service;requirement;router (computing);scalability;simulation;synchronous optical networking;tabu search;wavelength-division multiplexing	Antonio Nucci;Nina Taft;Patrick Thiran;Hui Zang;Christophe Diot	2005	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-005-4531-4	heuristic;best-effort delivery;network planning and design;real-time computing;telecommunications;tabu search;computer science;class of service;computer network	Networks	-9.907674155290145	82.60225791654418	173709

In the most common network architecture for home IoT, the devices use low-power wireless or WiFi to connect to an AP and access the Internet backend. We present a study on the feasibility and efficiency of an alternate network architecture for home IoT. In the proposed architecture, sensors and devices are directly attached to WiFi access points and utilize the computing resources of WiFi APs. We design and implement several sensing applications based on the proposed architecture and report on the performance and limitations of the approach. We find that the proposed architecture allows WiFi APs to become the computational, networking, and storage host for sensing applications without degrading the AP's primary function of providing Internet access to the home users.	beagleboard;central processing unit;cross compiler;input/output;internet access;internet of things;low-power broadcasting;network architecture;network performance;raspberry pi 3 model b (latest version);sensor;software development;wireless access point	Milad Heydariaan;Omprakash Gnawali	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842386	embedded system;the internet;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	-18.266127709189426	80.03185294132992	173907
8ddad68f3f57de957c63547d979a52c88d673d71	a network coding approach to in-band control traffic sharing in software defined networks		In-band southbound connectivity provides a cost-efficient way to share control traffic between the software-defined network controller and underlying forwarding devices; without having to worry about establishing and maintaining a separate transport network. However, the adoption of such a design also exposes the control plane traffic to non-negligible delay and losses; incurred from burdening a single transport network with an increased number of transmissions. These drawbacks can severely degrade network performance. For instance, when the requests in the form of control packets from switch-to-controller (or vice-versa) are dropped, the information may not get updated promptly and thus, the system would not behave as desired or in the worst case scenario can collapse altogether. To mitigate these constraints, in this paper, we propose the use of network coding which encourages information mixing as packets traverse the network. We show that network coding when applied to control plane traffic in an in-band design can help overcome losses due to congestion and link impairments. Evaluation results suggest that network coding aware in-band design can mitigate number of transmissions as well as total delay incurred by control packet losses.	control plane;cost efficiency;linear network coding;network congestion;network interface controller;network packet;network performance;northbound interface;software-defined networking;traverse;worst-case scenario	Fayaz Akhtar;Mubashir Husain Rehmani;Alan Davy	2018	2018 4th IEEE Conference on Network Softwarization and Workshops (NetSoft)	10.1109/NETSOFT.2018.8460027	transport network;traverse;linear network coding;computer network;network interface controller;in-band control;software-defined networking;network performance;network packet;computer science	Networks	-13.208243931522265	81.86353485233735	174165

Different kinds of network security policies are defined globally and distributed among multiple security middleboxes deployed in networks. However, due to the complexity of security policy, it is inefficient to directly employ existing path-wise enforcement approaches. This paper models the enforcement of network security policy as the set-covering problem, and designs a computational-geometry-based policy space analysis PSA tool for set operations of security policy. Leveraging the PSA, this paper first investigates the topological characteristics of different types of policies. This heuristic information reveals intrinsic complexities of security policy and guides the design of our enforcement approach. Then the paper proposes a scope-wise policy enforcement algorithm that selects a modest number of enforcement network nodes to deploy multiple policy subsets in a greedy manner. This approach can be employed on network topologies of both datacenter and service provider. The efficiencies of the PSA tool and the enforcement algorithm are also evaluated. Compared with the header space analysis, the PSA achieves much better memory and time efficiencies on set operations of security policy. Additionally, the proposed enforcement algorithm is able to guarantee network security within a reasonable number of enforcement network nodes, without introducing many extra rules.	algorithm selection;computational geometry;covering problems;data center;global network;greedy algorithm;heuristic;hyper-threading;middlebox;network packet;network security policy;network topology;polar surface area;python;set cover problem;the superficial	Xiuli Wang;Weiqi Shi;Yang Xiang;Jun Li	2016	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2015.2502402	computer security model;cloud computing security;algorithm design;routing;telecommunications;computer science;information security;network security;operating system;mathematical model;security service;distributed computing;network access control;network security policy;computer security;computer network	Security	-11.603927263534647	81.40649830015998	174200

This paper introduces a novel distributed control framework for shared protection in optical networks with reduced routing information based on the tropical semi-rings technique, called sharing with reduced information with tropical semi-rings (SRI-TROP). The design of the proposed framework aims to initiate a compromise between the amount of link-state dissemination and the performance impairment due to the incompleteness of routing information, such that the precision in the link-state matrix reconstruction can efficiently map to the reduction in blocking probability. Based on the framework, a series of novel schemes are proposed, which are verified and compared with the reported counterparts in a simulation. The simulation results show that the performance in terms of the precision in the reconstructed link-state and the resultant blocking probability can be significantly improved.	blocking (computing);distributed control system;erlang (unit);link-state routing protocol;maxima and minima;resultant;semiconductor industry;simulation;singular value decomposition	JÃ¡nos Tapolcai;Pin-Han Ho;Xiaohong Jiang;Susumu Horiguchi	2005	19th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA'05) Volume 1 (AINA papers)	10.1109/AINA.2005.310	theoretical computer science;distributed computing;matrix decomposition;group theory;singular value decomposition	HPC	-6.538071020880529	82.41186819458449	174460

A solution is to design a WMN using multiple wireless technologies. Since the optical spectrum remains unlicensed and under-utilized, we propose to augment RF WMNs with free space optical (FSO) systems. FSO links do not interfere with RF links and have higher capacity than RF links. In this paper, we study the throughput improvement of FSO-augmented RF WMNs. We address two questions. First, given a fixed number of FSO links, where should we install them to achieve the maximum improvement of network throughput for given traffic demands? Second, how do we route and schedule the flows in the hybrid FSO/RF network to achieve this throughput? We jointly formulate the above problems as one mixed integer linear programming problem. The results show that the throughput of the network increases dramatically by properly allocating FSO links. We also provide a computationally efficient algorithm to evaluate upper and lower bounds on the throughput of this hybrid FSO/RF network. The network administrator can use these bounds to determine the tradeoff between the number of FSO links (which are expensive) and the throughput improvement.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;integer programming;linear programming;maximum throughput scheduling;mesh networking;network topology;numerical analysis;radio frequency;routing;scheduling (computing);throughput;wireless mesh network	Yi Tang;MaÃ¯tÃ© Brandt-Pearce	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364576	wireless mesh network;integer programming;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;distributed computing;optical communication;computer network;broadband networks	Mobile	-5.368439140498847	82.31711547283383	174619

We develop energy cost formulations for our proposed protocols as well as the legacy BitTorrent. The performance of multi-proxy and private proxy BitTorrent is analyzed through a comprehensive set of simulations performed on Peersim for the energy consumption and average download time metrics. For the multi-proxy protocol, we investigate the effect of increasing the number of proxies on the overlay. We also present preliminary experimental results on large-scale scenarios revealing that the proxy-based schemes reduce the energy consumption up to 80% without any performance degradation in comparison to the legacy BitTorrent.	bittorrent;download;elegant degradation;simulation	Sena Cebeci;Ãznur Ãzkasap;Giuseppe Anastasi	2014	2014 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications	10.1109/NCA.2014.29	communications protocol;the internet;bittorrent;network switch;computer science;peer-to-peer;efficient energy use;internet privacy;world wide web;computer network	Arch	-15.028334796807323	76.18579088348808	175664

7fccf26529d3544b7cbf7b32ab0ad7237c487d41	does openflow really decouple the data plane from the control plane?		Software Defined Networks (SDNs) offer flexibility to current networks, allowing operators to manage network elements using software on an external server. SDNs are founded on a key feature: the separation of the control plane from the data plane. OpenFlow is the most popular SDN southbound interface today. However, does OpenFlow really decouple the data plane from the control plane? This is the leading question in this work. The literature has sought to quantity the impact of OpenFlow commands from control plane on data plane performance. Particularly, we argue that it is possible to damage the date plane by too many flow updates. Attackers, for instance, can use this effect in a cloud environment to reduce the performance of a collocated virtual network. However, it is not clear what is the exact impact of this coupling on production hardware and software switches. We investigate this through experiments, under representative scenarios, and propose a threshold mechanism to mitigate the effect of malicious administrators. We have observed that both hardware and software switches suffer from this limitation, presenting an average RTT degradation of up to 12.35% in the hardware switch, and 25.9% on the software switch. Finally, the proposed mechanism mitigates the lack of decoupling and malicious behavior.	computer hardware;control plane;coupling (computer programming);deep packet inspection;elegant degradation;experiment;forwarding plane;malware;model of computation;network packet;network performance;network switch;northbound interface;openflow;performance evaluation;server (computing);software-defined networking	Thiago M.

However, overlay applications bring to overlay fault diagnosis new challenges, which include large-scale deployment, inaccessible underlying network information, dynamic symptom-fault causality relationship, and multi-layer complexity. In this paper, we develop an evidential overlay fault diagnosis framework (called DigOver) to tackle these challenges. Firstly, the DigOver identifies a set of potential faulty components based on shared end-user observed negative symptoms. Then, each potential faulty component is evaluated to quantify its fault likelihood and the corresponding evaluation uncertainty. Finally, the DigOver dynamically constructs a plausible fault graph to locate the root causes of end-user observed negative symptoms.	causality;dependability;layer (electronics);overlay network;software deployment	Yongning Tang;Ehab Al-Shaer	2009	2009 IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems & Networks	10.1109/DSN.2009.5270328	reliability engineering;overlay network;cognition;uncertainty;computer science;graph theory;distributed computing;correlation;statistics;computer network	OS	-7.640006520449114	77.33412751924583	176118

Performance evaluation on converged network-Cloud service provisioning faces some new challenges that are brought in by key features of Cloud computing, such as resource virtualization and service-orientation. In order to address the challenges, we explored application of network calculus theory in analyzing network-Cloud service performance by proposing a novel profile-based modeling approach. In this paper we further extend this approach by particularly considering the impact of data transform between networking and computing systems in network-Cloud service provisioning, thus achieving holistic modeling and analysis on end-to-end service performance across the network and Cloud domains. The developed analytic method is general and applicable to a wide variety of network-Cloud services. The results obtained in this paper also provide useful guidelines for federated management of networking and computing resources for achieving service performance guarantees.	ab initio quantum chemistry methods;cloud computing;end-to-end principle;holism;itil;image scaling;lr parser;linear function;network calculus;network convergence;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;provisioning;scalability;service-orientation;technological convergence	Qiang Duan;Zhen Zheng	2014	2014 IEEE 28th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/AINA.2014.10	data modeling;real-time computing;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;cloud testing;distributed computing;utility computing;data as a service;computational model;converged infrastructure;provisioning;computer network	HPC	-13.794056514303005	86.58607614898857	176322

This algorithm is less complex and its calculation time is far below the time needed for other heuristics, e.g. one order of magnitude faster than the cyclic shift method. A second compact WLA algorithm that is based on formulas is proposed. The complexity of its implementation reduces to less than 15 lines of code.

However, there are still some obstacles on the way to the widespread adoption. Current commodity-off-the-shelf (COTS) SDN offerings are still in their infancy and are notorious for lacking standards compliance, scalability, and unpredictable performance indicators compared to their legacy counterparts. On the other hand, recent software-based solutions might mitigate these shortcomings, but in terms of cost-efficiency and port density they are in a lower league.  Here, we present HARMLESS, a novel SDN switch design that combines the rapid innovation and upgrade cycles of software switches with the port density of hardware-based appliances into a fully data plane-transparent, vendor-neutral and cost-effective solution for smaller enterprises to gain a foothold in this era. The demo showcases the SDN migration of a dumb legacy Ethernet switch to a powerful, fully reconfigurable, OpenFlow-enabled network device without incurring any major performance and latency penalty, nor any substantial price tag enabling to realize many use cases that would have otherwise needed standalone hardware appliances."""	algorithm;computer port (hardware);forwarding plane;network switch;networking hardware;openflow;scalability;software-defined networking;standards-compliant;telecommunications network	Mark Szalay;LÃ¡szlÃ³ Toka;GÃ¡bor RÃ©tvÃ¡ri;Gergely PongrÃ¡cz;Levente Csikor;Dimitrios P.

To watch a new channel, a node depends on the centralized server to join in the overlay of the channel. The increase in the number of channels in today's live streaming applications triggers users' desire of watching multiple channels successively or simultaneously. However, the support of such watching modes in current applications is no better than joining in different channel overlays successively or simultaneously, which if widely used, poses heavy burden on the centralized server. In order to achieve higher efficiency and scalability, we propose a Social network-Aided efficient liVe strEaming system (SAVE). SAVE regards users' channel switching or multi-channel watching as interactions between channels. By collecting the information of channel interactions and nodes' interests and watching times, SAVE forms nodes in multiple channels with frequent interactions into an overlay, constructs bridges between overlays of channels with less frequent interactions, and enables nodes to identify friends sharing similar interests and watching times. Thus, a node can connect to a new channel while staying in its current overlay, using bridges or relying on its friends, reducing the need to contact the centralized server. Extensive experimental results from the PeerSim simulator and PlanetLab verify that SAVE outperforms other popular protocols in system efficiency and server load reduction.	centralized computing;interaction;peer-to-peer;planetlab;scalability;server (computing);social network;streaming media;video overlay	Haiying Shen;Ze Li;Hailang Wang;Jin Li	2012		10.1145/2393347.2393387	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer network;social network	Security	-17.868525400609112	75.21913529383241	176812

In recent years, many research efforts in ICN have focused on caching strategies to reduce traffic and increase overall performance by decreasing download times. Since caches need to operate at line-speed, they have a limited size and content can only be stored for a short time. However, if content needs to be available for a longer time, e.g., for delay-tolerant networking or to provide high content availability similar to content delivery networks (CDNs), persistent caching is required. We base our work on the Content-Centric Networking (CCN) architecture and investigate persistent caching by extending the repository implementation in CCNx. We show by extensive evaluations in a YouTube and web server traffic scenario that repositories can be efficiently used to increase content availability by significantly increasing the cache hit rates.	b+ tree;b-tree;cache (computing);content delivery network;cyclomatic complexity;delay-tolerant networking;digital distribution;disk space;download;icn gps;network traffic control;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;queue (abstract data type);server (computing);sorting;spatial variability;telecommunications network;web server	Carlos Anastasiades;Andre S.

In this paper, we present a preliminary empirical study of end-to-end traffic patterns in data center networks that can inform and help evaluate research and operational approaches. We analyze SNMP logs collected at 19 data centers to examine temporal and spatial variations in link loads and losses. We find that while links in the core are heavily utilized the ones closer to the edge observe a greater degree of loss. We then study packet traces collected at a small number of switches in one data center and find evidence of ON-OFF traffic behavior. Finally, we develop a framework that derives ON-OFF traffic parameters for data center traffic sources that best explain the SNMP data collected for the data center. We show that the framework can be used to evaluate data center traffic engineering approaches. We are also applying the framework to design network-level traffic generators for data centers.	data center;end-to-end encryption;high- and low-level;network packet;network switch;simple network management protocol;tracing (software)	Theophilus Benson;Ashok Anand;Aditya Akella;Ming Zhang	2009		10.1145/1592681.1592692	traffic generation model;simulation;engineering;data mining;computer security	Metrics	-16.095632861899162	79.30272762306674	176994
01533600db0425140c261aaea68723ab0c45bb68	a network-assisted platform for multipoint remote learning		In the last few years, Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) have been introduced in the telecommunications world as a new way to design, deploy and manage networking services. Working together, they are able to consolidate and deliver networking components using standard IT virtualization technologies making, in such a way, Telco infrastructures more flexible and adaptive in respect to the needs of both end-users, Telco operators and service providers. In this context, this paper presents a softwarized architecture for a multipoint remote learning service, allowing network and application functions deployment simplification and management cost reduction. In such a way, the proposed architecture enables even small/medium learning service providers to organize tele-teaching courses without the need of adopting a dedicated and expensive data delivery infrastructure.

Content centric networking (CCN) has been proposed to address the challenges through ubiquitous in-network caching. While the expected benefits include higher performance and lower bandwidth consumption, CCN introduces new privacy issues at layer 3. This is because adversaries could infer the content consumed by others by checking cached data in routers. In this paper, we first analyze the design space to improve both caching performance and cache privacy for video delivery in CCN. In light of the observation that these two metrics need to be balanced, we propose CodingCache. It adopts network coding and random forwarding to exploit the potentials of multipath routing in CCN to improve both the diversity of cached content along different paths and the anonymity set for consumers. We evaluate CodingCache through extensive experiments based on a real-world topology and a unique data set of video access logs from a large-scale commercial video service. Our results demonstrate that, compared with the existing CCN strategies, CodingCache is able to increase the cache hit rate while also improve the use of caches across the network, together with reasonable cache privacy.	algorithm;cache (computing);cyclomatic complexity;digital video;experiment;icn gps;linear network coding;multipath propagation;multipath routing;network topology;privacy;prototype;router (computing);streaming media;tracing (software)	Qinghua Wu;Zhenyu Li;Gareth Tyson;Steve Uhlig;Mohamed Ali KÃ¢afar;Gaogang Xie	2016	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2016.2577321	routing;linear network coding;the internet;computer science;space exploration;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;measurement;computer network	Mobile	-15.187714324782192	75.65166067975309	177663

Such systems create Overlay Networks consisting of logical connections between end-systems at the edge of the Internet, do not require any supporting infrastructure, are scalable, and can be deployed using self-organization. However, the evolution of the Internet dramatically increases heterogeneity: NAT boxes establish different address spaces in different parts of the network. The partial transition from IPv4 to IPv6 leads to different protocols in the network layer and it is unsure whether all networked devices will use IP at all. These trends hinder direct connectivity between endsystems and, thus, make overlay deployment challenging. In this paper we survey on overlay approaches that can cope with these obstacles by providing themselves the functionality for homogeneous and persistent addressing and routing across heterogeneous networks. We discuss general approaches and trade-offs by example systems. Motivated by the lessons learned from these systems we present the Abstraction Base ariba, that implements shortest path routing across heterogeneous networks, maintains few neighborhood information, and requires low overhead for updates induced by network dynamics and node mobility.	fault tolerance;identifier;organizing (structure);routing;scalability;self-organization;shortest path problem	Oliver P.

It is important to make efficient use of all the available network capacity, using multiple physical paths whenever possible, but traditional forwarding mechanisms using a single path are not able to take advantages of available multiple physical paths. The state-of-the-art MPTCP (Multipath Transmission Control Protocol) solution uses multiple randomly selected paths, but cannot give total aggregated capacity. Moreover, it works as a TCP process, and so does not support other protocols like UDP. This paper presents an alternative solution using adaptive multipath routing in a Layer-2 network with static (capacity and latency) metrics, which adapts link and path failures. This solution provides in-network aggregated path capacity to individual flows, as well as scalability and multitenancy, by separating end-station services from the providerâs network. The results of deploying a proof-of-concept prototype on a data center testbed, which show the aggregated path capacity per flow, demonstrate an improvement of 14% in the worst bisection bandwidth utilization, compared to the MPTCP	bandwidth management;bisection bandwidth;data center;edge dominating set;encapsulation (networking);maximum flow problem;multipath propagation;multipath routing;multitenancy;network mapping;network packet;openflow;parallel building blocks;prototype;randomness;scalability;social network aggregation;testbed;throughput;virtual machine;weighted round robin	Tara Nath Subedi;Kim Khoa Nguyen;Mohamed Cheriet	2015	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2014.12.006	multipath propagation;openflow;routing;real-time computing;computer science;multipath routing;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-12.010978383327112	82.14654606828569	178081

This ring system offers better recovery control and path management than the conventional STM-based selfhealing ring. This self-healing ring has two main characteristics. First, protection VPâs are established in advance which have the same termination points as the working VPâs regardless of the types of path connection. Recovery is accomplished by connecting the working VPâs to their protection VPâs at nodes adjacent to the failure point. This restores a failed path without internode negotiation. This network, therefore, realizes a simple recovery scheme. Second, recovery is executed in the ATM VP layer. A function to detect and remove the endless looping cells is not needed. The proposed architecture permits the flexibility of VPâs to be applied to path management and recovery. The bandwidth of the protection VPâs can be shared and effective VPI assignment is achieved. The proposed ring network reliably supports various broadband services in a cost-effective manner.	atm turbo;ring network;software transactional memory;transport layer security	Yoshio Kajiyama;Nobuyuki Tokura;Katsuaki Kikuchi	1994	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.265716	ring network;real-time computing;cost-effectiveness analysis;data processing;adaptive control;telecommunications;data management;computer science;asynchronous communication;asynchronous transfer mode;reliability;ring;telecommunications network;computer network	Arch	-8.34122037943289	83.96835105676891	178185
4aba733a96370b18848d23e8a92f9daff3c41d96	layback: sdn management of multi-access edge computing (mec) for network access services and radio resource sharing		Existing radio access networks (RANs) allow only for very limited sharing of the communication and computation resources among wireless operators and heterogeneous wireless technologies. We introduce the LayBack architecture to facilitate communication and computation resource sharing among different wireless operators and technologies. LayBack organizes the RAN communication and multi-access edge computing (MEC) resources into layers, including a devices layer, a radio node (enhanced Node B and access point) layer, and a gateway layer. LayBack positions the coordination point between the different operators and technologies just behind the gateways and thus consistently decouples the fronthaul from the backhaul. The coordination point is implemented through a software defined networking (SDN) switching layer that connects the gateways to the backhaul (core) network layer. A unifying SDN orchestrator implements an SDN-based management framework that centrally manages the fronthaul and backhaul communication and computation resources and coordinates the cooperation between different wireless operators and technologies. We illustrate the capabilities of the introduced LayBack architecture and SDN-based management framework through a case study on a novel fluid cloud RAN (CRAN) function split. The fluid CRAN function split partitions the RAN functions into function blocks that are flexibly assigned to MEC nodes, effectively implementing the RAN functions through network function virtualization. We find that for non-uniform call arrivals, the computation of the function blocks with resource sharing among operators increases a revenue rate measure by more than 25% compared to the conventional CRAN where each operator utilizes only its own resources.	access network;backhaul (telecommunications);computation;edge computing;network function virtualization;serial digital video out;software-defined networking;transfer function;wireless access point	Florence R Wang;Akhilesh S.

Its event-based concept suggests the use of packet-based networks such as conventional Ethernet as underlying communication infrastructure. For such networks, however, proper Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms are required to ensure adequate network performance. Ideally, these mechanisms must be configured and controlled from the IEC 61499 system both during engineering and normal operation. This paper addresses the problem of fully integrating Ethernet switches into an IEC 61499 system rather than treating them as transparent network components. An analysis of existing QoS support in available devices reveals a large degree of heterogeneity in the implementations that calls for an abstraction layer. This abstraction is introduced by means of a dedicated QoS function block attached to the device which makes the QoS parameters accessible from the function block application layer thus making the device-specific implementation transparent to the IEC 61499 system developer.	abstraction layer;network packet;network performance;network switch;packet switching;quality of service	Aleksey Bratukhin;Thilo Sauter;Albert Treytl	2012	Proceedings of 2012 IEEE 17th International Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA 2012)	10.1109/ETFA.2012.6489689	local area network;embedded system;real-time computing;mobile qos;quality of service;data structure;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;common management information service;computer network	Embedded	-18.968015746476652	83.77700702915088	178221

In order to manage the heterogeneous networks efficiently and to solve the mismatching problem between the physical network and its P2P overlay, a membership management protocol for the P2P overlay in wireless mesh networks is proposedâ BA-gossip protocol. It combines scale-free network model (BA model) with gossip scheme. Decentralization and locally probability-preferential attachment are two key mechanisms in BA-gossip protocol. The BA-gossip protocol is abstracted into two mathematical models. To analyze the protocol performance in an ultimate state, BA-gossip growing network model is considered. To reflect the performance of real networks, BA-gossip evolving network model is considered. Through mean-field approach, BA-gossip growing network model is proved stable and scale-free. BA-gossip evolving network model is also proved stable by the same method. The simulation results show that both growing and evolving network models do not change the stability of BA model. The BA-gossip growing network model is more fault-tolerant than traditional BA model in complicated P2P network case. The simulation results also imply that both models solved the mismatching problem to a certain extent and are more appropriate in managing heterogeneous wireless mesh networks	mesh networking;peer-to-peer;wireless mesh network	Guo H.

Specifically, to minimize the cost and the energy footprint of the system, it uses the existing analog cable TV network as a communication substrate to connect Raspberry Pi end-hosts. The network stack is designed to operate over a largely unmodified broadcast-based coaxial network. The architecture is completely decentralized and can scale to hundreds of concurrent connections without requiring any backbone connectivity. To make smart use of the existing bandwidth, the video conferencing application uses multi-layered encoding and dynamically switches between selective retransmission and forward error correction based on the loss rate. Finally, the text-free user interface is simple enough to be used by low-literate users. To enable wider Internet connectivity, the architecture can easily be augmented using existing backbone technologies. While designed for direct communication between individuals, we also discuss how the same system can be used to enable community-based telemedicine and distance learning, among other applications.	error detection and correction;forward error correction;internet backbone;network switch;protocol stack;raspberry pi 3 model b (latest version);retransmission (data networks);selective repeat arq;text-free user interface	Zubair Nabi	2013		10.1145/2502880.2502886	simulation;developing country;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;multimedia;videoconferencing;computer network	Networks	-10.131723634230195	85.9728218468794	178355

7c089b372e74dd3404f6272c2d6ff7f770b66aa9	automated decision making based on pareto frontiers in the context of service placement in networks		Virtualization paradigms like cloud computing, software defined networking (SDN), and network functions virtualization (NFV) provide advantages with respect to aspects like flexibility, costs, and scalability. However, management and orchestration of the resulting networks also introduce new challenges. The placement of services, such as virtual machines (VMs), virtualized network functions (VNFs), or SDN controllers, is a multi-objective optimization task that confronts operators with a multitude of possible solutions that are incomparable among each other. The goal of this work is to investigate mechanisms that enable automated decision making between such multi-dimensional solutions. To this end, we investigate techniques from the domain of multi-attribute decision making that aggregate the performance of placements to a single numeric score. A comparison between resulting rankings of placements shows that many techniques produce similar results. Hence, placements that achieve good rankings according to many approaches might be viable candidates in the context of automated decision making. In order to illustrate the functionality of the different scoring mechanisms, we perform a case study on a single network graph and a fixed number of objectives and service instances. Additionally, we present aggregated results from broad evaluations on the Internet Topology Zoo and a larger number of objectives as well as varying numbers of service instances. These allow making more reliable statements about the mechanisms' performance and agreement.	aggregate data;algorithm;cloud computing;coefficient;heuristic;high-level programming language;internet topology;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;network function virtualization;orchestration (computing);pareto efficiency;scalability;software-defined networking;utility functions on indivisible goods;virtual machine	Michael Seufert;Stanislav Lange;Markus Meixner	2017	2017 29th International Teletraffic Congress (ITC 29)	10.23919/ITC.2017.8064350	computer science;computer network;orchestration (computing);virtualization;scalability;network topology;the internet;software-defined networking;cloud computing;virtual machine;distributed computing	Metrics	-12.19231316641463	81.56725795725458	178604

Network topology information is useful for network administration and planning. For examples, network problems, traffic bottlenecks, and other important information can be shown directly on the topology map such that a network administrator has a clear view of the current status of the network. The current topology information is also useful for planning new configuration when an expansion is needed. Entering the network topology information manually is a tedious task if the number of network devices is large. Therefore, a tool for generating the network topology automatically is desirable. In ATM networks, the values of VPI and VCI have only local significance. It does not explicitly reveal information about the source, destination, and path of the virtual connection. To find the source, destination, and path for the connection, one need to trace the VPIs and VCIs in the ATM switches. A tool for tracing the path of a virtual connection is useful.	atm turbo;automated planning and scheduling;network switch;network topology;simple network management protocol;virtual circuit	Hwa-Chun Lin;Chen-Sin Ye;Chuan-Ching Lin	1999		10.1109/INM.1999.770735	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;network topology;computer network	Networks	-19.03408660941313	84.3012279429025	178633

The simulation results usually depend on the topology layout, especially for routing and multicasting protocols. Therefore the topology used should be generated with the highest possible accuracy. In particular, protocols designed for the Internet should be simulated over Internet-like topologies. Many topology generators currently exist but the recent discovery of power laws in the Internet has brought new constraints upon the generated topologies. We introduce a flexible novel way to create Internet-like topologies. It is based on an algorithm that performs a sampling on a measured Internet map. The created topologies accurately comply with the newly found power laws as well as other more common topology properties such as the average path length.	algorithm;average path length;communications protocol;internet topology;multicast;network topology;routing;sampling (signal processing);simulation	Damien Magoni;Jean-Jacques Pansiot	2002		10.1109/ISCC.2002.1021797	power law;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network;logical topology	Networks	-8.24142754130568	78.71010349507984	179050

Existing virtual IP network deployment mechanisms do not allow for dynamic topology adaptation and fault-tolerance because provisioning of IP tunnels is performed only onceâwhen a virtual network is deployed. We propose a P2P-XBone, in which a P2P protocol such as DHT drives the topology and the routing table of a virtual IP network consistent with its neighbor node state. We describe how to extend both the existing X-Bone system and P2P mechanisms to achieve interworking between them. The P2PXBone not only provides P2Pâs characteristics such as self-organization, fault-tolerance and content-based routing to virtual IP networks but also provides higher forwarding performance and simpler implementation to P2P systems due to the support for the use of existing network services. We also show several results on the evaluation of overhead of P2P-driven provisioning and on forwarding performance. key words: virtual networks, peer-to-peer, DHT, dynamic topology control, routing	distributed hash table;fault tolerance;forwarding plane;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;provisioning;routing table;self-organization;software deployment;topology control;virtual ip address	Norihito Fujita;Joseph D.

SDN as a programmable network having âservice provisioning on the flyâ has induced a keen interest both in academic world and industry. In this article, a comprehensive survey is presented on SDN advancement over conventional network. The paper covers historical evolution in relation to SDN, functional architecture of the SDN and its related technologies, and OpenFlow standards/protocols, including the basic concept of interfacing of OpenFlow with network elements (NEs) such as optical switches. In addition a selective architecture survey has been conducted. Our proposed architecture on software defined heterogeneous network, points towards new technology enabling the opening of new vistas in the domain of network technology, which will facilitate in handling of huge internet traffic and helps infrastructure and service providers to customize their resources dynamically. Besides, current research projects and various activities as being carried out to standardize SDN as NGN by different standard development organizations (SODs) have been duly elaborated to judge how this technology moves towards standardization.	network switch;next-generation network;on the fly;openflow;optical switch;provisioning;software-defined networking	Sanjeev Singh;Rakesh Kumar Jha	2016	Journal of Network and Systems Management	10.1007/s10922-016-9393-9	world wide web;computer security;computer network	Networks	-15.37507425065603	85.77792535635601	179618

Based on Paris traceroute method of avoiding traceroute anomalies, this paper examines the practical feasibility of inferring forward IP paths by sending mixed TCP packets with other control bit(s) instead of SYN to a set of well-known websites.

13dd8db44f28d79654c9c3b179c7a12c8c4c0deb	information retention for disaster-affected networks using content-centric networking		Maintaining communication and information sharing in a disaster situation is a challenging task. A typical consequence of a natural disaster is that communication networks get fragmented. Consequently, information published in one fragment is no longer reachable by users in the other fragments. A number of approaches have been proposed to facilitate information retention in the network, most of them reactive, e.g. using data mules. In this paper we propose proactive measures to share information within the network before it becomes fragmented using Information-Centric Networking (ICN). We have developed a system, using the Content-Centric Networking (CCN) protocol, which proactively replicates content across different parts of the network by taking into account how the network will potentially fragment in the future. We demonstrate the content replication aspect of this system using 16 virtual CCN nodes distributed over 5 potential fragments called âCommunitiesâ.	cyclomatic complexity;data mule;icn gps;telecommunications network	Adeel Mohammad Malik;Elias Andersson;BÃ¶rje Ohlman	2018	2018 21st Conference on Innovation in Clouds, Internet and Networks and Workshops (ICIN)	10.1109/ICIN.2018.8401588	task analysis;information management;telecommunications network;computer network;information sharing;business;content centric networking	HPC	-12.005741474756425	84.20763770437749	180025

P2P network is used for file sharing, multiplayer online games, to avoid the expense and delay of traffic at the server. However, P2P communication has problems dealing with Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal. Based on the development of Hole Punching technique, the ability to across NAT can be easier and more convenient. Conventional Simple Traversal of UDP through NATs (STUN) protocol was given to discover the type of NATs behind Clients. In conventional STUN processing, the tests follow the sequence of time that means the first test is needed to get the result before performing the second test and so on. Thus, the system testing has the delay of time. So, in this paper, we propose an improved STUN algorithm that separating tests of the conventional STUN algorithm and perform all tests in parallel. So, the execution time will be shortened significantly. We also have reality experiment in which is applied improved STUN algorithm for testing NATs and then using UDP Hole Punching technique for establish P2P connection.	algorithm;computer;file sharing;nat traversal;network address translation;peer-to-peer;run time (program lifecycle phase);server (computing);system testing;tree traversal;udp hole punching	Tran Thi Thu Ha;Jaehyung Park;Yonggwan Won;Jinsul Kim	2014	2014 International Conference on IT Convergence and Security (ICITCS)	10.1109/ICITCS.2014.7021753	computer science;tcp hole punching;distributed computing;network address translation;world wide web;nat traversal;computer network	HPC	-12.899101936591192	75.00594047357262	180466
72b0d58c2b0aea23b6d0e8e0845427173de30bc7	research progresses and trends of onboard switching for satellite communications		As broadband satellite communication (SAT-COM) systems develop rapidly, Onboard Switching (OBS) technologies with flexible connectivity has attracted much attention by academic researchers and industry. However, due to the threat by the space radiation effects and the firm constraints of payload processing and power resources, OBS technologies are facing to great challenges in terms of its reliability and scalability. In the past literatures, in order to improve the connectivity and reliability of the single-path Crossbar switch, the multi-path Clos network is widely investigated for preferable adoption in OBS. Nevertheless, due to the extensive use of centralized scheduling, the current Clos network with low scalability is not applicable for high-throughput OBS systems. In this paper, by analyzing progresses and trends of decades of related researches, the developing directions of OBS are provided and discussed, combining the switching architecture, the queuing strategy and the corresponding scheduling algorithms. By employing specific queuing structure to sup-port distributed scheduling in the Clos network and along with distributed, fault-tolerant scheduling algorithms, the requirements for high scalability and fault tolerance of the OBS systems can be efficiently guaranteed, which is expected to be a new trend of OBS researches.	communications satellite	Wanli Chen;Kai Liu;Xiang Chen	2016		10.1007/978-981-10-4403-8_11	meteorology;aeronautics	Robotics	-9.975323316575942	84.98372402604012	180574
85cc9339e3f875f56bab46b0c8062a043b32d323	video service recovery mechanism based on quality of experience-aware in hybrid wireless-optical broadband-access network		A video service recovery mechanism based on quality of experience (QoE) aware is proposed to unambiguously evaluate the quality of video service and recover the unacceptable video service in hybrid wireless-optical broadband-access network (WOBAN). The QoS parameters are modeled to the objective metric of QoE. Furthermore, the objective metric of QoE is mapped to the subjective MOS value. And the unacceptable video service is recovered by searching for a recovery routing which has better QoE. The recovery rerouting problem is divided to the subproblem of selecting the object mesh portal point and the subproblem of searching the alternate routing. The object mesh portal point is selected by the basis of load balance. And the subproblem of searching alternate routing is addressed by the Dijkstra mechanism to find the path which can provide the best QoE for the video service. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism can effectively improve the quality of video services.	access network	Hong Zhang;Ruyan Wang;Hui Liu	2018	MONET	10.1007/s11036-017-0971-1	computer network;service recovery;quality of service;computer science;wireless;real-time computing;access network;quality of experience;broadband;load balancing (computing);dijkstra's algorithm	HPC	-6.1855062016967555	82.80584119547709	180618

48fe28a6814624c768ae1b3c924b68b8ddf76839	metron: nfv service chains at the true speed of the underlying hardware		In this paper we present Metron, a Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) platform that achieves high resource utilization by jointly exploiting the underlying network and commodity serversâ resources. This synergy allows Metron to: (i) offload part of the packet processing logic to the network, (ii) use smart tagging to setup and exploit the affinity of traffic classes, and (iii) use tag-based hardware dispatching to carry out the remaining packet processing at the speed of the serversâ fastest cache(s), with zero intercore communication. Metron also introduces a novel resource allocation scheme that minimizes the resource allocation overhead for large-scale NFV deployments. With commodity hardware assistance, Metron deeply inspects traffic at 40 Gbps and realizes stateful network functions at the speed of a 100 GbE network card on a single server. Metron has 2.75-6.5x better efficiency than OpenBox, a state of the art NFV system, while ensuring key requirements such as elasticity, fine-grained load balancing, and flexible traffic steering.	commodity computing;data rate units;elasticity (data store);fastest;load balancing (computing);network function virtualization;network interface controller;network packet;overhead (computing);processor affinity;requirement;server (computing);state (computer science);synergy	Georgios P.

Our scheme was designed with widely available, low-cost WLAN equipment in mind. Thus, we wish to estimate the performance penalty our proposed mechanisms incur for such devices and study their limitations as to the support for secure data and multimedia communications. In this work, we measure the maximum number of simultaneous voice calls that a P2PWNC-enabled access point can sustain, and the TCP throughput achieved by a single mobile station in the presence of simultaneous TCP flows by other P2PWNC users, when IPsec is employed to secure communications.	access network;experiment;ipsec;mind;secure communication;secure voice;throughput;wireless access point	Pantelis A.

Future Personal Communication Systems (PCS) will support a huge user population and o network spanning a large geographical area. In such systems, the signaling trafic and processing overhead for locating mobile users is expected to increase dramatically. In a mobile computing environment, mobile hosts move f iom one place to another and need to access the information without interruption, regardless of their location. This is the reason why location management is one of the important issues in mobile computing environments. Several techniques have been proposed in order to optimally manage the location of mobile hosts. In this paper, we introduce a probabiliw-based location management (PBLM) algorithm which is based on no0 previously introduced algorithms to locate a user optimally: FBFind and FVLF. The basic idea of using PBLM algorithm is to reduce the Signaling System No. 7 ($37) message trafic and database access trofic by maintaining a local database. which is called Location Information Database (LID) and is to reuse the information of mobile hosts' mobility patterns. We evaluate this algorithm and identify its optimal conditions as well as limitations. Results indicate that reusing mobile hosts ' mobility information in local databases can save great deal of the updating costs.	algorithm;cell signaling;database;file spanning;geographic coordinate system;interrupt;location-based service;mobile computing;overhead (computing);signalling system no. 7	Seung-yun Kim;Waleed W.

This network has two unique features. First, only one light source, called the multi-carrier light source, is required which eases the difficulty of controlling many light source devices. Second, optical carriers are reused in order to improve the efficiency of wavelength usage. Given the target of wavelength-resource-efficient channel establishment, performance of the heuristic RWA scheme is evaluated. To realise efficient wavelength usage, the authors formulate the RWA problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem of obtaining the minimum number of required wavelengths for given requests. With the ILP approach, the calculation process is not tractable in practical time. The heuristic RWA scheme introduced in this study solves the RWA problem. This scheme consists of two algorithms. Channel routes are obtained by the routing algorithm, and the wavelength assignment algorithm is then performed to assign a wavelength to each route. Moreover, two candidates, considering the shortest path and considering the avoidance of wavelength conversion, for the routing algorithm are examined. Numerical results show that the first candidate is more suitable in terms of reducing the number of required wavelengths than the second candidate.	optical carrier transmission rates;ring network;routing and wavelength assignment	M.

In SDH/SONET multi layer networks, client layer SDH/SONET connections are groomed to wavelength channels and transported using end-to-end lightpaths. Also, intermediate grooming can yield to a more efficient utilization of network resources. In contrast to many other IP-overWDM network architectures, a clear and efficient evolutionary path exists to upgrade todays SDH/SONET networks based on point-to-point WDM links to dynamic SDH/SONET-WDM networks. In this paper, two principal SDH/SONET-WDM multi layer network architectures are investigated covering the dynamics either only in the electrical layer or in both layers, respectively. We present a detailed performance evaluation based on simulation studies and compare both architectures for different total network capacity and grooming strategies in order to show benefits and drawbacks for the introduction of dynamics in the optical plane of todays backbone networks.

84a602b8560b270ea5311236be5de453e9e7a3ff	a lightweight approach for improving the lookup performance in kademlia-type systems		Discovery of nodes and content in large-scale distributed systems is generally based on Kademlia, today. Understanding Kademlia-type systems to improve their performance is essential for maintaining a high service quality for an increased number of participants, particularly when those systems are adopted by latency-sensitive applications. This paper contributes to the understanding of Kademlia by studying the impact of diversifying neighboursâ identifiers within each routing table bucket on the lookup performance. We propose a new, yet backward-compatible, neighbour selection scheme that attempts to maximize the aforementioned diversity. The scheme does not cause additional overhead except negligible computations for comparing the diversity of identifiers. We present a theoretical model for the actual impact of the new scheme on the lookupâs hop count and validate it against simulations of three exemplary Kademlia-type systems. We also measure the performance gain enabled by a partial deployment for the scheme in the real KAD system. The results confirm the superiority of the systems that incorporate our scheme.	backward compatibility;computation;distributed computing;identifier;kad network;lookup table;overhead (computing);routing table;simulation;software deployment;sven jaschan;theory;type system	Hani Salah;Stefanie Roos;Thorsten Strufe	2014	CoRR		computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;world wide web;computer network	Metrics	-13.920485818215864	75.00193656004751	181542

Traditional Big Data approaches run into limitations even as they push scale boundaries for processing data further. One reason for this is the fact that in many cases, the bottleneck for analytics is not analytics processing itself but the generation and export of the data on which analytics depends. The amount of data that can be reasonably collected from the network runs into inherent limitations due to bandwidth and processing constraints in the network itself. In addition, management tasks related to determining and configuring which data to generate lead to significant deployment challenges. In order to address these issues, we propose a novel distributed solution to network analytics. Analytics processing is performed at the source of the data by specialized agents embedded within network devices, which also dynamically set up and reconfigure telemetry data sources as required by an analytics task. An SDN controller application orchestrates network analytics tasks across the network to allow users to interact with the network as a whole instead of individual devices one at a time.

AggFlow is intended to provide complete address virtualization while incurring low overhead for physical switches and the control channel. To reduce overhead of address virtualization, we propose mapping-less address virtualization. We additionally introduce hop-by-hop-based forwarding, which aggregates flow rules installed in physical switches. This leads to efficient use of ternary content addressable memory and bandwidth of the control channel. Our evaluation using Mininet with simple linear and tree topologies, the flow table size of the core switch is reduced up to 1/16 for both topologies, and the control channel traffic decreases by 51% and 29% respectively.

Hence, an efficient cache management scheme is essential for effective content distribution and high cache utilization. As a new cache management scheme, this paper proposes the sharing of cache summaries with neighboring routers to increase the diversity of cached contents in NDN. Our proposed scheme defines a summary packet using a Bloom filter and a method to share the summary. When a  Data  packet is received, a router makes the decision of whether or not to save the  Data  depending on query results of the cache summaries of neighboring routers. If any of the neighboring routers have the  Data , the  Data  has not necessarily been saved. When an  Interest  packet is received, a router can forward the  Interest  to a neighboring router that has the requested content by checking the summaries. The proposed scheme is evaluated using ndnSIM, which is an NS-3 based Named Data Networking simulator. Simulation results show that the sharing of cache summaries enhances the content diversity and accordingly the cache hit ratio, and reduces the average content delivery time.	bloom filter	Ju Hyoung Mun;Hyesook Lim	2017	J.

Many valuable applications have been recently built on top of several available DHTs. However, they function poorly when no direct IP connectivity is available to some nodes (e.g., located behind a NAT or firewall) or in the presence of overloaded or malicious nodes. In this paper, we propose a new method for DHT-based routing called cyclic routing. It generalizes existing single-hop look-ahead approach (also known as âKnow thy neighbor's neighborâ) and supports multipath routing. The method provides a systematic way for collecting stable and efficient overlay paths. Cyclic routing has the same theoretical dependability and efficiency upper bounds as basic DHT routing but it is more resilient when IP connectivity is limited or when the overlay suffers from overloaded nodes.	algorithm;dependability;distributed hash table;failure rate;firewall (computing);global network;internet;link-state routing protocol;lookup table;multipath routing;network address translation;network packet;overlay network;parsing;peer-to-peer;reachability;routing table;shortest path problem;simulation	Dmitry G.

Connection blocking is an inherent attribute and influences optical networksâ performance, especially in multi-domain network scenarios. We analyze the reason and effect of blockings including routing blockings and signaling blockings. We regard the cause of signaling blockings as the information asynchronization in resource reservation process. We define the concept of Information Asynchronization Period to describe the effect of signaling blockings. To reduce signaling blockings in end-to-end optical path provisioning for multi-domain scenarios, we propose a novel network routing and control scheme, named Intra-Domain Immediate Reroute based Semi-Proactive Hierarchical Path Computation Element (IDIRSP H-PCE). The proposed routing and control scheme mainly consists of two parts, Semi-Proactive routing and Intra-Domain Immediate Reroute mechanism. Dynamic network simulations verify our proposed scheme. We compare the network performance with Reactive Backward Recursive PCE-based Computation (BRPC) based PCE, Reactive H-PCE and Proactive H-PCE. Simulation results indicate that IDIRSP H-PCE can provide connection with a very low blocking probability in light load case, which is close to Proactive H-PCE, and obviously better than BRPC based Reactive PCE and Reactive H-PCE. For heavy load case, IDIRSP H-PCE has a remarkably lower blocking probability than other three methods. Moreover, we test our proposed routing and control scheme when facing link faults. Simulation results indicate that IDIRSP H-PCE can greatly improve the traffic access rate and optimize the network performance.	blocking (computing);computation;end-to-end principle;erlang (unit);ip address blocking;inter-domain;microtransaction;network performance;optical fiber;proactive network provider participation for p2p;provisioning;recursion (computer science);routing;semiconductor industry;simulation;state (computer science)	Yinqiu Jia;Nan Hua;Yanhe Li;Xiaoping Zheng	2016	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-016-0654-z	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-7.10439764522256	82.95641745489814	182778
345c482310fcb4d37bf53551c49ef10ffcc67029	pantheon: the training ground for internet congestion-control research		Internet transport algorithms are foundational to the performance of network applications. But a number of practical challenges make it difficult to evaluate new ideas and algorithms in a reproducible manner. We present the Pantheon, a system that addresses this by serving as a community âtraining groundâ for research on Internet transport protocols and congestion control (https: //pantheon.stanford.edu). It allows network researchers to benefit from and contribute to a common set of benchmark algorithms, a shared evaluation platform, and a public archive of results. We present three results showing the Pantheonâs value as a research tool. First, we describe a measurement study from more than a year of data, indicating that congestioncontrol schemes vary dramatically in their relative performance as a function of path dynamics. Second, the Pantheon generates calibrated network emulators that capture the diverse performance of real Internet paths. These enable reproducible and rapid experiments that closely approximate real-world results. Finally, we describe the Pantheonâs contribution to developing new congestioncontrol schemes, two of which were published at USENIX NSDI 2018, as well as data-driven neural-network-based congestion-control schemes that can be trained to achieve good performance over the real Internet.	approximation algorithm;archive;benchmark (computing);communications protocol;computer science;computer vision;distributed computing;elementary os;emulator;experiment;https;ibm tivoli storage productivity center;imagenet;internet;machine learning;network congestion;system of measurement	Francis Y.

Thus, it is critical to understand the energy consumption and improve the power efficiency of Data Center Networks (DCNs). In doing so, one straightforward and effective way is to make the size of DCNs elastic along with traffic demands, i.e., turning off unnecessary network components to reduce the energy consumption. Today, Software Defined Networking (SDN), as one of the most promising solutions for data center management, provides a paradigm to elastically control the resources of DCNs. However, to the best of our knowledge, the features of SDN have not been fully leveraged to improve the power saving, especially for largescale multi-controller DCNs. To address this problem, we propose EMC, a mechanism to improve DCNâs Energy Efficiency via the Elastic Multi-Controller SDN. In EMC, the energy optimizations for both forwarding and control plane are considered by utilizing SDNâs fine-grained routing and dynamic control mapping. In particular, the flow network theory and the bin-packing heuristic are used to deal with the forwarding plane and control plane, respectively. Our simulation results show that EMC can achieve more efficient power management, especially in highly structured topologies such as Fat-Tree and BCube, by saving up to 50% of network energy, at an acceptable level of computation cost.	aggregate data;bin packing problem;computation;control plane;daemon (computing);data center;dynamic circuit network;elasticity (data store);fat tree;file allocation table;flow network;forwarding plane;heuristic;network theory;performance per watt;power management;programming paradigm;reliability engineering;routing;scalability;server (computing);set packing;simulation;software-defined networking;usability	Kun Xie;Xiaohong Huang;Shuai Hao;Maode Ma;Pei Zhang;Dingyuan Hu	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2617871	data center;routing;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;software-defined networking;efficient energy use;low-power electronics;computer network;energy management	Networks	-10.198912759113234	81.96519070336208	183102

Each of the demands protected from two failures is assigned two restoration routes and restoration wavelengths on a cycle. A demand protected from a single failure is assigned one restoration route and restoration wavelengths on a cycle. These assignments are preconfigured so that switching and wavelength conversions are not needed at intermediate nodes of restoration routes. Splitting of demand across multiple restoration routes upon a failure occurrence is not allowed. The algorithm generates a large number of candidate Path-Protecting Preconfigured Cycles (PP-PCs). A candidate cycle may provide protection to a mix of demands requiring different protection levels, where demands may share under certain conditions restoration wavelengths even if they are exposed to common failure scenarios and have overlapping restoration routes. A near-optimal set of preconfigured cycles is selected from among all candidates, attempting to minimize the total cost of restoration wavelengths while ensuring that each demand is assigned to a single preconfigured cycle. This is achieved by solving a set covering problem followed by deleting duplicate demand assignments and by resolving wavelength assignment conflicts.	circuit restoration	Martin I.

Content-centric networking, cloud services, and open connectivity form the main ingredients of the future Internet architecture. With the problem of information overload, the networking paradigm of cloud computing can benefit from transitioning to a network of information in which information is the main token of communication instead of physical address. Available methods may not be efficient in exploiting the semantics of information for content dissemination. Considering a content-centric approach, we intend to tackle this problem by using the expander graphs for an enhanced network coding scheme that takes an opportunistic strategy to utilize the spectral characteristics of the network topology to achieve a better solvability and reliability and lowering the processing cost for the entire system. By simulation and analytical evaluation, we compare our proposed method with an epidemic network coding based approach. Our evaluation examines the performance of our clustering method in the presence of different random topology models as well as examining the impact on the network coding technique.	cloud computing;cluster analysis;computational complexity theory;digital distribution;future internet;information overload;linear network coding;network topology;physical address;programming paradigm;requirement;scalability;sensor;simulation	Peyman TalebiFard;Victor C.

8d69cba4fff73c8af50ab8873c71f9c7b4efcadc	nfaas: named function as a service		In the past, the Information-centric networking (ICN) community has focused on issues mainly pertaining to traditional content delivery (e.g., routing and forwarding scalability, congestion control and in-network caching). However, to keep up with future Internet architectural trends the wider area of future Internet paradigms, there is a pressing need to support edge/fog computing environments, where cloud functionality is available more proximate to where the data is generated and needs processing.  With this goal in mind, we propose Named Function as a Service (NFaaS), a framework that extends the Named Data Networking architecture to support in-network function execution. In contrast to existing works, NFaaSbuilds on very lightweight VMs and allows for dynamic execution of custom code. Functions can be downloaded and run by any node in the network. Functions can move between nodes according to user demand, making resolution of moving functions a first-class challenge. NFaaSincludes a Kernel Store component, which is responsible not only for storing functions, but also for making decisions on which functions to run locally. NFaaSincludes a routing protocol and a number of forwarding strategies to deploy and dynamically migrate functions within the network. We validate our design through extensive simulations, which show that delay-sensitive functions are deployed closer to the edge, while less delay-sensitive ones closer to the core.	computation;digital distribution;edge computing;fog computing;function as a service;future internet;icn gps;kernel (operating system);microservices;network congestion;openvms;out-of-order execution;prototype;routing;scalability;seamless3d;simulation;stateless protocol;transfer function;windows legacy audio components	Michal KrÃ³l;Ioannis Psaras	2017		10.1145/3125719.3125727	distributed computing;computer science;computer network;network architecture;scalability;network congestion;cloud computing;the internet;information-centric networking;mobile edge computing;routing protocol	Networks	-14.568156692407245	82.7858182048646	183678
fd642d463d3d231f7be96ffe4fce00ae5ce4116c	oasis: a mobile cyberâphysical system for accessible location exploration		Users roaming cellular signal coverage with their mobile devices essentially form a mobile cyberâphysical system (CPS). By modeling cyber human mentality and physical signal coverage, as well as their interplay, user mobility can be leveraged to improve usersâ mobile experience with limited wireless bandwidth. Through a real-world case study, we observed that numerous ânull zonesâ and âhot zonesâ exist in cellular signal coverage areas, where mobile devices cannot obtain sufficiently high data rates for delay-sensitive applications. Over one third of the locations in a crowded area could have weak signal coverage and low bandwidth shares, resulting in poor mobile connectivity experience. This paper considers the practicality of a mobile CPS called Oasis, which guides users to leave those zones and move to nearby locations with better mobile experience. To realize the system, we model and maximize a userâs willingness to travel to another location, where the willingness involves the compound impact of the travel distance and the improved perceptual quality. We also develop a prototype system that creates a feedback control loop to allow self-adaptation to usersâ needs. To evaluate the efficacy, we conducted a series of experiments based on the real data collected in downtown Taipei, Taiwan. The results demonstrate that our mobile CPS can further reduce the average distance per unit of quality improvement achieved with OpenSignalMaps by about 80%, and motivate further research.	control system;experiment;feedback;mobile device;prototype	Chih-Chuan Cheng;Pi-Cheng Hsiu;Ting-Kuei Hu;Tei-Wei Kuo	2018	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2018.2817511	cyber-physical system;wireless;telecommunications link;computer network;roaming;mobile device;bandwidth (signal processing);business;base station;cellular network	Mobile	-18.365972277812954	76.85646467916477	183743

Such communications are often time sensitive and prone to disruptions or unacceptable latency because of the high variability of Internet traffic and capacity across the network. Self-aware networks offer mesh networking facilities with adaptive routing able to cope with changes in network conditions, such as variations in traffic load and link or node failure. Further quality improvement can be achieved by relaying critical application tasks to software agents able to migrate to alternate hosts and take advantage of new location facilities for their communications. The paper examines the concurrent use of self-aware networking and software agent mobility to offer improved communication facilities to time-critical group communications. A host selection algorithm for agent migration is proposed to find suitable locations for agents and evaluated in a simulation study.	centralisation;coloured petri net;distributed computing;heart rate variability;internet;mesh networking;mobile agent;quality of service;routing;selection algorithm;self-awareness;simulation;software agent;window of opportunity	Ricardo Lent	2008			temperature control;data mining;synthetic crude;peat;mobile agent;computer science;waste management;carbonization;coal;carbon;asphalt	Metrics	-9.901471355331363	79.70999663087456	183779

However the centralized control of entire network may trigger large overhead and limit the scalability of control plane. In this paper, we propose an enhanced mechanism of elephant flow scheduling in SDN-based data center. The mechanism can efficiently reduce the overhead and improve the scalability of control plane by using Parametric Minimum Cross Entropy (PMCE) algorithm. We describe the proposed approach in detail, and evaluate it in OMnet++ to verity its feasibility and effectiveness. Numerical results show that the benefits of our scheme are better than previous methods and the extra delay caused by PMCE algorithm is controllable.	algorithm;centralized computing;control plane;cross entropy;data center;elephant flow;max-flow min-cut theorem;overhead (computing);scalability;scheduling (computing);software-defined networking	Zehui Liu;Deyun Gao;Ying Liu;Hongke Zhang	2016	2016 IEEE 84th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7880900	entropy;real-time computing;scalability;the internet;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;scheduling;bandwidth;computer network	HPC	-10.67567302478836	82.33464856215949	184083

The objective is to spare extra capacity for the primary path of a traffic aggregate (flow) by accommodating excess traffic on its backup path. The contribution of the paper is manyfold. We explain existing OpenFlow features for traffic monitoring and dynamic flow splitting, combine them to implement load-dependent balancing of a flow's traffic on its primary and backup paths, and propose three different load-dependent flow splitting (LDFS) policies. We develop a performance evaluation method to quantify the capacity for load-balancing and protection switching methods such that expected traffic can be accommodated for envisioned overload and failure scenarios. Finally, we assess the usefulness of LDFS by comparison with traffic-agnostic single- or multipath forwarding methods.	aggregate data;backup;batch file;failover;link-state routing protocol;load balancing (computing);minkowski portal refinement;multipath propagation;offset binary;openflow;performance evaluation;resolution enhancement technology;shortest path problem;tree rearrangement;wrapper function	Wolfgang Braun;Michael Menth	2015	2015 International Conference and Workshops on Networked Systems (NetSys)	10.1109/NetSys.2015.7089060	real-time computing;engineering;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-10.840599275809245	83.17064749174523	184316

Following this paradigm, a novel software-defined radio access network (SDRAN) architecture and the function modules have been proposed in this paper. In particular, the motivation, challenge, and deployment roadmap of SDRAN framework are discussed. The relationships between alternative solutions (Cloud RAN, network function virtualization) and complementary technologies (cognitive radio, self-organizing network, big data analysis) are analyzed in detail. Taking interference management of heterogeneous mobile network as the example use case, scheme design and preliminary system evaluations are given to show the benefit of SDRAN architecture.	big data;c-ran;centralized computing;cognitive radio;control function (econometrics);fifth generation computer;high- and low-level;interference (communication);network function virtualization;next-generation network;organizing (structure);programming paradigm;radio access network;scalability;self-organization;software deployment;software-defined networking;transfer function	Fangmin Xu;Haipeng Yao;Chenglin Zhao;Chao Qiu	2016	EURASIP J.

Unfortunately, traditional Internet technologies have been designed around the restrictive assumption of a single working path between a source and a destination. The lack of native multipath support constrains network performance even as the underlying network is richly connected and has redundant multiple paths. Computer networks can exploit the power of multiplicity, through which a diverse collection of paths is resource pooled as a single resource, to unlock the inherent redundancy of the Internet. This opens up a new vista of opportunities, promising increased throughput (through concurrent usage of multiple paths) and increased reliability and fault tolerance (through the use of multiple paths in backup/redundant arrangements). There are many emerging trends in networking that signify that the Internet's future will be multipath, including the use of multipath technology in data center computing; the ready availability of multiple heterogeneous radio interfaces in wireless (such as Wi-Fi and cellular) in wireless devices; ubiquity of mobile devices that are multihomed with heterogeneous access networks; and the development and standardization of multipath transport protocols such as multipath TCP. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of the literature on network-layer multipath solutions. We will present a detailed investigation of two important design issues, namely, the control plane problem of how to compute and select the routes and the data plane problem of how to split the flow on the computed paths. The main contribution of this paper is a systematic articulation of the main design issues in network-layer multipath routing along with a broad-ranging survey of the vast literature on network-layer multipathing. We also highlight open issues and identify directions for future work.	access network;backup;biconnected component;control plane;data center;fault tolerance;forwarding plane;holism;internet;mobile device;multihoming;multipath propagation;multipath routing;network performance;sim lock;throughput	Junaid Qadir;Anwaar Ali;Kok-Lim Alvin Yau;Arjuna Sathiaseelan;Jon A Crowcroft	2015	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/COMST.2015.2453941	routing domain;routing;real-time computing;the internet;telecommunications;computer science;multipath routing;reliability;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;computer security;wireless;computer network	Networks	-11.582633664452949	84.89567276201115	185048
902533c5b152e1de01d5566d28b64b994b23d091	a survey on low latency towards 5g: ran, core network and caching solutions		The fifth generation (5G) wireless network technology is to be standardized by 2020, where main goals are to improve capacity, reliability, and energy efficiency, while reducing latency and massively increasing connection density. An integral part of 5G is the capability to transmit touch perception type real-time communication empowered by applicable robotics and haptics equipment at the network edge. In this regard, we need drastic changes in network architecture including core and radio access network (RAN) for achieving end-to-end latency on the order of 1 ms. In this paper, we present a detailed survey on the emerging technologies to achieve low latency communications considering three different solution domains: 1) RAN; 2) core network; and 3) caching. We also present a general overview of major 5G cellular network elements such as software defined network, network function virtualization, caching, and mobile edge computing capable of meeting latency and other 5G requirements.	cache (computing);edge computing;end-to-end principle;fifth generation computer;floor and ceiling functions;interrupt latency;network architecture;network function virtualization;radio access network;real-time locating system;requirement;robotics;software-defined networking;transfer function	Imtiaz Parvez;Ali Rahmati;Ismail GÃ¼venÃ§;Arif I.

The device uses the concepts of combination of optical add/drop multiplexing and optical cross connect between two main transmission lines in order to implement the wavelength routing operation. MEMS optical switches are integrated in the device to make it re-configurable. With excellent features, the device is particularly designed to improve network efficiency, flexibility and survivability. The device can be used in point to point, ring or mesh network topology to provide functionality such as routing, supervision, transport, multiplexing and restoration of client digital signals processed predominantly in the optical domain. The wavelengths on each optical trunk can be switched between each other while implementing add and drop functions simultaneously. We do a comparison between OXADM with the previous devices such as, OXC, TRN and OXN. The limitation occurs in OXADM as compare with OXC is also studied analytically in the respect of scalability (in term number of ports and operating wavelengths).	circuit restoration;digital cross connect system;mesh networking;microelectromechanical systems;multiplexer;network switch;network topology;optical cross-connect;optical switch;routing;scalability;transmission line;wavelength-division multiplexing	Mohammad Syuhaimi Ab-Rahman;Mohd Faisal Ibrahim	2008	2008 Second Asia International Conference on Modelling &#x00026; Simulation (AMS)	10.1109/AMS.2008.179	optical transport network;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;optical add-drop multiplexer;optical cross-connect;computer network	Visualization	-7.414614052036665	85.51933323373825	185155

We identified the properties of the ideal network structure that will maximize the advantage of multi-path and multi-home routing using mathematical analyses. We focused on how each end-to-end path is built, how many multi-paths exist and how each multi-path consists of multi-path and multi-homing segments. Second, we analyzed the trends in the recent changes in how the Internet is structured from the view point of inter-domain multi-path routing. The mathematical analyses suggest that a large number of multi-paths or multi-homing is not necessary to effectively benefit from multi-path routing. However, it will be important to keep the path length short in the segments where multiple paths are not available. The analyses on the recent changes in the Internet structure suggest that multi-path routing will contribute to improvement of reliability in two different ways. For the autonomous systems away from the Internet core, multi-path routing will improve the reliability by going around the busy Internet core, while it will improve the reliability by distributing network traffic load through the Internet core for the autonomous systems close to the core.	autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);border gateway protocol;canonical account;dns hijacking;end-to-end principle;future internet;inter-domain;internet backbone;megabyte;missile guidance;multihoming;multipath routing;multiple homing;network congestion;network packet;network traffic control;peering;routing table;tier 1 network;tree structure;wiki	Hiroshi Fujinoki;Andrew G.

The path diversification mechanism is targeted at the end-to-end layer, but can be applied at any level for which a path discovery service is available. Path diversification also takes into account service requirements for low-latency or maximal reliability in selecting appropriate paths. Using this mechanism will allow future internetworking architectures to exploit naturally rich physical topologies to a far greater extent than is possible with shortest-path routing or equal-cost load balancing. We describe the path diversity metric and its application at various aggregation levels, and apply the path diversification process to 13 real-world network graphs as well as 4 synthetic topologies to asses the gain in flow reliability. Based on the analysis of flow reliability across a range of networks, we then extend our path diversity metric to create a composJ. P.

2cc7f5f96eddce1cc18642e783f5cd3b1de4ddb5	experience-driven networking: a deep reinforcement learning based approach		Modern communication networks have become very complicated and highly dynamic, which makes them hard to model, predict and control. In this paper, we develop a novel experience-driven approach that can learn to well control a communication network from its own experience rather than an accurate mathematical model, just as a human learns a new skill (such as driving, swimming, etc). Specifically, we, for the first time, propose to leverage emerging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for enabling model-free control in communication networks; and present a novel and highly effective DRL-based control framework, DRL-TE, for a fundamental networking problem: Traffic Engineering (TE). The proposed framework maximizes a widely-used utility function by jointly learning network environment and its dynamics, and making decisions under the guidance of powerful Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We propose two new techniques, TE-aware exploration and actor-critic-based prioritized experience replay, to optimize the general DRL framework particularly for TE. To validate and evaluate the proposed framework, we implemented it in ns-3, and tested it comprehensively with both representative and randomly generated network topologies. Extensive packet-level simulation results show that 1) compared to several widely-used baseline methods, DRL-TE significantly reduces end-to-end delay and consistently improves the network utility, while offering better or comparable throughput; 2) DRL-TE is robust to network changes; and 3) DRL-TE consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art DRL method (for continuous control), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), which, however, does not offer satisfying performance.

It works by scheduling bandwidth probes between pairs of hosts, wherein each pairwise exchange reveals the upload constraint of one participant. Using the abstraction of bandwidth tournaments, unresolved hosts are successively paired with each other until every peer knows its upload bandwidth. To recover from measurement errors that corrupt its tournament schedule, ThunderDome aggregates multiple probe results for each host, avoiding pathological bandwidth estimations that would otherwise occur in systems with heterogeneous bandwidth distributions. For scalability, the coordination of probes is distributed across the hosts. Simulations on empirical and analytic bandwidth distributions--validated with wide-area PlanetLab experiments--show that ThunderDome efficiently yields upload bandwidth estimates that are robust to measurement error.	bandwidth (signal processing);computer simulation;experiment;hoc (programming language);peer-to-peer;planetlab;scalability;scheduling (computing);upload	John R.

The approach is based on a genetic algorithm (GA) and it includes a connection admission control (CAC), to provide a network with simultaneous fairness in distance and bandwidth capacity. The algorithm is evaluated by means of computer simulations using a mesh network with two types of node architectures capable of performing traffic grooming. Combining the two types of nodes, the performance of four network configurations is compared. Assuming that one of the two node types is more costly, two sparse node allocations are suggested to maintain the network cost-effective. The algorithm assigns wavelengths to the ligthpaths, routes the traffic streams, manages the grooming of sub-wavelength tributaries onto full wavelength channels, provides fairness, and minimizes the overall blocking probability of connection requests. Numerical results attest the usefulness of the proposed approach considering several scenarios of distance and bandwidth capacity classes of requests. Simultaneous and isolated simulations of the two fairness schemes are also compared, emphasizing the versatility of the algorithm.	blocking (computing);common access card;computer simulation;erlang (unit);fairness measure;genetic algorithm;mesh networking;network performance;routing and wavelength assignment;software release life cycle;sparse matrix;wavelength-division multiplexing	Marcos A.

cb3780edfa798761bd0ca32a61258c52b7967f9e	model-based analytics for profiling workloads in virtual network functions		With the flexibility and programmability levels offered by Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), it is expected to catalyze the upcoming âsoftwarizationâ of the network through software implementation of networking functionalities on virtual machines (VMs). While looking into the different issues thrown at NFV, numerous works have demonstrated how performance, power consumption and, consequently, the optimal resource configuration and VM allocation vary with the statistical features of the workload â specifically, the âburstinessâ of the traffic. This paper proposes a model-based analytics approach for profiling (virtual) network function (VNF) workloads that captures traffic burstiness, considering â and adding value to â hardware/software performance monitor counters (PMCs) available in Linux host servers. Results show good estimation accuracies for the chosen PMCs, which can be useful to enhance current methods for finegrained provisioning, usage-based pricing and anomaly detection, and facilitate the way towards an agile network.	agile software development;anomaly detection;central processing unit;dpdk / dpdk.org;forwarding plane;linux;network function virtualization;overhead (computing);perf (linux);provisioning;queueing theory;router (computing);software performance testing;testbed;transfer function;virtual machine	Roberto Bruschi;Franco Davoli;Paolo Lago;Jane Frances Pajo	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2017.8116498	virtualization;virtual network;profiling (computer programming);real-time computing;virtual machine;provisioning;computer science;server;analytics;software performance testing	HPC	-16.591131690131935	80.17642254797866	185862
5908cf8502a558745ac3f8e40a0691b0ae37b8f8	cloud network management model a novel approach to manage cloud traffic		Cloud is in the air. More and More companies and personals are connecting to cloud with so many variety of offering provided by the companies. The cloud services are based on Internet i.e. TCP/IP. The paper discusses limitations of one of the main existing network management protocol i.e. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) with respect to the current network conditions. The network traffic is growing at a high speed. When we talk about the networked environment of cloud, the monitoring tool should be capable of handling the traffic tribulations efficiently and represent a correct scenario of the network condition. The proposed Model âCloud Network Management Model (CNMM)â provides a comprehensive solution to manage the growing traffic in cloud and trying to improve communication of manager and agents as in SNMP (the traditional TCP/IP network management protocol). Firstly CNMM concentrates on reduction of packet exchange between manager and agent. Secondly it eliminates the counter problems exist in SNMP by having periodic updates from agent without querying by the manager. For better management we are including managers using virtualized technology. CNMM is a proposed model with efficient communication, secure packet delivery and reduced traffic. Though the proposed model supposed to manage the cloud traffic in a better and efficient way, the model is still a theoretical study, its implementation and results are yet to discover. The model however is the first step towards development of supported algorithms and protocol. Our further study will concentrate on development of supported algorithms.	algorithm;cloud computing;continuation;internet protocol suite;network packet;openflow;simple network management protocol	Mamta Madan;Mohit Mathur	2014	CoRR	10.5121/ijccsa.2014.4502	traffic generation model;panorama9;network traffic control;simulation;network management station;operating system;network management application;computer security;computer network	Networks	-15.760723007293878	82.02264743674228	185892

2d748a0e5637ec1b2a91af6ea790e7272a7437f6	exploring functional slicing in the design of distributed sdn controllers		The conventional approach to scaling Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controllers today is to partition switches based on network topology, with each partition being controlled by a single physical controller, running all SDN applications. However, topological partitioning is limited by the fact that (i) performance of latency-sensitive (e.g., monitoring) SDN applications associated with a given partition may be impacted by co-located compute-intensive (e.g., route computation) applications; (ii) simultaneously achieving low convergence time and response times might be challenging; and (iii) communication between instances of an application across partitions may increase latencies. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we explore functional slicing, a complementary approach to scaling, where multiple SDN applications belonging to the same topological partition may be placed in physically distinct servers. We present Hydra, a framework for distributed SDN controllers based on functional slicing. Hydra chooses partitions based on convergence time as the primary metric, but places application instances across partitions in a manner that keeps response times low while considering communication between applications of a partition, and instances of an application across partitions.

However, increases in bandwidth have been accompanied by increases in power consumption, and despite sustained system design efforts to address power demand, significant technological challenges remain that threaten to slow future bandwidth growth. In this paper we describe the power and associated heat management challenges in today's routers. We advocate a broad approach to addressing this problem that includes making power-awareness a primary objective in the design and configuration of networks, and in the design and implementation of network protocols. We support our arguments by providing a case study of power demands of two standard router platforms that enables us to create a generic model for router power consumption. We apply this model in a set of target network configurations and use mixed integer optimization techniques to investigate power consumption, performance and robustness in static network design and in dynamic routing. Our results indicate the potential for significant power savings in operational networks by including power-awareness.	communications protocol;computer cooling;functional requirement;image scaling;internet;mathematical optimization;network planning and design;networking hardware;next-generation network;router (computing);routing;systems design;thermal management (electronics);water cooling	Joseph Chabarek;Joel Sommers;Paul Barford;Cristian Estan;David Tsiang;Stephen J.

It has been recognized that the processing of per-flow state information poses scalability problems, especially at core routers. To remedy this situation, in this paper we introduce an approach for stateless QoS routing in IP networks that assumes no support for signaling or reservation from the network. Instead, our approach makes use of the currently unused two bits in the DiffServ (DS) byte of the IP packet header. Simple heuristics are used to identify a low-cost delay-constrained path. These heuristics essentially divide the end-to-end path into at most two âsuperedgesâ that are connected by a ârelay nodeâ. Routers that lie on the same superedge use either the cost metric or the delay metric (but not both) to forward the packet. Standard hop-by-hop forwarding is performed with respect to either metric. Two different approaches are presented for implementing the relay-based forwarding. In the first approach, a probing protocol is used to identify the relay node and the routing metrics of the superedges. Tunneling and packet encapsulation are then used to forward packets from the source node to the relay node and then from the relay node to the destination node. The second approach does not require probing, but instead relies on the time-to-live (TTL) field in the header of the IP packet. Simulations are presented to evaluate the cost performance of the various approaches. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The goal of tomography is to infer the status of network internal characteristics based on end-to-end observations. In particular, binary tomography identifies the set of failed links from end-to-end path meausrments. Upon detecting the failure of one or more of the monitored paths, a monitor sends its measurements to a central coordinator. The coordinator then runs the binary tomography algorithm, which takes as input the topology of the network and the status (i.e., up or down) of all monitored paths and finds the minimum set of links that explain the observations.	algorithm;end-to-end principle;persistence (computer science);sensor;tomography	Ãtalo S.

It has the structure of a reverse banyan network (RBN) and consists of controlled switching elements (CSEs) which is obtained by extending the passive iterative-cells introduced by Narasimha [1994]. The CSE-based RBN has a set of external control inputs (ECIs) in addition to the data input and output lines and can generate different output patterns according to the ECI values. It is shown through four properties that the CSE-based RBN can perform the distribution function of the conventional distributor. In addition, it is rigorously described in the properties how to determine the set of ECI values to achieve the desired distribution function, which includes the distribution in the normal mode, in the reversed mode, and in alternation of these two modes. The proposed CSE-based distributor can be applied to a variety of occasions by modifying the use of the counter, the numbers to write on the registers, and the table to store the ECI values. Some of useful examples are demonstrated through applications to shift-sequence permutation, N/spl times/R concentration, nonblocking point-to-point switching, and virtual FIFO queueing. >	multiprotocol label switching	Jeong Gyu Lee;Byeong Gi Lee	1995	IEEE/ACM Trans.

LinuxDirector extends the TCP/IP stack of Linux kernel to support three IP load balancing techniques, VS/NAT, VS/TUN and VS/DR. Four scheduling algorithms have been implemented to assign connections to different servers. Scalability is achieved by transparently adding or removing a node in the cluster. High availability is provided by detecting node or daemon failures and reconfiguring the system appropriately. This paper describes the design and implementation of LinuxDirector and presents several of its features including scalability, high availability and connection affinity.	algorithm;backup;capability maturity model;daemon (computing);fault tolerance;goto;high availability;internet protocol suite;linux virtual server;load balancing (computing);loadable kernel module;network load balancing;network address translation;norm (social);processor affinity;requirement;routing;scalability;scheduling (computing);sensor;server (computing);tunneling protocol;virtual private server	Zhang Wensong;Shiyao Jin;Quanyuan Wu	2000	Journal of Computer Science and Technology	10.1007/BF02948838	round-robin dns;network load balancing services;real-time computing;computer science;load balancing;operating system;database;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Networks	-17.36011070192012	81.14898180070846	187081

Specifically, we examine topologies where the underlying nodes are connected at the small scale in a regular pattern, such as a ring, torus or cube, such that every node can route efficiently to nodes in its immediate vicinity, and amended by the addition of random links to nodes throughout the datacenter, such that a greedy algorithm can route packets to far away locations efficiently. Coupled with geographical address assignment, the resulting network can provide content routing in addition to traditional routing, and thus efficiently implement key-value stores. The irregular but self-similar nature of the network facilitates constructing large networks easily using prewired, commodity racks. We show that Small-World Datacenters can achieve higher bandwidth and fault tolerance compared to both conventional hierarchical datacenters as well as the recently proposed CamCube topology. Coupled with hardware acceleration for packet switching, small-world datacenters can achieve an order of magnitude higher bandwidth than a conventional datacenter, depending on the network traffic.	application-oriented networking;attributeâvalue pair;data center;fault tolerance;greedy algorithm;hardware acceleration;network packet;network switch;network traffic control;packet switching;routing;self-similarity	Ji-Yong Shin;Bernard Wong;Emin GÃ¼n Sirer	2011		10.1145/2038916.2038918	embedded system;fault tolerance;greedy algorithm;real-time computing;hardware acceleration;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;small-world network;network topology;computer network	Networks	-10.2108142800238	79.55623143109266	187120

Even though LFA is simple and unobtrusive, it has a significant drawback: it does not guarantee protection for all possible failure cases. Consequently, many IPFRR proposals have appeared lately, promising full failure coverage at the price of added complexity and non-trivial modifications to IP hardware and software. Meanwhile, LFA remains the only commercially available, and therefore, the only deployable IPFRR solution. Deployment, however, crucially depends on the extent to which LFA can protect failures in operational networks. In this paper, therefore, we revisit LFA in order to give theoretical insights and practical hints to LFA failure coverage analysis. First, we identify the topological properties a network must possess to profit from good failure coverage. Then, we study how coverage varies as new links are added to a network, we show how to do this optimally and, through extensive simulations, we arrive to the conclusion that cleverly adding just a couple of new links can improve the quality of LFA protection drastically.	best, worst and average case;fast reroute;graph theory;multiprotocol label switching;np-hardness;network topology;numerical analysis;router (computing);simulation;software deployment	GÃ¡bor RÃ©tvÃ¡ri;JÃ¡nos Tapolcai;GÃ¡bor Enyedi;AndrÃ¡s CsÃ¡szÃ¡r	2011	2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935135	routing;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;approximation algorithm;network topology;profitability index;computer network	Networks	-8.152919829022238	81.6714657756479	187255

In this problem, the relationship between spectrum connection and bit rate of the incoming request has been taken into account. In this paper, two algorithms have been proposed. The first one is based on a set of shortest paths whose lengths are determined by the number of links in the network. The second one is a modified version of Dijkstraâs algorithm. Modification of this algorithm is based on introduction of weights of the network links depending on the utilization of the links and the introduction of a aggregated spectrum of the path that is being selected. Extensive research has shown that algorithms reject the lower traffic volume as compared to well-known algorithms proposed in literature.	blocking (computing);dijkstra's algorithm;erlang (unit);grid network;modulation;national science foundation network;network topology;routing;scott continuity;shortest path problem	Ireneusz Olszewski	2017	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-017-0700-5	suurballe's algorithm;contiguity;path length;computer network;computer science;modulation;distributed computing;frequency allocation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;algorithm;mathematical optimization;optical path;dijkstra's algorithm	Networks	-5.891543546099614	83.30572580022051	187263
ad3eb40d782746f0c1f4352e99a0bfdc467966ed	capacity-aware and delay-guaranteed resilient controller placement for software-defined wans		Currently, one of the main enablers for network evolution is software-defined networking (SDN), where the control plane is decoupled from the data plane. A controller, as a (logically) centralized entity in the control plane, is the Achillesâ heel of SDN resilience since its failure would affect the proper functioning of the entire network. The resilience of the control plane is strongly linked to the controller placement problem, which deals with the positioning and assignment of controllers to the forwarding devices (i.e., switches). A resilient controller placement problem needs to assign more than one controller to a switch while it satisfies certain quality of service requirements. In this paper, we propose a solution for such a problem that, unlike most of the former studies, takes both the switch-controller /inter-controller latency requirements and the capacity of the controllers into account to meet the traffic load of switches. The proposed algorithms, one of which has a polynomial-time complexity, adopt a clique-based approach in graph theory to find high-quality solutions heuristically. It is evaluated with real wide area network (WAN) topologies and the corresponding results are extensively analyzed. The resultant studies equip the service providers with helpful insights into the design of a resilient software-defined WAN.	algorithm;centralized computing;control plane;forwarding plane;graph theory;heuristic;maximal set;network switch;network topology;non-functional requirement;polynomial;resultant;software-defined networking;time complexity	Maryam Tanha;Dawood Sajjadi;Rukhsana Ruby;Jianping Pan	2018	IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management	10.1109/TNSM.2018.2829661	latency (engineering);service provider;control theory;distributed computing;quality of service;network topology;heuristic;computer science;forwarding plane;wide area network	Networks	-11.657064472570351	82.52118398972665	187356

We compare its operation with known ways of providing loop-back recovery and show that the known methods are not applicable to WDM-based recovery. The second algorithm performs WDM loop-back recovery for node failures. We illustrate the operation of both algorithms and prove their validity.

It is evident in our empirical experiences with real-world systems that, it is not uncommon to have hundreds of thousands of viewers trying to join a program in the first few minutes of a live broadcast. This phenomenon in live streaming systems, referred as the flash crowd, poses unique challenges in the system design. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to capture the inherent relationship between time and scale during a flash crowd. We derive an upper bound on the system scale, and then demonstrate that the timing factor plays a critical role for such a system to scale. In addition, our analysis also brings a more indepth understanding with respect to the use of Gossip protocols, i.e., the effects of partial knowledge.	experience;gossip protocol;internet;mathematical model;peer-to-peer;provisioning;server (computing);slashdot effect;software deployment;streaming media;systems design;upload;world-system	Fangming Liu;Bo Li;Lili Zhong;Baochun Li;Di Niu	2009				Metrics	-17.205200707427398	75.95153162088587	187849

Computing resources located in different sites and belonging to multiple providers can be used for a service. One requirement for the user to get access to cloud services is being connected with the remote computing resources. Similarly, interworking between computing resources located in different sites requires network resources connecting them. Therefore, cloud services can be thought as composed of computing and network resources. Quality of service (QoS) constraints can be posed on both of them. This is motivating a request for cloud architectures able to discover remote computing and QoS network resources. Design of such architecture is still an open issue. In this paper, we provide a proposal for it. We leverage on the existing Next Generation Network architecture, which was designed for IP services, and propose extensions to address the cloud provisioning requirements. The proposed extensions are about control and transport layer functions for automatic discovery of computing and QoS networking resources, respectively. Simulation results show the scalability of the discovery model in networks with increasing size and number of cloud providers.	cloud computing;computation;diameter (protocol);end-to-end encryption;itil;information management system (ims);inter-domain;interoperability;layer element;network architecture;next-generation network;provisioning;quality of service;requirement;scalability;simulation;software as a service;software deployment;testbed	Silvana Greco Polito;Tommaso Nicoletti;Vincenzo Maniscalco	2013	2013 17th International Conference on Intelligence in Next Generation Networks (ICIN)	10.1109/ICIN.2013.6670894	cloud computing security;mobile qos;cloud computing;computer science;cloud testing;distributed computing;utility computing;services computing;world wide web;provisioning;computer network	HPC	-17.37969730075161	82.76244334833471	187952

Enabling the development of application specific routing algorithms, the separation fosters the performance of internet applications. On the other hand, Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) provides network related information such as network paths and geographic locations of hosts to applications running on the internet. Thus, it is possible to maintain an increase in the performance of the end-to-end internet applications by integrating SDN technology and ALTO protocol. In this paper, we propose a Video-on-Demand (VoD) architecture utilizing the integration of SDN and ALTO. In the architecture, the clients running the VoD applications reside in an SDN domain while the servers remain out of the SDN domain. Simulation results show that the integration of SDN and ALTO increases the Quality of Experience (QoE) in a VoD system compared to QoE which is achieved in a traditional VoD architecture.	algorithm;content delivery network;coupling (computer programming);downtime;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;future internet;load balancing (computing);routing;simulation;software-defined networking;streaming media;systems architecture;throughput;von neumann architecture	Cihat Cetinkaya;Muge Fesci-Sayit	2016	2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)	10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901547	real-time computing;computer science;world wide web;computer network	HPC	-14.481113764876824	84.70786530566699	188241

Cross-layer architectures may provide a more flexible solution: breaks the traditional structure by allowing interactions between two or more non-adjacent layers. This paper review the crossâlayer approach to network architecture and compare the different cross-layering architectures, observing that most current approaches depend purely on local information and provide only poor and inaccurate information gathering at the global scale. This paper also explores the possible use of cross-layering architectures in autonomic communications and the potential importance of new cross-layer architectures with a hybrid local and global view for autonomic communications.	algorithm;autonomic computing;autonomic networking;crosstalk;dominating set;graph (discrete mathematics);interaction;internet;load balancing (computing);network architecture;next-generation network;performance	Mohammad Abdur Razzaque;Simon A.

4caa193931e27c7e3bd1e058938dccaea26d7da7	want to scale in centralized systems? think p2p	computer communication networks;information systems and communication service;computer applications;it in business;decentralized distributed systems;computer systems organization and communication networks;peer to peer;processor architectures;cloud computing	Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have been widely researched over the past decade, leading to highly scalable implementations for a wide range of distributed services and applications. A P2P system assigns symmetric roles to machines, which can act both as client and server. This alleviates the need for any central component to maintain a global knowledge of the system. Instead, each peer takes individual decisions based on a local knowledge of the rest of the system, providing scalability by design. While P2P systems have been successfully applied to a wide range of distributed applications (multicast, routing, storage, pub-sub, video streaming), with some highly visible successes (Skype, Bitcoin), they tend to have fallen out of fashion in favor of a much more cloud-centric vision of the current Internet. We think this is paradoxical, as cloud-based systems are themselves large-scale, highly distributed infrastructures. They reside within massive, densely interconnected datacenters, and must execute efficiently on an increasing number of machines, while dealing with growing volumes of data. Today even more than a decade ago, large-scale systems require scalable designs to deliver efficient services. In this paper we argue that the local nature of P2P systems is key for scalability regardless whether a system is eventually deployed on a single multi-core machine, distributed within a data center, or fully decentralized across multiple autonomous hosts. Our claim is backed by the observation that some of the most scalable services in use today have been heavily influenced by abstractions and rationales introduced in the context of P2P systems. Looking to the future, we argue that future large-scale systems could greatly benefit from fully decentralized strategies inspired from P2P systems. We illustrate the P2P legacy through several examples related to Cloud Computing and Big Data, and provide general guidelines to design large-scale systems according to a P2P philosophy.	autonomous robot;big data;bitcoin;centralized computing;cloud computing;data center;distributed computing;multi-core processor;multicast;peer-to-peer;routing;scalability;server (computing);streaming media	Anne-Marie Kermarrec;FranÃ§ois TaÃ¯ani	2015	Journal of Internet Services and Applications	10.1186/s13174-015-0029-1	real-time computing;cloud computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer applications;computer network	OS	-15.681348128337758	81.70210597351485	188659

Recently, Content-Centric Networking (CCN) has emerged as a clean-slate future network architecture, with totally different protocols than a hostbased TCP/IP network. However, current web servers are mainly designed for HTTP over a TCP/IP network and can not directly support CCN-based web applications. Therefore, how to effectively support the dominant browser-based web applications is a key to the success of CCN. Instead of providing a transitional HTTP/CCN transforming gateway or proxy, we design and develop the first practical CCN-enabled web server (called CCNxTomcat) based on open source Apache Tomcat and the CCNx library to natively support CCN-based web applications. The CCN functions are integrated into the web server for content distribution by seamlessly coordinating with the underlying CCN network. To support legacy applications and a smooth evolution from an IP network to CCN, CCNxTomcat also supports the HTTP protocol besides the CCN. Experimental results show that CCNxTomcat outperforms the existing HTTP/CCN proxy implementations by 58% in a single request, and by a factor of three in 1000 concurrent requests, in terms of throughput. Furthermore, we design and implement a novel cache (called ccncache) for the Servlet response, performing name lookups for Content Packets with a high efficiency. The results indicate that ccncache is 2.5 times faster than the existing CCNx Content Store, with only 30% additional memory consumption. In addition, a real CCN-based web application is deployed on a CCN experimental network, which validates the applicability of CCNxTomcat. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Packet subscriptions generalize forwarding rules, and can be used to express both traditional routing and more esoteric, content-based approaches. We describe a compiler for packet subscriptions that uses a novel BDD-based algorithm to efficiently translate predicates into P4 tables that can support O(100K) expressions. Using our compiler, we've built a proof-of-concept pub/sub financial application for splitting market feeds (e.g., Nasdaq's ITCH protocol) with line-rate message processing, using the full switch bandwidth of 6.5Tbps.	algorithm;application-specific integrated circuit;compiler;distributed computing;emergence;network packet;networking hardware;publishâsubscribe pattern;routing	Theo Jepsen;Masoud Moshref;Antonio Carzaniga;Nate Foster;Robert SoulÃ©	2018		10.1145/3286062.3286092	compiler;computer science;distributed computing;network packet;expression (mathematics);abstraction;bandwidth (signal processing)	Networks	-15.272713958432279	79.95818602319086	188808

The result is ICN-RE, the first ICN design that supports redundancy elimination. We show by means of numerical evaluations that ICN-RE improves bandwidth efficiency by 15-40% compared to vanilla ICN, and that the state of the art hardware can support ICN-RE at line speeds up to 100Gbps. Also, we discuss several benefits of adopting ICN-RE as a networkwide RE solution when compared to state of the art redundancy elimination designs.	bitstream;byte;cpu cache;cache (computing);data access;icn gps;numerical analysis;programming paradigm;spectral efficiency	Diego Perino;Matteo Varvello;Krishna P.

1c5655e4e37cd7321078829750a89d1ee518026f	energy-efficiency-aware upgrade of network capacity		Energy efficiency of a network, defined as the number of bits transmitted per unit of consumed energy, increases with the traffic load for a constant network capacity. This comes from the fact that energy is composed of two components: a fixed one, consumed by the network regardless of the traffic load, and a variable one, which depends on the traffic load. And so, when traffic load increases, the fixed component gets amortized. However, a network upgrade, namely adding more equipment in the network to fit traffic increase, comes typically with a higher increase in capacity than traffic, at least for a while after the upgrade, as traffic previsions are based on relatively long term projections. Thus, the power consumption of the network would increase faster than the traffic, and energy efficiency would then decrease. We investigate in this work the conditions under which a network upgrade does not deteriorate its energy efficiency. We consider two ways of upgrading a network: either by adding equipment with the same technology or by deploying equipment with another technology, typically more recent and more efficient. We discuss in both cases the number of equipment to be added so that to preserve the network's energy performance.	amortized analysis;approximation algorithm;compaq lte;linear function;network congestion;network topology;numerical analysis;point of view (computer hardware company);upload;while;windows 95	Wilfried Yoro;Mamdouh El Tabach;Taoufik En-Najjary;Azeddine Gati;Tijani Chahed	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925952	simulation	Metrics	-17.712911010423774	78.62216180750401	189184

Enabling multicast over WDM links requires the use of multicast-capable optical cross-connects (MC-OXCs) equipped with power splitters to replicate and interconnect an input signal on a particular wavelength to one or more output fibers, possibly on different wavelengths. All existing design approaches for FWÃFW strictly nonblocking MC-OXCs with F fibers, each carries W wavelengths require the use of power splitters with a fan-out degree of O(FW). For typical large values of F and W, complex and power-consuming active devices are needed to compensate for the lost power due to splitting. In this paper, we propose a new class of strictly nonblocking MC-OXC, namely, the Convert-and-Deliver (CAD) cross-connect to reduce power consumption. The new CAD OXC uses power splitters with a fan-out degree of only O(F) instead of O(FW). It is shown that, making the fan-out degree independent of W in the proposed design does not only reduce splitting power loss considerably, but it also enhances the scalability of the design. In particular, for any value of F, upgrading the number of wavelengths per fiber does not incur any changes to the fan-out degree or the power loss in the used splitters; a feature that cannot be obtained with any existing MC-OXC design approach.	computation;computer-aided design;degree (graph theory);digital cross connect system;fan-out;interconnection;multicast;optical cross-connect;requirement;scalability;self-replicating machine;t-flex cad;wavelength-division multiplexing	Haitham S.

f00e2b2462f515582d69c3dda113e905df065693	silkroad: making stateful layer-4 load balancing fast and cheap using switching asics		In this paper, we show that up to hundreds of software load balancer (SLB) servers can be replaced by a single modern switching ASIC, potentially reducing the cost of load balancing by over two orders of magnitude. Today, large data centers typically employ hundreds or thousands of servers to load-balance incoming traffic over application servers. These software load balancers (SLBs) map packets destined to a service (with a virtual IP address, or VIP), to a pool of servers tasked with providing the service (with multiple direct IP addresses, or DIPs). An SLB is stateful, it must always map a connection to the same server, even if the pool of servers changes and/or if the load is spread differently across the pool. This property is called per-connection consistency or PCC. The challenge is that the load balancer must keep track of millions of connections simultaneously.  Until recently, it was not possible to implement a load balancer with PCC in a merchant switching ASIC, because high-performance switching ASICs typically can not maintain per-connection states with PCC. Newer switching ASICs provide resources and primitives to enable PCC at a large scale. In this paper, we explore how to use switching ASICs to build much faster load balancers than have been built before. Our system, called SilkRoad, is defined in a 400 line P4 program and when compiled to a state-of-the-art switching ASIC, we show it can load-balance ten million connections simultaneously at line rate.	application server;application-specific integrated circuit;data center;load balancing (computing);portable c compiler;server (computing);state (computer science);stateful firewall;virtual ip address	Rui Miao;Hongyi Zeng;Changhoon Kim;Jeongkeun Lee;Minlan Yu	2017		10.1145/3098822.3098824	computer science;computer network;application-specific integrated circuit;stateful firewall;virtual ip address;real-time computing;network packet;network load balancing services;server;load balancing (computing);round-robin dns	Networks	-14.892205667124815	81.25391402861771	189478
816c5aa6a936e404ff087231ac934dc6645867c6	a secure and stable multicast overlay network with load balancing for scalable iptv services		The emerging multimedia Internet application IPTV over P2P network preserves significant advantages in scalability. IPTV media content delivered in P2P networks over public Internet still preserves the issues of privacy and intellectual property rights. In this paper, we use SIP protocol to construct a secure application-layer multicast overlay network for IPTV, called SIPTVMON. SIPTVMON can secure all the IPTV media delivery paths against eavesdroppers via elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange on SIP signaling and AES encryption. Its load-balancing overlay tree is also optimized from peer heterogeneity and churn of peer joining and leaving to minimize both service degradation and latency. The performance results from large-scale simulations and experiments on different optimization criteria demonstrate SIPTVMON's cost effectiveness in quality of privacy protection, stability from user churn, and good perceptual quality of objective PSNR values for scalable IPTV services over Internet.	iptv;load balancing (computing);multicast;overlay network	Tsao-Ta Wei;Chia-Hui Wang;Yu-Hsien Chu;Ray-I Chang	2012	Int.

This issue arises when the set of LSPs is recalculated by a central path optimization tool to attain a better resource utilization in the network. In this case a sequence of LSPs has to be found for their one by one reconfiguration without service interruption, involving the constraint that the link capacities should not be violated at any time during the rerouting process. The underlying problem is related to discrepancy theory and it is NP-complete. The conditions of existence of any feasible reroute sequence are examined, and algorithms are described for solving the problem.

a98934181e5d8a7a94f684ff882a08f1f20dccb3	network-in-a-box: a survey about on-demand flexible networks		One of the key features of next-generation mobile networks is the ability to satisfy the requirements coming from different verticals. For satisfying these requirements, 5G networks will need to dynamically reconfigure the deployment of the network functions. However, the current deployments of mobile networks are experiencing difficulties in exhibiting the required flexibility. At the same time, the research on connectivity provisioning in use cases such as after-disaster scenarios or battlefields has converged toward the idea of Network-In-a-Box. This idea revolves around fitting all software and hardware modules needed by a mobile network in a single or a handful of physical devices. A Network-In-a-Box inherently offers a high level of flexibility that makes it capable of providing connectivity services in a wide range of scenarios. Therefore, the Network-In-a-Box concept represents an alternative approach for satisfying the requirements of next-generation mobile networks. In this survey, we analyze the state-of-the-art of Network-In-a-Box solutions proposed by academia and industry in the time frame starting from 1998 up to early 2017. First, we present the main use cases around which the concept has been conceived. Then, we abstract the common features of the Network-In-a-Box implementations, and discuss how different proposals offer these features. We then draw our conclusions and discuss possible future research directions, including steps required to reach an even higher level of flexibility. The aim of our analysis is twofold. On one hand, we provide a comprehensive view of the idea of Network-In-a-Box. On the other hand, through the analysis, we present the features that future mobile networks should exhibit to achieve their design goals. In particular, we show how the Network-In-a-Box fosters the transition toward the next-generation mobile networks.	backward compatibility;etsi satellite digital radio;high-level programming language;interface builder;malware;next-generation network;openness;provisioning;requirement;software deployment;third-party software component	Matteo Pozza;Ashwin Rao;Hannu Flinck;Sasu Tarkoma	2018	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/COMST.2018.2807125	software deployment;implementation;computer science;distributed computing;provisioning;use case;next-generation network;software;cellular network;wireless ad hoc network	Mobile	-15.54216996962989	85.78368986889389	189981

Although software-defined networking (SDN) enables flexible network control, its applicability to mobile networks is still in its infancy. When it comes to introducing the SDN vision to mobile networks, handling of wireless events and mobility management operations stand out as major challenges. In this paper, we study the scalability issues of SDNized wireless networks, specifically those relevant to mobility management. We design and implement different mobility management approaches in SDNized wireless networks and investigate the impact of various system variables on the overall handover delays. We also study the improvements in handover delays: (i) when a proposed proactive mobility management algorithm is implemented; (ii) when the controller delegates partial control of mobility management to the forwarding entities. For the implementation of the proposed approaches on the OpenFlow network, the paper also suggests potential extensions to the OpenFlow protocol. The contributed approaches are validated on a full-scale demonstrator, with results showing that proactive outperforms reactive and that the delegated control approach performs better than proactive for smaller topology sizes. Furthermore, a proposal for LTE X2-specific control delegation is discussed as a use case.	software-defined networking	Manzoor Ahmed Khan;Xuan T.

As individual spacecraft are limited by the size, mass, and power constraints, mass-produced small satellites in large constellations or clusters could be useful in many science missions such as gravity mapping, tracking of forest fires, finding water resources, etc. The proliferation of small satellites will enable a better understanding of the near-Earth environment and provide an efficient and economical means to access the space through the use of multi-satellite solution. Constellation of satellites provide improved spatial and temporal resolution of the target. Small satellite constellations contribute innovative applications by replacing a single asset with several very capable spacecraft, which opens the door to new applications. Future space missions are envisioned to become more complex and operate farther from Earth, and will need to support autonomous operations with minimal human intervention. With increasing levels of autonomy, there will be a need for remote communication networks to enable communication between spacecraft. These space-based networks will need to configure and maintain dynamic routes, manage intermediate nodes, and reconfigure themselves to achieve mission objectives. Hence, inter-satellite communication is a key aspect when satellites fly in formation. In this survey, we present the various research being conducted in the small satellite community for implementing inter-satellite communications based on the open system interconnection (OSI) model. This survey also reviews the various design parameters applicable to the first three layers of the OSI model, i.e., physical, data link, and network layer. Based on the survey, we also present a comprehensive list of design parameters useful for achieving inter-satellite communications for multiple small satellite missions. Specific topics include proposed solutions for some of the challenges faced by small satellite systems, enabling operations using a network of small satellites, and some examples of small satellite missions involving formation flying aspects.	autonomous robot;autonomy;communications satellite;inter-process communication;interconnection;osi model;telecommunications network	Radhika Radhakrishnan;William W.

Particular challenges include the resource and bandwidth constraints on sensor nodes, the spatiotemporally dynamic network behaviors, and the lack of accurate models to understand such behaviors in a hostile environment. In this paper, we present the Sensor Anomaly Visualization Engine (SAVE), a system that fully leverages the power of both visualization and anomaly detection analytics to guide the user to quickly and accurately diagnose sensor network failures and faults. SAVE combines customized visualizations over separate sensor data facets as multiple coordinated views. Temporal expansion model, correlation graph and dynamic projection views are proposed to effectively interpret the topological, correlational and dimensional sensor data dynamics and their anomalies. Through a case study with real-world sensor network system and administrators, we demonstrate that SAVE is able to help better locate the system problem and further identify the root cause of major sensor network failure scenarios.	anomaly detection;internet access;sensor;usability;visual analytics	Lei Shi;Qi Liao;Yuan He;Rui Li;Aaron Striegel;Zhong Su	2011	2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)	10.1109/VAST.2011.6102458	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;data mining;data visualization;statistics;visual sensor network	Mobile	-14.492840576373936	79.04645921327094	191002
c5bf1145b594c518ba7fa891a597f3b5ae9da95f	demo abstract: stemflow: inter-datacenter overlay as a service		Thanks to the abundant available bandwidth and multiple paths on wide-area links that interconnect datacenters on major cloud platforms, it is conceivable that bandwidth-intensive applications may improve their performance by relaying their traffic through such an inter-datacenter network. We propose Stemflow, a new systems framework that provides Inter-Datacenter Overlay as a Service. It is provided as a turn-key solution for applications to conveniently and transparently tap into the available bandwidth resources across datacenters in the cloud, with internal optimizations on the performance of data delivery. Internally, we have implemented Stemflow as a software-defined overlay. We present two interactive cloud applications built upon Stemflow â live video broadcast and instant messaging â to demonstrate the ease of development and the performance gains by using Stemflow.	cloud computing;data center;instant messaging;turnkey	Shuhao Liu;Baochun Li	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2017.8116518	interconnection;throughput;cloud computing;stemflow;overlay;computer network;bandwidth (signal processing);broadcasting;computer science;server	Visualization	-15.205629605241413	81.15938397876008	191016

In WDM stars the fundamental problem of receiver conflicts leads to severe performance degradation. In current solutions conflicts are prevented by scheduling transmissions or resolved by retransmissions. Both approaches waste bandwidth and involve electronic processing and buffering. The proposed approach is conceptually different in introducing a local conflict resolution mechanism at each receiver incorporating delay limes. This solution brings optical star networks a step closer to an all-optical realization. In addition, it allows an almost total utilization of the channels, as obtainable until now only by TDM control. Contrary to TDM, however, the proposed solution does not suffer performance degradation under heterogeneous traffic conditions and increasing number of nodes. It is thus unique in offering the potential of an all-optical solution providing at the same time high throughput, low delay, small buffer requirements, and robustness under all traffic conditions.	data buffer;elegant degradation;nvidia quadro;requirement;scheduling (computing);star network;throughput;wavelength-division multiplexing	Imrich Chlamtac;Andrea Fumagalli	1994	IEEE Trans.

Due to the interdependence, node failures in one network may lead to failures of the other network and result in cascading failures of the whole system. One of the reasons for this phenomena is attributed to the connectivity of the interdependent system, which hinges heavily on the operation probability (or equivalently reliability) of networks in the light of node reliability. In this paper, we present the model of k-reliability, define cascading failures based on k-reliability, and propose an algorithm to calculate k-reliability for estimation of potential cascading failures. The proposed k-reliability, defined as the probability that at least k surviving nodes span an operating subnetwork, explains the operation probability of the system and reflects the connectivity of nodes in networks. In particular, we find that the network with regular interlink allocation strategy is homogeneous to the network with maximum k-reliability in class of graphs with 2n nodes and 2d edges when the information of intratopology is unknown. That is, regardless of the information of each individual network, the strategy that all nodes in the system are allotted the same number of bidirectional interlinks yields better performance on k- reliability than all other possible strategies both analytically and experimentally.	algorithm;cascading failure;cyber-physical system;experiment;interaction;interdependence;subnetwork	Zuyuan Zhang;Wei An;Fang-Ming Shao	2016	IEEE Transactions on Reliability	10.1109/TR.2016.2606125	reliability engineering;real-time computing;systems modeling;engineering;interdependent networks;power-system protection;cyber-physical system;computer security	Metrics	-7.340622006871302	77.63323884974963	191305
d61fc69a1dcbc686dc1f4f625e6982f822cbb257	ndnc-ban: supporting rich media healthcare services via named data networking in cloud-assisted wireless body area networks	healthcare;wireless body area networks;named data networking;cloud computing	Nowadays, Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is broadly utilized for health monitoring and remote medical care. When the physiological information collected in WBAN is distributed to cloud computing platform, a new healthcare service mode is enabled by âcloud-assisted WBANâ, where userâs body signals can be stored, processed, managed and analyzed over a long-term period. Though the provisioning of healthcare services is largely enhanced via cloud-enabled technologies, more challenging issues are raised due to the increased userâs requirements on quality of experience (QoE) in terms of user mobility, content delivery latency, and personalized interaction, etc. In order to tackle these challenges, this paper presents various solutions including: (1) a novel integration of WBAN with Long Term Evolution (LTE) to support high user mobility; (2) an efficient scheme to distribute contents by leveraging the emerging named data networking (NDN) technology, to support rich media healthcare content delivery without service interruption while achieving low cost and bandwidth saving; (3) the use of adaptive streaming to adjust suitable content size according to the dynamic bandwidth. The experimental results conducted by OPNET verify the viability of NDN and adaptive streaming to support the healthcare services involving the transmissions of rich media contents between WBAN and internet.	interactive media	Min Chen	2014	Inf.

a661b17278045f5064b0b9953ed5dcb97dfe2ba6	rule optimization for real-time query service in software-defined internet of vehicles		Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has recently gained considerable attentions from both industry and research communities since the development of communication technology and smart city. However, a proprietary and closed way of operating hardwares in network equipments slows down the progress of new services deployment and extension in IoV. Moreover, the tightly coupled control and data planes in traditional networks significantly increase the complexity and cost of network management. By proposing a novel architecture, called SoftwareDefined Internet of Vehicles (SDIV), we adopt the softwaredefined network (SDN) architecture to address these problems by leveraging its separation of the control plane from the data plane and a uniform way to configure heterogeneous switches. However, the characteristics of IoV introduce the very challenges in rule installation due to the limited size of Flow Tables at OpenFlowenabled switches which are the main component of SDN. It is necessary to build compact Flow Tables for the scalability of IoV. Accordingly, we develop a rule optimization approach for real-time query service in SDIV. Specifically, we separate wired data plane from wireless data plane and use multicast address in wireless data plane. Furthermore, we introduce a destinationdriven model in wired data plane for reducing the number of rules at switches. Experiments show that our rule optimization strategy reduces the number of rules while keeping the performance of data transmission.	control plane;forwarding plane;internet;mathematical optimization;multicast address;network switch;real-time clock;real-time transcription;scalability;smart city;software deployment;software-defined networking	Xin Wang;Cheng Wang;Changjun Jiang;Lei Yang;Zhongqiao Li;Xiaobo Zhou	2015	CoRR		simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Networks	-13.616231432138894	83.15339765685941	191542
