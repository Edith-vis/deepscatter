77952a360b8b582edf5e265e168810ba74609222	a novel scatternet scheme with ipv6 compatibility	ip multicast;piconet;scatternet;ip;routing algorithm;bluetooth;multicast	Some market analysts predict that there will be some 1.4 billion Bluetooth devices in operation by the year 2005 [8]. However, the current specification1.1 does not describe the algorithms or mechanisms to create a scatternet due to a variety of unsolved issues [3,12]. Since the upper layers are not defined in Bluetooth, it is not possible to implement the scatternet in current specification. Hence in this research, we need make some modifications to Bluetooth protocol in order to support the transmissions of packets in the scatternet. In this paper we describe a novel scatternet architecture, and present link performance of the proposed architecture. The issues of the routing algorithm, handoffs, and communications with other networks are also discussed.	algorithm;bluetooth;computer simulation;ibm websphere business events;national supercomputer centre in sweden;network packet;network switch;routing	Wei Kuang Lai;Der Hwa Tan	2003	MONET	10.1023/A:1026082628602	internet protocol;scatternet;real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;computer science;piconet;distributed computing;bluetooth;computer network	Mobile	-18.721038971170525	89.75866028175379	136512

Others present scenarios where buffer sizes need to be significantly increased. So why the different rules? In this paper we briefly compare the different results and proposals, and summarize some recent preliminary experiments to validate the proposals. We'll see that different results apply to different parts of the network, and depend on several assumptions. For example, we believe that buffers can be safely reduced by an order of magnitude in the routers in service provider backbone networks; but it would be premature to reduce them in routers closer to the edge.	core router;experiment;internet backbone;router (computing)	Yashar Ganjali;Nick McKeown	2006	Computer Communication Review	10.1145/1163593.1163605	service provider;core router;real-time computing;computer science;transmission control protocol;distributed computing;network congestion;computer network	Metrics	-6.111720409642811	92.64986756772957	136657

Workload characterization is crucial in IP traffic engineering to deploy an efficient network. However, traffic characteristics in commercial multiservice IP networks aren't well known because relevant datasets are rarely available. This article presents statistical analysis and modeling results of multimedia workload characteristics in a nationwide commercial IP network in Korea. The authors survey broadband Internet service market trends and the growth of network multimedia services. To investigate workload characteristics, they analyze service log information and session-level traffic models.	internet protocol suite	Yongmin Choi;John A.

In this paper, we present a gatewaybased architecture of the wireless home media network and develop a secure registration protocol that is appropriate for such an architecture. The primary goal of the protocol is to provide a secure bootstrap registration mechanism for a new media appliance and to ensure a secure communication path between appliances and the gateway that minimizes the resource usage at the appliance.	new media;secure communication;wireless router	Nut Taesombut;Vineet Kumar;Rishi Dubey;P.

In such a situation, it is necessary to understand the users’ perception, what should obviously be done using standardized subjective experiences. However, it is also important to develop artificial quality assessors that enable to automatically quantify the perceived quality. This efficiently helps performing optimal network and service management at the core and edges of the delivery systems. In our article, we explore the behavior rating of new emerging artificial speech quality assessors of VoIP calls subject to moderately bursty packet loss processes. The examined Speech Quality Assessment (SQA) algorithms are able to estimate speech quality of live VoIP calls at runtime using control information extracted from header content of received packets. They are especially designed to be sensitive to packet loss burstiness. The performance evaluation study is performed using a dedicated set-up software-based SQA framework. It offers a specialized packet killer and includes the implementation of four SQA algorithms. A speech quality database, which covers a wide range of bursty packet loss conditions, has been created and then thoroughly analyzed. Our main findings are the following: (1) all examined automatic bursty-loss aware speech quality assessors achieve a satisfactory correlation under upper (> 20%) and lower (< 10%) ranges of packet loss processes; (2) they exhibit a clear weakness to assess speech quality under a moderated packet loss process; (3) the accuracy of sequence-by-sequence basis of examined SQA algorithms should be addressed in detail for further precision.	algorithm;itil;internet;network packet;performance evaluation;run time (program lifecycle phase);software quality assurance	Sofiene Jelassi;Gerardo Rubino	2011	EURASIP J.

Any quality of service provided by the network thus has to be effectively translated by the transport layer protocol in order to be enjoyed by the applications. In this article, we argue for a fundamental rethinking of the transport layer design to facilitate such QoS delivery. We identify the key requirement for a QoS enabling transport layer protocol as the ability to effectively handle multiplicity in terms of user differentiation levels, network resources, and service models. However, TCP, the transport layer protocol predominantly used in the Internet, is unable to support such multiplicity due to its single-state design. We extend TCP to a parallel transport layer protocol called parallel TCP (pTCP) that can tackle the different dimensions of multiplicity, and hence enable varying classes of QoS to applications. We discuss the applicability of pTCP in three specific domains with different levels of network support for QoS, and present simulation results substantiating our arguments.	communications protocol;internet;programming paradigm;protocol stack;quality of service;simulation;transport layer security	Hung-Yun Hsieh;Raghupathy Sivakumar	2005	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2005.1421914	internet protocol;address resolution protocol;link layer;network architecture;quality of service;internet layer;resource reservation protocol;computer science;jumbogram;application layer;distributed computing;service layer;session initiation protocol;internet protocol suite;multihoming;ip tunnel;world wide web;transport layer;network layer;osi model;computer network	Networks	-13.128531745340908	93.0572175178738	137046

The contributions of the paper are threefold. First, to improve the quality fairness of multiple video streams, a modified Lloyd-Max quantization-based Priority Index (PID) assignment method for scalable video coding (SVC) is developed, where the base-layer quality is also embedded in the Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI) message of the SVC bit stream, in addition to the quantized rate-distortion slope of each MGS packet. Secondly, to build a fair """"contribute-and-reward"""" mechanism for P2P video streaming, we propose a multihierarchical topology that is based on peers' uploading bandwidth. Finally, we combine these two parts to build a SVC-based P2P network, which fully utilizes the quality scalability of SVC, and the end-user quality is determined by its uploading bandwidth contribution. The performance of the scheme is demonstrated by simulation results."""	network topology;streaming media	Xiaozheng Huang;Jie Liang;Yan Ding;Jiangchuan Liu	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21596-4_28	scalable video coding;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Crypto	-5.760458410572334	101.26443779393111	137161

In live streaming, scalable video streaming is also proposed to allow partial decoding of the video streaming at a reduced resolution, frame-rate or quality, adapting to different display requirements and receptions conditions of heterogeneous receivers. In live streaming applications, Network Coding (NC) has the potential to bring substantially higher throughput while reducing transmission delays. However, the bandwidth efficiency of NC transmission is still a problem to live media streaming due to the lack of synchronization among peers. To solve this problem, we introduce a scalable streaming system, which includes a layer selection algorithm and a distributed packet scheduling algorithm. The proposed system is tested by streaming a scalable video over a peer-to-peer network. The experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm achieves better video quality, better delivery ratio, and lower transmission redundancy.	linear network coding;network packet;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;requirement;scalability;scheduling (computing);selection algorithm;spectral efficiency;streaming media;throughput;triple modular redundancy;upload;video	Shenglan Huang;Ebroul Izquierdo;Pengwei Hao	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7510688	real time streaming protocol;linear network coding;real-time computing;media;computer science;distributed computing;scheduling;bandwidth;statistics;computer network	HPC	-7.402407693058717	101.45139482273636	137429

Video quality as a part of multimedia technology has a crucial role nowadays due to this increase. Since architecture of IP network has not been designed for real-time services like audio or video, there are many factors that can influence the final quality of service, especially packet loss and delay variation (also known as Jitter). The research was focused on the quality of video data delivery in many scenarios included different packet loss rate and simulating of different delay variation values in the network. Performed tests were evaluated by using of video objective methods. Based on results of these measurements, an extended QoS model for estimation of triple play services was designed. The proposed model allows us to compute the estimated objective quality parameters that describe the final quality of video service as a part of triple play services.	network packet;real-time clock;streaming media	Jaroslav Frnda;Miroslav Voznak;Lukas Sevcik	2016	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-015-0037-2	media delivery index;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;video quality;structural similarity;end-to-end delay;predictive modelling;packet loss;computer network	Embedded	-8.564943096765722	100.17257055490963	137686

Comparing with traditional Ethernet, the real-time characteristic of the switched Ethernet is more advanced because it provides a private collision domain to each port of a switch to avoid collisions. Based on the two embedded ARM controllers connected over the switched Ethernet, the real-time performance of four different protocols on ARM-Linux 2.4 and 2.6 platforms are assessed and discussed in this paper. The testing results show that the controllers connected over the switched Ethernet, with which using ARM-Linux and UDP or RTP protocol, to some extent has potential to be used in many real-time control applications, though some drawbacks still need to be improved. The other interesting point seen from the results is that there is a visible difference in real-time performance between ARM-Linux 2.4 and 2.6. This difference is ARM-Linux 2.6 has higher real-time performance than ARM-Linux 2.4. So ARM-Linux 2.6 in many networked control applications may be a better choice in many cases.	arm architecture;collision domain;control system;embedded system;linux;network switch;profiling (computer programming);real-time clock	J.

This paper presents a measurement methodology for evaluating quality of Internet service given by an ISP (Internet Service Provider), including a framework for defining the context and parameters for such measurement. The originality of this methodology lies principally in its reliance on sampling techniques and on its use of distributed applications to carry out measurement. The nature of the Internet places particular constraints on the amount and nature of data that can be collected, making statistical sampling necessary to answer certain types of questions. This paper addresses a number of methodological issues that arise when applying sampling techniques to the problem of measuring Internet service quality. This methodology is currently being implemented and tested by a major Canadian ISP.

The Internet Service Providers (ISP) have a hard time competing on value-added services with content providers and content delivery networks (CDN). We propose a new model of collaboration between content delivery actors where CDNs can deploy their software in Internet Service Providers' infrastructures as NFV modules. As the ISP network state has to be kept private, a high-level SLA is used to negotiate both computing resources and connectivity, leaving it up to the ISP to optimize server placement and routes.

TIP is a new approach to providing no-charge-to-user (""""toll-free"""") access over IP-based access networks (e.g., IEEE 802.11 and 802.16 wireless local area networks). Usage of IP access networks to communicate with a toll-free IP destination (identified by, for example, a toll-free IP address, Internet Domain Name, or Universal Resource Locator) is paid by the toll-free destination's owner. TIP allows one to use an IP access network without a service subscription, and without the need to authenticate with the access network or service provider (hence, no need for terminal software or hardware for authentication with access networks). It allows one to provide services over IP-based access networks without any business arrangement with the network operators or aggregators. TIP can be easily incorporated into, and hence coexist with, existing network access control frameworks."""	access network;authentication;coexist (image);internet;network access control;news aggregator;online locator service;terminal emulator	Tao Zhang;Sunil Madhani;Miriam Tauil	2005	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2005	10.1109/WCNC.2005.1424878	gprs core network;loose source routing;media access control;bogon filtering;next-generation network;ip address management;computer science;ip address spoofing;optical ip switching;ip forwarding;network address translation;authorization;internet privacy;ip tunnel;ip multimedia subsystem;computer security;nat traversal;computer network	Mobile	-18.028229742094503	89.98013848896585	138114

In fact, quality emerges as an end-to-end factor, for it is particularly sensitive to the end-user perception of the overall service, i.e., the user’s quality of experience (QoE). However, the two are not independent from each other and their relationship has to be studied through metrics that go beyond the typical network parameters. To better explore the value of assessing QoE alongside QoS in high-speed, lossy networks, this paper presents an experimental methodology to understand the relation between network QoS onto service QoE, with the aim to perform a combined network-service assessment. Using video streaming services as the test-case (given their extended usage nowadays), in this paper, we provide studies on three network-impaired video-sets with the aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of networks on video quality. First, the ReTRIeVED video set provides the means to understand the most impairing effects on networks. Furthermore, it triggered the idea to create our own sets, specialized in the most impairing conditions for 2-D and 3-D: the LIMP Video Quality Database and the 3-D-HEVC-Net Video Quality Database. Our study and methodology are meant to provide service providers with the means to pinpoint the working boundaries of their video-sets in face of different network conditions. At the same time, network operators may use our findings to predict how network control policies affect the user’s perception of the service.	emergence;end-to-end principle;high efficiency video coding;lossy compression;quality of service;stereoscopic video game;stereoscopy;streaming media	Maria Torres Vega;Cristian Perra;Antonio Liotta	2018	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2017.2781125	telecommunications;lossy compression;quality of service;service provider;operator (computer programming);psychological resilience;performance management;quality of experience;computer science;computer network;video quality	Metrics	-9.605894375209322	100.23654294034125	138425

The targeted applications are in the fields of industry automation and transport systems, healthcare, education and gaming. 5G addresses tactile use cases under the term mission-critical machine type communication. We demonstrate a first implementation of a wireless broadband communication system utilizing 20MHz bandwidth which can achieve a round-trip delay below 1 ms. Delay measurements were performed between two endpoints over the air. The system is based on a flexible Software Defined Radio (SDR) toolkit with PHY and MAC signal processing algorithms implemented on a multi-core DSP platform. The demonstration shows a live end-to-end transmission of real data packets while at the same time evaluating latency probes. In addition, we show the general feasibility of real-time implementation of ultra-low delay signal processing on SDRs. Finally, we give results by evaluation of latency and reliability performance indicators.	algorithm;digital signal processor;etsi satellite digital radio;end-to-end principle;internet;mission critical;multi-core processor;network packet;over the air;phy (chip);real-time clock;signal processing	Jens Pilz;Matthias Mehlhose;Thomas Wirth;Dennis Wieruch;Bernd Holfeld;Thomas Haustein	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2016.7562198	embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wired communication;computer network	Mobile	-11.807570094769575	94.7951204425856	138671

The IPv6 FL (flow label) is a function that, as it was designed, can be a big help in alleviating QoS problem in the next generation Internet. However, the related research work is still far from enough to make it practical. In this paper, we firstly investigate FL as a network layer QoS mechanism to provide a uniform platform cross multiple domains in heterogeneous network. The main contribution of this paper is threefold: First, we attempt to provide an analysis of FL-related definitions, and subsequently propose a modified IPv6 FL specification. Second, we propose FL-AG (Aggregated) QoS model for end-to-end QoS provision in heterogeneous networks. FL-AG model has excellent scalability and flexibility and is suitable for large-scale networks. Finally, detailed mechanism for FL generation, deletion and maintenance for FL-AG is proposed. Only in this way can FL be implemented in reality. Experiment results show that our FL-AG QoS model has better performance than existing ones.	end-to-end principle;internet;next-generation network;quality of service;scalability	Qiong Sun;Xiaohong Huang;Yan Ma	2009	2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering	10.1109/CSIE.2009.1083	mobile qos;heterogeneous network;computer science;distributed computing;world wide web;computer network	AI	-7.8623485167884155	94.02256586958161	138984

A cellular/VoWLAN dual mode system helps mobile users to access a low cost voice over IP (VoIP) service in a WLAN area and switch to a wide-coverage cellular system without WLANs. However, the system suffers the power consumption problem and the service continuity issue between cellular and WLAN systems. This study presents a network architecture for an enterprise or a dual mode service provider to permit service continuity between cellular and VoWLAN systems. This architecture is used as a basis for further elaborating a novel power saving mechanism, called PIANO (paging via another radio). By applying the proposed mechanisms to a dual mode mobile, the mobile can completely switch off its WLAN interface, only leaving the cellular interface awake to listen to paging signals. When a dual mode mobile receives a paging message from its cellular interface, it wakes up its WLAN interface and responds to the call via WLAN networks. Therefore, a dual mode mobile can reduce the idle mode power consumption, and can also obtain VoWLAN services. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed methods significantly extend the standby hours of a dual mode mobile	network architecture;network switch;paging;scott continuity;simulation;virtual 8086 mode	Shiao-Li Tsao;E-Cheng Cheng	2005	GLOBECOM '05.

In the proposed PMIPv6 handover scheme, when a mobile node (MN) moves into a new network and thus its Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) performs the binding update to the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA), the LMA begins the ‘partial’ bicasting of data packets to the new MAG as well as the previous MAG. Then, the data packets will be buffered at the new MAG during handover and then forwarded to MN after the handover operations are completed. The proposed scheme is compared with the existing schemes of PMIPv6 and PMIPv6 with bicasting by ns-2 simulations. From the performance analysis, we can see that the proposed scheme can reduce handover delays and packet losses, and can also use the network resource of wireless links more effectively, compared to the existing schemes.	mag (cryptography);mag technology co.;network packet;profiling (computer programming);proxy mobile ipv6;seamless3d;simulation	Ji In Kim;Seok Joo Koh	2011	The International Conference on Information Networking 2011 (ICOIN2011)	10.1109/ICOIN.2011.5723127	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	-10.92417397942102	89.72713503475602	139198

It collects distributed QoS information which is autonomously measured at each network segment in the backbone networks, and estimates the end-to-end QoS parameters from the collected data. It does not require sending the probe packets and statistical analysis for some duration, the proposed method provides the end-to-end QoS information much faster than the conventional methods. The measurement time of our method depends on round-trip time of the end-to-end path which is typically on the order of 101 or 102 milliseconds. In the user-centric heterogeneous wireless networking, each mobile terminal has to autonomously select an optimal PoAs (point of attachment; access point and base station) from available network candidates according to such an end-to-end QoS information to continue the services (VoIP, video conference, Web browse, etc.) since their QoS requirements are different. Therefore, the fast end-to-end QoS estimation is crucial for seamless handover among various networks with a right decision. In this paper, we have shown that our proposed method can estimate end-to-end delay and jitter with only a few milliseconds error by simulation.	attachments;bandwidth management;browsing;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;internet backbone;mobile phone;network packet;network segment;numerical analysis;quality of service;requirement;seamless3d;simulation;wireless access point	Yoshia Saito;Mikio Hasegawa;Yoshitoshi Murata	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394439	real-time computing;mobile qos;jitter;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;base station;end-to-end delay;videoconferencing;round-trip delay time;computer network	Embedded	-9.876840117278427	91.38457275731062	139315

However, managing mobility in an infrastructure network is utterly important for several reasons: controlling delay and jitter in communications, managing clients from the network, optimizing performance. We propose the concept of virtual access points to manage mobile station in infrastructure networks. In this scheme, stations are not aware that they move, and all the complexity is pushed back inside the network. It is then possible to control mobility from a global point of vue, to optimize network resources for mobile stations, hence providing a better quality of service. Finally, this scheme is compatible with existing clients without any hardware nor software modification.	anomaly detection;experiment;performance;quality of service;vue;wireless access point	Yan Grunenberger;Franck Rousseau	2010	2010 IEEE Wireless Communication and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2010.5506709	degradation;jitter;quality of service;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;prototype;mobile station;mobility model;mobile computing;computer security;wireless;computer network	Mobile	-12.7082447050462	89.22598471465459	139571

New protocols and mechanisms have been developed over recent years to offer integrated services by serving both discrete media data (such as text and graphics) and continuous‐media data (i.e. audio and video) in digital networks. Internet and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) are the main players in this area and both possess QoS architectures which allow them to integrate services of data‐ and tele‐ communications formerly performed by separate infrastructures. We believe that both will co‐exist for a significant amount of time, potentially complemented by other, perhaps simpler, approaches which are currently under investigation, such as differentiated services.

Since our mechanism operates at the network level, we expect that it will be the most expedient way to provide for seamless handovers between heterogeneous networks. We report our results which show that fast handovers with context transfer at the network layer can support uninterrupted voice over IP (VoIP). Thus, our context transfer framework will catalyze the arrival of a unified wireless telecommunications network, with voice and data connectivity anytime, anywhere. Towards that end, we describe how our results and context transfer framework relate to other work within the IETF.	anytime algorithm;seamless3d;telecommunications network	Rajeev Koodli;Charles E.

The existing TCP/IP network architecture has problems in terms of scalability and security. Therefore, to solve the traffic, scalability and security problems, novel network paradigms are being surveyed. Among these paradigms, Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is in spotlight and has shown great promise to handle these problems. We can avoid the bottleneck problem caused by many requests through this new paradigm. However, the transmission rate in CCN is a limitation when compared to the existing TCP/IP network. In order to enhance the transmission rate, we can adopt to multiple wireless interfaces available in the modern mobile device. Thus, we propose a scheme namely Parallel Multi-path Interest Forwarding Scheme in which it is possible to receive the contents more quickly compared to the existing CCN.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);cyclomatic complexity;dbpedia;internet protocol suite;mobile device;network architecture;performance evaluation;programming paradigm;real-time transcription;scalability;simulation	Doo Ho Lee;Kyi Thar;DoHyeon Kim;Choong Seon Hong	2016	2016 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2016.7427141	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;information security;operating system;parallel;distributed computing;internet protocol suite;round-trip delay time;bandwidth;wireless;server;computer network	Mobile	-11.776684392969772	90.69904204715782	140237

As bandwidth is crucial for surveillance system due to its high bit rate and restrict time constraint, we focus on the packet loss problem in this paper which is mainly caused by congestion. We propose a simple and efficient user experience based adaptive transmission control approach according to the network’s current available bandwidth, and implement Fast Downgrade Cautiously Upgrade (FDCU) algorithm. We encode video at several different image quality levels, and each level has different bandwidth requirement. Video will always be encoded at a quality level that matches current network condition. The goal is to provide user the best video image quality under the permissive bandwidth.	computer and network surveillance;user experience	Bangliang Yang;Lei Xu	2010		10.1109/ICEE.2010.423	media delivery index;image quality;user experience design;network traffic control;real-time computing;the internet;telecommunications;computer science;end-to-end delay;transmission delay;packet loss;bandwidth;server;computer network	Robotics	-6.970202713143151	99.83301229312872	140621

There are several motivations behind this concept, including: cost-effective sharing of resources; customizable networking solutions; and the convergence of existing network infrastructures. We have previously proposed a new business model for virtual networking environments. In this paper, we use this model as well as concrete use cases as basis for the definition of the Open Virtual Playground - an open virtual multi-services networking architecture in which different levels of services (i.e. essential services, service enablers, service building blocks, and end-user services) offered by various players, can be dynamically discovered, used, and composed. Furthermore, a QoS-enabled VoIP service scenario is used to demonstrate the system operation and preliminary performance measurements are collected.	control function (econometrics);quality of service;scalability;simulation;universal instantiation	May El Barachi;Nadjia Kara;Rachida Dssouli	2012	2012 IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2012.6180997	use case;business model;computer science;resource management;operating system;distributed computing;world wide web;computer network	HPC	-16.433758458847727	94.18962364735397	140808

For such services, degradation of network quality such as packet loss or delay is directly linked to the quality perceived by users. It is therefore important for network administrators to know these quality indicators for each session. However, the measurement of quality per session has become difficult due to the rapid increase of line speeds. Packet sampling techniques have been receiving much attention as a way to solve this problem, but there has been only a little discussion of packet loss in that research though it is very important. In order to determine whether quality degradations occur at particular sessions, we have proposed methods for estimating the end-to-end packet loss per session by packet sampling. In this paper, we then propose a method to determine whether the quality degradation occurs between the sending terminal and the measurement point (send segment) or between the measurement point and the receiving terminal (receive segment). The proposed method will estimate packet loss of receive segment to observe duplicate ACKs and the DATA packet with corresponding sequence number to ACK number of duplicate ACKs. Then, the packet loss of send segment can be estimated by subtraction packet loss of receive segment from end-to-end packet loss. This allows quality degradation segment to be estimated from only a 10% sample of the packet flow	acknowledgement (data networks);diversification (finance);elegant degradation;end-to-end principle;network packet;sampling (signal processing);simulation;traffic flow (computer networking)	Yasuhiro Yamasaki;Hideyuki Shimonishi;Tutomu Murase	2007	2007 International Symposium on Applications and the Internet Workshops	10.1109/SAINT-W.2007.42	sampling;link state packet;real-time computing;packet analyzer;fast packet switching;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;processing delay;transmission control protocol;end-to-end delay;transmission delay;estimation theory;packet loss;transport layer;computer network	Metrics	-5.067015296847277	90.78813177065236	140913

Intuitively, interrogation-based failure detector seems to be imprecise due to the difficulty on the estimation of two-ways transmission delay rather than heartbeat-based implementation, however it has lots of implementation advantages, for example, this style of failure detectors can simply use ICMP standard for their interaction and it is easy to monitor lots of network resources including nodes, routers and switches. We have done the experiment in a LAN and evaluated the behavior of the interrogation-based implementation for showing availability of this type of failure detectors from a practical point of view.	distributed computing;failure detector;network switch;ping (networking utility);profiling (computer programming);quality of service;requirement;sensor	Naohiro Hayashibara;Makoto Takizawa	2007	27th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW'07)	10.1109/ICDCSW.2007.62	local area network;failure analysis;detector;real-time computing;the internet;quality of service;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;internet control message protocol;computer security;transport layer;fault detection and isolation;failure detector;computer network	HPC	-7.333252633211142	92.76866512260153	140957
8297be1d2a98e67b8818dd46fbd149e2bbbb4a55	a mapping forwarding approach for supporting mobility in networks with identifier/locator separation	blocking probability;location management;mapping forwarding;identifier locator separation	SUMMARY#R##N##R##N#The identifier/locator separation has been widely recognized as a feasible solution for addressing the current Internet's routing scaling problem. Moreover, such a separation solution in terms of mobility can keep connection survivability and support global seamless roaming. A critical challenge in supporting efficient mobility is how to update the identifier-to-locator mappings of mobile nodes (MNs). In this paper, we propose a mapping forwarding (MF) scheme for location management in the identifier/locator separation architecture. In the MF scheme, a tunnel router (xTR) is selected as an agent of an MN and keeps the MN's identifier-to-locator mapping invariable by setting up an MF chain. As long as the MN is managed by the same xTR, the MN's mapping stored in the xTR of each correspondent node of the MN does not need to be updated, thus reducing the location update signaling cost. Meanwhile, the unchanged mapping assures the correct forwarding of packets, which reduces mobility-related disruption and enhances the location management's reliability. In addition, for the handoff in two MF chains, we propose a data-triggered update scheme that can achieve route optimization. To evaluate the proposed MF scheme, we establish two analytical models and formulate the blocking probability and the total protocol cost. The performance results show how the blocking probability changes under various parameters and how the MF scheme can effectively reduce the blocking probability compared with the location management scheme without the MF strategy. Meanwhile, our analysis demonstrates that the MF scheme has a lower overhead when the mobility rate is high.

Current distortion metrics are accurate, but the actual distortion values are expensive to obtain. Therefore, distortion models often assume fixed dependency patterns and neglect fragmentation issues. While this decreases runtime complexity, it also limits the application of such models to special stream classes and network environments. In response, we present a practical, efficient and format-independent framework to reason about dependencies in media streams. Based on correlation analysis we show that the estimations made by our framework match traditional distortion metrics for a number of H.264 encoded streams. Performance benchmarks indicate, that our framework is applicable at very-low computational overheads.	benchmark (computing);control system;distortion;elegant degradation;error detection and correction;fragmentation (computing);h.264/mpeg-4 avc;network packet;uncontrolled format string	Alexander Eichhorn	2007	2007 IEEE 9th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing	10.1109/MMSP.2007.4412837	real-time computing;resource allocation;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;scheduling	DB	-6.459873580284246	101.7202656715301	141268

We propose a new video traffic management method for the WCS that smooths the traffic of the closed-circuit television surveillance system (CSS) video and encodes the electro-optical tracking system (EOTS) video with low complexity in real time. First, to achieve global and local traffic smoothing for the CSS video traffic, a proper bandwidth allocation interval and a minimum bandwidth for the CSS video traffic must be determined. Second, due to the increased available bandwidth after traffic smoothing, more elaborate low-delay encoding is accomplished by selecting encoding modes adaptively to compress the EOTS video efficiently with high visual quality. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to control the WCS traffic to be as flat as possible and to encode the EOTS video with low delay, even in combat and emergency scenarios. Hence, we show that to migrate to network-centric warfare successfully, the proposed method is much more suitable for the WCS than conventional video traffic management.	algorithm;cascading style sheets;closed-circuit television;codec;data compression;encode;homeomorphism (graph theory);human visual system model;network-centric warfare;real-time transcription;self-similarity;smoothing;throughput;tracking system;web coverage service	Taewan Kim;Haksub Kim	2015	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2015.140066	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;video tracking;cascading style sheets;bandwidth;statistics	Networks	-6.81041334927433	100.04227091117693	141483

These applications have QoS requirements. From the end-user's point of view, QoS should be supported end-to-end between any pair of hosts; so all elements along the path must participate in special treatment for packets to provide the required QoS. One of the promising configurations to support real-time traffics is by combining capabilities of IntServ and DiffServ architectures. However, guaranteeing end-to-end QoS over such architectures-generally composed of chains of multiple independently administered IntServ and DiffServ domains-requires the deployment of several mechanisms and many untaken steps remain on the road to achieving this. In particular, multiple networks (domains), forming a region, may consider different QoS parameters and/or manage them differently. In this paper, we deal with the problem of mapping QoS parameters and establish conditions for the guarantee of end-to-end QoS. A (generic) framework is proposed to easy the analysis of QoS mapping between Internet domains. Abstract functions are proposed to contribute to the definition of a formal system for reasoning on QoS requirements and on the relationships between QoS requirements and Service Level Specification.	differentiated services;end-to-end principle;integrated services;quality of service	Zoubir Mammeri	2005	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2005.01.008	real-time computing;mobile qos;computer science;distributed computing;integrated services;differentiated services;computer network	Networks	-13.837178150825464	94.4550481485998	141502

In other words, an average bandwidth measurement approach is used to adjust the video delivery immediately. Furthermore, the proposed cross-layer approach uses a dynamic queue adaptation for the current communication protocol of wireless multimedia networks. In addition, it is shown by NS2 simulations that the method of average bandwidth measurement does not consume any network resource, and the proposed method with dynamic queue adaptation can provide a more acceptable service quality by dynamically adapting the transmission rate.	communications protocol;image quality;network address translation;network congestion;principle of good enough;quality of service;simulation;streaming media;throughput	Lung-Jen Wang;Cheng-En Wu;Chiung-Yun Chang	2015	2015 7th International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks	10.1109/CICSyN.2015.47	multi-frequency network;real-time computing;wireless wan;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;municipal wireless network;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;wireless multimedia extensions;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Mobile	-6.510965122045233	99.19920467230237	141542
90f5ff4f8b3da246624de4b22ef17a2800486b57	qoe-driven optimization for cloud-assisted dash-based scalable interactive multiview video streaming over wireless network		In interactive multiview video streaming (IMVS), the viewers can periodically switch viewpoints. If the captured view is not available at the desired viewpoint, virtual views can be rendered from neighboring coded views using view synthesis techniques. Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) is a new standard that allows to adjust the quality of video streaming based on the network condition. In this paper, an improved DASH-based IMVS framework is proposed. It has the following characteristics. First, virtual views could be adaptively generated at either the cloud-based server or the client in our scheme, depending on the network condition and the cost of the cloud. Second, scalable video coding (SVC) is used to improve the flexibility in our system. To optimize the Quality of Experience (QoE) of multiple clients in wireless scenario, we develop a cross-layer optimization scheme. We first propose a new cache management method to selectively store the video data according to SVC structure and the clients’ requesting condition. Next, a cross-layer scheduling scheme is proposed by considering the video rate adaptation and the wireless resource allocation. The optimization problem is shown to be equivalent to the Multiple Choice Knapsack (MCKP) problem. A dynamic programming method and a low-cost greedy method are developed to solve the problem. Simulations with the NS3 tool demonstrate the advantage of our proposed scheme over the existing approach that always uses client-based view synthesis and single-layer video coding. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Variable bit-rate (VBR) video compression is generally preferred to constant bit-rate (CBR) compression because constant image quality can be provided. In contrast, CBR transport is preferred to VBR transport from the networking standpoint because of its simplicity. This paper studies the important issue of adapting VBR-compressed video for transport over a CBR channel. We focus on temporal traffic smoothing using an elastic buffer. The target image quality and the output rate of the video encoder is controlled by feedback based on the buffer-occupancy level. Previous adaptation schemes are not readily analyzable. An analyzable control-theoretic adaptation framework is proposed. It allows systematic and quantitative investigation of issues such as stability, robustness against scene changes, robustness against image-quality oscillations due to coding-mode switching, and tradeoffs between image-quality and buffer-occupancy (delay) fluctuations. Perhaps more importantly, the framework opens up many new possibilities for further research.	case-based reasoning;channel (communications);data compression;encoder;image quality;smoothing;telecommunications network;theory;variable-length buffer;volume boot record	Soung Chang Liew;Derek Chi-yin Tse	1998	IEEE/ACM Trans.

The scheme proposed in (Z. Zhang et al., 2004) claimed that it can reduce the client buffer requirement and the server network bandwidth of mirrored-pyramid broadcasting scheme (H.S. Ma et al., 2000) without increasing the client access latency. The idea in (Z. Zhang et al., 2004) itself is good and has the potential to achieve the claimed good performance. However, the mismatch between the video segmentation and broadcasting protocol leaves the results problematic. We present the remedy in this paper and analyze the performance of the revised broadcasting protocol. We compare the revised protocol with the enhanced mirrored-pyramid broadcasting protocol (H.S. Ma et al., 2000); the results show that the revised protocol does improve the client buffer requirement without sacrificing the server bandwidth and client access latency.	apb;client (computing);data rate units;pyramid (geometry);server (computing)	Haibin Lu;Junqiang Lan;Xinhua Zhuang	2004	IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Multimedia Software Engineering	10.1109/MMSE.2004.23	broadcasting;communications protocol;real-time computing;computer science;multimedia;video processing;broadcasting;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Security	-7.056300896653339	100.32799670131355	142048

More emphasis on quality is being placed on communications equipment manufacturers and network providers alike to provide high quality user experience for applications such as IPTV and VoIP. One of the solutions is the Metro Ethernet network. In this paper, we present the results of the first phase of the Iran Telecommunication Research Center Broadband Ethernet Simulation (ITRC-BES) project which is defined by Iran Telecommunication Research Center Next Generation Network (ITRC-NGN) Group based on the Data Communication of IRAN Organization Network (DCI) requirements. We analyze performance parameters of both VoIP and IPTV traffic flows in a selected hybrid topology with OPNET. This topology contains RPR layer 2 rings called regions which are connected with each other by the IP/MPLS layer 3 routers. VPLS is configured in the network among interactive regions and both IPTV and VoIP traffic are assigned to the appropriate LSPs. Results show that QoS and service differentiation configuration in such a network are necessary topics. In addition, although, QoS mechanism can improve the quality of VoIP, the IPTV flows quality is significantly decreased by the adding more than 300 IPTV users to the network.	data, context and interaction;display resolution;ip camera;iptv;metro ethernet;multiprotocol label switching;network topology;next-generation network;quality of service;requirement;resilient packet ring;router (computing);simulation;user experience;virtual private lan service	M.

The difficulty lies in obtaining accurate R-D (rate-distortion) curves for leaky prediction based FGS (L-FGS) due to the dependency among video frames. In this paper, we propose an accurate RD model, which considers not only the distortion introduced in the current frame and the propagated distortion from the reference frame due to rate adaptation, but also the correlation between them. Based on our proposed R-D model, a sliding window technique is further developed to solve the problem of constant quality constrained bit allocation. The entire system is a combination of offline and online processes. During the offline stage, we perform the L-FGS encoding and collect the necessary feature information for the later online R-D estimation. At the online stage, given the transmission bandwidth at that time, we quickly estimate the RD curves of a sequence of consecutive video frames based on the proposed R-D model and then perform the corresponding bit allocation using the sliding window. An excellent property of our proposed R-D model is that even when applying the model for a long video sequence without any update of the actual distortion values, the estimation error is still negligible and the error is not accumulated. Experimental results show that the proposed R-D model is very accurate and the corresponding bit allocation algorithm can achieve much more smooth video quality than the traditional uniform bit allocation under both CBR (constant bit rate) and VBR (variable bit rate) channels.	algorithm;bisection method;data compression;distortion;online and offline;reference frame (video);ruby document format;scalability;truncation;video;volume boot record;whole genome sequencing	Jianhua Wu;Jianfei Cai;Chang Wen Chen	2007	J.

Our intention is to give a more realistic view on how voice capacity varies in a WLAN environment. To this goal we conducted several parallel studies comparing results based on real speech to those based on the ITU-T Rec. P.59 artificial conversational model. The studies include the use (or not) of silence suppression, distributed and centralized access mechanisms, and a variety of speech conditions. The results show, importantly, that indeed capacity based on real speech differs from that obtained using the artificial model. The reasons for this difference goes beyond observed differences in activity levels. It depends on secondary statistical characteristics of traffic and on the (random) sampling of conversations. With the study we are also able to compare the relative benefits of different approaches to increase capacity.	activity recognition;centralized computing;race condition;sampling (signal processing);zero suppression	Sean A.

Many schemes eliminate the use of CoA at the micro-mobility scale, but leave the macro-mobility unsolved. This paper proposes a novel alternative IPv6 mobility scheme based on universal addressing - Cellular Universal IP (CUIP) - for real-time traffic in wireless access networks. In CUIP, a mobile node is addressed with a universal IP address regardless of its location, making CoA and tunneling unnecessary in micromobility and even macromobility handoffs. CUIP manages roaming and handoff differently - whereas explicit signaling is used for roaming, a handoff-on-the-fly route-update scheme is used during handoff to embed signaling information into the outgoing data packets to minimize handoff delay. We prove analytically that, on average, fewer than three routers need to be updated per handoff. As a result, CUIP incurs an expected network layer handoff delay on the order of milliseconds only. In addition, the support of QoS is possible. A simple security scheme is also proposed to enable mutual authentication at the network layer.	access network;care-of address;download;mobile ip;mutual authentication;network packet;quality of service;real-time clock;router (computing);tunneling protocol	Patrick P.

In this paper we investigate the environmental- and energy-related impacts of these two methods of movie content delivery. We compare the total energy consumed and the carbon footprint impact of these two delivery methods and find that the non-energy optimized streaming of a movie through the Internet consumes approximately 78% of the energy needed to ship a movie, but has a carbon footprint that is approximately 100% higher. However, by taking advantage of recently proposed """"greening of IT"""" techniques in the research literature for the serving and transmission of the movie, we find that the energy consumption and carbon footprint of streaming can be reduced to approximately 30% and 65% respectively of that of shipping.

We modeled users' participation choices in mobile data services of different quality levels with a pricing model composed of generalized demand functions over user types and a two-part tariff. Applying survey data from the Korean mobile market, we estimated the level of user demand to evaluate the existing third generation (3G) and LTE tariffs and to forecast the market segmentation between them. The results show that the switch to LTE depends on a combination of its pricing and quality (or data rate) when a fixed fee for 3G service is offered. Moreover, the quality level of LTE is limited by the pricing. We expect our model and related empirical approaches to be useful to analyze and measure the effect of differentiated services for both operators and regulators in the telecommunications market.	compaq lte;differentiated services;emergence;expect;flat rate;uncompressed video	Moonkyo Cho;Mun-kee Choi	2012	2012 International Conference on ICT Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2012.6387152	mobile qos;marketing;business;mobile business development;commerce;mobile payment	SE	-14.296795797253742	99.77058823084644	144212

However, if agent-based solutions to network management problems are to be successful then it will be important that heterogeneous agents and agent platforms inter-operate in accordance with internationally accepted standards. Although standards of this nature are being developed, they are not tailored specifically to the needs of the telecommunications domain, with the result that important issues, such as support for the operation of agent systems in real-time constrained environments, do not seem to be adequately addressed. We present two agent-based systems for control of traffic load and resource allocation in Intelligent Networks. One of these strategies is based on the concepts of ‘Market-based Control’, the other on the concepts of ‘Ant Colony Optimisation’. Using the market-based strategy as an example we show that enhancements to existing FIPA specifications would be required to implement these strategies in order to satisfy their real-time operation constraints. We also suggest a number of potential enhancements to FIPA specifications that would alleviate some of the identified problems. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

While this popular view does not tell the whole story behind the early beginnings of IXPs, what is true is that since around 1994, the number of operational IXPs worldwide has grown to more than 300 (as of May 2013), with the largest IXPs handling daily traffic volumes comparable to those carried by the largest Tier-1 ISPs. However, IXPs have never really attracted much attention from the networking research community. At first glance, this lack of interest seems understandable as IXPs have apparently little to do with current """"hot"""" topic areas such as data centers and cloud services or Software Defined Networking (SDN) and mobile communication. However, we argue in this article that, in fact, IXPs are all about data centers and cloud services and even SDN and mobile communication and should be of great interest to networking researchers interested in understanding the current and future Internet ecosystem. To this end, we survey the existing but largely fragmented sources of publicly available information about IXPs to describe their basic technical and operational aspects and highlight the critical differences among the various IXPs in the different regions of the world, especially in Europe and North America. More importantly, we illustrate the important role that IXPs play in today's Internet ecosystem and discuss how IXP-driven innovation in Europe is shaping and redefining the Internet marketplace, not only in Europe but increasingly so around the world."""	access network;cloud computing;data center;definition;e-commerce;ecosystem;future internet;national science foundation network;noise shaping;software-defined networking;tier 1 network	Nikolaos Chatzis;Georgios Smaragdakis;Anja Feldmann;Walter Willinger	2013	Computer Communication Review	10.1145/2541468.2541473	simulation;computer science;peering;computer security;internet exchange point;computer network	Networks	-17.7058254522648	96.92601135215816	144279

The application (APP) layer 802.11e medium access control (MAC) layer, and physical (PHY) layer of the wireless protocol stack can be jointly designed for the exchange of information. This will optimize the performance of wireless network for real-time digital video transmission. This paper proposes an innovative ‘QoS-Optimized Adaptive Multi-layer (OQAM)’ architecture. It ensures reliable and high-quality video transmission over communication channels. The channel exhibits wide variability in throughput, delay, and packet loss. The simulation is performed using EvalVid and Network Simulator-2. Enhanced Intra Prediction (EnIP) algorithm with H.264/MPEG4 Advanced Video Coding (AVC) is proposed at the APP layer. This H.264/MPEG4 AVC is a non-scalable video enCOder/DECoder (CODEC). Improved MAC Adaptive Retry Limit (IMALr) is proposed as smart-packet drop mechanism at the 802.11e MAC layer. It uses packet overflow drop (Pov) and expired-time packet discard (Pex) algorithm. Enhanced Adaptive Forward Error Correction (EnAFEC) is proposed at the PHY layer. The aforementioned algorithms are jointly considered in the proposed OQAM architecture, which increases the coding efficiency, reduces end-to-end delay and increases reliability of wireless network for real-time Video over Wireless (VoW) transmission. 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The path leading to a global framework contains many obstacles, technical and political, that must be overcome to achieve new generation network features such as pervasive computing. While creating a new framework implementation focused on extensibility, we have found some issues in Diameter, the state-of-the-art AAA framework in Internet. This paper summarizes the fundamentals of a AAA architecture, then presents our implementation waaad and our findings on Diameter limitations. It shows that Diameter is suitable for AAA in the future, but some problems must be addressed first. The next phase-in our evaluation of the Diameter framework is the deployment of our implementation in a multi-realm environment, one step closer to a global AAA framework.	aaa (video game industry);authentication;authorization;control flow;diameter (protocol);emergence;extensibility;internet;software deployment;ubiquitous computing	Sebastien Decugis	2009	2009 Ninth Annual International Symposium on Applications and the Internet	10.1109/SAINT.2009.57	computer science;operating system;distributed computing;authorization;programming language;world wide web;computer security;ubiquitous computing;computer network	Arch	-14.090104787339522	90.92645944485639	144621

Several studies have presented a deep characterization of a particular application, or a particular network, considering the point of view of either the ISP, or the Internet user. In this paper, we take a different perspective. We focus on three European countries where we have been collecting traffic for more than a year and a half through 5 vantage points with different access technologies. This humongous amount of information allows us not only to provide precise, multiple, and quantitative measurements of """"What the user do with the Internet"""" in each country but also to identify common/uncommon patterns and habits across different countries and nations. Considering different time scales, we start presenting the trend of application popularity; then we focus our attention to a one-month long period, and further drill into a typical daily characterization of users activity. Results depict an evolving scenario due to the consolidation of new services as Video Streaming and File Hosting and to the adoption of new P2P technologies. Despite the heterogeneity of the users, some common tendencies emerge that can be leveraged by the ISPs to improve their service."""	asymmetric digital subscriber line;download;emergentism;fiber to the x;file sharing;internet;marginal model;megabyte;peer-to-peer;point of view (computer hardware company);semiconductor consolidation;social network;streaming media;telecommunications link;throughput;upload	José Luis García-Dorado;Alessandro Finamore;Marco Mellia;Michela Meo;Maurizio M.

The video quality estimation model proposed in this document uses the encoded bit rate and frame rate of the compressed video, along with the expected packet loss rate of the channel, to predict the subjective video quality. The model was designed as a video quality planning tool and requires prior knowledge of or assumptions about the video and channel parameters. This paper considers the use of the G.1070 video quality estimation model for monitoring applications, where the input parameters themselves must be estimated from the observed bitstream. We address the issues that arise when estimating these video and channel parameters from a real-time video stream.	bitstream;data compression;network packet;real-time locating system;streaming media	Niranjan D.

One of those applications will be digital interactive television, relying on a generic protocol solution to provide broadcasting and interaction over network dependent protocols. A digital television transmission, based on a MPEG2 transport stream consists of multiplexed video, audio and Service Information (SI) streams. Service information is important for describing the content of a transport stream and encapsulating various protocols. Because plenty of research work is done on pure MPEG2 audio and video transmissions, this paper deals with service information transmissions, its mechanisms and network requirements if broadcasted over the Internet only. For this reason a DVB-SI broadcast protocol stack will be introduced. UDP and RTP with its packetization schemes will be evaluated and bandwidth consumptions, boundaries and requirements in a LAN/WAN environment evaluated. Finally a software framework for transmission and decoding SI will be presented.	digital video broadcasting	Artur Lugmayr;Seppo Kalli	2000		10.1007/3-540-40019-2_9	local area network;the internet;digital television;telecommunications;computer science;software framework;interactive television;computer security;broadcasting	ECom	-15.774122079356742	97.35782273489828	145105

Their functionality is similar to online 3D games but differs in that users are able to construct the environment their avatars inhabit and are not constrained by predefined goals. From the network perspective metaverses are similar to games in that timeliness is important but differ in that their traffic is much less regular and requires more bandwidth  This paper contributes to our understanding of metaverse traffic by validating previous studies and offering new insights. In particular we analyse the relationships between application functionality, SL's traffic control system and the wider network environment. Two sets of studies have been carried out: one of the traffic generated by a hands-on workshop which used SL; and a follow up set of controlled experiments to clarify some of the findings from the first study. The interplay between network latency, SL's traffic throttle settings, avatar density, and the errors in the client's estimation of avatar positions are demonstrated. These insights are of particular interest to those designing traffic management schemes for metaverses and help explain some of the oddities in the current user experience.	control system;control theory;experiment;hands-on computing;metaverse;rich internet application;sl (complexity);second life;user experience;virtual world	Iain Oliver;Alan Miller;Colin Allison	2010		10.1145/1730836.1730873	simulation;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	Metrics	-10.405596332083592	97.8486340834091	145198

One way to achieve this is to provide a constant display frame rate (e.g., 30 frames/sec) at the display station. However, due to the nature of video les and compression technique applied, video frame sizes vary signiicantly from frame to frame. Therefore, although the display frame rate is xed, data retrieval is a variable bit rate process. Conventional VOD storage servers assume a peak rate retrieval of video les. Therefore , the number of concurrent requests to the VOD server cannot be maximized. In this paper, we consider a VOD storage server which can support a xed frame rate at the display and at the same time, variable bit rates retrieval of compressed video les. We describe 1) video les layout strategy, 2) request scheduling algorithm, 3) buuering issues and, 4) various VCR features support such that the number of concurrent requests can be maximized.	algorithm;data compression;data retrieval;fast forward;file server;image resolution;input/output;quality of service;scheduling (computing);server (computing);simulation;throughput;unified model;versant object database;videocassette recorder;workstation	Siu-Wah Lau;John C.

In particular, it is necessary to specify (work)load at different system interfaces. This paper presents a generalized proceeding for load modeling, which can be used to formally describe sequences of (communication) requests at well-defined interfaces within a network. At first, the basic proceeding is applied by way of example to the modeling of primary load, i.e. load at an interface close to end-users, whereby we focus on video sources. We then tackle the challenging problem of characterizing secondary load, i.e. load as it is occurring at a lower layer interface within a protocol/service hierarchy, and for this purpose, we suggest a new approach for analytical modeling of load transformations as they are typical for communication networks. The broad applicability and the high validity of our approach to model load transformations is exemplified by means of a comprehensive case study assuming video sources and considering some load transformation corresponding to the impact within a RTP/UDP/IP protocol hierarchy.

As a result, the research effort focused on QoE assessment and modeling is constantly growing. Being one of the latest standardization activities in this domain, the ITU-T P.1201 recommendation addresses the quality predictions of TCP-based, non-adaptive streaming typically referred to as progressive download. In order to evaluate the applicability of this standard for YouTube service operating over the state-of-the-art mobile networks, we conducted an initial performance analysis of this standard while comparing it with real outputs from other previously implemented QoE studies. Our findings provided in this paper include the practical drawbacks of the P.1201 specification.	codec;digital video;download;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;profiling (computer programming);requirement;streaming media	Boris Filippov;Dominik Kovac;Dalibor Uhlir;Jiri Hosek;Marat Gilmutdinov;Sergey D.

This makes packet-level FEC attractive in networks running real-time applications like video and audio streaming. Current packet level FEC schemes are either based on simple parity check codes or Reed-Solomon codes with erasure decoding, whereas this paper considers the application of more powerful turbo codes to recover from lost packets. In particular, we investigate the capability of a newly designed Return to Zero (RZ) turbo code to reduce the packet loss rate (PLR) between the source and the destination. In the proposed implementation of the RZ turbo code packet loss recovery scheme, when a packet is lost, a burst of erasures, i.e., lost bits, is introduced into the turbo code codeword, and these erasures are recovered using the soft-decision RZ turbo decoder. Because of the RZ interleaver, the RZ turbo decoder randomizes erasure positions and recovers them quite well. Our simulations indicate that the PLR performance of the proposed RZ turbo code packet loss recovery scheme benefits from adjusting the interleaver size to accommodate the changes in the raw link PLR.	binary erasure channel;code word;error detection and correction;folded reed–solomon code;forward error correction;network packet;parity bit;public lending right;real-time clock;simulation;streaming media;turbo code	Ali Al-Shaikhi;Jacek Ilow;Xin Liao	2007	Fifth Annual Conference on Communication Networks and Services Research (CNSR '07)	10.1109/CNSR.2007.11	turbo equalizer;turbo code;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;statistics	Networks	-6.758277234469158	101.90895202651924	146000

677b02c8bfa0320d62f1ebda6854e71c154108e9	unequal importance multipath video streaming for wireless networks		Video streaming is a traditional network traffic application with high bandwidth and delay requirements. Optimizing the network infrastructure for video streaming traffic is an ongoing challenge. In this paper, we consider the case of unicast live video streaming over parallel channels with different reliability and bandwidth, for example, wireless channels. While video streaming over parallel channels was proposed before, each frame in the video data was considered to be equally important. As a result, important frames could be sent over less noisy channels, which impacts perceived video quality at the receiver. We show that by using a protocol such as the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), we can identify higher reliability channels in a set of potential channels between the video source and consumer. To maximise the experienced video quality at the receiver, we then identify more important data in the video stream and send it over the better channels. We simulate the proposed solution and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework for concurrent multipath video streaming and the performance gain of concurrent multipath transmission in wireless networks.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);bulldozer (microarchitecture);distortion;end-to-end principle;journal of multimedia;multipath propagation;network packet;optimizing compiler;requirement;simulation;software transactional memory;streaming media;unicast;video;video decoder	Qamar Hamid Naith;Hamid Reza Ghaeini;Nils Ole Tippenhauer;Alicia Triviño-Cabrera	2016	JMPT		multipath propagation;wireless network;telecommunications;computer science	Metrics	-5.917044180072568	102.04119606883258	146223

This issue becomes more important in a mobile context characterized by a large heterogeneity of radio conditions between users. We develop in this paper some flow-level models to assess the impact of different video chunk durations. Our analytical and simulation results show that smaller chunk durations can improve the video smoothness and reduce buffer starvation events. However, this would require to increase HTTP signaling and to manage many headers and URLs of video chunks. To resolve this challenge, we propose to transmit multiple chunks instead of one chunk in an HTTP request. We show that our proposal can achieve better video smoothness as the case of deploying shorter chunk duration while keeping the same number of video chunks.	ambiguous name resolution;buffer overflow;chunking (computing);hypertext transfer protocol;list of http header fields;mathematical model;simulation;streaming media	Yu-Ting Lin;Thomas Bonald;Salah-Eddine Elayoubi	2016	2016 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2016.7565112	throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;multimedia;limiting;server;computer network	Mobile	-6.75186498683842	98.1844875172955	146470

However, quite understandably, the evolution has been distinctly characterized by an increasing degree of heterogeneity along several dimensions such as the access technology, network model, device, and application requirements. This heterogeneity, in turn, imposes a significant challenge on the design of the network protocol stack, and leads to the question: how can the protocol stack at a mobile host cater effectively to the heterogeneous characteristics of the operating environment? In this article we provide an overview of AdaptNet, an adaptive protocol suite for next-generation wireless data networks. AdaptNet consists of protocol solutions at different layers of the protocol stack addressing several problems, including rate adaptation, congestion control, mobility support, and coding. A common underlying theme in the design of the protocols in the AdaptNet suite is adaptiveness to the operating environment. Through high-level discussions, preliminary results, and pointers to relevant related work, we show how AdaptNet achieves the goal of effectively addressing heterogeneity in next-generation wireless data networks.	assistive technology;communications protocol;high- and low-level;internet;network congestion;network model;operating environment;protocol stack;requirement	Ian F.

5d3449309d1fc38b99b3c6924bb16f1ec7f289e1	minimizing the effects of multi-rate wlans by adapting link adaptation and call admission interfaces	link adaptation	Link Adaptation (LA) is a term used in wireless communications to adjust the physical transmission rate of nodes according to the channel conditions it senses and optimize the bit transmission by using multi-rate transmissions. It has a direct impact on the transmissions of all active calls and can cause a general degradation on the quality of service (QoS). Besides, Call admission control (CAC) is used in the call set-up phase and it determines whether it has sufficient resources to accept a new call. However, CAC also does not work efficiently on the existence of transmission rate changes. Since IEEE 802.11 standard was not created for voice communications in first place, it brings a lot of new limitations for successfully deploying VoIP. In this paper, we propose a fast and efficient, algorithm which integrates LA interface, codecframe size adaptation and CAC interface to minimize the impact of multi-rate transmission and optimize the maximum throughput and voice quality over multi-rate WLANs.	algorithm;codec;cognitive dimensions of notations;common access card;elegant degradation;maximum throughput scheduling;quality of service;scalability	Mehmet Fatih Tüysüz;Haci Ali Mantar	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14306-9_27	real-time computing;link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network	Mobile	-6.468544605061926	99.2174632006747	147180

Because of the increased appearance of e-mail spam during the last years, it is expected that these services will get into the focus of the spam industry. Since it is necessary to cope with the individual QoS-requirements of media flows and the characteristics of varying transmission media, it might be advisable not to encrypt media flows such that intermediate and edge nodes could optimize the transmission of these flows, e.g., by protocol boosters. Moreover, currently used video-conferencing systems and real-time multimedia applications mostly lack integrated security features. We have been able to demonstrate the blending of media streams with unwanted content and have implemented an active networking service that analyzes MPEG-4 media flows. Additionally, it is capable of detecting and blocking the above mentioned attack.	active networking;alpha compositing;anti-spam techniques;antivirus software;backtrack;blocking (computing);email;encryption;group of pictures;ipsec;network packet;protection mechanism;protocol stack;real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;secure real-time transport protocol;sensor;spamming;spoofing attack;streaming media;testbed;traffic shaping;video compression picture types	Andreas Hess;Jirka Klaue	2004	Proceedings. 30th Euromicro Conference, 2004.	10.1109/EURMIC.2004.1333405	computer science;multimedia;internet privacy;computer network	Metrics	-10.76739218145446	96.19092168186734	147234

To ensure immunity to detection with existing schemes, in this attack, the attacker does not jam the target constantly; instead, it relies on our probabilistic estimation model to forecast the time when its transmission has the highest likelihood of colliding with the target's generated TCP-ACKs. Repeating this process results in a decrease of the average congestion window of the targeted due to an increased round-trip time (RTT). The rogue node and/or its colluding attackers can grab this freed bandwidth and increase their throughput. We demonstrate via ns-2 simulation the effectiveness of such attack and show how easy it is to deploy without hardware modification. We also discuss its immunity to detection by existing detection schemes and investigate some parameters that may be used in building future detection mechanisms.	greedy algorithm;jam;network congestion;radio jamming;rogue;simulation;stealth;tcp congestion control;telecommunications link;throughput	Liyi Gu;Jun Zhang;Brahim Bensaou	2014	39th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks	10.1109/LCN.2014.6925789	compound tcp;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;telecommunications;computer science;tcp hole punching;transmission control protocol;h-tcp;tcp vegas;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp sequence prediction attack;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;hidden node problem;computer network	Metrics	-4.857448202870927	91.64678960612872	147323

NEMO Basic Support (NBS) has been developed as an extension of Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) so that it succeeds to drawbacks of host-based mobility management protocol. In NBS, the moving network keeps its connectivity with its home agent (HA) through its registration procedure. In other words, the moving network is required to obtain its new address and to send its own mobility signaling to the HA for every movements. In this paper, a simple and lightweight mechanism for NEMO within Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), which is a network-based mobility management protocol, is introduced. The proposed mechanism enables a moving network to change its point of attachment at a given PMIPv6 domain without acquiring a new address and sending its own mobility signaling. Mobility service provisioning entities residing at the PMIPv6 domain are extended to support NEMO. The analytical performance analysis is conducted to demonstrate that the moving network in the proposed mechanism achieves the reduced traffic cost and handover latency compared to NBS.	attachments;digital timing diagram;entity;internet;mobile ip;mobile phone;netbeans ide;network packet;numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);provisioning;proxy mobile ipv6;router (computing);seamless3d;timing diagram (unified modeling language);tunneling protocol	Jong-Hyouk Lee;Thierry Ernst	2011	IEEE Systems Journal	10.1109/JSYST.2011.2158681	network management station;nist;telecommunications;computer science;manganese;operating system;authentication;mobility model;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-11.465498480279146	89.5611480271013	147361

However, NAPI caused serious delay and jitter in such procedures. On the other hand, many conventional real-time communication mechanisms were implemented independently to the existing network stack, and most of such mechanisms disabled the stack. There-fore, it is difficult to utilize both of real-time communication and IP communication in parallel. This paper proposed a parallel implementation method to realize both of real-time communication and IP communication simultaneously in a single computer unit. This method implement real-time network stack and IP network stack in parallel by using multiple queue functionality in a NIC (network interface card). Also, this method applied the interrupt mitigation method only to the IP stack. Therefore, this method achieved to reduce the overhead of the wide bandwidth of IP traffic, also to keep delay and jitter of real-time traffic enough small. Some experiments were conducted to measure the performance of the proposed method. The RTT (round trip time) delay of realtime communication was kept lower than 100μs even in high traffic load of 800 Mbit/s with small jitter; while the RTT of IP communication varied between 100μs to 20 ms.

Benefiting from the big data in LTE network, it is possible to make the analyses one step further into the Evolved Node B (eNBs) level. Focusing on the performance of the new generation is necessary, so we conduct detailed analysis to study the resource utilization and subscriber behavior patterns using the data over hundreds of eNBs collected from current TD-LTE network. From the perspective of the entire network, we catch the characteristics of nonuniformity and periodicity, and predict the traffic dynamics. Then a comprehensive research over distinct patterns of every eNB is investigated, the type of regions can be identified according to the time distribution of clusters. Our analysis broadens the view of network-level resource management by considering the traffic patterns. We describe empirical suggestions on network planning and resource allocation based on our observations.	big data;cluster analysis;compaq lte;principal component analysis;quasiperiodicity;traffic analysis	Ziqi Cong;Jin Xu;Yu Chen;Xiaofeng Tao	2017	2017 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2017.8330458	resource management;computer network;latency (engineering);time series;big data;network planning and design;computer science;cellular network;resource allocation;base station	Metrics	-15.055533543238475	100.11273456237605	147750

However, the actual deployment of TCP options has not yet been quantified on a large scale. After analyzing a large set of traffic traces collected at 12 different monitoring points, we find that TCP segment sizes have a bimodal distribution, not a trimodal one as reported in recent studies. We show that the overwhelming majority of senders employ the maximum segment size option, large windows do not accompany SACK deployment, and explicit congestion notification (ECN) usage is negligible.	explicit congestion notification;microsoft windows;network congestion;performance evaluation;software deployment;tracing (software)	Kostas Pentikousis;Hussein G.

TCP is greedy, that is, it tries to exhaust the entire bandwidth. Thus, video streaming over TCP tends to unnecessarily take bandwidth from competing traffic. In this paper, we first investigate the data transfer mechanisms of the current video streaming services using TCP and show that they perform data transfer at much higher rates than the video playback rate. We then propose a new transfer mechanism for video streaming over TCP, one that controls the data transfer rate based on the network congestion level and the amount of buffered video data at the receiver. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism has two characteristics lacked by current video streaming over TCP, specifically a low frequency of buffer underflow at the receiver and a lack of excessive bandwidth """"stealing"""" from competing traffic."""	arithmetic underflow;experiment;greedy algorithm;network congestion;simulation;streaming media	Hiroyuki Hisamatsu;Go Hasegawa;Masayuki Murata	2011	2011 Eighth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations	10.1109/ITNG.2011.21	compound tcp;communications protocol;throughput;the internet;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;telecommunications;computer science;tcp hole punching;transmission control protocol;h-tcp;internet privacy;zeta-tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;network congestion;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;transport layer;bandwidth;server;computer network	Metrics	-4.839599297655903	95.30276343709166	148085

However, one issue that has not been looked into is considering human perception in deciding a transmission strategy for 3D objects. Many factors, such as the number of vertices and the resolution of texture, can affect the display quality of 3D objects. When the resources of a graphics system are not sufficient to render the ideal image, degradation is inevitable. It is therefore important to study how individual factors will affect the overall quality, and how the degradation can be controlled given limited bandwidth resources and possibility of data loss. In this paper, the essential factors determining the display quality are reviewed. We provide an overview of our research on designing a 3D perceptual quality metric integrating two important ones, resolution of texture and resolution of mesh, that control the transmission bandwidth. We then suggest alternative strategies for packet 3D transmission of both texture and mesh. These strategies are then compared with respect to preserving 3D perceptual quality under packet loss.	elegant degradation;graphics;mesh networking;network packet;texture mapping;vertex (graph theory)	L.

Nevertheless, how to design an effective mechanism for mitigating video quality degradation in a lossy network environment is still not thoroughly resolved yet. Unlike conventional client-server paradigm, there is data availability problem in swarm-based P2P streaming system. If we directly conduct the importance-first scheduling strategy (i.e. let the chunks with most distortion-rate efficiency get scheduled first) in swarm-based P2P streaming system, the serious content bottleneck for low priority chunks occurs, particularly when the population size is large. To cope with the above issue, in this work, we propose a dynamic strategy-switching approach that combines the advantages of random scheduling and importance-first scheduling. Our simulation results indicate that compared with existing approaches our approach not only provides better scheduling efficiency, but also is scalable even if population size is large.	client–server model;distortion;elegant degradation;emoticon;lossy compression;peak signal-to-noise ratio;peer-to-peer;programming paradigm;scalability;scheduling (computing);server (computing);simulation;swarm	Chun-Yuan Chang;Cheng-Fu Chou;Ming-Hung Chen	2011	2011 Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP)	10.1109/VCIP.2011.6115906	fair-share scheduling;detector;real-time computing;population size;distortion;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;video quality;peer-to-peer;distributed computing;scheduling;bandwidth;client–server model;server;computer network	DB	-7.725090608105792	101.60274766520773	148428

The key issue is how to enable ad-hoc users to learn about the policies offered by a particular provider and to facilitate a negotiation between the provider and the potential user. Researchers working on the pricing of network services have offered solutions based on game theory techniques, market-based mechanisms (for example auctions) and techniques based on mesh networks among others. We argue that the Network Management field, and in particular, the policy based management paradigm provides excellent ideas that can be borrowed and adapted to the field of ubiquitous or pervasive services pricing. This paper explores the prospects of using policy-based mechanisms to adequately price ubiquitous network services.	game theory;hoc (programming language);mesh networking;next-generation network;pervasive informatics;programming paradigm;ubiquitous computing	Jairo A.

Satellites are multiple access systems with very limited transmission capacity compared to terrestrial network nodes. Therefore, end-to-end resource management for such systems is key to deliver acceptable Quality of Service (QoS) to services while providing adequate efficiency. We study in some details, using simulations, a method integrating Bandwidth on Demand with Call Admission Control in geostationary satellite networks with an on board switch. In particular, we describe a set of algorithms and study the impact of different types of bandwidth reservation on the QoS received by the connections and the network efficiency.

Most of the architectures focus on minimizing bandwidth requirements under the assumption that clients play from beginning to end, but this assumption is not suitable for time-shifted TV. Moreover, they have been proposed on an IP network, and failed to make full use of the broadcasting property of hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) network. In this paper, we propose a novel delivery scheme, named as piecewise patching (PP), to tackle these problems. The piecewise patching scheme provides the video data for the users in a piecewise mode instead of a whole patching stream which includes all missing data. The former user can utilize the data from the later users' patching stream whose playback time is in advance of the former user's patching stream. In the proposed scheme, each client receives the data simultaneously from arbitrary channels which broadcast the same content. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the performance of time-shift TV service significantly in terms of total server bandwidth requirement.	computation;elegant degradation;hybrid fibre-coaxial;missing data;multicast;multilevel model;overhead (computing);patch (computing);requirement;server (computing);simulation;versant object database	Wei Xiang;Gang Wu;Qing Ling;Lei Wang	2007	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2007.4341562	real-time computing;index term;missing data;telecommunications;computer science;hybrid fibre-coaxial;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-7.021386201784703	97.14544186163616	149040

In DETS, sending machines monitor and regulate their transmission rates to conform to target rates. The DETS system is implemented in the host system, and there is no need to change or modify any processing or networking hardware. We describe an implementation on a Linux-based cluster, and through experimental performance evaluations, we show that DETS can guarantee the access rate of virtual machines.

Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) comes at a time when the need to communicate is at its highest. Designed to provide throughput similar to that of wired networks, WiMAX wireless and mobility features promises hope to underserved areas. WiMAX Mesh topology connects subscribers to the Internet without being connected to the Base Station (BS). Without relying on basic infrastructure like roads, tunnels or network backbones, WiMAX mesh will provide answers to long existing connectivity demands for underserved areas. This paper proposes a different approach, one that will lower the subscriber's cost and hence help to bridge the divide by using communities to set mesh networks and eliminate the 'middleman'. It provides insight into WiMAX, citing its mesh capabilities as the key-enabling factor in bridging the divide. The results found from a survey conducted about the problems facing developing countries are incorporated and used to show how this topology will suite developing countries' environments.	bridging (networking);internet;interoperability;mesh networking;microwave;throughput	Eliamani Sedoyeka;Ziad Hunaiti;Mohammad Al Nabhan;Wamadeva Balachandran	2008	2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications	10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493680	wimax;wireless mesh network;developing country;telecommunications;computer science;base station;mesh networking;operating system;access network discovery and selection function;computer security;computer network	Visualization	-18.857163961607082	91.29370295232293	149708

Hence, numerous mobile operators on the globe have experienced huge traffic increases in their networks. Network overload and network congestion have become frequent events. Such a deprivation also degrades the service experience by the users, which typically denoted as Quality-of-Experience (QoE). A closer look at these smartphone platforms rapidly reveals that both systems still apply mainly RF technologies introduced several years ago, such as 3G UMTS or HSDPA. This characteristic is remarkable in the context of network congestions. While the current RF technologies are already capable to support even rich-media application with large amounts of data traffic, they fill up the networks. Future Mobile systems use even more sophisticated RF techniques, such as LTE or future MIMO-OFDM based systems, and might generate even higher amounts of data traffic. This development may lead to accelerated network congestions as long as current backhaul and core net-works with today’s mechanisms for traffic management are used. As a result, the backhaul and core network architecture of next generation mobile systems, using LTE RF technology, was also new designed and is now designated as the EPC (Evolved Packet Core). The approach to adopt the Internet Protocol (IP) technology in the LTE/EPC architecture might enable the rapid deployment of “converged” IP-based application (ideally an IP-based application doesn’t depend on the underlying connectivity) and the re-use of well-known IP traffic management techniques, but has also mixed blessing. The increased transparency of LTE/EPC for IP-based traffic may scrutinize the business cases for LTE/EPC [Fran09] and the currently IP protocols still fall short for means for practical mechanisms quality assurance for data transport. Moreover, users don’t distinguish any more between wired and wireless systems. They take the seamless behavior and experience of services or applications for granted. As a result, they demand the same QoE for any applications in mobile and wireless systems as in today’s Internet using wired access technologies. A major trend in today’s Internet the increased popularity of Internet streaming video websites and service, such YouTube or Hulu. While these streaming websites were in their beginning small and implemented as garage or student projects using simple server technologies, they have now grown to huge service networks, even in their size comparable to Tier-1 networks and denoted as “hyper giants”. Generally, these service networks are denoted as Content Distribution Networks (CDN). Typically, CDNs are implementing their services based on Internet’s end-to-end paradigm without the collaboration of the underlying data transport systems. Hence, the CDN services are denoted as “over-the-top (OTT)” application. Considering this characteristic, CDNs treat mobile systems as just another access network to 2011 35th IEEE Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops 46 978-0-7695-4459-5/11 $26.00 © 2011 IEEE DOI 10.1109/COMPSACW.2011.101 which they connecting. However, the way of interconnecting network is essential as the difficulties of inter-domain traffic engineering shown. Thus, the questions remains open how the interconnection of future LTE/EPC-based mobile network with CDNs can be implemented such the QoE of users and the resource management of mobile network operators are fulfilled. We denoted this objective as the aim of sustained multimedia experience. In this talk we discuss trends for mobile service evolution and research trends for the Future Internet. In particular, we will consider an example for video content distribution in in the Internet and in mobile network and discuss what one learn from recent results from Future Internet research for this use case.	access network;android;backhaul (telecommunications);compaq lte;content delivery network;digital distribution;digital video;electronic product code;end-to-end encryption;future internet;inter-domain;interactive media;interconnection;internet access;internet research;mimo;mimo-ofdm;network architecture;network congestion;next-generation network;over-the-top content;programming paradigm;radio frequency;seamless3d;semantic network;server (computing);smartphone;software deployment;streaming media;ios	Kurt Tutschku	2011	2011 IEEE 35th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops	10.1109/COMPSACW.2011.101	mobile broadband;mobile broadband modem;mobile identification number;mobile search;mobile qos;the internet;3g;mobile web;mobile telephony;imt advanced;internet access;public land mobile network;gsm services;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;multimedia;internet privacy;mobile station;mobile computing;mobile communications over ip;radio frequency;wireless;computer network;mobile payment	Metrics	-15.264980795986707	91.56066746807723	149908

In this paper, we show how QoS can be estimated for Web services and their composition using finite state models. We also discuss how different machine learning algorithms can be applied for evaluating QoE of Web services based on known QoS parameter values.	algorithm;finite-state machine;input/output;machine learning;quality of service;scalability;web service;world wide web	Olga Kondratyeva;Natalia Kushik;Ana R.

Conversely, mobile network operators  only offer low bit rate data services to their 2.5G users, and 3G will not be in full swing for another couple of years. In  this context, the cooperation between a mobile telecommunication network and a broadcast network can be a suitable alternative  to enhance this offer with high speed e-mail, web browsing, file download or even peer-to-peer services. This paper presents  a network architecture based on the coupling of a GPRS uplink with a DVB-T downlink, to provide Internet connectivity for  unicast and multicast services. We first study the GPRS network and show the issues raised by specific use of this return  channel. Then, we analyse, using simulations, how to tune the TCP parameters to increase the GPRS/DVB-T hybrid network performances.  Finally, we describe the network architecture of the deployed system, and evaluate its performances.  	internet protocol suite;performance	Davy Darche;Francis Lepage;Eric Gnaedinger	2004		10.1007/0-387-23150-1_4	embedded system;network architecture;computer science;tcp hole punching;distributed computing;zeta-tcp;tcp tuning;computer network	Robotics	-14.59766497472517	91.16291061861358	150168

Seamless mobility ultimately allows users to transparently access all of their data and services in a consistent method. This article describes an implementation of a network-based architecture for seamless mobility services that supports the full range of applications voice, data, video, and messaging - using bimode devices that interface to both Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) networks. This solution provides advanced functionality to existing cellular devices, while providing a solid migration path to full IP-based multimedia services.

Rate-distortion (RD) models for the encoded streams are often used to control the video encoders. Buffering at the output of encoders is one of the several techniques used to smooth out the fluctuating bit rate of compressed video due to variations in the activity of video contents. In this paper, a statistical multiplexer is proposed where a closed-loop control of both video encoders and buffers is performed jointly. First, a predictive joint video encoder controller accounting for minimum quality, fairness, and smoothness constraints is considered. Second, all buffers are controlled simultaneously to regulate the buffering delays. This delay is adjusted according to a reference delay constraint. The main idea is to update the encoding rate for each video unit according to the average level of the buffers, to maximize the quality of each program and effectively use the available channel rate. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme yields a smooth and fair video quality among programs thanks to the predictive control. A similar buffering delay for all programs and an efficient use of the available channel rate are ensured thanks to the buffer management and to the predictive closed-loop control.	bandlimiting;control theory;data compression;distortion;encoder;fairness measure;multiplexer;multiplexing;rate–distortion theory;ruby document format;simulation;streaming media;transmitter;volume boot record	Nesrine Changuel;Bessem Sayadi;Michel Kieffer	2012	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2012.2190195	video compression picture types;scalable video coding;real-time computing;peak signal-to-noise ratio;uncompressed video;telecommunications;computer science;block-matching algorithm;video processing;rate–distortion optimization;model predictive control;digital video broadcasting;multiplexing;encoding;computer network;multiview video coding	Embedded	-5.261667285704289	100.821609754399	150733

The driving principle of our scheme is to guarantee the Intra-Sync speech timing relationships (hence the speech quality) and to adjust the video Intra-Sync and the Inter-Sync accordingly. Towards this aim we use a preventive control for the speech stream and a reactive control for the video stream. More precisely, we use an adaptive playout algorithm that keeps the IntraSync constraints within the talkspurts, while the network jitters are compensated by modifying only the silence perio d lengths on the basis of both speech and video packet delays. We implemented our scheme in a prototype, which allowed us to test the effectiveness of our solution. Actually, we could appreciate both perfect speech intelligibility and very satisfactory user perceived lip-sync. The latter is becaus e the Inter-Sync error is concentrated only at the beginning of the talkspurts, where known experimental tests have shown that it is not detectable.	algorithm;intelligibility (philosophy);network packet;playout;prototype;streaming media	Ivano Bartoli;Giovanni Iacovoni;Fabio Ubaldi	2007	Journal of Multimedia	10.4304/jmm.2.4.1-9	real-time computing;index term;telecommunications;computer science;world wide web;intelligibility;computer network	OS	-5.647338981068312	98.60591102012081	151237

The purpose of this paper is to benchmark the performance capabilities of wireless Web servers in such an environment. Network traffic measurements are conducted on an in-building IEEE 802.11b wireless ad hoc network, using a wireless-enabled Apache Web server, several wireless clients, and a wireless network traffic analyzer. The experiments focus on the HTTP transaction rate and end-to-end throughput achievable in such an ad hoc network environment, and the impacts of factors such as Web object size, number of clients, and persistent HTTP connections. The results show that the wireless network bottleneck manifests itself in several ways: inefficient HTTP performance, client-side packet losses, server-side packet losses, network thrashing, and unfairness among Web clients. Persistent HTTP connections offer up to 350% improvement in HTTP transaction rate and user-level throughput, while also improving fairness for mobile clients accessing content from a wireless Web server. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

HAS content is temporally segmented, and encoded at different quality representations, allowing the video player to autonomously adapt to network conditions by adapting play-out quality between subsequent segment downloads. However, to guarantee continuous playback, current-generation HAS protocols require a large play-out buffer. This makes them ill-suited for live television, as it significantly increases the live signal delay. This paper proposes a novel HAS solution for live streaming services. A HAS video player was designed that can cope with buffers as small as 2 seconds. This obviously requires the player to more rapidly react to bandwidth changes, which was achieved by using the Scalable Video Coding (SVC) extension of the H.264 Advanced Video Coding (AVC) video codec. Moreover, an intelligent network proxy was developed that guarantees the delivery of the SVC base quality layer using Differentiated Services (DiffServ). Furthermore, a more dynamic deadline-based approach is proposed which allows the client itself to decide which segments should be prioritized based on the risk of running into a buffer starvation. This enables more efficient use of the prioritized channel, leading to less freezes and increased quality and stability. The combination of these technologies allows the video player to align its quality adaptation decisions to the available bandwidth more efficiently and completely avoid buffer starvations. The small buffer size also reduces the total live signal delay from multiple dozens to only a few seconds.	align (company);codec;differentiated services;firewall (computing);h.264/mpeg-4 avc;hypertext transfer protocol;intelligent network;norm (social);scalable video coding;streaming media;temporal logic;translation lookaside buffer	Niels Bouten;Maxim Claeys;Steven Latré;Jeroen Famaey;Werner Van Leekwijck;Filip De Turck	2014	2014 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS)	10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838402	communications protocol;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;reliability;bandwidth;statistics;computer network	Networks	-6.775237775130194	98.34217259989173	151573

4c9bf4c69b4379f3839d2988aa3f3b1a2c4c8c07	an ntp-based test method for web audio delay		With the application of audio in various fields, the reliability of transmission and delay have been improved to a certain extent. However, there is no quick and effective method to test the delay of audio transmission nowadays. Therefore, it is an urgent matter to propose a reasonable method to test the audio delay. This paper takes web audio as research object, proposing a method of automatically testing web audio delay based on NTP, on the basis of which the delay of web audio is tested from two perspectives namely local delay and network delay. The experimental results show that the auto-delay testing method for web audio proposed in this paper is more flexible and efficient than other testing methods, especially for web audio testing.

A novel network-assisted technique for multihoming is introduced, enabled by the globally unique identifier (GUID) based routing in the proposed MobilityFirst Future Internet architecture, now under development. In particular, the approach shifts the burden of policy expression and data-striping from end-nodes to in-network nodes, and utilizes named object routing with GUIDs to establish multiple paths to destination mobile devices. The proposed multihoming technique uses hop-by-hop backpressure for data striping at the bifurcation router and includes a robust mechanism to reduce reordering of packets at the receive buffer. We quantify the performance gains using detailed NS3 based simulations and present results from a thorough parametric study to determine the effects of datarate, delay and hop-count difference between multiple available paths. We also show that when multiple interfaces are available, simultaneous use of both the interfaces is beneficial only under certain conditions depending on the ratio of the data-rate of the interfaces and the size of the flow.	aggregate data;algorithm;bifurcation theory;compaq lte;data striping;future internet;hop-by-hop transport;identifier;mobile device;mobile phone;multihoming;multiple homing;online locator service;requirement;router (computing);routing;simulation;throughput;unique key	Shreyasee Mukherjee;Akash Baid;Ivan Seskar;Dipankar Raychaudhuri	2014	2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136409	routing;throughput;telecommunications;computer science;out-of-order execution;distributed computing;routing protocol;multihoming;computer network	Mobile	-8.717988309390856	90.47501179766574	153157

Video on demand and multicast services have proliferated, bringing new challenges. Although the majority of the new service providers are compliant with copyright protection policies, some services are streamed without the proper rights, leading to a new kind of content piracy. Therefore, content right owners are interested in finding out the distribution channel followed by these unauthorized contents, in order to learn about illegal distributor sources. We present the first approach to this problem, in which we deal with the classification of IPTV streamed contents on satellital (DVB-S) or terrestrial (DVB-T) sources, both for live and delayed streaming. Our proposal is based on analyzing the time distribution of IP packet dispatches, extracting high-order statistics, and performing the source classification using a SVM. The reported results show the goodness of the proposed approach.	algorithm;authorization;dvb-s;digital video broadcasting;iptv;multicast;network packet;streaming media;support vector machine;terrestrial television	Miguel Masciopinto;Pedro Comesaña Alfaro	2012	2012 IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)	10.1109/WIFS.2012.6412642	multicast;telecommunications;computer science;internet privacy;computer network	Metrics	-13.040076555115636	100.63387021972487	153192

NETCONF seems to have the potential to become a feasible alternative to the established management protocols (e.g., SNMP), but few is known about its behavior and performance when it is used together with COPSPR. In this paper we present and evaluation of NETCONF and COPS-PR in a management environment for DiffServ-enabled networks. NETCONF to COPS-PR gateways have been developed in order to integrated COPS-PR commercial equipments into networks managed via NETCONF-capable management stations. Through such gateways a set of evaluations have been performed in order to draw the picture of integrated NETCONF and COPS-PR for QoS management. The results presented in this paper can help network operators in selecting adequate management setups, as well as provide guidelines for the improvement of NETCONF.	cops (software);differentiated services;pr/sm;simple network management protocol	Rafael Corezola Pereira;Lisandro Zambenedetti Granville	2008	2008 International Conference on Telecommunications	10.1109/ICTEL.2008.4652667	network management;communications protocol;quality of service;logic gate;computer science;distributed computing;information management;informatics;computer security;standardization;server;computer network	DB	-14.326680583124707	92.75165687453557	153668

On-board satellite switching is a technology designed to offer heterogeneous services, especially in demographically dispersed areas. Nevertheless, full on-board switching techniques are far from maturity. Their implementations have been proven expensive and difficult. There are also high risks involved in launching satellites for the stationary orbit surrounding the Earth. As a substitute, a satellite network with on-board cross-connect is devised in this paper. Connectivity provisioning and call admission control mechanisms associated with such a network are also presented. Simulation studies are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.		Apostolos Papathanassiou;Yi Qian;Yu Cheng;Sastri L. Kota	2006	Int. J.

The features of the network that limit its ability to carry packetized speech are discussed, and their effects on the network performance are analyzed. A new protocol, called duct routing, that enhances the network capabilities in a mobile environment is presented. That protocol makes use of repeater redundancy to compensate for loss of communication connectivity due to node mobility. A series of experiments to evaluate the network performance in carrying speech traffic, both with data and voice protocols, is described, and the results are presented and discussed.

The proposed scheme is designed to improve user experience by meeting the video quality objectives in a constrained wireless environment. To achieve this, the proposed scheme increases or decreases the video quality by taking the throughput of the available wireless link and segment download time into consideration. The algorithm decides to aggressively or conservatively increase the video quality based on the sizes of the upcoming segments. In addition, the algorithm decreases the video rate by predicting the buffer level at the download of the next segment. The results show that the proposed algorithm improves user experience by achieving high quality video and mitigating the risk of playback interruptions.	algorithm;constrained application protocol;display resolution;download;internet of things;interrupt;network switch;retransmission (data networks);simulation;throughput;timeout (computing);user experience;video	Waqas ur Rahman;Young-Seok Choi;Kwangsue Chung	2018	2018 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2018.8539416	wireless network;throughput;wireless;algorithm;video quality;user experience design;constrained application protocol;server;computer science;download	Mobile	-7.134445756805144	99.18281518654392	154567

To support and shelter different QoS models, future mobile networks should make use of an inter-network mechanism allowing the establishment of bi-lateral service level specifications (SLSs), without making any assumption about the signalling supported by internal network devices. Hence, this paper aims to explore the best way to use bi-lateral signalling to build end-to-end chains of SLSs. Two methods are evaluated. In the first one, control messages are only propagated after the establishment of an SLS between a pair of networks; in the second one control messages flow from the provider of the SLS to each of its customers, passing a chain of transit-networks.	control theory;end-to-end principle;experiment;intranet;lateral thinking;overhead (computing);quality of service;requirement;standard sea level	Eleni Kamateri;Lefteris Mamatas;Paulo Mendes;Luis Loyola	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394700	cellular network;real-time computing;mobile qos;quality of service;computer science;telecommunications service;operating system;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-12.380014209382287	90.2533368735317	154652

However, all the packets belonging to one application are handled in the same way, even though they have different impact on the perceived quality. In this article we present a standard compliant cross layer optimization for video services. The importance of a packet, signalized at application level, is used to filter packets into different logical channels with different qualities of service. Simulations performed using a HSDPA system level simulator show that our implementation increases the video quality of over 0.6 dB.	computer simulation;decibel;differentiated services;item unique identification;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;network abstraction layer;network packet;quality of service;scheduling (computing);streaming media	Luca Superiori;Martin Wrulich;Philipp Svoboda;Markus Rupp	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03819-8_14	quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;video quality;multimedia;computer network	Networks	-4.963446983416398	100.98826470165434	154742

Due to the long latency of the statistical aggregate, the predictive technique is able to predict the bit rate over about two seconds of time. The prediction information is used in an admission control system to estimate the bit rate and the margin with respect to the channel capacity in the proposed streaming system. These measures have been used to estimate the overflow probability in a general aggregate situation. Tests conducted over real video sequences confirm the feasibility of the proposed technique.	aggregate data;algorithm;bitstream;channel capacity;control system;quality of service;requirement;simulation;smoothing;streaming media;usability;volume boot record	Pietro Camarda;Cataldo Guaragnella;Domenico Striccoli	2006			computer network;computer science;communication channel	Embedded	-5.675815535255979	99.36112714479196	154770

Progress in digital signal processing component technology is offering the possibility of highly flexible radios, where most of the signal processing is performed in software. Occurring in parallel with this development is a phenomenal growth of the mobile and personal communications market. Considering these two developments, it is now very likely that software radio will have a significant role to play in third generation mobile systems. In fact, it may be the single most important concept for enabling flexibility and innovation in the next generation of mobile communications. This paper considers Software Radio issues, in terms of requirements on the network and protocols to be used, in order to ensure that Software Radio can be exploited to its full potential in third generation mobile systems. The construction of the relevant protocol architecture as well as the kinds of messages to be exchanged are studied in relation to the architectural design of third generation Abstract. Software radio will likely have a significant role to play in third generation mobile systems. The first tentative steps towards identifying the impact of software radio on a mobile network have already been taken in the RANBOW project. This paper will consider network issues related to the s o b a r e radio concept. The requirements on the network to allow the use of software radio in future generation mobile systems will be presented. Significant attention will be given to the network design required to allow software radio to be exploited to its full potential.	digital signal processing;network planning and design;next-generation network;realms;requirement	Ermanno Berruto;Pilar Diaz;Gary Fleming	1999	European Transactions on Telecommunications	10.1002/ett.4460100609	radio access network;embedded system;service;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;software-defined radio;mathematics;configuration;computer security;systems architecture	SE	-14.937594866306469	95.68053486540637	154910

As the upstream capacity of most peers is restricted, Webcasting high-bandwidth content is a continuing problem with traditional application-level multicasting techniques. Split and merge multicast provides a solution to this problem.

Thus, a significant amount of research efforts is devoted to broaden the wireless services over the globe. In this context, satellite component plays a pivotal role in extending and enhancing the existing Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). In this paper, integration of satellite communication systems with UMTS is addressed. Several integration scenarios are considered and their simulation results using Network Simulator (NS) are given. In particular, performance of integration scenarios is evaluated in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput of the system as a function of satellite orbits and UMTS configuration for a variety traffic applications (UDP/TCP) and traffic data rates. It is observed that Satellite-UMTS (S-UMTS) telecommunication networks provide acceptable delay and throughput performance. Also, due to the synergy that exists between satellite and UMTS networks, S-UMTS is a sound approach for delivering multimedia services globally.	communications satellite;end-to-end principle;network packet;profiling (computer programming);simulation;synergy;terrestrial television;throughput;transmitter	Abdulbaset M.

Due to the different characteristics between multimedia and non-multimedia webpage files, more and more proxy servers are dedicated solely to handle multimedia files. Compared with regular webpage files, multimedia files are often transmitted with the technique of streaming so uses can start viewing them as soon as they are reaching the client's site without awaiting the completion of the entire transmission. Those multimedia proxy servers are also referred to as streaming proxy servers. In general, the sizes of multimedia files are much larger than those of regular webpages. It is unlikely that a steaming proxy server can constantly store entire contents of multimedia files in its memory. As a result, the streaming proxy server needs to split individual multimedia files into segments and only stores popular segments in its memory. Researchers had proposed various ways to do the segmentation. However, the sizes of individual segments are often fixed once the segmentation is done. We argue that the sizes of individual segments should vary according to their popularity. A popular segment can have a longer length so the overall performance can be increased accordingly. We propose a novel design, Dynamic Segment Size (DSS), which dynamically adjusts the length of segments by their popularity. We apply our design to a sophisticated algorithm, Adaptive and Lazy Segmentation (ALS), which performs the work of splitting multimedia files into segments and handling memory replacement in a streaming proxy server. Through experimental simulations, our results show that DSS can help ALS increase its byte hit ratio by up to 8.15%.	algorithm;byte;hit (internet);lazy evaluation;proxy server;server (computing);simulation;streaming media;vii;web page	Tsozen Yeh;Zongwei Yang	2012	IEEE international Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting	10.1109/BMSB.2012.6264309	real time streaming protocol;real-time computing;computer science;multimedia;world wide web;server	Metrics	-7.393357619229116	97.73889494374093	155336

Anarchy Online is a science fiction-themed massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMORPG), published and developed by Funcom [7]. We present statistics from the network traffic and show that it is a representative dataset for similar games. From the dataset, one can extract several key characteristics from such scenarios like payload sizes, packet rates, data delivery latencies, retransmission statistics, loss rates and stream correlation. The dataset can be used several ways: by replaying the game traffic, components like congestion control mechanisms, middlewares, packet schedulers, router queue behaviour, etc. can be analysed. Based on the observed statistics from the trace, such interactive game traffic shows completely different behaviour compared to the greedy, high-rate streams most network mechanisms are designed for, e.g., file download, video streaming and web-surfing. We hope that the dataset can be used to push research forward in the field of system support for games.	anarchy;control system;datapath;digital footprint;download;greedy algorithm;iad;information access;most bus;massively multiplayer online role-playing game;network congestion;network packet;network traffic control;payload (computing);replay attack;retransmission (data networks);router (computing);server (computing);server-side;simulation;streaming media	Andreas Petlund;Pål Halvorsen;Pål Frogner Hansen;Torbjörn Lindgren;Rui Casais;Carsten Griwodz	2012		10.1145/2155555.2155571	traffic generation model;network traffic control;simulation;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	-8.818468651370686	96.76041481397961	155515

The relevance of this paradigm ranges from Internet protocol television to video-on-demand systems for distributing and sharing professional television (TV) and user-generated content that is consumed and produced ubiquitously. To obtain a pleasurable user experience, a large amount of aspects have to be taken into account. Major challenges in this context include the identification of relevant UX factors and the quantification of their influence on Quality of Experience (QoE). This special issue is dedicated to advances in, tools, techniques and practices for multimedia QoE that tackle several of the aforementioned challenges. It consists of six papers that address three of these topics: advanced metrics for QoE, application instrumentation for QoE assessment, and integration of QoE aspects in the complete networked multimedia production-consumption chain.

The mobility may cause the HA to be geographically distant from the mobile network, and the tunneling causes increased delay and overhead in the network. It becomes peculiar in the event of nesting of mobile networks due to pinball routing, for example, a Personal Area Network (PAN) inside a vehicle. The authors propose an Extended Mobile IPv6 route optimization (EMIP) scheme to enhance the performance of nested mobile networks in local and global mobility domain. The EMIP scheme is based on MIPv6 route optimization and the root Mobile Router (MR) performs all the route optimization tasks on behalf of all active Mobile Network Nodes (MNNs). Thus, the network movement remains transparent to sub MRs and MNNs and modifies only MRs and MNNs leaving other entities untouched and is more efficient than the Network Mobility Basic Support protocol (NEMO BS). The authors carried out an extensive simulation study to evaluate the performance of EMIP.	entity;mathematical optimization;mobile ip;next-generation network;overhead (computing);proxy mobile ipv6;router (computing);routing;simulation;tunneling protocol	Arun Prakash;Rajesh Verma;Rajeev Tripathi;Sagar Naik	2010	IJMCMC	10.4018/jmcmc.2010040101	cellular network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;mobility model;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-11.194219564181388	89.450481284853	155767

The proposed system takes into account contention at the MAC layer, wireless channel error, queueing at the MAC layer, parameters of different 802.1 le access categories (ACs), and video characteristics of different H.264 data partitions (DPs). To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first system that takes these network and video characteristics into consideration to predict video quality in an IEEE 802.1 le network. The proposed system consists of two components. The first component predicts the packet loss rate of each H.264 data partition by using a multi-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) coupled to a M/G/l queue. The second component uses these packet loss rates and the video characteristics to predict the MSE of each received video frames. We verify the accuracy of our combination system by using discrete event simulation and real H.264 coded video sequences.	algorithm;channel (communications);cognitive dimensions of notations;distortion;frame (video);h.264/mpeg-4 avc;markov chain;mean squared error;network packet;priority queue;public lending right;queueing theory;simulation;video	Werayut Saesue;Chun Tung Chou;Jian Zhang	2010	"""2010 IEEE International Symposium on """"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks"""" (WoWMoM)"""	10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5534895	lead;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;video quality;discrete event simulation;wireless network;mean squared error;block-matching algorithm;predictive modelling;markov process;queueing theory;computer network	Mobile	-4.779290350241347	102.33897144653577	155813

We first describe the construction of the test-bed based upon Internet measurements between geographically distributed hosts. Then, we present a methodology for evaluating these P2P video streaming systems by performing video quality and network usage analysis from the log information obtained via running these systems on the test-bed. Our methodology to assess P2P live video streaming systems comprises analyzing the objective quality of the received video, waiting time to receive the first data byte, and several network usage measures such as P2P protocol overhead, load on the server due to the inefficiencies of the P2P overlay, and measurements of the number of bytes exchanged between the peers. It is essential that every peer buffers packets for some time before playing out the video in order to ensure good quality. We report the time that the user has to wait before he can see the video playing. These measurements not only gauge the performance of currently available P2P streaming systems but also highlight desired improvements in current P2P video streaming systems.	byte;internet;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;server (computing);streaming media;testbed;usage analysis;video	Sachin Agarwal;Jatinder Pal Singh;Aditya Mavlankar;Pierpaolo Baccichet;Bernd Girod	2008		10.1145/1390576.1390584	real time streaming protocol;real-time computing;computer science;video quality;video tracking;peer-to-peer;multimedia;video processing;traffic shaping;computer network;testbed	Metrics	-8.636502576795566	98.0531207916313	156005
1f50d82861ce2c285c8c7888c0b83e6f31562a65	a five year perspective of traffic pattern evolution in a residential broadband access network	elektroteknik och elektronik	In this paper we describe a systematic study on long-term evolution of residential broadband Internet traffic covering 5 calendar years from June 2007 to May 2011. The traffic evolution is characterized both in the term of the total traffic volume, as well as the traffic volumes and shares for different application categories (file sharing, video streaming etc.), with the focus on comparing the traffic on the per IP user basis and among different broadband subscription groups. The results show that the average daily total traffic generated by each private end user increased only by about 33 % during the past 5 years. Further, the results show that the P2P file-sharing has been dominating the network total traffic, but the daily file-sharing traffic volume per end user largely remains the same. Also, the daily streaming-media traffic volume per end user has increased dramatically by over 500% during the studied period of time. In the meantime, the daily web-browsing traffic volume per end user has increased by about 300%. Finally, a further investigation among 4 different FTTH broadband subscription groups with 1, 10, 30, and 100 Mbit/s symmetric access speeds shows that the lower the access speed, the more diversified the end user traffic tend to be.	access network;data rate units;fiber to the x;file sharing;internet access;megabit;streaming media;web navigation	Jie Li;Andreas Aurelius;Viktor Nordell;Manxing Du;Åke Arvidsson;Maria Kihl	2012	2012 Future Network & Mobile Summit (FutureNetw)		simulation;geography;telecommunications;traffic volume;computer network	Metrics	-12.791948851043673	98.74898511033916	156101

For the scalable protocols that provide immediate service to each client when the server is not overloaded, this paper develops simple analytic models to evaluate two client-oriented quality of service metrics, namely (1) the mean client waiting time in systems where clients are willing to wait if a (well-provisioned) server is temporarily overloaded, and (2) the fraction of clients who balk (i.e., leave without receiving their requested media content) in systems where the clients will tolerate no or only very low service delays during a temporary overload. The models include novel approximate MVA techniques that appear to extend the range of applicability of customized AMVA to include questions focussed on state probabilities rather than on mean values, and to systems in which the operating points of interest do not include substantial client queues. For example, the new AMVA models accurately estimate the server bandwidth needed to achieve a balking rate as low as one in ten thousand. The analytic models can easily be applied to determine the server bandwidth needed for a given number of media files, anticipated total client request rate and file access frequencies, and target balking rate or mean wait. Results show that (a) scalable media servers that are configured with the """"required server bandwidth"""" defined in previous work have low mean wait but may have unacceptably high client balking rates (i.e., greater than one in twenty), (b) for high to moderate client load, only a 10 - 50% increase in the previously defined required server bandwidth is needed to achieve a very low balking rate (e.g., one in ten thousand), and (c) media server performance (either mean wait or balking rate) degrades rapidly if the actual client load is more than 10% greater than the anticipated load."""	approximation algorithm;emoticon;media server;model–view–adapter;multicast;peer-to-peer;point of interest;quality of service;scalability;server (computing);streaming algorithm	Haonan Tan;Derek L.

Thisis necessary to support new service concepts anddemanding capabilities of wireless communicationsystems. Although the migration to ATM-based broadbandISDN is visible, wireless ATM (WATM) internetworking formobile clients is still in its infancy. In this article,a brief overview of the current mobile communications standards GSM and DECT is presented. It isshown why these standards fail to deliver adequateperformance for multimedia data transfer. We thendescribe the recently approved IEEE 802.11 wirelesslocal area network standards and ETSI HIPERLAN 1 indetail and discuss their suitability for the transfer ofATM cells. Next, the ongoing work of the ATM Forum'sWATM Working Group and the efforts of the ETSI RES 10 regarding the further development ofHIPERLAN 2, 3, and 4 is elaborated. Finally, severalexisting WATMs are described.

A TCP session adapts the demands it places on the network to observations of bandwidth availability on the network. Because TCP is adaptive, any model of its behavior that aspires to be accurate must be influenced by other network traffic. This point is especially important in the context of using simulation to evaluate some new network algorithm of interest (e.g., reliable multicast) in an environment where the background traffic affects---and is affected by---its behavior. We need to generate background traffic efficiently in a way that captures the salient features of TCP, while the reference and background traffic representations interact with each other. This article describes a fluid model of TCP and a switching model that has flows represented by fluids interacting with packet-oriented flows. We describe conditions under which a fluid model produces exactly the same behavior as a packet-oriented model, and we quantify the performance advantages of the approach both analytically and empirically. We observe that very significant speedups may be attained while keeping high accuracy.	aggregate data;algorithm;decade (log scale);epoch (reference date);interaction;internet;multicast;network packet;network traffic control;packet switching;router (computing);simulation;speedup	David M.

Considering the source-channel characteristics of the specific case, this paper presents a novel error-resilience packet scheduling scheme based on the reference frame selection (RFS) without back-channel, which is called RFS-based packet scheduling (RFS-PS). By applying the delayed packet scheduling scheme in a group-of-picture (GOP) according to different delay requirements, the probability of simultaneous losses between different prediction chains can be reduced. Simulation results show that the proposed RFS-PS scheme can spread out burst packet losses into different chains, and effectively increase error resilience of low bit-rate video streaming over wireless channels	network packet;real-time clock;reference frame (video);remote file sharing;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;streaming media	Hao Liu;Wenjun Zhang;Xiaokang Yang	2006	2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1692622	reference frame;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;transmission delay;packet loss;scheduling;computer network	Embedded	-6.367115039416044	101.49792106354022	156779

One of the performance measures for a successful application deployment is the ability to support application-data flows by heterogeneous networks within certain delay boundaries. However, the quantitative impact of this measure is unknown and practically infeasible to determine at real time due to the mobile device resource constraints. We research practical methods for measurement-based performance evaluation of heterogeneous data communication networks that support mobile application-data flows. We apply the lightweight Comparative Output-Input Analysis (COIA) method estimating an additional delay based on an observation interval of interest (e.g., 1 second) induced on the flow. An additional delay is the amount of delay that exceeds nonavoidable, minimal end-to-end delay caused by the networks propagation, serialization, and transmission. We propose five COIA methods to estimate additional delay, and we validate their accuracy with measurements obtained from the existing healthcare and multimedia streaming applications. Despite their simplicity, our methods prove to be accurate in relation to an observation interval of interest, and robust under a variety of network conditions. The methods offer novel insights into application-data delays with regards to the performance of heterogeneous data communication networks.	end-to-end principle;mobile app;mobile device;performance evaluation;real-time computing;semantic network;serialization;software deployment;software propagation;telecommunications network;throughput	Markus Fiedler;Katarzyna Wac;Richard Bults;Patrik Arlos	2013	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2012.141	estimation;throughput;real-time computing;heterogeneous network;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;application layer;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	-11.067192256056106	95.07710377656068	156879

Layered multicast is a promising solution to accomplish this task efficiently. However, schemes using it suffer from slow convergence time, lack of inter-session fairness and TCP-friendliness, and considerable losses induced by slow response; and failed join-experiments. This paper proposes a new layered multicast with multilevel congestion marking (LM-MCM). A fundamental contribution of this scheme is introducing a multilevel congestion marking strategy (MCM) which enables a router to mark the congestion-flag field of each arriving LM-MCM packet according to the average queue size. Furthermore, based on the average congestion-flag, each receiver can improve/reduce the quality of service it receives to respond to the network congestion. We evaluated LM-MCM in a number of scenarios on NS2 simulator. The results show LM-MCM converges quickly to the optimal layer of subscription, induces less loss to track the available bandwidth, and has inter-session fairness and TCP-friendliness	active queue management;algorithm;bit field;digital video;experiment;fairness measure;internet;item unique identification;multi-chip module;multicast;network congestion;network packet;quality of service;router (computing);scalability;scalable tcp;session id;simulation;streaming media	Mengjuan Liu;Peilin Hong;Jinsheng Li;Xiaobo Zhou	2006	2006 14th IEEE International Conference on Networks	10.1109/ICON.2006.302575	real-time computing;multicast;the internet;ip multicast;inter-domain;quality of service;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;queueing theory;source-specific multicast;network congestion;transport layer;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Networks	-4.5467737601457205	95.42431876315182	156896

The new user capabilities spawn a demand for Always Best Connectivity (ABC), i.e. that a user can always have the best possible connection regardless of place and time. This brings forth a new communication paradigm, which is user-centric, i.e. the user is no longer bound to only one access network but can choose the best available access network to satisfy a specific service request. The IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) is the technology promoted to enable this ubiquitous converged network. This paper considers the selection of access network, specifically for multicast/broadcast users and proposes a novel RAN selection scheme implemented using IMS signalling.	access network;coexist (image);comparison of command shells;game theory;ip multimedia subsystem;information management system (ims);multimedia broadcast multicast service;nash equilibrium;network convergence;performance evaluation;programming paradigm;scalability;selection algorithm;simulation;spawn (computing);technological convergence;telecommunications network	Josephine Antoniou;Marinos Stylianou;Andreas Pitsillides	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394050	internet protocol;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;ip multimedia subsystem;computer network;satisfiability;access network	Mobile	-14.934780909115622	91.18317342022735	156982

In the other end, a client consumes variable-sized compressed video frames at a fixed frame rate. Between the two ends, a network channel transmits small fixed-sized cells at a constant cell rate. We propose a flow control plan with two hierarchical phases, namely, the peer-level and network-level phases. Our control plans consume both the minimum buffer space and the minimum network channel bandwidth. We conduct a set of experiments by tracing several typical video tracks, and observe a few common facts that for each video flow, (1) the client only need to enforce couple seconds start-up delay before playback (2) the minimum total buffer space required is less than 1.4Mbytes and (3) the minimum network bandwidth required is very close to the video’s average bit rate.	best-effort delivery;control theory;data compression;disk storage;end-to-end encryption;experiment;flow control (data);server (computing);set-top box;simple set	Sheau-Ru Tong;Sho-Chi Lee	1999		10.1109/MMCS.1999.778556	data compression;computer vision;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;flow control;video tracking;statistics;computer network	Networks	-5.53440495251752	100.02418921113113	157073

To support the rapidly increasing number of mobile devices in the near future, the key new capability required of the next generation Internet is to provide ubiquitous network access to the mobile users characterized by seamless access, universal coverage, and location independent services. Lack of scalable and efficient mobility aware routing protocols is one of the main challenges faced by today's Internet in supporting large numbers of mobile users. Scalability of mobile routing protocols in terms of the size of network, number of mobile users, number of corresponding hosts with simultaneous active data sessions is critical. Timely response to movement of mobiles and the ability to support efficient mobile-to-mobile communication are important characteristics that distinguish various mobile routing solutions. Reducing the burden of network configuration and management in large networks is becoming of paramount importance. These characteristics and plug and play type of network nodes and easy adaptability to arbitrary topologies will determine the winners among new mobile routing architectures and protocols.	access network;algorithm;internet;mobile device;network packet;next-generation network;operand forwarding;personal computer;personal digital assistant;plug and play;programming paradigm;router (computing);routing;scalability;seamless3d;software framework;ubiquitous computing	Hongyi Li;Gerard R.

The paper first introduces a holistic architecture that describes the key functions required to support inter-domain QoS, and then proceeds to present results from two major components of the architecture. A genetic algorithm for QoS-aware offline interdomain traffic engineering is first presented, and it is shown through simulation studies how this can optimise the apportionment of QoS provisioning between adjacent domains. Secondly, QoS enhancements to BGP are proposed and the results of a testbed implementation are described, demonstrating how this QoS-enhanced BGP can deliver inter-domain QoS routing.	border gateway protocol;genetic algorithm;holism;inter-domain;multiprotocol label switching;online and offline;provisioning;quality of service;routing;simulation;test engineer;testbed;vocabulary	Michael P.

However, its inter-frame dependency makes it difficult to use it for interactive playback modes, such as play backward, jump or fast forward/backward. A scalable streaming system is required to serve videos to a large number of clients and it should share a single server stream among many clients. However, different interactive clients generally ask for different playback sequences. Hence, their streams cannot be grouped and served together by a single server stream. Therefore, as the frequency of interaction increases, an ordinary scalable streaming service becomes a non-scalable service. In this paper, we have proposed an improved proxy-based streaming scheme over the Internet. We have used video segmentation and hybrid temporal-data-partition scalable video encoding to create suitable playback sequence for interactive playback modes. We have used prefix and smoothing buffers at the proxy to make our scheme scalable. Simulation results show that our streaming scheme remains fully scalable even when all the clients are highly interactive. By using certain part of the available server-proxy network bandwidth and proxy buffers, our streaming scheme can support large numbers of clients. As the level of interaction increases the relative bandwidth and the buffer requirement decreases.	bandwidth (signal processing);data compression;fast forward;internet;moving picture experts group;scalability;server (computing);simulation;smoothing;streaming media;volume boot record	Md.

188ba4672878795715cdc982cb81c0205cd7e330	network analysis on skype end-to-end video quality	network resources optimization;quality of experience;peer to peer;video quality assessment	Purpose – This paper aims to argue on the efficiency of Quality of Service (QoS)-based adaptive streaming with regards to perceived quality Quality of Experience (QoE). Although QoS parameters are extensively used even by high-end adaptive streaming algorithms, achieved QoE fails to justify their use in real-time streaming videos with high motion. While subjective measurements of video quality are difficult to be applied at runtime, objective QoE assessment can be easier to automate. For end-to-end QoS optimization of live streaming of high-motion video, objective QoE is a more applicable approach. This paper contributes to the understanding of how specific QoS parameters affect objective QoE measurements on real-time high-motion video streaming. Design/methodology/approach – The paper approached the question through real-life and extensive experimentation using the Skype adaptive mechanisms. Two Skype terminals were connected through a QoS impairment box. A reference video was used as input to one Skype terminal and streamed on one direction. The impairment box was stressing the stream with different conditions. Received video was stored and compared against the reference video. Findings – After the experimental analysis, the paper concludes that adaptive mechanisms based on QoS-related heuristics fail to follow unexpected changes to stream requirements. High-motion videos are an example of this variability, which makes the perceived quality sensitive to jitter more than to packet loss. More specifically, Skype seems to use if-else heuristics to decide its behavior to QoS changes. The weaknesses to high-motion videos seem to lie on this rigidity. Research limitations/implications – Due to the testbed developed, the results may be different if experiments are run over networks with simultaneous streams and a variety of other traffic patterns. Finally, other streaming clients and algorithms would contribute to a more reliable generalization. Practical implications – The paper motivates video streaming engineers to emphasize their efforts toward QoE and end-to-end optimization. Originality/value – The paper identifies the need of a generic adaptive streaming algorithm able to accommodate a big range of video characteristics. The effect of QoS variability to high-motion video streaming helps in modeling and design.	adaptive filter;best-effort delivery;byte;computational resource;emoticon;emulator;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;experiment;forward error correction;heart rate variability;heuristic (computer science);machine learning;mathematical optimization;mobile phone;nl (complexity);network packet;peer-to-peer;personalization;quality of service;real life;real-time clock;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);spatial variability;streaming algorithm;streaming media;structural similarity;testbed;three utilities problem;video;video clip	Georgios Exarchakos;Luca Druda;Vlado Menkovski;Antonio Liotta	2015	Int.

So far, no efficient solution has been proposed for the important case where the overall system is underprovisioned, that is, when peers do not have enough upload bandwidth to ensure video distribution at full quality. We design various objective functions for this upload bandwidth allocation problem and show how optimal solutions can be computed using a bipartite flow network. Simulation results show that our solutions improve on existing algorithms in terms of video quality.	distributed algorithm;elegant degradation;fairness measure;flow network;open research;peer-to-peer;provisioning;simulation;streaming media;system dynamics;upload;video	Jiayi Liu;Shakeel Ahmad;Eliya Buyukkaya;Raouf Hamzaoui;Gwendal Simon	2015	Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications	10.1007/s12083-014-0260-8	resource allocation;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer network	Networks	-9.668050273882669	95.70320893018177	157552

In one case, the satellite network is considered as a black box (Black Box BB approach). Each modification is performed within the end terminals. In the other case, the satellite network is completely known and the transport layer parameter tuning and the consequent optimization of the overall performance is not independent from the choices followed within the satellite network (Complete Knowledge CK approach). In both cases a complete parameterization of the algorithms at the transport layer is recommended to allow adaptability in different conditions. Concerning the CK approach, a first analysis proposed concerns the behavior of the queue length at IP layer in the intermediate routers. The IP buffer tuning represents a first step towards the implementation of a new transport protocol (STP Satellite Transport Protocol) adapted to various satellite environments from LEO to GEO, whose interfaces towards the upper layers will keep the characteristics of the TCP interfaces but whose performance will be strongly improved. A possible generic architecture will be reported and some possible solutions to be implemented within the network architecture will be shown along with the results obtained by means of real measures in the field .	algorithm;black box;communications satellite;mathematical optimization;network architecture;router (computing)	Mario Marchese	2001		10.1109/GLOCOM.2001.966261	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;transport layer;computer network	HPC	-12.949782532316005	93.36299353777595	157559

The NEMO basic support protocol was developed to grant the Internet connection for an entire mobile network, like vehicle or aircraft network. In NEMO a Mobile Router manages the mobility of the entire network on behalf of the other nodes in order to reduce the overhead of signaling messages. The critical part of mobility support is to reduce the handover latency, particularly when a Mobile Router is not reachable. This handover period degrades the performance of most delay sensitive applications. Referring to our proposition for NEMO handover improvement which is conceived for multiple-mobile-routers-based multihomed NEMO network, we find out a mathematical model to study the intradomain handover performance. We derive the mathematical model to analyze interruption interval (the time interval during which none of mobile routers can transport packets) during the intradomain handover. We study the impact of varying critical parameters, like vehicle speed, overlapping coverage distance, distance between mobile routers, and scanning frequency. The obtained results reveal that the seamless handover can be achieved if network configuration parameters are correctly chosen. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The advantage of cloud-based streaming service is that users can access multimedia contents from any device that is connected to the Internet. However, it is not easy to guarantee seamless streaming when the display device is switched. To switch streaming service being provided from one device to another seamlessly, adaptive rate control scheme is required by considering the network and device capabilities. However, existing stream systems do not consider both the characteristics of display devices and network status for rate control. This paper proposes an adaptive rate control scheme to improve the performance of cross-device handover in cloud-based streaming service.	cloud computing;control theory;display device;internet;seamless3d	Sunghee Lee;Kwangsue Chung	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)	10.1109/ICCE.2012.6161795	embedded system;real time streaming protocol;real-time computing;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;display device;computer network	Mobile	-10.08319227537753	96.26345302895847	157849

Even though the worst case buffer size dimensioning provides deterministic quality of service (QoS) guarantees that are desirable in multimedia transmission, however, this also over-provisions the scarce memory resources. In this paper, we propose a dynamic technique for buffer and rate allocation under two scenarios: 1) when the channel conditions are known a-priori, and 2) when the channel conditions are unknown. Simulation results show up to an order of magnitude savings in the application layer buffer requirements for the two scenarios considered. Furthermore, a-priori knowledge of the channel conditions at the application layer yields an improved video quality.	best, worst and average case;mathematical optimization;quality of service;requirement;simulation;streaming media;video	Azfar Moid;Abraham O.

The association of personal and local area networks along with the 3.5G network is a critical factor for successful development of pervasive e-health services perceived by end-users. In this paper, we propose a methodology for performance assessment based on the joint uplink transmission of voice, real-time video and biomedical data, such us electrocardiogram, vital signals and heart sounds. Various scenarios were concerned for point of care applications in real-time and near-real-time modes and in random locations, where no other system but 3.5G is available. The accomplishment of quality of service (QoS) was explored through the delay and the jitter of the networks' parameters, attributing the joint network system for best performance in the context of the desired e-health services.	bluetooth;compaq lte;internet backbone;pervasive informatics;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;requirement;telecommunications link;trust (emotion)	Dimitris Komnakos;Demosthenes Vouyioukas;Ilias Maglogiannis;Charalabos Skianis	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962685	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;mobile computing;computer security;computer network;data transmission	Robotics	-11.992639061886106	94.87523344111268	158121

It provides mechanisms to manage continuity of IMS services, particularly the seamless transfer of multimedia sessions across different access networks, different domains, and the mobility of ongoing sessions across devices of the same user. Functionally, it is mobility management at the IMS services and applications layer when terminal and session mobility events are visible to the IMS. Although mobility management is a thoroughly explored and extensively documented area of research, the approach has not always been service-oriented, whereby users are able to actually subscribe to the provisioning of this functionality. This is the new context introduced by IMS service continuity. There are, however, few reports on actual implementation and specific practical evaluations of IMS service continuity. In this work, we perform a testbed implementation and evaluation of IMS service continuity. Particularly, we investigate the signaling aspects of the service in a heterogeneous wireless networks environment. We develop a prototype service continuity application server, and use it with the UCT IMS Client and the FOKUS Open IMS Core to determine the effect of service continuity signaling on end user experience.	access network;application server;ip multimedia subsystem;performance evaluation;prototype;provisioning;scott continuity;seamless3d;server (computing);service-orientation;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;testbed;user experience	Keoikantse O.

However, FMIPv6 only concentrates on the protocol operation while it does not address other critical issues, such as the L2 and L3 identifiers mapping problem and precise L2 triggers generation. This paper proposes an efficient service-oriented framework for FMIPv6. In this framework, FMIPv6 is integrated with candidate access router discovery (CARD) mechanism, specified L2 triggers and different handover processes will be performed for different service types according to QoS requirements. The analytical and simulation results both show that the proposed scheme could achieve better performance in terms of handover latency.	fair queuing;global communications conference;ieee/acm transactions on networking;identifier;mobile ip;numerical analysis;real-time transcription;requirement;router (computing);service-oriented device architecture;simulation;subject matter expert turing test	Yun Zhou;Jun Yuan;Ying Wang;Ping Zhang	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.851	communications protocol;real-time computing;mobile qos;quality of service;computer science;computer security;mobile ip;computer network;general packet radio service	Mobile	-12.510337539032884	90.1816009029435	158381

Existing techniques, such as mobility or traffic models, are often either too simple to be representative for this purpose or too specific for a particular network structure. Desirable properties of a workload are reproducibility, representativeness, and scalability to any number of players. We analyze different mobility models and AI-based workload generators. Real gaming sessions with human players using the prototype game Planet PI4 serve as a reference workload. Novel metrics are used to measure the similarity between real and synthetic traces with respect to neighborhood characteristics. We found that, although more complicated to handle, AI players reproduce real workload characteristics more accurately than mobility models.	artificial intelligence;image scaling;planet hunters;prototype;requirement;scalability;synthetic intelligence;tracing (software);traffic analysis	Max Lehn;Tonio Triebel;Robert Rehner;Benjamin Guthier;Stephan Kopf;Alejandro P.

When combined with cloud computing this new way of serving media has the potential to change the video streaming landscape by allowing content to be streamed reliably from anywhere in the world. In this paper we evaluate the use of different TCP congestion control algorithms over the Cloud including five major variants: Cubic, Bic, Vegas, H-TCP, and HighSpeed TCP. Both private (based on Eucalyptus) and public (Amazon EC2) cloud environments are considered. We evaluate video streaming performance, TCP friendliness, and for each criterion identify the top performer. We believe that this is an important step towards optimizing TCP or another transport protocol for supporting cloud computing.	algorithm;amazon elastic compute cloud (ec2);cloud computing;cubic function;digital media player;linux;network congestion;streaming media;tcp congestion control	Rafael Alvarez-Horine;Melody Moh	2012	2012 IEEE Globecom Workshops	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477668	throughput;real time streaming protocol;real-time computing;media;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;tcp acceleration;bandwidth;server;computer network	Metrics	-8.838029205224505	97.71436719008769	158860

778dbbb38077ad32a0966c826d749afec7317c13	improving dash performance in a network with caching		Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) has been widely used in online video streaming nowadays. To reduce network congestion, popular videos are replicated in the intermediate cache nodes. However, with DASH, the intermediate cache node may lead to bitrate oscillations due to the difference in the throughputs from the end user to the cache node and from that to the origin server. In this paper, we develop an adaptation logic for DASH that can reduce bitrate oscillations. Our proposed adaptation logic combines both throughput-based and buffer-based adaptation methods. Extensive simulations show the efficiency of our proposed method.	archive;cache (computing);dynamic adaptive streaming over http;hypertext transfer protocol;network congestion;server (computing);simulation;streaming media;throughput;video clip	Tien-Dung Pham;Phuong Luu Vo;Truong Cong Thang	2017		10.1145/3155133.3155197	end user;throughput;cache;network congestion;computer network;dynamic adaptive streaming over http;dash;computer science	Metrics	-7.3322505014919654	98.1459661152669	159038

The special characteristics of these services lead us to developed a multiservice platform that easily brought mobility to applications and services not designed for that.This system was designed to work over SMS, allowing automation of the tedious work of programming reliable SMS-based interfaces. The new system automatically generates user front-ends for a wide variety of services based on forms. As we will see in the paper, the interfaces are defined by means of the novel W3C XForms standard.The resulting platform was designed to be highly efficient, reliable and fault tolerant. Choosing Erlang/OTP as the development environment was a key factor to acquire these goals.As part of the project an open source Erlang SMPP implementation was developed, key features of this library, named OSERL, are also described in this paper.	erlang (programming language);fault tolerance;open-source software;short message peer-to-peer;xforms toolkit	Enrique Marcote;Daniel I.

It is therefore very important to understand the association.  In this paper, by analyzing a number of wireless network traces, we verified the exponential distribution of the association of mobile users, which means that most mobile users are not closely associated. Furthermore, we examined the distribution of the inter-connectivity time of those mobile users more closely associated.	delay-tolerant networking;time complexity;tracing (software)	Pierrot Chery;Jiang Li;Legand L.

91eb83fde43596ad7bb327134435b996a099b39e	qos aware mpls multicast in the man diffserv domain		The continuous development of new Internet technologies and multimedia services tend to an ever greater interest in practical solutions of the multicast transmission. Simultaneously, service providers more and more pay attention on appropriate selection of mechanisms to guarantee the QoS parameters needed for the proper delivery of services sensitive to transmission parameters. From a practical point of view, the final solution for the QoS aware multicast transmission should be on the one hand, closely associated with existing standard networks mechanisms on the other hand, be sufficiently flexible to offer proper level of independence from specific technologies. These, for the first look, conflicting requirements can be solved by the packet labeling technique. This raises the question whether the current operator of the wide or metropolitan area network may implement multicast transmissions with a guarantee of the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters based on Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) technology. The answer to this question is the content of this article.	differentiated services;multicast;multiprotocol label switching;quality of service	Slawomir Przylucki	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02671-3_22	multicast;computer network	ECom	-7.064586783587443	95.36117951337582	159247

We have investigated the performances of those 3G networks in terms of their data throughput, latency, video and voice calls handling capacities, and their ability to provide service guarantees to different traffic classes under various loading conditions. Our findings indicate the diverse nature of network resources allocation and call admission control policies employed by different operators. It is also found that the 3G network operators seem to have extensively customized their network configurations in a cell-by-cell manner according to the individual site's local demographics, projected traffic demand and the target coverage area of the cell. As such, the cell capacity varies widely not only across different operators but also across different measurement sites of the same operator. Even for the same site, the capacity can easily change by more than 10% across multiple measurements taken at different time of the day. The results also show that it is practically impossible to predict the actual capacity of a cell based on known theoretical models and standard parameters, even when supplemented by key field measurements such as the received signal-to-noise ratio (Ec/N0).	algorithm;apache axis;cell (microprocessor);flow control (data);internet protocol suite;performance;rlc circuit;retransmission (data networks);signal-to-noise ratio;spatial variability;telecommunications link;terminate (software);throughput;unique key;visual intercept	Wee Lum Tan;Fung Lam;Wing Cheong Lau	2007	IEEE INFOCOM 2007 - 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFCOM.2007.178	real-time computing;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;queueing theory;empirical research;signal-to-noise ratio;scheduling;transport layer;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Metrics	-5.846050023143503	93.60928741603146	159480
51b827d88debbfa4aeda4a7423702e3357b2e03d	mechanisms for resilient video transmission		W ireless networks are envisaged to be one of the most important technologies to provide cost-efficient content delivery, including for video applications. They will allow thousands of thousands of fixed and mobile users to access, produce, share, and consume video content in an ubiquitous way. Real-time video services over these networks are becoming a part of everyday life and have been used to spread information ranging from education to entertainment content. However, the challenge of dealing with the fluctuating bandwidth, scarce resources, and time-varying error rate of these networks, highlights the need for error-resilient video transmission. In this context, the combination of Forward Error Correction (FEC) and Unequal Error Protection (UEP) approaches is known to provide the distribution of video applications for wireless users with Quality of Experience (QoE) assurance. In order to correctly perform the UEP it is necessary to identify the most important parts in the video sequences. To tackle this issue, this thesis proposed a procedure to assess the video characteristics, such as the codec type, the frame type and size, the length and format of the group of pictures as well as the motion vectors, and their related impact on the perceived quality to end-users. Furthermore, as the video content plays an important role on the perceived quality, this thesis also proposes a method to characterise the video’s motion intensity. This involves conducting an exploratory data analysis in bootstrap time and then the use of several techniques in real-time to use the found results. The purpose of the above-mentioned proposals is to give support for the main goal of this thesis, which is to propose mechanisms for resilient video transmission. Taking everything into consideration, this thesis proposes a series of cross-layer video-aware and FEC-based mechanisms with UEP to enhance video transmission in several types of wireless networks. A number of methods to set an adaptive amount of redundancy were used in these mechanisms, such as heuristic techniques, random neural networks, ant colony optimisation, and fuzzy logic. In the first one, heuristic techniques, the mechanisms rely on human experience to define the best strategy. In addition, the aim is not to reach a perfect solution, but a practical one with satisfactory results. In the random neural networks methods, the neurones are trained and validated before run-time until they are able to perform an adequate numeric categorisation. The ant colony optimisation techniques use a defined metaheuristic based on the ant’s pheromones and pre-set rules to compute a precise amount of redundancy. The last one, fuzzy logic techniques, the mechanisms depend on fuzzy rules and sets to find an adequate redundancy ratio. The advantages and drawbacks of the proposed mechanisms were demonstrated in realistic simulations using real video sequences and actual network traces. The assessments were conducted with well-known QoE metrics. The results show that all the proposed mechanisms were able to outperform the competitors on both perceived video quality and network footprint.	ant colony optimization algorithms;artificial neural network;bit error rate;categorization;codec;cost efficiency;digital distribution;digital video;forward error correction;fuzzy logic;group of pictures;heuristic;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;qr code;random neural network;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;simulation;software metric;tracing (software)	Roger Immich;Eduardo Cerqueira;Marília Curado	2018	CoRR		computer network;distributed computing;computer science	Metrics	-8.779645839023528	100.18181036870784	159627

In this paper, we consider a P2P streaming network where a server generates content chunks, and transmits each chunk to a randomly selected peer. Peers then exchange chunks among themselves according to some chunk selection policy. While the performance of different chunk selection policies has been intensively analyzed assuming no peer arrival or departure, the impact of peer churn on P2P live streaming has not been well understood yet. We show that unlike in the static network scenario, larger buffer size does not necessarily result in higher playout probability in the presence of peer churn. We further analyze the relation between the buffer size, playout probability and peer churn under different chunk selection policies and characterize the impact of peer churn on the performance of these chunk selection policies via both theoretical analysis and simulations.	peer-to-peer;playout;randomness;server (computing);simulation;streaming media	Xiaohan Kang;Juan José Jaramillo;Lei Ying	2012	2012 50th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/Allerton.2012.6483384	computer science;internet privacy;dead peer detection;world wide web;computer network	Metrics	-9.328015337506612	96.77815226359041	159646

For Internet service providers (ISPs), the increased investment cost required to maintain stable quality for delivering rich content is a serious problem, and ISPs need to recover this cost from CPs because it is difficult to do so by increasing fees to users. However, CPs usually pay a transit fee in which the increase ratio diminishes as the volume of transmitted data increases, so the revenue collected by the ISPs is not sufficient to cover their investment cost. To address this problem, a content charge in which ISPs charge a fee for each content delivery to CPs would seem to be effective. However, it is anticipated that CPs will switch to another ISP if an ISP introduces a content charge, so introducing a content charge may not always increase the revenue of ISPs. Assuming a competitive environment of two ISPs in which one ISP introduces a content charge and each ISP can freely set its charging parameter, this paper models the relationship among CPs and two ISPs using a three-stage Stackelberg game and investigates the effect of a content charge by ISPs on the revenue of each player.	digital distribution;download;elegant degradation;internet;numerical analysis;unity	Noriaki Kamiyama	2014	2014 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS)	10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838248	games;simulation;investment;computer science;computer security;computer network	Networks	-15.775177624462579	99.04306919921785	160374
e9d57fc172a3630031acba7374390cedc8d49e1a	future internet services: tiered or neutral		Novel Internet applications not only demand more capacity, but also their prevalent request for near-to-real-time transmission requires to increasingly provision high levels of delivered quality of service (QoS). Bandwidth and end-to-end delay of connections across the Internet vary by several orders of magnitude, therefore unequal data handling per node is commonly applied to achieve differentiated QoS. This practice contradicts Internet neutrality if it is not restricted to pure application awareness. A strict separation of network operation from service provisioning would perfectly fit to achieve Internet neutrality. But this may lack economic business models for network operators, especially in a flat-rate world. Differentiated charging offers a solution to achieve fair, autonomous, and cost-related revenue distribution among stakeholders.	future internet;web service	Brikena Statovci-Halimi;Gerald Franzl	2011	Elektrotechnik und Informationstechnik	10.1007/s00502-011-0047-z	telecommunications;internet transit;computer security;computer network	OS	-8.167594068416808	94.28483859074834	160436

In the proposed system, new customers will be grouped together by the local server with the DR batching scheme and then be served by the multicast backbone network. Two scheduling policies are developed to serve customers at the local batching servers. The results show that the hierarchical VoD system can greatly reduce the resources requirement compared with the centralized approach. In addition, in order to secure the multicast channels for the new multicast groups, the backbone channel reservation algorithm that is similar to the look-ahead scheme [Multimedia Systems 3 (1995) 137] is proposed. If there are 100 videos and 500 backbone multicast channels, the system is able to support 0.2 requests/s with less than 7% admission blocking probability. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In order to achieve this, a number of technical issues must be resolved in a satisfactory manner, including the required extensions of the discovery process, currently specified in Clause 64 of IEEE 802.3-2008.

One of the arguments we focused on is the possibility of deploying a set of services in areas lacking of low-cost and wide band connectivity to Internet, as rural or mountain communities. The main idea is that it is possible to transfer data by mobile vehicles such as bus, letter carriers and other similar means, by equipping them with an ad hoc kit able to discover clients capable to receive news, e-mail or, generally, to act as a server for other kind of services. In this context we used AODV protocol to interconnect the hosts involved in the test-bed and SLP to develop some applications to offer e-mail and news pushing services over discontinuous connectivity.	email;hoc (programming language);internet;server (computing);superword level parallelism;testbed	Stefano Annese;Andrea Ghittino	2005	First International Conference on Testbeds and Research Infrastructures for the DEvelopment of NeTworks and COMmunities	10.1109/TRIDNT.2005.40	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;the internet;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;dynamic circuit network;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;delay-tolerant networking;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing;internet privacy;routing protocol;mobile computing;computer network;broadband networks;testbed	Mobile	-18.728740393327453	91.12197798969633	162046

Several efforts have argued that accurate throughput prediction can dramatically improve (1) initial bitrate selection for low startup delay and high initial resolution; (2) midstream bitrate adaptation for high QoE. However, prior ef- forts did not systematically quantify real-world throughput predictability or develop good prediction algorithms. To bridge this gap, this paper makes three key technical contributions: First, we analyze the throughput characteristics in a dataset with 20M+ sessions. We find: (a) Sessions sharing similar key features (e.g., ISP, region) present similar initial values and dynamical patterns; (b) There is a natural “stateful” dynamical behavior within a given session. Second, building on these insights, we develop CS2P, a better throughput prediction system. CS2P leverages data-driven approach to learn (a) clusters of similar sessions, (b) an initial throughput predictor, and (c) a Hidden-Markov-Model based midstream predictor modeling the stateful evolution of throughput. Third, we develop a prototype system and show by trace-driven simulation and real-world experiments that CS2P outperforms state-of-art by 40% and 50% median pre- diction error respectively for initial and midstream through- put and improves QoE by 14% over buffer-based adaptation algorithm.	algorithm;dynamical system;emoticon;experiment;hidden markov model;kerrison predictor;markov chain;prototype;simulation;state (computer science);throughput	Yi Sun;Xiaoqi Yin;Junchen Jiang;Vyas Sekar;Fuyuan Lin;Nanshu Wang;Tao Liu;Bruno Sinopoli	2016		10.1145/2934872.2934898	throughput;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;transmission control protocol;variable bitrate;constant bitrate;computer network	Networks	-8.429525571617306	98.23838155677146	162197

A majority of the existing CC algorithms are implemented at the transport layer, mostly coupled with TCP. Over the past three decades, CC algorithms have incrementally evolved, resulting in many extensions of TCP. A thorough evaluation of a new TCP extension is a huge task. Hence, the Internet Congestion Control Research Group (ICCRG) has proposed a common TCP evaluation suite that helps researchers to gain an initial insight into the working of their proposed TCP extension.  This paper presents an implementation of the TCP evaluation suite in ns-3, that automates the simulation setup, topology creation, traffic generation, execution, and results collection.

Given their heterogeneity, to assess DTN performance in challenged networks is challenging in and of itself. For this reason, it is essential to develop suitable evaluation tools, with very flexible use. In this demo we present the third major release of DTNperf, a client-server evaluation tool designed to assess goodput and to provide status report logs in DTN Bundle Protocol (BP) architectures. In this third version DTNperf has been greatly enhanced in many respects, including full support of both DTN2 and ION (the BP reference implementation and that developed by NASA JPL, respectively). The demo wants to present both new and enhanced features in a variety of application examples, derived in part from the authors' experience on satellite and space communications. The final aim is to promote its use within the DTN community and receive suggestions from researchers. DTNperf_3 is free software and thanks to its double support is to be included not only in DTN2, as were previous versions, but also in ION."""	client–server model;delay-tolerant networking;denial-of-service attack;goodput;interoperability;reference implementation;server (computing)	Carlo Caini;Anna D'Amico;Michele Rodolfi	2013		10.1145/2505494.2505508	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;delay-tolerant networking;computer security;communications satellite;computer network	HCI	-6.01477623857142	91.64523314698711	162296

Previous studies have shown that video traffic exhibits long-range dependence (LRD) (Hurst parameter large than 0.5). We investigate the practical implications of LRD in the context of realistic ATM traffic engineering by studying ATM multiplexers of VBR video sources over a range of desirable cell loss rates and buffer sizes (maximum delays). Using results based on large deviations theory, we introduce the notion of Critical Time Scale (CTS). For a given buffer size, link capacity, and the marginal distribution of frame size, the CTS of a VBR video source is defined as the number of frame correlations that contribute to the cell loss rate. In other words, second-order behavior at the time scale beyond the CTS does not significantly affect the network performance. We show that whether the video source model is Markov or has LRD, its CTS is finite, attains a small value for small buffer, and is a non-decreasing function of buffer size. Numerical results show that (i) even in the presence of LRD, long-term correlations do not have significant impact on the cell loss rate; and (ii) short-term correlations have dominant effect on cell loss rate, and therefore, well-designed Markov traffic models are effective for predicting Quality of Service (QOS) of LRD VBR video traffic. Therefore, we conclude that it is unnecessary to capture the long-term correlations of a real-time VBR video source under realistic ATM buffer dimensioning scenarios as far as the cell loss rates and maximum buffer delays are concerned.	atm turbo;carpal tunnel syndrome;hurst exponent;marginal model;markov chain;multiplexer;network performance;numerical linear algebra;open-source software;quality of service;real-time clock;volume boot record	Bong K.

A DASH server hosts multiple representations of the same video, each of which is broken down into small segments of fixed playback duration. The video bitrate adaptation is purely driven by the player at the endhost. Typically, the player employs an Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithm, that determines the most appropriate representation for the next segment to be downloaded, based on the current network conditions and user preferences. The aim of an ABR algorithm is to dynamically manage the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the user during the playback. ABR algorithms manage the QoE by maximizing the bitrate while at the same time trying to minimize the other QoE metrics: playback start time, duration and number of buffering events, and the number of bitrate switching events. Typically, the ABR algorithms manage the QoE by using the measured network throughput and buffer occupancy to adapt the playback bitrate. However, due to the video encoding schemes employed, the sizes of the individual segments may vary significantly. For low bandwidth networks, fluctuation in the segment sizes results in inaccurate estimation the expected segment fetch times, thereby resulting in inaccurate estimation of the optimum bitrate. In this paper we demonstrate how the Segment-Aware Rate Adaptation (SARA) algorithm, that considers the measured throughput, buffer occupancy, and the variation in segment sizes helps in better management of the users' QoE in a DASH system. By comparing with a typical throughput-based and buffer-based adaptation algorithm under varying network conditions, we demonstrate that SARA manages the QoE better, especially in a low bandwidth network. We also developed AStream, an open-source Python-based emulated DASH-video player that was used to evaluate three different ABR algorithms and measure the QoE metrics with each of them.	algorithm;data compression;dynamic adaptive streaming over http;emulator;hypertext transfer protocol;open-source software;python;quantum fluctuation;server (computing);throughput;user (computing)	Parikshit Juluri;Venkatesh Tamarapalli;Deep Medhi	2016	NOMS 2016 - 2016 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium	10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502805	throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;operating system;variable bitrate;constant bitrate;bandwidth;server;computer network	Networks	-7.549545391188826	98.8251037057326	162422

As mobile devices are growing and networks are becoming heterogeneous, their mobility management in heterogeneous mobile networks has become important. Nonetheless, previous network simulators have focused on handover protocols at layer 2 or layer 3, but have not focused on handover decisions at layer 7. This tool suite allows the user to create multiple types of mobile networks, mobile nodes, and network servers for testing mobility of mobile devices. Moreover, it also allows the user to create simulation scenarios and generates testing results based on users’ demands. This paper presents the requirements, design, and implementation of the tool suite. We show the feasibility of our tool using a case study of contextaware handover decision management.	mobile device;requirement;server (computing);simulation	Joon-Myung Kang;Sin-Seok Seo;John Strassner;James Won-Ki Hong	2011			embedded system;mobile search;simulation;mobile web;mobile technology;mobility model;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	-14.418990870259565	89.5092529585257	162771

In virtue of providing various types of multimedia services among different kinds of access networks, IMS is considered as the core network for future Next Generation Networks. For detecting the requested services quickly and efficiently, it is necessary for IMS to adopt a valid Service Discovery function. In this paper, we propose an optimal model of Service Discovery Architecture based on IMS to support a universal Service Discovery function independent of any specific network access technology. The optimal model analyses are studied by mathematical modeling, theoretical analyses, and numerical simulations.	access network;assistive technology;ip multimedia subsystem;mathematical model;next-generation network;numerical analysis;sensor;service discovery	Jie Zhang	2008	2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists	10.1109/ICYCS.2008.284	real-time computing;next-generation network;computer science;operating system;service discovery;mobile computing;world wide web;ip multimedia subsystem;computer security;computer network	HPC	-14.979561336510503	91.83857581285686	162783

The results show that if a critical mass of terminal agents exchange experienced QoS information, the overall network selection decision is improved: terminal agents can estimate, on beforehand, which type of performances to expect with different candidate networks, and avoid to select those not satisfying service requirements. This, in turn brings two main positive effects: on one hand, user perceived performance is improved, and, on the other hand, the adoption of RRM strategies providing some degree QoS is incentivated"""	best-effort delivery;centralized computing;entity;interoperability;peer-to-peer;perceived performance;quality of service;radio resource management;requirement;self-organized criticality;user experience	Pietro Lungaro	2006	2006 IEEE 63rd Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2006.1682927	local area network;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;operating system;world wide web;computer security;computer network	HPC	-8.681911392142268	94.28538811961437	162860

The 60GHz frequency band has been adopted to support high data rate applications in wireless personal area networks (WPANs). In the IEEE 802.15.3c standard for millimeter-wave-based high-rate WPANs, devices are allocated a dedicated transmission time called a CTA (channel time allocation) based on their request to transmit. While the duration of a CTA may be adjusted, the standard does not specify how resource allocation should be achieved. High-Definition (HD) video with variable bit rate (VBR) is a potential application for the WPAN. In this work, an IEEE 802.15.3c network is simulated and the throughput losses due to static resource provisioning for a series of H.264/SVC (MPEG-4 Part 10) HD video sources are identified. It is demonstrated that the high data rates proposed for the 60GHz frequency band will not be achieved without dynamic resource allocation.	dynamical system;frequency band;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;matlab;network packet;overhead (computing);provisioning;quality of service;requirement;simulation;throughput;uncompressed video;volume boot record	Sandra Scott-Hayward;Emi Garcia-Palacios	2011	2011 IEEE 36th Conference on Local Computer Networks	10.1109/LCN.2011.6115576	network allocation vector;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;wireless network;ieee 802.11h-2003;extremely high frequency;variable bitrate;bandwidth;computer network;time allocation	Visualization	-5.6725301996341555	100.32268269877815	163217

Unlike most existing slicing methods where each slice includes nearly equal number of video macroblocks, the proposed scheme reorders the macroblocks in one video frame according to their importance, and then divides them into two slices with an unequal proportion. According to given channel conditions and a novel unequal loss protection scheme, the more appropriate macroblock division ratio can be found out to achieve minimized end-to-end distortion. Simulation results show that the proposed slicing scheme outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with fixed macroblock division ratio.	data compression;digital video;distortion;end-to-end principle;macroblock;network packet;peak signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Chongyang Zhang;Hua Yang;Wei Zhang;Shibao Zheng	2009	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2009.2025832	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;packet switching;statistics;computer network	Mobile	-5.789089371224424	100.84156086885764	163424

It is becoming essential for Web servers to provide performance isolation, have fast recovery times, and provide continuous service during overload at least to preferred customers. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a kernel-based architecture that protects Web servers against overload by controlling the amount and rate of work entering the system. We present three mechanisms that provide admission control and service differentiation based on connection and application level information. Our basic admission control mechanism, TCP SYN policing, limits the acceptance rate of new requests based on the connection attributes. The second mechanism,prioritized listen queue, supports different service classes by reordering the listen queue of a server socket based on the priorities of the incoming connection requests. Third, we present URL-based connection control that uses application-level information such as URLs and cookies to define priorities and rate control policies. We have implemented these mechanisms in AIX 5.0. Through numerous experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of these mechanisms in achieving the desired degree of service differentiation during overload. We also show that the kernel mechanisms are more efficient and scalable than application level controls implemented in the Web server.	aix;application programming interface;denial-of-service attack;differentiated service;dynamic web page;e-commerce;experiment;firewall (computing);http cookie;network socket;overhead (computing);production system (computer science);syn flood;scalability;server (computing);system administrator;throughput;token bucket;web server;world wide web	Thiemo Voigt;Renu Tewari;Douglas Freimuth;Ashish Mehra	2001			e-commerce;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;computer network	Networks	-8.125213561834371	92.92522591340975	163539

Unlike host-based mobility management, the network handles mobility signaling on behalf of mobile nodes in Proxy Mobile IPv6, i.e., the mobile nodes are not involved in mobility management, hence have no control on handover-related signaling. The current specification of Proxy Mobile IPv6 defines basic operations for registration, deregistration, and tunnel management. As mobile nodes have no control on mobility management, the timing for handover signaling is not synchronized with the mobile node’s ability to send and receive packets on the handover target link. This turns out to be an issue for mobile nodes being equipped with multiple network interfaces and performing handover between these access technologies (inter-technology handover), as the configuration of the target network interface and the associated link takes time. In this work, we investigate technical issues that occur during an inter-technology handover in Proxy Mobile IPv6. We demonstrate through experimental performance evaluation that an inter-technology handover in Proxy Mobile IPv6 can cause considerable handover delay and packet loss. We propose an efficient extension to Proxy Mobile IPv6 to eliminate delay and packet loss during an inter-technology handover. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed extension through an experimental performance evaluation.	auto-configuration;mobile ip;network interface;network packet;performance evaluation;proxy mobile ipv6;race condition;seamless3d	Long Le;Marco Liebsch	2009	2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917918	telecommunications;computer science;network interface;mobility model;mobile computing;computer security;soft handover;computer network	Mobile	-11.242648462067633	89.62628192589716	164115

In this paper, we consider a duopoly market consisting of two access ISPs and formulate a noncooperative game over their choices of pricing strategies when one of them uses volume-based and the other congestion-based pricing. We prove, under mild conditions, the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for the competing providers. We further examine how the different types of transit charges affect the pricing strategies of the access ISPs. We find cases where the volume charging ISP is forced to leave the access market. We conclude that ISPs have economic incentives to adopt congestion accountability mechanisms, since they become more competitive due to the smoother and more predictable traffic they have to accommodate and to the lower transit charges they incur.	explicit congestion notification;internet protocol suite;nash equilibrium;network congestion	Alexandros Kostopoulos;Antonis Dimakis;Costas A.

However, in the current stage of IPv6 deployment, the newly IPv6-enabled device [i.e. typically internet protocol version 4 (IPv4)/IPv6 dual-stack device] may connect to an existing IPv4 device. In the traditional ‘server-based solutions’, the SIP server is modified to perform the IPv4–IPv6 translations to the SIP messages and the real-time transport protocol (RTP) packets. However, the IPv4–IPv6 translations increase the call setup latency, the RTP transmission delay and the packet loss possibility. To reduce the drawbacks, this study proposes a ‘client-based solution’, where the client (i.e. the end device) instead of the SIP server performs the IPv4–IPv6 translation. The authors utilise the message flows to elaborate three server based and the proposed client-based solutions. In addition, the authors implement all solutions and deploy them in an IPv4–IPv6 interworking testbed. By using the testbed, the authors analyse these solutions in terms of the ‘UA modification, the SIP Server modification, the call setup complexity and the RTP translation’.	next-generation network	Whai-En Chen;Ssu-Hsien Li	2013	IET Networks	10.1049/iet-net.2012.0084	sip trunking;stateless protocol;rtp control protocol;computer science;distributed computing;internet protocol suite;world wide web;computer network	Theory	-14.176203656625027	92.9980521098559	164283

We prove that an incentive mechanism can be created for a live streaming P2P protocol while preserving the asymptotic properties of randomized gossip-based streaming. In order to show the utility of our result, we adapt a distributed incentive scheme from P2P file storage literature to the live streaming scenario. We provide simulation results that confirm the ability to achieve a constant download rate (in time, per peer) that is needed for streaming applications on peers. The incentive scheme fairly differentiates peers’ download rates according to the amount of useful bandwidth they contribute back to the P2P system, thus creating a powerful quality-of-service incentive for peers to contribute bandwidth to other peers. We propose a functional architecture and protocol format for a gossip-based streaming system with incentive mechanisms, and present evaluation data from a real implementation of a P2P streaming application.	centralized computing;database;digital video;download;fairness measure;gossip protocol;megabyte;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;proportionally fair;quality of service;randomized algorithm;simulation;streaming media;testbed;throughput	Sachin Agarwal;Jatinder Pal Singh;Shruti Dube	2007	Adv. in MM	10.1155/2007/84150	computer science;peer-to-peer;database;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer network	Metrics	-9.006913910344535	97.07333594382796	164423

To this aim service providers must devise a strategy to monitor the perceived quality and automatically adapt it when necessary. Measuring perceived quality is challenging for service providers. So there is the need for a mapping model to predict perceived video quality from system related quality of service parameters. In this article performance comparison of widely used quality of service to quality of experience mapping models has been presented and optimal solution has been recommended for key quality of service parameters: jitter, delay, packet loss rate and throughput limitation. For this purpose the freely available video quality database ReTRiEVED has been used.	cognitive dimensions of notations;color;digital video;network packet;public lending right;quality of service;throughput	Federica Battisti;Marco Carli;Pradip Paudyal	2014	2014 Euro Med Telco Conference (EMTC)	10.1109/EMTC.2014.6996648	subjective video quality;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;video quality;multimedia;pevq;computer network	Networks	-9.350045231655187	100.45886071323122	164549

In this period of migration from the legacy networks to the NGN, every regulator has adopted an approach different from other depending upon the regulatory environment in which they operate and the future plans of the market player. Fundamentally, the NGNs decouple the functionality between network and the services to be offered on these networks. This decoupling brings different types of business models with respect to the degree of integration of transport, control and service provision. In the presence of these business models the continuity of perfect competition and economic growth is a challenging task for the NRAs. In this paper we will elaborate the regulatory challenges posed by network evolution, some current regulatory options, role of the geographic markets in the regulatory framework and then will conclude that “All-in-one” regulatory approach is not suitable for the regulation of NGN, particularly during this transition period.

cbfba0870144cc0114cf4c82feb966f1f2258026	qdlcoding: qos-differentiated low-cost video encoding scheme for online video service		Adaptive bitrate (ABR) streaming is the de facto solution in online video services to cope with heterogeneous devices and varying network connections. However, this solution is computation intensive, demanding a large number of servers for encoding videos. Moreover, due to the time-varying nature of video generation, intelligent strategies are required in order to determine the right amount of resources for encoding. The situation is further complicated by the fact that, the two types of co-existing video content, live content and Video-on-Demand (VoD) content, have different QoS requirements for encoding. These observations posit daunting challenges for meeting the heterogeneous QoS requirements with a minimum computing capacity. This paper proposes the QoS-differentiated low-cost video encoding (QDLCoding) scheme to address these challenges. We develop a framework for scheduling the encoding workloads of the two types of videos with statistical QoS guarantees. Each type of videos is specified with a QoS criterion and a QoS loss bound. The objective is to provision the minimum amount of resources while keeping the QoS loss probabilities within the prescribed bounds. We design an online algorithm that can determine the minimum required capacity by learning content arrival distributions. The experiment results demonstrate that our method can greatly reduce the required capacity for encoding online videos while controlling the likelihood of QoS loss precisely.	computation;data compression;digital video;dynamic priority scheduling;image scaling;line code;online algorithm;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);server (computing);streaming media;video clip	Guanyu Gao;Yonggang Wen;Han Hu	2017	IEEE INFOCOM 2017 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057024	quality of service;online algorithm;computer network;capacity planning;resource management;computation;real-time computing;distributed computing;scheduling (computing);computer science;encoding (memory);server	Embedded	-6.099903042419154	99.47383125477587	165720

Three main aspects must be considered to obtain seamless continuity: an enabling interworking architecture, fast inter-system handovers (they must be fast enough in terms of human senses), and, in the case of real-time services, a similar quality of service (QoS) in both networks. This paper focuses on the two first issues. It presents an interworking architecture based on a 3G core-level integration of the WLANs. The GPRS network is available all the time forming a primary network, and WLANs are used as a complement when they are available. The switching times between networks are very low and the transitions are lossless. Our proposal does not disrupt with the current 3GPP standardization efforts making it viable in a medium time frame. This paper presents an overview of the architecture, describes the relevant events in the switching process (where the authentication and authorization procedures have an important role), and gives simulated values for the switching times.	authentication;authorization;lossless compression;quality of service;real-time clock;scott continuity;seamless3d	Paulo Pinto;Luís Bernardo;Pedro Sobral	2006	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2005.06.002	telecommunications;computer science;authentication;computer security;computer network	Networks	-13.949221135419394	96.08160461730725	165781

For a fixed channel bit rate and finite number of channel coding rate, the proposed scheme can find the optimal source and channel coding pair and corresponding robust video coding scheme such that the expected end-to-end distortion of video signals can be minimized. With the assumption that encoder has the stochastic channel information, the proposed scheme takes into account robust video coding, channel coding and packetization, error concealment techniques altogether. Simulation results show the accuracy and optimality of the proposed method.	channel capacity;data compression;distortion;encoder;end-to-end encryption;error concealment;forward error correction;simulation	Jie Song;K.

This OMR strategy employs the channel reservation control packets at the MAC layer to exchange timely Channel Quality Estimation (CQE) information for an adaptive adjustment of spectrally efficient transmission rate at the physical layer. Such rate adaptation scheme offers an optimized transmission to guarantee the minimum packets delay and drop rate needed for time bound applications, such as video. Since IEEE 802.11 standard does not adopt a multi-rate MAC to support time critical applications, we need to resolve the problem associated with IEEE 802.11 standard by designing a novel adaptive rate architecture with minor modification on IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol based on CQE. This integrated scheme allows the physical layer to achieve the optimal transmission via smart FEC scheme implemented in the application layer. We evaluate the proposed scheme based on network-level metrics, including bit rate, packets delay and drop rate, in comparison with the state-of-the-art Opportunistic Auto-Rate (OAR) MAC scheme based on IEEE 802.11 WMNs. Extensive simulation results based on H.264/AVC video transmission for both proposed OMR scheme and OAR MAC have confirmed that the proposed OMR strategy outperforms the OAR MAC by a significant margin as CQE and smart FEC is able to adapt to the dynamic network conditions of IEEE 802.11 WMNs in a timely fashion.	forward error correction;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;mesh networking;opensimulator;optical mark recognition;simulation;streaming media;wireless mesh network	Byung Joon Oh;Chang Wen Chen	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117987	ieee 802.11s;wireless mesh network;wireless ad hoc network;network allocation vector;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;physical layer;wireless;spectral efficiency;computer network	Embedded	-5.9587134629920495	101.60459008843154	166140

The increased network traffic and the absence of service priority, usually produce high network congestions, delayed data and service transmissions and lack of throughput. The effect of these factors in AW content transmission is to distort the initial content and decrease the content quality. To avoid this negative effect, service and content providers are looking for architectures that give them greater control on traffic passing through their domains and other heterogeneous networks. This document proposes an experimental core network architecture (MPLS-DiffServ) presenting a solution for content providers that want reliable and agreed level of quality, even if the network is under congestion. MPLS-DiffServ architecture, couples the DiffServ'sper hop guarantees with MPLS traffic engineering capabilities. Furthermore, content/services of different format will be distributed over MPLS-DiffServ network with different guarantee limits and delivered on a variety of user terminals..	adjusted winner procedure;differentiated services;digital distribution;distortion;internet;multiprotocol label switching;network architecture;network congestion;network traffic control;quality of service;throughput	Nikos Zotos;Georgios Xilouris;Evangelos Pallis;Anastasios Kourtis	2008	2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications	10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493658	multi-frequency network;multiprotocol label switching;best-effort delivery;network traffic control;the internet;core network;heterogeneous network;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;customer service assurance;network congestion;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-7.756931060091781	94.2983265098671	166235

E-mail address: a.passarella@iit.cnr.it One of the most striking properties of the Internet is its flexibility to accommodate features it was not conceived for. Among the most significant examples, in this survey we consider the transition of the Internet from a reliable fault-tolerant network for host-to-host communication to a content-centric network, i.e. a network mostly devoted to support efficient generation, sharing and access to content. We survey this research area according to a top-down approach. We present a conceptual framework that encompasses the key building blocks required to support content-centric networking in the Internet. Then we describe in detail the two most important types of content-centric Internet technologies, i.e., Content-Delivery Networks (CDNs) and P2P systems. For each of them, we show how they cover the key building blocks. We then identify the functional components of CDN and P2P content management solutions, and discuss the main solutions proposed in the literature for each of them. We consider different types of content (both real time and non real time), and different networking environments (fixed, mobile, . . .). Finally, we also discuss the main recent research trends focused on how to design the Future Internet as a native content-centric network. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Universal mobile channels are capable of supporting distinct adaptive quality of service control and mobility management services over the same cellular access network infrastructure. Built on a splitlevel adaptation control scheme that operates at the application and network levels, universal mobile channels o er a set of well de ned open programmable interfaces to actively exploit the intrinsic scalability of adaptive mobile applications in cellular IP networks. Universal mobile channels are fully programmable and expose interfaces that include: (i) utility curves, which capture the adaptive nature of mobile applications in terms of the range of bandwidth over which they can successfully operate; (ii) adaptation policy, which enables adaptive mobile applications to program per-session adaptation time-scales and bandwidth granularities realizing novel application-speci c adaptive services; and (iii) session policy, which enables users to specify the relative importance of ows/sessions within the same universal mobile channel.

Safe and efficient teleremote operation requires good-quality video feedback. Varying radio conditionsmake it desirable to adapt the video sending rate of cameras tomake the best use of the wireless capacity. The adaptation should be able to prioritize camera feeds in different directions depending on motion, ongoing tasks, and safety concerns. Self-Clocked Rate Adaptation for Multimedia (SCReAM) provides a rate adaptation algorithm for these needs. SCReAM can control the compression used for multiple video streams using differentiating priorities and thereby provide sufficient congestion control to achieve both low latency and high video throughput. We present results from the testing of prioritized adaptation of four video streams with SCReAM over LTE and discuss how such adaptation can be useful for the teleremote operation of working machines.	algorithm;clock rate;compaq lte;intra-frame coding;network congestion;network packet;streaming media;throughput	Ingemar Johansson;Siddharth Dadhich;Ulf Bodin;Tomas Jönsson	2018	Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing	10.1155/2018/3142496	remote operation;computer science;computer network;streams;automation;throughput;latency (engineering);wireless;network congestion;video feedback	Mobile	-6.651009810782461	99.60876917209002	166447

Typically, the sending rate at the server is faster than the playback rate at the handheld device. Therefore, it can't receive streaming video as possible as the sending rate even if there is no congestion and extremely low BER over wireless. Our objective is to develop a simple cost effective rate control scheme using a buffer level at a mobile device. We classify the buffer at a mobile device into three distinct states depending on its level (occupancy). For each of these states a different rate control is to be applied.

The scenario considered in this paper is that of a group of customers located into a same public vehicle, e.g. a moving train connected to the network via a satellite link, and requesting either video-on-demand-like services, as well as real-time diffusive (broadcast) streaming services. We show that a proxy server, devised to introduce an elastic buffer aimed at decoupling the information retrieval download speed on the outer network from the natural play-out speed used in the vehicular network, results to be an extremely effective approach in reducing the outage probability given by link failure in the outer network (e.g. tunnel crossing). A resource management mechanism, called A2M, is applied to both video-on-demand and diffusive services, and its performance effectiveness is evaluated through simulation.	algorithm;coupling (computer programming);download;downtime;information retrieval;proxy server;real-time clock;resource management (computing);scalability;server (computing);simulation;variable-length buffer	Vincenzo Mancuso;Marco Gambardella;Giuseppe Bianchi	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Communications (IEEE Cat.

The platform is designed with two xPc targets which communicate with each other over the Internet. A novel contribution of the platform is that it allows for the realistic and yet, low-cost simulations of bilateral control topologies under real word Internet delay, without the need for the actual manipulators or related hardware. A small case study is also presented to test the performance of the platform.	algorithm;bilateral filter;computer simulation;control system;deployment environment;simulation	Ahmet Kuzu;Seta Bogosyan;Metin Gokasan	2012	2012 12th IEEE International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control (AMC)	10.1109/AMC.2012.6197132	communications protocol;real-time computing;the internet;simulation;control system;open platform;open platform management architecture;solid modeling;network delay	Robotics	-14.521831794623347	93.57873205070234	166654

However, most of these algorithms cannot detect anomalies that occur beyond enterprise boundaries. Anomaly monitoring and detection on end-to-end Internet paths, although important for network operations, is challenging due to lack of access and control over intermediate network devices. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that detects anomalies or significant events on an end-to-end Internet path by monitoring the path's available bandwidth. We first evaluate existing algorithms on a comprehensive dataset of more than a million bandwidth measurements spanning three years. We show that existing algorithms do not incorporate the typical behavior of a path in the anomaly detection process and consequently incur accuracy degradations. We therefore propose to filter noisy bandwidth measurements to extract a typical or baseline statistical distribution of a path's bandwidth. This baseline model is in turn leveraged in a generic decision-theoretic framework to provide timely detection of significant path events. We show that the proposed detector provides highly accurate performance and easily surpasses the accuracy of existing techniques.	algorithm;anomaly detection;bandwidth (signal processing);baseline (configuration management);decision theory;digital television adapter;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;file spanning;open-source software;rrdtool;sensor	Fida Gillani;Umar Kalim;Noman Latif;Syed Ali Khayam	2011	2011 4th Symposium on Configuration Analytics and Automation (SAFECONFIG)	10.1109/SafeConfig.2011.6111680	computer science;data mining;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-6.055594481087721	90.36490806005119	166897

In particular since UMTS operators are searching for new applications which do both: a) exploit the potential of the UMTS technology and b) motivate the user to adopt the new technology. In this work we are investigating the performance of an eDonkey-based mobile P2P file-sharing system by means of time-dynamic simulation. Mobile networks differ from wireline networks by the limited capacity of the radio link and the mobility of the users. P2P networks, in contrast, are overlays which consider the transport network in an abstract way. In a mobile environment, the question arises, whether the abstraction can be maintained and what will be the performance impact if there is any. We will show in detail how the mobile access technology (GPRS or UMTS), the churn behavior of mobile users, the file size of mobile specific content, and special infrastructure entities, such as a cache peer, influences the performance of the suggested mobile P2P file-sharing service.	assistive technology;edonkey network;emoticon;entity;killer application;peer-to-peer file sharing;performance evaluation;serial experiments lain;simulation	Kurt Tutschku;Tobias Hoßfeld;Hermann de Meer;Jens O.

The client player implementations from different popular commercial services make different parameter and architectural choices, which result from heterogeneous APIs and device limitations. As a result, they exhibit quite different behaviors even for the same service, with very different traffic consumption characteristics.  In this paper, we examine three major streaming services -- Netflix, Youtube, and Hulu, over the two dominant mobile platforms -- iOS and Android, in order to understand the impact of these design choices. We infer detailed session behavior based on passively collected packet traces over a large set of experiments across the providers and network types. We discover varying amounts of """"redundant"""" traffic in the presence of bandwidth adaptation across the services, which negatively impacts network resources. We also find these design choices lead to unfairness in bandwidth consumption on shared networks across different platforms. In particular, we find the Android Netflix player is able to take a larger fraction of shared bandwidth when competing with the iOS implementation."""	android;application programming interface;bandwidth management;experiment;hypertext transfer protocol;mobile device;mobile phone;network packet;streaming media;tablet computer;tracing (software);ios	Ahmed Mansy;Mostafa H.

This method finds a relative value for representing the stability of internet connections and can also be extended for aggregated internet connections. The method is documented with help of a real time implementation and results are shared. This proposed measurement scheme uses HTTP GET method for each connection(s). The normalized responses to identified sites like gateways of ISP’s, google.com etc are used for calculating current link stability. The novelty of the approach is that historic values are used to calculate overall link stability. In this discussion, we also document a method to use the calculated values as a dynamic threshold metric. This is used in routing decisions and for load-balancing each of the connections in an aggregated bandwidth pipe. This scheme is a very popular practice in aggregated internet connections.	gateway (telecommunications);google search;internet access;load balancing (computing);overhead (computing);real-time computing;routing;user experience;value (ethics)	M.

a0800316fedaa12324c7b2aefb4dcb5e5164bcfa	multipath quic: a deployable multipath transport protocol		QUIC is the emerging transport layer protocol, providing encrypted, stream-multiplexed, low-latency data transfer. In this paper, we propose multipath-enabled QUIC (MPQUIC) to leverage multiple network interfaces, such as WiFi and LTE on todayu0027s mobile devices. We show how our MPQUIC design conceptually evolves beyond existing multipathing protocols, such as MPTCP, as it provides fine-grained stream-to-path scheduling, reduced head-of-line blocking, and faster subflow establishment. We present an userland implementation of MPQUIC that is deployable without operating system changes. Our evaluation results show that MPQUIC increases throughput in comparison to traditional QUIC, TCP and even the currently de facto multipath transport protocol MPTCP. First real world measurements confirm that MPQUIC is deployable in the Internet to reduce download times. Moreover, we show that MPQUICu0027s conceptual advantages over MPTCP efficiently reduce head-of-line blocking in heterogeneous environments. With multipathing support, QUIC is ready to become the universal stream transport protocol in todayu0027s Internet.	blocking (computing);compaq lte;download;encryption;mobile device;multipath propagation;multiplexing;operating system;scheduling (computing);speedup;stream cipher;streaming media;throughput;transport layer security;user space	Tobias Viernickel;Alexander Frömmgen;Amr Rizk;Boris Koldehofe;Ralf Steinmetz	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8422951	throughput;computer network;multipath propagation;quic;scheduling (computing);the internet;network interface;computer science;transport layer;multiplexing	Mobile	-7.837354799643805	91.45149046992758	167591
140439883044f1cb8216c97ff73f2ee7cc4cebba	know your game: a bottom-up approach for gaming research		Recent advancements of network architecture such as 5G networks, promise cloud services with strict network constrains a bright future. Cloud gaming as an interactive service has strict end-to-end delay constraints. Therefore, many studies investigated the impact of network parameters such as delay or packet loss on gaming QoE. However, they mostly compared games or genres with each other and neglected the fact even two levels of the same game may have different sensitivity toward delay. In order to understand the game characteristics that cause this difference in delay sensitivity, a bottom-up approach by means of modifiable open source games can be of high value. In this paper we present a game designed to tackle this issue. The game allows to artificially change characteristics of the game, such as the pace and size of objects, and also simulate influences like delay, packet loss or a reduced frame rate. This allows the usage of the game also for crowdsourcing studies, where it is not possible to control the different network conditions of the participants, and to investigate the impact of spatial and temporal accuracy in respect to the sensitivity towards impairments.	cloud computing;cloud gaming;crowdsourcing;end-to-end principle;network architecture;network packet;open-source video game;samegame;simulation;source;top-down and bottom-up design	Sajad Mowlaei;Steven Schmidt;Saman Zadtootaghaj;Sebastian Möller	2018	2018 Tenth International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)	10.1109/QoMEX.2018.8463423	multimedia;real-time computing;packet loss;network architecture;frame rate;cloud computing;quality of experience;top-down and bottom-up design;computer science;cloud gaming;crowdsourcing	Mobile	-8.612916716377486	98.58422768197455	167664

d1792002cbe3e249513dd8df73a41e40aaeb3438	on the effectiveness of an optimization method for the traffic of tcp-based multiplayer online games		This paper studies the feasibility of using an optimization method, based on multiplexing and header compression, for the traffic of Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) using TCP at the Transport Layer. Different scenarios where a number of flows share a common network path are identified. The adaptation of the multiplexing method is explained, and a formula of the savings is devised. The header compression ratio is obtained using real traces of a popular game and a statistical model of its traffic is used to obtain the bandwidth saving as a function of the number of players and the multiplexing period. The obtained savings can be up to 60 % for IPv4 and 70 % for IPv6. A Mean Opinion Score model from the literature is employed to calculate the limits of the multiplexing period that can be used without harming the user experience. The interactions between multiplexed and non-multiplexed flows, sharing a bottleneck with different kinds of background traffic, are studied through simulations. As a result of the tests, some limits for the multiplexing period are recommended: the unfairness between players can be low if the value of the multiplexing period is kept under 10 or 20 ms. TCP background flows using SACK (Selective Acknowledgment) and Reno yield better results, in terms of fairness, than Tahoe and New Reno. When UDP is used for background traffic, high values of the multiplexing period may stress the unfairness between flows if network congestion is severe.	acknowledgment index;bottleneck (engineering);fairness measure;interaction;massively multiplayer online role-playing game;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;network congestion;simulation;statistical model;tracing (software);user experience	Jose Saldana	2015	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-015-3001-y	statistical time division multiplexing;simulation;max-min fairness;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-5.695875118711718	98.1685138466606	167793

This approach overcomes the cost of large-scale deployment of such services. An essential problem of this type of system is to limit the incurred congestion. In particular, overwhelming the uplink of some peers would create a large increase in the latency of the system and make this application less compelling. In this work we focus on limiting the congestion in a peer-to-peer network where multiple multicast trees are used to distribute video to a large set of receivers. We present the idea of congestion-distortion optimized streaming which aims at maximizing decoded video quality while limiting network congestion. We describe how this type of media scheduling maintains high video quality even for low latencies, and extend its usage to the peer-to-peer scenario. Experiments over a simulated network of 300 peers illustrate the benefits of the suggested approach.	distortion;multicast;network congestion;peer-to-peer;population;scheduling (computing);software deployment;streaming media;telecommunications link	Eric Setton;Jeonghun Noh;Bernd Girod	2006	2006 International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2006.312442	real-time computing;index term;computer science;video quality;distributed computing;network congestion;scheduling;computer network;low latency	Networks	-7.790791780360608	99.25908337871296	168150

To this end, we design a multimedia delivery protocol based on systematic network coding with partial feedback for reliable broadcast streaming over WLANs. Differently from other work, our approach takes into account the trade-off between (i) exploiting feedback-based encoded retransmissions at the multimedia broadcast source to compensate for the lack of MAC-layer error recovery mechanisms, and (ii) the efficient use of the wireless channel resources as given by the selected modulation scheme and the amount of feedback messages. The proposed protocol is tailored to the delay/packet loss rate demands of multimedia traffic and uses a combination of modulation rate and a forward error correction overhead which jointly leads to a minimal channel usage.	channel capacity;error detection and correction;forward error correction;linear network coding;modulation;network packet;overhead (computing);streaming media	Daniele Munaretto;Luca Scalia;Tushar Soni;Joerg Widmer	2009	2009 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications	10.1109/ISCC.2009.5202387	maintenance engineering;communications protocol;linear network coding;real-time computing;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;feedback;forward error correction;wireless;encoding;computer network;modulation	Mobile	-6.221918834561718	102.1604009161891	168173

For the ATM variable bit rate (VBR) channel, the channel rate is tightly restrained by the traffic contract negotiated before communication. The leaky-bucket based rate control algorithm proposed by us could meet the delay and traffic contract, so as to abstain the cell loss over the user-network interface (UNI). Furthermore, in order to benefit the statistical multiplexing and improve the overall decoded video quality, the burstiness of the MPEG encoded stream is reduced dramatically in our system. Our experiment shows that the algorithm is a good compromise between CBR (constant bit rate) and VBR video coding. And its implementation is so simple that it could be easily utilized in on-line rate control for real-time video communication.	algorithm;data compression;volume boot record	Junfeng Bai;Qingmin Liao;Xinggang Lin;Ying Jun Zhang	2000		10.1109/ICASSP.2000.859207	leaky bucket;experiment;statistical time division multiplexing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;video quality;asynchronous transfer mode;code rate;variable bitrate;constant bitrate;encoding;statistics;visual communication;computer network;satisfiability	Vision	-5.278911037806484	99.85500237200658	168488

These types of real-time services produce streams that are almost symmetrical in nature. A new token passing media access control (MAC) developed by our group, called wireless token network (WTN), has been designed with QoS guarantees in mind. We have previously shown in our previous paper (2006) that WTN supports a higher number of VoIP clients compared to 802.11e due to its higher channel efficiency. In this paper we show that WTN also provides superior QoS for bidirectional streams such as VIoIP due to a higher proportion of channel access given to the access point (AP). Performance results are generated by benchmarking WTN against IEEE 802.11 DCF, IEEE 802.11e EDCA and SpectraLink SVP MAC protocols. These results show that whilst appropriate for unidirectional traffic, these current popular solutions do not provide QoS for streams in both directions, due to design constraints which treat the access point as a single client node.	access control;best-effort delivery;design rule for camera file system;differentiator;lattice problem;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;real-time web;security token;throughput;while;wireless access point	Justin Wyatt;Daryoush Habibi;Iftekhar Ahmad;Hushairi Zen	2007	2007 15th IEEE International Conference on Networks	10.1109/ICON.2007.4444105	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;voice over ip;computer network	Embedded	-5.1156988968177535	94.3511111097422	168518

Multimedia delivery over the Internet has evolved rapidly over the past few years. The last decade has seen video streaming transitioning from User Datagram Protocol to Transmission Control Protocol-based technologies. Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) has recently emerged as a standard for Internet video streaming. A range of rate adaptation mechanisms are proposed for DASH systems in order to deliver video quality that matches the throughput of dynamic network conditions for a richer user experience. This survey paper looks at emerging research into the application of client-side, server-side, and in-network rate adaptation techniques to support DASH-based content delivery. We provide context and motivation for the application of these techniques and review significant works in the literature from the past decade. These works are categorized according to the feedback signals used and the end-node that performs or assists with the adaptation. We also provide a review of several notable video traffic measurement and characterization studies and outline open research questions in the field.	algorithm;bandwidth management;behavior-based robotics;bottleneck (engineering);categorization;client-side;content delivery network;control theory;datagram;digital distribution;download;dynamic adaptive streaming over http;experiment;feedback;heuristic (computer science);holism;hypertext transfer protocol;interaction;internet;mathematical model;open research;scalability;server (computing);server-side;software-defined networking;streaming media;throughput;user experience	Jonathan Kua;Grenville J.

This technology lets multiple virtual networks run on a shared physical infrastructure. A key step lies in mapping a virtual network request to a resource allocation in the network substrate. Previous approaches to this network embedding problem assumed the request will ask for specific resources, such as network capacity or computing power. However, the end-user is more interested in performance. This paper therefore considers a different request format, namely a request will ask for a certain quality of service (QoS). The infrastructure provider must then determine the resource allocation necessary for this QoS. In particular, the provider must take into account user reaction to perceived performance and adjust the allocation dynamically. To this end, we propose an estimation mechanism that is based on analyzing the interaction between user behavior and network performance. This approach can dynamically adjust resource estimations when QoS requirements change. Our simulation-based experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can satisfy user performance requirements through appropriate resource estimation. Moreover, our approach can adjust resource estimations efficiently and accurately.	experiment;internet explorer;network performance;perceived performance;quality of service;requirement;simulation;video	Bo-Chun Wang;Y.

acd06437ec4f77262a66eb21135c2e5977ac52a1	a study on qoe-qos relationship for multimedia services in satellite networks		The quality of experience (QoE) of users has become an important factor concerned by service providers to keep users for their services. The measurable quality of service (QoS) refers to technical performance, not the satisfaction of users, but it is closely related to user's QoE. Most existing researches mainly focus on studying the QoE-QoS relationship for services in terrestrial network with rare attention on satellite networks. Multimedia services delivery over satellite networks is a promising service in emerging future Internet, thus it is appealing to analyze how service QoE depend on QoS in satellite networks. In this paper, we build a simulated satellite network based on OPENT software to measure the QoS parameters and obtain the distorted videos/voices. Then, based on the original and distorted video/voice sequences, we perform a subjective test to obtain the subjective opinion scores representing user's QoE. Finally, on the basis of the collected data, the influence of single QoS parameter on QoE is analyzed and the QoS parameter thresholds to different QoE levels are provided.	future internet;mega man network transmission;network packet;quality of service;relay;simulation;terrestrial television	Shuang Xu;Xingwei Wang;Min Huang	2018	2018 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design ((CSCWD))	10.1109/CSCWD.2018.8465275	service provider;the internet;quality of service;packet loss;multimedia;software;quality of experience;computer science	Metrics	-10.037460244458845	100.22787086239275	169017

Furthermore, internet service providers are capping mobile data plans and this can lead to increased prices for mobile multimedia content users. This paper briefly presents the Cost Oriented adaptive MultimEdia DeliverY (COMEDY)- a mechanism that aims to reduce the cost of multimedia delivery over wireless networks by decreasing the bitrate and resolution of the multimedia clips. COMEDY takes into account the user's attitude towards risk when the adaptation is performed. The viewer trade-off between multimedia quality and the delivery cost is analysed. The results have shown that the price to be paid for accessing the adapted multimedia clip is considerably reduced for the case when the COMEDY mechanism was used.	frequency capping	Andreea Molnar;Cristina Hava Muntean	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB)	10.1109/BMSB.2013.6621787	multi-frequency network;mobile search;mobile qos;computer science;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;ip multimedia subsystem;wireless multimedia extensions	DB	-10.727745707272883	99.99354755582085	169102

In this paper, three factors representing clients' access to a media system are investigated to characterize popularity. One of the factors is the commonly used access frequency. Numerical studies on one of the workloads from a video-on-demand system in the University of Science and Technology of China are also given. The results show that the commonly used Zipf-like model is not suitable to characterize popularity distribution. However, the stretched exponential model is better, and the shape of the stretched exponential distribution of popularity is related to the characterization of popularity and the duration of workload. The rank correlation between the access frequency and the other two factors is further studied. It is concluded that the rank of video popularity and the ability of each characterization to distinguish video popularity are different, which implies that the combinative use of different characterizations can increase the distinction of video popularity.Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Standardization organizations are making Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) mandatory in their specifications. However, the concept of IPv6 covers many aspects and numerous specifications. In addition, the characteristics of cellular links in terms of bandwidth, cost and delay put special requirements on how IPv6 is used. This document considers IPv6 for cellular hosts that attach to the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), or Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks. This document also lists basic components of IPv6 functionality and discusses some issues relating to the use of these components when operating in these networks.

ZigBee is commonly used in wireless architecture and in controlling and monitoring applications. ZigBee's cost effective potential makes it highly likely that it will soon be used to transfer large amounts of data or stream video. However, ZigBee's current bandwidth is very low for video transmissions over IEEE 802.15.4 networks, therefore this will be difficult to achieve. Additionally, the ZigBee limitation could become a real problem if the user wishes to transmit a large amount of data in a very short time. Hence, in this paper a solution has been accomplished by applying Particle Swarm Optimization to Scalable Rate Control in order to increase the available bandwidth, which leads to both an improvement in the quality of picture and a reduction in the data loss when transmitting MPEG-4 video over the ZigBee wireless sensor networks.	case-based reasoning;computer simulation;data compression;group of pictures;kruskal's algorithm;mathematical optimization;moving picture experts group;network packet;particle swarm optimization;quantization (signal processing);scalability;transmitter;turing test;volume boot record;while	Iman Samizadeh;Hassan B.

To achieve this, the existing ATM protocol must be augmented with mobility management capabilities. One of the important components of mobility management is the ability of the network to seamlessly reroute existing connections to different parts of the network. To date, a number of schemes have been proposed for broadband wireless networks. These schemes can potentially be used in WATM networks. In this paper, we compare the performance of these schemes in terms of their complexity, handover latency, communication disruption period and buffer and bandwidth requirements.	atm turbo;connection-oriented communication;denial-of-service attack;requirement;routing	Bui A.

In order to tackle the “last mile” bottleneck for video delivery to the home, we propose a content-aware architecture, that incorporates popularity-dependent video patching with application-enabled multicast content delivery. The key idea is to exploit the Broadcast/Multicast Service Center (BM-SC) in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks, by forwarding individual requests for popular data to the BM-SC, and then to serve these requests efficiently by multicast content distribution. The proposed method offers a tremendous bandwidth saving, in comparison with the MAC-enabled multicasting currently exists in wireless networks. We analyze the conditions under which multicast content delivery offers a better QoS, in terms of service delay, over the individual service currently used for video streaming.

a06482828f0aa02e641721cd6ca8a8bde79f6317	is it cost-effective to share roadside infrastructure for internet access?		Vehicular networks have the potential to improve road safety using Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) technology, but substantial investment in roadside units (RSUs) is required. DSRC can be simultaneously used for safety and non-safety applications. If local governments share RSUs deployed for safety or smart streetlights with other kinds of service providers, then the respective costs can also be shared, thereby reducing costs for the government. We estimate that government could save about one fifth the nationwide cost of safety RSUs in the U.S. if they are shared with Internet service providers. We also estimate an increase in social welfare from sharing. The prices that maximize government savings and social welfare may differ. However, we find that maximizing government savings results in near-optimal social welfare.	internet access;offset binary;software deployment	Alexandre K. Ligo;Jon M.

Therefore, ‘smarter’networks have been proposed in order to cover this need. The cognitive packet network (CPN) is a routing protocol that provides QoS-driven routing and performs self-improvement in a distributed manner, by learning from the experience of special packets, which gather on-line QoS measurements and discover new routes. The CPN was first introduced in 1999 and has been used in several applications since then. Here we provide a comprehensive survey of its variations, applications and experimental performance evaluations.	best-effort delivery;coloured petri net;network packet;online and offline;packet switching;quality of service;routing	Georgia Sakellari	2010	Comput.

Examples of these technologies are Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), which are usually used in core networks. An important objective of network providers is to obtain the maximum profit from their resources; hence there is a need for an efficient resource management. Investigation in this field is difficult, mainly because network research laboratories do not have a large core network where they can investigate their approaches and algorithms. This paper presents a simple but flexible distributed simulator that supports a wide range of different experiments. It is based on an event-oriented simulation at a connection level (no packet or cell granularity). The distributed simulator is oriented to the simulation of large core networks and support different routing and admission control algorithms. The simulator must also support the development of different resource management architectures: centralised, distributed, hybrid, based on artificial intelligence techniques, etc. The paper also presents the scenario where this simulator can be used, mainly in the context of Traffic Engineering, i.e. dynamic bandwidth management and fast restoration mechanisms. Examples of different management applications and experiments performed using the simulator are presented. q 2003 Elsevier B.V.

These software applications operate in real-time communication scenarios and, at least in principle, should ensure portability and platform independence. In this paper a software IP telephony application completely written in Java language and called JavaNetPhone is presented. The aim of such a communication tool is to operate in a business LAN environment, based on the Media Gateway Control Protocol framework, to extend the already available telephony facilities. At the authors' best knowledge, other similar applications exist, but they adopt different programming languages and sometimes are not platform-independent. The prototype functionalities evaluation show that the application can give acceptable voice performance, and further developments are being pursued to provide the adoption of wireless communication technologies, such as BlueTooth and WiFi, according to the increasing demand for user's mobility.	bluetooth;java;programming language;prototype;real-time clock;real-time computing;software portability	Susanna Spinsante;Franco Chiaraluce;Ennio Gambi;Aldo Vespasiani;Alessio Perotti	2005	2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference		embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;computer network	Mobile	-18.817620463063705	90.22727155426459	170463

Applications communicate over the V net by using simplex end-to-end network connections which support speci c real-time and reliability characteristics tailored to meet the application's speci ed requirements. V net di ers from other proposed architectures in that it does not assume one speci c packet scheduling algorithm or a speci c tra c policing mechanism. Instead, the V net has been designed to support a variety of packet scheduling algorithms and tra c policing mechanisms. This exibility is an important design consideration as a real-time network architecture must accommodate existing and future multimedia applications.	algorithm;end-to-end principle;network architecture;network packet;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;requirement;scheduling (computing)	Brian Field;Taieb Znati;Daniel Mossé	1995		10.1109/INFCOM.1995.515997	real-time computing;network architecture;open network architecture;computer science;applications architecture;operating system;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Embedded	-4.584041646384885	97.48761551775914	170537

In this paper we compare the legacy BitTorrent protocol with EE-BitTorrent, a proxy-based version recently proposed for energy efficiency, in a residential scenario. We show that the performance achieved by users is strongly influenced by the uplink throughput allowed by the access network. When the available uplink rate is low, the legacy BitTorrent protocol performs poorly and EE-BitTorrent outperforms it, in terms of average download time and energy consumption at the user's PC. The opposite occurs when the uplink rate is good. Motivated by these results, we designed and implemented AdaBT, an adaptive algorithm that dynamically selects the most efficient BitTorrent option (i.e., legacy or proxy-based), depending on the operating conditions experienced by the user. Our experimental results show that AdaBT is able to reduce significantly the download time provided by either the legacy BitTorrent or EE-BitTorrent.	access network;adaptive algorithm;asymmetric digital subscriber line;bittorrent;download;peer-to-peer file sharing;telecommunications link;testbed;throughput	Ilaria Giannetti;Giuseppe Anastasi;Marco Conti	2012	2012 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2012.6249349	communications protocol;the internet;internet traffic;energy conservation;bittorrent;bittorrent protocol encryption;computer science;operating system;bittorrent tracker;efficient energy use;internet privacy;user interface;world wide web;file sharing;computer network	Metrics	-9.281085203604071	97.50159869119592	170654

a9e523bbbf6bad4edbc1ff05758140b0961e8312	using kernel density estimation to target customer complaint handling service		Nowadays customer experience is the most important factor affects the customer loyalty, especially in a mature market. Thus, a Complaint Process Platform (CPP) plays an important role in dealing with customer complaints; most of them are poor mobile coverage, frequent call drops and low speed on 4G. Usually, subscribes call service center directly and report issues to the agent. Many complaints can be resolved at this stage and no need to dispatch cases to the next level, a secondary agency that helps resolve complaints about telecom services. This paper introduces a method of kernel density estimation based on the locations of customer complaint by using kernel density function. This method targets hot zones with poor mobile coverage automatically and precisely and generates handling strategies, in order to improve the success rate of customer complaint handling at the service center. The process of designing the CPP metrics for telecommunication services is also given.	consistent pricing process;dynamic dispatch;java hotspot virtual machine;kernel (operating system);kernel density estimation;systems architecture	Hsin-Chieh Chao;Kai-An Tang;Yin-Hsin Liu;Chang-Yu Hsu	2017	2017 19th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)	10.1109/APNOMS.2017.8094130	marketing;computer network;complaint;customer intelligence;kernel density estimation;computer science;mature market;voice of the customer;loyalty business model;telecommunications service;computer security	AI	-15.348102974789347	100.19215495863958	171320

Mechanisms using this method have the advantage of requiring no extra traffic for measuring available bandwidth, whereas other active measurement tools cannot fundamentally avoid adding probing traffic onto the network. However, when the inline network measurement algorithms are implemented in general-purpose computers, some problems arise, such as the clock resolution of the kernel system, interrupt coalescence (IC) deployed in network interface cards, and the behavior of TCP receiver. In the present paper, we explain these difficulties and describe our current solutions. Furthermore, we implement the measurement algorithms and the solutions against those problems in a Free BSD 4.10 kernel system, and present some results on experimental networks. The experimentally obtained results are used to verify the solutions and to confirm the effectiveness of our concept, inline network measurement, on actual networks. We also compare the performance of the packet interval-based approaches and packet-burst interval-based approaches, and demonstrate that using packet-burst for the measurement in high-speed networks is quite effective."""	algorithm;bsd;bandwidth (signal processing);coalescing (computer science);code;computer;experiment;futures studies;general-purpose modeling;internet;kernel (operating system);network interface controller;network packet;network security;simulation	Tomoaki Tsugawa;Cao Le Thanh Man;Go Hasegawa;Masayuki Murata	2007	2007 Workshop on End-to-End Monitoring Techniques and Services	10.1109/E2EMON.2007.375314	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;computer network	Metrics	-6.304603963749021	91.03453355214359	171352

By limiting differentiation to a limited number of classes, one can rely on simple trafJic meters, queue management and scheduling mechanisms. Possible differentiation measures are bandwidth, delay and drop probability. It is clear that requirements of an application can be based on each of these measures or on a combination. This paper describes a new service that combines loss and delay differentiution to provide throughput differentiation for TCP microflows. The basic idea behind this service uses advances in TCP performance characterization showing that TCP throughput is a function of the incurred network delay and the experienced Loss. We show that combined relative delay and loss differentiation leads to bandwidth differentiation for individual TCP micro-flows.	bandwidth (signal processing);differentiated service;differentiated services;internet protocol suite;non-functional requirement;scheduling (computing);smart meter;throughput	Timothy Soetens;Stefaan De Cnodder;Omar Elloumi	2001		10.1109/CCGRID.2001.923249	throughput;real-time computing;scalability;the internet;tcp global synchronization;quality of service;differentiated service;computer science;probability;distributed computing;queue management system;zeta-tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;scheduling;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;transport layer;network delay;bandwidth;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Networks	-5.4620246904449665	94.98124682541699	171412

In particular, the ability to perform this task in real time (typically for streams sent themselves in real time) is specially interesting. The problem is still unsolved because there are many parameters a ecting video quality and because their combined e ect is not well identi ed and understood. Among these parameters we have the source bit rate, the encoded frame type, the frame rate at the source, the packet loss rate in the network, etc. Only subjective evaluations give good results but, by de nition, they are not automatic. We previously explored the possibility of using Arti cial Neural Networks to automatically quantify the quality of video ows and we showed that they can give results well correlated with human perception. In this paper, our goal is twofold: First, we report on a signi cant enhancement of our method by means of a new neural approach, the Random Neural Network model. Second, we follow our approach to study and analyze the behavior of video quality for wide range variations of a set of selected parameters. This may help in developing control mechanisms in order to deliver the best possible video quality given the current network situation, and in better understanding of QoS aspects in multimedia engineering.

The WAVE/DSRC network removes the layer-2 association procedure and thus greatly differs from traditional WiFi technologies. With this capability, critical information can be sent within a very short period, making it suitable for realizing Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) safety applications and Roadside-to-Vehicle (R2V) Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. In a recent project, the WAVE/DSRC technology has been studied for the use of speed enforcement system. This paper presents a case study of integrating the state-of-the-art WAVE/DSRC technology into a new-type of speed enforcement system called the Augmented Speed Enforcement (aSE) system. The design, the architecture, and the details of field tests in Los Banos, California, will be discussed. In addition, experimental results regarding the DSRC and 3G radio performance in the field will be analyzed in this paper.	protocol stack;server (computing);traffic enforcement camera;transmitter;vehicle-to-vehicle;window of opportunity	Kuan-Lin Chiu;Chih-Che Lin;Somak Datta Gupta;Ching-Yao Chan	2013	16th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2013)	10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728409	vehicular ad hoc network;telecommunications;engineering;vehicular communication systems;computer security;computer network	Robotics	-16.816688787740574	90.80706870906631	171663

In this context sustainability and the best use of developed infrastructures are highly critical. While many facilities have reached a level of maturity that allows them to be opened up to a wider use, mainly the academic sectors have been targeted. The Fanning out Testbeds-as-a-Service for the EIT ICT1 (FanTaaStic) project explores best practices, has performed a gap analysis, investigates applicable business models and works out a concept for the operation of a self-sustainable commercial testbed service offering. For defining the operational model, an analysis of available tools and frameworks from past and current Future Internet testbed projects is being carried out, based on a standard framework that defines the required processes and applications for the carrier grade operation of telecommunication infrastructures and provisioning of services. The business model is defined as a gradually growing service offering, based on categories of a framework for IT Service Management in federated e-infrastructures. The applicability of both, the developed business and operational model for such a sustainable federation will initially be implemented and evaluated in 2014.	best practice;capability maturity model;carrier grade;electromagnetically induced transparency;experiment;future internet;gap analysis;provisioning;testbed	Alexander Willner;Stephan Albrecht;Stefan Covaci;Florian Schreiner;Thomas Magedanz;Susanna Avessta;Ciro Scognamiglio;Serge Fdida;Udo Bub	2014	2014 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS)	10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838379	the internet;simulation;computer science;management science;software testing;management;law;computer security;computer network	SE	-17.172312764293395	92.17984426753779	171673

Legacy marker systems mark video packets mainly based on the coding types of corresponding frames in order to achieve priority transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel packet marker system for realtime H.264 video delivery. Our system marks packets depending on the corresponding frames' contribution to the video quality. The frame relative importance index (FRII) is defined to estimate each frame's contribution, using the degradation of video quality caused by the loss of information in that frame. Consequently, packets of each frame are differently protected according to the FRII in delivery and the video perceptual quality is improved. Simulation results show that our system outperforms the legacy marker systems in terms of the quality of the delivered H.264 video streams.	differentiated services;elegant degradation;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;ip traceback;item unique identification;network packet;real-time transcription;simulation;streaming media	Fan Li;Guizhong Liu	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo	10.1109/ICME.2007.4285107	media delivery index;real-time computing;scalability;degradation;quality of service;visual perception;computer science;video quality;video tracking;block-matching algorithm;multimedia;motion compensation;computer network	Embedded	-6.59086463283699	100.8636695093358	171943

WebRTC allows communication between browsers and uses application layer mechanisms to assure the quality (e.g. congestion control), but would benefit from network layer mechanisms. In this paper we evaluate specialized network treatment based on queuing management for uplink in wired access networks. We propose a test environment and later, based on application and network layer measurements, we assess the impact of proposed solutions on WebRTC quality. We prove that best effort is not enough to assure WebRTC communication in a presence of TCP flows and that network layer mechanisms can significantly improve the perceived quality of WebRTC communication.	access network;active queue management;best-effort delivery;control system;deployment environment;enterprise integration;network congestion;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time web;telecommunications link;token bucket;webrtc;wireless access point	Ewa Janczukowicz;Arnaud Braud;Stéphane Tuffin;Ahmed Bouabdallah;Jean-Marie Bonnin	2016	2016 24th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)	10.1109/SOFTCOM.2016.7772141	real-time computing;computer science;computer security;computer network	HPC	-7.53409276127532	92.41115061593587	172070

The goal is to deliver seamless mobility for both TCP-based and UDP-based applications taking the best features from each mobility management scheme. In short, this paper proposes that TCP connections are handled through Mobile IP while UDP-based connection-less applications may use the Session Initiation Protocol for handling mobility. The two mobility management solutions are integrated into one common solution.	connectionless communication;mobile ip;seamless3d	Karl Andersson;Muslim Elkotob;Christer Åhlund	2008		10.1145/1543137.1543162	telecommunications;computer science;session initiation protocol;computer security;mobile ip;computer network	Mobile	-11.663765716782049	90.0382788790114	172291

They further rely on instantaneous signal strength measurements when choosing the best AP. This approach leads to handoff delays on the order of 1-2 seconds that are unacceptable for delay sensitive applications such as VoIP. We propose a fundamentally new approach to handoffs that is based on continuous monitoring of wireless links. In our approach, a client measures the beacon strengths of all the APs operating on the current, and the overlapping channels, and makes its handoff decisions based on the long-term, and short-term trends in these signals. We show through experiments in a campus wireless network that our proposed algorithms result in more than 50% reduction in average handoff delays, while having the potential to improve overall user performance. Our algorithms have been implemented in today's hardware, and unlike other proposed roaming algorithms in the literature, need no infrastructure support.	algorithm;experiment;propagation delay;requirement;throughput	Vivek P.

With low orbit and short range as compared to geostationary satellites, LEO satellites are accessible by mobile devices with limited transmission power and small gain antennas. The drawback, however, is that LEO satellites move fast across the sky with average contact time in the order of 10 minutes, thus requiring frequent handover from one satellite to the next. To achieve smooth handover and efficiently utilize constellation capacity, we propose to use Multipath TCP (MPTCP) in LEO systems and maintain parallel, simultaneous connections between terrestrial handpoints via multiple satellites. In this paper, we discuss the feasibility of using MPTCP over LEO satellite networks and propose a framework of MPTCP-Routing design. Then the performance of this protocol is evaluated through simulation. We show that compared to traditional “single-path” TCP, MPTCP significantly improves throughput performance and prevents the interruption of transmission during handover. Furthermore, we show that our MPTCP-Routing interaction is essential for the end-to-end session to quickly recover from handover.	access network;end-to-end encryption;geosynchronous satellite;internet protocol suite;interrupt;leo (computer);mobile device;multipath propagation;multipath routing;routing;shortest path problem;simulation;source routing;tcp congestion control;terrestrial television;throughput;ubiquitous computing	Pengyuan Du;Xiao Li;You Lu;Mario Gerla	2015	2015 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2015.7288928	telecommunications;multipath routing;computer network	Mobile	-8.60232435486802	90.2218278359279	172630

Firstly, the main problems which occur in this area are analyzed in this paper. Then solutions are given based on our experimental platform which has an universal, object-oriented teleservice model for describing the parties involved in the session, the media used for communication and the allocated network and terminal resources. The objects of this model are created and updated by a service layer signaling protocol. The proposed resource management system provides guaranteed service quality for any kind of multimedia service. The Movie-on-Demand service is described in order to illustrate our concept. The benefits of using hierarchical management layers from the resource reservation's point of view are highlighted by a simulation study.

0d05cb0acc4c6d01d2d9421601cd656d1528d543	secure emergent data protection scheme for a space-terrestrial integrated network		With the continuous development and increasing popularity of satellite networks, more and more countries and researchers are focusing on proposing communication solutions for satellite networks. The space-terrestrial integrated network (STIN) concept is proposed for terrestrial users to communicate with satellite networks. STIN is mainly composed of a space-based backbone network, a space-based access network, and a terrestrial backbone network to provide services for all types of space-based users, aviation-based users, marine-based users, and land-based users. For instance, marine-based users often encounter sudden accidents in distant oceans, which may need emergency rescue with the help of STIN. The emergency data involved in the rescue is often users' private data and needs to be protected. In this article, we propose a novel secure emergency data protection scheme for such users in a STIN. The novel scheme is composed of three phases: emergency data transmission, group block-design- based key agreement, and secure satellite information acquisition. The performance analysis shows that the novel scheme is secure and efficient.

This model can well be combined with the advantages of the recursive optimal per-pixel estimate model and the channel simulative estimate model. A specific packet loss-rate channel distortion is calculated by a few special channel simulators first.Then other packet loss-rate channel distortions are calculated by the relationship between packet loss-rate and channel distortion. The estimation accuracy is demonstrated via simulation results from video transmission over packet loss channel. The average estimation error is 9.4% for different intensity sequences at different packet loss-rates, which illustrates that the actual distortion can be estimated accurately and quickly by the proposed model.	distortion;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;network packet;pixel;propagation of uncertainty;recursion;simulation;software propagation	Qing-ming Zhang;Qiang Peng;Jim X.

An NR method is employed at a reference node with optimal reception. In this node the video impairments are only due to the acquisition and the TV station coding process, since the received digital TV signal is the same as the broadcasted. An FR method runs at the other receiving nodes, located at different geographic spots, where signal can be hit by different patterns of packet losses due to the transmission process. The FR method compares the signal received at these nodes with the one received at the reference node. The overall video quality in each geographic spot is calculated by combining the original quality estimation obtained with the NR method and the effects of transmission impairments obtained with the FR method. We show how this design overpasses the performance of previous NR developed methods.	audio system measurements;elegant degradation;experience;location (geography);network packet;noise reduction;polqa;real-time computing;tv tuner card	José Joskowicz;Rafael G.

bbd082a65ce7f00da4f1ae0cef31e3b06ae8e907	improving performances in league of legends by exploiting inter-operator peering		In recent years we are witnessing an increasing interest of young players in Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas (MOBAs). In a MOBA, two or more teams compete for resources on a limited map with real-time interactions. In order to achieve the required level of coordination, network performances must offer to each player an adequate and uniform Round Trip Time (RTT) to the game server. Unfortunately, different ISPs will give different RTTs based on technical and commercial settings. In this paper, we define an overlay network to convey all the team traffic through the teammate with the lowest end-to-end delay to the game server. By doing so, we leverage on the peering between ISPs, usually offering better performances due to commercial agreements, to obtain an homogeneous and bounded delay for all team members. The proposed solution has been tested using the popular game League of Legends. In this paper preliminary, and promising, results are presented.

c206fe8ed5b2bc68344fe162e9ee1d3aaf1fbc4c	restructuring endpoint congestion control		This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a system to implement complex congestion control functions by placing them in a separate agent outside the datapath. Each datapath---such as the Linux kernel TCP, UDP-based QUIC, or kernel-bypass transports like mTCP-on-DPDK---summarizes information about packet round-trip times, receptions, losses, and ECN via a well-defined interface to algorithms running in the off-datapath Congestion Control Plane (CCP). The algorithms use this information to control the datapath's congestion window or pacing rate. Algorithms written in CCP can run on multiple datapaths. CCP improves both the pace of development and ease of maintenance of congestion control algorithms by providing better, modular abstractions, and supports aggregation capabilities of the Congestion Manager, all with one-time changes to datapaths. CCP also enables new capabilities, such as Copa in Linux TCP, several algorithms running on QUIC and mTCP/DPDK, and the use of signal processing algorithms to detect whether cross-traffic is ACK-clocked. Experiments with our user-level Linux CCP implementation show that CCP algorithms behave similarly to kernel algorithms, and incur modest CPU overhead of a few percent.	acknowledgement (data networks);algorithm;central processing unit;clock rate;communication endpoint;control flow;control function (econometrics);control plane;dpdk / dpdk.org;datapath;explicit congestion notification;kernel (operating system);linux;network congestion;network packet;overhead (computing);signal processing;tcp congestion control;user space	Akshay Narayan;Frank Cangialosi;Deepti Raghavan;Prateesh Goyal;Srinivas Narayana;Radhika Mittal;Mohammad Alizadeh;Hari Balakrishnan	2018		10.1145/3230543.3230553	quic;computer network;signal processing;computer science;linux kernel;datapath;network congestion;restructuring;real-time computing;network packet;modular design	Networks	-6.331388710234996	90.60610696629024	174009

In this paper we present the modeling and performance evaluation of these two protocols and a hybrid protocol. We first present eeeBond, pronounced ``triple-e bond'', which combines the eBond capability to switch between multiple redundant interfaces with EEE's active/idle toggling capability implemented in each interface. Second, we present an analytic model of the protocol performance, and derive closed-form expressions for the optimized parameter settings of both eBond and eeeBond. Third, we present a performance evaluation that characterizes the relative performance gains possible with the optimized protocols, as well as a trace-based evaluation that validates the insights from the analytic model. Our results show that there are significant advantages to combine eBond and EEE. The eBond capability provides good savings when interfaces only offer small energy savings when in short-term sleep states, and the EEE capability is important as short-term sleep savings improve.	glossary of computer graphics;performance evaluation;router (computing)	Niklas Carlsson	2016		10.1145/2851553.2851564	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;engineering;efficient energy use	Networks	-6.82528469825491	91.39240475423017	174061

""""Wavelet-based video coding has been recently added to the JPEG-2000 video standards. As wavelet encoded video emerges as the next generation video encoding method, it is vital to compare the efficiency of wavelet encoded video against the widely used DCT-based MPEG encoded video. However, due to the lack of long wavelet encoded video streams, most research has so far been based on short video traces. This paper presents a comparison study on MPEG vs wavelet encoded video traces for one hour movie excerpts with rate control. These long video sequences allow for the evaluation of long range dependency and self similarity of the generated video traffic, which has not been studied before in the context of comparing DCT and wavelet-based encoding. We focus on the elementary as well as self-similar traffic characteristics of the encoded video. A hump behavior for the variability of frame sizes is observed for increasing video bit rates for both wavelet and MPEG encoded video. In addition, the quality characteristics of the encoded video is examined and related to the traffic. Our results indicate that the wavelet encoded video results in higher video quality than MPEG encoded video. For the frame size variability we find different characteristics depending on the aggregation level for a given data rate. The results also indicate that the variation of quality resulting from the wavelet encoding is lower than for the MPEG encoded video"""	data compression;discrete cosine transform;encode;internet;jpeg 2000;moving picture experts group;next-generation network;self-similarity;spatial variability;streaming media;tracing (software);uncompressed video;video clip;wavelet	Beshan Kulapala;Patrick Seeling;Martin Reisslein	2004	Proceedings. 13th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (IEEE Cat.

Nowadays, it is obvious that the whole range of services is widely in use. In addition, performance is degrading due to the rapidly increasing number of mobile subscribers, numbering over 2.9 billion subscribers around the world. The performance of cellular networks is the most important issue concerning their operators. The main goal is to keep subscribers satisfied with the delivered quality of service (QoS). In order to achieve the best performance, service providers have to monitor and optimize their network continuously. A Network Management System (NMS) with an online database is responsible for the collection of data on live networks. For greater effectiveness, operators install systems that do a lot more than collect and store raw data. These systems are easier to use and take advantage of all the data provided by the NMS. In this paper, we summarize measurements that were carried out on an operative GSM-1900 network to evaluate the performance of the GSM's Air-Interface (Um), during eight months. In this paper we have established statistically the following facts: (i) The peak hour in North America is between 4:00 and 5:00 PM. (ii) During week days the duration of calls increases from Monday through Friday. (iii) Weekend traffic is different from week-days traffic. Using a regression analysis we forecast traffic over time. The presented KPIs along with the derived statistical facts are crucial for operators who are concerned with maintaining a reliable and stable network, while maintaining an acceptable QoS.	management system;no man's sky;quality of service;traffic analysis;unified model	Mohammed Boulmalf;Jawad Abrache;Tarik Aouam;Hamid Harroud	2009	2009 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications	10.1109/AICCSA.2009.5069370	gsm;cellular network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer security;statistics;computer network	DB	-15.220656581961476	100.13203154269007	174249

In IEEE 802.11ac wireless local area networks, enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) is the primarily adopted access control mechanism for multimedia traffic transmission. However, the performance is degraded due to the unpredictable delay caused by its inefficient backoff procedure. To achieve high quality of service/experience, this paper proposes a multipolling controlled access (MPCA) scheme to guarantee the latency in delivering important video frames while reducing transmission overhead. We also propose a cross-layer designed quality adjustment strategy to maximize the visual experience. Furthermore, the downlink multiuser multiple-input–multiple-output feature in IEEE 802.11ac is exploited to enhance the reliability of MPCA. Theoretical analysis is provided to show high efficiency of MPCA.

A new standard called Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (MBMS) is being developed by 3GPP to enable new class of spectrum-efficient multimedia services. Multicast services are expected to serve a diverse user base with varying connectivity and capabilities. We analyze the problem of video error resilience in MBMS services that is critical to maintain consistent quality for end users. The existing error resilience techniques for IP multicasting are not applicable in the MBMS environment. In this paper, we present error resilience techniques that are applicable within the context of the MBMS standard. We propose an Intra Block Refresh method for MBMS services and the results show improved performance. We develop a methodology that can be applied to adapting traditional error resilience tools for the MBMS environment.	mobile device;multimedia broadcast multicast service;refresh rate;springer (tank);whole earth 'lectronic link	Sanigepalli Praveenkumar;Hari Kalva;Borko Furht	2006	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-006-6142-1	multicast;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;multimedia broadcast multicast service;computer network	HPC	-8.30722683286949	100.30455175885204	174551
0b4d5b14704dd8179319146d8cd81fd1cedee383	amuse: adaptive multicast services to very large groups - project overview		WiFi multicast to very large groups has gained attention as a solution for multimedia delivery in crowded areas. Yet, most recently proposed approaches do not provide performance guarantees. In this paper, we describe the AMuSe system, whose objective is to enable scalable and adaptive WiFi multicast services. AMuSe includes a lightweight feedback mechanism that allows monitoring channel quality of a large number of users. This feedback allows the system to dynamically optimize the multicast transmission rate at the AP. We implemented AMuSe on the ORBIT testbed and evaluated its performance in large groups with approximately 200 WiFi devices in different scenarios. We show that AMuSe supports high throughput multicast flows to hundreds of receivers while meeting quality requirements and that it outperforms other systems.	compaq lte;design review (u.s. government);digital distribution;elegant degradation;experiment;feedback;letter-quality printer;multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;requirement;scalability;streaming media;testbed;throughput;venue (sound system)	Yigal Bejerano;Varun Gupta;Craig Gutterman;Gil Zussman	2016	2016 25th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2016.7568491	real-time computing;multicast;telecommunications;operating system;distributed computing;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network	HPC	-11.359840009730659	96.29827640392608	174595

In particular, rate adaptation and fairness issues among sectors in directional multicast are not well-studied topics. In this paper, a fair rate adaptation scheme (FRAS) that seeks to determine appropriate transmission rates that maintain fairness among sectors and accommodate as many multicast devices as possible is proposed. Extensive simulation results show that FRAS outperforms the equal-rate scheme in terms of the number of devices that receive multicast frames. Furthermore, FRAS can improve the fairness performance as compared with the heavy-sector first scheme.	data compression;fairness measure;gigabit;multicast;scalability;scalable video coding;scheme;simulation	Wonjung Kim;Taewon Song;Sangheon Pack	2014	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-013-1551-8	multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network	Mobile	-10.258794905786965	96.1201287063363	174652

MMTel comprises a number of media components such as voice over IP (VoIP), real-time video, text messaging and file sharing. In this paper down-link scheduling performance of MMTel services for various scheduling algorithms is investigated in an HSDPA system. The studied service mixes include VoIP and file download (FTP), as well as VoIP and real-time video. The investigation of the schedulers is done over a wide range of traffic mix ratios, in order to give a full understanding of the performance. This paper shows that it is beneficial to have separate schedulers for each media flow. For an MMTel scenario with VoIP and file downloading, the best performance is achieved when using a delay scheduler for VoIP and a proportional fair (PF) scheduler for FTP. An extra priority weight for VoIP over FTP (or v.v.) makes it possible to control the wanted total service mix. With simultaneous VoIP and real-time video the best performance is achieved when both services utilize a delay scheduler, this since the VoIP and video flows shall be synchronized. However, the scheduler for the video flow requires different parameter settings, compared to the VoIP flow, in order to give the best performance.	algorithm;download;file sharing;multimedia telephony;proportionally fair;real-time clock;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link	Mårten Ericson;Stefan Wänstedt	2007	2007 IEEE 65th Vehicular Technology Conference - VTC2007-Spring	10.1109/VETECS.2007.269	embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;voice over ip;mobile communications over ip;computer network	Embedded	-4.643875486282795	98.18914860007442	174960

Future mobile broadband IP networks will be generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) based. Many protection and restoration (P&R) techniques have been developed to improve survivability in GMPLS-based IP networks. We propose an efficient two-level P&R scheme for GMPLS-based IP networks. In the scheme, LSP (label switched path) P&R is the first level and LSP segment P&R is the second level. An LSP protection path selection (LPPS) algorithm has been designed for the proposed scheme. The protection path establishment acceptance rate can be improved in the scheme. The proposed scheme achieves better quality of service (QoS) and reliability guarantees. In addition, a shorter failure recovery time can be obtained.	algorithm;apollonian network;circuit restoration;generalized multi-protocol label switching;global communications conference;internet protocol suite;multiprotocol label switching;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;segment protection	Qing Huang;Geng-Sheng Kuo	2004	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2004.

To establish a TCP connection, one must associate an IP address with a port number for both sender and receiver. However, in wireless environments mobile hosts are subject to change their attachment point during communication, this process is called handoff. Thus, in mobile environments the TCP operation is more complicated, because the mobile moves from one cell to another and it changes of network’s domain, then it acquires a new temporary IP address. Hence, the TCP packet loss is increased. Mobile IP was developed to manage the user mobility in wireless networks. However, this protocol is not adapted to support TCP session throughout the handover process. In this study, we have modeled the proposed architecture which ensures the continuity of TCP connection when a mobile executes a handover. We have evaluated the performance of the architecture by an analytical model. keywords: TCP connections, Mobile IP, handoff inter-domain, Queuing networks.	attachments;inter-domain;internet protocol suite;mobile ip;network packet;scott continuity;stationary process	Jalel Ben-Othman;Lynda Mokdad;Octavio Ramirez Rojas	2006	IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications, 2006.	10.1109/AICCSA.2006.205069	radio link protocol;tcp delayed acknowledgment;tcp global synchronization;tcp pacing;telecommunications;computer science;windows vista networking technologies;tcp hole punching;wireless network;transmission control protocol;distributed computing;zeta-tcp;tcp tuning;datagram;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;computer network	Mobile	-11.299698388072605	90.22353608048327	175063
73a6d7340a76ec6a1186539358a3b59bfcf37a02	enhanced split tcp with end-to-end protocol semantics over wireless networks		The global mobile traffic is exponentially growing and more than 90% of the Internet traffic uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for reliable transmission. However, TCP is known to perform poorly over unreliable wireless networks. One of the promising families of solutions to improve the performance of TCP is centered on Split-TCP. However, while Split-TCP may improve the protocol performance, it is vulnerable due to the broken end-to-end semantics. Several variants have been proposed to overcome this pitfall, but while they address the broken semantics, they also defeat the main purpose by compromising the TCP performance gains. In this paper, we propose a novel Enhanced Split-TCP (ES-TCP) mechanism, which significantly improves the application throughput without breaking the end-to-end TCP semantics. Experimental results show that the proposed ES-TCP may boost the TCP throughput by more than 60% in average when exercised over an operational 4G LTE network. Furthermore, the TCP throughput performance improvement may be even over 200%, depending on the network and usage conditions. We expect such throughput gains may be even greater when advanced radio technologies, such as 5G, are deployed. For these reasons, the ES-TCP is a promising transport layer solution for the current and next generation networks.	compaq lte;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;internet protocol suite;next-generation network;throughput	Bong-Ho Kim;Doru Calin;Insup Lee	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925842	radio link protocol;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;bic tcp;transmission control protocol;distributed computing;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;scalable tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;computer network	Mobile	-4.989488591358046	91.74700564442131	175216

It was developed in the context of the AN project of the European Union Sixth Framework Program. Network composition is a core concept of ANs, envisioned to allow a level of network cooperation, which goes far beyond the static cooperation of today. It allows on-demand, autonomous, scalable, and uniform cooperation between heterogeneous networks. Ambient networks can host several registries (e.g. MIB and SQL database). When ANs compose, the hosted registries need to compose. Registry composition is a sub-process of network composition. Information discovery is a key feature of registry composition. Entities may need access to content hosted by a registry that was in a different network before composition. The interface of such a registry (e.g. SNMP and SQL) may be different from the one used by the interested entity. Our objective is to provide clients the ability to autonomously and seamlessly access the content of registries in the composed network. This paper proposes a solution based on an overlay network. We give background information on ambient networks, network composition, and registry composition. Related work is reviewed. The overlay network and its implementation are described, and its performance is evaluated. & 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Multicasting is effective method whether it is video, voice, or other forms of data when large quantities of receiving users are involved. Multicasting allows a single form of a signal to be transmitted with network protocols managing the mass delivery. The major issue is fairness, which is the desire for the multicast traffic not to overwhelm other usual traffic such as standard TCP traffic. The need for speed of UDP and its designed nature of obtaining as much bandwidth as possible is what causes the issue of negative impact on competing TCP flows. Therefore a goal of operation is to control UDP traffic and use to its potential without disrupting other types of traffic. Shortcomings and any advantageous features of current protocols will be analysed to find mechanisms to assist in improving traffic friendliness. The focus of this dissertation is to analyse aspects of an amalgamation of core stateless fair queuing and stabilised random early drop along with other ideas in an attempt to offer an improved scheme for layered multicast fairness that will form a new protocol called stabilised CSFQ	communications protocol;effective method;fair queuing;fairness measure;internet;multicast;network congestion;network packet;random early detection;simulation;stateless protocol;streaming media;the need for speed;throughput	Nick Josevski;Naveen K.

Previous research has shown its utility in clustering traffic and detecting traffic anomalies. While measuring the entropy of the traffic observed at a single point has already been studied, an interesting open problem is to measure the entropy of the traffic between every origin-destination pair. In this paper, we propose the first solution to this challenging problem. Our sketch builds upon and extends the Lp sketch of Indyk with significant additional innovations. We present calculations showing that our data streaming algorithm is feasible for high link speeds using commodity CPU/memory at a reasonable cost. Our algorithm is shown to be very accurate in practice via simulations, using traffic traces collected at a tier-1 ISP backbone link.	central processing unit;cluster analysis;entropy (information theory);internet backbone;sensor;simulation;streaming algorithm;tier 1 network;tracing (software)	Haiquan Zhao;Ashwin Lall;Mitsunori Ogihara;Oliver Spatscheck;Jia Wang;Jun Xu	2007		10.1145/1298306.1298345	simulation;entropy estimation;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;mathematics;statistics	Metrics	-6.296051635809513	89.89668609301326	175950
a79983b2cf4852aaeab43e66cab948a2f00c90a3	coupled congestion control for multipath transport protocols		"""Often endpoints are connected by multiple paths, but communications are usually restricted to a single path per connection. Resource usage within the network would be more efficient were it possible for these multiple paths to be used concurrently. Multipath TCP is a proposal to achieve multipath transport in TCP. New congestion control algorithms are needed for multipath transport protocols such as Multipath TCP, as single path algorithms have a series of issues in the multipath context. One of the prominent problems is that running existing algorithms such as standard TCP independently on each path would give the multipath flow more than its fair share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one of its subflows. Further, it is desirable that a source with multiple paths available will transfer more traffic using the least congested of the paths, achieving a property called """"resource pooling"""" where a bundle of links effectively behaves like one shared link with bigger capacity. This would increase the overall efficiency of the network and also its robustness to failure. This document presents a congestion control algorithm that couples the congestion control algorithms running on different subflows by linking their increase functions, and dynamically controls the overall aggressiveness of the multipath flow. The result is a practical algorithm that is fair to TCP at bottlenecks while moving traffic away from congested links."""	algorithm;bottleneck (network);multipath propagation;network congestion	Costin Raiciu;Mark Handley;Damon Wischik	2011	RFC	10.17487/RFC6356	tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;computer science;multipath routing;delay spread;distributed computing;zeta-tcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;computer network	Networks	-5.466929052489237	91.93436086886427	176220

A SON is an overlay network made up of virtual nodes and links on top of the existing infrastructure. Whenever a client requests a specific service, such as streaming a video on his mobile device, the SON creates a path on the fly to deliver the video stream from the server to the client. This path is called a Service Specific Overlay Network (SSON) and consists of nodes that meet the Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Experience (QoE), and technical requirements of the user. Unfortunately, the highly dynamic nature of overlay networks makes it challenging to keep video quality at the required levels. Errors and delays due mainly to congestion cause packets to be dropped or queued for a long period of time in intermediate nodes. Video quality is greatly affected by such impairments. In this paper, we propose a utility function to predict QoE of video delivered over SSONs. The proposed function is based on application-level statistical information, namely frame delay. It allows user QoE to be monitored in real-time without incurring additional overhead on the network. When degradation in the utility is detected, appropriate adaptation schemes can be used to restore the QoE to acceptable levels. We show the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed scheme via mathematical proofs and simulation results.	bandwidth (signal processing);byte;computation;computer simulation;elegant degradation;iptv;itil;mobile device;network congestion;on the fly;overhead (computing);overlay network;quality of service;real-time clock;requirement;server (computing);simulation;streaming media;utility	Imad Abdeljaouad;Ahmed Karmouch	2013	2013 IEEE 10th Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2013.6488445	media delivery index;the internet;overlay network;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	-6.9130853951779345	98.47499790777815	176493

The customization method is “semi-tailored” in the sense that it provides the users with a means of adjusting the buffering time so that it can maximize his/her own QoE. This paper examines the feasibility of the basic idea for interactive GPSQ and the customization method through a minimum number of conversational opinion tests, i.e., two tasks with different visual effects. For that purpose, we have built a simple experimental system of interactive GPSQ and made experiment on QoE assessment with and without the customization method. The experiment showed that the interactive GPSQ is feasible and that the customization improves QoE.	algorithm;experimental system;internet protocol suite;network packet;next-generation network;packet delay variation;playout;scheduling (computing);semiconductor industry;speech enhancement;visual effects	Shuji Tasaka;Norihito Misaki	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo	10.1109/ICME.2010.5582594	real-time computing;next-generation network;computer science;multimedia;computer network	Robotics	-7.81091402225733	100.00135710138002	176521

Moreover, cellular phone users are being accustomed to have all Internet services in the mobile device, through 3G or WiFi technology, with the same quality of experience (QoE) than in any desktop computer or laptop with broadband Internet connection. In this paper we present a network management algorithm and protocol for ubiquitous networks based on the QoE of the end user. First, we explain the developed protocol and algorithm, that uses the information provided by the mobile device and the bandwidth, jitter, delay and packet loss of the end user, in order to decide which is the most appropriate video features and the best coding technique to deliver the video streams. A video controller server decides which video server, from a farm of servers, is the best one for each case. We show the algorithm performance when each coding technique is changed in the server due to transcoding process, and the network performance in terms of jitter, delay and lost packets received by the end user when each coding technique is selected by the video controller server.	algorithm;iptv	Jaime Lloret Mauri;Alejandro Canovas;Jesús Tomás;Marcelo Atenas	2012	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2012.06.002	media delivery index;communications protocol;real-time computing;computer science;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	-8.46683869256912	99.40405683959779	176759

For each scheme, analytical models are developed for mobility costs taking into consideration all the related aspects. We consider the signaling, data packet delivery, tunneling, and processing costs. The impacts of several parameters on the mobility costs are then investigated.

To assure the Quality of Experience (QoE) for the users, an end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) management is required. While solutions for QoS management and admission control in access and core networks exist, the inclusion of the home network remains still open. Thus, we present a novel remote control architecture and method to arrange for admission control within home networks and on their access lines. Our method makes use of existing SIP-based infrastructures like IMS or dedicated subsystems by defining a new SIP-based signaling protocol for home network control, which we name HRCP (Home Resource Control Protocol). As a benefit, the subsystems?? capabilities for message routing, authentication, authorization and encryption can be re-used without the need to re-invent such methods again. In this paper we present an architecture based on ETSI TISPAN RACS along with message flows, results from a prototype implementation including the in-home QoS. Proof-of-concept is shown using a testbed with a small example service, namely an emergency service. Although our solution is presented within the scope of TISPAN RACS, it is applicable to any other type of remote session-based policy control system.	authentication;authorization;control system;end-to-end encryption;information management system (ims);internet protocol suite;next-generation network;prototype;quality of service;remote control;routing;signaling protocol;testbed	B.

dbd15f1607091ebe30dfbe2aeb5998825d40510b	enabling wireless voip		Carrier-grade mobile Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) requires capacity, voice quality, and delay characteristics that equal or exceed circuit-switched designs. One challenge for enabling mobile VoIP is dealing with packets delivered at irregular intervals. Traditional receivers convert this “jitter” into end-to-end delay and frame erasures, both of which are used to define system capacity. These state-of-the-art jitter buffers account for up to 40% of the delay budget as well as the vast majority of frame erasures. In this paper, a new paradigm is introduced where we apply signal processing techniques and psychological research to reduce this delay to zero, while greatly reducing the effects of frame erasures. We do so by introducing the concept of conversational delay, based on the observation that a user only perceives the delay of a few select voice packets. This is coupled with time scale modification and packet resynchronization to reduce delay, increase quality, and increase capacity. © 2007 Alcatel-Lucent.	channel capacity;circuit switching;end-to-end principle;network packet;programming paradigm;signal processing	Minkyu Lee;James W.

To do this, therefore, we focus on characteristics of the user's perceptual quality evaluation on 3-D objects. In this paper, we propose an effective QoS control scheme that introduces a relationship between system's internal quality parameters and user's perceptual quality parameters. This scheme can appropriately maintain quality and functions for users and is expected to drastically improve convenience when using 3DVE under the situation that resources are limited. Experimental results obtained from using a prototype of QuViE/P show effectiveness of our scheme as follows: Even when computer resource is reduced to 30% of the required amount, our proposed scheme can preferentially keep quality of important objects. Moreover it continues to provide quality and functions that user requires.

We explore the problem of enhancing MBMS resilience by repairing packets lost during broadcast. Since MBMS broadcast consumes expensive 3G resources, we leverage the ubiquity of multi-homed mobile devices i.e., devices having both cellular and IEEE 802.11 wireless interfaces. We thus accomplish out-of-band repair of MBMS packet losses through an ad-hoc, peer-to-peer 802.11-based network. A fundamental challenge in scheduling repair transmissions is handling interference between distributed nodes. We present DiCoR, a fully distributed protocol for CPR. Our protocol does not assume any a priori knowledge of the network topology or peer losses, and is resilient to dynamic network changes due to node mobility or the continuous joining and leaving of peers. Detailed simulation experiments, under realistic loss models and network conditions, demonstrate that DiCoR presents a viable solution for timely out-of-band loss repair of MBMS real-time broadcast.	converge;cyber resilience;data rate units;digital distribution;experiment;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);mobile device;mobile television;multihoming;multimedia broadcast multicast service;network packet;network topology;out-of-band agreement;peer-to-peer;playout;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);simulation	Saqib Raza;Gene Cheung;Chen-Nee Chuah	2008	2008 5th International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems	10.1109/BROADNETS.2008.4769094	wireless ad hoc network;out-of-band management;communications protocol;broadcast radiation;atomic broadcast;a priori and a posteriori;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;mobile device;distributed computing;packet loss;multimedia broadcast multicast service;scheduling;network topology;computer network	Mobile	-8.227477713988014	96.77069638277737	177266

This feature can contribute to robustness and scalability. However, it introduces network-oblivious traffic because of network-unaware peer selection. As P2P users have increased, so does the damage this problem causes. To solve this problem, various P2P model based on collaboration between ISP and P2P users have been recently suggested and then reduced network-oblivious traffic by removing biased peer selection. However, previous schemes have mainly focused on reducing traffic, which does improve network performance. In order to support effective real-time IPTV services, it should be required to not only reduce network-oblivious traffic, but it should also improve user performance such as delay and jitter because IPTV is an application sensitive to delay and jitter. In fact, the reduction of network-oblivious traffic improves user performance but it cannot always guarantee optimum performance experienced by real-time streaming service users. In this paper, we propose an ISP-driven managed P2P framework and peer selection mechanism for real-time IPTV user. For the evaluation, we use a QualNet 4.0 simulator and show proposed mechanism provides the performance effectively. Ultimately, we confirmed that ISPs should reflect the delay information of organized P2P network as well as the link traffic between each peer for effective real-time IPTV services.	iptv;real-time transcription	Seil Jeon;Younghan Kim;Jonghwa Yi;Shingak Kang	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04190-7_21	real-time computing;engineering;world wide web;computer network	Metrics	-8.180187045305392	98.40739515115521	177406

With the provided mathematical model, the video server prepares for receivers a lookup table, which lists all optimal combinations of video and FEC layers under various available downlink bandwidth and packet drop rates.

In three cases, Web traffic traces for a specific Web site were recorded at client-side to calculate above two metrics; meanwhile the user-perceived service qualities of the Web site were evaluated subjectively. Linear regress analysis of the observation data shows that user-perceived quality of Web application service can be objectively estimated by a linear regression function that uses the two metrics as independent variables.	client-side;coefficient;experiment;quality of service;service-level agreement;tracing (software);web application;web service;web traffic;world wide web	W.

The Network Mobility (NEMO) basic support protocol (B-NEMO) was introduced to provide Internet access for a group of users in a moving vehicle in an effective manner. As an extension of Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6), B-NEMO inherits the limitations from both the host-based and the centralized mobility management protocol such as sub-optimal routing (especially, in the nested NEMO scenario), reliability and scalability issues. Recently, Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) has been introduced as a new trend to overcome the limitations of the centralized mobility management protocols. However, DMM may not be a suitable scheme for moving vehicles since it faces several challenges such as complex address and tunnel management, high signaling cost, and long handover latency in case of users moving at a high speed. In this document, we propose a hybrid centralized-distributed mobility management architecture in the context of NEMO. Our solution allows the devices to obtain connectivity either from fixed locations or mobile platforms (e.g., a NEMO) and move between them, while keeping their on-going flows. The numerical results showed that the solution helps keeping the advantages of DMM approach in terms of signaling cost, packet delivery cost, handover latency, and end-to-end delay even in the moving vehicle scenario.	centralized computing;denial-of-service attack;digital molecular matter (dmm);end-to-end encryption;experiment;internet access;mobile ip;mobile device;network packet;numerical analysis;proxy mobile ipv6;routing;scalability;testbed	Tien-Thinh Nguyen;Christian Bonnet	2015	2015 IEEE 16th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)	10.1109/WoWMoM.2015.7158125	telecommunications;computer science;manganese;operating system;mobility model;mobile computing;computer security;mobile ip;computer network	Mobile	-11.803747136432639	89.7922435558385	177723

In this paper, we study HAP as an alternative or complementary fast-evolving technology to provide mobile services in rural areas of emerging countries, where business models need to be carefully tailored to the reality of their related markets. In these large areas with low user density, mobile services uptake is likely to be slowed by a service profitability which is in turn limited by a relatively low average revenue per user. Through three architectures enabling different business roles and using different terrestrial, HAP and satellite backhaul solutions, we devise how to use in an efficient and profitable fashion these multi-purpose aerial platforms, in complement to existing access and backhauling satellite or terrestrial technologies.	aerial photography;backhaul (telecommunications);controlled grammar;mnos;multi-purpose viewer;requirement;software deployment;terrestrial television	Laurent Reynaud;Salim Zaïmi;Yvon Gourhant	2011	2011 15th International Conference on Intelligence in Next Generation Networks	10.1109/ICIN.2011.6081095	business model;embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	-17.74459070114495	93.81724189423481	178150

RT applications such as voice and video are delay and delay variation sensitive, i.e., in case the packets incur large delays and delay variation, the quality of the application is severely degraded (e.g., the video is choppy and the voice is not clear). Successful launching of RT applications necessitates end-to-end QoS guarantees in terms of bandwidth, bounded delays and delay jitter. Q-Soft is independent of the network interface card and of the multimedia applications we run. The experimental results of our solution were obtained on a PC-Windows-based testbed consisting of a home network (wired or wireless) connected to the Internet via a residential gateway. The experimental results we have obtained provide evidence that our solution provides QoS service support for multimedia applications.	quality of service;software framework	Aura Ganz;Kitti Wongthavarawat;Anan Phonphoem	2003	Computer Networks	10.1016/S1389-1286(02)00368-7	embedded system;real-time computing;mobile qos;quality of service;computer science;software framework;operating system;network interface controller;residential gateway;wireless;computer network	Arch	-7.468258807881165	95.41438797442179	178228
384b69a7056c18d4a6a25ab60de4365a067a220d	cooperative internet access in resource constrained environments	doctoralthesis	Access to the Internet has become available at virtually any place in developed and developing countries, either by fixed-line or wireless access. The Internet users are used to check emails, read web pages, or see a video at any time via the Internet and are annoyed if the access does not work or does work but too slowly for the used application. The access to the Internet is stable and fast enough in metro areas, but even in these area the access network is just too slow under certain circumstances. In many other situations, such as in rural areas or while being on the move, the network capacity is usually not sufficient to keep up with the capacity demand of the applications used by the users. The easiest conclusion in cases where the network access is too slow for a specific application is simply: give up. Another approach is to call for an upgrade of the network to offer more capacity, but this is not as easy, as this involves the network operator to do the upgrade. We call such a situation where the Internet access is too slow a resource constrained environment. This thesis presents throughput measurements of such an environment for 2 UMTS-based mobile wireless networks to show the limits of a real deployments. However, typically there is not a single user in an area with such a limited Internet access, but multiple users with their Internet terminal. We use the possibility of having multiple users in the same area to let them cooperatively retrieve data from the Internet. The scheme we introduce allows a group of users in physical proximity to jointly access a resource or resources, by efficiently using the Internet access ressources each user contributes to the group, with the goal to overcome a resource constrained environment of each single host. The basic idea is: use several (fixed-line or wireless) Internet access links at the same time and distribute the data retrieval load among them (“application layer channel bonding”). This assumes the presence of a 2nd high-bandwidth local network (e. g., WLAN in ad-hoc mode) which allows content redistribution between these users free of charge. The framework we are proposing is called Cooperative Internet Access and is defined on the conceptual level in this thesis and elaborated with 2 applications using the frame work.

The motivations of service providers for designing converged interactive multimedia services, which are crafted for their individual requirements, are investigated. The overall design of the system is presented with particular emphasis placed on the operational features of each of the sub-systems, the flows of media and metadata through the sub-systems and the formats and protocols required for inter-communication between them. The key features of tools required for creating converged interactive multimedia content for a range of different end-user terminal types are examined. Finally possible enhancements to this system are discussed. This study is of particular interest to those organizations currently conducting trials and commercial launches of DVB-H services because it provides them with an insight of the various additional functions required in the service provisioning platforms to provide fully interactive services to a range of different mobile terminal types	business requirements;dvb-h;mobile phone;mobile television;personalization;provisioning;requirement;terrestrial television;user interface	Fabio Allamandri;Sebastien Campion;Angelo Centonza;Alex Chernilov;John Cosmas;Annette Duffy;David Garrec;Michel Guiraudou;Kannan Krishnapillai;Thierry Levesque;Bertrand Mazieres;Ronald Mies;Thomas J.

Over this period of time our simulation capability has improved significantly due to the efforts of the simulation research community. There has also been significant progress over the years by the networking research community in understanding the use of simulation in the design and evaluation of network architectures, protocols and services. I will argue in this talk that, despite these advances, we still do not have an acceptable and widely-used methodology to simulate networks which often leads to the questioning of the credibility of simulation results. This can be attributed to many reasons, including 1) confusion and uncertainty within the networking community regarding the role that simulation plays in networking research, 2) fundamental limits that make it basically impossible to simulate Internet-scale networks, 3) the difficulty in building realistic network models and 4) the lack of acceptable standards for validity and repeatability of simulation experiments. I will suggest a high-level research agenda that addresses these issues with the ultimate aim of enriching the networking research community's ability to use simulation as a meaningful tool for performance evaluation and prediction.	experiment;high- and low-level;performance evaluation;repeatability;simulation;telecommunications network	Mostafa H.

13c52c09f897ae95805dbe9ad1222b893e7af388	a tool for multimedia quality assessment in ns3: qoe monitor	psnr;qoe evaluation;ssim;ns 3	Nowadays, with the continuous rise of Internet-based multimedia services, such as video sharing websites, web radios and IP-based telephony, multimedia communications are gaining more and more popularity. From the service provider's perspective, there is an increasing need in providing high-quality content; at the same time, from the network provider's view, the requirement is to design networks that can e ectively support these services with adequate quality-of-service (QoS). In both cases, engineers and researchers need suitable planning tools exploitable for providing appropriate designs. For all these reasons, we have focused our work on the design and implementation of a novel open-source tool, named QoE Monitor, which consists of a new module for the NS-3 simulator that can be used to perform quality-of-experience (QoE) assessments in any simulated network. The goal of this tool is to predict the video and/or audio quality perceived by an end user through objective metrics. Moreover, its open-source nature foster its validation and promote knowledge sharing within the research community, while its modularity eases the implementation of additional software components to expand its capabilities (e.g., to account for new codecs and/or new QoE metrics). In this paper, a detailed description of this tool is done and some numerical results about video streaming performance evaluations are presented, which show its e ectiveness for the QoE analysis.	codec;component-based software engineering;computer monitor;display resolution;future internet;internet protocol suite;numerical analysis;open-source software;performance evaluation;quality of service;simulation;streaming media;working set	Daniela Saladino;Alessandro Paganelli;Maurizio Casoni	2013	Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory	10.1016/j.simpat.2012.11.011	simulation;peak signal-to-noise ratio;computer science;structural similarity;multimedia;world wide web;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-9.598297483622394	100.4603029086521	178805

It is an important and challenging issue to support seamless handoff management in this integrated architecture. The existing handoff management protocols are not sufficient to guarantee handoff support that is transparent to the applications in NGWS. In this work, a cross-layer (layer 2 + 3) handoff management protocol, CHMP, is developed to support seamless intra and intersystem handoff management in NGWS. Cross-layer handoff management protocol uses mobile's speed and handoff signaling delay information to enhance the handoff performance of mobile IP that is proposed to support mobility management in wireless IP networks. First, the handoff performance of mobile IP is analyzed with respect to its sensitivity to the link layer (layer 2) and network layer (layer 3) parameters. Then, a cross-layer handoff management architecture is developed using the insights learnt from the analysis. Based on this architecture, the detailed design of CHMP is carried out. Finally, extensive simulation experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of CHMP. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that CHMP significantly enhances the performance of both intra and intersystem handoffs	.net framework;communications protocol;experiment;internet protocol suite;mobile ip;rss;seamless3d;simulation	Shantidev Mohanty;Ian F.

In the study, forty participants were asked to choose the lowest quality video that would still provide for a comfortable and long-term viewing experience, knowing that higher video quality is more expensive and bandwidth intensive. This paper proposes the lowest pleasing bitrates and corresponding encoding parameters for five different content types: cartoon, movie, music, news and sports. It also explores how the lowest pleasing quality is influenced by content type, image resolution, bitrate, and user gender, prior viewing experience, and preference. In addition, it analyzes the trajectory of users' progression while selecting the lowest pleasing quality. The findings reveal that the lowest bitrate requirement for a pleasing viewing experience is much higher than that of the lowest acceptable quality. Users' criteria for the lowest pleasing video quality are related to the video's content features, as well as its usage purpose and the user's personal preferences. These findings can provide video providers guidance on what quality they should offer to please mobile users.	color gradient;image resolution;video	Wei Song;Dian Tjondronegoro;Michael J.

For example, carriers want to offer mobile Internet services as fast as those provided by cable- and DSL-based wireline broadband technologies. This process has taken the industry through various generations of radio-based wireless service: After first-generation (1G) analog cellular service, they have offered 2G, 2.5G, and, since 2001, 3G digital technology. As carriers upgrade their 3G offerings, they are looking perhaps five years ahead to 4G services, which would be based on the Internet Protocol and support mobile transmission rates of 100 Mbps and fixed rates of 1 Gbps. Presently the subject of extensive research, 4G would enable such currently unavailable services as mobile high-definition TV and gaming, as well as teleconferencing.	data rate units;digital electronics;digital subscriber line;hdmi;internet access;web service	George Lawton	2005	Computer	10.1109/MC.2005.207	code division multiple access;mobile qos;telecommunications;computer science;services computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-18.29532198728134	93.7231669100697	179125

For that reason, we aim at designing an interreceiver delay jitter fair service for Internet multicast delivery. In contrast to related work, we present an approach at application layer, which does not assume special properties of the core network nodes and can be partially deployed. All necessary functions except a trusted time service are handled in the end systems. At the receivers, a secure hardware performs the security related functions. Additionally, the approach implicitly takes current network load into account, which gives the opportunity to keep the message delivery delay low. An analysis and simulation of the approach shows that the resulting inter-receiver delay jitter can be reduced to the order of tens of milliseconds.	authentication;fairness measure;internet;java;multicast;osi model;packet delay variation;simulation;smart card;software deployment	Jens-Uwe Klöcking;Christian Maihöfer;Kurt Rothermel	2001		10.1109/ICCCN.2001.956225	media delivery index;embedded system;smart card;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer network	Metrics	-8.869073170939268	91.18912698174965	179150

This paper focuses on medium access control (MAC) alternatives that can find application in an LMDS/LMCS network capable of supporting multimedia traffic. Multifrequency demand assignment TDMA-based schemes appear (at the moment) to be a suitable choice in this context. The selected protocol should be dynamically capable of providing multirate capabilities and quality-of-service guarantees. An obvious candidate for the aforementioned purpose is the LMDS-specific MAC proposal in the DAVIC 1.2 recommendation. For purposes of comparison, we also examine the evolving IEEE 802.14 MAC convergence protocol and MCNS (multimedia cable network system) DOCSIS (ITU J-112) MAC standard that are intended to support similar applications and services in an HFC (hybrid fiber coax) environment. The three protocols are examined under noiseless and noisy channel conditions. Previous results on LMDS channel characteristics are summarized and used for modeling noisy channel conditions. The candidate protocols are compared in terms of mean access delay, throughput, and collision multiplicity statistics, when contention of users is involved. The effect of dynamic slot allocation on the performance of the candidate protocols is also examined.	atm turbo;access control;block cipher mode of operation;cable modem;channel (communications);hybrid fibre-coaxial;list of sequence alignment software;noisy-channel coding theorem;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;piggybacking (internet access);quality of service;simulation;software deployment;software propagation;throughput;www;wireless access point	M.

This work analyses the quality of experience of HSDPA users, based on experiments and measurements over a commercial network. The effect of multiple users sharing the overall capacity of the cell is explicitly evaluated. The results show that the HSDPA user experience for Internet access is satisfactory and in some cases comparable to that achievable over fixed access technologies such as ADSL. In addition, we explore the impact of TCP configuration on the HSDPA performance and suggest suitable parameter values.	asymmetric digital subscriber line;experiment;fixed access;internet access;multi-user;telecommunications link;throughput;user experience	Manuel Alvarez-Campana;Enrique Vázquez;Joan Vinyes	2008		10.1007/978-0-387-84839-6_18	user experience design;internet access;telecommunications;computer science;multimedia;computer network	Mobile	-7.242317799486251	92.20577976946961	179354
0c7b69721e52250700b9a70cc3615b09523352cb	concurrent wi-fi for mobile users: analysis and measurements	mobile user	We present the first in-depth analysis of the performance of attempting concurrent AP connections from highly mobile clients. Previous solutions for concurrent Wi-Fi are limited to stationary wireless clients and do not take into account a myriad of mobile factors. Through an analytical model, optimization framework, and numerous outdoor experiments, we show that connection duration, AP response times, channel scheduling, available and offered bandwidth, node speed, and dhcp joins all affect performance. Building on these results, we design, implement, and evaluate a system, Spider, that establishes and maintains concurrent connections to 802.11 APs in a mobile environment. The system uses multi-AP selection, channel-based scheduling, and opportunistic scanning to maximize throughput while mitigating the overhead of association and dhcp. While Spider can manage multiple channels, we empirically demonstrate that it achieves maximum throughput when using multiple APs on a single channel. Our evaluation shows that Spider provides a 400% improvement in throughput and 54% improvement in connectivity over stock Wi-Fi implementations.	experiment;mathematical optimization;maximum throughput scheduling;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);stationary process	Hamed Soroush;Peter Gilbert;Nilanjan Banerjee;Brian Neil Levine;Mark D.

We envisage such move within the paradigm of Functionality as a Service (FaaS); a platform that can also deliver requirements of the 5th generation mobile, i.e. 5G. In this paper, we briefly explain architectural elements of mobile networks that can materialize the FaaS platform, and discuss the mobility management within the FaaS platform. Relying on these architectural elements, we propose modelling the dynamics of mobile network topology, including fixed base stations and mobile users, as a self-regulatory network. Therefore, users' mobility is provisioned and traffic flow is moved to the next point of attachment, i.e. the next base station, with no handover request from the mobile device. Clearly, there is a trade-off between keeping the abstract model up-to-date and the increased overhead of the updates. Hence, we further examine the effect of such out-of-date and insufficient information in the abstraction. The investigations are carried out in network simulator (ns-3) and it can be seen while reducing frequency of updates results in the increased packet loss, an optimal balance between overhead and packet loss can be achieved.	attachments;control plane;coupling (computer programming);mobile device;network packet;network topology;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;requirement;serverless computing	Albert Codes Morales;Adnan Aijaz;Toktam Mahmoodi	2015	2015 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2015.7414151	radio access network;embedded system;cellular network;mobile identification number;mobile search;public land mobile network;telecommunications;computer science;handover;operating system;mobile station;mobility model;mobile computing;network topology;computer network	Mobile	-13.357796004138049	89.57326988399608	179691

In recent years, there has been interest in extending the MPLS capability to wireless access networks for mobility management support. In this paper, we present analysis of Micro Mobile MPLS, a new micro-mobility management scheme which integrates the Mobile IP and MPLS protocols by using two-level hierarchy architecture. Our proposal supports two protocol variants. First, the fast handoff process, which anticipates the LSP procedure set-up with neighboring locations where a mobile node (MN) may move to, is provided to reduce service disruption. Second, a new mechanism based on the forwarding chain concept is proposed to track efficiently the host mobility within a domain. This concept can significantly reduce registration update costs and provide low handoff latency. Analytical models are developed and simulations are conducted to justify the benefits of our proposed mechanisms.		Rami Langar;Samir Tohmé;Nizar Bouabdallah	2006	Int.

The rate adaptation of HAS has been designed to make a trade-off between two contrasting requirements, i.e., enhancing the quality of a video, and reducing the probability of video freezes, by adaptively switching between different video bitrates during a video playback session. This process becomes more challenging when moving onto an long term evolution (LTE) cellular network due to the unstable nature of the wireless channel. In this paper, we propose the bandwidth variation pattern-differentiated rate adaptation (BVPDRA) algorithm for LTE cellular networks. Unlike prior works, BVPDRA does not strike a balance between the stableness and responsiveness of bitrate switching in the case of bandwidth capacity variations. BVPDRA differentiates between bandwidth variation patterns of the LTE cellular network as either constant bandwidth fluctuations or instantaneous bandwidth hopping. Accordingly, BVPDRA operates with a dual character: for the constant bandwidth fluctuations, BVPDRA performs smoothed bandwidth prediction and conservative rate switching to minimize video quality version oscillations; for the instantaneous bandwidth hopping, BVPDRA performs positive bandwidth prediction and aggressive rate switching to maximize the bandwidth utilization and minimize the risk of playback stalling. We empirically evaluate the performance of BVPDRA on an LTE cellular network testbed. The results demonstrate that BVPDRA achieves a higher average bitrate, and lower rebuffering ratio with a reduced bitrate switching frequency.	algorithm;clock rate;compaq lte;control theory;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hypertext transfer protocol;requirement;responsiveness;smoothing;streaming media;testbed	Haipeng Du;Qinghua Zheng;Weizhan Zhang;Xiang Gao	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2788057	computer network;switching frequency;wireless;computer science;average bitrate;testbed;video quality;bandwidth (signal processing);communication channel;cellular network	Mobile	-7.565891608207649	98.40932953278315	180465

Practical approaches for the estimation of bandwidth needs rely on rough traffic measurements overlooking traffic fluctuations that may have a negative impact on the network performance. On the other hand, effective theoretical solutions for estimating bandwidth needs require traffic measurements at very small timescales, which limit their applicability due to, for example, transmission rates. This paper describes our research goal of proposing a reliable and scalable solution for estimating bandwidth requirements by means of flow-level traffic measurements, as well as our proposed approach to achieve it. This research, currently in its initial phase, is planned to result in a Ph.D. thesis at the end of four years.	bandwidth (signal processing);network performance;provisioning;requirement;scalability	Ricardo de Oliveira Schmidt;Aiko Pras	2011			bandwidth management;network traffic control;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;network performance;traffic shaping;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Metrics	-4.632295121369461	96.52159032853403	180468

These applications usually involve the transmission of massive amounts of digital video data, which requires the application of video image compression technology, under a stringent timing constraint. As a result, the transmission of the variable bit rate (VBR) trac generated by the compression algorithms plays a very important role in meeting the real-time requirement of the applications. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of the real-time trac generated by Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG), which is one of the most notable video image compression standards, and evaluate four dierent transmission schemes for the real-time VBR trac. In order to have a deterministic behavior and bounded message delays, we choose the timed token medium access control (MAC) protocol for the evaluation of our transmission schemes. Judging from our maximum bandwidth demand analysis, and after a series of intensive simulation experiments, the results reveal that in our best scenario, the performance improvement (PI) can be as high as 422% over the original default transmission scheme in terms of the number of video streams that can be supported in the network.

Conflicts often arise among the various video streams on these communication channels when the available bandwidth is limited because the bitrates and transmission range required often vary. This study proposes a server-side-based rate allocation algorithm for content delivery networks (CDNs). Instead of simply considering bitrate selection from the perspective of network and client conditions, the algorithm combines user experience with video bitrate allocation to maximize viewer engagement. First, the values of users are evaluated and a user value computation method is proposed. Second, we developed a profit maximization bitrate allocation approach (PMBAA) that enables both content providers and CDNs to maximize profits by providing guaranteed video quality. At last, the results of test bed experiments and analyses verify that PMBAA enables high-value clients to obtain more preferable bitrates than the HTTP live streaming algorithm developed by Apple Inc.	client-side;computation;content delivery network;digital distribution;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;http live streaming;hypertext transfer protocol;multi-user;server (computing);server-side;streaming algorithm;streaming media;testbed;user experience	Dongyan Zhang;Hui He;Weihua Li	2016	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-016-0919-7	throughput;real-time computing;computer science;multimedia;variable bitrate;constant bitrate;computer network	Mobile	-8.875767093663244	98.53665846067481	180854

Burst assembly time at the ingress node is known to affect the traffic characteristics and loss distribution in the core network. We propose an algorithm for adapting the burst assembly time based on the observed loss pattern in the network. The proposed Learning-based Burst Assembly (LBA) algorithm uses learning automata which probe the loss in the network periodically and change the assembly time at the ingress node to a favorable one. We use a discrete set of values for the burst assembly time that can be selected and assign a probability to each of them. The probability of selecting an assembly time is updated depending on the loss measured over the path using a Linear Reward-Penalty (LR−P ) scheme. The convergence of these probabilities eventually leads to the selection of an optimal burst assembly time that minimizes the burst loss probability (BLP) for any given traffic pattern. We present simulation results for different types of traffic and two network topologies to demonstrate that LBA achieves lower BLP compared to the fixed and adaptive burst assembly mechanisms existing in the literature.	aap;algorithm;automata theory;automaton;autonomic computing;internet;learning automata;network topology;optical burst switching;simulation;throughput;x86 assembly language	T.

We examine player behavior in terms of when, how much, and what they do in the virtual world. Player behavior is described through previously defined action categories for MMORPGs (Trading, Questing, Dungeons, Raiding, and Player versus Player (PvP) Combat) with addition of a new category for text and voice communication within a session. We conduct a player survey and perform measurements on the client side for a group of 104 players of a popular MMORPG - World of Warcraft (WoW), and discover that there are significant patterns in player behavior. Additionally we examine the importance of both voice and textual (chat) communication in MMORPGs, and note that communication makes a significant portion of average player's playtime and that voice communication is used by a large portion of players. We believe that the results of this study may be used for improving the existing and design of new MMORPGs (e.g., building better load balancing algorithms, addition of content that is more interesting for players) with more emphasis on both old and new communication aspects of the game (e.g., inbuilt voice clients, new ways of connecting the players). This work also serves as a starting point for better insight into networking requirements for such applications, which may be useful for service and network providers.	add-ons for firefox;algorithm;categorization;client-side;display resolution;keystroke logging;load balancing (computing);massively multiplayer online role-playing game;network traffic control;online chat;requirement;slash (cms);vii;virtual world;winsock;world of warcraft	Mirko Suznjevic;Ognjen Dobrijevic;Maja Matijasevic	2009	2009 8th Annual Workshop on Network and Systems Support for Games (NetGames)	10.1109/NETGAMES.2009.5446235	simulation;computer science;load balancing;operating system;distributed computing;virtual reality;multimedia;computer security;computer network	HCI	-13.37950087923852	99.30159928357918	181086

IPTV usually means distribution of television or video content over a controlled IP network, where the end consumer receives the information through a set-top box which is connected to its normal broadband connection. Just because its name is IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) it does not mean that information is sent over the internet, only that IP protocol is used. So we should not consider streaming video over the internet as IPTV. Many of the world's major telecommunications providers are exploring IPTV as a new revenue opportunity from their existing markets and as a defensive measure against encroachment from more conventional Cable Television services. Also, there is a growing number of IPTV installations within schools, universities, corporations and local institutions. Will the content of IPTV be different from that of the traditional video delivery systems of broadcast television, video recordings, cable television and satellite television? How are the new IPTV business structured? What new modes of intermediation are replacing older forms in this market? Are things moving away from a mass audience model for high end television toward a more niche oriented approach? These are some of the questions that we have tried to answer in this paper. We have also given an insight to the hope of IPTV in Indian market.	digital video;iptv;internet;niche blogging;set-top box;streaming media;terrestrial television	N.

While subjective QoE methods would better reflect the nature of human perception, these are not suitable in real-time automation cases. On the other hand, the existing objective algorithms are either too complex or too inaccurate, particularly in the context of lightweight devices such as camera sensors or smart phones. This paper introduces a novel objective QoE algorithm, Instantaneous Video Quality Assessment (IVQA), that is comparably as accurate as the most heavyweight algorithm available in the literature but can also be run in real-time. This approach is tested against a selection of ten objective metrics and benchmarked with a subjective user dataset.	algorithm;real-time clock;real-time transcription;sensor;smartphone	Antonio Liotta;Decebal Constantin Mocanu;Vlado Menkovski;Luciana Cagnetta;Georgios Exarchakos	2013		10.1145/2536853.2536903	subjective video quality;simulation;video quality;multimedia	HCI	-9.549098915255815	100.37844816014135	181446

The analysis covers applications with a variety of statefulness levels. The study emphasizes the data cache behavior. Nevertheless, we also discuss other issues, such as branch prediction and ILP. Additionally, we analyze the architectural impact through the TCP connection life. Our results show an important memory bottleneck due to maintaining the states. Moreover, depending on the target of the application, the memory bottleneck may be concentrated within a set of packets or distributed along the TCP connection lifetime."""	branch predictor;edge device;end-to-end principle;internet;network packet;state (computer science);stateful firewall;von neumann architecture	Javier Verdú;Jorge García-Vidal;Mario Nemirovsky;Mateo Valero	2005	2005 Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS)	10.1145/1095890.1095893	real-time computing;flow;computer science;information security;operating system;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-7.991967753468387	88.7855606501162	182055

Indeed, H.263 and MPEG-4 video bitstreams can exhibit high peak rates and frequent rate variations, which are difficult to support in 2.5G and 3G mobile networks. In this paper, we consider smoothing schemes to minimize the peak rate, variance, and average bandwidth of the transmitted signal, in order to obtain a lower bit-error-rate and thus, a higher received video quality than if unsmoothed video were transmitted. By introducing a delay in the decoding process, the video output stream can be buffered at the video decoder end: this buffering capability is used in order to perform real-time smoothing of the video streams. The transmitter chooses among the set of rates provided by the IS-95B or cdma2000 standards, in a mobility scenario, in order to support the rate variations. We simulate two end-to-end video communication systems based on IS-95B and cdma2000. They consist of an H.263 codec, an H.223 multiplexer, a rate management system and the physical layer components of the IS-95B and cdma2000 standards. The transmitted signal is subject to multipath fading and multiple-access interference, obtained by simulating all the other users in the cell. Results show a significant gain in the video quality obtained through smoothing of the video streams.	algorithm;bit error rate;circuit switching;codec;data compression;end system;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;heart rate variability;interference (communication);multipath propagation;multiplexer;real-time clock;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;smoothing;streaming media;telecommunications link;transmitter;video decoder;volume boot record	Cyril-Daniel Iskander;P.

However, the vast majority of capacity measurement tools are based on active probing, which is not suitable for large scale studies of Internet paths characteristics. In this paper we present PPrate, a completely passive tool, that can extract capacity information of a path from the packet trace of a TCP connection. We validate PPrate using synthetic traces and real traces collected on PlanetLab. We compare PPrate with Pathrate, which is very accurate active tool, and show that they perform comparably. We finally apply PPrate on a large publicly available ADSL trace.	asymmetric digital subscriber line;network packet;planetlab;synthetic intelligence;tracing (software)	Taoufik En-Najjary;Guillaume Urvoy-Keller	2006	2006 4th IEEE/IFIP Workshop on End-to-End Monitoring Techniques and Services	10.1109/E2EMON.2006.1651283	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	Metrics	-6.326290695663951	90.63176520060689	182164

Despite defining quality of service (QoS) signalling mechanisms for interoperability between devices, IEEE 802.15.3 does not specify resource allocation algorithms that are left to manufacturers. To guarantee the QoS of real-time variable bit rate (VBR) videos and utilise the radio resource efficiently, the authors propose a dynamic resource allocation algorithm. The proposed bandwidth allocation algorithm is based on a novel traffic predictor. Recently, the variable step-size normalised least mean square (VSSNLMS) algorithm was employed for on-line traffic prediction of VBR videos. However, the performance of the VSSNLMS algorithm significantly degrades due to the abrupt traffic variation occurring at the scene boundary. To tackle this problem, the authors design a novel traffic predictor based on a simple scene detection algorithm and the VSSNLMS algorithm. Analyses using real-life MPEG video traces indicate that the proposed traffic predictor significantly outperforms the VSSNLMS algorithm with respect to the prediction error. The performance of the proposed bandwidth allocation algorithm is also investigated by comparing several existing algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed bandwidth allocation algorithm surpasses other mechanisms in terms of channel utilisation, buffer usage and packet loss rate.	access control;algorithm;interoperability;kerrison predictor;mean squared error;memory management;moving picture experts group;network packet;online and offline;quality of service;real life;real-time transcription;simulation;tracing (software);volume boot record	Wen-Kuang Kuo;Shao-Yu Lien	2009	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com:20080015	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Embedded	-5.791675937980214	101.07557334609595	182313

Regardless of the error-control method adopted by the application, unacknowledged or missing packets must be quickly identified as lost or delayed, so that necessary timely actions can be taken by the server/client. Historically, this problem has been referred to as the retransmission timeout (RTO) estimation. Earlier studies show that existing RTO estimators suffer from either long loss detection times or a large number of pre-mature timeouts. The goal of this study is to address these problems by developing an adaptive RTO estimator for high-bitrate low-delay video applications. By exploiting the temporal dependence between consecutive delay samples, we propose an adaptive linear delay predictor. This way, our RTO estimator configures itself based on the video characteristics and varying network conditions. Our approach also features a controller that optimally manages the trade-off between the amount of overwaiting and redundant retransmission rate. The skeleton implementation shows that the proposed RTO estimator discriminates lost packets from excessively-delayed packets faster and more accurately than its rivals, which consequently enables the applications to recover more packets under stringent delay requirements.	kerrison predictor;recovery time objective;requirement;retransmission (data networks);server (computing);timeout (computing)	Ali C.

However, most current techniques were designed for wired networks and produce relatively inaccurate results and long convergence times on wireless networks where capacity can vary dramatically. This paper presents a new wireless bandwidth estimation tool, WBest, designed for fast, non-intrusive, accurate estimation of available bandwidth in IEEE 802.11 networks. WBest is a two-stage algorithm: 1) a packet pair technique estimates the effective capacity over a flow path where the last hop is a wireless LAN (WLAN); and 2) a packet train technique estimates achievable throughput to infer the available bandwidth. WBest parameters are optimized given the tradeoffs of accuracy, intrusiveness and convergence time. The advantage of WBest stems from avoiding a search algorithm to detect the available bandwidth by statistically detecting the available fraction of the effective capacity to mitigate estimation delay and the impact of random wireless channel errors. WBest is implemented and evaluated on an 802.11 wireless testbed. Comparisons with other available bandwidth estimation tools shows WBest to have higher accuracy, lower intrusiveness and faster convergence times. Thus, WBest demonstrates the potential for improving the performance of applications that need bandwidth estimation, such as multimedia streaming, on wireless networks.	bandwidth management;experiment;image scaling;mathematical optimization;network packet;playout;search algorithm;sensor;streaming media;testbed;throughput	Mingzhe Li;Mark Claypool;Robert E.

Many companies have deployed their own CDN-and so demonstrating the resulting effectiveness. However, many aspects of deployment and implementation remain proprietary, evidencing the lack of a general CDN model to help the research community analyze different working scenarios. In this paper, we propose a general expression for a content distribution environment and study the performance impact of design variables such as caching hit ratios, network latency, number of surrogates, and server capacity.

Existing location services use node identifiers to determine the locator (aka anchor) that is responsible for keeping track of a node's location. Such a strategy can be inefficient because: (i) identifiers give no clue on the node's mobility and (ii) locators can be far from the destination thus increasing location updates path length and bandwidth consumption. To solve these issues, Otiy introduces a new strategy that identifies nodes to play the role of locators based on the likelihood of a destination to be close to these nodes -- i.e., locators are identified depending on the mobility pattern of nodes. Otiy relies on the cyclic mobility patterns of nodes and creates a slotted agenda composed of a set of predicted locations, defined according to the past and present patterns of mobility. Correspondent nodes fetch this agenda and use it as a reference for identifying which locator is currenty in charge for the node. Over a period of about one year, the weekly proportion of nodes having at least 50% of exact location predictions is in average about 75%. This proportion increases by 10% when nodes also consider their closeness to the locator from only what they know about the network. In this paper we focus on the analysis of the concepts behind Otiy leaving more quantitative and comparative results for future work.	anytime algorithm;centrality;cluster analysis;identifier;location-based service;mesh networking;online locator service;overhead (computing);ping-pong scheme;software propagation;testbed;tracing (software);wireless mesh network	Michael Mathias Boc;Anne Fladenmuller;Marcelo Dias de Amorim	2007		10.1145/1364654.1364672	wireless mesh network;routing;addressing mode;telecommunications;computer science;lisp;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-10.262570137283808	88.81600327934053	184657

The paper describes the design and overall architecture of a regenerative IDVB-T infrastructure, where content adaptation processes are performed following either a centralized or a distributed approach, setting the basis for a real time accommodation of IPTV services to the available network resources (i.e. bandwidth) and capabilities of End Users terminals (i.e. processing power, screen resolution, codec support). Validity of both Content Adaptation approaches is experimentally verified, with the initial test-results indicating similar performance.	centralized computing;codec;content adaptation;digital video broadcasting;display resolution;experiment;iptv	Anargyros Sideris;Evangelos K.

The small, mobile nature o f these devices results in a unique mix of network usage. Other studies have used Wi-F i and 3G wireless traces to analyze session, mobility, and performance chara teristics for handheld devices. We complement these studies through our unique stu dy of the differences in the content and flow characteristics of handheld versus no n-handheld traffic. We analyze packet traces from two separate campus wireless n etworks, with 3 days of traffic for 32,278 unique devices. Trends for handhel ds include low UDP usage, high volumes of HTTP traffic, and a greater proportion of video traffic. Our observations can inform network management and mobile s yst m design.	data rate units;handheld game console;hypertext transfer protocol;mobile device;network packet;network planning and design;network security;quality of service;stu-i;smartphone;systems design;tracing (software);web service	Aaron Gember;Ashok Anand;Aditya Akella	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-19260-9_18	computer science;operating system;wireless network;mobile device;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-16.619136288194504	89.63937105942013	185093

Knowing the network services and conditions available at each one becomes crucial. In order to store information from several networks and operators, the new IEEE 802.21 standard specifies a Media Independent Information Service (MIIS) supporting various information elements (IEs) that provide network information within a geographical area, with the aim of optimising the handover process. Since next-generation wireless devices are expected to support multiple radio access networks, users will be able to maintain connections when switching from one network to another. This article addresses a general approach towards the deployment of a Hierarchical 802.21 Information Service management infrastructure in a heterogeneous mobile environment. Through an NS-2-based simulation, it is shown that the proposed scheme improves the user experience in terms of MIIS server access time and number of optimal handovers in a random mobility scenario.	access network;access time;geographic coordinate system;internet;mii;server (computing);simulation;software deployment;user experience	Fábio Buiati;L.

These algorithms have a number of applications in real-time wireless LAN management, for instance, in detecting unauthorized access points and detecting/predicting performance degradations. Both algorithms use sequential hypothesis tests and exploit fundamental properties of the 802.11 CSMA/CA MAC protocol and the half-duplex nature of wireless channels. They differ in that one requires training sets, while the other does not. We have built a system for online wireless traffic detection using these algorithms and deployed it at a university gateway router. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach: the algorithm that requires training provides rapid detection and is extremely accurate (the detection is mostly within 10 seconds, with very low false-positive and false-negative ratios), the algorithm that does not require training detects 60 percent to 76 percent of the wireless hosts without any false positives, and both algorithms are lightweight, with computation and storage overhead well within the capability of commodity equipment.	acknowledgement (data networks);authorization;computation;duplex (telecommunications);experiment;network packet;online algorithm;overhead (computing);real-time clock;router (computing);sensor;wireless access point	Wei Wei;Kyoungwon Suh;Bing Wang;Yu Gu;James F.

Among existing options, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) as a network-based protocol presents higher handover performance comparing with its client-based counterparts such as Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) and Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6). Nevertheless, the PMIPv6's operation is limited to a relatively small domain. This motivated researchers to try to extend PMIPv6 operation beyond its local mobility domain, while preserving its network-based nature. However, the existing globally extended PMIPv6 solutions experience longer handover latency and higher packet loss comparing to the original PMIPv6. This paper suggests a low-latency global PMIPv6 scheme, which creates the mobile node's binding record inside the target domain before its real attachment to that domain. The proposed scheme takes advantage of link layer events to initiate IP-level handover in parallel with link reconnection process. The analytical and simulation-base evaluations demonstrate the enhanced performance of the proposed scheme concerning to the handover latency and packet loss.	attachments;experiment;inter-domain;mobile ip;mobile phone;network packet;proxy mobile ipv6;simulation;subnetwork	Alireza Taghizadeh;T.

In a GEO environment, the delay in the delivery of a message is very high, the Round Trip Time (RTT) is above 500ms. These characteristics heavily affect the acknowledgement mechanism on which the TCP is based and the performance of the protocol is much lower than in cable networks. The paper proposes and analyses possible solutions aimed at mitigating the negative effect and at improving the performance. A real test-bed is used to carry out the study: two remote hosts are connected together through a satellite link in the Ka-band (20-30GHz) by using IP routers. The system has been tested by using a ftp-like application, that allows transferring data of variable size between the two hosts. This is due to the observation that most of the Internet multimedia applications, as browsing and distance learning, use massive file transfer. The protocol behavior is investigated both by tuning the parameters buffer size and initial congestion window and by modifying the dynamic characteristics of the slow start algorithm. The analysis itself allows suggesting solutions and taking decisions.	communications satellite;profiling (computer programming)	Mario Marchese	2001	Computer Communications	10.1016/S0140-3664(00)00361-3	distance education;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;transmission control protocol;internet protocol suite;zeta-tcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;round-trip delay time;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;computer network;bandwidth-delay product;testbed	HPC	-6.431061913579948	92.79616684368277	186077

Recent developments in performance evaluation of rollout mobile communication networks are based on drive-test measurement campaigns as well as on network monitoring and management systems. In addition, large measurement databases as well as data warehouses are created, updated and used for a drill-down statistics analysis. An empirical comparison of modern data mining methods for quality prediction and estimation of speech and video telephony services is presented. Learning prediction models are constructed from live network measurements which have been previously collected by experimental equipment during measurement campaigns. Practically and summing up, the proposed engineering approach is general and is applicable to various radio access network technologies during planning and optimisation phases.	algorithm;data drilling;data mining;database;mathematical optimization;performance evaluation;radio access network;telecommunications network;videotelephony	Charalampos N.

GPRS defines packet-switched service based on GSM and Internet protocol (IP) core networks. It also provides a tunneling protocol called the GPRS tunneling protocol (GTP) by which packets in different protocols can be encapsulated and carried on the IP core network. However, GTP does not optimize packet encapsulation and introduces overhead in data transmission. In this paper, an enhanced GPRS tunneling protocol is thus elaborated. GTP uses a tunneling identifier to specify a tunnel, which belongs a mobile station. The enhanced protocol extends GTP signaling messages and uses a packet data protocol (PDP) address as a tunneling identifier so that the GTP in the data transmission plane can be eliminated. According to the experiments, the enhanced GTP reduces the tunneling overhead and improves the network throughput to a great extreme.	network packet;tunneling protocol	Shiao-Li Charles Tsao	2001		10.1109/ICC.2001.936664	internet protocol;gtp';gsm;embedded system;communications protocol;digital radio;gprs core network;throughput;network service access point identifier;access point name;the internet;3g;core network;ground-penetrating radar;telecommunications;computer science;tunneling protocol;quantum tunnelling;mobile station;layer 2 tunneling protocol;computer network;data transmission;general packet radio service	Networks	-17.894652623763523	90.3009333974301	187104

Therefore, it has been suggested that many other theoretical protocols and systems need to be reevaluated under this different type of traffic before practical implementations potentially show their faults. The ServerNet SAN is a new core technology for server architectures that focuses on moving data. It is a wormholerouted, packet-switched, point-to-point network with special attention paid to reducing latency and assuring reliability. In this paper we investigate the implications of selfsimilar traffic distributions in the ServerNet SAN, and compare the results with those obtained on the basis of the Poisson assumption.	atm turbo;integrated services digital network;network packet;packet switching;performance evaluation;point-to-point (telecommunications);self-similarity;server (computing);servernet;signalling system no. 7;volume boot record;www	Dimiter R.

LISP separates the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses by end point identifiers (EIDs) and locators, respectively. In particular, while EIDs are used in the application and transport layers for identifying nodes, locators are used in the network layer for locating nodes in the network topology. In LISP, packets are tunneled from ingress tunnel routers (ITRs) to egress tunnel routers in a map-and-encapsulation manner. For this purpose, an ITR caches on demand some mappings between EIDs and locators. Since hosts roam from place to place, however, their EID-to-locator mappings change accordingly. Thus, an ITR cannot store a mapping permanently but maintains for every mapping a timer whose default value is set to a given cache timeout. If the cache timeout for a mapping is too short, an ITR frequently queries the mapping system (control plane), resulting in a high traffic load on the control plane. On the other hand, if the cache timeout for a mapping is too long, the mapping could be outdated, resulting in packet loss and associated overheads. Therefore, it is desirable to set appropriate cache timeout for mapping items. In this paper, we analytically determine the optimal cache timeout for EID-to-locator mappings cached at ITRs to minimize the control plane load while remaining efficient for mobility. The results presented here provide valuable insights and guidelines for deploying LISP.	cpu cache;control plane;egress filtering;encapsulation (networking);identifier;mathematical model;network packet;network topology;online locator service;router (computing);scalability;timeout (computing);timer	Hongbin Luo;Hongke Zhang;Chunming Qiao	2013	IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management	10.1109/TNSM.2012.122612.110221	real-time computing;the internet;locator/identifier separation protocol;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;cache algorithms;law;computer security;transport layer;computer network	Networks	-10.772781607688362	88.88871273508876	187958

However, current QoE assessment focuses mainly on audiovisual quality in non-interactive applications, such as video-on-demand services. On the other hand, where experiments aim to quantify interactive quality, the focus is typically targeted at games, using an ad-hoc test setup to assess the impact of network variations on the playing experience. In this paper, we present a novel platform enabling the assessment of a broad range of interactive applications (e.g., thin client remote desktop systems, remotely rendered engineering applications, games). Dynamic reconfiguration of media encoding and decoding is built into the system, to allow dynamic adaptation of the media encoding to the network conditions and the application characteristics. Evaluating the influence of these automatic adaptations is a key asset of our approach. A range of possible use cases is discussed, as well as a performance study of our implementation, showing that the platform we built is capable of highly controllable subjective user assessment. Furthermore, we present results obtained by applying the platform for a subjective evaluation of an interactive multimedia application. Specifically, the influence of visual quality and frame rate on interactive QoE has been assessed for a remotely executed race game.	algorithm;business logic;cloud computing;codec;desktop computer;emoticon;encoder;experiment;graphical user interface;graphics;hoc (programming language);interactivity;mathematical optimization;prototype;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;remote desktop software;requirement;software deployment;streaming media;thin client;usability testing;user research;user experience	Bert Vankeirsbilck;Dieter Verslype;Nicolas Staelens;Pieter Simoens;Chris Develder;Piet Demeester;Filip De Turck;Bart Dhoedt	2013	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-013-1395-y	simulation;human–computer interaction;performance;computer science;software framework;operating system;multimedia;programming language;interactivity;world wide web;computer security;computer network	HCI	-9.087867920640036	100.00190031362928	188044

Burst assembly algorithms are generally designed without taking into consideration the control plane load they lead to. In this study, we propose traffic-adaptive burst assembly algorithms that attempt to minimize the average burst assembly delay subject to burst rate constraints and hence limit the control plane load. The algorithms we propose are simple to implement and we show using synthetic and real traffic traces that they perform substantially better than the usual timer-based schemes.	algorithm;assembly language;byte;computer science;control plane;electrical engineering;embedded system;end-to-end principle;network packet;optical burst switching;sprint (software development);synthetic intelligence;telecommunications network;timer;tracing (software)	Mehmet Altan Toksöz;Nail Akar	2010	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-010-0252-4	real-time computing;optical burst switching;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;burst switching;computer network	Networks	-4.696518388442728	89.57588445260313	188145

The efficiency of these solutions depends on the accuracy of their estimations of available bandwidth; otherwise, their application can be catastrophic on networks. Therefore, accurate bandwidth estimation is fundamental, where each networks characteristic must be taken into consideration, including mobility and medium sharing. Current solutions do not take into account all networks characteristics, resulting to wrong bandwidth estimations and QoS violations. In this paper, we present a new approach for bandwidth reservation - Accurate Bandwidth Reservation (ABR) - which embeds an improved method of available bandwidth measurement, where all criteria of such networks are considered. Evaluation of ABR is performed by simulations and comparisons with some existing approachs.	asynchronous i/o;asynchrony (computer programming);bandwidth (signal processing);hoc (programming language);oddworld: abe's oddysee;qualitative comparative analysis;quality of service;requirement;simulation	Redouane Belbachir;Zoulikha Mekkakia Maaza;Ali Kies;Bernard Cousin	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214240	wireless ad hoc network;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;mobile computing;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Mobile	-4.630190126172018	95.94658643867429	188158
1c22afa5b5a9e59bfbef912504b81fe2956d7658	dynamic novel cross-layer performance enhancement approach for sip over olsr		The SIP signaling performance has a vital role for the overall QoS of SIP-based VoIP applications over MANET. The SIP end-to-end performance metrics have been defined in RFC 6076 to provide a standardized method for the performance evaluation of the SIP signaling system over different platforms. However, to our best acknowledge, the benchmarked values for these metrics have not been proposed yet. Therefore, in this paper, a novel Cross-Layer performance enhancement approach is proposed, implemented, and evaluated to improve the performance of the SIP signaling system over OLSR-based MANET by applying significant dynamic modifications for the routing parameters. The SIP performance metrics seek to accurately reflect the SIP signaling state and the required actions for the routing parameters. The implementation of the Cross-Layer OLSR approach has been successful effectively in reducing the total delays in the SIP processes, enhancing the signaling performance, and increasing the utilization level in the system bandwidth and routing processes.

Wireless ATM will be used to support broadband services in future generation mobile communications. We have studied how to treat the loop cancellation and path optimization of the path extension handover scheme. In this paper, we present path optimization algorithms as a means to effect this treatment; they are polygonal loop cancellation and trigonal loop cancellation. We express the location of the mobile terminal (MT) by direction angles, which we convert into direction vectors. Using these direction vectors, we can ascertain the optimal path of the MT. We compare the proposed scheme with the anchor rerouting scheme in average handover delay, communication disruption delay, buffer requirements, and the total time used for exchanging signalling messages.	atm turbo;mathematical optimization	Young-Keun Park;Woo-Jin Choi	2001	IEEE Trans.

Additionally markets are typically designed with an underlying assumption of participating actors being homogeneous (i.e. using similar wireless architecture). In contrast with above we take an evolutionary approach when designing our market mechanism towards heterogeneous secondary usage of the radio spectrum. The evolution of trading markets is reflected in the incremental steps used in our research, i.e. starting from Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11) capacity markets, followed by super Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11af) capacity markets and finally TV White Spaces (TVWS) spectrum leasing markets. We study the market mechanisms across a heterogeneous set of actors involving both wide area (WA) and local area (LA) operators and focus on creating a win-win scenario for all the participating entities. We make use of literature review and Value Network Configuration (VNC) methodology for illustrating the design of market mechanism and further evaluate the designed mechanism using Agent Based Modeling (ABM). Based on our simulation results we observe that a generic trade-off exist between the length of lease time, trade facilitation cost and the extent of trading activity within the markets. We also observe that there exists an optimal range of lease time for which all the market players find themselves in economically favourable situation. We compare super Wi-Fi capacity markets and TVWS spectrum leasing markets over performance of MOs and TV broadcasters to conclude that a local area strategy seems better suited and more efficient to be adopted for TVWS usage.	agent-based model;clean slate program;emergence;entity;iterative and incremental development;simulation;value network;white spaces (radio)	Ankit Taparia;Thomas R.

The management of the signaling can be integrated as an application into an IPTV Application Server. The IPTV AS is further responsible for all necessary media signaling towards a proper IPTV media server. Such a media server is similar to the ordinary media server known from the voice centric IMS but additionally provides unicast, multicast and broadcast delivery of TV content which is placed by content providers. The media signaling requires a dedicated session description and can be provided by SIP or RTSP. The signaling between user and media server is orchestrated by a service-oriented-archietctue with a session manager acting as middleware. This middleware also provides interfaces for web services triggering IPTV session establishment via Parlay X gateway. This paper proposes a general IMS-based framework for delivering Live TV services over several access networks and presents the corresponding signaling flows for content enquiring and content switching as well as related delays. It furter presents an approach for using SIP and RTSP in cooperation for realizing VOD scenarios.	access network;application server;authentication;end-to-end principle;iptv;information management system (ims);media server;middleware;multicast;multilayer switch;parlay x;server (computing);service-oriented infrastructure;unicast;web service	Christian Riede;Adel Al-Hezmi;Thomas Magedanz	2008		10.1145/1361492.1361517	web service;real time streaming protocol;computer science;operating system;middleware;session initiation protocol;internet privacy;world wide web;ip multimedia subsystem;application server;computer network;access network	Networks	-14.972195668781582	93.12507963183523	188438

An adaptive scheme on video streaming over multi-hop path in P2P networks is proposed. The streaming server probes the network parameters in the multi-hop path periodically, and adjusts the output bit- rate and the encoding structure according to the probing result. The intermediate peer nodes elegantly discard some frames to adapt the output rate to the bandwidth while alleviating the degradation in the decoding video quality in a delay-constrained way. The experimental results show that the video streaming data can be transferred in the multi-hop path efficiently and adaptively by the proposed scheme.	hop;streaming media	Jinfeng Zhang;Jianwei Niu;Rui He;Jian Ma	2007		10.1109/AINAW.2007.68	real-time computing;degradation;computer science;video quality;adaptive system;peer-to-peer;distributed computing;spread spectrum;bandwidth;encoding;computer network	Vision	-6.345136211573448	98.73726356000944	188467

Using fiber optical cabling offers high bandwidth and low error rates. It is supposed to support different kinds of services, e.g., file transfer, videoconferencing, and speech transmissions. To support seamless end-to-end quality of service in a mobile environment a suitable extension to the fixed network part is necessary. In a wireless ATM environment the medium access protocol takes a prominent position. It is responsible for an efficient and fair media access on the shared radio resource. Due to the limited available bandwidth and the much higher error rates on the radio link special provisions must be provided. The compliance of traffic contracts for connections with different quality of services is the aim of our proposed protocol. This is the base of true end-to-end services with quality of service assurance in wireless ATM.

a959c9662ae2a7a9fd603faf2020ce167729a191	predicting the performance of virtual reality video streaming in mobile networks		The demand of Virtual Reality (VR) video streaming to mobile devices is booming, as VR becomes accessible to the general public. However, the variability of conditions of mobile networks affects the perception of this type of high-bandwidth-demanding services in unexpected ways. In this situation, there is a need for novel performance assessment models fit to the new VR applications. In this paper, we present PERCEIVE, a two-stage method for predicting the perceived quality of adaptive VR videos when streamed through mobile networks. By means of machine learning techniques, our approach is able to first predict adaptive VR video playout performance, using network Quality of Service (QoS) indicators as predictors. In a second stage, it employs the predicted VR video playout performance metrics to model and estimate end-user perceived quality. The evaluation of PERCEIVE has been performed considering a real-world environment, in which VR videos are streamed while subjected to LTE/4G network condition. The accuracy of PERCEIVE has been assessed by means of the residual error between predicted and measured values. Our approach predicts the different performance metrics of the VR playout with an average prediction error lower than 3.7% and estimates the perceived quality with a prediction error lower than 4% for over 90% of all the tested cases. Moreover, it allows us to pinpoint the QoS conditions that affect adaptive VR streaming services the most.	heart rate variability;machine learning;mobile device;playout;quality of service;streaming media;virtual reality	Roberto Irajá Tavares da Costa Filho;Marcelo Caggiani Luizelli;Maria Torres Vega;Jeroen van der Hooft;Stefano Petrangeli;Tim Wauters;Filip De Turck;Luciano Paschoal Gaspary	2018		10.1145/3204949.3204966	real-time computing;residual;mean squared prediction error;computer science;quality of service;quality of experience;virtual reality;mobile device	Metrics	-9.337810210826396	99.88969932850273	188741

However, the long-range bit-rate variations in VBR videos make it difficult to efficiently provide quality-of-service control in a video-on-demand system. Existing scheduling algorithms such as Optimal Smoothing, which requires both downward and upward bandwidth reallocations to adapt to the video bit-rate variations, simply cannot guarantee video delivery in networks with mixed video and data traffic. This study tackles this limitation by investigating a new scheduling algorithm with monotonic-decreasing rate allocations for scheduling video data transmissions. By eliminating upward bandwidth reallocations, the proposed scheduler can guarantee video delivery even in the presence of other data traffic in the same network. Moreover, results show that the proposed scheduler can achieve such performance guarantee without tradeoff in performance or resource requirements. This work presents this new monotonic-decreasing rate scheduler, analyzes its fundamental properties, and evaluates its performance using a large number of real-world VBR video traces (274 DVD movies) in extensive trace-driven simulations.	algorithm;apple a5;apple a7;apple a9;case-based reasoning;data compression;digital footprint;memory data register;quality of service;rsa problem;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;smoothing;streaming media;tracing (software);volume boot record	Hin-Lun Lai;Jack Y.

The competitive environment, market potential as well as revenue and cost estimations are part of the analysis that has been conducted within the EUREKA CELTIC project RUBENS. Major findings imply an implicit demand for QoE that remains to be explicated and initiated. A major driver for QoE technologies is the need for network operators to be able to deliver new, personalized and video related services with the quality levels that customers expect. This driver goes along with expected network congestion in the future and the wish for network efficiency increases. This results in the need for access and aggregation networks to become more cost efficient, whereas increasing expenditures for control and application servers would be coherent to customer expectations.	application server;cloud computing;coherence (physics);cost efficiency;customer support;ecosystem;itil;network congestion;personalization;provisioning;software quality assurance;usability;web application	Thomas Monath;Mario Kind;Tobias Heger;Maximilian D.

Eureka starts with constructing a priority queue and sending low priority traffic through it. Then, the application under study is started with its packets marked as high priority. These packets therefore displace the previously existing low priority packets on the priority queue. We can measure this displacement and thus, the bandwidth used by the application. Unlike tcpdump this can be done while the application is running and without knowing any application specific data. In this paper we use Eureka to study the bandwidth usage of Massive Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs), BZFlag and World of Warcraft-Trial, along with the 3D multi-site collaborative environments. A major strength of our methodology is that it provides run-time estimations of the bandwidth usage without interfering with the application, the environment, or the server/peer data. Moreover, Eureka is independent of the application and new infrastructure or tools are not required.	bandwidth (signal processing);displacement mapping;eureka (opac);network packet;priority queue;run time (program lifecycle phase);server (computing);world of warcraft;tcpdump	Ishan Vaishnavi;Ahsan Arefin;Dick C.

They each can be deployed to facilitate connection between the end users and the Internet but each of them suffers from some drawbacks if operating separately. To combine the bandwidth advantage of optical networks with the mobility feature of wireless communications, we propose a convergence of EPON and 802.16 networks in this paper. First, this paper starts with presenting the converged network architecture and especially the concept of virtual ONU-BS (VOB). Then, it identifies some unique research issues in this converged network. Second, the paper investigates a dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) scheme and its closely associated research issues. This DBA scheme takes into consideration the specific features of the converged network to enable a smooth data transmission across optical and wireless networks, and an end-to-end differentiated service to user traffics of diverse QoS (Quality of Service) requirements. This QoS-aware DBA scheme supports bandwidth fairness at the VOB level and class-of-service fairness at the 802.16 subscriber station level.

As a result, content, network, and Internet service providers can deliver video content over IP networks. To provide a high-quality service, the quality of experience (QoE) is becoming much more important. Since QoE is affected by such factors as the audiovisual content, encoding and decoding techniques, and network performance, service providers should monitor the QoE of a communication service in real time to confirm its status. To do this, a quality monitoring tool is necessary. The International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication Standardization Sector Study Group 12 (ITU-T SG12) has studied the parametric non-intrusive assessment of audiovisual media streaming quality (P.NAMS). The P.NAMS - lower resolution application area was finally standardized as ITU-T Recommendation P.1201.1 in October 2012. The P.1201.1 model can be used for estimating audio, video, and audiovisual quality for mobile audiovisual media streaming using packet headers. Since the model analyzes only packet header information, the computational power of the model is very light, and the model can be applied to encrypted packets. This paper describes the P.1201.1 model and its performance.	binary decoder;computation;digital video;encoder;encryption;internet protocol suite;network packet;network performance;quality of service;streaming media	Kazuhisa Yamagishi;Shan Gao	2013	2013 IEEE 15th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)	10.1109/MMSP.2013.6659333	the internet;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;video quality;multimedia;pevq;computer network	Metrics	-9.282124573503854	100.66454682845456	189703

Although mobile users have experienced a large improvement in wireless access networks in the last years, live-streaming videos still face several challenges, especially for large-scale popular events. Therefore, understanding live streaming for mobile users becomes imperative nowadays. This paper targets at the characterization of mobile user behaviors, The main goal of this paper is to understand the behavior of mobile users when watching large popular live events in Brazil, such as 2016 former Brazilian president Impeachment and 2016 Opening Ceremony for Rio Olympic Games. We focus our analysis on comprehending the influence of interruptions on the session duration and new attempts to rejoin the video transmission. The results show that a significant number of mobile users experiences low transmission rates and the type of event imply different user behaviors.	access network;content delivery network;imperative programming;internet;mobile device;streaming media;winsock;wireless access point	Daniel Vasconcelos Correa da Silva;Guilherme de Melo Baptista Domingues;Pedro B.

The performance requirements of the new applications span from few milliseconds to hundreds of seconds. In spite of the continuous technological improvement (e.g., faster servers and clients, multi-threaded browsers supporting several simultaneous and persistent TCP connections, access to the network with larger bandwidth for both servers and clients), the network performance as captured by response time and throughput does not keep up and progressively degrades. Several are the causes of the poor “Quality of Web Services” that users very often experience. The characteristics of the traffic (self-similarity and heavy-tailedness) and the widely varying resource requirements (in terms of bandwidth, size and number of downloaded objects, processor time, number of I/Os, etc.) of web requests are among the most important ones. Other factors refer to the architectural complexity of the network path connecting the client browser to the web server and to the protocols behavior at the different layers. In this paper we present a study of the performance of web services. The first part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of the origins of the fluctuations in web data traffic. This peculiar characteristic is one of the most important causes of the performance degradation of web applications. In the second part of the paper experimental measurements of performance indices, such as end-to-end response time, TCP connection time, transfer time, of several web applications are presented. The presence of self-similarity characteristics in the traffic measurements is shown.	download;elegant degradation;end-to-end principle;internet protocol suite;mathematical optimization;network congestion;network performance;requirement;response time (technology);self-similarity;server (computing);thread (computing);throughput;web application;web performance;web server;web service;web traffic	Paolo Cremonesi;Giuseppe Serazzi	2002		10.1007/3-540-45798-4_8	web service;the internet;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;performance indicator;database;distributed computing;network performance;world wide web;computer security;service quality;channel capacity;telecommunications network	Metrics	-7.407652937138099	93.59774618502927	190307

These shortcomings become a major issue for railways as GSM-R may limit the number of running trains in some areas and it cannot support advanced data services. Hence, alternative technologies, such as LTE, have to be considered as a future railway communication technology.

Our mobile devices are demanding for more network resources, in terms of traffic volume and QoS requirements. Unfortunately, it is very hard for a multihomed device to be simultaneously connected to the network through multiple links. The current work enhances the network access of multihomed devices, agnostically to the deployed access technologies. This enhancement is achieved by using simultaneously all of the mobile devices interfaces, and by routing each individual data flow through the most convenient access technology. The proposed solution is only deployed at the network side and it extends Proxy Mobile IPv6 with flow mobility in a completely transparent way to mobile nodes. In fact, it gives particular attention to the handover mechanisms, by improving the detection and attachment of nodes in the network, with the inclusion of the IEEE 802.21 standard in the solution. This provides the necessary implementation and integration details to extend a network topology with femtocell devices. Each femtocell is equipped with various network interfaces, supporting a diverse set of access technologies. There is also a decision entity that individually manages each data flow according to its QoS requisites. The proposed solution has been developed and extensively tested with a real prototype. Evaluation results evidence that the overhead for using the solution is negligible as compared to the offered advantages such as: the support of flow mobility, the fulfil of VoIP functional requisites, the session continuity in spite of & Rui Neto Marinheiro rui.marinheiro@iscte.pt Hugo Alves hugo.ma.alves@gmail.com Luı́s Miguel Silva lmbsa@iscte-iul.pt José André R.

In this paper, we introduce hybrid MAC scheme for vehicular communications which enhances the performance of IEEE 802.11p based communication system. The proposed MAC scheme supports high throughput by combining carrier sensing multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) with TDMA. The benefits of proposed schemes are verified by simulations.

Native mode ATM access offers full access to ATM's Quality of Service capabilities in homogeneous ATM networks and provides support for a wide range of information streams with different properties and requirements. The author presents a native ATM service architecture offering a common service access point for establishing virtual connections and additional transport layer functionality such as end-to-end error, flow and congestion control, datagram transfer and VC multiplexing. The author introduces the elements of the architecture, their functionality and capabilities. ATM networks are characterized by sudden changes in the available bandwidth due to the arrival or departure of constant bit rate (CBR) or variable bit rate (VBR) connections, and short term congestion in ATM switches caused by sporadic superimpositions of bursts from several sources. The author focuses on protocol mechanisms aimed at maximising effective end-to-end throughput (goodput) on data channels using ATM's best effort service, the unspecified bit rate (UBR) service.	atm turbo;performance evaluation	Raschid Karabek	1997		10.1109/LCN.1997.630989	local area network;best-effort delivery;throughput;real-time computing;error detection and correction;quality of service;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;atm adaptation layer;service-oriented architecture;asynchronous transfer mode;flow control;distributed computing;variable bitrate;constant bitrate;network congestion;transport layer;bandwidth;computer network	Arch	-4.7017129379620695	98.08656891374356	190761

So, IPv6 is coming with new features and improvements for the devices that will be connected to the network. Therefore, some transition mechanisms are required during the time of migration from IPv4 to IPv6 networks. Furthermore, the BDMS has been proposed and designed as an IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanism. In this paper, we implement the BDMS in order to study its behavior when different buffer sizes are used. The OMNeT++ simulator is used to evaluate the performance of BDMS using different performance evaluation metrics such as RTT, EED, and Total Queuing Delay for each communication session between IPv4 and IPv6 hosts. Thus,the simulation results in this paper show that, when the translator buffer size increases, the RTT and EED for this communication session increase as well.	performance evaluation;queuing delay;session (computer science);simulation	Ra'ed AlJa'afreh;John Mellor;Irfan-Ullah Awan	2008	2008 Second UKSIM European Symposium on Computer Modeling and Simulation	10.1109/EMS.2008.71	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	-5.803656550785037	92.61225430490578	190913

Due to the sporadic nature of contact opportunities, applications in the domain of device-to-device communication are assumed to be delay-tolerant, with content delivery deadlines being in the order of hours. However, predictions suggest that by 2020 more than 75% of the traffic volumes at mobile operators will be generated by multimedia contents which is often seen as data served in real-time. In this paper we explore how the concept of opportunistic networking can be used for dissemination of real-time streaming contents for users in urban environments without degrading quality of experience. We first present a general framework for offloading multimedia data that is organized in terms of playlists, and we then investigate the performance of the framework in realistic urban environments using the music streaming service Spotify as a use-case. Our results show that it is feasible to use opportunistic device-to-device communication in the context of music streaming. We demonstrate that the system performance is insensitive to a number of parameters such as playlist length distribution, and initial content availability distribution, however it exhibits sensitivity towards the amount of requested data and the node density.	digital distribution;download;mobile data offloading;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;simulation;sparse matrix;streaming media	Sylvia T.

With our mechanism, the EDCA parameter sets can be easily configured via software interface in off-the-shelf WiFi phone products and it is not required to modify the operations of access points or 802.11 MAC layer protocols. The performance of our mechanism is evaluated via ns-2 simulations and via laboratory experiments over Quanta's 02 dual-mode handsets. The results show our mechanism can provide effective and efficient QoS provisioning for VoIP traffic over IEEE 802.11 WLANs.	distributed control system;experiment;provisioning;quality of service;quanta computer;simulation;wireless access point	Jeng-Farn Lee;Jie-Ming Chen;Wanjiun Liao;Hsiu-Hui Lee;Meng Chang Chen	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo	10.1109/ICME.2007.4284838	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;voice over ip;wireless multimedia extensions;computer network	Embedded	-14.520418310490681	92.91023213210171	191045

In medical imaging, picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) are computers or networks dedicated to the storage, retrieval, distribution and presentation of images. PACS application over the Internet is one of the poplar telemedicine. Traffic Engineering (TE) approaches are mainly proposed to utilize networking resources. In order to enable TE to work effectively, a criterion of PACS metric is needed to evaluate the quality of end-to-end path over the Internet. This paper presents a novel PACS metric that takes the number of “Qualified Flow: QFlow” as the criteria to evaluate the end-to-end path capability for PACS flows. The proposed metric is based on the regression methodology. The proposed metric helps TE to make a decision for routing or/and forwarding at the end path. For example, a load balancer at the end path can use a path cost calculated by such metric to make a decision to distribute PACS traffic over several available end-to-end paths more efficiently. The experiment results proved that the proposed method give the high accurate estimation.	archive;computer;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;internet;load balancing (computing);medical imaging;physics and astronomy classification scheme;picture archiving and communication system;quality of service;routing;test engineer	Sanon Chimmanee	2013	The International Conference on Information Networking 2013 (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2013.6496404	the internet;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer security;regression analysis;computer network	HPC	-10.051752875120297	95.06235696095345	191087

Although basic architectures and protocols have been developed for such networks, detailed performance tuning and analysis are still needed, especially when these networks scale to serve many diverse TV channels to numerous subscribers. The detailed performance analysis could also motivate designing new protocols and algorithms for enhancing future mobile TV networks. Currently, many researchers evaluate the performance of mobile TV networks using simulation and/or theoretical modeling methods. These methods, while useful for early assessment, typically abstract away many necessary details of actual, fairly complex, networks. Therefore, an open-source platform for evaluating new ideas in a real mobile TV network is needed. This platform is currently not possible with commercial products, because they are sold as black boxes without the source code. In this article, we summarize our experiences in designing and implementing a testbed for mobile TV networks. We integrate off-the-shelf hardware components with carefully designed software modules to realize a scalable testbed that covers almost all aspects of real networks. We use our testbed to empirically analyze various performance aspects of mobile TV networks and validate/refute several claims made in the literature as well as discover/quantify multiple important performance tradeoffs.	algorithm;black box;mobile television;open-source software;performance tuning;scalability;simulation;testbed	Mohamed Hefeeda;Cheng-Hsin Hsu	2012	TOMCCAP	10.1145/2071396.2071399	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;world wide web;complex network;computer network;source code;testbed	Mobile	-6.849810597316082	92.9280102465072	191125

A flow is identified by the source address, destination address, and the flow ID. It is possible to set up a cached flowhandling state as the first packet of the flow is processed on network layer (layer 3). The following packets are forwarded based on the information in cache. This makes an enormous save of time in layer 3 processing delay. The transitioning to IPv6 requires dual stacks at routers, i.e. the ability to handle both IPv6 and IPv4.

Given the popularity of digital video and the growing interest in live video streams where channel coding errors cannot be corrected, such a system would give great insight into the problem of video corruption through transmission errors and how they are perceived by the user. In this paper we introduce such a system, where digital video can be corrupted according to established loss patterns and the effect is measured automatically. The corrupted video is then used as input for user tests. Their results are analyzed and compared with the automatically generated. Within this paper we present the complete testing system that makes use of existing software as well as introducing new modules and extensions. With the current configuration the system can test packet loss in H.264 coded video streams and produce a statistical analysis detailing the results. The system is fully modular allowing for future developments such as other types of statistical analysis, different video measurements and new video codecs.	channel capacity;codec;digital video;forward error correction;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;network packet;streaming media;testbed	Mu Mu;Andreas Mauthe;John Casson;Gareth Tyson;Francisco Garcia	2009	2009 5th International Conference on Testbeds and Research Infrastructures for the Development of Networks & Communities and Workshops	10.1109/TRIDENTCOM.2009.4976208	video compression picture types;error detection and correction;quality of service;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;video quality;video tracking;multimedia;software testing;video processing;packet loss;motion compensation;system testing;encoding;computer network;testbed	Networks	-8.476092654267285	101.36293756798825	191699

Novel methods must take into account the specific artifacts introduced by digital compression techniques. This paper presents a methodology using circular backpropagation (CBP) neural networks for the objective quality assessment of motion picture expert group (MPEG) video streams. Objective features are continuously extracted from compressed video streams on a frame-by-frame basis; they feed the CBP network estimating the corresponding perceived quality. The resulting adaptive modeling of subjective perception supports a real-time system for monitoring displayed video quality. The overall system mimics perception but does not require an analytical model of the underlying physical phenomenon. The ability to process compressed video streams represents a crucial advantage over existing approaches, as avoiding the decoding process greatly enhances the system's real-time performance. Experimental evidence confirmed the approach validity. The system was tested on real test videos; they included different contents ranging from fiction to sport. The neural model provided a satisfactory, continuous-time approximation for actual scoring curves, which was validated statistically in terms of confidence analysis. As expected, videos with slow-varying contents such as fiction featured the best performances.	approximation;artificial neural network;backpropagation;compression artifact;cumulative trauma disorders;data compression;estimated;extraction;h.262/mpeg-2 part 2;mpeg-2;morphologic artifacts;moving picture experts group;neural network simulation;performance;physical phenomena;real-time clock;real-time computing;score;streaming media;contents - htmllinktype;standards characteristics	Paolo Gastaldo;Stefano Rovetta;Rodolfo Zunino	2002	IEEE transactions on neural networks	10.1109/TNN.2002.1021894	data compression;subjective video quality;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;video quality;machine learning;multimedia;artificial neural network	Visualization	-8.837913228029404	101.75687420958384	191829

Before I attempt to do so, it is necessary to explore the current short-term changes in technology and usage that will impact the directions of the future. The demands for increased bandwidths to the home and office has been motivated by several facts. The material offered on the WorldWide Web is largely graphical, thus straining the limited speeds of analog line modems and even ISDN beyond comfort. The increase in telecommuting by the small business operator and the employees of many large companies has also increased and will continue to increase the demands for persistent high-speed access to the facilities of the Internet. This, combined with a major battle starting for the consumer's communication dollars (between the cable and telephone industries), has caused the development, and soon the installation, of high-speed access to the communications infrastruc-ture—telephone and data via cable modem and digital subscriber line (DSL) technology. In the TV cable modem case, speeds in the neighborhood of 10Mbps downstream (to the consumer) and from 64Kbps to several megabits per second back from the user are being developed, tried, and offered. In the DSL case, the aim is to provide, on top of the normal voice copper line, data rates of 6Mbps in the asymmetric case (like the cable modem) to possibly the same speed in each direction. In the case of cable modems, the telephone industry sees these as the first step to the voice bypass business for the cable operators. The cable industry clearly sees DSL as the way of offering TV to the home by the telephone companies. In each case, the companies view the data traffic as a side issue to the established business of voice or TV. I speak as if data is a different animal from the voice and video traffic. The Internet technology has shown that it is feasible to carry voice, video, and two-way telephony on the Internet structure via a number of experiments and corporate startups. While the current Internet protocols do not properly handle the demands for predictable bandwidth and latency demanded by these services the next generation Inter-net protocol—IPNG—will address these issues. Combined with the widespread deployment of ATM technology in the communications infrastructure, IPNG will allow the proper servicing of this type …	atm turbo;bandwidth (signal processing);cable modem;data rate units;digital subscriber line;downstream (software development);experiment;graphical user interface;integrated services digital network;internet protocol suite;local loop;megabit;next-generation network;software deployment;telecommuting;world wide web	David J.

In general, a realtime location tracking scheme may require complex control schemes and incur unacceptably high computation and messaging cost. Our proposed approach, namely velocity paging scheme, relaxes the realtime constraints to semi-realtime to provide a good combination of cost reduction and ease of implementation. The proposed velocity paging scheme utilizes semi-realtime velocity information, namely velocity classes, of individual mobile terminals and dynamically calculates a paging zone (a list of cells to be paged) for an incoming call. Therefore, the total paging cost can be reduced due to the paging area reduction. Much consideration also has been given to reduce the complexity of the proposed scheme. As a result, it only requires minimal extra overhead and is feasible to implement in current cellular/PCS networks. The velocity paging can be combined with the movement-based registration or other registration schemes. Analytical and simulation results of the velocity paging and movement-based registration combination are provided to demonstrate the cost eeectiveness of the scheme under various parameters in comparison with the location area scheme.	computation;overhead (computing);paging;semiconductor industry;simulation;velocity (software development)	Guang Wan;Eric C.

Sensor's technology enables today the collection of various data related to the environment, such as temperature, location, and so on. This information can be delivered timely to users interacting with the environment. For example, a user might get direction in a building or in a park. Our architecture uses a network of gateways as an hierarchical virtual infrastructure to interconnect various network domains. Gateways are responsible for translation among different communication protocols, including routing, signalling, and security. HMD architecture is scalable, flexible and adaptive to QoS needs for interdomain communications. The protocol goal is to optimize such communications in terms of performance.	gateway (telecommunications);head-mounted display;hoc (programming language);inter-domain;interaction;requirement;routing;scalability;sensor;smart environment;smartphone	Mimoza Durresi;Arjan Durresi;Leonard Barolli;Kazunori Uchida	2015	2015 IEEE 29th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops	10.1109/WAINA.2015.119	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	-8.512014903812984	89.45965595817435	191964

Since reference information is absent in many practical situations, video quality assessment with No-Reference (NR) measures is attracting increasing attention from both industry and academia. However, there are very few commercial quality assessment systems for mobile devices available in today's market. After describing a set of applications, we briefly survey the state-of-the-art in NR video quality assessment. Finally, we present a real-time quality monitoring system for video transmitted to mobile devices and describe a proof-of-concept implementation. In this system, the quality of video at different nodes and terminals in a transmission channel can be monitored and tracked through a remote software interface. These video quality measurements can also provide valuable information for network diagnosis and quality-scalable service planning.	channel (communications);mobile device;noise reduction;real-time clock;real-time locating system;scalability;video	Tao Liu;Glenn L.

6868963dfa8947b40329d02df44e285290b10403	modeling continuous video qoe evolution: a state space approach		A rapid increase in the video traffic together with an increasing demand for higher quality videos has put a significant load on content delivery networks in the recent years. Due to the relatively limited delivery infrastructure, the video users in HTTP streaming often encounter dynamically varying quality over time due to rate adaptation, while the delays in video packet arrivals result in rebuffering events. The user quality-of-experience (QoE) degrades and varies with time because of these factors. Thus, it is imperative to monitor the QoE continuously in order to minimize these degradations and deliver an optimized QoE to the users. Towards this end, we propose a nonlinear state space model for efficiently and effectively predicting the user QoE on a continuous time basis. The QoE prediction using the proposed approach relies on a state space that is defined by a set of carefully chosen time varying QoE determining features. An evaluation of the proposed approach conducted on two publicly available continuous QoE databases shows a superior QoE prediction performance over the state-of-the-art QoE modeling approaches. The evaluation results also demonstrate the efficacy of the selected features and the model order employed for predicting the QoE. Finally, we show that the proposed model is completely state controllable and observable, so that the potential of state space modeling approaches can be exploited for further improving QoE prediction.	content delivery network;database;imperative programming;network packet;nonlinear system;observable;state space;state-space representation;streaming media	Nagabhushan Eswara;Hemanth P.

However, if home networks are firewall-protected, mobile users can not access their home networks without successful authentication. So mobile users are out of contact with their home agents and then get lost to some extent. In this paper, we consider the case that, in mobile IPv4, a mobile node away from home obtains a care-of address from a foreign agent and communicates with its home agent and a correspondent node that are both behind the firewall of the home network. Our solution can achieve successful firewall traversal as well as end-to-end security by applying IPsec mechanisms on network entities. It does not require any modification of protocols and network entities. Besides, if foreign agents are deployed hierarchically, the security associations do not need to be renegotiated whenever a mobile node changes its network attachment point.	attachments;authentication;care-of address;communications protocol;end-to-end principle;entity;firewall (computing);ipsec;mobile ip;scalability;seamless3d;security association;software deployment	Jin Tang;John A.

On the other hand, the security protocols can affect applications to varying degrees depending on the network conditions. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the overhead introduced by the security mechanisms in WLAN such as authentication. To do so, we develop an analytical model based on random errors to evaluate the authentication delay for various error rates taking into account the reliability mechanisms involved. We also measure the authentication delay for WLAN 802.11b using CISCO access point and client cards. We generate the average, minimum and maximum delay for the different authentication configuration available in the CISCO security suite. The analytical and the experimental results are compliant. The major contributor of the authentication delay is the probing time needed to detect the surrounding access point.	128-bit;authentication;cryptographic protocol;network congestion;overhead (computing);seamless3d;wired equivalent privacy;wireless access point	Hanane Fathi;Kazukuni Kobara;Shyam S.

23607513375e95a1986c0a3bf402da9d8cfb2728	walls have ears: traffic-based side-channel attack in video streaming		Video streaming takes up an increasing proportion of network traffic nowadays. Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) becomes the de facto standard of video streaming and it is adopted by Youtube, Netflix, etc. Despite of the popularity, network traffic during video streaming shows identifiable pattern which brings threat to user privacy. In this paper, we propose a video identification method using network traffic while streaming. Though there is bitrate adaptation in DASH streaming, we observe that the video bitrate trend remains relatively stable because of the widely used Variable Bit-Rate (VBR) encoding. Accordingly, we design a robust video feature extraction method for eavesdropped video streaming traffic. Meanwhile, we design a VBR based video fingerprinting method for candidate video set which can be built using downloaded video files. Finally, we propose an efficient partial matching method for computing similarities between video fingerprints and streaming traces to derive video identities. We evaluate our attack method in different scenarios for various video content, segment lengths and quality levels. The experimental results show that the identification accuracy can reach up to 90 % using only three-minute continuous network traffic eavesdropping.	algorithm;digital video fingerprinting;dynamic adaptive streaming over http;feature extraction;fingerprint (computing);hypertext transfer protocol;information leakage;network packet;network traffic control;seamless3d;side-channel attack;spectral leakage;streaming media;tracing (software);video clip;video file format;volume boot record	Jiaxi Gu;Jiliang Wang;Zhiwen Yu;Kele Shen	2018	IEEE INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8486211	computer network;variable bitrate;dynamic adaptive streaming over http;dash;feature extraction;side channel attack;computer science;server;eavesdropping	Metrics	-13.104363325844687	101.80122101297331	192220

The chosen technology should enable seamless communication between grid devices, applications, consumers, and operators. In addition, it should guarantee adequate network resources for smart grid functions by fulfilling bandwidth, availability, QoS, and latency requirements. Energy companies have been seeking for a cost-effective and reliable communication technology to support their grid automation and control. Evolved cellular technologies, like LTE, have been found compelling, because they offer low latency, high throughput, commercial advantages of a global standard ecosystem, cost effective solutions in comparison to dedicated communication infrastructures, and rapid deployment. This paper presents the results of a feasibility study of using commercial networks, namely GSM, UMTS and LTE, for the remote control of medium voltage electric distribution networks.	compaq lte;ecosystem;home automation;quality of service;remote control;requirement;seamless3d;smart tv;software deployment;throughput	Seppo Horsmanheimo;Niwas Maskey;Lotta Tuomimäki	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)	10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007686	embedded system;telecommunications;engineering;smart grid;computer network	HPC	-15.414624997547218	90.08808426736493	192301

These capabilities require large counter arrays in order to monitor the traffic of all network flows. While commodity SRAM memories are capable of operating at line speed, they are too small to accommodate large counter arrays. Previous works suggested estimators, which trade precision for reduced space. However, in order to accurately estimate the largest counter, these methods compromise the accuracy of the rest of the counters. In this work we present a closed form representation of the optimal estimation function. We then introduce Independent Counter Estimation Buckets (ICE-Buckets), a novel algorithm that improves estimation accuracy for all counters. This is achieved by separating the flows to buckets and configuring the optimal estimation function according to each bucket's counter scale. We prove an improved upper bound on the relative error and demonstrate an accuracy improvement of up to 57 times on real Internet packet traces.	algorithm;approximation error;fairness measure;hardware platform interface;intrusion detection system;load balancing (computing);network packet;program counter;recursion;routing;static random-access memory;tracing (software)	Gil Einziger;Benny Fellman;Yaron Kassner	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)	10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218646	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;estimation theory;statistics	Vision	-6.1996349902494465	90.40112966069823	192694

It can transform industries, it can empower consumers, it can connect businesses and it can unleash creativity. In 2008 there’s no question that the entertainment industry is being transformed by technology, as for better or for worse, the business models underpinning the music, television and film worlds are changing and changing fast. An initiating event in any major transformation is a disruption, the appearance of a disruptive technology. Past disruptive technologies include PCs, VCRs, the Internet and mobile phones, all of these technologies initiating and bringing about great change in the entertainment industry. More specifically, Napster disrupted the music business in much the same way that Bittorrent disrupted the TV and film business. These technologies were disruptive, they were transformative but there is a new technology coming down the pike that may have enormous implications for Hollywood, perhaps as much as Napster and Bittorrent put together since it could simultaneously impact music, TV and film. Like you, I love technology but one downside of technology is that it involves wires my laptop is wired to my broadband source, to my printer, to my mass storage device, to my flash drive and on and on and on in seemingly exponential fashion. In fact, there are so many wires in my place that I trip over one and cuss on pretty much a daily basis. The new technology poised to disrupt and transform Hollywood can best be described with a paraphrased campaign promise from one former President Bush: No New Wires. This new technology is called Wireless USB and not only does it promise no new wires but in fact it promises to eliminate existing wires, thus saving us all from a good deal of tripping and related cussing. Wireless USB combines the speed and security of wired USB with the ease-of-use of wireless and while there are other technologies such as WirelessHD which is up to 10 times faster one thing that differentiates Wireless USB is its backwards-compatibility with the existing universe of wired USB products. There are over two billion existing USB connections in the world (PCs, consumer electronics, mobile, etc) and having them easily share data through fast wireless connections opens up a wide array of possibilities. How does Wireless USB work? It’s an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radio technology, spreading out low-power pulses across many different frequencies. Wireless USB products can generally operate north of 6 GHz so they are out of the frequency range of mobile phones and/or Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz).

For this purpose, past recent researches focused on measuring (when possible) or estimating (most of the times) network QoS or performance parameters. Up to now, attempts to provide accurate techniques for estimating such parameters have failed. In addition, live reporting of the estimated network status requires a huge amount of resources, and lead to unscalable systems. The originality of the contribution presented in this paper, relies on the statement that the accurate estimation of network QoS parameters is absolutely not required in most cases: specifically it is sufficient to be aware of service disruptions, i.e. when the QoS provided by the network collapses. For this purpose, we propose an algorithm for disruption detection of network services. The proposed solution is based on the use of the wellknown Kullback-Leibler Divergence algorithm. More specifically, we work on simple to measure time series, i.e. received interpacket arrival times. In addition of efficiently detecting network QoS disruptions, the algorithm, also drastically reduces the required resources, and the overhead produced by the traffic collection for scalable SLA monitoring systems. The validity of the proposal is verified both in terms of accuracy and consumed resources in a real testbed, using different traffic profiles.	algorithm;computation;denial-of-service attack;egress filtering;end-to-end principle;network packet;online and offline;overhead (computing);scalability;sensor;service-level agreement;synthetic intelligence;testbed;the times;time of arrival;time series	René Serral-Gracià;Yann Labit;Jordi Domingo-Pascual;Philippe Owezarski	2009	IEEE INFOCOM 2009	10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062191	estimation;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;time series;data mining;accuracy and precision;software testing;kullback–leibler divergence;computer security;measurement;statistics;time;computer network	Metrics	-5.9343358194435885	90.48801431463914	192837

While this problem is well understood and solved for existing audio coding schemes, support from the video coding standards themselves is required for video streams. This paper presents the newly introduced error resilience mechanisms built into the second version of H.263 (1998), known under its working name H.263+, and addresses the corresponding packetization format issues that together significantly improve the image quality at packet loss rates up to 20 per cent. In particular, it is support from the video coding algorithm itself peered with appropriate transport layer mechanisms that leads to significant improvements of perceived image quality for communicative as well as retrieval applications at moderate bit rates up to some 100 kbit/s.	algorithm;data compression;data rate units;image quality;lossy compression;network packet;packet switching;real-time clock;streaming media;usenet;video coding format	Jörg Ott;Stephan Wenger;Gerd D.

We use the artifice of agent-cache to reduce traffic and take some proper control to avoid dirty data been read by one. Our content includes that user data can be updated in time by virtue of validating the consistency of data among the client, agent and server. A new Callback Validating Policy is presented by us for mobile environment because the current arithmetic for this is believed with the problem of writing delay, in which the cache data need be revalidated again when any client appears.Manage client’s cache and transmit failed data, the agent harmonizes and simplifies the relationship between a mobile client and a server. Then the problems which come from mobility, disconnection and writing delay can be abated distinctly.	access network;callback (computer programming);dirty data;distributed computing;mobile computing;server (computing)	Rubing Liang;Qiong Liu	2009	2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering	10.1109/CSIE.2009.528	software architecture;real-time computing;mobile search;mobile telephony;mobile database;computer science;software agent;operating system;mobile technology;database;distributed computing;mobile computing;writing;wireless;server;computer network	Mobile	-12.319639989136425	89.10946731471647	193262

However, as more personal and business applications migrate to the cloud, service quality will become an important differentiator between providers. In particular, quality of experience as perceived by users has the potential to become the guiding paradigm for managing quality in the cloud. In this article, we discuss technical challenges emerging from shifting services to the cloud, as well as how this shift impacts QoE and QoE management. Thereby, a particular focus is on multimedia cloud applications. Together with a novel QoE-based classification scheme of cloud applications, these challenges drive the research agenda on QoE management for cloud applications.	cloud computing;comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;computation;context awareness;differentiator;emoticon;entity;internet;programming paradigm;quality of service;scalability;seamless3d;software as a service;software deployment;usability	Tobias Hoßfeld;Raimund Schatz;Martín Varela;Christian Timmerer	2012	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2012.6178831	quality management;quality of service;usability;cloud computing;computer science;multimedia;world wide web;service quality;software quality;computer network	Metrics	-9.994033717689927	100.67273325622179	193328

With increasing of multimedia traffic, quality of experience (QoE) needs to be satisfied at users while overall performance needs to be maintained at networks. In order to achieve these goals, the use of network selection mechanism is inevitable. When several access points are present, user should select the best available network while trying to keep load balanced between access networks. In this paper, we present a user-based and network-assisted scheme for network selection in wireless IEEE 802.11 technology. By providing users in decision making process with relevant information about the networks, the proposed solution keeps compromising advantage for both user and network. Our mechanism is based on a technique called pseudo-subjective quality assessment (PSQA), which is used basically to measure quality of experience perceived by users. We propose a new scheme where PSQA tool is used to assist in terminal-centric network selection. We explain the scheme and illustrate its efficient performance compared to a signal-based mechanism.	access network;prospective search;semantic network;wireless access point	Kandaraj Piamrat;Adlen Ksentini;César Viho;Jean-Marie Bonnin	2008	2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2008.4664195	decision-making;ieee 802.11;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;recurrent neural network;load balancing;wireless network;computer network;satisfiability;access network	Mobile	-10.75439181653772	99.76766711222558	193992

The analysis presents the advantages and disadvantages of the implementation of several different protocol mechanisms, such as packet or block mode data transfer. It is based on the processing complexity associated with executing each protocol function. Results show that a feature-rich transport protocol can be implemented in which the protocol control processing overhead is not prohibitive to providing high performance to an application. Instead, the benefits of a lean protocol are achieved because the protocol services better fit application requirements. Also, the primary bottleneck for data transfer is shown to be the complexity associated with error control, which can reduced through the technique of transmitting packets in blocks. >	max;profiling (computer programming);software feature	Thomas F.

With devices ranging from cellular phones to TV's, there is a challenge faced by content service providers to support multimedia delivery for a diverse set of devices. Scalable video coding (SVC) may provide a solution by enabling devices with techniques to extract video streams scaled to match their capabilities. However, SVC can be significantly bandwidth inefficient. By sending the highest possible quality stream over the network, irrespective of the capabilities of the end-devices and the network, SVC can limit the number of devices being served and reduce the network's average quality satisfaction. In this paper, we present a device and network- aware scaling (DeNAS) framework to address these problems. Based on device capability information, network capacity, and the desired service objective, DeNAS finds the suitable scaling level for each video stream prior to its delivery over the wireless network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DeNAS through simulation and show that DeNAS is able to improve quality satisfaction, increase bandwidth efficiency, and satisfy a greater number of clients simultaneously.	algorithm;data compression;display resolution;image scaling;mobile phone;scalable video coding;simulation;spectral efficiency;streaming media;uc browser	Naomi Ramos;Sujit Dey	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394082	scalable video coding;multi-frequency network;service provider;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;spectral efficiency;computer network;satisfiability	Mobile	-8.488614388611925	99.86011611152047	194394

Netlnf is well suited for mobile communications and wireless content dissemination. One of the key aspects of Netlnf operation is its native capacity to take advantage of overlapping multiaccess environments and distributed in-network storage. This paper introduces Netlnf multiaccess operation taking cues from state-of-the-art peer-to-peer content distribution. In order to evaluate multiaccess operation in practice we consider the requirements and deployment environment for Netlnf, including a migration approach to adopting Netlnf concepts. We conduct measurements, specify the necessary signaling to enhance Bit Torrent operation over multiaccess, multi-domain networks and develop a prototype to explore the design space. The paper also introduces the Netlnf Notification Service.

In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel system-level design that guarantees QoS by eliminating the service latency for short videos over IEEE 802.11 networks. Furthermore, our VoD system attains scalable performance by employing collocated access points (APs) coupled with an efficient association management of clients to the APs using a generic least-loaded-first heuristic on non-overlapping channels. Simulated results of our VoD system demonstrated that it achieved scalable performance due to its effective use of available bandwidth of the APs while supporting a low blockage rate for short videos up to 360 s. These results suggest that our VoD system can be an attractive solution for several classes of scalable VoD applications that require QoS guarantee such as movie trailers, news, video clips, and commercials.	aggregate data;electronic system-level design and verification;fits;heuristic (computer science);level design;prototype;quality of service;scalability;systems design;testbed;travis ci;video clip;wireless access point	Leonardo Bidese de Pinho;Claudio Luis de Amorim	2007	Journal of Network and Systems Management	10.1007/s10922-007-9073-x	real-time computing;quality of service;computer science;wireless network;electronic system-level design and verification;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	-11.511145925989466	96.28887481188146	194661

The latter two application areas, traffic safety and efficiency, address the issue of sustainable mobility and are high on the political agendas around the world. This is for good reasons, since traffic volumes are projected to increase with the corresponding risk of increased number of traffic jams, increased emissions and natural resource consumption, and increased number of injured and killed. The International Energy Agency reports for the year 2008 a global vehicle fleet of 800 million vehicles and predicts more than 2 billion vehicles by the year 2050. In a recent World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank report it is stated that, without appropriate action, road injuries are predicted to be the third leading contributor to the global burden of disease. V2Vand V2I-based ubiquitous networking, collectively referred to as V2X communications, is one of the engineering community’s major contributions to address this gloomy prediction. V2V communication refers to communication between road vehicles (cars, trucks, motorcycles, etc.) without involving a central control unit (as the case would be with traditional cellular systems). Current standardization of V2V communication is based on wireless local area network (WLAN) technologies (most notably IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609). The appeal of V2V communication is the potential for low-latency communications, which is important for safety-related applications, and the avoidance of (traditional cellular) coverage problems. V2I communications refer to communication between road users and roadside equipment, again based on short or medium range communication technology. V2I communications have the potential to considerably increase scalability of vehicular networking protocols and to ease coordination between vehicles, through the deployment of a relatively cheap, not necessarily Digital Object Identifier: 10.1109/JPROC.2010.2048154	communications protocol;control unit;identifier;point of view (computer hardware company);scalability;software deployment;traffic exchange;ubiquitous computing;vehicle-to-vehicle	Erik G.

Design issues of location management include MS registration (updating) and call set-up (paging). Previous approaches introduced several network topologies for updating and paging procedures, but most of them focused on a single problem: either updating optimization or paging optimization. In this paper, we design and integrate two mechanisms, distributed temporary location caches (TLCs) and distributed home location registers (HLRs), to reduce database access delay and to decrease network signaling traffic in both updating and paging for low power, low tier micro cellular systems. By using TLCs, our approach can improve the performance of updating and paging in comparison with previous approaches. Experimental results based on our analytic model show that our location management procedures have lower HLR access rate, lower registration cost, and lower call set-up cost than other approaches.	glossary of computer graphics;hidden line removal;hit (internet);locality of reference;mathematical optimization;multi-level cell;multitier architecture;network model;network topology;network traffic control;optimization problem;paging	Kuochen Wang;Jung Huey	1999	Wireless Networks	10.1023/A:1019163414359	real-time computing;cost-effectiveness analysis;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;mobile station;network topology;computer network	Mobile	-10.403842200749715	88.84216552970655	195571

While most of the studies consider the quality of service only from a technical and end-to-end point of view, we try to analyze quality of service as a general gauge of final users' satisfaction. The proposed model allows us to estimate the quality experienced by end users, while offering detailed results regarding the responsibility of the different agents involved in the service provision.

The project includes more than thirty researchers and covers not only the network support but also the enabling technologies. The authors believe that QoS development cannot be done in isolation from the applications to be supported, which must form an integral part of the project. They focus on three application areas: interactive teaching and learning, mobile systems, and virtual reality. They chose applications that stretch network support to its limit. To realize the full potential of these distributed multimedia applications, the underlying network must satisfy all these requirements concurrently. They give a brief overview of their activities to this end and discuss the need for QoS support.	quality of service	Doug Shepherd;Andrew C.

However, support for truly seamless mobility requires more than just routing: every service associated with the mobile user needs to be transferred smoothly to the new access network. In this paper, we will concentrate on the problem of transferring service state (context) at both the link and the IP layers. We propose a method to estimate the best moment in time for transferring context information associated with the mobile user. As one of key issues in the proactive context transfer scheme is accuracy of handover prediction, we suggest and describe a new concept of Forced Handover that can provide very low handover latency. The simulation results and the following discussions show that our scheme is helpful in ensuring seamless mobility, while keeping the number of unnecessary handovers resulting from the proactive nature of the scheme at a controllable level.	access network;ar (unix);authentication;ct scan;interrupt;mathematical optimization;mobile ip;proactive parallel suite;routing;seamless3d;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;smoothing;time-slot interchange	Ha Duong;Arek Dadej;Steven Gordon	2005	Mobile Computing and Communications Review	10.1145/1094549.1094556	loose source routing;real-time computing;imt advanced;computer science;wireless network;mobile station;mobility model;triangular routing;computer security;mobile ip;computer network;access network	Mobile	-10.838083013011902	89.67935090185257	196089

This problem becomes more serious when the packet loss rate (PLR) and the bit error rate (BER) change over time. Most existing solutions focus on either the packet loss problem or the bit error problem. We designed an adaptive multiple description coding (AMDC) scheme with the index assignment (IA) technique to solve these two problems simultaneously. The redundancy is added to AMDC to overcome the packet losses. And the redundancy rate can be precisely controlled to optimize the delivery performance for a given PLR, according to the end-to-end distortion model. Meanwhile, for any given BER, the bit error resilience of the scheme is guaranteed well by further exploiting the added redundancy in AMDC. Simulating results for an i.i.d. Gaussian source show that, the proposed scheme achieved significant improvement for both redundancy control and bit-error resilience simultaneously, comparing with existing solutions.	multiple description coding;public lending right;x.690	Meng Meng Yang;Xuguang Lan;Nanning Zheng	2013	Sig.

Coded caching has been considered as a promising technique to release this burden by providing local caching gain and global caching gain simultaneously. A placement delivery array (PDA) design was formulated to characterize the centralized coded caching schemes. In this paper, the PDA based coded caching design is employed in two aspects. Firstly, we utilize it to characterize the users' priority level. An algorithm to generate a PDA to take users' priority level into consideration is proposed. Secondly, we implement it for wireless video-streaming over wireless network by incorporating rateless codes into it. Further, we establish a test-bed to validate the aforementioned idea. Our results indicate that, the video transmission capability can be significantly improved by exploiting the coded multicasting opportunities created by coded caching scheme, and the effective packet loss recovery can be guaranteed by the rateless transmission. Meanwhile, it is shown that the PDA based coded caching video transmission scheme can be easily modified to support different users' priority level.	algorithm;cache (computing);centralized computing;data recovery;lossy compression;luby transform code;multicast;network congestion;network packet;personal digital assistant;prototype;real-time web;server (computing);streaming media;testbed	Lei Zheng;Ziqi Wang;Qifa Yan;Qingchun Chen;Xiaohu Tang	2016	2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636867	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	-7.74285229594381	99.2156713089489	196165

In the current mobile networks, handover optimisation is done manually on a long timescale. In this paper, we introduce inter-NodeB coordination system and the parameters of user behavior and history data to optimise handover. First, we collect the data of user behavior, analyze the data and find the regular pattern with the help of history data. Then, signals are sent out to inform the eNodeBs along the regular path, so the eNodeBs along the regular path can make the handover preparation previously. When the user is coming, the mobile-phone can be switched to another cell quickly. If the user deviates from the regular path, the handover procedure is handled as traditional. We can use the history data to amend the handover process and make user return to the regular path. From simulation result, the advantage of saving time in handover procedure is significant.	mathematical optimization;mobile phone;simulation	Bo Wang;Xiangming Wen;Wei Zheng;Yong Sun	2010	2010 Asia-Pacific Conference on Wearable Computing Systems	10.1109/APWCS.2010.89	embedded system;cellular network;real-time computing;mobile telephony;network switch;computer science;handover;operating system;coordinate system;mobile computing;soft handover;computer network	HCI	-9.9290734723888	89.93557847812278	196286

69c5b1b3a8b9a4e0d0f2988d3305463e3960f238	incorporating prediction into adaptive streaming algorithms: a qoe perspective		Streaming over the wireless channel is challenging due to rapid fluctuations in available throughput. Encouraged by recent advances in cellular throughput prediction based on radio link metrics, we examine the impact on Quality of Experience (QoE) when using prediction within existing algorithms based on the DASH standard. By design, DASH algorithms estimate available throughput at the application level from chunk rates and then apply some averaging function. We investigate alternatives for modifying these algorithms, by providing the algorithms direct predictions in place of estimates or feeding predictions in place of measurement samples. In addition, we explore different prediction horizons going from one to three chunk durations. Furthermore, we induce different levels of error to ideal prediction values to analyse deterioration in user QoE as a function of average error.  We find that by applying accurate prediction to three algorithms, user QoE can improve up to 55% depending on the algorithm in use. Furthermore having longer horizon positively affects QoE metrics. Accurate predictions have the most significant impact on stall performance by completely eliminating them. Prediction also improves switching behaviour significantly and longer prediction horizons enable a client to promptly reduce quality and avoid stalls when the throughput drops for a relatively long time that can deplete the buffer. For all algorithms, a 3-chunk horizon strikes the best balance between different QoE metrics and, as a result, achieving highest user QoE. While error-induced predictions significantly lower user QoE in certain situations, on average, they provide 15% improvement over DASH algorithms without any prediction.		Darijo Raca;Ahmed H.

The mechanism selects dynamically the best access point among those reachable in the metropolitan areas where MEW operates. The selection policy is based on both the strength of the access point's signal and the traffic on the wireless communication channels. The selected access points are associated with the wireless network adapters available on board of MEW Mobile Sensor devices, thus allowing these devices to reliably and continuously transmit multimedia data streams to a remote storage center for future replay. We have carried out an experimental evaluation of the extended MEW prototype in order to assess its effectiveness in coping with such limitations as scarce wireless communication resources. The results of this evaluation are discussed in this paper and show the adequacy of our approach.	prototype;wireless access point	Vittorio Ghini;Stefano Cacciaguerra;Giorgia Lodi;Fabio Panzieri	2008	Fifth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations (itng 2008)	10.1109/ITNG.2008.129	telecommunications;computer science;operating system;mobile computing;computer security;wireless;computer network;network access point	Mobile	-12.07115441051777	91.65028611208052	196534

Vertical handoffs will commonly be used to pass voice calls to a cellular network when the user roams outside of WLAN radio coverage. Unfortunately, the transition from WLAN hotspot to cellular coverage is often very abrupt and leads to unacceptable call dropping rates. In this paper we propose and investigate the use of explicit WLAN/cellular handoff triggering. A simple Wi-Fi handoff trigger node (HTN) can be installed in the WLAN/cellular transition region, and generates link layer triggers which cause the initiation of the vertical handoff process. A key function provided by the HTN is to significantly reduce the call dropping rate even when there is very little collaboration between the cellular and WLAN hotspot providers. Results are presented which show that the call dropping probability can be dramatically reduced by the use of a handoff trigger node.	database trigger;hierarchical task network;java hotspot virtual machine;mobile phone;port triggering;wireless access point	Pejman Khadivi;Terence D.

1aed696b07a302aae934c1bdc1e1acf8e1a12e10	towards internet scale quality-of-experience measurement with twitter		At present, Quality of Experience (QoE) measurements are accomplished by interrogating users for the perceived quality of a service they just have used. Influenced by many factors and often limited by domain or geographical region, this technique has several drawbacks when a general state of QoE for the internet as a whole is prospected. To achieve such a general metric, we leverage user complaints that we observe in real-time in social media. Such approaches have been successfully applied for the monitoring of specific and single services. We aim to extend existing methods in order to create an overall metric, define an internet wide QoE baseline, monitor changes and hence, provide a context for assessing smaller scale findings against a ground truth. The contribution of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of using social media analysis for generating a meaningful value for quantifying the actual QoE of the internet.	baseline (configuration management);client (computing);elegant degradation;ground truth;internet security;real-time clock;real-time locating system;requirement;sensor;social media;web service	Dennis Kergl;Robert Roedler;Gabi Dreo Rodosek	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-60774-0_8	leverage (finance);internet privacy;the internet;computer science;ground truth;quality of experience;social media	HCI	-10.301774439141772	98.68403464790732	196826

The solution leads to an alternative approach to service provisioning in an ATM network, in which the network offers directly for rent its bandwidth and buffers and users purchase freely resources to meet their desired quality. Users make their decisions based on their own traffic parameters and delay requirements and the network sets prices for those resources. The procedure is iterative in that the network periodically adjusts prices based on monitored user demand, and is decentralized in that only local information is needed for individual users to determine resource requests. We derive network’s adjustment scheme and users’ decision rule and establish their optimality. Since our approach does not require the network to know user traffic and delay parameters, it does not require traffic policing on the part of the network.	atm turbo;bandwidth (signal processing);end-to-end principle;iteration;provisioning;requirement	Steven H.

In addition, classified services based on Diff-Serv (Differentiated Service), MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching),etc., have come into wide use. Today’s Internet environment requires routers to perform control mechanisms in order to guarantee various QoSs. In this paper, we propose a smart buffer management scheme for the Internet router that uses hierarchical priority control with port class and flow level. Furthermore, since the proposed scheme must operate at very high speed, we first propose several design policy for high speed operation and the hardware implementation is performed in VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) code. Implementation results show that the proposed scheme can scale with high-speed link, achieving the maximum rate of 4.0 Gbps even though the conventional 3.5 μm CMOS technology was applied.	cmos;control system;data rate units;differentiated service;differentiated services;display resolution;global communications conference;hardware description language;internet;multiprotocol label switching;pipeline (computing);quality of service;router (computing);telecommunications link;vhdl;vhsic;weighted round robin	Katsuya Minami;Hideki Tode;Koso Murakami	2003		10.1109/GLOCOM.2003.1258836	embedded system;real-time computing;the internet;quality of service;differentiated service;computer science;operating system;hardware description language;computer network	Networks	-5.941215537096951	95.89339073576748	197198

Even if the general Mobile IPv6 protocol performs sufficient in macro environments with non-realtime requirements, seamless mobility demands some more enhanced protocol procedures in between the mobile client and the involved network entities. Limiting the effect of handovers has the potential to considerably improve handover performance in terms of latency and packet loss. This contribution is going to present simulative studies on the performance of a future 4G Hierarchical Mobility Management approach. The demonstrated simulation scenarios comprises 3 independent access domains, twelve access routers, and up to 72 mobile clients that communicate in accordance with the popular IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN standard, as one of the possible wireless access networks in a future All-IP network infrastructure.	access network;entity;internet protocol suite;mobile ip;mobile device;network packet;real-time computing;requirement;seamless3d;simulation	Norbert Jordan;Alexander Poropatich;Peter Reichl	2007	Sixth International Conference on Networking (ICN'07)	10.1109/ICN.2007.83	wimax;communications protocol;cellular network;the internet;ground-penetrating radar;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;mobile device;mobility model;packet loss;mobile computing;computer security;digital video broadcasting;transport layer;mobile ip;computer network	Mobile	-12.829459897963986	90.47226187238708	197205

Furthermore, services in the telecommunication domain are subject to specific requirements such as support for end-to-end communication sessions and mechanisms for service interaction across technological borders including telecom, enterprise and Internet services. The presented approach uses a technology-agnostic core composition function, which is comprised of high-level abstraction in the description of heterogeneous services, constraint-based dynamic service selection and step-by-step instantiation of abstract composite application models. In order to better support telecommunication services, these concepts were combined with support for sessions, integration with IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) and support for legacy telecommunication technologies such as Intelligent Networks (IN) [1]. The presented composition approach has become part of products and solutions. This paper reports our experiences regarding the applicability of the technology, efficiency of the composite service development and performance of services composed using this approach.	abstraction layer;ajax (programming);aspect-oriented programming;business logic;composite application;end-to-end principle;enterprise software;essence;event-driven programming;graphical user interface;high- and low-level;ip multimedia subsystem;intelligent network;inter-domain;programming paradigm;random access;real life;requirement;soap;scalability;separation of concerns;service composability principle;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented modeling;software deployment;universal instantiation;web 2.0;web service	Jörg Niemöller;Eugen Freiter;Konstantinos Vandikas;Raphaël Quinet;Roman Levenshteyn;Ioannis Fikouras	2010	2010 Fourth International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies	10.1109/NGMAST.2010.19	intelligent network;telecommunications;differentiated service;computer science;service delivery framework;operating system;service design;distributed computing;world wide web;ip multimedia subsystem;computer network	HPC	-15.769440683401298	92.52732197887046	197270

Site Multi-homing by IPv6 Intermediation-SHIM6 is a proposal presented in IETF to provide multi-homing support in IPv6 based networks. Although initially it was intended for static networks but recently it has been tested that the mobility performance of SHIM6 is much better than the currently adopted mobility service in Internet-Mobile IPv6. Failure detection and recovery in SHIM6 is performed through ReAchability (REAP) protocol. Due to the inherent flaws in MIPv6, some new protocols/techniques have been tested which improve the overall mobility performance in IPv6 networks. In this paper, we present a mechanism for providing a “make before break” mobility service. We call our proposed mechanism SHIM6 Assisted Mobility Scheme (SAMS) as it provides both mobility and multi-homing support. We implemented LinSHIM6 with our proposed intelligent switching in wireless environment and present the results. We compare SAMS with REAP for multiple locator switching scenarios. The comparison is made in terms of packet loss, jitter, throughput and data transferred. Through experiments, we show that the percentage packet loss during switching reduces from 24.71% to 1.72% when SAMS is used instead of REAP.	database trigger;experiment;intelligent network;missile guidance;mobile ip;mobile app;multiple homing;network packet;online locator service;reachability;real-time clock;site multihoming by ipv6 intermediation;switch;switching time;testbed;throughput	M.

These aspects have to be considered speci""""cally for distributed multimedia applications, typically involving large amounts of data and speci""""c QoS requirements. This article presents concepts and experiences concerning adaptive services for asynchronous multimedia transmission in mobile environments. We describe two di!erent approaches to solve the problems of adaptation to variable network QoS using generic mechanisms. The """"rst approach takes advantage of a mobile queuing service and is based on our former work on a support platform for mobile computing (see Schill and KuK mmel. Mobile Computing Special Issue of Distributed Systems Engineering Journal 1995; 128}41; Schill et al. Proceedings of IMC 96 Workshop on Information Visualization and Mobile Computing. Zentrum fuK r graphische Datenverarbeitung, February 1996). The second approach uses the mobile agent paradigm in the context of an application partitioning model to gain #exibility and maintainability (see Schill et al. In: Papaioannou, Minar, editors, Proceedings. Mobile Agents in the Context of Competition and Cooperation (MAC3), a workshop at Autonomous Agents '99, 1999. p. 34}41.). Both approaches exploit software-based conversion to adapt multimedia data according to bandwidth availability. Decoupling of communication peers with automatic noti""""cations about communication actions helps to address disconnection problems. ( 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The survival of this concept into the next century largely depends on the deployment of interactive multimedia services which in turn must be supported by an adequate network infrastructure. In this paper a staged service specification and development philosophy is proposed which blends a multimedia oriented IN service architecture with B-ISDN transport capabilities. The outstanding feature regarding this approach is that, while it originates from the existing narrowband single media reality, it additionally provides detailed evolutionary steps towards future services running over the emerging high speed public networks. An enhanced IN/B-ISDN architecture is used as the starting point for the provision of core multimedia characteristics such as call/connection separation and co-ordination of multiple calls within a session. Consequently, the way by which the service prose description can serve as a means for the decomposition of a multimedia service into discrete functional stages is presented. The available options regarding the distribution of the identified functionality among the IN network nodes are examined next, followed by the definition of service specific information flows across the various interfaces. The results from this specification work are used for the production of a formal service description in SDL. This description is mapped to a library of object oriented service building blocks utilised by a service creation environment for the production of the actual service logic program. Selected parts of new multimedia services (Video on Demand) as well as existing multimedia services, originally targeted at TCP/IP environments (Video Conference), are presented in order to demonstrate an implementation viewpoint with respect to the proposed methodology. Finally, the advantages of the specification and design approach discussed in this paper are justified through comparison to other existing approaches in the same field.	integrated services digital network;intelligent network;internet protocol suite;logic programming;simple directmedia layer;software deployment;stepwise regression;usability	George N.

Current methods of QoS provisioning have either scalability concerns or cannot guarantee end-to-end delay with acceptable packet loss unless bandwidth is over-provisioned. While low jitter guarantee is required for streaming applications, maximum end-to-end delay is also required for VoIP and interactive games. We propose, analyze the stability and demonstrate the viability of three combined rate and end-to-end delay controls. The stability analysis is done on a fluid network model with greedy flows showing that all controls are globally asymptotically stable without information time lags and one of them is also globally asymptotically stable with arbitrary time lags; however it substantivally under-utilizes the network. Another control, which numerically demonstrates stability with arbitrary time lags, is implemented in edge and core routers of our WAN-in-Lab with long haul links. The prototype implementation confirms its viability and its advantage over the Differentiated Service architecture. The viability of the two other controls is shown by detailed NS2 packet-based simulations of an eight-node real core network.	differentiated service;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;greedy algorithm;network model;network packet;numerical analysis;prototype;provisioning;quality of service;scalability;simulation	Zvi Rosberg;Fariza Sabrina;Sheldon Dealy;John Matthews;Craig Russell	2009	2009 17th International Workshop on Quality of Service	10.1109/IWQoS.2009.5201400	core router;von neumann stability analysis;real-time computing;the internet;core network;jitter;quality of service;differentiated service;computer science;processing delay;network model;end-to-end delay;voice over ip;distributed computing;transmission delay;packet loss;bandwidth;computer network	Networks	-5.924500527531519	95.59756340492058	198196

The proposed algorithm, Loss Concentration based controlled Delay (LC-Codel), maintains low queuing delay which is essential for video telephony, while using loss concentration to improve video QoE.

Finally, the simulation experiments show that, the model can reach the purpose of optimizing traffic management.	active directory rights management services;algorithm;experiment;fairness measure;game theory;ips panel;mathematical optimization;network packet;network traffic control;optimization problem;peer-to-peer;simulation	Chunzhi Wang;Shuping Wang;Hui Xu;Hongwei Chen	2014	JCP	10.4304/jcp.9.6.1478-1483	traffic generation model;game theory;active traffic management;network traffic control;simulation;computer science;peer-to-peer;traffic shaping;computer security	Metrics	-8.059930601656612	94.74366745422206	198614

However, deploying security over satellite networks has specific issues caused either by the characteristic of the satellite link such as the long end-to-end delay and higher bit error rates, or by some other protocols typically and frequently used in satellite networks, such as Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs) or IP Multicast to name a few of them. This paper first outlines and analyses these security issues with broadband satellite communication, such as issues with PEPs and IPsec anti-replay protection. It then investigates and outlines solutions to this kind of issues, which are deployable today. Finally it points to some research topic in this area, which needs future work before becoming deployable.	anti-replay;bit error rate;communications satellite;end-to-end principle;ipsec;multicast	Wolfgang Fritsche	2011	2011 Australasian Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ATNAC)	10.1109/ATNAC.2011.6096657	telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-8.506196457299302	91.3052839315303	198780

At present, Adobe's Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol (RTMFP) is widely used in video transmission. In order to improve the video transmission speed, RTMFP adopts P2P technology. P2P technology brings a new question about traffic locality. This paper is verified that the cross-domain traffic is more than the local traffic through experiments, and at last, the paper introduces some methods to achieve traffic locality.	algorithm;digital video;experiment;internet;locality of reference;mathematical optimization;peer-to-peer;real-time transcription;streaming media	Miaoxin Xu;Zhijie Han	2015	2015 Third International Conference on Advanced Cloud and Big Data	10.1109/CBD.2015.52	real time streaming protocol;internet traffic;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer network	Embedded	-10.716601000829321	95.98151625556086	198863
08f128a630314d955ac07925d0b1b65cca2bdb4a	the cost of free spectrum	wireless service competition;spectrum policy;network pricing	There has been growing interest in increasing the amount of wireless spectrum available for unlicensed access, especially lower frequency “prime” spectrum which could be used to offer wide area coverage similar to licensed cellular providers. While this additional unlicensed spectrum allows for market expansion, it also influences competition among providers and can increase congestion (interference) among consumers of wireless services. We study the value (social welfare and consumer surplus) obtained by adding unlicensed spectrum to an existing allocation of licensed spectrum among incumbent service providers. We assume populations of customers who choose a provider based on minimum delivered price, given by the weighted sum of the price of the service and a congestion cost, which depends on the number of subscribers in a band. We consider both models in which this weighting is homogeneous across the customer population and where the weighting is heterogeneous, reflecting customers preference for a high or low class of service. For the models considered, we find that the social welfare depends on the amount of additional unlicensed spectrum, and can actually decrease over a significant range of unlicensed bandwidths. Furthermore, in a heterogeneous model introducing unlicensed spectrum can also reduce consumer welfare.	bandwidth (signal processing);class of service;interference (communication);network congestion;population;weight function	Thanh Nguyen;Hang Zhou;Randall Berry;Michael L.

By deploying segment based caching-enabled switch, MOVi+ increases the opportunity which reflects the pairing chances among nodes. MOVi+ also evaluates the merit of pre-diffusion-aware scheduling to utilize the time varying opportunity as much as possible. We shows that MOVi+ can eventually service more number of mobile nodes than MOVi with lower segment missing ratio, better opportunity usage, and playout continuity.	playout;scheduling (computing);scott continuity	Hyun Young Lee;Jae-Yong Yoo;JongWon Kim	2013	2013 IEEE 10th Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2013.6488569	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;telecommunications service;operating system;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	-6.9621316699937585	97.19576572768159	198999

In this work we evaluate the performance of high-resolution video over multi-hop mesh networks and we propose a suitable GOP size for encoding video to be streamed, based on traffic conditions to minimize the loss of quality. Experiments were carried out in a wireless mesh network planned for real testing within a 1500m2 area of the main UFAM campus, using the IEEE 802.11a and 802.11n network standards.	group of pictures;image resolution;internet protocol suite;mesh networking;quality of service;streaming media;wireless mesh network	Rafael Sousa;Edjair de Souza Mota;Edson Nascimento Silva;Kleverson Santana Paixao;Bruno G.

Specifically, it has been used to encode voice for multimedia services over packet-switching networks including IP, ATM, Frame Relay, as well as over mobile communications networks. Due to the near toll quality [3] of the G.723.1 speech coder, it is ideal for real-time voice communications over private and local area networks (LANs) where packet loss is minimal. However, over wide area networks (WANs), global area networks (GANs), and mobile communications networks, congestion is often severe and increasing rates of packet loss may generate significant distortions in output speech quality if unremedied. This paper describes a lost frame recovery technique for reconstructing lost packets at the speech decoding system. For packet loss rates up to 15%, simulation results show a substantial improvement in output speech quality over the current strategy [1] provided for the G.723.1 speech coder, at the price of increasing algorithmic delay.	atm turbo;automatic sounding;distortion;encode;error concealment;frame relay;g.723.1;linear interpolation;network congestion;network packet;packet switching;real-time clock;simulation;speech coding;speech synthesis;telecommunications network	Grant Ho;Suat Yeldener;M.

However, it can also be considered as an opportunity for new ways of service provisioning. On the one hand, P2P concepts allow a more efficient usage of existing platform resources through relying on existing infrastructure including even the customer equipment and thus provide a cheap service platform. On the other hand, P2P technology brings new business opportunities through extending the service portfolio to user provided services and to ubiquitous environments. Along these lines, we outline in this paper the requirements and building blocks for a P2P based service platform for mobile environments. In addition to P2P lookup and information distribution, these building blocks include reliability, controllability, bootstrapping, reputation management, which address operator specific requirements in particular. Mobile networks pose severe challenges to a P2P service platform in terms of heterogeneous devices and access connections and frequent user joins and leaves. We present a hierarchical P2P system as a core component for a P2P service platform addressing those problems	bootstrapping (compilers);lookup table;peer-to-peer;provisioning;reputation management;requirement	Wolfgang Kellerer;Zoran Despotovic;Maximilian Michel;Quirin Hofstätter;Stefan Zöls	2007	2007 International Symposium on Applications and the Internet Workshops	10.1109/SAINT-W.2007.102	cellular network;mobile search;mobile web;computer science;operating system;peer-to-peer;distributed computing;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-14.793654636188993	90.16394212114676	199355

The main drawback of the basic MPLS-TE model is that it operates at an aggregate level and so it is unaware of traffic classes. DiffServ-aware MPLS-TE (DS- TE) refines the MPLS-TE model by allowing bandwidth reservations to be carried out on a per-class basis. The result is the ability to give strict QoS guarantees while optimizing the use of network resources. Bandwidth constraints models play a key role in the DS-TE architecture, since they establish how bandwidth is distributed among different classes. In this paper, we first present a new bandwidth constraints model, called G-RDM. Then, we compare the performance of G-RDM with respect to MAM and RDM in different scenarios by means of an analytical model based on Markov-chains. The results show that G-RDM, joining the best features of MAM and RDM, allows to improve their performance.	aggregate data;differentiated services;end-to-end principle;internet access;layer 2 mpls vpn;markov chain;multiprotocol label switching;quality of service;test engineer	Davide Adami;Christian Callegari;Stefano Giordano;Michele Pagano;Michela Toninelli	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.470	multiprotocol label switching;markov chain;network traffic control;index term;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;markov process;traffic shaping;computer security;statistics;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	DB	-5.926325597743399	94.62057986060472	199652
