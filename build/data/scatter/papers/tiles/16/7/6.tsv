Four new ranking methods are introduced in this paper. Dierent probability models for pairwise contests between tournament participants are considered. We consider the case in which there are multiple tournaments but not all players compete in all tournaments. Guidelines are provided for selecting a ranking method given some foreknowledge of the form of the distributions of the participants' strengths. Ó 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Two frequently-used representations are occupancy grid maps, which only model metric information, and object-based world models, which only model object attributes. Many tasks represent space in just one of these two ways; however, because objects must be physically grounded in metric space, these two distinct layers of representation are fundamentally linked. We develop an approach that maintains these two sources of spatial information separately, and combines them on demand. We illustrate the utility and necessity of combining such information through applying our approach to a collection of motivating examples.	domain-driven design;geographic information system;image scaling;linker (computing);map;mobile robot;object-based language;octree;state space	Lawson L.

3e6bf204cf83c731a14ba00fc139c34686b940e3	a compound real option and ahp methodology for evaluating ict business alternatives	analytic hierarchy process;net present value;multicriteria decision making;investments analysis;decision maker;decision analysis;information and communication technology;real options;business case;investment analysis;real option;information and communication technologies;broadband technology;cost benefit analysis	After the liberalization of information and communication technology (ICT) markets many potential providers have appeared. Thus, business complexity, for ICT decision makers, has increased. In this paper, we focus on the problem of selecting the optimal business evolution path for ICT, focusing on the broadband technology (BT) field. Traditional quantitative cost–benefits analysis, such as net present value (NPV), is by no means sufficient for capturing the complexity of the problem in its entire. Researchers suggest the real options (ROs) for valuating ICT investments. However, RO models are strictly quantitative and very often ICT investments may also contain qualitative factors, which cannot be quantified in monetary terms. In addition, ROs analysis itself brings to the ‘‘surface” some factors that can be more efficiently treated qualitatively. We combine the ROs and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) into a common decision analysis framework providing an integrated multicriteria model, called ROAHP, for prioritizing ICT business alternatives. The proposed model is applied to a real life BT business case, showing how it can be formulated and solved. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

a487fc7e7ca35f12280f46de504ef2ee7599c9d5	learning by networked agents under partial information		In many scenarios of interest, agents may only have access to partial information about an unknown model or target vector. Each agent may be sensing only a subset of the entries of a global target vector, and the number of these entries can be different across the agents. If each of the agents were to solve an inference task independently of the other agents, then they would not benefit from neighboring agents that may be sensing similar entries. This work develops cooperative distributed techniques that enable agents to cooperate even when their interactions are limited to exchanging estimates of select few entries. In the proposed strategies, agents are only required to share estimates of their common entries, which results in a significant reduction in communication overhead. Simulations show that the proposed approach improves both the performance of individual agents and the entire network through cooperation.	computer simulation;cooperative multitasking;interaction;overhead (computing)	Chung-Kai Yu;Ali H.

However, the quality issues of identity information make this task non-trivial. Various heuristic based systems have been developed to tackle the identity matching problem. However, deploying such systems may require special expertise in system configuration and customization for optimal system performance. In this paper, we propose an alternative system called the Arizona IDMatcher. The system relies on a machine learning algorithm to automatically generate a decision model for identity matching. Such a system requires minimal human configuration effort. Experiments show that the Arizona IDMatcher is very efficient in detecting matching identity records. Compared to IBM Identity Resolution (a commercial, heuristic-based system), the Arizona IDMatcher achieves better recall and overall F-measures in identifying matching identities in two large-scale real-world datasets.	algorithm;experiment;heuristic;machine learning;sensor;system configuration	Guanghui Wang;Siddharth Kaza;Shailesh Joshi;Kris Chang;Homa Atabakhsh;Hsinchun Chen	2007	2007 IEEE Intelligence and Security Informatics	10.1109/ISI.2007.379477	decision model;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;information management;information technology;computer security;statistics	AI	-12.506365636769978	-10.372872280035352	52565

Quantitative assessment of integrated, multimedia models that simulate hundreds of sites, spanning multiple geographical and ecological regions, will ultimately require a comparative approach using several techniques, coupled with sufficient computational power. The Framework for Risk Analysis in Multimedia Environmental Systems – Multimedia, Multipathway, and Multireceptor Risk Assessment (FRAMES-3MRA) is an important software model being developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for use in risk assessment of hazardous waste management facilities. The 3MRA modeling system includes a set of 17 science modules that collectively simulate release, fate and transport, exposure, and risk associated with hazardous contaminants disposed of in land-based waste management units (WMU). The 3MRA model encompasses 966 multi-dimensional input variables, over 185 of which are explicitly stochastic. Design of SuperMUSE, a 215 GHz PC-based, Windows-based Supercomputer for Model Uncertainty and Sensitivity Evaluation is described. Developed for 3MRA and extendable to other computer models, an accompanying platform-independent, Java-based parallel processing software toolset is also discussed. For 3MRA, comparison of stand-alone PC versus SuperMUSE simulation executions showed a parallel computing overhead of only 0.57 seconds/simulation, a relative cost increase of 0.7% over average model runtime. Parallel computing software tools represent a critical aspect of exploiting the capabilities of such modeling systems. The Java toolset developed here readily handled machine and job management tasks over the Windows cluster, and is currently capable of completing over 3 million 3MRA model simulations per month on SuperMUSE. Preliminary work is reported for an example uncertainty analysis of Benzene disposal that describes the relative importance of various exposure pathways in driving risk levels for ecological receptors and human health. Incorporating landfills, waste piles, aerated tanks, surface impoundments, and land application units, the site-based data used in the analysis included 201 facilities across the United States representing 419 site-WMU combinations.

In the first phase, different geographic criteria are determined based on existing literature, and data are gathered using GIS. On equal criteria weighing, alternative locations are determined using GIS in the second phase. In the third phase, the identified criteria are weighted using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) by various stakeholders of potential ecotourism sites. In the fourth phase, the PROMETHEE method is applied to determine the best alternative based on the weighted criteria.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnA framework including four sequential steps is proposed. Using real data from the Black Sea region in Turkey, the authors test the applicability of the evaluation approach and compare the best alternative obtained by the proposed method for nine cities in the region. Consequently, west of Sinop, east of Artvin and south of the Black Sea region are determined as very suitable locations for ecotourism.rnrnrnrnrnResearch limitations/implicationsrnrnrnrnrnThe first limitation of the study is considered the number of included criteria. Another limitation is the use of deterministic parameters that do not cope with uncertainty. Further research can be conducted for determining the optimum locations for different types of tourism, e.g. religion tourism, hunting tourism and golf tourism, for effective tourism planning.rnrnrnrnrnPractical implicationsrnrnrnrnrnThe proposed approach can be applied to all area that cover the considered criteria. The approach has been tested in the Black Sea region (nine cities) in Turkey.rnrnrnrnrnSocial implicationsrnrnrnrnrnUsing the proposed approach, decision-makers can determine locations where environmentally responsible travel to natural areas to enjoy and appreciate nature that promotes conservation have a low visitor impact and provide for beneficially active socioeconomic involvement of local individuals.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnTo the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first study which applies a GIS-based multi-criteria decision-making approach for ecotourism site selection.	decision analysis;geographic information system	Cihan Çetinkaya;Mehmet Kabak;Mehmet Erbas;Eren Özceylan	2018	Kybernetes	10.1108/K-10-2017-0392	management science;multiple-criteria decision analysis;geographic information system;computer science;visitor pattern;analytic hierarchy process;tourism;ecotourism;site selection	Theory	-12.232382054094915	-22.967668970877973	52988

Many techniques have been devised for this problem, and coordinated teamwork has been demonstrated even in highly dynamic and adversarial environments. A key assumption of these techniques, though, is that the team members are developed together as a whole. In many multiagent scenarios, this assumption is violated. We study the problem of coordination in impromptu teams, where a team is composed of independent agents each unknown to the others. The team members have their own skills, models, strategies, and coordination mechanisms, and no external organization is imposed upon them. In particular, we propose two techniques, one adaptive and one predictive, for coordinating a single agent that joins an unknown team of existing agents. We experimentally evaluate these mechanisms in the robot soccer domain, while introducing useful baselines for evaluating the performance of impromptu teams. We show some encouraging success while demonstrating this is a very fertile area of research.	adversary (cryptography);agent-based model;autonomous agent;autonomous robot;experiment;impromptu;multi-agent system	Michael H.

In addition, the opinion of the little scale group was obtained via the weight trial calculation of the decision maker in the cluster group. Following that, the approach of finding the core decision maker in the little scale group was suggested. In the last, the large scale group opinion was obtained via the aggregating cluster groups based on the weight trial calculation of the little scale group.	aggregate data;bifurcation theory	Jian Jun Zhu;Qiang Di	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811646	decision-making;probability density function;group decision-making;uncertainty;decision theory;sorting;data mining;correlation;statistics	Robotics	-7.028730386751163	-20.04312509536078	53147

In the practical scenario, there may be a large number of agents, and the interactions between agents may be sparse and unfixed. In this paper, we study the coordination problems and stochastic rewards under the social learning framework where there are a group of agents and each agent behaves independently and interacts with another agent randomly chosen from the group. We are looking for a learning technique that makes all agents learn a consistent optimal policy in a two agents game with pathology of coordination problems or stochastic rewards under such a framework. A new algorithm named Decentralized concurrent learning and cooperative policy exploration (DCL-CPE) is contributed, which possesses the ability to overcome the coordination problems and the stochastic rewards via local interaction under the social learning framework. Empirical results for several cooperative games are presented to show the superiority of our algorithm.	algorithm;constant phase element;interaction;multi-agent system;randomness;sparse matrix	Chi Wang;Xin Chen	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2017.8122839	automation;machine learning;social learning;nash equilibrium;artificial intelligence;reinforcement;computer science;convergence (routing);multi-agent system	AI	-16.333097181952574	-11.936820666494869	53368

They may simply be unable to process vast amounts of information available and to make a satisfactory decision. Interactive decision aids, are a potential solution to this problem. Decision aids that filter a very large set of alternatives based on initial decision-maker preferences may eliminate potentially good alternatives early in the decision process, lead to a poor quality consideration set, and possibly negatively impact decision quality. The decision aid we propose here modifies the filtration criteria provided and thus, allows decision makers to reconsider selected alternatives they initially eliminated. We propose a model of such a decision aid, give an overview of its different configurations, and provide an illustrative example of use in the apartment selection decision problem. We also hypothesize about the impact of the proposed decision aid on decision quality and consideration set size and quality. We conclude the paper with an overview of potential directions for future research and a discussion of benefits of application of preference relaxation.	decision problem;decision quality;e-commerce;game-maker;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;preference learning	Maciej Dabrowski;Thomas Acton	2010	International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5583988	e-commerce;decision-making;r-cast;optimal decision;influence diagram;decision support system;decision analysis;decision field theory;decision engineering;computer science;knowledge management;decision tree;decision problem;decision rule;management science;evidential reasoning approach;evidential decision theory;business decision mapping	EDA	-6.787837195432196	-13.952258011144977	53428
807e2de6cd6031ce9c58fb190d59443536cff2c6	a fuzzy decision support system for credit scoring	credit scoring;topsis;fuzzy ahp;fico;article	Credit score is a creditworthiness index, which enables the lender (bank and credit card companies) to evaluate its own risk exposure toward a particular potential customer. There are several credit scoring methods available in the literature, but one that is widely used is the FICO method. This method provides a score ranging from 300 to 850 as a fast filter for high-volume complex credit decisions. However, it falls short in the aspect of a decision support system where revised scoring can be achieved to reflect the borrower’s strength and weakness in each scoring dimension, as well as the possible trade-offs made to maintain one’s lending risk. Hence, this study discusses and develops a decision support tool for credit score model based on multi-criteria decision-making principles. In the proposed methodology, criteria weights are generated by fuzzy AHP. Fuzzy linguistic theory is applied in AHP to describe the uncertainties and vagueness arising from human subjectivity in decision making. Finally, drawing from the risk distance function, TOPSIS is used to rank the alternatives based on the least risk exposure. A sensitivity analysis is also demonstrated by the proposed fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS method.	decision support system;vagueness	Joshua Ignatius;Adel Hatami-Marbini;Amirah Rahman;Lalitha Dhamotharan;Pegah Khoshnevis	2016	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-016-2592-1	topsis;actuarial science;data mining	Web+IR	-4.887499814002544	-16.69798330149723	53547

The intent of this study is to compare the use of the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and fuzzy AHP for decisions surrounding the early stages of construction projects based on risk and reliability measures. Financial risk is especially high during the early design stages of a project due to the unknown obstacles that will follow. The case study uses the selection of a project delivery method as an example, and provides a sample project to highlight the project-specific variability of the multi-criteria decision analysis.

Although a number of studies have focused on performance evaluation of power distribution units, this sort of studies are rare in Iran. This paper proposes an integrated slack-based measure (ISBM) approach to measure both technical efficiency and technical effectiveness of Iranianu0027s power distribution units. The proposed SBM-DEA model represents both non-storable features of power distribution industry and production technologies in a unified framework. The proposed approach not only measures technical efficiency and effectiveness of power distribution units, but also estimates overall efficiency of distribution units.

Due to various possible combinations of plant building blocks and because each plant is designed as a uniquely customised system, the complexity of these plants can be enormous. Hence, the decisions to be taken within the planning process very often exceed human cognitive limits. Therefore, this paper describes a decision supporting approach based on discrete event simulation, which enables the planner to model, emulate, simulate, and animate the plant processes. This in turn facilitates exact forecasts of the attainable performance. Based on the proposition of a generic system architecture for this decision support system (DSS), we provide possible solutions for processing of control system orders and task handling in the simulation environment. These mechanisms have been implemented and validated. This article describes a case study of the designed DSS within the plant planning process at a large German kitchen manufacturer. Finally, we discuss the opportunities arising from this approach as well as its future potential.	bottleneck (software);chart;complex system;control system;decision support system;emulator;inferring horizontal gene transfer;material flow;microsoft outlook for mac;planning;real life;simulation;sorting;space–time tradeoff;stacking;systems architecture;throughput;virtual machine	Robert Schöch;Susanne Schmid;Christian Hillbrand;Ruth Fleisch	2013	IJSPM	10.1504/IJSPM.2013.057541	emulation;simulation;decision support system;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;artificial intelligence;operations management;discrete event simulation;process modeling	Robotics	-17.277077753967774	-19.74414955619574	54767

Unlike those studies, we examined influence of social structures on knowledge acquired by societies using computer simulations. We compared four types of social networks, namely regular, random, small world, and scale-free networks. When individual differences and the principle of homophily (i.e., people who have similar beliefs tend to have close relationships with each other) exist in societies, the societies would acquire pareto-optimal knowledge. We also investigated influences of highly connected individuals on knowledge acquired by societies. The results inarguably indicate that highly connected individuals play important roles in social learning, setting the standards for what type of knowledge to be acquired by societies.	cognitive science;computer simulation;emoticon;heuristic;interaction;knowledge acquisition;pareto efficiency;programming paradigm;randomness;self-organization;social network;social structure;unsupervised learning	Toshihiko Matsuka;Hidehito Honda	2014	2014 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889968	computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;machine learning;complex network;social network	AI	-16.0006437838018	-15.487894846090773	55884
d535fc23505f1e0a4a820fb9aee5f4ed990044a9	coevolving nonlinear voter model with triadic closure		We study a nonlinear coevolving voter model with triadic closure local rewiring. We find three phases with different topological properties and configuration in the steady state: absorbing consensus phase with a single component, absorbing fragmented phase with two components in opposite consensus states, and a dynamically active shattered phase with many isolated nodes. This shattered phase, which does not exist for a coevolving model with global rewiring, has a lifetime that scale exponentially with system size. We characterize the transitions between these phases in terms of the size of the largest cluster, the number of clusters, and the magnetization. Our analysis provides a possible solution to reproduce isolated parts in adaptive networks and high clustering widely observed in social systems. Introduction. – Network dynamics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] often refers to the dynamics of the network creation or evolution, but also to the dynamics on the network, where the dynamics of the states of the nodes is affected by the topological structure of a fixed underlying network. However, the structure of the network among interacting agents evolves dynamically in response to the state of the nodes. Therefore, dynamics of and on the network are dynamically coupled processes occurring in comparable time scales. The coupling of these processes has been referred as Coevolution of node states and network structure [6, 7]. In order to understand this coevolutionary dynamics of complex systems, there have been several studies which incorporate both the change of networks and the dynamical processes on networks [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Coevolutionary dynamics has been applied in a variety of different fields ranging form classical spin models [12, 13], opinion formation [8, 10, 14], game theory [7]and epidemic spreading [9, 15, 16, 17], to cultural dynamics [18, 19, 20, 21], and ecological interactions [22, 23]. A prototype coevolving model is the Coevolution Voter Model (CVM) combining the voter model and the change of a network by rewiring links [8, 10]. In the original voter (a)tomasz.raducha@fuw.edu.pl (b)maxi@ifisc.uib-csic.es model [24, 25, 26], a node can be in one of two states, called up and down. At each step, each node adopts the state of one of its neighbors chosen randomly. Adding link rewiring to the original voter model, a coevolving voter model was addressed [8, 10]. In a coevolving voter model, in addition to node’s dynamics following the voter model, the links in a network can be updated. In a typical CVM, a global rewiring of links is adopted for the sake of simplicity, meaning that a newly connected node is chosen randomly out of all nodes in a whole network. The coevolving voter model shows a generic absorbing phase transition between a connected and fragmented network [8]. However, the global rewiring might be unrealistic since there should be some limitation of the range of searching for a node to be connected. Many observations indicate that a link rewiring in networks is mainly implemented by the process of triadic closure, i.e. the tendency that nodes search for new contacts through existing neighbors [27, 28, 29]. In this regard, the effect of triadic closure was analyzed in many models of social dynamics [29, 30, 31, 32]. CVM with rewiring by triadic closure was also studied [33] to describe the community structure of an online society. Triadic closure gives rise to a shattering phase [34]where many lonely nodes separate from a large connected component.

5c51df9aa80083c43e7bbd763e2d13a40edd54e0	frugal preference formation		Most theories explaining how animals form preferences for their actions agree upon a basic outline: animals discover what is preferable through interactions with the world, store this information in memory, and recall it to help them decide what to do in a new situation. However, no single theory currently explains both how preferences are learned, and how they are recalled in a way that is compatible with empirical data. We advance precisely such a proposal in the form of a stochastic choice model where the decision agent learns what to do based on scale-free comparisons between options it observes in the world and at each decision instance recalls a subset of these comparison experiences in a manner that minimizes the metabolic costs of memory recall. In simulation, this model makes qualitatively accurate predictions connecting agent choices with various dynamic choice correlates documented in the literature on choice process models.	choice modelling;interaction;simulation;theory	Nisheeth Srivastava;Paul R.

With the exception of simplistic, single-domain scenarios, most computational models are quickly overwhelmed with the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios. In this paper, we apply intent-driven modeling to a complex, real-world scenario. By mapping actors' intentions to their beliefs and goals, we are able to explain their actions and propose predictions of future actions. Specifically, we look at ways to help understand and explain complex group behaviors during epidemics in relation to national borders. Using an intent-driven socio-cultural behavioral model implemented with the help of Bayesian Knowledge Bases (BKBs), we explore the actions and reactions of actors in an epidemic setting, providing insight into behaviors affecting border security. Using these tools, we are able to employ dynamic, multi-domain modeling to explain the decisions and actions taken by actors in the scenario. We validate our methodology by modeling and analyzing migration behaviors during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Mexico.	algorithm;behavioral modeling;computation;computational model;computational social science;cross-validation (statistics);execution unit;population;ripple effect;social network;social system	Eunice E.

Therefore, farmers in a region are often influenced by similar circumstances, and this can create a coordinated response for pest control that is effective at a landscape scale. This coordinated response is not intentional, but is an emergent property of the system. We propose a framework for understanding the intrinsic feedback mechanisms between the actions of humans and the dynamics of pest populations and demonstrate this framework using the European corn borer, a serious pest in maize crops. We link a model of the European corn borer and a parasite in a landscape with a model that simulates the decisions of individual farmers on what type of maize to grow. Farmers chose whether to grow Bt-maize, which is toxic to the corn borer, or conventional maize for which the seed is cheaper. The problem is akin to the snow-drift problem in game theory; that is to say, if enough farmers choose to grow Bt maize then because the pest is suppressed an individual may benefit from growing conventional maize. We show that the communication network between farmers' and their perceptions of profit and loss affects landscape scale patterns in pest dynamics. We found that although adoption of Bt maize often brings increased financial returns, these rewards oscillate in response to the prevalence of pests.	agricultural crops;avian crop;corn oil;emergence;game theory;parasites;plague;population;rewards;sensorineural hearing loss (disorder);telecommunications network;threat (computer)	Alice E.

94ced313ef5728de06b4a179ae99ca8d4f9e2b82	integrating experts' weights generated dynamically into the consensus reaching process and its applications in managing non-cooperative behaviors		Article history: Received 12 August 2015 Received in revised form 15 December 2015 Accepted 5 January 2016 Available online xxxx The consensus reaching process (CRP) is a dynamic and iterative process for improving the consensus level among experts in group decision making. A large number of non-cooperative behaviors exist in the CRP. For example, some experts will express their opinions dishonestly or refuse to change their opinions to further their own interests. In this study, we propose a novel consensus framework for managing non-cooperative behaviors. In the proposed framework, a self-managementmechanism to generate experts' weights dynamically is presented and then integrated into the CRP. This self-management mechanism is based on multi-attribute mutual evaluation matrices (MMEMs). During the CRP, the experts can provide and update their MMEMs regarding the experts' performances (e.g., professional skill, cooperation, and fairness), and the experts'weights are dynamically derived from the MMEMs. Detailed simulation experiments and comparison analysis are presented to justify the validity of the proposed consensus framework in managing the non-cooperative behaviors. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Two types of metacognitive agent were developed and compared with a non-metacognitive agent and two fixed-strategy agents. The first type of metacognitive agent (opponent perspective) takes the perspective of the opponent to anticipate the opponent's future actions and respond accordingly. The other metacognitive agent (modeler) predicts the opponent's next move based on the previous moves of the agent and the opponent. The modeler agent achieves better individual outcomes than a non-metacognitive agent and is more successful at encouraging cooperation. The opponent-perspective agent, by contrast, fails to achieve these outcomes because it lacks important information about the opponent. These simple agents provide insights regarding modeling of metacognition in more complex tasks.	intelligent agent;interaction;metacognition;prisoner's dilemma;social characteristics	Christopher A.

Product planning house of quality (PPHOQ) is of fundamental and strategic importance in the QFD system. Correctly determining the final priority ratings of CRs is essential in the process of constructing PPHOQ, because it will largely affect the target value of ECs for product improvement. This paper present a systematic and operational method based on the integration of a minimal deviation based method (MDBM), balanced scorecard (BSC), analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and scale method to determine the final priority ratings of CRs. To exploit the competition and preference information of product improvement, the MDBM is developed to determine the CPRs of CRs. A concept of the total output of achieving the ITPE of a CR is introduced and analyzed by using the integration of BSC, AHP and scale method in a qualitative and quantitative way, and then the priority rating of achieving the ITPE of this CR is determined. Finally, a case study is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The service levels that are specified consequent to the criticality evaluation serve as one of the inputs enabling smooth operation of production facilities. Systematic criticality evaluation of spare parts is the key to effective control of spare parts inventory systems. In order to deal with this problem, the criticality of the spare parts (SPs) must be confirmed. There are many factors to be considered as a part of the criticality of spare parts for maintenance activities. Consequently, evaluation procedures involve several objectives and it is often necessary to compromise among possibly conflicting tangible and intangible factors. For these reasons, MCDM has been found to be a useful approach to solve this kind of problem.

A comparison suggests that classification tree techniques may provide more effective estimates than other techniques. A data set (n=227) with 9 risk factors is used to develop a classification tree estimate. Results from this analysis provide a classification tree with 8 nodes that demonstrates the ease of interpretation of the classification tree results. The results are relatively easy to understand and provide actionable information. While results are only preliminary, we conclude that a risk assessment tool based on classification tree techniques could provide a new and effective tool in the management of IT project risk.	artificial neural network;classification chart;decision tree learning;predictive modelling;risk assessment;risk factor (computing)	Andrew Gemino;Chris Sauer;Blaize Horner Reich	2007			risk analysis	ML	-14.717270243862949	-22.86233262215927	57419

It is based on advanced components to optimize the strategies and stratagems to be followed within the company, helping businesses to achieve competitive advantage in the market. A business simulator is flexible, adaptive, has learning ability, is robust and fault tolerant. Our intelligent tool uses different methodologies to provide optimal strategies to improve competitiveness of a company, the ability of the model can provide strategies that are not obvious because they can find no obvious relationship among variables that can help the manager or leader of an organization to realize a better decision. This tool is an aid in the process of improving competitiveness because it supports the strategic decisions made in an organizational level.		Alberto Ochoa;J.

The SPATSIM (SPatial and Time Series Information Modeling) system has been developed in Delphi using MapObjects and incorporates a spatial data interface for access to the different types of information commonly associated with water resource analyses. All of the information is stored within database tables (Paradox by default) with generic structures. The structure and components of the system are briefly described and some example applications provided. The discussion identifies some of the criticisms that have been leveled at the software, the approach of the developers to user support and some possible future developments. The conclusions suggest that the development can be considered successful in that it has substantially improved the efficiency of the Institute for Water Research to undertake one of its core functions of hydrological model development and application.	information model;paradox (database);simulation;spatial file manager;spatial navigation;table (database);time series	Denis A.

Therefore, it is necessary to identify areas prone to landslides for prevention work. This paper proposes an improved information value model based on gray clustering (IVM-GC) for landslide susceptibility mapping. This method uses the information value derived from an information value model to achieve susceptibility classification and weight determination of landslide predisposing factors and, hence, obtain the landslide susceptibility of each study unit based on the clustering analysis. Using a landslide inventory of Chongqing, China, which contains 8435 landslides, three landslide susceptibility maps were generated based on the common information value model (IVM), an information value model improved by an analytic hierarchy process (IVM-AHP) and our new improved model. Approximately 70% (5905) of the inventory landslides were used to generate the susceptibility maps, while the remaining 30% (2530) were used to validate the results. The training accuracies of the IVM, IVM-AHP and IVM-GC were 81.8%, 78.7% and 85.2%, respectively, and the prediction accuracies were 82.0%, 78.7% and 85.4%, respectively. The results demonstrate that all three methods perform well in evaluating landslide susceptibility. Among them, IVM-GC has the best performance.	analytical hierarchy;cluster analysis;map	Qianqian Ba;Yumin Chen;Susu Deng;Qianjiao Wu;Jiaxin Yang;Jingyi Zhang	2017	ISPRS Int. J.

Dynamic pricing is an area of interest for both researchers and professionals. It’s the process of price specification in a way that best suits a tourism organization under certain circumstances that reflect its competitive environment. Many research studies have addressed dynamic pricing from different perspectives. This study suggests that the use of a hybrid approach that combines Delphi method and fuzzy cognitive maps is suitable for it introduces fuzzy logic in order to capture the subjectivity and vagueness involved into evaluating the business settings, but it also provides for the necessary flexibility in analyzing the assumptions and the implications of different pricing scenarios.	delphi method;fuzzy cognitive map;fuzzy logic;three-dimensional virtual tourism;usability;vagueness	Dimitris Kardaras;Xenia J.

Furthermore, many measures and design methods have been proposed for flexible manufacturing systems. Surely scope economies are one of the most important strategic form of flexibility in manufacturing systems and their strategic impact has been acknowledged by the very beginning of the flexible manufacturing era. However, despite several researches are available to address scope economies measurement and design methodologies, very few researches investigate their economic convenience in front of dedicated manufacturing systems depending on the competitive market conditions. This paper proposes a theoretical model whose main aim is the general understanding of the convenience conditions of scope economies-based manufacturing systems. The results of the theoretical model are very interesting, because they locate market conditions that make scope economies manufacturing systems less profitable than dedicated manufacturing ones; moreover, the proposed model sets some general criteria to guide the entrepreneur in making right investment decision regarding this kind of manufacturing investments. Such results can explain the reason of many failures of flexible manufacturing systems and it suggests the use of this kind of approach to investigate other flexibility forms of manufacturing systems. The ultimate goal of this research is the construction of a Decision Support System for supporting the entrepreneur in making decision on Advanced Manufacturing Systems investment decisions. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper addresses the simulation of pedestrians evacuating along the road network in city. In a developing country, the coastal city often has a complicated roads network and the devices to support an evacuation are simple and shortage so the alert signs are the good devices. We assume that there is a given alert signs system in the city, pedestrians facing a Tsunami have difference behaviors with the signs. The simulations's result help us to estimate the number of survivors and the global amount of rescue time. Agent based model is used to build the evacuation of pedestrians with details behaviors of them.

The factors affecting the prioritizations are not simple and may or may not be quantitative. The experience needed for solving this problem can be extracted from the experts and can be used in building an expert system to support the decision making process. This work is targeted to finding out a general model based on expert system technology [1] to support the process of prioritizing the execution of shortroad links. The previous studies in this field are surveyed and discussed [2,3,4]. A novel model is proposed to capture all factors affecting the process and the methods used in solving the problem.

In order to resolve this paradox, evolutionary game theory has focused on the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD), which incorporates the essence of this conflict. Here, we encode strategies for the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) in terms of conditional probabilities that represent the response of decision pathways given previous plays. We find that if these stochastic strategies are encoded as genes that undergo Darwinian evolution, the environmental conditions that the strategies are adapting to determine the fixed point of the evolutionary trajectory, which could be either cooperation or defection. A transition between cooperative and defective attractors occurs as a function of different parameters such as mutation rate, replacement rate, and memory, all of which affect a player's ability to predict an opponent's behavior. These results imply that in populations of players that can use previous decisions to plan future ones, cooperation depends critically on whether the players can rely on facing the same strategies that they have adapted to. Defection, on the other hand, is the optimal adaptive response in environments that change so quickly that the information gathered from previous plays cannot usefully be integrated for a response.	biological evolution;biological system;body tissue;encode;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point number;game theory;hyperlipoproteinemia type iib;interpupillary distance;iterated function;iteration;population;prisoner's dilemma;probability	Dimitris Iliopoulos;Arend Hintze;Christoph Adami	2010		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000948	computer simulation;mutation;biology;game theory;mutation rate;evolutionary game theory;simulation;conditional probability;artificial intelligence;gene;fixed point;genetics;prisoner's dilemma;principal component analysis	AI	-15.538021785921842	-16.783020635724668	60193
338f5549b93e0a66c780cf03610cbf3aecb9473a	co-action provides rational basis for the evolution of cooperation		How cooperation can originate and be maintained in a society of selfish individuals is one of the central questions in evolutionary biology and social sciences. Formally, it can be posed in the context of the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma (IPD) game where agents interact by either cooperating or defecting in each round, based on the information about their choices in previous rounds of the game. It has been recently shown that social dilemmas arising in single-stage games can be resolved in the co-action framework when the agents are in a completely symmetric situation. Here we examine the IPD from a co-action perspective and show that it allows cooperation to emerge and subsequently be sustained even in the presence of noise. Specifically, we show that the co-action equilibrium for an N-player IPD is a state in which a majority of cooperators coexist with defectors, the exact composition being determined by the ratio of the payoffs. For an IPD between two players, we show that the co-action solution corresponds to a win-stay, lose-shift behavioral rule, thereby providing a rational basis for this Pavlovian strategy.	coexist (image);interpupillary distance;iterated function;prisoner's dilemma;the evolution of cooperation;win–stay, lose–switch	V.

The work deals with the interplay between knowledge diffusion and the spreading of these preventable infections in the population. The knowledge diffusion model combines information acquisition through education, personal experiences, and the spreading of information through a scalefree social network. A conditional probability model is used to model the interdependence between the risk of infection and the level of health awareness acquired. The model is applied to study the spread of HIV/Aids, malaria, and tuberculosis in the South African province Limpopo. The simulation results show that the effect of various awareness interventions can be very different and that a concerted effort to spread health awareness through various channels is more likely to control the spread of these preventable infections in a reasonable time.	agent-based model;experience;interdependence;multi-agent system;simulation;social network;social simulation	Ahmed Y.

FDM provides a simpler approach to solve such problems compared with the method of Analytical Network Process (ANP) developed in 1996. ANP is a general form of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). On the other hand, FDM is only employed to derive evaluation criteria. It can't be used for ranking alternatives as usually required in many real world MCDM problems. The aim of this work is to enhance the FDM structure to be able to make a proper decision for complex decision making problem by selecting best alternative.

Supplier evaluation and selection is one of the main strategic decisions for purchasing management in supply chain. This paper use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to propose a new model for evaluation and ranking of a given set of suppliers from sustainable point of view. The proposed model integrates the fuzzy set theory and DEA to consider the decision makers’ preferences and handle the ambiguity and uncertainty in supplier selection process. For this purpose, linguistic values in the form of triangular fuzzy numbers are used to assess the weights of criteria, sub-criteria, and the ratings of suppliers’ performance with respect to sub-criteria. Then, a fuzzy-DEA model, using α -cut approach, is developed considering weight constraints. An application from Supplying Automotive Parts Company (SAPCO) Company, which is one of the largest suppliers of automotive parts in the Middle-East, is presented to show the applicability of the proposed model. Finally, the proposed weight restriction fuzzy-DEA model is validated through comparing with one of the recent supplier selection methods.	fuzzy concept	Atefeh Amindoust	2018	RAIRO - Operations Research	10.1051/ro/2017033	computer science;data envelopment analysis;fuzzy set;sustainable development	HCI	-5.296976338245918	-16.980862685529978	61021

Model managers have been proposed to select and direct the use of models in a decision setting. A limitation of model managers is their inability to optimally integrate several models to arrive at a decision. A scheme to overcome this limitation is presented. By specifying input requirements to each model and outputs available from each model, a string of models may be developed. An implicit enumeration algorithm ensures a feasible string of models for a required output and composes the string in optimal form according to a user-defined objective. The algorithm may be used in conjunction with existing model management techniques.

This research develops a fuzzy multiple attribute decision-making applied in the group decision-making to improving advanced manufacturing technology selection process. Since numerous attributes have been considered in evaluating the manufacturing technology suitability, most information available in this stage is subjective, imprecise and vague, fuzzy sets theory provides a mathematical framework for modeling imprecision and vagueness. In the proposed approach, a new fusion method of fuzzy information is developed to managing information assessed in different linguistic scales (multi-granularity linguistic term sets) and numerical scales. The flexible manufacturing system adopted in the Taiwanese bicycle industry is employed in this study to demonstrate the computational process of the proposed method.

Production systems today are mostly one-of-a-kind complex, engineered-to-order systems. Their ramp-up is a complex order of physical and logical adjustments which are characterised by try and error decision making resulting in frequent reiterations and unnecessary repetitions. Studie s have shown that clear goal setting and feedback can significantly improve the effectiveness of decision-makin g in predominantly human decision processes such as ramp-up. However, few measure ment-driven decision aides have been reported which focus on ram p-up improvement and no systematic app roach for ramp-up time reduction has yet been defined. In this paper, a framework for measuring the performance during rampup is proposed in order to support decision making by providing clear metrics based on the measurable and observable status of the technical system. This work proposes a systematic framework for data preparation, ramp-up formalisation, and performa nce measurement. A model for defining the ramp-up state of a system has been developed in order to formalise and capture its condition. Functionality, quality and performance based metrics have been identified to formalise a clear ramp-up index as a measure ment to guide and support the human decisio n making. For the validation of the proposed frame work, two rampup processes of an assembly station were emulated and their comparison was used to evaluate this work. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

b4c7bf1c88ea6b3ea79e68218a29d3b141a13387	a consolidated approach to the axiomatization of outranking relations: a survey and new results	article accepte pour publication ou publie;outranking methods;concordance discordance relations;conjoint measurement;nontransitive preferences;multiple criteria decision analysis	Outranking relations such as produced by the Electre I or II or the Tactic methods are based on a concordance and non-discordance principle that leads to declaring that an alternative is “superior” to another, if the coalition of attributes supporting this proposition is “sufficiently important” (concordance condition) and if there is no attribute that “strongly rejects” it (non-discordance condition). Such a way of comparing alternatives is rather natural and does not require a detailed analysis of tradeoffs between the various attributes. However, it is well known that it may produce binary relations that do not possess any remarkable property of transitivity or completeness. The axiomatic foundations of outranking relations have recently received attention. Within a conjoint measurement framework, characterizations of reflexive concordance-discordance relations have been obtained. These relations encompass those generated by the Electre I and II methods, which are non-strict (reflexive) relations. A different characterization has been provided for strict (asymmetric) preference relations such as produced by Tactic. In this paper we briefly review the various kinds of axiomatizations of outranking relations proposed so far in the literature. Then we analyze the relationships between reflexive and asymmetric outranking relations in a conjoint measurement framework, consolidating our previous work. Co-duality plays an essential rôle in our analysis. It allows us to understand the correspondence between the previous characterizations. Making a step further, we provide a common axiomatic characterization for both types of relations. Applying the co-duality operator to concordance-discordance relations also yields a new and interesting type of preference relation that we call concordance relation with bonus. The axiomatic characterization of such relations results directly from co-duality arguments.	axiomatic system;concordance (publishing);strict function;theory of conjoint measurement;vertex-transitive graph	Denis Bouyssou;Marc Pirlot	2015	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-015-1803-y	operations management;mathematics;multiple-criteria decision analysis;welfare economics	Theory	-4.827737771844123	-22.26772807882164	62087
63e10f89676ee7defe4161b5ebd67c7cfdf0a3f5	agent-based modeling and strategic group formation: a refugee case study		Refugee flight presents a logistics problem for humanitarian aid workers anticipating ebbs and flows of arrivals. These migrations include travel over long distances with little advanced coordination and damaged social networks. The model presented here is based on these two fundamental premises: long distance and strategic en-route coordination. Assuming that over large distances, refugees attempt to construct groups that provide assistance or security as they navigate toward safety, the agent-based model incorporates cooperative game theory to investigate the impact of group formations on egress times. The modeled refugees make decisions based on individual utility functions informed by two factors, speed of the group and group size. Since groups accommodate slower members, they may reform as refugees choose their best available strategies to reach safety. The results indicate a tipping point in average group size as the slowest group members have more of impact in the utility function of the agents.	agent-based model;egress filtering;game theory;logistics;social network;utility	Andrew J.

However, an important point that deserves to be studied in detail is what happens when agents behave egoistically and possibly violate the norms they should comply with. The objective of this work is to present an integrated view of the sanctioning process and analyze each of its phases with regard to its operationalization in artificial societies. Moreover we review several sanctioning mechanisms presented in the multiagent literature and examine them in the context of our proposed process.

The group interest is computed on-line by the agents using their own local observations.

The idea of this European project is to determine how low ca rbon scenarios, and in particular scenarios with a high share of renewable electricity, affect emissions of air poll utants and greenhouse gases (GHG) and contribute to mitigation of negative energy system impacts on human health and ecosystems. A Platform of Integrated Assessment (PI A) has been elaborated to provide impact results for a sel ection of scenarios via a set of models (large-scal e energy models, Life Cycle Assessment models, ...). This PIA is cur rently available through a web service. The concept of the PIA is detailed and to illustrate its interest, a set of r esults is given with the use of the simulation mode f the European version of GAINS for a selection of scenarios.	ecosystem;energy systems language;ico (file format);iso 8601;simulation;web service	Isabelle Blanc;Benoît Gschwind;Mireille Lefevre;Didier Beloin-Saint-Pierre;Thierry Ranchin;Lionel Ménard;Janusz Cofala;Sabine Fuss;Artur Wyrwa;Kamila Drebszok;Daniel Stetter;Martijn Schaap	2013			simulation;environmental protection;engineering;environmental resource management	Metrics	-13.493196879759923	-20.7244147018455	63114

This principle belongs to information fusion in general, and is called belief fusion when the evidence is represented as belief functions. Because different situations can involve different forms of belief fusion, there is no single formal model that is suitable for analyzing every situation. It is therefore crucial to identify the most adequate fusion operator for modeling each class of situations to be analyzed. It can be challenging to determine the best belief fusion model for a specific situation, and there has been considerable confusion around this issue in the literature. In this paper we illustrate the importance of selecting a belief fusion model that adequately matches the situation to be analyzed, and propose a classification method for this purpose. A set of formal fusion operators is described to provide examples of specific models for classes of fusion situations.	belief revision;correctness (computer science);mathematical model;oracle fusion middleware;taxonomy (general);vagueness	Audun Jøsang;Paulo Cesar G. da Costa;Erik Blasch	2013	Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Information Fusion		artificial intelligence;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics	Robotics	-5.435256310869341	-22.01546916291069	63403

It captures the concept of “genotype x environment”, integrates the human dimensions of vineyard management, and builds a “sense of place” from landscape and climate characteristics. The understated topographic changes, broad thick mantles of loess, subtle changes in large agronomic fields, diffuse climatic and ecological boundaries, and brief viticulture history contribute to a misperception that terroir may not be applicable or that niche microclimates for vineyards may not exist in the Northern Great Plains. Compared to New York and the Great Lakes vineyard traditions, our history is brief and our knowledge of growing environments is only now evolving. The lack of viticulture history in the Northern Great Plains is a real constraint to new growers, wineries, crop insurance companies, USDA, and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB; formerly ATF). Although the growing season characteristics of the Northern Great Plains are very suitable to producing high quality winegrapes, it is the dormancy period and the inherent extreme temperature variability that challenges the sustainability of the vineyards.	computer engineering;display resolution;heart rate variability;location (geography);niche blogging;topography	William J.

5c8b8fe527287ef02b0915d6f7f53490b456e188	kimono, a descriptive agent-based modelling method for the exploration of complex systems: an application to epidemiology. (kimono: une méthode de modélisation descriptive centrée agent pour l'explication des systèmes complexes, une application en épidémiologie)		Since a few years, in many different domains (e.g. sociology, ecology or economy), there is a growing trend in designing models that can be used for exploratory purposes rather than purely predictive ones. Loosely following a «complex systems» paradigm, exploratory models are often based on explicit and detailed representations of the components of the systems studied, and offer a large degree of freedom in the parameter or structural adjustments available to their final users (researchers, decision-makers or stakeholders). They are intended to be used as a support of «as-if experiments» as they allow, through these adjustments, for the formulation of detailed hypotheses at various levels of description of the system. These hypotheses then lead to the generation of scenarios whose outcomes are explored and compared by way of repeated simulations. Epidemiology is an interesting example of this situation. Its long modelling history can be characterised as a search for simple predictive models, but recent examples like the outbreaks of avian influenza in South-East Asia have shown their limits: without properly taking into account the interplays between social, ecological and biological dynamics to understand how this pandemic evolves, these models become useless as far as prediction goes. And when some of these dynamics are tentatively taken into account, the resulting models often become dependent on incomplete or qualitative data (for instance, the decision-making processes of social actors or the behaviours of birds), which prevents them to be used for any serious predicting purposes. As a consequence, there has been a recent shift of focus of the community on the design of exploratory models, which are meant to allow understanding the links between these dynamics, generating and studying various hypotheses, and measuring, with respect to these hypotheses, the impact of local or global policies in complex scenarios. However, designing and using such models gives rise to serious methodological issues and existing modelling and simulation methods do not cope very well with this new type of models. When they are adapted to take their peculiarities into account, this often results in ad hoc solutions, which can barely be reused for other models in the same domain, let alone in different domains. The objective of this thesis is to propose a domain-independent method (KIMONO) to facilitate the design and use of such exploratory models. Based on a series of examples from various domains (road traffic, social segregation, soil dynamics and more extensively epidemiology), I proceed from an account of the design requirements (taking conflicting and evolving hypotheses into account during the modelling process, producing highly-modular models, enabling an iterative modelling cycle, allowing for the collaboration of different experts and the combination of different formalisms, etc.) to a concrete proposal involving dedicated computer tools and a common accessible formalism, both aimed at facilitating the collaboration, communication and the implementation of «world models» (the name given in this proposal to open exploratory models). The method I propose focuses on two elements: the implication of the experts and a detailed representation of the system. Experts are at the centre of the modelling process, which starts with extensive descriptions of their knowledge, possibly reusing their formalism, and further proceeds through iterative amendments (of increasing or decreasing complexity) that they are able to evaluate and validate in interaction with the modellers. The iterative process comes to an end when the experts estimate that they have a sufficient insight of the system or when further investigations require field experiments. Regarding the kind of representation suitable for supporting this process, I propose an adaptable and modular combination of two implementation systems: Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) and Geographical 3 Information Systems (GIS). I show that this combination provides for an arbitrary level of description of the components of a system, that it allows both qualitative and quantitative knowledge to be equally represented and that it supports a high level of evolution of the hypotheses during the modelling process. The interactions between modellers and experts are based on two abstractions of these implementation details, using both the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, Details) protocol for communication purposes, and the GAML modelling language for the collaborative programming of the model. The method proposed has been applied and validated in the context of a large study undertaken in South-East Asia (especially North-Vietnam) by epidemiologists and veterinarians to understand the role of various hypotheses in explaining the recurring outbreaks of the avian influenza epidemics among domestic poultry. During a four years long interdisciplinary collaboration, several «world models» have been codesigned, implemented on the GAMA platform and used as «virtual laboratories» by experts. This collaboration, and its unique outcomes, have allowed them to test a broad range of hypotheses (especially on the local conditions of persistence), better understand the role of various spatial, ecological or social factors in the survival and propagation of the virus and reorient some of their field studies in consequence.

e8c6ff36d38be31449fd54cee92f9b0a6b9dbd8a	comparing robust decision-making and dynamic adaptive policy pathways for model-based decision support under deep uncertainty	adaptation pathways;dynamic adaptive policy pathways;scenario discovery;deep uncertainty;robust decision making;robustness;flexibility	A variety of model-based approaches for supporting decision-making under deep uncertainty have been suggested, but they are rarely compared and contrasted. In this paper, we compare Robust DecisionMaking with Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways. We apply both to a hypothetical case inspired by a river reach in the Rhine Delta of the Netherlands, and compare themwith respect to the required tooling, the resulting decision relevant insights, and the resulting plans. The results indicate that the two approaches are complementary. Robust Decision-Making offers insights into conditions under which problems occur, and makes trade-offs transparent. The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach emphasizes dynamic adaptation over time, and thus offers a natural way for handling the vulnerabilities identified through Robust Decision-Making. The application also makes clear that the analytical process of Robust Decision-Making is path-dependent and open ended: an analyst has to make many choices, for which Robust Decision-Making offers no direct guidance. © 2016 The Authors.

However, most literature views SN as a static system and the study on the evolution of SNs is very limited. Based on complex adaptive system and fitness landscape theory, this paper first proposes an evolution model of SNs in order to understand the general principle of SN evolution. Then the paper conducts a multi-agent simulation on the evolution model, and discloses that the SN emerges and evolves from firms’ dynamic interaction under the dynamic environment. Dominated by the environment and firms’ internal mechanism, the evolution is highly sensitive to the initial condition, and it is pathdependent and difficult to predict precisely. Although the dynamics of environments is different, a SN enjoys the stable structure in different environments. Higher level of structure stability and fitness of the SN are achieved when the firms in the SN adopt the long-term collaboration strategy rather than the short-term strategy. Finally, a China case is explored which validates the self-organization evolution of SNs. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Failure and faulty diagnosis is one of the most complicated and dynamic problems in the industrial plant management since most of failures are extremely ambiguous which needs to be solved based on an expert’s experience. This makes the solutions very subjective and requires too much time, efforts and monetary investment. In this paper, we are proposing new failure detection approach with machine learning and human expertise by using alarm data. As the first step of developing this new method, we collected several types of alarm data that detected functional failure in Hyundai Steel factory. We analyzed and processed the alarm data with 35 domain experts. Based on the data, we propose a knowledge based system which is Ripple Down Rule-based. This system acquires knowledge by machine learning which is maintained by human experts. The evaluation results showed that the proposed failure detection framework can reduce the time of human expertise acquisition and the cost of solving over-generalization and over-fitting problems by using machine learning techniques.	knowledge-based systems;restrictive design rules	Dohyeong Kim;Soyeon Caren Han;Yingru Lin;Byeong Ho Kang;Sungyoung Lee	2018	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2018.02.009	machine learning;computer science;alarm;artificial intelligence;cyber-physical system;dynamic problem;knowledge-based systems;factory;functional failure	EDA	-7.631999042553091	-14.946423668298365	64354

This interest emerges from higher frequencies of combined sewer outflows, floods and exposure of residents and habitat to pollutedwater resulting fromgrowing urbanization and related pressure on stormwater management facilities. While this approach is promising, there aremanyunknowns about the effects of specific implementation aspects (e.g., scale, layout), particularly as urban settlements and climate conditions change over time. If green infrastructure is to be required by law, these aspects need to be better understood. We developed a spatially-explicit process-based model (the Landscape Green Infrastructure Design model, L-GriD) developed to understand how the design of green infrastructure may affect performance at a neighborhood scale, taking into consideration the magnitude of stormevents, and the spatial layout of different kinds of land cover. We inform the mechanisms in our model with established hydrological models. In contrast with watershed data-intensive models in one extreme and site level cost-savings calculators in the other, our model allows us to generalize principles for green infrastructure design and implementation at a neighborhood scale, to informpolicy-making. Simulation results show that with as little as 10% surface coverage, green infrastructure can greatly contribute to runoff capture in small storms, but that the amountwould need to be doubled or tripled to dealwith larger storms in a similarway.Whenplacement options are limited, layouts in which green infrastructure is dispersed across the landscape—particularly vegetated curb cuts—are more effective in reducing flooding in all storm types than clustered arrangements. As opportunities for green infrastructure placement increase and as precipitation increases, however, patterns that follow the flow-path and accumulation of water become more effective, which can be built on an underlying curb-cut layout. If space constraints prevented any of these layouts, random placement would still provide benefits over clustered layouts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

6c5e7f0a8663412e559703dc3af634bc65e87ddd	a group decision making support system for the web: how to work in environments with a high number of participants and alternatives		Abstract One of the main challenges that the appearance of Web 2.0 and the overall spreading of the Internet have generated is how to tackle with the high number of users and information available. This problem is also inherited by the group decision making problems that can be carried out over the Web. In this article, to solve this issue, a group decision making support system that allows the use of a high number of participants and alternatives is presented. This method allows any number of participants to join the decision making process at any time. Furthermore, they let them provide information only about a certain subset of alternatives. The high participation rate can provide enough information for the decision process to be carried out even if the participants do not provide information about all the high number of available alternatives.	world wide web	Juan Antonio Morente-Molinera;Gang Kou;Ignacio J.

69ffa3ef1f163dd3168604ffb963a46100eb34f3	quantitative modeling of polarization in online intelligent argumentation and deliberation for capturing collective intelligence		Massive online argumentation deliberation has the potential to capture collective intelligence and crowd wisdom. However, certain observable phenomena, such as polarization, often emerge in online argumentation and deliberation, preventing constructive discourse. Accurately detecting the presence and intensity of polarization is important to determining if collective intelligence and crowd wisdom can be captured from online deliberation. In this paper, an innovative method of measuring polarization quantitatively in online argumentation is presented. Important polarization attributes such as homogeneity in groups, heterogeneity across groups, the number of poles, and the size of poles are identified to measure polarization in online argumentation. This new method uses our argumentation tool, Intelligent Cyber Argumentation System's (ICAS) cognitive computing component, a fuzzy logic engine, to derive the participant's agreement distribution. Then we apply an income polarization measurement from the field of economics [7] that we have modified and expanded for argumentation, on the agreement distribution to produce a polarization index value. We discuss why our method to measure argumentation polarization is a significant improvement over existing measurements for online argumentation polarization in terms of these identified attributes. We conducted empirical studies using ICAS that demonstrate that our method outperforms others that exist on our empirical data.	argumentation framework;cognitive computing;collective intelligence;fuzzy logic;observable;polarization (waves);sensor;wisdom of the crowd	Joseph Sirrianni;Xiaoqing Liu;Douglas Adams	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCC.2018.00015	argumentation theory;empirical research;constructive;fuzzy logic;collective intelligence;deliberation;cognitive computing;machine learning;online deliberation;artificial intelligence	AI	-16.58634785164945	-18.79735617517596	65403

The attacker-defender interaction is modeled as a game in which a defender deploys a temporal platform migration defense. Against this defense, a population of attackers develop strategies specifying the temporal ordering of resource investments that bring targeted zero-day exploits into existence. Attacker response to two defender temporal platform migration scheduling policies are examined. In the first defender scheduling policy, the defender selects the active platform in each match uniformly at random from a pool of available platforms. In the second policy the defender schedules each successive platform to maximize the diversity of the source code presented to the attacker. Adaptive attacker response strategies are modeled by finite state machine (FSM) constructs that evolve during simulated play against defender strategies via an evolutionary algorithm. It is demonstrated that the attacker learns to invest heavily in exploit creation for the platform with the least similarity to other platforms when faced with a diversity defense, while avoiding investment in exploits for this least similar platform when facing a randomization defense. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the diversity-maximizing defense is superior for shorter duration attacker-defender engagements, but performs sub-optimally in extended attacker-defender interactions.

The agents use the similarity information on the user preferences for providing services with the best quality. This similarity information is formed by using the clustering techniques. The agents are allowed to interact with others and exchange information based on this information. The agents’ beliefs are formed based on the clustering process results and the user feedback for the information gained by the interactions. These beliefs are used to provide a continuous service for the user. The natural division of tasks among the agents reduces the workload for each agent. The cluster structure of the society may be changed according to the satisfaction levels of the users. Some general society parameters of the system are learned by a reinforcement learning method. We designed the agents by using our proposed social interactive agent model. The system model can be used for many of the serving systems by changing the service type.	cluster analysis;intelligent agent;interaction;mud;multi-user;reinforcement learning;user (computing)	Sanem Sariel;B.

In particular the functions that are used to estimate delay from volume of vehicles do not allow the representation of the phenomenon of congestion spillback. In some cases one needs to understand and analyze microscopic properties associated to how travelers adjust to the conditions they encounter. This, on its turn, leads to dynamic environments that are difficult to analyze with conventional tools. This paper presents an agent-based simulation of route choice under different conditions of demand generation, number, and types of driver agents. We consider more sophisticated drivers' behaviors such as en-route decision-making. Besides, they may be equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle communication. We discuss the effects of the use of: various ratio demand/capacity, demand generation, information exchange, and re-planning strategies. The use of an agent-based approach allows the analysis of different classes of agents, thus departing from the investigation of population-wide metrics only. The main conclusion is that for travelers whose trips are long, there is a benefit of using communication and replan en-route, depending on the demand. However, in general, having imperfect information is advantageous, especially from the whole system perspective.	agent-based model;agent-based social simulation;computation;coupling (computer programming);default route;delay calculation;information exchange;network congestion;routing;simulation;steady state;vehicle-to-vehicle	Maicon de Brito do Amarante;Ana L.

The comparative results of the application of the scenario evaluation function for each criteria: aircraft counting and Dynamic Density (or Airspace Complexity) are promising. It is possible to verify that the scenarios with the same number of aircraft presented a state value with significant variations between these two functions (with or without Dynamic Density).

However, the question remains of how to generate a useful potential function. Previous research demonstrated the use of STRIPS operator knowledge to automatically generate a potential function for single-agent reinforcement learning. Following up on this work, we investigate the use of STRIPS planning knowledge in the context of MARL. Our results show that a potential function based on joint or individual plan knowledge can significantly improve MARL performance compared with no shaping. In addition, we investigate the limitations of individual plan knowledge as a source of reward shaping in cases where the combination of individual agent plans causes conflict.	multi-agent system;noise shaping;reinforcement learning;strips	Sam Devlin;Daniel Kudenko	2016	Knowledge Eng.

We understand quite well how water moves through plants and soils at small scales but the medium is never the same from one spot to the next. This is the curse of locality. It is difficult to capture such processes with a single global model. In the last two decades, hydrology has slowly moved into two related fields: global hydrology and catchment hydrology. In global hydrology, making use of new computational resources, scientists use uniform global models at ever increasing spatial and temporal resolutions, forced with satellite data or climate model output to make claims on the global state of the hydrological cycle [1], [2]. Parallel to this development, researchers in catchment hydrology, have focussed on deriving, for each catchment that is studied, the best hydrological models for that specific catchment. This is nicely summarized in the overview paper of the last hydrological decade [3]. While global hydrologists realize that hydrological processes are locally very different and human influence even more so [4], incorporating the body of local hydrological knowledge is not easy. Catchment hydrologists realize the importance of their work to the global watercycle but often lack the (computational) resources and tools to upscale from their catchment to the global picture. The eWaterCycle II project will build and maintain an e- Infrastructure that allows for quick and safe inclusion of submodels and model concepts into global hydrological models, leading to a better understanding of the Hydrological cycle. The foreseen e-infrastructure will have a number of unique advantages, including an ability for knowledge gap discovery, machine-assisted model curation, and easily changeable model parts. In this work we will present the how we will achieve the goals of the recently started eWaterCycle II project over its three year runtime. We will show a demo of a first prototype environment where scientist can run, compare and alter different hydrological models that focus on the same region and use the same input data sources. This will work even if the underlying hydrological models are written in different programming languages without exposing the hydrologists doing the comparison to these technical intricacies. Although the eWaterCycle II project focusses on the hydrological setting, the underlying framework will be suitable outside of hydrology, wherever a collaborative environment is required. eScience aspects such as large scale data assimilation (DA) techniques, generic multi-model multi-scale environments, FAIR data as well as FAIR software, will all benefit from research done in this project.

However, these analyzes are based on the brainstorming of decision makers which may lead to subjectivity problems. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a new SWOT analysis model based on the fuzzy analytic network process (ANP) that deals with the subjectivity shortcoming.	fuzzy concept	Mounira Souli;Ahmed Badreddine;Taieb Ben Romdhane	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-60042-0_49	management science;fuzzy logic;strategic planning;group decision-making;brainstorming;swot analysis;analytic network process;context analysis;subjectivity;computer science	NLP	-5.524576895996363	-17.248042381665297	66478
bee91b02ca55c0482d11c74ea9443c34c72ea9db	task structure, individual bounded rationality and crowdsourcing performance: an agent-based simulation approach		Crowdsourcing is increasingly employed by enterprises outsourcing certain internal problems to external boundedly rational problem solvers who may be more e icient. However, despite the relative abundance of crowdsourcing research, how the matching relationship between task types and solver types works is far from clear. This study intends to clarify this issue by investigating the interplay between task structure and individual bounded rationality on crowdsourcing performance. For this purpose, we have introduced interaction relationships of task decisions to define three di erently structured tasks, i.e., local tasks, small-world tasks and random tasks. We also consider bounded rationality, considering twodimensions i.e., bounded rationality level used to distinguish industry types, and bounded rationality bias used to di erentiate professional users from ordinary users. This agent-based model (ABM) is constructed by combining NK fitness landscape with the TCPE (Task-Crowd-Process-Evaluation), a framework depicting crowdsourcing processes, to simulate the problem-solving process of tournament-based crowdsourcing. Results would suggest that under the same task complexity, random tasks are more di icult to complete than local tasks. This is evident in emerging industries, where the bounded rationality level of solvers is generally low, regardless of the type of solvers, local tasks always perform best and random tasks worst. However, in traditional industries, where the bounded rationality level of solvers is generally higher, when solvers are ordinary users, local tasks perform best, followed by small-world and then random tasks. When solvers aremore expert, random tasks perform best, followed by small-world and then local tasks, but the gap between these three tasks in crowdsourcing performance is not immediately obvious. When solvers are professional, random tasks perform best, followed by small-world and then local tasks, and the gap between these three tasks in crowdsourcing performance is obvious.

f0d21282971c9b70a89adef28d48deafc0b0e6f5	complex evolutionary pathways in interacting linguistic communities		We experiment with a linguistic change mechanism in a community of interacting agents and show the various phenomena that may emerge under different social constraints. We assume phonological and lexical learning and a semantic reference to external objects in the environment. Distinct groups of agents with initially different languages converge to a common language, with the relevant frequency of inter-agent interactions controlling which language dominates. Moreover, an initially monolingual community diverges due to social factors creating agent grouping, where agents interact more frequently with members of the same group. Additional cognitive features, like innovation and attention , lead to increased linguistic divergence between groups and word bistability. Finally, cultural learning leads to continuous linguistic change and occasional coexistence of multiple words, as well as revival of rare words. Overall, it appears that the initial community may evolve in arbitrary directions, and languages may dynamically form, split , mutate, and oscillate.

In this paper such systems class is called Interactive Internet Systems with Dynamically Changing Offers (IISDCO). In IISDCO systems an offer change may cause cancellation of the started but incomplete transactions. The necessity of cancellation can result from the sale of a set of resources (goods sold) which is getting exhausted or whose price has changed. This paper includes a performance analysis of an on-line stock exchange system (sample of IISDCO). For the analysis we used models in the form of Time Coloured Petri Nets (TCPNs). We also reviewed the proposed models on the example of the Internet on-line stock exchange system.	cdma subscriber identity module;coloured petri net;experiment;internet;loss of significance;norm (social);online and offline;performance prediction;profiling (computer programming);queueing theory;reference model;simulation;systems theory	Tomasz Rak;Jan Werewka	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-28038-2_9	simulation;system of systems;engineering;operations management;advertising	OS	-7.873609766647506	-11.777548660386968	66898

62622df960e3e3c73c3b0d84fd9693a5c2aac3b8	a linguistic approach to concurrent design		This paper outlines a concurrent design methodology for multidisciplinary systems, which employs tools of fuzzy theory for the tradeoff in the design space. This methodology enhances communication between designers from various disciplines through introducing the universal notion of satisfaction and expressing the behaviour of multidisciplinary systems using the notion of energy. It employs fuzzy rule-bases, membership functions and parametric connectives in fuzzy logic to formalize subjective aspects of design, resulting in a two-phase simplification of the multi-objective constrained optimization of a design process. The methodology attempts to find a pareto-optimal solution for the design problem. In the primary phase of the methodology, a fuzzy-logic model is utilized to identify a region in the design space that contains the pareto-optimal design state, and a proper initial state is suggested for the optimization in the secondary phase, where the pareto-optimal solution is found. Finally, the impact of the designer's subjective attitude on the design is adjusted based on a system performance by utilizing an energy-based model of multidisciplinary systems. As an application, it is shown that the design of a five-degree-of-freedom industrial robot manipulator can be enhanced by using the methodology.

Fuzzy AHP and FPP methods are used to determine the relative weights of multiple evaluation criteria and synthesize the ratings of candidate aeroengines. Aggregated the evaluators' attitude toward preference, then TOPSIS is employed to obtain a crisp overall performance value for each alternative to make a final decision. To illustrate how the approach is used for the aeroengine health assessment problem, an empirical study of a real case involving eleven evaluation criteria and ten initial commercial aeroengines of Air China Ltd. is conducted.

Different methodologies exist to enable computer models to accomplish agent collaboration. Reputation models emerge as promising methods to control the communication framework between social agents. In this study we evaluate the social behaviour of agents guided by simulated awareness of self and others, where ethical constraints, stress avoidance and emotional interference play a role in the decision making process. A multi-agent based graph colouring model is formulated and extended to enable the social paradigm. Experiments using standard sets present an application neutral platform in order to study the effects of conscience decision making of the social agents on problem convergence when solving the graph colouring problem.	agent-based model;computer simulation;conscience;experiment;graph coloring;interference (communication);multi-agent system;programming paradigm;reputation system	Shamual F.

Several propositions of construction are available in literature but generally, these methods do not consider the belief masses on compound hypotheses and do not exploit all the strengths of the theory. In this article, we propose two methods of grouping hypotheses allowing to reduce the number of focal elements during the construction of mass functions. The first one is based on a well-known approach in cartography and geoinformation fields: Jenks' method. The second one is based on information criteria. We present and confront both methods. Results in a forensic entomology application are then presented.	cartography;focal (programming language);geographic information system;iterative method;jenks natural breaks optimization;modeller;state space	Alexandre Veremme;Daniel Dupont;Eric Lefevre;David Mercier	2009	2009 12th International Conference on Information Fusion		geography;artificial intelligence;data mining;communication	Robotics	-8.657889850704017	-22.208398549711458	67508

A predator-prey model with epidemic prey and staged structure in the predators, where the predators are assumed to keep constant preference probability of predation on susceptible/infected prey, is formulated to study the hunting strategies of predators for maximum surviving rate as well as maximum density. Given that the disease is endemic among prey before the invasion of predators, global dynamics of the model are obtained and threshold dynamics determined by the predator's net reproductive number RH are established: the predators go extinct if RH   1. As an application, the hunting strategies of the predators for the maximum RH are studied, and it is shown that the predators should only hunt the susceptible prey when the disease is just slightly endemic, while if the disease is seriously endemic, they should only hunt the infected prey. Numerical simulations are performed to verify/support the theoretical results and to consider the hunting strategies of predators for their maximum density, for which it is shown that the predators should keep some proper preference probability on both susceptible and infected prey.	prey	Yang Lu;Dan Li;Shengqiang Liu	2016	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2016.03.005	predation	Theory	-13.604782645030589	-17.01016107810891	67514

The group decision and negotiation process is bared on the concepts of fuzzy set theory and hierarchical decision analysis. Individual linguistic assessments of criteria and the decision alternatives versus the selection criteria are aggregated to obtain fuzzy group preference indices. Through this system, different rating attitudes of the decision makers and their fuzzy assessments can be taken into account in the aggregation process to facilitate more accurate and convincing negotiation. A fleet selection problem is used to illustrate the proposed system.<>		Peri H.

Recent attention to social identity in consumer behavior indicates that individuals avoid products that might signal membership in an outgroup. Yet the population-level consequences of adoption as identity signaling are largely unknown. Whereas previous work has focused on asymmetric attraction and repulsion among groups with different social identities, here we consider the spread of innovations in a structured population in which there are multiple groups who don't want to be mistaken for one another, using both analytical and agent-based modeling. We investigate how identity signaling influences overall patterns of adoption in structured populations, and consider the role of structural factors such as demographic skew and communication scale on diffusion dynamics. We find that as products become emergent social markers, aversion to outgroup-associated products can decrease overall patterns of adoption and promote the extent to which uptake of a product is locally polarized. When communications are long-range, polarization can become global. This research has particular relevance to widely beneficial but identity-relevant products, such as green technologies, where overall levels of adoption determine the positive benefits that accrue to society at large.	agent-based model;emergence;outgroup (cladistics);polarization (waves);population;relevance;risk aversion;social engineering (security)	Paul E.

In order to evaluate the accounting information quality, this paper proposed an approach to the evaluation of the quality of accounting information based on relative entropy in fuzzy linguistic environments. Firstly, the accounting information quality evaluation criteria are constructed not only from the quality of the accounting information content but also from the accounting information generation environment. Considering that the rating values with respect to the criteria are in linguistic forms with different granularities, the method to deal with the linguistic rating values is given. In the method, the linguistic terms are modeled with the 2-tuple linguistic model. Relative entropy is used to calculate the information consistency, which is used to derive the weight of experts and criteria. Finally, the example is given to illustrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed method.	corporate governance;information quality;kullback–leibler divergence;self-information	Ming Li;Xiaoli Ning;Mingzhu Li;Yingcheng Xu	2017	Entropy	10.3390/e19040152	computer science;knowledge management;data mining;mathematics;management science;kullback–leibler divergence;statistics	Web+IR	-4.643482945814406	-18.494687071878438	67768

The hierarchical system of parameters for virtual team performance evaluation is elaborated by applying expert survey. The aggregated measure of performance of virtual project team is derived from twelve parameters assigned to three categories (team, task and interaction). The experimental research is based on fuzzy analysis of interaction data of virtual teams which worked on implementation of three software solution projects. The research results provide evidence for the feasibility of using the proposed method as the tool for virtual project managers seeking to improve their leadership techniques, and to derive parameters for performance evaluation based on intelligent computing methods.	algorithm;bottom-up parsing;computation;experience;experiment;expert system;fuzzy rule;input/output;performance evaluation;top-down and bottom-up design;virtual reality	Dalia Kriksciuniene;Sandra Strigunaite	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27260-8_25	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;management science	Visualization	-7.05061728481578	-17.687181936023215	67872

In such sharp-end decision regimes, standard rule-based decision support systems do not capture the complexity of the situation. At the same time, traditional risk analysis is of little use due to variability in the specific circumstances. How then, can an organisation provide assistance to, e.g. pilots in dealing with such emergencies? A method called ‘contingent risk and decision analysis’ is presented, to provide decision support for decisions under variable circumstances and short available time scales. The method consists of nine steps of definition, modelling, analysis and criteria definition to be performed ‘off-line’ by analysts, and procedure generation to transform the analysis result into an operational decision aid. Examples of pilots’ decisions in response to sudden vibration in offshore helicopter transport method are used to illustrate the approach. q 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In the competitive market, it is very important to be able to sell rather than produce. Nowadays, marketing is customeroriented and aims to meet the needs and expectations of customers to increase their satisfaction. While creating a marketing strategy, an enterprise must consider many factors. Which is why, the process can and should be considered as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) case. In this study, marketing strategies and marketing decisions in the new-product-development process has been analyzed in a macro level. To deal quantitatively with imprecision or uncertainty, fuzzy sets theory has been used throughout the analysis.	common criteria;fuzzy set	Tuncay Gürbüz;Yildiz Esra Albayrak;Elif Alaybeyoglu	2014	Int.

Based on this fact, the evacuation crowd is divided into small groups based on the rationality, and then the impact of rationality and ratios of small groups on the behavioral evolution is explored. Among the crowds, the rational small group allocates their investment based on the quality of game groups. By means of Monte-Carlo simulation, it is found that rational allocation will promote the cooperation, which concisely introduces the Matthew effect. The higher the rational degree is, the more significant cooperation promotion effect will be, and the decreasing of corresponding phase transition points will also be more remarkable. Then, the effect of the ratio of small group 1 is discussed. The results show that the fraction of cooperation in the crowd is negatively correlated with the ratio of small group 1. Lastly, the phase diagram for fraction of cooperation corresponding to different rationality and ratios of small group 1 is depicted by scanning of parameter spaces extensively. The phase diagram vividly shows the roles of rationality and ratio of small group 1. In conclusion, this paper reveals the behavioral evolution in evacuation crowd in some extent by introducing the heterogeneous rationality of small groups. Simultaneously, the framework of this paper is instructional for the future study of the behavioral evolution in evacuation crowd with multi small groups.	rationality	Keke Huang;Xiaoping Zheng;Yeqing Yang;Tao Wang	2015	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2015.05.065	simulation	Robotics	-14.117764923141602	-14.503387035582366	68600

The presented multi-agent system can solve these simulation tasks using distributed heterogeneous computation resources with the objective to reduce the calculation time.

Decision rules are heuristics-based triggering mechanisms that help determine the ideal conditions for exercising flexibility in system operations. In contrast to standard ROA based on dynamic programming, decision rules can be parameterized as decision variables, and therefore capture the decision-making process based on specific realizations of the main uncertainty drivers affecting system performance. Similar to standard ROA, a decision rule approach can be used to quantify the benefits of flexibility in early conceptual design studies, and help identifying the best flexible systems design concepts before a more detailed design phase. While many studies demonstrate expected lifecycle performance improvement stemming from a decision-rule based approach as compared to standard design and ROA techniques, very few studies show experimentally their effectiveness in managing flexible engineering systems. This paper presents the results of controlled human-subject experiments involving thirty-two participants evaluating a training procedure in a simulation game environment. The controlled study show that a stochastically optimal flexible strategy combined with an initial policy for the system configuration can improve significantly the expected coverage rate of medical emergencies. These provide insights for further research, development and evaluation of flexible systems design and management strategies for complex engineering systems.	complex systems;rule 90;systems design	Michel-Alexandre Cardin;Yixin Jiang;Terence Lim	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-49103-5_13	decision analysis;systems engineering;knowledge management;management science	SE	-9.716043464919332	-14.832954445578922	70021

Although future concentrations, damages and costs are unknown, it is widely recognized that major emissions reduction efforts are needed. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol promoted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, aimed at fighting global warming. The main goal is “stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system” [9]. According to the International Energy Agency [1], energy efficient in buildings, industrial processes and transportation could reduce the world’s energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help controlling global emissions of greenhouse gases. The report [1] describes a series of scenarios showing how key energy technologies can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas which is most responsible for climate change. Of the four primary GHG under scrutiny, carbon dioxide (CO2), and the need to lower carbon emissions in general, is of paramount concern. It is estimated that transportation activities are responsible for approximately 25% to 30% of total U.S. GHG emissions, with the on-highway commercial truck market accounting for over 45% of transportation GHG. However, the transportation sector emissions remain almost entirely unaddressed with respect to GHG and CO2 reduction.

Societal expectations, such as accident avoidance and adherence to traffic laws, have their foundation in core moral issues found in philosophy and ethics. Thus, engineers designing control algorithms for automated vehicles can benefit from applying principles and frameworks from philosophy to drive design decisions. In particular, we use a set of ethical frameworks to map design decisions for a model predictive control problem to philosophical principles. Deontology, a rule-based ethical framework, motivates the development of constraints on the system. Consequentialism, a cost-based ethical framework, motivates the construction of the objective function. The choice of weights is guided by the concepts of virtue ethics and role morality to determine behavior for different types of vehicles. The strong link between ethical principles and actual vehicle behavior developed through this approach is demonstrated experimentally by implementing alternative design choices on a test vehicle in a simple driving scenario.	algorithm;cartography;experiment;logic programming;loss function;optimization problem	Sarah M.

Recently, traditional learning classifier system are challenged by changes in the context. In this paper, an anticipatory agent based on the Anticipatory Learning Classifier System (ACS) for learning in changing environments is presented. This research aims to develop an agent learning architecture using anticipatory system that will enable intelligent agent to be able to detect environmental changes, adapt functionality at run-time to achieve goal. For achieving the intended target, an extension to the ACS framework called “Greedy Covering” to the ACS framework have been proposed. The novelty of the approach is in determining the changes in the environment and to generate optimal rules to adapt and reestablish the optimal policy to reach the goal state. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on several synthetic maze design and simulate a variety of changing environments. Experiment results indicate that up to 65% changes in an environment the ACS with the greedy covering can reestablish the optimal performance without increasing the number of classifiers.	agent-based model;anticipation (artificial intelligence);denial-of-service attack;greedy algorithm;intelligent agent;learning classifier system;programming paradigm;sensor;simulation;synthetic intelligence	Md.

A hybrid approach for evaluation and selection is presented using an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for clustering, data envelopment analysis (DEA) for efficiency, and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for importance. First, industrial taxonomy and EM algorithms are used to cluster the suppliers. Then, DEA is utilized to calculate internal operation efficiency. Next, AHP is applied to assess external function importance. After the weighted efficiency and importance scores are combined, the suppliers for improvement and strategic improving direction are determined based on a quadrant and diamond graph analysis. Finally, based on the supplier clusters, the effective stepwise benchmarking paths are presented with improvement strategies, and the final target indicators are obtained through DEA projection analysis. The proposed method is successfully demonstrated on 63 tier-one suppliers in the Korean automobile industry using three-year panel data from 2012 to 2014.	cluster analysis;stepwise regression	Sung Chul Park;Jang Hee Lee	2018	JORS	10.1057/s41274-017-0203-x	diamond graph;operations management;benchmarking;analytic hierarchy process;cluster analysis;computer science;supplier evaluation;expectation–maximization algorithm;data envelopment analysis;panel data	NLP	-6.5926815069640385	-17.27796270045765	70207

The process of creating and evaluating projects is an initial activity in implementing six sigma. This paper aims at proposing a comprehensive methodology for the evaluation and selection of the six sigma projects. For the evaluation of projects, reviewing the literature and decision team’s opinion, we identified three main categories of criteria including business criteria, technological & process criteria and financial criteria which contain eight sub-criteria. For deriving the overall utility of projects, we designed an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system which is capable to consider interrelations among criteria. Then, applying a fuzzy weighted additive goal programming model, we obtained the optimal portfolio of projects which should be implemented. Finally, we applied the proposed model in a leading company in Iran to illustrate the applicability of the model. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

8de26f13dfb1c2c5de95128b2e38b3e3a8de3382	attributed probabilistic p systems and their application to the modelling of social interactions in primates		We propose a variant of probabilistic P Systems, Attributed Probabilistic P systems (APP systems), in which objects are annotated with attributes. We use APP systems for modelling social behaviours of some species of primates. In this context attributes can represent position of the animals in the environment, age of the animal, dominance level, aggressiveness, etc. As in standard P systems, the dynamics of the system is described by multiset rewrite rules that are applied in a maximally parallel way. Probabilities of rule application, in a maximal step, are computed according to weight functions associated to rules. As an application, we develop models to compare despotic and egalitarian behaviours on different species of primates.	agent-based model;ecosystem;interaction;maximal set;p system;parallel computing;population;rewrite (programming);rewriting;social system;weight function	Roberto Barbuti;Alessandro Bompadre;Pasquale Bove;Paolo Milazzo;Giovanni Pardini	2015		10.1007/978-3-662-49224-6_15	natural language processing;artificial intelligence;machine learning	AI	-18.039995164046175	-16.415579025986133	70552

The system was based on several types of models centered on indicator analysis. Being the groundwork of the system, management of cases (historical accidents) and chemicals is introduced in detail. The former is data source from where indicators are built with some data-mining methods such as analytical hierarchy process (AHP), grey correlation analysis, fuzzy logic, neural network etc. while the latter provides basic characteristic information of chemicals for vulnerability analysis-an important component for analyzing impact of chemicals on health and environment in risk assessment operations. A geographical information system (GIS) platform was interfaced to the system. The strong capabilities of spatial data manipulation provided by GIS facilitate the construction of the case base. The design and implementation of the system are presented. The system is not only a practically applicable tool but also an infrastructure for academic research of risk assessment technologies and methodologies of chemical places.	analytical hierarchy;artificial neural network;data mining;fuzzy logic;geographic information system;risk assessment;software system	Shaobo Zhong;Changhong He;Zhenbin Wang;Yue Guan;Chenglong Li;Yi Liu	2009	2009 Sixth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/FSKD.2009.789	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;geographic information system;software system	SE	-10.017827976119865	-21.14957089906225	71144

The modeling and inference limitations met in FCMs, especially in situations with strong nonlinearity and temporal phenomena, pushed towards DCNs; their theoretical framework is scheduled to confront the preceding weaknesses and offer wider possibilities in causal structures management. Trying to contribute to the enhancement of DCNs, at first, systemic and environmental metaphors are introduced with practical mathematical formalisms and generalized nomenclature. Nonlinear and asymmetric cause-effect relationships, decaying mechanisms, inertial forces, diminishing effects and biases formulate a powerful set of adaptive characteristics that strengthen the operational behavior of DCNs. Second, the strategic reorientation of DCNs is attempted as generalized approximation tools. This new strategic option is verified not only in classical function approximation tests, but also in the challenging area of securities markets. The platform of evaluation of DCNs involves comparisons with a linear multiple regression model, a feed-forward neural network trained with both back-propagation and evolution strategies, a radial basis function network, and an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Through the experiments for short-term stock price predictions, multiple issues are analyzed not only about the role of diverse DCN parameters, but also about the given problem of financial markets modeling and forecasting. Simulations distinguish DCNs as a strong methodology with noticeable adaptability in complicated patterns and broad generalization capabilities while, at the same time, the all-embracing outcomes support previous findings of partially random walk phenomena in short-term stock market forecasting attempts.	cognitive network;complex systems;time series	Dimitris E.

This added complexity makes it difficult to study and model AIDS and its dynamics. AIDS is therefore a natural candidate to be modeled using agent-based modeling, a paradigm well-known for modeling Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). While agent-based models are well-known to effectively model CAS, often times models can tend to be ambiguous and using only using text-based specifications (such as ODD) making models difficult to be replicated. Previous work has shown how formal specification may be used in conjunction with agent-based modeling to develop models of various CAS. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no such model has been developed in conjunction with AIDS. In this paper, we present a Formal Agent-Based Simulation modeling framework (FABS-AIDS) for an AIDS-based CAS. FABS-AIDS employs the use of a formal specification model in conjunction with an agent-based model to reduce ambiguity as well as improve clarity in the model definition. The proposed model demonstrates the effectiveness of using formal specification in conjunction with agent-based simulation for developing models of CAS in general and, social network-based agent-based models, in particular.

It is known that there exists a case that characteristic of the software failure-occurrence or the fault-detection phenomenon is changed notably in a testing-phase or an operational phase due to changes of factors influencing on the software reliability growth process. Taking into consideration of the effect of the change in software reliability growth modeling is expected to conduct more accurate software reliability assessment because it is said that such approach enables us to conduct more plausible software reliability assessment reflecting an actual testing-environment. Especially in this paper, we develop exponential-type software hazard rate models with effect of change-point, and discuss change-point detection methods for applying our model to quantitative software reliability assessment. Finally, we conduct goodness-of-fit comparisons of our models with existing software hazard rate models, and show numerical examples for software reliability assessment based on our specific change-point models by using actual data.	mathematical model;numerical analysis;software bug;software quality;software reliability testing;time complexity	Shinji Inoue;Shiho Hayashida;Shigeru Yamada	2013	2013 IEEE 37th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference	10.1109/COMPSAC.2013.44	reliability engineering;data modeling;software sizing;hazard;computer science;systems engineering;software reliability testing;computational model;change detection;goal-driven software development process;software quality;software metric;statistics;software quality analyst	SE	-5.336102120420051	-12.088032318450344	72550

bd64c3d2104b337eaebe7fd5435fa9e8ffcc9b22	a decision support tool to enhance agricultural growth in the mékrou river basin (west africa)		Abstract We describe in this paper the implementation of E-Water, an open software Decision Support System (DSS), designed to help local managers assess the Water Energy Food Environment (WEFE) nexus. E-Water aims at providing optimal management solutions to enhance food crop production at river basin level. The DSS was applied in the transboundary Mekrou river basin, shared among Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. The primary sector for local economy in the region is agriculture, contributing significantly to income generation and job creation. Fostering the productivity of regional agricultural requires the intensification of farming practices, promoting additional inputs (mainly nutrient fertilizers and water irrigation) but, also, a more efficient allocation of cropland. In order to cope with the heterogeneity of data, and the analyses and issues required by the WEFE nexus approach, our DSS integrates the following modules: (1) the EPIC biophysical agricultural model; (2) a simplified regression metamodel, linking crop production with external inputs; (3) a linear programming and a multiobjective genetic algorithm optimization routines for finding efficient agricultural strategies; and (4) a user-friendly interface for input/output analysis and visualization. To test the main features of the DSS, we apply it to various real and hypothetical scenarios in the Mekrou river basin. The results obtained show how food unavailability due to insufficient local production could be reduced by, approximately, one third by enhancing the application and optimal distribution of fertilizers and irrigation. That would also affect the total income of the farming sector, eventually doubling it in the best case scenario. Furthermore, the combination of optimal agricultural strategies and modified optimal cropland allocation across the basin would bring additional moderate increases in food self-sufficiency, and more substantial gains in the total agricultural income. The proposed software framework proves to be effective, enabling decision makers to identify efficient and site-specific agronomic management strategies for nutrients and water. Such practices would augment crop productivity, which, in turn, would allow to cope with increasing future food demands, and find a balanced use of natural resources, also taking other economic sectors—like livestock, urban or energy—into account.	decision support system	Angel Udías;Marco Pastori;Alexandre Di Iorio;Cesar Carmona Moreno;Abdou Ali;Luigi Cattaneo;Javier Cano	2018	Computers and Electronics in Agriculture	10.1016/j.compag.2018.09.037	control engineering;software framework;decision support system;irrigation;environmental economics;agriculture;primary sector of the economy;engineering;nexus (standard);natural resource;drainage basin	HCI	-13.611217197666571	-21.71425032009588	72768

In most artificial society discrete-event simulation models, synchronous time evolution is used to drive the actions and interactions of the landscape and agents. Although for some applications synchronous time evolution is the correct modeling approach, other applications are better suited for asynchronous time evolution. In this paper we demonstrate that very different behavior can be observed in a typical artificial society model if agent events occur asynchronously. Using an adaptation of the artificial society model defined by Epstein and Axtell, we describe the implementation of asynchronous time evolution in a discrete-event simulation model. With output from this model, we show that the use of asynchronous time evolution can eliminate potential simulation artifacts produced using synchronous time evolution. Since the use of discrete-event simulation can produce an associated loss in computational performance, we also discuss means of improving the performance of the artificial society simulation model. We provide results demonstrating that acceptable computational performance for asynchronous time evolution can be achieved using an appropriate event list implementation."""

Thus many transportation agencies have persevered in their efforts not only to alleviate such problems, but also to minimize social costs. However, the complex nature of such problems has strongly hindered transportation agencies’ ability to consider an integrated framework, which combines land use and transportation planning. Both urban travel and land use are too strongly interrelated to be separately considered. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) has stipulated that transportation planning be a systems approach considering both environment and performance concurrently, requiring that planners consider transportation planning in conjunction with land use planning. ISTEA necessitates a more comprehensive, multimodal, systems management approach to transportation planning. As a result, many metropolitan planning organizations have considered both land use and development in their long term transportation planning as well as short term transportation improvement programs (FHWA, 1998; Kaiser et al., 1995). For many years, transportation planners have attempted to develop integrated land use-transportation models in various modeling frameworks. However, there have been few successful implementations of the integrated, operational land use-transportation model due to some critical problems, such as lack of necessary transportation network and socioeconomic data, labor-intensive data operation, and difficult model formulation. In order to overcome such problems, this study has explored GIS technologies, which can possibly support the development of an integrated, operational land use-transportation model.	geographic information system;multimodal interaction;network congestion;systems management	Jinsoo You;Tschangho John Kim	1999	Journal of Geographical Systems	10.1007/s101090050016	decision-making;land use;simulation;demand forecasting;geography;graphical user interface;geographic information system;travel behavior;procedural modeling	AI	-15.352423404743758	-23.33065601494758	73401

On closer inspection, however, this distinction is not as clear cut as usually assumed. For example, when navigating complex urban landscapes, pedestrians frequently traverse tunnels, enclosed footbridges or partially roofed courtyards. In this paper, we investigate this type of spaces between indoor and outdoor areas. We present an initial definition of transitional spaces based on a conceptual analysis, and then report on results from an empirical study with 103 pedestrians, whom we interviewed in an urban area. A statistical and linguistic analysis of the outcomes of the study provides evidence for the existence of transitional spaces and their use. The outcomes also support an initial set of characteristics and properties that further clarify these areas. The results pave the way for the further investigation of transitional spaces, e.g. in terms of providing effective navigation support through them.	spaces;traverse	Christian Kray;Holger Fritze;Thore Fechner;Angela Schwering;Rui Li;Vanessa Joy A.

It is generally assumed that these data, once generated, are complete and rife with necessary information for making decisions. The reality is, however, that these data are not error free. Common errors observed in these data include false positives and false negatives. Given that these data are among the set of primary inputs for decision-making purposes, the read-rate accuracy is of paramount importance for effectively managing supply chains incorporating such data. Although there are means by which the RFID tag read rate could be improved to a certain extent, the errors in read rate cannot be completely eliminated, and decision makers are left to deal with such data while managing the supply chain. We present and illustrate few algorithms that can be used to reduce false read rates. We consider models for filtering data that are already being gathered in RFID systems and utilize it to improve read-rate accuracy. We implement the proposed models and illustrate their performance.	algorithm;rife;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification	Tony Yu-Ju Tu;Selwyn Piramuthu	2011	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)	10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2054079	radio-frequency identification;decision support system;telecommunications;computer science;data mining;supply chain;radio frequency	Metrics	-10.696874876766595	-13.469704056427313	73790

The map was developed by considering the subsystems on which the climate equilibrium depends, and by aggregating different experts opinions over this framework. The resulting network was characterized by graph indexes and used for the simulation and analysis of hidden patterns and model sensitivity. Then, linguistic variables were used to fuzzify the edges and aggregated to produce an overall linguistic weight for each one. The resulting linguistic weights were defuzzified using the center of gravity technique, and the current state of the Earth climate system was simulated and discussed. Finally, a nonlinear Hebbian learning algorithm was used for updating the edges of the map until a desired state was reached, defined by target values for the concepts. The results are discussed to explore possible policy implementation, as well as environmental decision making.

3475cc51120744e05e2e6cfd0855252bbe6dec7b	a knowledge based decision support system for computer performance management	performance management;support system;knowledge base	Computer systems managers make decisions about hardware and software selection, performance evaluation, capacity planning, and other resource variables on the basis of factual data, accounting data, subjective judgements, and assumptions about the resource consumption of the jobs being run. The importance of computer resource planning calls for effective support methods. A Knowledge-Based DSS (KBDSS) will be able to assist managers in making these policy decisions by utilizing knowledge of the existing configuration and its capabilities, the organizational computing environment, available external resources, and their suppliers. Combining procedural and declarative methods, such a KBDSS may provide early warning of possible bottlenecks, forecast growth of hardware usage, and employ knowledge based inferencing to suggest suitable remedial actions to the systems manager. This paper presents a KBDSS for supporting computer resource planning decisions using a procedural/declarative framework, and illustrates the system's usage aspects.	computer performance;decision support system	Bay Arinze;Magid Igbaria;Lawrence F.

We considered a fixed population divided in three compartments, namely honest tax payers, tax evaders and a third class between the mentioned two, which we call susceptibles to become evaders. The transitions among those compartments are ruled by probabilities, similarly to a model of epidemic spreading. These probabilities model social interactions among the individuals, as well as the government’s fiscalization. We simulate the model on fully-connected graphs, as well as on scale-free and random complex networks. For the fully-connected and random graph cases we observe that the emergence of tax evaders in the population is associated with an active-absorbing nonequilibrium phase transition, that is absent in scale-free networks.	complex network;emergence;evasion (network security);interaction;random graph;simulation	Rafael M.

10410b49904184661927747befa479e0d7c6a512	a conceptual approach to model co-evolution of urban structures	nlin ao;physics soc ph	Urban structures encompass settlements, characterized by the spatial distribution of built-up areas, and also transportation structures, to connect these built-up areas. These two structures are very different in their origin and function, fulfilling complementary needs: (1) to access space and (2) to occupy space. Their evolution cannot be understood by looking at the dynamics of urban aggregations and transportation systems separately. Instead, existing built-up areas feed back on the further development of transportation structures, and the availability of the latter feeds back on the future growth of urban aggregations. To model this co-evolution, we propose an agent-based approach that builds on existing agent-based models for the evolution of trail systems and urban settlements. The key element in these separate approaches is a generalized communication of agents by means of an adaptive landscape. This landscape is only generated by the agents, but once it exists, it feeds back on their further actions. The emerging trail system or urban aggregation results as a selforganized structure from these collective interactions. In our co-evolutionary approach, we couple these two separate models by means of meta-agents that represent humans with their different demands for housing and mobility. We characterize our approach as a statistical ensemble approach, which allows to capture the potential of urban evolution in a bottom-up manner, but can be validated against empirical observations.	agent-based model;aggregate function;bottom-up proteomics;evolution;interaction;iterative and incremental development;social network aggregation;statistical machine translation;top-down and bottom-up design;urban ecosystem	Frank Schweitzer;Vahan Nanumyan	2016	CoRR	10.1177/0266351116642075	structural engineering;simulation;engineering;civil engineering;mathematics	ML	-15.542734802641785	-20.641101917253675	74596
2bb561759febcc325a14e6c6ec5bf274b2e1b897	a two-staged clusteringalgorithm for multiple scales		Cluster analysis is a data mining technique used to identify hidden patterns within data. Most clustering algorithms treat different fields of data with equal weights and calculate the “distance” using the same method. They ignore the fact that different fields of data have different scales; therefore, the “distance” should be calculated differently. This study incorporated a traditional clustering algorithm with expert subjective judgment, and used different methods to calculate the degree of similarity for four different scales -nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio. This study proposes a two-staged clustering algorithm to improve the process. In the first stage, training data was used to determine the parameters that improved clustering quality. In the second stage, different methods were used to calculate the degree of similarity for four different scales of data and treated different fields with unequal weights. To evaluate the outcomes of this proposed clustering method, four standard data sets were used for testing. They were the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data, Contraceptive Method Choice Data, Iris Education Data, and Balance Scale Weight & Distance Data. The results were positive; the algorithm using multi-scales resulted in a better quality clustering. Also, the algorithm incorporating expert subjective weighting had better accuracy in clustering.	algorithm;apply;cluster analysis;data mining;electronic business;experiment;k-means clustering;mathematical optimization;ordinal data;subject-matter expert	Chien-Lung Chan;Rung-Ting Chien	2005	IJEBM			ML	-5.3828323457981275	-19.683752874787643	74615

Commonly available population data from Census is constrained both in space and time and does not capture the population dynamics as functions of space and time. This imposes a significant negative consequence on the fidelity of event based simulation models with sensitive space-time resolution. Such limitations, to a large degree, can be overcome by developing population data with a finer resolution in both space and time at sub-Census levels. Geodemographic data at such scales will represent a more realistic non-uniform distribution of population. Using an innovative approach with Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has made significant progress towards solving this problem. ORNL, as part of its LandScan global population project, has developed the finest resolution global and US population distribution models. This talk will describe ongoing development of the computational framework for spatial data integration and modeling framework for LandScan. Discussions will cover development of algorithms to utilize population infrastructure datasets (such as residences, business locations, academic institutions, correctional facilities, and public offices) along with behavioral or activity-based mobility datasets for representing temporal dynamics of population. In addition, we will discuss development and integration of transportation, physical and behavioral science computational algorithms; the integration of these models that address different scales and different time frames; and the development of dynamic optimization routines to take advantage of real-time data from sensor networks.	algorithm;database;dynamic programming;geographic information system;image resolution;mathematical optimization;population dynamics;real-time data;simulation;social dynamics	Budhendra L.

Therefore, to reveal its evolution rules through understanding the dynamic process of trigger diffusion for trust damage, this study employs the multi-agent technology to establish SRQ simulation model, and simulates the dynamic process by changing the initial value of the related parameters of two key agents. The results show that trigger diffusion for trust damage of individual donor has significant effects of time interval and dynamic evolution, and this can be categorised into five stages. Besides, in the process of trigger diffusion, individual donors will tend to polarise and herd with informational cascades to a certain extent, these effects will be closely related to some important attributes such as ambiguity and diffusion strength of the trigger, and the credibility, speed and transparency of the non-profits disclosing the trigger information.	multi-agent system;social computing	Jundong Hou;Renbin Xiao	2016	IJWMC	10.1504/IJWMC.2016.10003226	simulation;computer science;computer security;social computing	AI	-16.478666611504735	-15.791022844866708	75226

Although the probability of occurrence of accidental events may still be considered rather low, the possible consequences of such events in long tunnels can be catastrophic, therefore raising the overall risk to levels that may be no more acceptable. The scope of this paper is to illustrate the state-of-practice related to risk analysis of long railway tunnels. First, ambitious tunnel projects are briefly reviewed. The applicable risk-analysis procedures are then described and discussed. The problem of risk appraisal is addressed and quantitative target safety levels are proposed.

These functional components to landscape modelling are developed in a modular way and are linked together in a modelling framework that performs dynamic simulation.

Representing flows as lines embedded in geographic space has commonly been used to map transport flows, especially when geographic patterns are important as they are when characterising cities or managing transportation. However, for larger numbers of flows, this approach requires careful design to avoid problems of occlusion, salience bias and information overload. Driven by the requirements identified by users and managers of the London Bicycle Hire scheme we present three methods of representation of bicycle hire use and travel patterns. Flow maps with curved flow symbols are used to show overviews in flow structures. Gridded views of docking station location that preserve geographic relationships are used to explore docking station status over space and time in a graphically efficient manner. Origin-Destination maps that visualise the OD matrix directly while maintaining geographic context are used to provide visual details on demand. We use these approaches to identify changes in travel behaviour over space and time, to aid station rebalancing and to provide a framework for incorporating travel modelling and simulation.	docking (molecular);docking station;embedded system;information overload;map;requirement;simulation	Jo Wood;Aidan Slingsby;Jason Dykes	2011	Cartographica	10.3138/carto.46.4.239	visualization;geography;computer science;sociology;operations research;cartography	HCI	-15.007560001835351	-23.663636516424813	75967

We explore the role played by initial representations held by the learners in coupled learning processes using a formal agent-based model. We find that initial representations have important consequences for the success of the coupled learning process, particularly when communication is constrained and individual rates of learning are high. Under these conditions, initial representations that generate incorrect beliefs can outperform one that does not discriminate among alternatives, or even a mix of correct and incorrect representations among the learners. We draw implications for the design of coupled learning processes in organizations.

In this new model, the fast evacuation, going with the crowd and the panic behaviors are considered and the corresponding moving rules are defined. The model is applied to a stadium and simulations are carried out to analyze the spacetime evacuation efficiency by different behaviors. The simulation results show that the behaviors of going with the crowd and panic will slow down the evacuation process while quickest evacuation psychology can accelerate the process, and panic is helpful to some extent. The setting of parameters is discussed to obtain best performance. The simulation results can offer effective suggestions for evacuees under emergency situation.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;simulation;synthetic intelligence	Xinlu Zong;Hui Xu;Shengwu Xiong;Pengfei Duan	2014	2014 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2014.6900253	multi-swarm optimization;simulation;artificial intelligence;operations research;metaheuristic	EDA	-18.29547205755399	-22.111980912194177	76151

In this paper, a fuzzy logic approach is proposed to describe crowd evacuation behaviors, taking into account the effect of assailants. First, the microscopic pedestrian model and the assailant model are developed according to their different intentions in evacuation scenarios. Pedestrians are further divided into three categories depending upon whether they are affected by assailants. The individual's behaviors are determined by the integration of recommendations of local obstacle-avoiding behavior, regional path-searching behavior, and global goal-seeking behavior with adjustable weighting factors, which are automatically adjusted based on the perceptual information obtained from the complex interaction with surrounding environments. Then, the proposed pedestrian model is validated by comparing the simulated fundamental diagram with a large variety of empirical and experimental data. Finally, simulations in a hall with a single exit are implemented. It is shown that the model can truly reappear typical collective phenomena such as “arching and clogging” and “faster-is-slower effect.” The variations of the model and scenario parameters, such as pedestrian's desired speed, exit width, assailant's desired speed, and duration of attack, greatly influence the evacuation efficiency. In addition, a novel “circuity phenomenon,” i.e., pedestrians will give up the direction of goal when they encounter assailants or they see assailants and, at the same time, perceive a very crowded exit, is observed in crowd evacuation simulations.	diagram;fuzzy logic;simulation	Min Zhou;Hairong Dong;Ding Wen;Xiuming Yao;Xubin Sun	2016	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2016.2521783	computer vision;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;mathematical model;statistics	Robotics	-18.989616700306748	-21.439924156062983	76214

Having the network structure represented in an explicit manner within the extended network enhances expressiveness and enables to model adaptation of the base network by dynamics within the reified network. It is shown how the approach provides a unified modeling perspective on representing network adaptation principles across different domains. This is illustrated by a number of known network adaptation principles such as for Hebbian learning in Mental Networks and for network evolution based on homophily in Social Networks.

However, these methods still only evaluated from risks viewpoint while ignoring the effectiveness of corrective actions from utility viewpoint. In practical, it may not reach significant corrective effectiveness because of the corrective efficiency if corrective action is ignored. In addition, corrective actions may be treated as a complex system; they may not be simple and have an independent relationship with each other; the interdependence relationship; and the sequence or structure of hierarchy; even feedback relationship may exist. This study develops a fuzzy interpretive structural model in order to evaluate the structure of hierarchy and interdependence of corrective actions, and integrating the analytic network process with decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory to take account into the causal relationship and influence strength of corrective actions to obtain the more accuracy weights. At last, a case study implemented to demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively circumvents the drawbacks of traditional risk priority number method and adapts flexibly to real-world situations.

Focus of this paper is on measurement of various software project risks, and representation of these various risks through a variety of risk radars. The paper first examines software project risks reported in literature and classifies software project risks into major categories. We then discuss methods that can be used to quantitatively assess these risks; and introduce several new concepts such as fuzzy risk TOPSIS, logistic and lag indicators of software project risks. A comparison of these methods is presented. We also introduce an innovative framework for risk reporting that has been named the 'risk radar'. Utility of 'radar' format to graphically depict software project risks, and its effectiveness as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method is illustrated through examples that demonstrate the use of different radar formats.	radar;software project management	J.

As truck selection is a very crucial problem for the land transportation companies, a systematic and scientific approach is necessary for its solution. A systematic methodology is proposed in the present study by integrating ''fuzzy DEMATEL'' and ''fuzzy hierarchical TOPSIS''. The proposed method makes use of fuzzy DEMATEL method for evaluating the weights of the criteria and hierarchical fuzzy TOPSIS method for assessing the alternatives according to criteria. The steps of the method are described first then a case study is presented in the paper.		Adil Baykasoglu;Vahit Kaplanoglu;Zeynep D. U. Durmusoglu;Cenk Sahin	2013	Expert Syst.

81acb2f6ed08c2c2778060e27a8559568bf008b2	planning optimal path networks using dynamic behavioral modeling		Mistakes in pedestrian infrastructure design in modern cities decrease transfer comfort for people, impact greenery due to appearance of desire paths, and thus increase the amount of dust in the air because of open ground. These mistakes can be avoided if optimal path networks are created considering behavioral aspects of pedestrian traffic, which is a challenge. In this article, we introduce Ant Road Planner, a new method of computer simulation for estimation and creation of optimal path networks which not only considers pedestrians’ behavior but also helps minimize the total length of the paths so that the area is used more efficiently. The method, which includes a modeling algorithm and its software implementation with a user-friendly web interface, makes it possible to predict pedestrian networks for new territories with high precision and detect problematic areas in existing networks. The algorithm was successfully tested on real territories and proved its potential as a decision making support system for urban planners.	algorithm;behavioral modeling;computer simulation;usability;user interface	Sergei Kudinov;Egor Smirnov;Gavriil Malyshev;Ivan Khodnenko	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-93701-4_10	distributed computing;behavioral modeling;pedestrian;software;computer science;ant;stigmergy;user interface	ML	-18.805276194657385	-23.257802935653903	76858

Social media such as Twitter and Facebook have rapidly been growing in recent years. However, we do not know whether or not the currently popular social media will remain in the future. A number of studies have been conducted to try to understand the conditions or mechanisms that create and keep social media thriving using a public goods game and/or meta-rewards games, in which situations where many users post articles and respond to them as reactions in social media correspond to situations where cooperation is dominant in these games. However, they assume that agent networks in social media are complete graphs that are known to be dissimilar to actual social networks. We examined the conditions required to keep agent networks thriving based on Watts and Strogatz (WS) and Barabasi-Albert (BA) models, which are more similar to actual social networks. We experimentally found similarities and differences in the conditions for cooperation-dominant situations between networks based on complete graphs and those based on WS and BA models. Our results indicated that it was easier to maintain cooperation-dominant situations in BA-model networks than in other networks.	barabási–albert model;business architecture;experiment;social media;social network;watts humphrey	Yuki Hirahara;Fujio Toriumi;Toshiharu Sugawara	2013	2013 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT)	10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.165	non-cooperative game;game theory;simulation;social media;computer science;artificial intelligence;world wide web;complex network;prisoner's dilemma	AI	-15.772032899260779	-15.733624391696429	77020
2c8b3dadca7509247051db25389b7a62c51a312e	decision-making algorithm for multisensor fusion based on grey relation and ds evidence theory		Decision-making algorithm, as the key technology for uncertain data fusion, is the core to obtain reasonable multisensor information fusion results. DS evidence theory is a typical and widely applicable decision-making method. However, DS evidence theory makes decisions without considering the sensors’ difference, which may lead to illogical results. In this paper, we present a novel decision-making algorithm for uncertain fusion based on grey relation and DS evidence theory. The proposed algorithm comprehensively takes consideration of sensor’s credibility and evidence’s overall discriminability, which can solve the uncertainty problems caused by inconsistence of sensors themselves and complexity of monitoring environment and simultaneously ensure the validity and accuracy of fusion results.The innovative decision-making algorithm firstly obtains the sensor’s credibility through the introduction of grey relation theory and then defines two impact factors as sensor’s credibility and evidence’s overall discriminability according to the focal element analyses and evidence’s distance analysis, respectively; after that, it uses the impact factors to modify the evidences and finally gets more reasonable and effective results through DS combination rule. Simulation results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can overcome the trouble caused by large evidence conflict and one-vote veto, which indicates that it can improve the ability of target judgment and enhance precision of uncertain data fusion.Thus the novel decisionmaking method has a certain application value.

Technical, economic and government regulations are some of the factors that need to be evaluated in or- der to contract subsea services and procurement activities. Pre-studies need to be conducted to design the best subsea concept and to assess the development costs in order to succeed in the project execution and to keep the production rate and profits as expected. There are many factors that should be addressed before selecting the concept. By identifying and studying these aspects, the project management will be able to develop an optimum production system and select the best equipment to cover the functions needed, as well as identify health, safety, environmental and quality requirements and spare parts' availa- bility for maintenance interventions. This will help to achieve the integrity of the installation and to reduce risks. In this paper we identify various aspects, factors and design criteria that need to be addressed in the design phase.

It outlines key concepts, postulated relationships, and a game theoretic methodology (an n -player iterated stag hunt) actualized in an agent-based simulation. Our GEE concept extends the traditional supply chain-based “extended enterprise” concept to accommodate networks of relatively autonomous government organizations that lack the more static supplier-customer relationships seen in supply chains. A GEE is a dynamical system of systems (SoS) pursuing one or more public goals, potentially at a cost to the component organizations' private goals, rendering each decision situation about costly cooperation a social dilemma for the components. Analysis focuses on the level of “belonging,” a Boardman-Sauser “SoS differentiating characteristic” that, in our case, reflects the cooperativeness of GEE components. Preliminary results indicate that the stag hunt is an appropriate game for the case study; taken singly, sympathy is stronger than trust, fear or greed; fear has little impact on its own but dampens other forces; and the higher payoffs earned may justify the risks inherent in cooperation, especially for uncertain agents.	agent-based model;apple sos;autonomy;dynamical system;extended enterprise;game theory;iteration;simulation;software agent;system of systems	Lawrence John;Pat McCormick;Tom McCormick;Gregory R.

248be5b6b67ec336853a1095b75e739d5fc4b192	modeling attitude diffusion and agenda setting: the mama model		Attitude diffusion is where “attitudes” (general, relatively enduring evaluative responses to a topic) spread through a population. Attitudes play an incredibly important role in human decision-making (for instance, in health care decisions) and are a critical part of social psychology. However, existing models of diffusion do not account for key differentiating aspects of attitudes. In this work, we develop the “Multi-Agent, Multi-Attitude” (MAMA) model which incorporates several key factors of attitude diffusion: (1) multiple, interacting attitudes; (2) social influence between individuals; and (3) media influence. All three components have strong support from the social science community. Using the MAMA model, we re-visit the problem of influence maximization in a attitude diffusion setting where media influence is possible—we show that strategic manipulation of the media can lead to statistically significant decreases in diffusion of attitudes. Finally, to better understand the dynamics of the model, we use an absorbing Markov chain to characterize state transitions in the model.	absorbing markov chain;entropy maximization;interaction;population	Kiran Lakkaraju	2016	Social Network Analysis and Mining	10.1007/s13278-016-0322-4	psychology;simulation;communication;social psychology	ML	-15.525860303785443	-15.255460973040767	77957

Rock mass rating (RMR) system has become a reliable and widespread pre-design system for its ease of use and variety in engineering applications such as tunnels, foundations, and slopes. In RMR system, six parameters are employed in classifying a rock mass: uniaxial compressive strength of intact rock material (UCS), rock quality designation (RQD), spacing of discontinuities (SD), condition of discontinuities (CD), condition of groundwater (CG), and orientation of discontinuities (OD). The ratings of the first three parameters UCS, RQD, and SD are determined via graphic readings where the last three parameters CD, CG, and OD are estimated by the tables that are composed of interval valued linguistic expressions. Because of these linguistic expresions, the estimated rating values of the last three become fuzzy especially when the related conditions are close to border of any two classes. In such cases, these fuzzy situations could lead up incorrect rock class estimations. In this study, an empirical database based on the linguistic expressions for CD, CG, and OD is developed for training Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifiers. The results obtained from graphical readings and ANN classifiers are unified in a simulation model (USM). The data obtained from five different tunnels, which were excavated for derivation purpose, are used to evaluate classification results of conventional method and proposed model. Finally, it is noted that more accurate and realistic ratings are reached by means of proposed model.	angular defect;artificial neural network;engineering design process;rough set;simulation;usability	Ertan Mert;Serhat Yilmaz;Melih Inal	2011	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-011-0578-6	usability;classifier;biological classification;rock mass rating;computer science;graphics;artificial intelligence;core recovery parameters;discontinuity;simulation modeling;compressive strength;artificial neural network;models of neural computation;systems design	AI	-11.166912047349	-15.70881364748253	78660

The dynamics that govern the spread o f influence is the following: initially only elements inS are influenced; subsequently at each round, the set of influenced elements is augmented by all nodes in the networ k that have a sufficiently large number of already influenced neighbors. While it is kno w that the general problem is hard to solve — even in the approximate sense — we present ex ac polynomial time algorithms for trees, paths, cycles, and complete graphs. 1 The Motivations Gaming giant FONY © is about to launch its brand new console PlayForFUN-7 R ©, and intends to maximize the adoption of the new product through a massive viral marketing campaign, exploiting the human tendency to conform [4].

Unfortunately, a fundamental condition for effective teams -- familiarity with other members -- stands in contrast to crowd work's flexible, on-demand nature. We enable effective crowd teams with Huddler, a system for workers to assemble familiar teams even under unpredictable availability and strict time constraints. Huddler utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize for highly familiar teammates when individual availability is unknown. We first present a field experiment that demonstrates the value of familiarity for crowd teams: familiar crowd teams doubled the performance of ad-hoc (unfamiliar) teams on a collaborative task. We then report a two-week field deployment wherein Huddler enabled crowd workers to convene highly familiar teams in 18 minutes on average. This research advances the goal of supporting long-term, team-based collaborations without sacrificing the flexibility of crowd work.	algorithm;complex network;crowdsourcing;dynamic programming;hoc (programming language);organizing (structure);software deployment;top-down and bottom-up design	Niloufar Salehi;Andrew McCabe;Melissa A.

6456518468af7b3a23c0d49c5aee4bde2559f590	simulation of intermodal freight transportation systems: a taxonomy		Intermodal transportation refers to multimodal chains or networks involving at least two transportation modes, freight being packed into a “container” and not being handled at intermodal-transfer terminals on its trip from its origin to its destination. This characterization makes intermodal transportation a multiactor complex system involving a broad range of interacting stakeholders, decision makers, operations, and planning activities. Due to this complexity, simulation is much studied and used within the field of operations research, yielding models, methods, and tools to manage transportation activities and support the decision-making processes. The literature includes a large number of contributions on particular issues, but a broad view of the field is still missing. This paper aims to fill this gap, using a new taxonomy to structure the recent relevant literature. The proposed taxonomy thus appears a useful instrument to classify the literature and support further analyzes, identifying main findings, trends, and future paths of intermodal freight transportation systems across several dimensions (e.g., modes, geographical extensions, time horizons, and simulation objectives).	complex system;markov chain;multimodal interaction;operations research;simulation;taxonomy (general)	Teodor Gabriel Crainic;Guido Perboli;Mariangela Rosano	2018	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2017.11.061	management science;operations management;mathematics;complex system	Metrics	-17.35181844272273	-21.6924948090966	79607

In the past, researchers have often turned to geographic information systems (GIS) to model these interactions. Although GIS provide a powerful tool for examining the spatial aspects of these interactions, they are unable to model the dynamic, individual-level interactions across time and space. In an attempt to address these issues, some researchers have begun to use simulation models. But these models rely on artificial landscapes that do not take into account the environment in which humans move and interact. This research presents the methodology for ‘situating’ simulation through the use of a new modeling tool, Agent Analyst, which integrates agent-based modeling (ABM) and GIS. Three versions of a model of street robbery are presented to illustrate the importance of using ‘real’ data to inform agent activity spaces and movement. The successful implementation of this model demonstrates that: (1) agents can move along existing street networks; (2) land use patterns can be used to realistically distribute agent’s homes and activities across a city; and (3) the incidence and pattern of street robberies is significantly different when ‘real’ data are used.	agent-based model;geographic information system;incidence matrix;interaction;simulation	Elizabeth R.

2cb7ddb6b61b3aec47fbd2385ca54eb3916b2c77	research and design of shandong province animal epidemic prevention system based on gis		Animal husbandry has become one of the important pillars of agricultural economy. In the meantime, along with the rapid development of animal husbandry, all kinds of animal disease hazardous to health of livestock and poultry appear, such as High Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) and Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD). Therefore, establishment of animal epidemic prevention system is very necessary. Geographic Information System (GIS) has been widely used both in the field of disease control and prevention and livestock and poultry epidemic prevention for its strong ability of spatial analysis and visualization analysis. Despite all this, provincial livestock and poultry epidemic prevention system based on GIS is rare. To obtain animal epidemic information accurately and timely, and improve the mechanism of animal outbreaks, combing with the reality of Shandong province, an animal epidemic prevention and early warning forecast system is developed. The purpose of the system, the system structure, function module, and development platform are analyzed. Combined with GIS, handheld mobile GIS/GPS, and GPRS/CDMA, the system has proved its flexibility, stability, convenience, and easy extensibility, assuring effective implementation of animal epidemic monitoring.	geographic information system	Jiabo Sun;Wenjie Feng;Xiaoyan Zhang;Luyan Niu;Yanzhong Liu	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-48354-2_59	environmental health;information system;influenza a virus subtype h5n1;livestock;foot-and-mouth disease;outbreak;geographic information system;warning system;environmental science;animal husbandry	EDA	-10.955919272428089	-22.597999645852884	79729

4881b906d401eb5f62566f7a02a19f264fb765a2	a fuzzy fine-kinney-based risk evaluation approach with extended multimoora method based on choquet integral		Abstract The Fine-Kinney as a comprehensive and quantitative risk assessment method has been commonly applied to aid in controlling occupational hazards in practice. However, the Fine-Kinney-based risk evaluation approach suffers from the drawbacks of failing to deal with the interaction relationships between risk parameters and determine the risk priority of occupational hazards. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel Fine-Kinney-based risk evaluation approach combining triangular fuzzy number, MULTIMOORA method and Choquet integral to overcome the limitations in the current Fine-Kinney-based risk evaluation approach. First, the triangular fuzzy number is employed to determine the risk parameters scores in Fine-Kinney approach. Second, the relative preference relation based triangular fuzzy number ranking method is integrated with the Choquet integral to determine importance weights of risk parameters. Third, an extended MULTIMOORA method with Choquet integral is proposed to determine the risk priority order of hazards by considering the interaction relationships between risk parameters. Finally, a case study of ballast tank maintenance is selected to demonstrate the application and feasibility of the proposed hybrid Fine-Kinney-based risk evaluation method, and comparison and sensitivity analysis are also conducted to validate the effectiveness of the new risk assessment model.	nörlund–rice integral	Weizhong Wang;Xinwang Liu;Yong Qin	2018	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2018.08.019	engineering;mathematical optimization;fuzzy logic;preference relation;risk assessment;ranking;choquet integral;fuzzy number	SE	-6.517787766399158	-18.419121023272247	80032

Although generally regarded as a negative influence on reliability, it has not been widely studied. This paper attempts to determine the epistemic effects of conformity by analyzing a mathematical model of this behavior. In addition to investigating the effect of conformity on the reliability of individuals and groups, this paper attempts to determine the optimal structure for conformity. That is, supposing that conformity is inevitable, what is the best way for conformity effects to occur? The paper finds that in some contexts conformity effects are reliability inducing and, more surprisingly even when it is counterproductive, not all methods for reducing its effect are helpful. These conclusions contribute to a larger discussion in social epistemology regarding the effect of social behavior on individual reliability.	conformity;inductive reasoning;mathematical model;social structure	Kevin J.

Initially, ad hoc techniques were incorporated to deal with these problems. At the same time, approximate reasoning technology was developing as a separate field. It is only recently that techniques from these two fields have been combined. EMERGE, a medical expert system developed by the authors, has been modified by replacing the original ad hoc approach to reasoning with uncertainty with techniques from approximate reasoning based on work by Yager. In this paper, a method is presented for obtaining values for evidential weighting factors.	expert system	Donna L. Hudson;Maurice E.

09ba1824aeb5df2e73b44610f57eb526c47fc2b2	a configuration-based recommender system for supporting e-commerce decisions	decision support;e commerce;004 informatik;recommender system;ddc 004;configuration system;attribute weights	Multi-attribute value theory (MAVT)-based recommender systems have been proposed for dealing with issues of existing recommender systems, such as the cold-start problem and changing preferences. However, as we argue in this paper, existing MAVT-based methods for measuring attribute importance weights do not fit the shopping tasks for which recommender systems are typically used. These methods assume well-trained decision makers who are willing to invest time and cognitive effort, and who are familiar with the attributes describing the available alternatives and the ranges of these attribute levels. Yet, recommender systems are most often used by consumers who are usually not familiar with the available attributes and ranges and who wish to save time and effort. Against this background, we develop a new method, based on a product configuration process, which is tailored to the characteristics of these particular decision makers. We empirically compare our method to SWING, ranking-based conjoint analysis and TRADEOFF in a betweensubjects laboratory experiment with 153 participants. Results indicate that our proposed method performs better than TRADEOFF and CONJOINT and at least as well as SWING in terms of recommendation accuracy, better than SWING and TRADEOFF and at least as well as CONJOINT in terms of cognitive load, and that participants were faster with our method than with any other method. We conclude that our method is a promising option to help support consumers’ decision processes in e-commerce shopping tasks.	cold start;e-commerce;knowledge-based configuration;recommender system;swing (java)	Michael Scholz;Verena Dorner;Guido Schryen;Alexander Benlian	2017	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2016.09.057	decision support system;computer science;marketing;data mining;database;recommender system	AI	-6.207620026064901	-14.118316220674902	80718
2bb791e2e04a37fda6caef47d95626e85309aaaf	insights into bootstrap percolation: its equivalence with k-core percolation and the giant component		K-core and bootstrap percolation are widely studied models that have been used to represent and understand diverse deactivation and activation processes in natural and social systems. Since these models are considerably similar, it has been suggested in recent years that they could be complementary, however, this statement has not yet been proven mathematically. In this manuscript we provide a rigorous analysis that shows that the heterogeneous bootstrap percolation is the complement of the heterogeneous k-core percolation in complex networks. On the other hand, a problem that has been addressed in bootstrap percolation is the theoretical estimation of the relative size of the active nodes belonging to the giant component, P∞,b. However, we perform several stochastic simulations and find that they do not totally match these theoretical estimations. Here we present equations that describe accurately the fraction of nodes belonging to the giant component in the process of bootstrap percolation. We show that when using the branching theory to compute the size of the giant component, we must consider two different types of links, which are related to distinct spanning branches of active nodes. We show that our simulations exhibit a great agreement with our theoretical approach. ∗ mdimuro@mdp.edu.ar	bootstrap percolation;complex network;degeneracy (graph theory);depth perception;file spanning;giant component;simulation;social system;turing completeness	M.

Many empirical studies have been presented about the evaluation of manufacturing system's performance. However, the performance evaluation is quite subjective, since it relies on the individual judgment of the managers who have different, various and multi-factor assessment methods of a system's performance. In this study, two fuzzy modeling designs were developed and in the construction of the models, a hierarchy process was used. In the first method, the performance factors and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) were fuzzified and the use of fuzzy numbers and a fuzzy AHP for this problem was recommended. Also, the relative importance of these factors with respect to each other and their contribution to the overall performance was quantified with fuzzy linguistic terms. In the other method, we proposed Approximate Reasoning (AR) based on experts' knowledge which is represented with the collection of the rules. These fuzzy rule bases are ''if-then'' linguistic rules that are formed with linguistic variables such as poor, below average, average, above average and superior. Additionally, the problem was structured with the normal AHP and System-With-Feedback (SWF), Finally, these methods were compared. The results showed that fuzzy AHP leads to the best result. It is expected that the recommended models would have an advantage in the competitive manufacturing including cost, flexibility, quality, speed and dependability.		Adem Göleç;Harun Taskin	2007	Inf.

The proposed approach extends the formalization of multicriteria methods and social network analysis in Geographical Information Systems (GIS), including spatial structure and temporal dynamics. The combined application can be useful in spatial decision making process for urban planning, supporting and modelling operations for urban land-use change.

Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) architecture is one of the examples in this group problem solving space, having demonstrated successful applications for well-defined domains such as military planning and trading auctions. Recent work in crowd sourcing applications based on enterprise social networks (e.g. People Cloud) showed that the group problem solving approach can be extended to enterprise and potentially Internet-wide scales. However, systems operating at such scales assume that candidate group participants make decisions about which groups to join based on limited connectivity and local information. This paper focuses on the relationship between network adaptation for candidate group participants and performance of problem solving groups. We demonstrate that systems that expect to form groups (e.g. crowd sourcing) by engaging participants equipped with diverse skill sets require more sophisticated network adaptation strategies than what can be expected based on previous research. To address this need, we evaluate a set of network adaptation algorithms for crowd sourcing and present some empirical results from a simulation based study.	algorithm;attachments;crowdsourcing;enterprise social networking;human-based computation;image scaling;multi-agent system;problem solving;simulation;social network	Kirill Osipov;Gita Reese Sukthankar	2012	2012 International Conference on Social Informatics	10.1109/SocialInformatics.2012.55	social science;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;data mining;management science;management;world wide web;crowdsourcing;social network	AI	-14.8642615981144	-10.478591602585249	80853

This paper introduces a new approach that combines topological relationships between regions in 2-dimensional space with temporal relationships between convex intervals in time. Resulting relationships are defined and visually presented within a 3-dimensional space that integrates the geographical space as a 2-dimensional space and the time line as the third dimension. Conceptual neighbourhoods are identified and extended by the concept of semi-transitions and transitions. Such a flexible framework presents the advantage of being derived from accepted relationships in both space and time. Its computational implementation is therefore compatible with current spatial and temporal GIS models.	geographic information system;requirement;semiconductor industry;timeline	Christophe Claramunt;Bin Jiang	2001	Journal of Geographical Systems	10.1007/s101090100066	three-dimensional space;two-dimensional space;pollution;geography;space;mathematics;geometry;geographic information system;cartography	DB	-15.872567012563296	-19.23970346471527	81295

In this study, we establish a tie between Z-number concept and type-I and type-II quantified sentences in order to calculate the truth degree of a linguistic summary covering possibilistic and probabilistic information.

Extensive resources are directed at combating cholera yet it remains a significant problem. Limited resources could better be directed to prevent outbreaks if it were possible to assess the risk of an outbreak in space and time. The CSIR in South Africa is investigating technologies to predict health risk in line with national priorities. This paper describes an early warning GIS prototype tool aimed at identifying favourable preconditions for cholera outbreaks. These preconditions were defined using an expert system approach. The variables thus identified were input into a spatial fuzzy logic model that outputs risks. The model is based on the assumption that endemic reservoirs of cholera occur and that environmental conditions, especially algal blooms, trigger Vibrio growth in the natural environment. If the preconditions are met, the subsequent spread of cholera depends mainly on socio-economic factors such as human behaviour and access to safe water supply and sanitation. This paper focuses on the environmental preconditions. The methodology described relies on capturing expert knowledge and historic data that integrate climatic and biophysical parameters with epidemiological data to produce a fuzzy surface of cholera outbreak risk potential. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This was accomplished by simulating the players in a memetic framework. Our primary motivation involves solving the tragedy of the commons problem, a dilemma in which individuals acting selfishly destroy the shared resources of the population. In solving this problem, we identify strategies for applying coalition formation to the spatial distribution of cooperative or defective agents. We use two reinforcement learning methods, temporal difference learning and Q-learning, on the agents in the environment. This overcomes the negative impact of random selection without cooperation between neighbors. Agents of the memetic framework form coalitions in which the leaders make the decisions as a way of improving performance. By imposing a reward and cost schema to the multiagent system, we are able to measure the performance of the individual leader as well as the performance of the organization.	agent-based model;algorithm;approximation;experiment;heuristic (computer science);iterative method;memetics;multi-agent system;prisoner's dilemma;q-learning;qualitative comparative analysis;reinforcement learning;reputation system;simulation;temporal difference learning	Udara Weerakoon	2015		10.5220/0005199000220031	game theory;memetics;simulation;artificial intelligence;management science	ML	-16.357682006919614	-11.95834465826841	81869

However, there is an unfortunate impression that simulation is just a complicated exercise in computer programming. Consequently, many “studies” have been composed of heuristic model building, coding, and a single run of the program to produce the “answers.” This attitude, which neglects the important issues of how to build a valid model and how to draw correct statistical inferences from a properly coded model, has led to erroneous conclusions being drawn from many simulation studies.

This system includes subsystems of cognitive and game-theoretic analysis, geoinformation and hydrodynamic simulations. The paper presents the cognitive graph, two-level and three-level models of hierarchical games for the cases of uncontrolled and controlled development of the problem situation. We described the quantitative analysis of the effects of different strategies for the spatial distribution of the urbanized territories. For this reason we conducted the territory zoning according to the level of negative consequences of urbanization for various agents. In addition, we found an analytical solution for games with the linear dependence of the average flooded area on the urbanized area. We numerically computed a game equilibrium for dependences derived from the imitational geoinformation and hydrodynamic modeling of flooding. As the result, we showed that the transition to the three-level management system and the implementation of an optimal urbanization strategy minimize its negative consequences.	clinical decision support system;computer simulation;denial-of-service attack;game theory;geographic information system;numerical analysis;uncontrolled format string	Alexander A.

It occurs in a complex setting of criminals, victims, police and society, and its framework is set up by legal norms as well as informal norms of the actor groups involved. The paper presents two agent-based simulation models which differ with respect to the decision making mode, which is either stochastical with fixed probabilities or deliberative where decisions depend on utility considerations and norms learned during the process. The central research questions of the paper — beside the question how extortion racket system can be appropriately modeled — concern the divergence of the results of the two model versions, the comparison of the input parameter combinations, the motivations of input parameters and the validation of the results by comparing them to available empirical data.	agent-based model;racket;simulation	Klaus G.

The system extends our previous work in developing negotiation support systems Family_Winner and AssetDivider. In this environment one agent uses a Bayesian Belief Network expertly modeled with knowledge of the Australian Family Law domain to advise disputants of their Best Alternatives to Negotiated Agreements via a percentage property split. Another agent incorporates this percentage split into an integrative bargaining process and applies heuristics and game theory to equitably distribute marital property assets and facilitate further trade-offs. The purpose of the system is to add greater fairness to family property law negotiations.

1f12bcf2e4f317feaf7811803452a82205dddbe8	passenger flow simulation in a hub airport: an application to the barcelona international airport	agent based simulation abs;airport micro simulation;specification and description language sdl;barcelona airport;article	This paper describes a conceptual model intended to be applied in a general approach to the micro-simulation of hub airports terminals. The proposed methodology is illustrated with the development of a simulation model originally intended to help in the design of the new terminal at Barcelona International Airport. This model represents in detail, among many other elements, passengers’ flows in the different areas of these complex facilities. Agent-based simulation techniques were included to represent the different actors’ behaviors, and a formal representation of the model using Specification and Description Language (SDL) was used to represent the complexity of all the system elements. To pre-process a diverse and considerable amount of raw data provided by airport designers and other sources to feed the simulation environment Flight Planner Manager was developed as a toolkit to parameterize the different model factors and to generate required specific input data. This project was conducted over 3 years leading to the development of a system not only conceived to assess in the airport initial design process but also to constitute a recurrent decision taking instrument to dynamically optimize terminal management and operations. 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 1. Objectives and methodology The different and asynchronous flows merging in the terminal areas represent a considerable challenge for modern airport management, even considering the well-known or easily predictable passengers’ behaviors in this specific and regulated context. Many rules are linked to arrivals and departures patterns, workers routines, schedules and conditions, as long with specific airport operations and activities (check-in, access control, shopping or food and beverages areas distribution and characterization, waiting spaces. . .). Airport managers emphasizes the importance of aspects like security, efficiency, bottleneck avoidance, quality of services, comfort, ease of use or sustainability and rationalization of costs, among many others. A large amount of questions need to be solved ranging from the assignment of arriving flights to available gates [3], to problems related with recurrent or unexpected delays, access control dimensioning and reconfiguration, or the importance of public transportation systems scheduling [16,19]. This paper is focused on the modeling of space requirements and flow management in the main terminal building and related areas of a hub airport. The objectives to cover with the required simulation based decision tool are necessarily P. Fonseca i Casas et al. / Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory 44 (2014) 78–94 79 multiple: (i) to assess the design and construction of a new airport terminal taking in account economic and social forecasting and other strategic considerations (this issue comprehends spaces, flows and resources and facilities involved in a complex and costly construction process); (ii) to produce and validate a decision tool as a basis to evaluate operational alternative scenarios under a dynamic management. The work is organized as follows: in this first section the objectives and the methodology are introduced while in Section 2 we detail how the different flows are considered. In Section 3 we describe the model globally representing the airport and in Section 3.2 results obtained from experimentation with the implemented model are shown. Finally in Section 4, some concluding remarks are noted and further improvements and other work are suggested. Space requirements are a key factor in airport management [8,13,23]. Models dealing with space requirements are frequently based on differential equations or queuing theory [14,15]. These approximations are not however sufficient to provide a detailed characterization of several complex flow patterns. Additionally an airport is really a complex system and to understand all the flows and their behavior requires a multidisciplinary approach to achieve their characterization. These internal and external assessors need tools to evaluate and sustain their specific proposals by means of objective and understandable tools and protocols. This is of course common to other complex systems and a considerable amount of knowledge and expertise has been already developed. Nevertheless, infrastructures of the dimensions and costs considered in this project represent a considerable effort in terms of tools’ conceptualization, developments, testing, results validity, credibility and usability along the whole engineering process. These complex issues must be simultaneously envisaged in order to give an adequate answer to the project planned objectives. Main challenges we face are to obtain an accurate and valid information of the system, to build a complete and unambiguous model from this information and to generate results in a time span adequate to the project strategic requirements (infrastructure definition), and to the operational requirements (the daily use of the tool). As we will detail in Section 3 at least six different teams’ categories of specialists should be involved (see Table 1 for the teams’ definition in Barcelona project). Airport authorities’ involvement under a concurrent and collaborative schema propitiates that the final model reasonably meets their expectations. This commitment contributes effectively to resulting model validity and accreditation. It definitively facilitates the acceptation and implementation of specific solutions selected among a set of proposed scenarios for the new facility. The validation schema we followed was Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) [22]. Particularly Barcelona Airport project validation was conducted by external assessors concurrently with the design and development of the simulation model phases. Final validation and accreditation involved not only this team but also other experts and airport authorities. These teams frequently use different tools and languages. A principal challenge is to collect this knowledge and to embody it in a commonly accepted model framework. To coordinate the project development it was necessary to establish a formal language to simplify and facilitate communication and interactions transversally among teams’ members. Formal languages that can be used for this purpose include Petri Nets [4] and Forrester diagrams [24]. In our formulation we use Specification and Description Language (SDL) for the model definition. We also selected a visual simulation environment, Witness [11,12], to facilitate the discussion and the understandability of the different constitutive blocks of the model and for the implementation of some of the main simulated processes. SDL is a formal object-oriented language defined by the International Telecommunication Union – Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU–T) as Recommendation Z.100 [10]. This language is designed to specify complex, event-driven, real-time, interactive applications involving many concurrent activities, using discrete signals to enable communication [5,10]. SDL is a powerful and modern language widely used in different areas -not only in simulationand can be easily combined with UML. Model definition is supported by different types of components: Structure: system, blocks, processes and processes hierarchy. Behavior: defined through the different processes. Data: based on abstract data types (ADT).

We have explored predominant sociological and cultural traits. We offer a methodology for parametrically adjusting relevant traits. This exploratory study heralds a capability to deliberately tune cultural group traits in order to produce a desired group behavior. To validate our methodology, we implemented a prototypical-agent-based simulated test bed for demonstrating an exemplar from intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance scenario. A group of simulated agents traverses a hostile territory while a user adjusts their cultural group trait settings. Group and individual utilities are dynamically observed against parametric values for the selected traits. Uncertainty avoidance index and individualism are the cultural traits we examined in depth. Upon the user's training of the correspondence between cultural values and system utilities, users deliberately produce the desired system utilities by issuing changes to trait. Specific cultural traits are without meaning outside of their context. Efficacy and timely application of traits in a given context do yield desirable results. This paper heralds a path for the control of large systems via parametric cultural adjustments.	agent-based model;eaf2 gene;testbed;trait;value (ethics)	Gaurav Tuli;Henry Hexmoor	2010	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)	10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2036592	command and control;intelligence;simulation;cognition;uncertainty;uncertainty avoidance;computer science;control system;artificial intelligence;machine learning;multi-agent system;supervisory control;statistics	HCI	-18.483834454199418	-14.700091504806489	82484

In spite of many reported studies, little is known about what influences their migration. We approach this subject by using an ecosystem model consisting of artificial agents and five areas. We simulate under the environmental condition that the average annual temperature rises every year, which is modeled on the current global temperature rise. Our agents emerge the migration behavior similar to the multi-generational migration of the actual Monarch. The migration process of the agents is discussed.	bbn butterfly;ecosystem model;emergence;intelligent agent;simulation	Katsuya Suetsugu;Atsuko Mutoh;Shohei Kato;Hidenori Itoh	2012			simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;adaptive behavior;artificial life	Metrics	-16.267365850445348	-21.57665088982118	82807

The model we consider accounts for population decomposition and interaction in industrial districts. The approach we follow is twofold: on one hand, we implement progressively more complex models using different approaches (vertical multiple implementations); on the other hand, we replicate the agent-based simulation with different implementations using jESOF, JAS and plain C++ (horizontal multiple implementations). By using both different implementation approaches and a multiple implementation strategy, we highlight the benefits that arise when the same model is implemented on radically different simulation environments, comparing the advantages of multiple modeling implementations. Our findings provide some important suggestions in terms of model validation, showing how models of complex systems tend to be extremely sensitive to implementation details. Finally we point out how statistical techniques may be necessary when comparing different platform implementations of a single model.	agent-based model;agent-based social simulation;c++;complex systems;java analysis studio;self-replicating machine	Ugo Merlone;Michele Sonnessa;Pietro Terna	2008	J.

This paper presents an enhanced evolutionary model, presented earlier, for the design of demand responsive routes and transport networks. The approach adopts the survival of the fittest principle from competitive developing world paratransit systems with respect to vehicles, market actor characteristics, route patterns and route functions. The model is integrated into a microscopic multi-agent simulation framework, and successfully applied to a naive and a complex scenario. The scenarios include the interaction of paratransit services with conventional public transport. With limited resources paratransit services compete and cooperate with each other to find sustainable routes, which compete or complement existing public transport lines. Besides providing a starting point for paratransit modeling of a region, the approach can also be used to identify areas with insu cient supply of public transport.

de0ffaa431ae756b992b8e9da5bb9b739c6727ac	resolving difference score issues in information systems research	is servqual;information systems research;polynomial regression analysis;indirect measures;difference scores	A number of models and theories in information systems research include concepts of a match between two variables or states. The development of measures for this concept can present problems, because decisions must be made about the nature of the comparison. Should indirect measures of the match be employed, then methodological issues arise about how to best handle the measure when testing the model. Difference scores are commonly used to measure a match between variables or states in IS research, but these have implicit assumptions about the theory and data characteristics that are often false. Not unexpectedly, false assumptions can lead to erroneous conclusions about the relationships among the variables that are used to determine a match in a research model. The implicit assumptions restrict the form of the relationships and limit the IS researcher's ability to understand the possible interplay among theoretical concepts. We suggest some guidelines for the formation and testing of models that measure the match. In addition, we recommend polynomial regression analysis as one means of analyzing the more complex relationships in IS studies. We then use an IS service quality example to illustrate the issues involved in the use of matching variables and make suggestions with regard to using or avoiding difference scores.	information systems research	Gary Klein;James J.

A doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2011.11.026 ⇑ Corresponding author. Tel.: +385 1 2383267; fax: E-mail address: josip.mikulic@efzg.hr (J. Mikulić). Importance–performance analysis (IPA) is a decision-support tool used in prioritizing quality improvements of products/services. Recently, back-propagation neural network (BPNN)-based approaches have been proposed to deal with the problem of asymmetric effects in customer satisfaction formation. Though reliability of IPA is increased by the integration of BPNN, shortcomings of the analytical framework remain that (a) it does not provide insight into forms and degrees of these asymmetric effects, (b) it does not account for differences between the relevance and determinance of quality attributes, and (c) it neglects the competitor dimension in attribute-prioritization. Since all these issues have important managerial implications, the authors of this study propose an extended BPNN-based IPA that uses a multidimensional operationalization of attribute-importance, and that considers competitive performance levels. Using data from an airline satisfaction survey, an empirical test reveals that the proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional BPNN-based IPA. In particular, conventional BPNN-IPA would mislead managerial action with regard to 3 out of 8 quality components (37.5%). 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

These indicators are important for the point that agents need to accomplish a task. However they are inadequate  to make clear the entity of phenomena that occur in complex system, because they are specialized in the target system and  the analysis is also specialized. In these respects the approaches that analyze a system quantitatively are begun to investigate  in recent years. In our research, we propose the approach that analyzes a multiagent system quantitatively by focusing on  the dynamics of a system and interaction among multiagents. We use two indicators, i.e., entropy and mutual information, for  analyzing a system. Entropy estimates the behavior of an agent and mutual information estimates interactions between two agents.  For verifying these propositions, we conduct verification experiment in the simple slime mold model. The result shows a relationship  between agents’ behavioral patterns and two indicators, therefore our approach using entropy and mutual information is available  for analyzing a multiagent system.  	mutual information;slime	Koji Nishikawa;Hidenori Kawamura;Azuma Ohuchi	2005		10.1007/3-540-32391-0_39	simulation;geography;artificial intelligence;communication	ML	-17.705218696283964	-15.78147443366343	83392

We have incorporated trading of resources that are critical to the survival of predator agents in a spatial predator-prey animat simulation model. We find that predator agents adapt to trade with one another in the face of extinction and that this leads to successful and stable dynamic equilibria between predators and prey. The spatial mixing properties of agents in our model system shift as a result of the trading patterns. We discuss these emergent phenomena and how they relate to microscopic model parameters and speculate as to how these ideas might be generalised to model trading patterns and markets.	animat;dynamical system;emergence;intelligent agent;lotka–volterra equations;prey;simulation	Chris Scogings;Kenneth A.

The classification was carried out using object-based image analysis (OBIA) to create land cover maps. The classified images were used to predict the land cover changes and urban growth for 2024 and 2034. The simulation model integrated the Markov chain (MC) and Cellular Automata (CA) modelling methods and the simulated maps were compared and validated to the reference maps. The simulation results indicated high accuracy of the MC–CA integrated models. The total agreement between the simulated and the reference maps was >92% for all the simulation years. The results indicated that all five cities showed a massive urban growth between 1985 and 2014 and the predicted results showed that urban expansion is likely to continue going for 2024 and 2034 periods. The transition probabilities of land cover, such as vegetation and water, are most likely to be urban areas, first through conversion to bare soil and then to urban land use. Integrating of time-series satellite images and the MC–CA models provides a better understanding of the past, current and future patterns of land cover changes and urban growth in this region. Simulation of urban growth will help planners to develop sustainable expansion policies that may reduce the future environmental impacts.	cellular automaton;image analysis;map;markov chain;object-based language;simulation;time series	Abdullah F.

To address the corresponding challenges, we employ a Dempster-Shafer (DS) belief theoretic agent model to explore opinion dynamics under bounded confidence. The proposed model further captures the notions of global affinity and the nature of persuasion of agents in social judgement theory. The paper develops several new results and these results regarding formation of clusters and consensus of agent opinions are verified with the aid of several numerical studies accompanied by bifurcation diagrams.	affinity analysis;bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;consensus (computer science);numerical analysis;social network	Ranga Dabarera;Rafael C.

64bd45aba1ba77254935d4ddaf4252c0a43df0ff	approaches to learning to control dynamic uncertainty	journal article;computational modeling;exploration;dynamic	In dynamic environments, when faced with a choice of which learning strategy to adopt, do people choose to mostly explore (maximizing their long term gains) or exploit (maximizing their short term gains)? More to the point, how does this choice of learning strategy influence one’s later ability to control the environment? In the present study, we explore whether people’s self-reported learning strategies and levels of arousal (i.e., surprise, stress) correspond to performance measures of controlling a Highly Uncertain or Moderately Uncertain dynamic environment. Generally, self-reports suggest a preference for exploring the environment to begin with. After which, those in the Highly Uncertain environment generally indicated they exploited more than those in the Moderately Uncertain environment; this difference did not impact on performance on later tests of people’s ability to control the dynamic environment. Levels of arousal were also differentially associated with the uncertainty of the environment. Going beyond behavioral data, our model of dynamic decision-making revealed that, in actual fact, there was no difference in exploitation levels between those in the highly uncertain or moderately uncertain environments, but there were differences based on sensitivity to negative reinforcement. We consider the implications of our findings with respect to learning and strategic approaches to controlling dynamic uncertainty.	causal filter;computation;control theory;exploit (computer security);instability;knowledge acquisition	Magda Osman;Brian D.

In developing these simulations, it is often required tomake decisions about how to represent features in the environment and how events unfold in time. These spatial and temporal choices have been shown to significantly alter model outcomes, yet their interaction is less well understood. In this paper, we make use of a simple group foragingmodel and systematically vary how features are represented (cell size of the landscape) as well as how events unfold in time (order in which foragers take action) to better understand their interaction. Our results show similar nonlinear responses to changes in spatial representation found in the literature, and an effect of the order in which agents were processed. There was also a clear interaction between how features are represented and how events unfold in time, where, under certain environmental representations results were found to be more sensitive to the order in which individuals were processed. Furthermore, the effects of feature representation, scheduling of agents, and their interaction were all found to be influenced by the heterogeneity of the spatial surface (food), suggesting that the statistical properties of the underlying spatial variable will additionally play a role. We suggest that navigating these interactions can be facilitated through a better understanding of how these choices affect the decision landscape(s) on which agents operate. Specifically, how changes to representation affect aggregation and resolution of the decision surface, and thereby the degree to which agents interact directly or indirectly. We suggest that the challenges of dealing with spatial representation, scheduling, and their interaction, while building models could also present an opportunity. As explicitly including alternate representations and scheduling choices during model selection can aid in identifying optimal agent–environment representations. Potentially leading to improved insights into the relationships between spatial processes and the environments in which they occur.

Since the existing emotion models take little account of the influence of spontaneous emotional transition, the importance of social status and the diversity of emotional expressive pattern, IEDS is developed to discuss the emotional changes without receiving external stimuli, setting different emotion-selection rules according to occupations of agents and expressing emotions in vivid way based on fuzzy theory. A real-time communicative interface is represented and the experimental result proves IEDS works well in implementing believable, adaptive and vivid human-agent interaction.	decision support system;expert system;fuzzy logic;human–computer interaction;real-time locating system;selection rule;spontaneous order	Xia Mao;Haiyan Bao;Zhijun Li	2008	2008 Eighth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications	10.1109/ISDA.2008.56	computer science;artificial intelligence;autonomous agent;multi-agent system	Robotics	-18.55674655376391	-12.722043091668631	84386

This paper proposes a new risk assessment approach able to manage risk in the context of integrated management system IMS-QSE while taking into account the uncertainty characterizing the whole process. The proposed approach is mainly based on fuzzy set theory and Monte Carlo simulation to provide an appropriate risk estimation values and adequate decisions regarding the three management systems Quality, Security and Environment. In order to show the effectiveness of our approach, we have performed simulations on real database in the petroleum field at TOTAL TUNISIA company.	information management system (ims);risk assessment	Marwa Ben Aissia;Ahmed Badreddine;Nahla Ben Amor	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-19066-2_1	risk assessment;uncertainty;management science;fuzzy set;monte carlo method	HCI	-9.421461359094183	-18.06400935999831	84430
9a2879057b59ea204253f8c7dcfc60f1e6520a64	sis epidemic spreading with heterogeneous infection rates		In this work, we aim to understand the influence of the heterogeneity of infection rates on the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic spreading. Employing the classic SIS model as the benchmark, we study the influence of the independently identically distributed infection rates on the average fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state. The log-normal, gamma and a newly designed distributions are considered for infection rates. We find that, when the recovery rate is small, i.e., the epidemic spreads out in both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases: 1) the heterogeneity of infection rates on average retards the virus spreading, and 2) a larger even-order moment of the infection rates leads to a smaller average fraction of infected nodes, but the odd-order moments contribute in the opposite way; when the recovery rate is large, i.e., the epidemic may die out or infect a small fraction of the population, the heterogeneity of infection rates may enhance the probability that the epidemic spreads out. Finally, we verify our conclusions via real-world networks with their heterogeneous infection rates. Our results suggest that, in reality the epidemic spread may not be so severe as the classic SIS model indicates, but to eliminate the epidemic is probably more difficult.	benchmark (computing)	Bo Qu;Huijuan Wang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering	10.1109/TNSE.2017.2709786	telecommunications	Web+IR	-13.809943857913577	-17.04293530410993	84478

To understand these challenges, we propose it is necessary to move beyond considering each utility system as a distinct silo. In this paper, a conversion points approach is developed to characterize multiutility systems at any scale and for any specific or theoretical location. The story is told of the development of a conversion points approach and its application is examined using an agent-based model. Transport, energy, water, waste, and telecommunications systems are governed and run independently but in practice are highly interdependent. A way to represent all utility systems in an integrated way is described and the benefits of this representation are applied to UK household consumers. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

1203be08be7fdb5d58e1207bb9e427d76549a686	a simulation model to assist in managing the hiv epidemic: imap2	simulation model	The Interactive Model for AIDS Prediction (IMAP2) is a large simulation program for predicting the spread of HIV in the United States and for testing the effects on that spread of various perturbations to the model inputs. IMAP2 is constructed on a transmission-based epidemiological model for the sexual transmission of HIV and a dynamic population model for transmission of HIV by intravenous (injecting) drug abuse. The intent of IMAP2 is to facilitate comparative case studies, rather than absolute predictions for the future course of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and in its intended role it is proving useful.Perturbations to the input data might represent influences of government social policies, improved information gathering, etc., and make the model a vehicle for testing hypotheses. Example hypotheses include: (1) practices which might change the latency period of the disease; and (2) managed patterns of use and efficacy of male and female condoms.We begin by describing the algorithmic core of the model.

The method is a qualitative upgrade of probabilistic safety assessment, using its results in the form of risk-significant components identified through a logical model. The identification of latent weaknesses is made during meetings of the relevant staff who have authority to influence the status of these components. The groups of key organisational factors influencing the component status are identified and it is judged how well they are implemented. In the same way weak points of the management system and latent weaknesses are also taken into account. The method was applied on four occasions. It proved to be efficient, fast and user-friendly, if the organisation of the analysis is correctly implemented, and taking into account the reluctance of some participants to put their knowledge at the disposal of a group understanding of complex technological system.	complex systems;usability	Mitja Kozuh;Janez Peklenik	1999	Cognition, Technology & Work	10.1007/s101110050018	reliability engineering;medicine;environmental health;engineering;suicide prevention;human factors and ergonomics;injury prevention;management system;forensic engineering;computer security;mechanical engineering	SE	-11.07097051204707	-15.96833616205868	84750

This decision is simply taken by looking at the working behaviors of the other agents, comparing the respective levels of well-being and imitating the more advantageous decision of others. The analysis reveals that such mechanism of social learning and imitation suffices to replicate the existing empirical evidence regarding the decline in labor market participation of older people. As a consequence, the paper demonstrates that it is not necessary to assume perfect and unrealistic rationality at the individual level to reproduce a rational behavior in the aggregate.	agent-based model;aggregate data;computation;computational model;rationality;self-replication	Alessandro Moro;Paolo Pellizzari	2017	Knowledge and Information Systems	10.1007/s10115-017-1096-3	social learning;actuarial science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;replicate;computer science;rationality;bounded rationality;imitation;microeconomics;empirical evidence;population	AI	-13.5017555386049	-12.345167645025848	85062

In the first phase, a type-1 fuzzy set (T1FS) model of an individual’s perception of the terms used in rating user satisfaction is derived through a decomposition-based procedure. The analysis is carried out by using well-established metrics and results from the Social Sciences context. In the second phase, interval T2FS models of online user satisfaction are calculated using a similaritybased data mining procedure. The procedure selects an essential and informative subset of the initial T1FSs that is used to discard the outliers automatically. Resulting interval T2FSs, which are synthesized based on the selected subset of T1FSs only, exhibit reasonable shapes and interpretability. Communicated by V. Piuri. M. Moharrer · H. Tahayori · A.

It integrates fuzzy logic principles and unitary structure-based supply chain model and enables addressing uncertainties associated with key inputs of on-time delivery performance for effective decision making process. The proposed pragmatic model deals with the fuzziness of the key inputs including, variations in demand forecasting, materials shortages and distribution lead time, and combines a fuzzy reasoning approach for monitoring on-time delivery of finished products. In systematically dealing with the uncertainties of complex supply chains, this model supports the minimizing of business losses that result from penalties and customer dissatisfaction, and the consequent reduced market share. Application of the proposed model is illustrated using a textile industry case study.	decision support system	Dilupa Nakandala;Premaratne Samaranayake;Henry C. W.

Furthermore, companies have realized that agility is essential for their survival and competitiveness. Consequently, there is no generally accepted method by researchers and practitioners for designing, operating and evaluating agile supply chains. Moreover, the ability to build agile supply chain has developed more slowly than anticipated, because technology for managing agile supply chain is still being developed. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a new approach based on Fuzzy Association Rule Mining to support the decision makers by enhancing the flexibility in making decisions for evaluating agility with both tangibles and intangibles attributes/criteria such as Flexibility, Profitability, Quality, Innovativeness, Pro-activity, Speed of response, Cost and Robustness. Also, by checking the fuzzy classification rules, the goal of knowledge acquisition can be achieved in a framework in which evaluation of agility could be established without constraints, and consequently checked and compared in several details. Efficacy and intricacy of the proposed approach for finding fuzzy association rules from the database for evaluating agility is demonstrated with the help of a numerical example.	fuzzy concept	Vipul Jain;Lyès Benyoucef;S.

Environmental problems include eutrophication of rivers and storages, elevated salinity levels, widespread blooms of toxic blue–green algae, decline of native fish and bird populations, and reduction of area of riverine wetlands. Both the community and the government are committed to improving the state of the environment in the Basin, both for it’s intrinsic ecological values, and to ensure the sustainability of production in what is Australia’s most economically important agricultural region. To facilitate the on-going trade-off process between competing users of this resource, a decision support system (DSS) is being developed which will enable explicit prediction of the likely response of key features of the riverine environment to proposed flow management scenarios. The DSS is being developed using the RAISON shell (Lam, D.C.L., Mayfield, C.I., Swayne, D.A., Hopkins, K., 1994. A prototype information system for watershed management and planning. Journal of Biological Systems 2 (4), 499–517), and will integrate a range of simple models of riverine ecology which are being developed. These models will include qualitative and quantitative models representing the response of different aspects of the instream and floodplain ecology dependent upon the river flow regime. The DSS will not include a detailed model of river hydrology or hydraulics, but rather, will use the output from the range of such models currently in use in the Basin as inputs to the ecological models. The DSS will also provide a range of tools to allow user-defined evaluation of scenario results, as well as explanations and supporting information to elucidate the ecological modelling.  2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Modelers can establish correspondence by providing empirical evidence of real-world behavior that their models skillfully simulate. Since real-world behavior-especially in environmental systems-is often complex, credibly modeling underlying dynamics is essential. We present a pre-modeling diagnostic framework based on Nonlinear Time Series (NLTS) methods for reconstructing real-world environmental dynamics from observed data. The framework is illustrated with a case study of saltwater intrusion into coastal wetlands in Everglades National Park, Florida, USA. We propose that environmental modelers test for systematic dynamic behavior in observed data before resorting to conventional stochastic exploratory approaches unable to detect this valuable information. Reconstructed data dynamics can be used, along with other expert information, as a rigorous benchmark to guide specification and testing of environmental decision-support models corresponding with real-world behavior.

02786c07a2a0d8ab28c3e3039826ba38c8f9b451	on the probabilistic transmission of continuous cultural traits		This paper proposes a framework that generalizes the discrete cultural transmission model of Bisin and Verdier (2001) to a continuous trait setting. We define the cultural distance between two agents as the distance of their traits in the trait space, and model an agent’s cultural intolerance towards another agent as an increasing function of their cultural distance. This captures people’s general tendencies of evaluating culturally more distant people with stronger biases. The resulting cultural evolutionary dynamic can be viewed as a continuous imitative dynamic (as studied in Cheung (2016)) in a population game in which a player’s payoff is equal to the aggregate cultural intolerance he has towards other agents. We use cultural intolerance to define cultural substitutability in the continuous trait setting. We find that as in Bisin and Verdier (2001), cultural substitutability is the key to cultural heterogeneity. Furthermore, the curvature of the cultural intolerance function plays an important role in determining the longrun cultural phenomena. In particular, when the cultural intolerance function is convex, only the most extremely polarized state is a stable limit point.	aggregate data;longrun	Man-Wah Cheung;Jiabin Wu	2018	J.

1db15d3faa3476760f38420a654c825950f690c9	opinion influence and evolution in social networks: a markovian agents model		In this paper, the effect on collective opinions of filtering algorithms managed by social network platforms is modeled and investigated. A stochastic multi-agent model for opinion dynamics is proposed, that accounts for a centralized tuning of the strength of interaction between individuals. The evolution of each individual opinion is described by a Markov chain, whose transition rates are affected by the opinions of the neighbors through influence parameters. The properties of this model are studied in a general setting as well as in interesting special cases. A general result is that the overall model of the social network behaves like a high-dimensional Markov chain, which is viable to Monte Carlo simulation. Under the assumption of identical agents and unbiased influence, it is shown that the influence intensity affects the variance, but not the expectation, of the number of individuals sharing a certain opinion. Moreover, a detailed analysis is carried out for the so-called Peer Assembly, which describes the evolution of binary opinions in a completely connected graph of identical agents. It is shown that the Peer Assembly can be lumped into a birth-death chain that can be given a complete analytical characterization. Both analytical results and simulation experiments are used to highlight the emergence of particular collective behaviours, e.g. consensus and herding, depending on the centralized tuning of the influence parameters.

0dc4ea64a8baac3efa4e2312df1a1367647329f6	vehicle routing problem based on a fuzzy customer clustering approach for logistics network optimization		Vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem seeking to service a number of customers with a fleet of vehicles. Customer characteristics are neglected in traditional VRPs in the past due to the heterogeneity and ambiguousness. This study presents a vehicle route optimization model in consideration of customer characteristics with three major components: (1) A hierarchical analysis structure is developed to convert customers’ characteristics into linguistic variables, and fuzzy integration method is used to map the sub-criteria into higher hierarchical criteria based on the trapezoidal fuzzy numbers; (2) A fuzzy clustering algorithm based on Axiomatic Fuzzy Set is proposed to group the customers into multiple clusters; (3) The fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach is integrated into the dynamic programming approach to optimize vehicle routes in each cluster. A numerical case study in Anshun, China demonstrates the advantages of the proposed method by comparing with the other two prevailing algorithms. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to capture the impacts of various evaluation criteria weights. The results indicate our approach performs very well to identify similar customer groups and incorporate individual customer’s service priority into VRP.	approximation algorithm;cluster analysis;combinatorial optimization;computational resource;customer relationship management;dynamic programming;fuzzy clustering;fuzzy set;integer programming;logistics;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;requirement;usability;vehicle routing problem	Yong Wang;Xiaolei Ma;Maozeng Xu;Yinhai Wang;Yong Liu	2015	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-151578	mathematical optimization;vehicle routing problem;fuzzy set operations	AI	-4.577637833667363	-16.33551945288247	86430

Starting from a SIR type model describing the propagation of e-rumor, we modify it by adding some external actions and control them in order to reduce the spread of a bad information. To carry out this investigation, we use known facts from optimal control theory.

7597c8f5870782393a738cd67054afe327e71ebb	on decentralized implicit negotiation in modified ultimatum game		Cooperation and negotiation are important elements of human interaction within extensive, flatly organized, mixed human-machine societies. Any sophisticated artificial intelligence cannot be complete without them. Multi-agent system with dynamic locally independent agents, that interact in a distributed way is inevitable in majority of modern applications. Here we consider a modified Ultimatum game (UG) for studying negotiation and cooperation aspects of decision making. The manuscript proposes agent’s optimizing policy using Markov decision process (MDP) framework, which covers implicit negotiation (in contrast with explicit schemes as in [5]). The proposed solution replaces the classical game-theoretical design of agents’ policies by an adaptive MDP that is: (i) more realistic with respect to the knowledge available to individual players; (ii) provides a first step towards solving negotiation essential in conflict situations.

0cf40d5b0d1984fc5cf744403fa5e9a27ff8f5a2	designing a product satisfaction model using customer segmentation and information consolidation		This study proposes a prediction model, based on Kansei Engineering, which applies the concept of consumer segmentation and information consolidation. When constructing a mutual satisfaction model for each cluster, the extracted parameters showing different levels of consumer influence were then treated as retrieval data by applying Ordinal Regression (OR). This study also tried to construct a satisfaction model for a cluster of consumers instead of just focusing on an individual satisfaction model, which is less valuable in real-life situations. The combined application of Fuzzy C-means and Ordinal Regression are considered worth using as the data needed. The combined application is less complicated compared to other forms of numerical regression analysis. It is a great benefit to designers as it lessens the time required to explore consumer satisfaction data at the early stages of the design process.	semiconductor consolidation	Meng-Dar Shieh	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39238-2_62	voice of the customer;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;business	AI	-5.795464606692821	-14.282754527277255	88513

2b31e1235d100f996832072bf9b81f91a97e526b	a meta-model for water quantity and water quality		The management of water resources requires simulati on models for different time horizons and spatial s c les as well as different types of information systems as GIS or Water Information Systems. Mathematical models int egrate former experiences and theoretical knowledge about a s ystem with actual information gained by natural pro cesses and man-induced activities. Because of the great variet y and complexity of processes considered for water management and their natural or anthropogenic origins differen t structural dynamic models have to be combined. Th e questions that must be answered for water management options are how much water is available, for what purposes it will be used, who are the actors and stakeholders, and what kind of consequences follow from distinguished man agement options for the public, agriculture and industry, a nd what kind of environmental (or ecological) respo nses result from anthropogenic activities. For this reason, and to m ake different subsystems comparable, a Meta-Model i s used.

4b1a5d1e95cde73b3a42bfd0f60b00e79bbf7b7d	dynamic strategies in a real-time strategy game	dynamic change;learning classifier system;real time strategy;computer game	Most modern real-time strategy computer games have a sophisticated but fixed ‘AI’ component that controls the computer’s actions. Once the user has learned how such a game will react, the game quickly loses its appeal. This paper describes an example of how a learning classifier system (based on Wilson’s ZCS [1]) can be used to equip the computer with dynamically-changing strategies that respond to the user’s strategies, thus greatly extending the games playability for serious gamers. 1 The Game and the Classifier System Real-time strategy (RTS) games typically involve fighting a battle against a computer opponent. This opponent typically has a very sophisticated but essentially static strategy and once the user has learned how it behaves, the game loses its playability. To get round this limitation we have used a learning classifier system (LCS) to provide the computer with the capability to dynamically change its strategy. LCSs are sometimes criticized for being slow to learn. In this example, the LCS has short conditions so as to fit in the real-time loop; success also depends on a careful choice of the types of actions. The game we implemented, using the publicly available version of the Auran Jet game engine, involves two opposing armies each consisting of two squads of 20 soldiers, moving on hilly terrain. A squad defaults to moving in a 6-6-6-2 formation but the soldiers are individually governed by a flocking algorithm [2] so that squad shapes are very fluid in battles. The essence of the game play is to jockey for position, because it pays for a squad to attack the flank of the enemy or for two squads to attack a third if its companion squad is too far away to offer support quickly enough. Figure 1 illustrates the idea. The rectangles are identifying battle-flags. The large diamond is the cursor that the user employs to command his squads, by placing the cursor somewhere and then leftor rightclicking to summon a particular squad towards that location. The classifier system sends commands to the computer’s squads, at randomlychosen times within a twoto four-second interval (experimentally determined to offer good playability). The condition part has 14 bits as follows, the values depend on the squad to be commanded. For enemy squad 1, two bits describe how far away it is; one bit indicates whether that squad is engaged in a fight; E. Cantú-Paz et al. (Eds.): GECCO 2003, LNCS 2724, pp. 1920–1921, 2003. c © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003 Dynamic Strategies in a Real-Time Strategy Game 1921 Fig. 1. Two examples of attacks one bit indicates whether that squad is stronger than this one; one bit indicates whether this squad is positionally flanking that one. Another five bits give the same data about enemy squad 2. Bits 11 and 12 give the proximity of the friendly squad, bits 13 and 14 show whether this squad and its friend are currently engaged in battle. A battle consists of a set of soldier-to-soldier fights running in parallel, each ending with the death of one combatant. A key to the success of the system is the fairly general nature of the possible actions [3]: pursue a named enemy squad, flank a named enemy squad, flee from a named enemy squad, follow the friendly squad. Unlike in the original LCS, the reward system is invoked immediately after the environment string is built and evaluates the squad’s previous action. The reward is 1000 is that action caused more kills than deaths for the squad, 0 otherwise. In experiments it took around 750 computervs-computer battles, at 15 seconds per battle on a 750MHz PC, to generate a strong opponent for a human. Human testers then found the computer opponent to be both hard to beat and hard to model, as it continued learning. This demonstrates by example that an LCS, kept suitably simple and with suitably general actions, can be the basis of an effective dynamic strategy in a real-time strategy game. The frame rate of 40-50 fps is good. Moreover, acquired strategies can be saved and exchanged with other users.	algorithm;cursor (databases);experiment;game engine;genetic and evolutionary computation conference;learning classifier system;lecture notes in computer science;pc game;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;springer (tank);switched-mode power supply	William Joseph Falke;Peter Ross	2003		10.1007/3-540-45110-2_89	non-cooperative game;video game design;combinatorial game theory;game design;game development tool;simulation;simultaneous game;computer science;win-win game;artificial intelligence;game mechanics;machine learning;metagaming;repeated game;game developer;strategy;multimedia;screening game;simulations and games in economics education;learning classifier system;sequential game	AI	-11.732026563087425	-13.40676529631611	88781

First, a mathematical model is established so that the group attempts to reach a common velocity direction. The action range of leaders is formulated by their communication range. The followers update their states according to the states of both the other followers in the vicinity and the leaders which can communicate with the current follower. After establishing a system model, we then conduct simulations to discover the effects of leaders on the consistency of a group behaviour. Finally, we obtain the following results: (a) the leader is very useful in compelling the group to be consistent, even when the impact factor of the leader is very small; (b) the total consistency of the group is determined not only by the communication range of the leader, but also by the communication range of the followers.

Communication of any sophistication demands a semantic base, but also relies on conventions of information transfer, of truthfulness, and of relevance. These are pragmatic conventions, formulated in the linguistics literature in terms of H. P. Grice's maxims of quality, quantity, and relation. Simulations offered here show that conditions sufficient for the emergence of simple semantics are also sufficient for the emergence of simple pragmatics. Pragmatic conventions of precisely the type Grice outlines emerge naturally within spatialized networks of individually information-maximizing agents in an environment of locally significant events.	emergence;expectation–maximization algorithm;relation (database);relevance;semantic network;simulation preorder	Patrick Grim	2009	2009 IEEE Symposium on Artificial Life	10.1109/ALIFE.2009.4937692	natural language processing;information transfer;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;semantic network	DB	-16.47242183765638	-12.960886430486061	89070

Two kinds of uncertainties are analyzed: data uncertainty related to the states of components, and model uncertainty related to the system structure. The components and the system structure are modeled using variables, spaces of variables, and a set of valuations represented by basic probability assignments (bpas). Besides, the positive influence of learning and cooperation processes is also quantified. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a real use case: the Car Navigation System (CNS).	architecture design and assessment system;automotive navigation system;cns;vbscript;value (ethics)	Shanqiao Qiu;Nedjemi Djameleddine Rachedi;Mohamed Sallak;Frédéric Vanderhaegen	2017	Rel.

An agent starts from a corner of a two-dimensional lattice and aims to reach a randomly selected site in the opposite side within the shortest possible time. The agent is isolated during the course of its journey and does not interact with other agents. Time-bound obstacles appear at random lattice locations and the agent must decide whether to challenge or evade any obstacle blocking its path. The agent is capable of adapting a strategy in dealing with an obstacle. We analyze the dependence of strategy-retention time with strategy for both memory-based and memory-less agents. We derive the equality spectrum to establish the environmental conditions that favor the existence of an a priori best strategy. We found that memory-less agents do not polarize into two opposite strategy-retention time distributions nor cluster toward a center distribution. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A spatial ABM includes landscapes in which agents seek resources necessary for their survival. The spatial heterogeneity of the underlying landscape plays a crucial role in the resource-seeking process. This study describes a previous agent-based model of malaria, and the modeling of its spatial extension. In both models, all mosquito agents are represented individually. In the new spatial model, the agents also possess explicit spatial information. Within a landscape, adult female mosquito agents search for two types of resources: aquatic habitats (AHs) and bloodmeal locations (BMLs). These resources are specified within different spatial patterns, or landscapes. Model verification between the non-spatial and spatial models by means of docking is examined. Using different landscapes, the authors show that mosquito abundance remains unchanged. With the same overall system capacity, varying the density of resources in a landscape does not affect abundance. When the density of resources is constant, the overall capacity drives the system. For the spatial model, using landscapes with different resource densities of both resource-types, the authors show that spatial heterogeneity influences the mosquito population. for certain aspects of the ABM to be modeled more realistically. For example, in a spatial ABM of malaria, events like obtaining a successful bloodmeal (host-seeking) or finding an aquatic habitat to lay eggs (oviposition) can be modeled by utilizing the distribution of corresponding resources in the landscape. Malaria is one of the top three pathogenspecific causes of global mortality, causing an DOI: 10.4018/jats.2011070102 18 International Journal of Agent Technologies and Systems, 3(3), 17-34, July-September 2011 Copyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Only female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles transmit human malaria, and as such are known as malaria vectors. The species Anopheles gambiae is the most important malaria vector in Sub-Saharan Africa, and one of the most efficient vectors (in terms of malaria transmission) in the world. Earlier, we developed an agent-based model derived from a conceptual entomological model of the A. gambiae lifecycle (Zhou et al., 2010; Arifin et al., 2010a; Gentile, Davis, StLaurent, & Kurtz, 2010). The model, however, was non-spatial: none of the agents and/or environments possessed any spatial attributes. In this study, we describe a spatial extension of the previous model. Though in both models, all mosquito agents are represented individually, in the new spatial model, the agents also possess explicit spatial information. We show how the previous model and the current spatial model yield consistent results with identical parameter settings (whenever applicable), and hence are docked. We also show how spatial heterogeneity affects some results in the spatial model. Spatial heterogeneity is considered as one of the most important factors for an effective representation of the environment being modeled. In the discipline of spatial epidemiology (also known as landscape epidemiology), in most cases, the probability of disease transmission significantly declines with distance from an infected host. Thus, the spatial locations of pathogens, hosts and vectors are fundamentally important to disease dynamics (Ostfeld, 2005). In modeling malaria with ABMs, representation of space may be crucial (Gu, 2009a, 2009b; Menach, 2005). The dynamics of malaria can be subject to substantial local variations that result from various spatial differences (Vries, 2001). Examples of local variations may include locations of aquatic habitats and bloodmeal events, characteristics of mosquitoes, etc. For malaria models, space can be represented as mosquito world, aquatic habitats, etc. for the mosquito agents; and as houses, huts, etc. for the human agents. In our malaria simulation, some events (e.g., host-seeking, oviposition) by nature require spatial attributes. The underlying spatial heterogeneity defines the spatial distribution of resources, and controls how easily adult female mosquitoes may find resources that are necessary to complete their gonotrophic cycle (the cycle of obtaining bloodmeals and ovipositing eggs). This, in turn, directly affects the mosquito population in the ABM (Arifin, Davis, & Zhou, 2011). In the previous non-spatial model, the resource-seeking events were modeled with separate probability distributions (to account for travel and search times incurred by adult female mosquitoes), simply because it did not have any explicit space (Zhou et al., 2010; Arifin et al., 2010a; Gentile, Davis, StLaurent, & Kurtz, 2010). For example, host-seeking and oviposition events were modeled with 25% probability of success in each hour of searching (the value of 25% was chosen as a baseline and not meant to be absolute). The spatial model, however, provides opportunities to spatially model these events by coupling them with the corresponding locations of resources in the landscape. This concept can be generalized whenever an agent needs to seek for a resource. One of the primary goals of this study is model verification, which is achieved in part by docking of the non-spatial and spatial models. Docking, also known as alignment, replication, cross-model validation, or model-to-model comparison, is a form of verification & validation (V&V) that tries to align multiple models (Kennedy et al., 2006; Xiang, Kennedy, Madey, & Cabaniss, 2005). In the past, we showed how to obtain a successful dock between separate implementations of our malaria ABMs (Arifin, Davis, Zhou, & Madey, 2010b; Arifin et al., 2010a). In this study, we show that docking significantly helps in model verification. In spatial ABMs, space can be represented in a variety of ways.

Despite committees and elections being widespread in our daily lives, the design of agents that can operate in such settings has received far less attention than the theoretical analysis of voting strategies in such settings. We address this gap by comparing people’s behavior in voting systems with that of computer agents playing various strategies. In our setting participants vote by simultaneously submitting a ranking over the set of candidates and the election system uses a plurality rule to select a ranking that minimizes disagreements with participants’ votes. We ran an extensive study in which hundreds of people participated in repeated voting rounds with other people as well as computer agents that differed in the extent to which they employ strategic reasoning in their behavior. Our results show that over time, people learned to deviate from truthful voting strategies, and use more sophisticated voting strategies. However, these strategies do not improve people’s performance because of the erratic nature of their behavior. In particular, a computer agent using a best response voting strategy to people’s actions in the previous round was able to outperform people in the game as well as an agent using truthful voting strategies. This result has implication for agent designers, highlighting the types of strategies that facilitate voting behavior in committees comprising both human and computer participants.	software agent	Moshe Bitan;Ya'akov Gal;Sarit Kraus;Elad Dokow;Amos Azaria	2013			bullet voting;artificial intelligence;cardinal voting systems;computer security;disapproval voting	AI	-14.278003174376545	-11.499013781614384	89496

Especially fluctuations in climate values should be reduced in order to avoid damages of the sensitive materials of cultural heritage. In several applications no modern ventilation systems are present, such that the only ventilation option is the opening of windows and doors by human. Therefore serious climate fluctuations occur, if the ventilation strategy is not adapted to the climate situation. To avoid this situation, a monitoring and decision support system has to be developed. In this contribution we describe a fuzzy concept for such a system, analyze the influence of the fuzzy approach and explain the practical realization in a demonstrator application.	algorithm;climate model;decision support system;fuzzy concept;fuzzy logic;internet protocol suite;microsoft windows;requirement;stationary process	Christian Arnold;Steven Lambeck;Christoph Ament	2012	2012 6th IEEE International Conference Intelligent Systems	10.1109/IS.2012.6335167	simulation;architectural engineering;engineering;environmental resource management	Robotics	-11.45952455806149	-21.703935204359873	89709

A company’s environmental performance is not only related to the company’s inner environmental efforts, but also it is affected by the suppliers’ environmental performance and image. For industries, environmentally responsible manufacturing, return flows, and related processes require green supply chain (GSC) and accompanying suppliers with environmental/green competencies. During recent years, how to determine suitable and green suppliers in the supply chain has become a key strategic consideration. Therefore this paper examines GSC management (GSCM) and GSCM capability dimensions to propose an evaluation framework for green suppliers. However, the nature of supplier selection is a complex multi-criteria problem including both quantitative and qualitative factors which may be in conflict and may also be uncertain. The identified components are integrated into a novel hybrid fuzzy multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) model combines the fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Model (DEMATEL), the Analytical Network Process (ANP), and Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) in a fuzzy context.

However, current decision-theoretic models are either purely individual or purely collective and find it difficult to deal with motivational attitudes. On the other hand, mental-state based models find it difficult to deal with uncertainty. We describe two hybrid decision models: 1) the collective 'versus' individual (CvI), which integrates both strata quantitative evaluation of decision making; 2) the CvI-JI which extends the CvI model, using the joint-intentions formulation of teamwork, to deal with collective mental-state motivational attitudes. Both models are evaluated from an experimental, case study-based, outlook that explores the tradeoff between cost reduction and loss of optimality while learning coordination skills in a partially observable stochastic domain.	molecular dynamics	Paulo Trigo;Helder Coelho	2010	IJRIS	10.1504/IJRIS.2010.029815	simulation;uncertainty;teamwork;decision theory;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;management science;emergency management;statistics	ECom	-15.498424432426441	-12.772589247684117	89820

It is widely recognized that such networks can correlate behaviors (and arguably preferences) among connected agents. We introduce a model for social choice—specifically, consensus decision making—on such networks that reflects certain interdependencies among agent utilities. Specifically, we define an empathetic social choice framework in which agents derive utility based on both their own intrinsic preferences and the satisfaction of their neighbors. We show how this problem translates into a weighted form of classical preference aggregation (e.g., social welfare maximization or certain forms of voting), and develop effective algorithms for consensus decision making that we believe should scale to large-scale (online) social or economic networks. Preliminary experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.	expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;interaction;interdependence;social network aggregation	Amirali Salehi-Abari;Craig Boutilier	2014			aggregation problem;social choice theory;voting;social competence	AI	-14.047464453019344	-15.203500110947248	89899

In such situations recommender applications help to identify the products and/or services that fit the user’s wishes and needs. In order to successfully apply recommendation technologies we have to develop an in-depth understanding of decision strategies of users. These decision strategies are explained in different models of human decision making.

The reason of this inadequacy is due to the high degree of complexity of the physical mechanisms that govern these systems. It is proposed in this paper to shift the attention from modeling the engineering system itself to modeling the uncertainty that underlies its behavior. A mathematical framework for modeling the uncertainty in complex engineering systems is developed. This framework uses the results of computational learning theory. It is based on the premise that a system model is a learning machine.	alexey chervonenkis;complexity;computational learning theory;empirical risk minimization;mit engineering systems division;mathematical model;statistical learning theory;system identification;vc dimension;vapnik–chervonenkis theory	A.

In urban regions, effective emergency management is highly dependent on reliable knowledge about potential traffic congestion hotspots that can arise during an evacuation. Spatially explicit models that combine network science and optimization techniques within a Geographic Information System (GIS) can target the unique physical, biological, and social characteristics of an area to provide more locally relevant evacuation traffic congestion predictions. The objective of this study is to design and implement the Network Science Emergency Evacuation Model (NetSEEM) using spatially explicit network science principles. The NetSEEM design is theoretically robust and can be adapted for different geographic areas and hazard types to represent the specific complexity of emergency evacuation situations. The developed NetSEEM model is applied to four evacuation scenarios in the City of Burnaby, BC, Canada. The results show expected congestion patterns at the major transportation intersections, and highlight NetSEEM as an exploratory management tool to anticipate and mitigate traffic congestion during context-dependent emergency evacuations.	network science	Micah L.

6c0b245d007ce1e86386d8b982d90090096fffcd	studying the generation of alternatives in public policy making processes		The design of alternatives is an essential part of decision making that has been less studied in theory and practice compared to alternatives’ evaluation. This topic is particularly relevant in the context of public policy making, where policy design represents a crucial step of the policy cycle since it determines the quality of the alternative policies being considered. This paper attempts to formalise the decision aiding process in two real interventions dealing with alternatives’ generation for territorial policy making in Italy. The aim of this research is to understand what generates novelty within the alternatives’ design phase of a decision aiding process, i.e. what allows to expand the solution space and discover new alternatives to solve the problem under consideration. It demonstrates ways in which novelty in decision processes can be supported by Operational Research/Multicriteria Decision Aiding tools. The two case studies are used to answer the following questions: (i) Why have new alternatives arose during the policy making process? (ii) How have they been generated? (iii) Which consequences did they lead to? and (iv) What generated novelty in the process? The results highlight two main reasons that can expand the solution space within a decision aiding process: (i) dissatisfaction (of the client, of the analyst or of the relevant stakeholders, especially when dealing with public policies) with respect to the solutions currently proposed to the decision making problem and (ii) opportunity for a change in one of the variables/constraints.

The duration of the latent state depends on the opinion adopted by the voter. This leads to a bias toward consensus on the opinion that is associated with the shorter latency. We determine the exit probability and time to consensus for systems of N voters.

An aggregate planning method, which translates early product characteristics into manufacturing requirements, forms the basis of a new intelligent support system for which the manufacturing evaluation, optimization and reporting functions are described in this paper. The system ‘intelligently explores’ the many alternative processing technologies and equipment choices available, seeking solutions that best satisfy a multi-criteria objective function encapsulating quality, cost, delivery and knowledge criteria. The addition of knowledge factors means that both quantitative and qualitative factors can be used to rank alternatives. Importantly, the system prioritizes each element according to its potential for improvement. The designer is thus presented with the opportunity to redefine the design elements or process specifications, which would yield the greatest improvements in production.	aggregate data;artificial intelligence;design for manufacturability;display resolution;enterprise resource planning;evolutionary computation;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;production system (computer science);requirement prioritization;synergy	D.

21df5fc7e75d54d59e356c429fb6c24804cb05ef	excessive co-movement effect and evolution network analysis of chinese stock market		In order to better understand mutual influences among stock price fluctuations, we treat stocks on the market as nodes, collecting closing price data of The Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index from 2014 to 2016. And we use the partial correlation coefficient to measure the linkage effect between stocks. Specifically, through the selection of a certain threshold, we get a financial complex network with stock linkage effect. Furthermore, we use Newman Fast analysis algorithm to divide Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index network into 15 communities. It turns out that the correlation within the community is significantly closer than the correlation between the community and the outside community, which is called close price-fluctuating plate. Moreover, through the time division that is used to analyze the structure of stock network community, we may conclude that banks, securities and real estate stocks' prices are basically a synchronous change during this period. And there are also some stocks which have excessive co-movement effect changes asynchronously. The results of our work can not only provide inner information and linkage on the stock market capital flows, but also can explore the evolution of the stock market rules.	closing (morphology);cluster analysis;clustering coefficient;complex network;complexity;greedy algorithm;linkage (software);network model	Shang Zhen;Qinxin Wu;Xiong Wang	2017	2017 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)	10.1109/SII.2017.8279215	engineering;control engineering;financial economics;network analysis;stock market;stock (geology);complex network;real estate;partial correlation	OS	-12.181361992310375	-17.018012968486474	92038

We developed an Internetbased decision-support system, 4S Tool (Forest Stand Software Support System), which is designed to encourage informed forest management and to bridge the gap between a new generation of family forest owners (e.g. exurbanites) and natural resources professionals. We describe the technical and educational components of the 4S Tool and present several considerations for application to other geographic regions. The tool requires users to provide information on the species group, typical tree size, and density of trees in their forest. Users also select a forest management technique to apply to their ‘‘virtual forest.’’ The tool then estimates forest dynamics and wildlife habitat availability for up to 40 years into the future. The output provides projected changes in commercial timber, as well as changes in the diversity of berries, ferns, herbs, flowers, birds, and mammals as a consequence of the selected management option. Projected changes are based on primary and secondary data sources and modeled via the Forest Vegetation Simulator. 4S Tool provides a means of enhancing landowner awareness of options associated with management of forest property and provides users with access to additional resources and natural resource professionals to aid in future forest planning efforts. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

9ac2aae5ee109d6642abb6177ee4b2235cbac182	a new multiple criteria decision making method and its application in cloud computing for education		Cloud computing can extend the traditional education framework. In education, cloud can provide students and teachers with tools to deploy computing resources on-demand for lectures and labs according to their learning needs. But how to select a perfect cloud server is a key point, which is considered as a multiple criteria decision making problem. So, in this paper, intuitionistic fuzzy set is first introduced to express the decision maker’s views. Intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) includes a membership function and a non-membership function. More importantly, a new operator with choquet integral is developed to deal with assessment of education using cloud computing.

df75a7b96cc8753e18f2ac75bda35e71ff52dab1	an approach to quality function deployment based on probabilistic linguistic term sets and oreste method for multi-expert multi-criteria decision making		Abstract The quality function deployment (QFD) is an effective tool to translate the customer requirements (CRs) to the design requirements (DRs) of a product. The process of selecting the optimal innovative product design to maximize customer satisfaction is full of uncertainty and fuzziness regarding to the users’ preferences, the relationships between CRs and DRs and the merits of product designs. This study proposes a multi-expert multi-criteria decision making method to solve the innovative product design selection problem by developing an enhanced QFD method combined with the complicated fuzzy linguistic representation model, the probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS), and the ranking method, ORESTE. Firstly, we propose a probability aggregation method to integrate the individuals’ subjective evaluations into group ones expressed as PLTSs. On this basis, we extend the QFD into the probabilistic linguistic context to get the DRs’ fuzzy weights. Then, based on a new distance measure between PLTSs, a probabilistic linguistic global preference score function and three kinds of probabilistic linguistic preference intensity formulas are proposed. Furthermore, we develop a PL-ORESTE method to obtain the preference, indifference and incomparability relations between the alternatives. For the facility of application, we develop the procedure of the QFD-based PL-ORESTE method. Given that the “shared cars” is a new industry appeared in Chinese market, we finally illustrate the applicability of the proposed method by a case study concerning the selection of innovative designs of Panda shared cars.	quality function deployment;software deployment	Xingli Wu;Huchang Liao	2018	Information Fusion	10.1016/j.inffus.2017.11.008	machine learning;customer satisfaction;fuzzy logic;artificial intelligence;linguistics;data mining;mathematics;pattern recognition;quality function deployment;product design;ranking;probabilistic logic	Vision	-4.969110894769279	-17.455117115690957	92535
14f3c3cee908fb7b46f3baca8c976466bc37c6bd	a decision support system for supplier selection process	quality function deployment;preemptive goal programming;support system;analytical hierarchy process;supplier selection	Today's global business environment, characterized by unprecedented competitive pressures and sophisticated customers that demand speedy solution creates a bigger set of potential suppliers to evaluate and to choose from. To deal with the complexities of the supplier selection process, an integration of Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Preemptive Goal Programming (PGP) techniques is proposed. A QFD matrix is used to display the degree of relationship between each pair of requirement for suppliers and supplier evaluating criterion. This paper employs the AHP first to measure the relative importance weighting for each of the requirements in the QFD process. Secondly, it is used to assess the evaluating score for each of the candidate suppliers for each particular supplier-evaluating criterion. PGP is built to deal with some suppliers' constraints such that the total value of purchase (TVP) becomes maximum and the total cost of purchase (TCP) minimum.	decision support system	Oboulhas Conrad Tsahat Onesime;Xiaofei Xu;De-chen Zhan	2004	International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making	10.1142/S0219622004001197	quality function deployment;analytic hierarchy process;economics;operations management	Arch	-4.691717570521424	-15.419946445674558	92568

This fact poses two related but distinct problems, which are often confused the one with the other: (1) the phylogenetic problem regarding how can communication evolve if the two traits that are necessary for its emergence are complementary and seem to require each other for providing reproductive advantages; (2) the adaptive problem regarding how can communication systems that do not advantage both signallers and receivers in the same way emerge, given their altruistic character. Here we clarify the distinction, and provide some insights on how these problems can be solved in both real and artificial systems by reporting experiments on the evolution of artificial agents that have to evolve a simple food-call communication system. Our experiments show that (1) the phylogenetic problem can be solved thanks to the presence of producer biases that make agents spontaneously produce useful signals, an idea that is complementary to the well-known ‘receiver bias’ hyopthesis found in the biological literature, and (2) the adaptive problem can be solved by having agents communicate preferentially among kin, as predicted by kin selection theory. We discuss these results with respect both to the scientific understanding of the evolution of communication and to the design of embodied and communicating	emergence;evolution;experiment;intelligent agent;microsoft kin;norm (social);phylogenetics;whole earth 'lectronic link	Marco Mirolli;Domenico Parisi	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-01250-1_9	genealogy;communication;social psychology	AI	-15.569283545146996	-14.067895043563169	92713

Such an exploration setting is applicable to various multi-agent systems, e.g., in Dynamic Spectrum Access exploration. The goal in such problems is to optimize the process as a whole, considering the tradeoffs between the quality of the solution obtained and the cost associated with the exploration and coordination between the agents. Through the analysis of the two extreme cases where coordination is completely free and when entirely disabled, we manage to extract the solution for the general case where coordination is taken to be costly, modeled as a fee that needs to be paid for each additional coordinated agent. The strategy structure for the general case is shown to be threshold-based, and the thresholds which are analytically derived in this paper can be calculated offline, resulting in a very low online computational load.	computation;multi-agent system;online and offline	Igor Rochlin;David Sarne	2013			simulation;management science;cooperation	AI	-15.881891922693528	-11.502091460228941	93033
43600dcf22726a06a69f9c776082d2d9323a12c2	ordering effects and belief adjustment in the use of comparison shopping agents		The popularity of online shopping has contributed to the development of comparison shopping agents (CSAs) aiming to facilitate buyers’ ability to compare prices of online stores for any desired product. Furthermore, the plethora of CSAs in today’s markets enables buyers to query more than a single CSA when shopping, thus expanding even further the list of sellers whose prices they obtain. This potentially decreases the chance of a purchase based on the prices outputted as a result of any single query, and consequently decreases each CSAs’ expected revenue per-query. Obviously, a CSA can improve its competence in such settings by acquiring more sellers’ prices, potentially resulting in a more attractive “best price”. In this paper we suggest a complementary approach that improves the attractiveness of a CSA by presenting the prices to the user in a specific intelligent manner, which is based on known cognitive-biases. The advantage of this approach is its ability to affect the buyer’s tendency to terminate her search for a better price, hence avoid querying further CSAs, without having the CSA spend any of its resources on finding better prices to present. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated using real data, collected from four CSAs for five products. Our experiments with people confirm that the suggested method effectively influence people in a way that is highly advantageous to the CSA.	comparison shopping website;design of experiments;exemplification;experiment;heuristic;line search;online and offline;online shopping;terminate (software)	Chen Hajaj;Noam Hazon;David Sarne	2014			artificial intelligence;marketing;machine learning;attractiveness;computer science;popularity;revenue	AI	-6.7695901604208775	-11.13436138769927	93034

The proposed reinforcement learning algorithm is an advantageous and indispensable tool for ALBidS (Adaptive Learning strategic Bidding System), a multi-agent system that has the purpose of providing decision support to electricity market negotiating players. ALBidS uses a set of different strategies for providing decision support to market players. These strategies are used accordingly to their probability of success for each different context. The approach proposed in this paper uses a Bayesian network for deciding the most probably successful action at each time, depending on past events. The performance of the proposed methodology is tested using electricity market simulations in MASCEM (Multi-Agent Simulator of Competitive Electricity Markets). MASCEM provides the means for simulating a real electricity market environment, based on real data from real electricity market operators.	reinforcement learning	Tiago M.

The decision for these factors is the key to the railway location design optimization. In this paper, high-speed railway location system is established based on GIS technology. The design parameters are obtained by a series of analyses to the influence factors. The analyses include buffer analysis, overlay analysis, network analysis and hierarchical analysis. By adjusting the technical constraints or environmental indicators, the multi-factor, multi-parameter comprehensive quantitative evaluation system for high-speed railway location is realized. Finally according to the hierarchy model of the final evaluation system of optimal railway location decision, the weight of program level and criterion level and the weight of criterion level are integrated to determine the ultimate weight of the program level to object level.

Although a great number of models have been proposed for studying a variety of social phenomena, no general agent design methodology is available. Moreover, it is difficult to validate the accuracy of these models. For this reason, we believe that some guidelines for ABMs design must be devised; therefore, this paper is a first attempt to analyze the levels of ABMs, identify and classify several aspects that should be considered when designing ABMs. Through our analysis, the following implications have been found: (1) there are two levels in designing ABMs: the individual level, related to the design of the agents’ internal structure, and the collective level, which concerns the design of the agent society or macro-dynamics of the model; and (2) the mechanisms of these levels strongly affect the outcomes of the models.	agent-based model;programming paradigm;social system	Yutaka I.

With periodic states for agents and an interaction rule of repeated averaging, we numerically find two types of metastable states at low- and high-E limits, respectively, along with consensus states. If we apply this model to opinion dynamics, metastable states can be interpreted as sustainable diversities in our societies, and our results then imply that, while diversities decrease and eventually disappear with more long-range interactions, other types of diverse states can appear under this rule when networks are almost fully connected.	interaction network;numerical analysis;randomness;societies	Suhan Ree	2012	Physical review.

Such problems as global warming, species extinction, overpopulation, poverty, drought, to name but a few, raise questions about the degree of sustainability of our society. To answer sustainability questions, one has to know the meaning of the concept and possess mechanisms to measure it. In this paper, we examine a number of approaches in the literature that do just that. Our focus is on analytical quantitative approaches. Since no universally accepted definition and measuring techniques exist, different approaches lead to different assessments. Despite such shortcomings, rough ideas and estimates about the sustainability of countries or regions can be obtained. One common characteristic of the models herein is their hierarchical nature that provides sustainability assessments for countries in a holistic way. Such models fall in the category of system of systems. Some of these models can be used to assess corporate sustainability.	apple sos;data assimilation;ecology;fuzzy logic;gradient;holism;progress indicator;system of systems	Yannis A. Phillis;Vassilis S.

We applied an agent-based model to explore the potential effectiveness of a payment for ecosystem services (PES) design through a biodiversity rich rubber eco-certification scheme. We integrated conditionality, where compliance with biodiversity performance indicators is prerequisite for awarding incentives. We compared a PES policy scenario to ‘business-as-usual’ and ‘subsidized land use change’ scenarios to explore potential trade-offs between ecosystem services delivery and rural income. Results indicated that a rubber agroforest eco-certification scheme could reduce carbon emissions and species loss better than alternative scenarios. However, the suggested premiums were too low to compete with income from other land uses. Nevertheless, integrating our understanding of household agent behavior through a spatially explicit and agent-specific assessment of the trade-offs can help refine the design of conservation initiatives such as PES. © 2014 The Authors.

However, the current procedure for building such a catalog causes wastage of time because the modelers in the shipyard must perform manual modeling of the 3D CAD data in order to decrease the size of 3D CAD data and adopt a different level of detail (LOD) depending on the purpose of its use. This problem arises because equipment suppliers are not willing to give all of their 3D CAD data to shipyards, out of fear of the loss of intellectual property. Moreover, the 3D CAD data of equipment suppliers have a high LOD, while a shipyardu0027s 3D CAD data have a relatively low LOD. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce an automated method to simplify the 3D CAD assembly data for equipment that is received from the equipment supplier. In addressing this problem, this study first proposes criteria for a simplification process and quantitative evaluation metrics for the simplification of 3D CAD assembly data, considering the characteristics of equipment data in the shipbuilding industry. Based on these findings, a simplification system was developed, and, four experimental test cases that were conducted on-site were used to verify the proposed system. The results showed that the data to be stored could be reduced to at least 25% of the original 3D CAD assembly data while ports, outer boundaries, and connectivity between CAD parts could be maintained. Display Omitted Shipyards need simplified equipment 3D CAD assembly data for system-level design.Three simplification operations applicable for 3D CAD assembly data are developed.Evaluation metrics considering multiple simplification criteria are proposed.The evaluation metrics allow discriminatory priority of specific criteria.	computer-aided design;text simplification	Soonjo Kwon;Byungchul Kim;Duhwan Mun;Soonhung Han	2015	Computer-Aided Design	10.1016/j.cad.2014.03.003	topology;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;level of detail;mathematics;engineering drawing;simplification;mechanical engineering	EDA	-9.303105609479625	-13.326515852522533	94926

In the evolutionary games, players update their strategies in accordance with certain rules. This paper presents a new learning rule, in keeping with player's aspiration-based risk preference. A definition of risk preference factor is also proposed to describe the aspiration level. Our new model proves that a player will potentially take more dominant strategy if the payoff is below expectation. Our sufficient experiments and the simulation results on scale-free network indicate that our new strategy-updating rule affects the evolution of cooperation. For small multiplication factors, the frequency of cooperation increases as the aspiration level increases. For large multiplication factors, intermediate levels of aspiration prove to be optimal for the successful evolution of public cooperation.

This paper proposes a new approach to analyze the input-output table. From the network derived from the table, we estimate the effect of an external factor which is behind the scene. By introducing imaginary node into the network so as not to change the current situation, we can obtain the hidden relation. The newly added links of the imaginary node represents the relation between the external factor and internal nodes. We demonstrate that the relation between industrial sectors and a government can be obtained from this method.	complex network;computation;genetic algorithm;imaginary time;input/output;time complexity	Kien Tran;Masao Kubo;Hiroshi Sato	2017	2017 Joint 17th World Congress of International Fuzzy Systems Association and 9th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems (IFSA-SCIS)	10.1109/IFSA-SCIS.2017.8023308	machine learning;artificial intelligence;the imaginary;computer science;input/output;government	Robotics	-11.358974883551642	-18.296875876175633	96176

Thus, a senior decision maker often use a group of experts as the supportive team to ensure appropriate decisions. The experts often have different expertise level regarding their knowledge, talent, proficiency, and experience. In this study, we first extend the best-worst method based on the linguistic preferences of decision-makers about importance of attributes. These preferences are converted into triangular fuzzy numbers to be utilized in the linear programming model. That is, in contrast with the original best-worst method in which the preferences towards the attributes are crisp, fuzzy preferences are considered in the proposed method to reflect the imprecise comments of experts. Second, we propose a novel group decision making approach based on the fuzzy bestworst method to combine the opinion of senior decision-maker and the opinions of the experts. Indeed, our model helps the senior decision-maker to make a significant trade-off between democratic and autocratic decision-making styles. From sensitivity analyses on two numerical examples, we show that, when there is conflict between senior decision-maker and group of decision-makers, the consistency of group decision-making (democracy) will increase as it tends to individual decision-making (autocracy).	best practice;coefficient;decision theory;fuzzy set;game-maker;linear programming;numerical analysis;plausibility structure;programming model;the good judgment project;verification and validation	Ashkan Hafezalkotob;Arian Hafezalkotob	2017	Appl.

The system's core is a decision support tool (DST), consisting of a risk assessment framework aimed at computing risks related to each action that can be performed on the maritime operation under consideration. In particular, the risks are computed for each action and for each class describing the forecasted condition of the environment (favourable, marginal, and unfavourable), according to their posterior probabilities. A fuzzy classifier is used to estimate such probabilities, starting from the forecast of the environmental variables affecting the operation. A distinctive feature of the implemented DSA is its flexibility: many different types of operations can be handled (amphibious landing, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) recovery, etc.) with no architectural change.

26bb789d47fe016dbdbe00cfafa8822b999b5181	the hunger games: embodied agents evolving foraging strategies on the frugal-greedy spectrum		In Evolutionary Biology and Game Theory, there is a long history of models aimed at predicting strategies adopted by agents during resource foraging. In Artificial Life, the agentbased modeling approach allowed to simulate the evolution of foraging behaviors in populations of artificial agents embodied in a simulated environment. In this paper, different sets of behaviors are evolved from a simple setting where agents seek for food patches distributed on a two-dimensional map. While agents are not explicitly playing a game of chicken, their strategies are found on a spectrum ranging from a frugal strategy (aka Dove) to a greedy strategy (aka Hawk). This phenomenon is due to the fact that moving is both a way for the agents to play or go to get away from an unfavorable area of the environment. It is also observed that by moving away, the agents preserve the ecology, preventing the resource from disappearing locally. Those strategies are shown to be stable if the environment is colonized by one given population. However, post-mortem tournaments among different groups of agents (separately evolved), systematically result in a specific group of agents dominating. The optimal strategy in the simulated tournaments is found to be one with fine-tuned timing for leaving. Further analysis shows how the strategy exploits resources without completely depleting them, producing Volterra-like population tendencies.	artificial life;ecology;embodied agent;game theory;goto;greedy algorithm;intelligent agent;population;simulation;virtual reality	Nathanaël Aubert-Kato;Olaf Witkowski;Takashi Ikegami	2015		10.7551/978-0-262-33027-5-ch065	biology;simulation;artificial intelligence;ecology	AI	-15.448266719977495	-14.37575953945326	96289
71f61d29bd9aa1433b213d65c44c7264db22038d	research on the classification of the relationships among the same layer elements in assurance case structure for evaluation		The use of assurance cases in certification raises the question of assurance argument sufficiency and the issue of confidence (or uncertainty) in the argument’s claims. Some researchers propose to model confidence quantitatively and to calculate confidence in argument conclusions. However, most of the existing assurance evaluation techniques focus on top-bottom decomposition and assume that the elements of the same level are independent of each other. The lack of information on the relationships among supporting elements of the same level may easily lead to deviations from estimation expectations. In this paper, a modified approach for evaluation of confidence in assurance cases is proposed. Firstly, in order to eliminate the deviation from the independence hypothesis, we discuss the relationships of the supporting elements for confidence evaluation and propose a simple classification. Then we compare the different confidence results under the independence assumption and the correlation assumption using the same confidence evaluation method, and discuss the causes of differences. Finally, we discuss several future work.

58da8949e0bccab01a0384f40b0834e4c1a56994	an uncertainty-aware integrated fuzzy ahp-waspas model to evaluate public cloud computing services		Abstract Cloud service evaluation and selection has emerged as a significant challenge for consumers and organizational decision makers due to the proliferation and exponential growth of cloud services over the internet. The plethora of cloud service providers (CSPs) with a range of functionally similar public cloud services, makes it difficult for the service consumers to select the appropriate and optimal cloud services. Several evaluation models have been proposed in the past few years. However, existing literature lacks a systematic procedure aggregating the user feedback and real-world performance assessment data, while incorporating the uncertainty involved in the subjective human preferences. In addition, existing literature reports constrained evaluation criteria while neglecting several decisive factors. In this study, we formulate this problem as a Multi-Criteria Decision making (MCDM) problem and develop an integrated decision model based on Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Weighted Aggregated Sum-Product Assessment (WASPAS) methods. A comprehensive and multi-dimensional hierarchical model is structured which comprises of 9 primary and 30 secondary evaluation factors. Relative weight assessment of the primary and secondary evaluation factors, is performed through FAHP with extent analysis and WASPAS is used to rank the candidate cloud services. A case study on six real-world Public cloud services is performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model. Finally, the robustness of the proposed model is validated through sensitivity analysis.	cloud computing	Khubaib Amjad Alam;Rodina Ahmed;Faisal Shafique Butt;Soon-Gohn Kim;Kwang-Man Ko	2018		10.1016/j.procs.2018.04.068	data mining;robustness (computer science);fuzzy logic;multiple-criteria decision analysis;analytic hierarchy process;decision model;cloud computing;the internet;hierarchical database model;computer science	SE	-6.099799768351301	-16.394330756279924	96353

The approach is a unique composite of a computer simulation of a tsunami and collective evacuation behaviors, along with a series of workshops and evacuation drills to discover a feasible solution for successful evacuation without merely considering it a hopeless endeavor. The new tsunami estimation, reissued after the 3.11 catastrophe, is extremely severe, including warnings of 30-meter waves that could arrive only a few minutes after an earthquake. Given such dire warnings, people are likely to be too pessimistic and to feel hopeless in terms of evacuating after a tsunami. This research is aimed at developing an effective communication method, with the collaboration of a computer simulation, to encourage local residents in finding a practical and feasible way to evacuate and to avoid excess pessimism and hopelessness.	catastrophe theory;catastrophic interference;computer simulation;field research;offset binary	Fuko Nakai;Michinori Hatayama;Katsuya Yamori	2015	2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2015.33	computer simulation;data modeling;simulation;interview;computer science;computational model	Visualization	-18.01168369381299	-21.41904745284032	96493
8bdc60b1de20af9bcb21b3ab87d1bd7030c66271	an expert system for financial performance assessment of health care structures based on fuzzy sets and kpis	fuzzy sets;performance assessment of health care;key performance indicators;adaptive models;expert system	Interest in the field of performance assessment of health care structures has grown in recent decades. In fact, the possibility of determining overall performances of health care structures plays a key role in the optimization of resource allocation and investment planning, as it contributes to reducing the uncertainty of future performance. In this context, key performance indicator (KPI) tools have been developed to assess the performance of health care structures from process, organizational, cost, financial, and output points of view. In practice, they are periodically calculated, and the effect of several KPIs on the overall performance of health care structures is determined by management through human judgment or software that provides synthetic dashboards. Given their non-stationary nature, performance assessment and forecasting are generally tackled by employing adaptive models, but these approaches cannot reflect the holistic nature of performance itself, nor take into account the impact of KPIs on the overall performances. In order to overcome these shortcomings, this study presents an expert system whose engine relies on fuzzy sets, in which the input–output relations and correlations have been modeled through inference rules based on time-series trends. The focus is on the financial performance assessment of a health care structure, such as a hospital. The approach is of an interdisciplinary kind, as several indicators were taken as inputs that relate to output, process, and cost KPIs, and their impact on the output measure, which is of a financial kind (namely the total reimbursement). The output measure calculated by the expert system was then compared with that predicted using only adaptive forecasting models, and the error with respect to the actual value was determined. Results showed that measures determined by fuzzy inference, able to effectively model actual input–output relations, outperform those of adaptive models. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we apply agent based solutions to a class of problems defined by their property of being predictable  from a macroscopic perspective while being highly stochastic when viewed at a microscopic level. These characteristic properties  can be found in several industrial processes and applications, e.g. within the energy market where the production and distribution  of electricity follow this pattern. We evaluate and compare the performance of the agent system in three different scenarios,  and for each such scenario it is shown to what degree the optimization system is dependent on the level of availability of  sensor data.

In a context such as Western industrialized one, in which birth control induces a feature of consciousness into fertility conduct, reproductive intentions have a fundamental role. This paper examines the mechanism which leads to the formation of reproductive behaviour starting from intentions, with reference to a large city in Italy, where fertility is very low, Milan. In addition, the hypothesis that women have innate and unobservable propensities toward family formation is verified through a simultaneous equations model. It allows to control for the potential endogeneity of reproductive intentions in determining subsequent behaviour. Results partially confirm this hypothesis: no significant correlation is found between unobservable components influencing intentions and behaviour. The relevance of reproductive intentions for subsequent fertility behaviour is, however, pointed out.	consciousness;endogeneity (econometrics);gauss–hermite quadrature;numerical analysis;numerical integration;relevance;simultaneous equations model	Silvia Meggiolaro	2010	Statistical Methods and Applications	10.1007/s10260-009-0115-2	econometrics;mathematics;simultaneous equations model	AI	-14.605832406940445	-15.696391072035203	97428

Particularly, we find that when there is a dimensionality reduction (i.e., a change from a two-dimensional issue space to a one-dimensional one, or, a substantial decrement in one of the issue’s relative importance with respect to the other), the number of political parties declines, as does the overall degree of party fragmentation in the system.

An important policy is the Performance Evaluation (ED), since it allows the control and monitoring of management indicators, both individual and by process. To analyze the results, decision making in many organizations is done in a subjective manner and in consequence it brings serious problems to them. Taking into account this problem, it is decided to design and apply diffuse mathematical procedures and tools to reduce subjectivity and uncertainty in decision-making, creating work algorithms for this policy, which includes multifactorial weights and analysis with measurement indicators that they allow tangible and reliable results. Statistical techniques (ANOVA) are also used to establish relationships between work groups and learn about best practices.	fuzzy logic;performance evaluation	Noel Varela Izquierdo;Omar Bonerge Pineda Lezama;Rafael Luciano Gómez Dorta;Amelec Viloria;Ivan Deras;Lissette Hernández-Fernández	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-93818-9_16	fuzzy logic;management science;analysis of variance;best practice;business;subjectivity;human resource management;working group	Embedded	-6.183900443513184	-16.086630941384126	97608

The wider aim is to provide a comprehensive map of the kinds of transitions and learning that take place in constructing simple emergent behaviors, particularly for young children. Six kindergarten children participated individually in the study along five sessions. Regarding modes of engagement, it was found that the children conducted intensive and extended playful investigations of the robot’s behaviors, interacting with it in a variety of ways; it was also found that their constructions were planful and anticipatory, as they could simulate how the behaviors play out even prior to running their programs. Three kinds of transitions were found in the children’s comprehension of the system: one involved adaptation to the formal language; the second, coordination of multiple spatial perspectives; and the third involved a shift from viewing rules as one-time events to their view as recurring and continual descriptions of a process. Finally, it was found that the children employed two strategies to reduce the amount of information in the system: ‘‘pruning’’ involved ignoring part of the logical structure and focusing on another; ‘‘fusing’’ involved coalescing several rules or functions into one. These results are discussed with respect to previous literature on children’s programming and with regards to understanding and supporting young children’s learning through their construction of adaptive autonomous behaviors.	autonomous robot;complex adaptive system;emergence;formal language;interaction;list comprehension;logic programming;simulation	Sharona T.

ab577b20785a7e22d6d9cf1c1846904e51cf8cb0	evaluation of preconditions affecting symptomatic human error in general aviation and air carrier aviation accidents		Abstract Human error remains the leading cause of accidents in the aviation industry, as technological reliability and system safety have undergone significant improvements. Improved methods are required to model the events resulting in human error incidents. In this study, aviation accident data are evaluated to model the association between the latent and symptomatic causal factors resulting in aviation mishaps. We comparatively analyze National Transportation Safety Board accident data for general aviation and air carrier pilots in order to evaluate potential causal factors. The demonstrated methodology leverages previous work in causal relationships by using multiple-variable logistic regression to model the relationships among latent causal factors, symptomatic causal factors, and accident severity. The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System is applied to define a framework intended to identify focal areas for the safety community to mitigate similar future system failures. The results demonstrate an effective methodology for evaluating the quantitative relationships between symptomatic and latent causal factors, which are not readily apparent based solely on occurrence rates. Furthermore, the results also clarify the differences in causal factors between the selected general aviation and air carrier pilot operations. The usefulness of the framework, transferability to other domains, and possibilities for future research are discussed.	human error;precondition	Anthony J. Erjavac;Ronald Iammartino;John M.

Introducing concepts of ‘value’ of interactions and ‘satisfaction’ as generic network performance measures, we show that the underlying organizing principle is to meet an overall performance target for wide-ranging operating or environmental conditions. This design or survival requirement of reliable performance under uncertainty leads, via the maximum entropy principle, to the emergence of a power law vertex degree distribution. The theory also predicts exponential or Poisson degree distributions depending on network redundancy, thus explaining all three regimes as different manifestations of a common underlying phenomenon within a unified theoretical framework.	complex network;degree (graph theory);degree distribution;emergence;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;holism;interaction;network performance;organizing (structure);principle of maximum entropy;time complexity	Venkat Venkatasubramanian;Dimitris Nicolas Politis;Priyan R.

While in reality agents are not all present in the system simultaneously, previous work has studied static settings where all relevant information is known upfront. Our goal is to better understand the dynamic setting. On the conceptual level, we develop a dynamic model of fair division, and propose desirable axiomatic properties for dynamic resource allocation mechanisms. On the technical level, we construct two novel mechanisms that provably satisfy some of these properties, and analyze their performance using real data. We believe that our work informs the design of superior multiagent systems, and at the same time expands the scope of fair division theory by initiating the study of dynamic and fair resource allocation mechanisms.	agent-based model;computational resource;institute for operations research and the management sciences;mathematical model;multi-agent system	Ian A.

The network contains 58 countries and 37 activity sectors for years 1995 and 2008. The construction of G, based on Markov chain transitions, treats all countries on equal democratic grounds while the contribution of activity sectors is proportional to their exchange monetary volume. The Google matrix analysis allows to obtain reliable ranking of countries and activity sectors and to determine the sensitivity of CheiRank-PageRank commercial balance of countries in respect to price variations and labor cost in various countries. We demonstrate that the developed approach takes into account multiplicity of network links with economy interactions between countries and activity sectors thus being more efficient compared to the usual export-import analysis. The spectrum and eigenstates of G are also analyzed being related to specific activity communities of countries.

However, each entity receives payoffs when providing services, which leads to competition between SOs and service entities or within internal service entities. In this paper, we first formulate the price competition model of SOs where the SOs dynamically increase and decrease their service prices periodically according to the number of collected services from entities. A game based services price decision (GSPD) model which depicts the process of price decisions is proposed in this paper. In the GSPD model, entities game with other entities under the rule of “survival of the fittest” and calculate payoffs according to their own payoff-matrix, which leads to a Pareto-optimal equilibrium point. Numerous experiments demonstrate that the GSPD model can explain the price dynamics in the real world, and also can help decision makers a lot under various scenarios.	cyber-physical system;decision support system;entity;experiment;game theory;loose coupling;mathematical optimization;pareto efficiency	Xiao Liu;Mianxiong Dong;Kaoru Ota;Patrick C.

These criteria frequently involve subjective and complex characteristics that must be adequately assessed to produce the proper decision about the most suitable profile among the available job applicants. A Fuzzy Multicriteria tool is suggested to help on the choice of the most promising applicant among the available candidates. Fuzzy sets are used to represent and manipulate the uncertain criteria of the problem in a computer system. The Multicriteria technique explores the fuzzy criteria in order to produce a preference ranking order of the applicants for the employment. As an important complement to this proposal, a CBR (Case-Based Reasoning) mechanism is presented as an additional tool for decision aid and as a mechanism of incremental learning. A practical real situation is also presented to illustrate the functional process of this approach.	case-based reasoning	Gleiber Fernandes Royes;Rogério Cid Bastos;Golber Fernandes Royes	2003	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems		decision support system;human resources;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;management science;fuzzy set	Robotics	-5.79438151409424	-16.268762763349578	98389

Despite the advantages of intercropping like improved soil fertility, protection against pests and diseases and eventual increase in farm yield, this farming practice is faced with challenges—inadequate planning, bad crop management and lack of required intercropping expertise. Consequently, this has resulted in inadequate reward for farmers and a general decline in crop production. In this regard, the authors present an Intelligent and Integrated Intercropping Decision Support System for Intercropping (IDSS-I) for improved crop production. The design adopts a forecasting component that provides farmers with the estimated yield and income depending on the size of land, soil type and weather condition. Although the implementation was carried out using JAVA and SQL, usability testing revealed 85% acceptance of the tool among the contacted 10 large scale farmers. It was also confirmed that the system provided 95% diagnosis information for 90% common Africa crop diseases.	intelligent decision support system;java;sql;usability testing	Adesina Simon Sodiya;Adio T.

We have developed a novel framework for quantification of supply chain risks that integrates two techniques of Bayesian belief network and Game theory. Bayesian belief network can capture interdependency between risk factors and Game theory can assess risks associated with conflicting incentives of stakeholders within a supply network. We introduce a new node termed ‘Game theoretic risks’ in Bayesian network that gets its qualitative and quantitative structure from the Game theory based analysis of the existing policies and partnerships within a supply network. We have applied our proposed risk modeling framework on the development project of Boeing 787 aircraft. Two different Bayesian networks have been modeled; one representing the Boeing’s perceived supply chain risks and the other depicting real time supply chain risks faced by the company. The qualitative structures of both the models were developed through cognitive maps that were constructed from the facts outlined in a case study. The quantitative parts were populated based on intuition and subsequently updated with the facts. The Bayesian network model incorporating quantification of game theoretic risks provides all the reasons for the delays and financial loss of the project. Furthermore, the proactive strategies identified in various case studies were verified through our model. Such an integrated application of two different quantification techniques in the realm of supply chain risk management bridges the mentioned research gap. Successful application of the framework justifies its potential for further testing in other supply chain risk quantification scenarios. 1998 ACM Subject Classification I.2.3 Deduction and Theorem Proving	bayesian network;cognitive map;financial risk modeling;game theory;interdependence;natural deduction;network model;population;risk management	Abroon Qazi;John Quigley;Alex Dickson	2014		10.4230/OASIcs.SCOR.2014.1	economics;knowledge management;operations management;management science	AI	-11.02126697307717	-17.85147956352085	98541

In these models, a fixed rule has been imposed on each individual a priori for its interactions in a reductive and rigid manner. We have proposed a new framework for self-organized grouping of agents by reinforcement learning. It is important to introduce a learning scheme for developing collective behavior in artificial autonomous distributed systems. This scheme can be expanded to cases in which predators are present. We integrated grouping and anti-predator behaviors into our proposed scheme. The behavior of agents is demonstrated and evaluated in detail through computer simulations, and their grouping and antipredator behaviors developed as a result of learning are shown to be diverse and robust by changing some parameters of the scheme. In this study, we investigate the network structure of agents in the process of learning these behaviors. From the view point of the complex network, the average shortest path length and clustering coefficient are evaluated through computer simulations.	multi-agent system;reinforcement learning	Koichiro Morihiro;Nobuyuki Matsui;Teijiro Isokawa;Haruhiko Nishimura	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15393-8_66	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	ML	-17.167519654127734	-14.089152859910358	98835

231ed1fbfc8db1b15d28c2e260cd295e36f0ee32	sustainability-based selection decisions for e-waste recycling operations		Selecting operation alternatives for processing a recycling job is an important decision in managing e-waste recycling operations. This paper develops a novel approach to making selection decisions for e-waste recycling operations based on their sustainability performance under environmental, economic, and social dimensions. This approach addresses two new and important issues under a new selection problem structure. A job-oriented assessment method with a fuzzy knowledge base is constructed to address the first issue of how to consistently assess the performance of operation alternatives for a given recycling job with the precise or imprecise specification of the job attributes. A sustainability-based optimal weighting model is developed to address the second issue of how to determine optimal weighting for the three sustainability dimensions to reflect the company’s sustainability concerns and priorities under specific operational settings. With the assessment method and the optimal weighting model, the overall sustainability performance of each operation alternative for a given recycling job can be obtained, on which the selection decision can be made. To examine the effectiveness of the approach, an empirical study on an e-waste operation alternatives selection problem of an Australian e-recycler is conducted. The job-oriented sustainability-based selection approach significantly enhances the efficiency, consistency, and sustainability of processing e-waste recycling jobs.	computer recycling;electronic waste	Yan Xu;Chung-Hsing Yeh	2017	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-016-2269-2	environmental resource management;operations management;management science	Crypto	-5.071498659298695	-16.681635997972077	99476

Its object domain is soft computing using as its basic elements different methods from the areas of fuzzy logic, cognitive maps, neural networks and genetic algorithms. FCMs, more specifically, use notions borrowed from artificial intelligence and combine characteristics of both fuzzy logic and neural networks, in the form of dynamic models that describe a given political setting. The present work proposes the use of the genetically evolved certainty neuron fuzzy cognitive map (GECNFCM) as an extension of certainty neuron fuzzy cognitive maps (CNFCMs) aiming at overcoming the main weaknesses of the latter, namely the recalculation of the weights corresponding to each concept every time a new strategy is adopted. This novel technique combines CNFCMs with genetic algorithms (GAs), the advantage of which lies with their ability to offer the optimal solution without a problem-solving strategy, once the requirements are defined. Using a multiple scenario analysis we demonstrate the value of such a hybrid technique in the context of a model that reflects the political and strategic complexity of the Cyprus issue, as well as the uncertainties involved in it. The issue has been treated on a purely technical level, with distances carefully kept concerning all sides involved in it.	activation function;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;c11 (c standard revision);fuzzy cognitive map;fuzzy logic;game-maker;genetic algorithm;neuron;problem solving;requirement;scenario analysis;soft computing;via c7	Andreas S.

Each individual can have one of two opinions that can change according to that of his neighbors. It is dominated by an overwhelming majority and can disagree against a marginal one. We present the phase diagram in the mean field approximation and from numerical experiments for the simplest nontrivial case. For arbitrarily large neighborhoods we discuss the mean field results for a non-conformist society, where each individual adheres to the overwhelming majority of its neighbors and choses an opposite opinion in other cases. Mean field results and preliminary lattice simulations with long-range connections among individuals show the presence of coherent temporal oscillations of the population. 1 Modeling social pressure and political transitions What happens to a society when a large fraction of people switches from a conformist to a non-conformist attitude? Is the transition smooth or revolutionary? These important questions, whose answers can make the difference between two well-known political points of view, is approached using a theoretical model, in the spirit of Latané’s social impact theory [1, 2]. We assume that one’s own inclination towards political choices originates from a mixture of a certain degree of conformism and non-conformism. Conformists tend to agree with the local community majority, that is with the average opinion in a given neighborhood, while non-conformists do the opposite. However, an overwhelming majority in the neighborhood (which includes the subject itself) is always followed. We shall study here the case of a homogeneous population, i.e. a homogeneous democratic society. It may be considered as the annealed version of a 1 The case with strong leader was studied in Ref [3]. real population, which is supposedly composed by a mixture of conformist and non-conformist people who do not change easily their attitude. In Sec. 2 we introduce a class of probabilistic cellular automata characterized by the size 2r+1 of the neighborhood, a majority threshold q, a coupling constant J and an external field H . We are interested in the two extreme cases: people living on a one-dimensional lattice, interacting only with their nearest neighbors (r = 1) and people interacting with a mean-field opinion. In Sec. 3 we present the simplest case where each individual interacts with his two nearest neighbors (r = 1), the mean field phase diagram and the one found from numerical experiments. For this simple case, we find a complex behavior which includes first and second order phase transitions, a chaotic region and the presence of two universality classes [6]. In Sec. 4 we discuss the mean field behavior of the model for arbitrary neighborhoods and majority thresholds when the external field is zero and the coupling constant is negative (non-conformist society). The phase diagram of the model exhibits a large region of coherent temporal oscillations of the whole populations, either chaotic or regular. These oscillations are still present in the lattice version with a sufficient large fraction of long-range connections among individuals, due to the small-world effect [7].	approximation;automata theory;chaos theory;coherence (physics);conformity;coupling constant;interaction;lattice gauge theory;marginal model;network switch;numerical analysis;phase diagram;population;simulation;small-world experiment;stochastic cellular automaton;universality probability	Franco Bagnoli;Fabio Franci;Raúl Rechtman	2002		10.1007/3-540-45830-1_24	phase transition;cellular automaton;artificial intelligence;mean field theory;mathematics;algorithm	ML	-13.886760935545272	-16.70851021791699	99880

We simulate a multi-asset agent-based artificial stock market composed of heterogeneous agents with different degrees of relative risk aversion. As before, we find that the difference in risk aversion and the resultant saving behavior are the primary forces in determining the survivability of agents. In addition to the stability of the saving behavior, the level of the saving rate also plays a crucial role. The agents with stable saving behavior, e.g., the log-utility agents, may still become extinct because of their low saving rates, whereas the agents with unstable saving behavior may survive because of their high saving rates, implied by their highly risk-averse preferences. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

A logical next step is to use the wisdom of the crowd philosophy to solve complex problems and produce informed policy. We introduce a new approach to aggregating the beliefs and preferences of many individuals to form models that can be used in social policy and decision-making. Traditional social choice functions used to aggregate beliefs and preferences attempt to find a single solution for the whole population, but may produce an irrational social choice when a stalemate between opposing objectives occurs. Our approach, called collective belief aggregation, partitions a population into collectives that share a preference order over the expected utilities of decision options or the posterior likelihoods of a probabilistic variable. It can be shown that if a group of individuals share a preference order over the options, their aggregate will uphold principles of rational aggregation defined by social choice theorists. Super-agents can then be formed for each collective that accurately represent the preferences of their collective. These super-agents can be used to represent the collectives in decision analysis and decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the potential of using collective belief aggregation to incorporate the objectives of stakeholders in policy-making using preferences elicited from people about healthcare policy.	aggregate data;decision analysis;programming paradigm;requirements elicitation;social network aggregation;wiki;wisdom of the crowd	Kshanti A.

For example, in Beijing, vehicles are now fiercely competing for the right of roads with the existing large amount of bicycles. Because many streets in Beijing are not fully channelized to separate vehicles and bicycles, such competition leads to notable growth of traffic accidents and decline of traffic efficiency. This important matter has attracted growing research interests recently. In this paper, a behavior modelling and simulation for conflicts in vehicles-bycicles mixed flow is proposed.

The success of the group, however, crucially depends on how the judgments of the group members are aggregated to produce the collective answer. A large variety of such aggregation methods have been described in the literature, such as averaging the independent judgments, relying on the majority or setting up a group discussion. In the present work, we introduce a novel approach for aggregating judgments-the transmission chain-which has not yet been consistently evaluated in the context of collective intelligence. In a transmission chain, all group members have access to a unique collective solution and can improve it sequentially. Over repeated improvements, the collective solution that emerges reflects the judgments of every group members. We address the question of whether such a transmission chain can foster collective intelligence for binary-choice problems. In a series of numerical simulations, we explore the impact of various factors on the performance of the transmission chain, such as the group size, the model parameters, and the structure of the population. The performance of this method is compared to those of the majority rule and the confidence-weighted majority. Finally, we rely on two existing datasets of individuals performing a series of binary decisions to evaluate the expected performances of the three methods empirically. We find that the parameter space where the transmission chain has the best performance rarely appears in real datasets. We conclude that the transmission chain is best suited for other types of problems, such as those that have cumulative properties.	cognition disorders;collective intelligence;computer simulation;judgment (mathematical logic);markov chain;numerical analysis;performance;population parameter;social system;supply chain attack	Mehdi Moussaïd;Kyanoush Seyed Yahosseini	2016		10.1371/journal.pone.0167223	collective animal behavior;intelligence;social influence;bioinformatics;bioacoustics	Web+IR	-15.1933215875762	-14.59084634478839	100283

Valuable ecosystems, which are less viable against external non-natural pressures, deserve more protection. Such an assessment is a multiple attribute analysis process due to involvement of several decision criteria. The problem in such a process is the fact that the required information is not always precisely defined. In addition, the interactions of an ecosystem with the other surrounding ecosystems and with the external non-natural disturbance cannot be effectively expressed via simple quantified indicators. In this sense, assessment of viability by qualitative terms provides an opportunity to utilize experts' judgments to comprehensively address the viability attributes, and in particular, interactions of ecosystems with each other and with the external disturbance and pressure factors. In doing so, in this study, a methodology for viability assessment of ecosystems is proposed based on joint consideration of theory of multiple attribute analysis and fuzzy set theory to deal with qualitative and imprecise information. A novel approach on the basis of conjunction implication method is constructed capable of considering fuzziness in both partial scores and weights. The method will be examined using three classes of ordering approaches proposed in literature. To illustrate the usefulness and the applicability of the proposed approach, it will be employed in a case study for viability assessment of ecosystems within the reach area of an oil-sand mining project.

While a multitude of factors exist that affect the ability of a unit to achieve success in mission, an accurate assessment of readiness is crucial and drives federal funding, defense policy, and deployment decisions. The current readiness metric for the U.S. Army statically assesses units on personnel, equipment on hand, equipment readiness/serviceability, and unit training proficiency using a weakest-link approach. This leads to reporting challenges and the tendency for commanders to subjectively upgrade their units’ assessments. This research proposes a metric that evaluates units with greater precision, flexibility, and robustness. By taking a decision analysis approach and using desirability functions, we are able to measure readiness based on a set of priorities, adapting for type of mission and unit.

Few geographic researches have analyzed offender (as opposed to offense) data at a large map scale (i.e., using a relatively small areal unit of analysis) to minimize aggregation effects. Providing context is the social disorganization theory, which hypothesizes that areas with economic deprivation, high population turnover, and high ethnic heterogeneity exhibit social disorganization and are expected to facilitate higher instances of young offenders. Non-spatial and spatial Poisson models indicate that spatial methods are superior to non-spatial models with respect to model fit and that index of ethnic heterogeneity, residential mobility (1 year moving rate), and percentage of residents receiving government transfer payments are, respectively, the most significant explanatory variables related to young offender location. These findings provide overwhelming support for social disorganization theory as it applies to offender location in York Region, Ontario. Targeting areas where prevalence of young offenders could or could not be explained by social disorganization through decomposing the estimated risk map are helpful for dealing with juvenile offenders in the region. Results prompt discussion into geographically targeted police services and young offender placement pertaining to risk of recidivism. We discuss possible reasons for differences and similarities between the previous findings (that analyzed offense data and/or were conducted at a smaller map scale) and our findings, J. Law (&) M.

Increasing demands resulting from urban development and other human activities within coastal lake catchments have the potential to result in their degradation and can lead to conflicts, for example between lake users and upstream communities. There are many techniques that can be used to integrate the variables involved in such conflicts including system dynamics, meta-modelling, and coupled component models, but many of these techniques are too complex for catchment managers to employ on a routine basis. The overall result is the potential to compromise the sustainability of these important ecosystems. This paper describes research to address this problem. It presents the development of an integrated model framework based on a Bayesian network (Bn). Bns are used to assess the sustainability of eight coastal lake-catchment systems, located on the coast of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The paper describes the potential advantages in the use of Bns and the methods used to develop their frameworks. A case study application for the Cudgen Lake of northern NSW is presented to illustrate the techniques. The case study includes a description of the relevant management issues being considered, the model framework and the techniques used to derive input data. Results for the case study application and their implications for management are presented and discussed. Finally, the directions for future research and a discussion of the applicability of Bn techniques to support management in similar situations are proffered.	bayesian network	Jenifer L.

d7d4c48db0c6d1795ef7f0dbc70ec05869d7ca7b	the influence of periodic external fields in multi-agent models with language dynamics		We investigate large-scale effects induced by external fields, phenomenologically interpreted as mass media, in multiagent models evolving with the microscopic dynamics of the binary naming game. In particular, we show that a single external field, broadcasting information at regular time intervals, can reverse the majority opinion of the population, provided the frequency and the effectiveness of the sent messages lie above well-defined thresholds. We study the phase structure of the model in the mean field approximation and in numerical simulations with several network topologies. We also investigate the influence on the agent dynamics of two competing external fields, periodically broadcasting different messages. In finite regions of the parameter space we observe periodic equilibrium states in which the average opinion densities are reversed with respect to naive expectations. Such equilibria occur in two cases: (i) when the frequencies of the competing messages are different but close to each other; (ii) when the frequencies are equal and the relative time shift of the messages does not exceed half a period. We interpret the observed phenomena as a result of the interplay between the external fields and the internal dynamics of the agents and conclude that, depending on the model parameters, the naming game is consistent with scenarios of first- or second-mover advantage (to borrow an expression from the jargon of business strategy).	agent-based model;approximation;jargon;kind of quantity - equilibrium;mass media;multi-agent system;network topology;numerical analysis;numerous;population parameter;simulation;strategic management;timeshift;density;message	Filippo Palombi;Stefano Ferriani;Simona Toti	2017	Physical review.

While the entrant uses a new technology, the monopolist is free either to stick to his former technology or to switch to the new one.

Several systems have been built [e.g.1–6], and have been used since a few years by those Railway Authorities wishing to have a good cost/benefit ratio. To ensure an adequate dependability of the systems coming to operation, many standards exists (like the new ERTMS [7–9]) which establish targets on the dependability attributes, like safety, reliability and availability, and prescribe methodologies for system specification, design, verification and validation. As a consequence, evaluations are necessary for the system assessment and the fault forecasting. These evaluations may be performed both during the design phase, in order to test if the behaviour of the architecture under study is as expected, or to compare different solutions, and during the verification phase, to assess whether the developed system satisfies the assigned targets. System assessment can be performed using several approaches like testing, fault injection often combined with analytical models. The modelling approach is generally cheap for manufacturers and has proven to be useful in all the phases of the system life cycle. During the design phase, models allow us to compare different solutions and to select the most suitable one (among those obeying other design constraints), and to highlight problems within the design. In assessing an already built system, models allow to characterise specific aspects, to detect dependability bottlenecks and to suggest solutions to be adopted in future releases. In the literature several papers exist in the field of dependability analysis [e.g. 10–15].

The methodology imposes certain consistency requirements on alternative models of the same phenomena. We apply this methodology to the incorporation of exploration and development and wellhead price regulation of natural gas into the integrated energy policy model. Finally, we present four policy simulations with the integrated model. These simulations are the four possible combinations of quotas on oil imports versus no quotas and phased deregulation of the price of natural gas versus no deregulation.

With the emerging applications of multi-agent systems, there is always a need for simulation to verify the results before the actual implementation. Multi-agent simulation provides a test bed for several soft computing algorithms like fuzzy logic, neural networks (NN), probabilistic reasoning (stochastic learning automata, reinforcement learning), and evolutionary algorithms (genetic algorithms). Fusion of soft computing methodology with existing simulation tools yields several advantages in simulating multi-agent systems. Such a fusion provides a novel and systematic way of handling tune-dependent parameters in the simulation without altering the essential functionality and problem solving capabilities of soft computing elements. The fusion here is the extension of the capabilities of simulation tools with intelligent tools from soft computing. This paper proposes a methodology for combining the agent-based architecture, discrete event system and the soft-computing methods in the simulation of multi-agent systems and defines a framework called virtual laboratory (V-Lab/spl reg/) for realizing such multi-agent system simulations. Detailed experimental results obtained from simulation of robotics agents and wireless sensor network is also discussed.	agent-based model;artificial neural network;automata theory;complex adaptive system;control system;evolutionary algorithm;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithm;learning automata;multi-agent system;problem solving;reinforcement learning;robotics;simulation;soft computing;software engineering;testbed	Prasanna Sridhar;Mo M.

My APRIL parser analyses natural-language grammar by optimizing a labelled tree over an input string using the stochastic optimization technique of simulated annealing. Stochastic optimization is inherently processing-intensive, so it is desirable to speed the process up by exploiting the power of parallel computing; but the task of optimizing a tree structure does not at first sight lend itself to being shared between multiple processors. I define an algorithm which allows this to be done at the cost of requiring individual processors to operate with imperfect knowledge of the current solution; and I describe results of an implementation of this algorithm which suggest that the cost may be worth paying.	mathematical optimization;paradiseo;parsing	Geoffrey Sampson	1991	J.

Each node in the social network holds a (possibly different) cognitive network that represent its beliefs. In this internal cognitive network a node denotes a concept and a link indicates whether the two linked concepts are taken to be of a similar or opposite nature. We show how these networks naturally organise into communities and use this to develop a method that detects communities in social networks. How they organise depends on the social structure and the ratio between the cognitive and social forces driving the propagation of beliefs.	applicative programming language;approximation algorithm;belief propagation;cognitive network;emergent;graph rewriting;image scaling;network model;simulation;social network;social structure;socio-cognitive;software propagation	Vincent Danos;Ricardo Honorato-Zimmer	2016	2016 IEEE 1st International Workshops on Foundations and Applications of Self* Systems (FAS*W)	10.1109/FAS-W.2016.19	psychology;dynamic network analysis;artificial intelligence;communication;social psychology;social network	DB	-16.71908360990318	-15.753937815011962	102557
14714519a4bb98ed2e3a1337d81fedabe68a9f0e	an efficient trust estimation model for multi-agent systems using temporal difference learning		In multi-agent system (MAS) applications, teamwork among the agents is essential as the agents are required to collaborate and pool resources to execute the given tasks and complete the objectives successfully. A vital part of the collaboration is sharing of information and resources in order to optimize their efforts in achieving the given objectives. Under such collaborative environment, trust among the agents plays a critical role to ensure efficient cooperation. This study looks into developing a trust evaluation model that can empirically evaluate the trust of one agent on the other. The proposed model is developed using temporal difference learning method, incorporating experience gained through interactions into trust evaluation. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the developed model against some of the most recent models reported in the literature. The results of the simulation experiments indicate that the proposed model performs better than the comparison models in estimating trust more effectively.	comparison of raster-to-vector conversion software;experiment;information;interaction;multi-agent system;simulation;temporal difference learning;trust (emotion)	G.

New protocols to extract urban networks from spatial interaction data within a regional space are proposed. Bayesian Networks are later used to produce a model of the evolution of these networks. The results of prospective simulations of the future evolution of regional urban networks are subsequently integrated in a GIS platform to obtain an appropriate cartographic representation. GIS modelling and mapping integrate the probabilistic content of the model results, representing the degree of uncertainty in the knowledge of the future state of every component of the regional system.

In Canada, for example, the regulatory policy includes a quantitative limit on radiological risk to an individual for a period of 10,000 years following disposal. Mathematical modeling of the performance of the disposal system is essential to demonstrate that the system meets such quantitative criteria. There is considerable uncertainty in modeling the system because of the limited knowledge of both the geological environment of the disposal facility and the behavior of the engineered and natural components of the system far into the future. Procedures to reduce the uncertainty must be carried out during the entire life of the disposal project, and the uncertainty must be quantified to the extent possible. It is important that the limitations of the models be recognized, as well as their effectiveness in providing essential information in the siting, design, and regulatory process. A case study based on the concept proposed for the disposal of nuclear fuel waste in Canada demonstrates the use of mathematical modeling of a disposal system.	mathematical model	K. W.

Over the years, the human factor has attracted more and more attention, and different aspects of the work have been taken into account to prevent and/or reduce the number of accidents and incidents and improve human performance in industrial systems. The selection of adequate work-rest policies through the introduction of appropriate breaks is a very efficient approach even if it is not widely applied. It is well known that introducing breaks is a key intervention to provide recovery after fatiguing physical work, prevent the growth of accident risks during working activities, and improve human reliability and productivity for individuals engaged in either mental or physical tasks.#R##N##R##N#This paper focuses on the simulator for human error probability analysis (SHERPA) model for the break scheduling problems. This model aims to predict the human error probability (HEP) and assess the impact of the context via performance shaping factors. The main focus of SHERPA is modeling and simulation of rest breaks in every working context and conditions in order to reduce errors and increase productivity and efficiencies. As shown in the case study, the model is useful in assessing the impact of different work-break policies, with different placement and duration of breaks, on human performance (HEP and recovery after the break) and on the overall system performance in terms of percentage of compliant performed tasks and economic results.	scheduling (computing)	Valentina Di Pasquale;Fabio Fruggiero;Raffaele Iannone;Salvatore Miranda	2017	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2017.05.017	recovery;simulation;engineering;human factors and ergonomics;operations management;human reliability;forensic engineering	Robotics	-10.44830805461114	-15.786086274773035	103256
cc78453826f1d3472b6753147542a94159c91141	a multi-agent model for urban water-energy-food sustainable development simulation		Water, energy and food are basic resource for sustainable urban development. It has been acknowledged that there are numerous complex non-linear interconnections among them, or called WEF-Nexus, meaning that any strategies that focus on single resource would lead to unexpected results. As one of the most effective tools for simulating the complex system, Agent-Based Modeling has a unique advantage in optimizing WEF allocation and promoting its use efficiency at the city level. Basing on characters of various agents in a complex urban system, this paper first divides various agents into three types: household, firm and government, which are all living in the same urban space and sharing independent but competitive demand for WEF resources respectively. And then under the guidance of behavior rules for household, firm and government agents, Netlogo programmable modeling environment are proposing to explore the complex interaction between those three agents in the process of WEF production and consumption. On the basis of WEF-Nexus with different agents, we finally build a new Multi-Agent Model, and conclude that by setting some sustainable development goals, this model can effectively simulate the urban WEF consumption pattern and its dynamic changes with the evolution of time.	agent-based model;complex system;netlogo;nonlinear system;simulation	Guijun Li;Yongsheng Wang;Daohan Huang;Hongtao Yang	2017		10.1145/3126973.3126991	complex system;netlogo;environmental resource management;sustainable development;government;urban planning;engineering	AI	-15.865017400052315	-20.602405281649705	103269

However, experiments show that people will punish free riders, even at considerable cost. To examine the implications of agents who punish, we simulate an environment populated with behavioral strategies seen in the lab and use the simulation to develop hypotheses about why group size should matter when punishment is allowed. We test these hypotheses experimentally and examine whether the effect of group size is purely due to the number of group members or if information about other group members is what is important. We find that large groups contribute at rates no lower than small groups because punishment does not fall appreciably in large groups. However, hindrances to monitoring do reduce the provision of the public good.

In this article, we focus on the specific task of reallocating buses from different lines of a previously planned system in case of restrictions regarding the breakdown of vehicles and/or absent drivers. For this purpose, we present a fuzzy decision tree that combines the graphical representation of decision trees, which are highly interpretable, with the mechanisms to handle linguistic attributes of the fuzzy systems. The model was induced using real data collected from a public bus system with 26 bus lines. The collected data includes 16 attributes related to characteristics of the bus lines and users. Such data basically present input values for the 16 attributes, as well as an expert decision on the reallocation of buses. The final induced models include reduced sets of key-attributes. The idea is to use the fuzzy decision trees to support human experts to make decisions regarding reallocating buses from lines in order to optimize the average time that users have to wait for a bus service. The models induced by the FuzzyDT algorithm were compared to RIPPER, J4.8, NaiveBayes, and a Multi-layer Perceptron. The FuzzyDT induced models presented superior results in terms of error rates and interpretability. The models use reduced sets of attributes and are highly interpretable.	algorithm;bus (computing);decision tree model;fuzzy control system;multilayer perceptron	Marcos E. Cintra;Jose F. F.

First of all, the geology, topography and other information were analyzed to establish the landslide geological hazard database of Zigui segment; then, the digital elevation model (DEM) of such this segment was built by inputting each data in the form of map layer into the GIS (geographical information system) and combing geography information system technology; some geography information was collected, such as elevation, slope direction, gradient as well as the distance to the river; then the geological information of the research area was collected according to the geological survey data, such as formation lithology, geological structure, and so on; at last, the six indexes presented above were considered as evaluation factors to establish a landslide geological hazard model. Each information value of each layer was calculated by the model to obtain the information map of a single factor; then they were accumulated to obtain the integrate information map of the whole research area, namely, the landslide hazard shot chart. The landslide geological hazard area was divided into four grades in accordance with different shots: stability area, low-dangerous area, middle-dangerous area and high-dangerous area. It is indicated by the evaluation result that information model, which can well service the research of landslide hazard, is an effective method to carry out regional geological hazard forecast. The evaluation result can provide references for reservoir engineering safety, environmental protection as well as natural disasters prevention and reduction to realize the informationization and scientificalization of landslide geological hazard prevention and reduction.	digital elevation model;effective method;geographic information system;gradient;information model;risk management;topography	Rnixiang Liao;Shimei Wang;Haifeng Huang;Feifei Xu	2011	Proceedings 2011 IEEE International Conference on Spatial Data Mining and Geographical Knowledge Services	10.1109/ICSDM.2011.5969093	digital elevation model;regional planning;hazard;information model;landslide;value of information;geographic information system;silicon;remote sensing;reservoir	DB	-10.135999613846039	-21.996815338505854	103721
315a9262c0bc91660cb5a6d62cce4c7375f915f8	vulnerability of opportunistic parking assistance systems to vehicular node selfishness	non cooperative information dissemination;opportunistic parking assistance systems;vehicular networks	Opportunistic networking leverages the volume, heterogeneity and mobility of end user nodes to foster the dissemination of information in the absence of network infrastructure. Nevertheless, in competitive settings (where the possession of information itself is an asset) user nodes often face a strategic dilemma: cooperate, to realize the network and support the information flow, or not do so, to gain competitive advantage over the other nodes. In this paper, we investigate realistic scenarios of opportunistic parking assistance service that instantiate such dilemmas. Ideally the vehicular nodes opportunistically collect and share information on the location and availability status of the parking spots. Yet the competition for parking spots may give rise to various facets of misbehaviors, such as deferring from sharing information (free riders) and/or deliberately falsifying disseminated information (selfish liars) so as to divert others away from a particular area of own interest. Simulation results indicate that misbehaviors tend to reduce the distance between the destination and the occupied parking spot for all vehicles at the expense of higher parking search times. However, misbehaving nodes fail to obtain any substantial performance advantage that would indeed encourage their misbehaviors. The addition of Mobile Storage Nodes compensates for the reduction of the information flow due to free riders but has almost no effect against selfish liars. Simple analytical models drawing on mean-field arguments provide further evidence for the fundamental dynamics that emerge from the interaction of the vehicular nodes. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

205dd835bc83aaeb8ed2284b6d2df800600669f4	a markovian model of evolving world input-output network		The initial theoretical connections between Leontief input-output models and Markov chains were established back in 1950s. However, considering the wide variety of mathematical properties of Markov chains, so far there has not been a full investigation of evolving world economic networks with Markov chain formalism. In this work, using the recently available world input-output database, we investigated the evolution of the world economic network from 1995 to 2011 through analysis of a time series of finite Markov chains. We assessed different aspects of this evolving system via different known properties of the Markov chains such as mixing time, Kemeny constant, steady state probabilities and perturbation analysis of the transition matrices. First, we showed how the time series of mixing times and Kemeny constants could be used as an aggregate index of globalization. Next, we focused on the steady state probabilities as a measure of structural power of the economies that are comparable to GDP shares of economies as the traditional index of economies welfare. Further, we introduced two measures of systemic risk, called systemic influence and systemic fragility, where the former is the ratio of number of influenced nodes to the total number of nodes, caused by a shock in the activity of a node, and the latter is based on the number of times a specific economic node is affected by a shock in the activity of any of the other nodes. Finally, focusing on Kemeny constant as a global indicator of monetary flow across the network, we showed that there is a paradoxical effect of a change in activity levels of economic nodes on the overall flow of the world economic network. While the economic slowdown of the majority of nodes with high structural power results to a slower average monetary flow over the network, there are some nodes, where their slowdowns improve the overall quality of the network in terms of connectivity and the average flow of the money.	aggregate data;anatomic node;input/output;markov chain;mathematics;money;node - plant part;perturbation theory;probability;semantics (computer science);shock;steady state;time series;total number	Vahid Moosavi	2017		10.1371/journal.pone.0186746		Metrics	-12.37604893432036	-17.205573899647547	104348

Since Turkish metropolitan cities have been attracting a large population from smaller cities and rural areas, it has caused a considerable increase in the population of the big cities of Turkey. The growth in population and the enormous shift of people from old to newly developed districts in Istanbul also create new spending demand areas. This is the most powerful motivation to generate new sites in the city for locating attractive shopping centers. A number of conflicting qualitative and quantitative criteria exist for evaluating alternative sites. Qualitative criteria are often accompanied by ambiguities and vagueness. This makes fuzzy logic a more natural approach to this kind of multi criteria decision making (MCDM) problems. The paper proposes a combined MCDM methodology. Fuzzy AHP (analytic hierarchy process) is utilized for assigning weights of the criteria for site selection and fuzzy TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) is used to determine the most suitable alternative using these criteria weights. The study was followed by the sensitivity analysis of the results.		Semih Önüt;Tugba Efendigil;Selin Soner Kara	2010	Expert Syst.

6975145cd994ba3f9c0aa8701c91c46ba8b1f831	environment classification in multiagent systems inspired by the adaptive immune system		The adaptive immune system in vertebrates is a complex, distributed, adaptive system capable of effecting collective multicellular responses. Our study introduces many of the desirable properties of this biological system to decentralized multiagent systems. We adopt the crossregulation model of the adaptive immune system involving interactions between effector and regulatory cells. Effector cells can mount beneficial immune responses to microbial antigens as well as pathologic autoimmune responses to self-antigens. Deleterious autoimmunity is prevented by regulatory cells that suppress the effectors to tolerate the self-antigens. We redeploy the crossregulation model within a multiagent system by letting each agent run an ODE-based instance of the model. Results of extensive simulation-based experiments demonstrate that a distributed multiagent system can mount different responses to distinct objects in their environment. These responses are solely a result of the dynamics between virtual cells in each agent and interactions between neighboring agents. The collective dynamics gives rise to a meaningful “self”-“nonself” classification of the environment by individual agent, even if these categories were not prescribed a priori in the agents.	adaptive system;agent-based model;biological system;customer relationship management;experiment;interaction;multi-agent system;open dynamics engine;persistence (computer science);persistent data structure;self;simulation;stepping level	Danesh Tarapore;Anders Lyhne Christensen;Pedro U.

An agent may not trust a source because of lack of positive evidence, but this does not necessarily mean the agent distrusts the source. Trust and distrust have to be considered as two separate concepts which can coexist. We are aware that an adequate way to take this fact into account is by considering explicitly not only the agent’s degree of trust in a source but also its independent degree of distrust. Explicitly taking distrust into account allows us to mark a clear difference between the distinct notions of negative trust and insufficient trust. More precisely, it is possible, unlike in approaches where only trust is explicitly accounted for, to “weigh” differently information from helpful, malicious, unknown, or neutral sources.	agent-based model;apache axis;coexist (image);distrust;emoticon;interaction;malware;multi-agent system;optic axis of a crystal;software bug	Célia da Costa Pereira	2009			public relations;express trust;political science;social psychology;computer security	AI	-17.225314019146523	-15.1235825067103	105065
ba898fa87af917316e7884e798971611bef69f0d	smart pedestrian crossing management at traffic light junctions through a fuzzy-based approach		In the last few years, numerous research efforts have been conducted to merge the Internet of Things (IoT) with smart city environments. The goal to make a city “smart” is arising as a possible solution to lessen the issues caused by the urban population growth and fast urbanization. Attention also has focused on the pedestrian crossings because they are one of the most dangerous places in the transport field. Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) can undoubtedly be an excellent support in developing infrastructures that can best manage pedestrian crossing. For this reason, this paper introduces a fuzzy logic-based solution able to manage dynamically the traffic lights’ phases in signalized pedestrian crossings. The proposed approach provides the possibility to change the phases of the traffic light taking into account the time of the day and the number of pedestrians about to cross the road. The paper presents a thorough description of the fuzzy logic controller configuration, an in-depth analysis of the application scenario and simulative assessments obtained through Vissim simulations.	alessandro vespignani;crossing number (graph theory);fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;internet of things;simulation;smart city;tree accumulation;vissim	Giovanni Pau;Tiziana Campisi;Antonino Canale;Alessandro Severino;Mario Collotta;Giovanni Tesoriere	2018	Future Internet	10.3390/fi10020015	pedestrian crossing;simulation;vissim;control theory;smart city;computer network;computer science;fuzzy logic;pedestrian;intelligent transportation system;information and communications technology	AI	-11.128739563468388	-23.762006446200022	105358

Additionally, the analysis should often be performed under stringent time requirements. This study identifies the information requirements for representing the damage information and performing the visual damage assessment of structural walls. The damage descriptions for seven common damage modes of structural walls were studied by employing the affinity diagramming method. The study showed that the information required to represent the damaged conditions can be grouped under five broad categories and using seventeen damage parameters. A sensitivity analysis showed that the damage parameters have varying degrees of importance. The results of the study can be used to develop formal representation of damage information in information models and potentially allow better allocation of data collection time in the field.	requirement	Engin Burak Anil;Burcu Akinci;James H.

e349a293c1a4a796c70fa119f2fa50bbd451f284	a fully hydrodynamic urban flood modelling system representing buildings, green space and interventions		Abstract City Catchment Analysis Tool – CityCAT-is a novel software system for rapid assessment of combined pluvial and fluvial flood risk using a unique combination of: efficient software architecture throughout and especially in the numerical part; use of standard, readily available data sets; efficient algorithms for grid generation; and robust and accurate solutions of the flow equations. It is based on advanced software architecture and accurate solutions for complex free-surface flow over the terrain distinguishing between permeable and impermeable surfaces and taking into account effects of man-made features such as buildings as obstacles to flow. The software is firstly rigorously validated with demanding test cases based on analytical solutions and laboratory studies. Then the unique capability for assessment of the effectiveness of specific flood alleviation interventions across large urban domains, such as roof storage on buildings or introduction of permeable surfaces, is demonstrated.

655bab25dc35dadf83b7bd500af00b1307363f39	an adaptive approach for decision making tactics in automated negotiation	negotiation tactics;artificial intelligence;agent based automated negotiation;negotiation	In this paper, an adaptive decision making approach of three families of tactics has been proposed for bilateral negotiation: the time dependent tactics, behavior dependent tactics, and time independent tactics. These tactics are more adaptive to the environment’s changes (reservation interval, time deadline, opponent behavior). The suggested time dependent tactics take advantage from round based time continuity and dynamics aspects (features) integrated in their modelling. For suggested behavior dependent tactics, a new formalization based on the percentage of change was introduced, which helps agents to be more prudent in the environments with incomplete information comparing to previous behavior dependent tactics suggested by Faratin et al. (Int. J. Robotics Auton. Syst. 24(3–4):159–182, 1998). Concerning the new family of tactics which are completely independent from time, the agents compute their offers based on their reservation interval. These tactics are useful when there is no time deadline and, in addition, when the behavior of opponent agents doesn’t follow any negotiation equilibrium. Moreover, new experimental measures are suggested which are more useful for final evaluation. The experiments conducted in this paper, prove the applicability of all three families of tactic.	auton;bilateral filter;experiment;robotics;scott continuity	Arash Bahrammirzaee;Amine Chohra;Kurosh Madani	2013	Applied Intelligence	10.1007/s10489-013-0434-8	artificial intelligence;negotiation	AI	-10.113545961025773	-10.09897525748844	105895

For behavioral networks with Watts-Strogatz small-world topology covering a broad range from highly clustered nearest-neighbor graphs to random graphs, we demonstrate the existence of S-shape phase transition curves relating diversity of behaviors to the mutation rate. This curve suggests the emergence of four key phases of behavior in the society ranging from one or a few dominant behaviors to collapse (or lack of dominance). Preliminary stability analysis and characterization of properties of equilibria are provided that suggest the proposed social choice model is plausible."""	bandwagon effect;choice modelling;emergence;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;models of dna evolution;mutator method;network formation;norm (social);random graph;semantic network;social network;watts humphrey	Reza Olfati-Saber	2007	2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2007.4435009	social dynamics;behavioural sciences;artificial intelligence;graph theory;machine learning;mathematics;small-world network;social network;evolutionary computation	ECom	-14.819530312436806	-17.013337227483568	105979

This eProcurement planning research describes a framework for the integration of a knowledge-based system capable of identifying a goal model from a Primitive Model. The Primitive Model is screened by the screening factors reflecting the purchase strategy. As a result, by using the framework for supplier selection and allocation (SSA), a purchaser is able to reduce the costs and time required to select the right suppliers and to alleviate anxiety for ‘out-of-favor’ suppliers. This approach is based on two-phased semantic optimization model modification that semantically builds a goal model through model identification and candidate supplier screening based on model identification rules and supplier screening rules. This approach contributes significantly to construction of an optimization model from the perspective of model management and it provides a useful environment for efficient eProcurement from the perspective of a purchaser. q 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

One model, the social influence model, reproduced the choices that participants took by modeling both the cognitive processes the participant engaged in and the social influences that the participant saw. The second model, the pure cognitive model, used only cognitive capabilities and did not model any social influences that the participant saw. Somewhat surprisingly, the two models showed no difference in quality of fit (the pure cognitive model actually fit slightly better than the social influence model), suggesting that social influence models should take cognitive functions into account in their theories.	cognition;cognitive model;theory;watts humphrey	J.

Evolutionary game theory has been adopted to model the evolution of successive generations of agents playing a social dilemma game. In evolutionary simulations of N-player social dilemmas, cooperation rarely emerges. This paper investigates cultural evolution (via norms that are recorded as artefacts) as a means to increase the fitness of the society by allowing individual strategies to base their actions, not just on their genetic material, but also to take into consideration (by learning) evidence recorded as artefacts. In the first set of experiments, these norms are propagated vertically and we show that allowing cultural learning for a set of strategies in a small population can result in a stable and cooperative society. In the second set of preliminary experiments, agents are organised spatially according to a random graph and norms are spread horizontally.	prisoner's dilemma	Colm O'Riordan;Josephine Griffith;Dara Curran;Humphrey Sorensen	2006		10.1109/CEC.2006.1688433	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;multi-agent system;mathematics;management science;social dilemma	ML	-15.800997742179304	-14.553197498620962	106767

The goal is to select a predictive reference trajectory among a set of candidate ones, issued from a trajectory generator. This selection aims at optimizing multi-criteria functions, such as safety, legal rules, preferences and comfort of passengers, or energy consumption. This work introduces a new framework for Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). The proposed approach adopts fuzzy logic theory to deal with heterogeneous criteria and arbitrary functions. Moreover, the consideration of uncertain vehicle's sensors data is done using the Dempster-Shafer Theory with fuzzy sets in order to provide a risk assessment. Simulation results using datasets collected under the NGSIM program are presented on car following cases, and extended to lane changing situations.	autonomous robot;defuzzification;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rule;fuzzy set;high- and low-level;risk assessment;scalability;sensor;simulation;theory (mathematical logic);trust (emotion);uncertain data	Laurene Claussmann;Marie O'Brien;Sebastien Glaser;Homayoun Najjaran;Dominique Gruyer	2018	2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	10.1109/IVS.2018.8500451	multiple-criteria decision analysis;dempster–shafer theory;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;machine learning;risk assessment;artificial intelligence;computer science	Robotics	-5.389303069515357	-21.073801426085826	107016

Therefore, the benefits distribution of fourth party logistics among its third party logistics is one of the critical issues. A Nash equilibrium model of fourth party logistics based on nonprofit organization is proposed and the game theory is adopted to analyses the distribution relationship among third party logistics. A utility function is constructed to evaluate the effectiveness of third-party logistics providers, and distribution factor is gotten using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Finally an example of Wuhan logistics market is taken to prove the validity of the proposed model. This distribution scheme takes into account the distribution of individual rational and collective rational principle, and it is valid in benefits distribution of fourth party logistics based on nonprofit organization.	logistics	Qiong Liu;Tingting Li	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-88518-4_57	game theory;analytic hierarchy process;nash equilibrium	AI	-6.247720931196512	-10.87544388295647	107571

The mapping problem is a well-studied one, however usage of multiple agents and operation in a non-static environment complicate it and present a handful of challenges (e.g. double-counting, robust data association, memory and bandwidth limits). All these problems are interrelated, but are very rarely considered together, despite the fact that each has drawn attention of the researches.

Decision-making methodologies have been extensively researched, and some of the published research deals with decision making within the context of everyday life. However, in many organizations it is customary for decisions to be made under pressure and in conditions of uncertainty. Such organizations may benefit from a generic decision-making approach. Two case studies were used to research the characteristics of time-critical decision making. A qualitative analysis of these case studies and previous research insights were integrated. The insights that were found enable us to offer a practical generic approach toward improving the process of time-critical decision making. The suggested approach combines components that were mentioned in previous research with new ones. It contains two phases: The first identifies various decision-making situations in the organization and their classification according to the extent (severity) of time criticality in making and implementing the decision. This classification determines the necessary decision making and implementation procedures, whether they are cognitive or not. The second deals with the relevant components for improving the quality of the decision making. Application of this approach is very simple, and it suits not only military organizations, but also organizations and individuals that will benefit from making better decisions in stressful situations. The approach can be combined with other existing approaches such as risk management.	cognition;real-time computing;risk management;self-organized criticality;window of opportunity	Izack Cohen	2008	Decision Analysis	10.1287/deca.1080.0111	r-cast;optimal decision;economics;decision analysis;decision field theory;decision engineering;knowledge management;decision tree;decision rule;naturalistic decision-making;management science;mathematical economics;evidential reasoning approach;business decision mapping	Web+IR	-9.920999552288539	-14.785591697791968	107876

Multiple methodologies for performing the evaluation are available, however, they are based mainly on survey data. In our previous research, we introduced perceptual measurements from eye tracker (ET) to the set of evaluation criteria. In this paper, we present an approach based on AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) to allow a thorough analysis of the complex structure of criteria and its impact on the final evaluation. Additionally, we combine the AHP outputs with the COMET (Characteristic Objects METhod) technique to build a fuzzy rule base that provides a stable model of the entire domain of evaluation criteria. The results of the conducted empirical verification of the proposed approach are presented and discussed. The main research findings show that the rankings obtained with the presented approach are very stable and the probability of a rank reversal phenomenon is low.	common criteria	Jaroslaw Watrobski;Artur Karczmarczyk;Jaroslaw Jankowski;Pawel Ziemba;Waldemar Wolski	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-77721-4_13	empirical research;data mining;user experience design;survey data collection;analytic hierarchy process;rank reversals in decision-making;fuzzy rule;usability;computer science;phenomenon	NLP	-5.914280477412928	-15.60989112588366	108157

One such is the Idiotypic Network (IN) proposed by Jerne, wherein the antibodies form a virtual network based on both antigenic and mutual stimulations and suppressions which in turn change their respective concentrations. This paper portrays how INs can be augmented with information sharing and used within a Multi-Robot System (MRS), to learn the right behaviours and actions to achieve a goal inherent to an environment. Each robot in the MRS scenario is equipped with its own IN that shares the information learned from the environment with that of its peers. We also present a case when the environment changes during run-time and the MRS re-learns by making re-adjustments in the concentrations of a new set of antibodies. The results obtained from a real scenario comprising three robots using an IN each, portrayed herein, justify the viability of such an approach.	algorithm;experiment;minimal recursion semantics;mobile agent;rechargeable battery;robot;robotics;run time (program lifecycle phase);semantic network;swarm	S.

People in the communities face limitations or conditions which have effects on their decisions. In this paper, we present a multigenerational social learning model to analyse a world with some limitations. Then we turn the world to a free world and people try to find correct decisions utilizing these changes. In the presented model, people make their initial decisions based on sequential decision model which leads them into the herd behavior. Then we change the world so that making connections with other communities is possible. We show how aggregate welfare will be improved when people use their observations, their new obtained information on social ties and their personality factors to review their current decisions. We also have a parameter in our model that examines the effect of personality factor value on the percentage of the correct decision among the communities. Our main results show when people use their obtained information rather than sticking to the herd behavior, the aggregate welfare will be better in the world, even if people use only their own observations.	aggregate data;information cascade;the herd with colin cowherd	Marziyeh Barghandan;Mohammad Malekzadeh;Atefeh Safdel;Iren Mazloomzadeh	2014	2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2014)	10.1109/ASONAM.2014.6921637	games;social science;decision field theory;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;management science;sociology;social psychology;statistics;business decision mapping	HCI	-15.857241849578676	-15.519106945072307	108511

When agents self-determine options from which they choose, for instance, their resource consumption and production, while these choices have a collective systemwide impact, optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known as NP-hard. In such challenging computational problems, centrally managed (deep) learning systems often require personal data with implications on privacy and citizens’ autonomy. This article envisions an alternative unsupervised and decentralized collective learning approach that preserves privacy, autonomy, and participation of multi-agent systems self-organized into a hierarchical tree structure. Remote interactions orchestrate a highly efficient process for decentralized collective learning. This disruptive concept is realized by I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections, accompanied by a paradigmatic software artifact. Strikingly, I-EPOS outperforms related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange full information. This article contributes new experimental findings about the influence of network topology and planning on learning efficiency as well as findings on techno-socio-economic tradeoffs and global optimality. Experimental evaluation with real-world data from energy and bike sharing pilots demonstrates the grand potential of collective learning to design ethically and socially responsible participatory sharing economies.

Boolean network models (BN) help to explain the role played by peer interactions in the emergence of consensus. BN models represent a society as a network in which individuals are the nodes (with two states, e.g. agree/disagree) and social relationships are the edges. BN models highlight the influence of peer interactions on social cooperation, in contrast to models, such as prisoner's dilemma, that focus on individual strategies. In BN models, the behavior that emerges from peer interactions differs in subtle, but important ways from equivalent mathematical models (e.g. Markov, dynamic systems). Despite their simplicity, BN models provide potentially important insights about many social issues. They confirm that there is an upper limit to the size of groups within which peer interactions can create and maintain consensus. In large social groups, a combination of peer interaction and enforcement is needed to achieve consensus. Social consensus is brittle in the face of global influences, such as mass media, with the peer network at first impeding the spread of alternative views, then accelerating them once a critical point is passed. BN models are sensitive both to the network topology, and to the degrees of influence associated with peer-peer connections	boolean network;consensus (computer science);critical point (network science);dynamical system;emergence;interaction;markov chain;mathematical model;network topology;prisoner's dilemma;social collaboration	David G.

This paper provides an overview of this topic by contrasting ways of assessing the validity of effect and causal indicators in structural equation models (SEMs). It also draws a distinction between composite (formative) indicators and causal indicators and argues that validity is most relevant to the latter. Sound validity assessment of indicators is dependent on having an adequate overall model fit and on the relative stability of the parameter estimates for the latent variable and indicators as they appear in different models. If the overall fit and stability of estimates are adequate, then a researcher can assess validity using the unstandardized and standardized validity coefficients and the unique validity variance estimate. With multiple causal indicators or with effect indicators influenced by multiple latent variables, collinearity diagnostics are useful. These results are illustrated with a number of correctly and incorrectly specified hypothetical models.	causal filter;causality;coefficient;composite video;latent variable;structural equation modeling	Kenneth A.

d825ac58d9358c27d40839f793af9b50bc549c36	aspiration-based reinforcement learning in repeated interaction games: an overview		In models of aspiration-based reinforcement learning, agents adapt by comparing payoffs achieved from actions chosen in the past with an aspiration level. Though such models are well-established in behavioural psychology, only recently have they begun to receive attention in game theory and its applications to economics and politics. This paper provides an informal overview of a range of such theories applied to repeated interaction games. We describe different models of aspiration formation: where (1) aspirations are fixed but required to be consistent with longrun average payoffs; (2) aspirations evolve based on past personal experience or of previous generations of players; and (3) aspirations are based on the experience of peers. Convergence to non-Nash outcomes may result in either of these formulations. Indeed, cooperative behaviour can emerge and survive in the long run, even though it may be a strictly dominated strategy in the stage game, and despite the myopic adaptation of stage game strategies. Differences between reinforcement learning and evolutionary game theory are also discussed.	game theory;longrun;nash equilibrium;reinforcement learning	Jonathan Bendor;Dilip Mookherjee;Debraj Ray	2001	IGTR	10.1142/S0219198901000348	non-cooperative game;repeated game;mathematical economics	ML	-14.72981108585358	-13.515704848011273	109034

This paper presents a Knowledge engineering application whereby a Fuzzy Network (FN) is used to build a complex computing model to reproduce corporate dynamics and to implement a Model Reference Adaptive Control (MARC) strategy for Corporate Control [2]. This model is used as a What If? Environment to explore future consequences of actions planned within a strategic scenario context in terms of KPIs displayed in a Balanced ScoreCard (BSC) control board. Corporation’s strategy map is required to plan the Knowledge Identification and Capture Activity (KICA) required to obtain the knowledge to be represented in the FN’s nodes rule bases. KICA produces linguistic variables as well as the qualitative relationships amongst them. A FN appears as a natural solution to model the knowledge distributed within the members participating in all analysis and decision making tasks along the organization. Additionally, as proof of concept a prototype which capable of designing and simulating networks of fuzzy systems is presented based on the standard IEC 61131-7.

In order to improve upon the flexible production lines, rapid assessment tools have to be developed and implemented. Since uncertain information and incomplete knowledge coexist inevitably in the rapid assessment process, in literature, fuzzy multi-attribute decision making models are established to handle them simultaneously. However, very few papers have paid adequate attention to the decision maker's rationality, i.e., the optimism level of the decision maker. Therefore, in this paper, a series of novel rational decision making models are developed in dealing with the multi-attribute assessment problems, which include incomplete preference information. And the evaluating data are expressed under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy settings. Compared with the traditional distance-based method, correlation coefficient between each alternative and the ideal solution with (@a, @b) optimism level is applied. Furthermore, confidence level and cognitive dissonance of the decision maker are included in the overall decision making process in order to constitute a more comprehensive evaluation of the flexible production line. Besides, several insights are revealed concerning the levels of optimism and the weights of production line attributes. Finally, a three-stage empirical study is conducted to validate the proposed models, compare them with the traditional distance-based methods, and the result shows that our approach is not only valid but also outperforms the traditional methods.

The answer to this question is of great importance to strategic decision makers in large scale interconnected network systems. Typical examples are the regional, national, continental and global networks found in the public utility sectors and network industries which provide, for example, energy, telecommunication and transportation services. The behaviour of such systems is determined by many actors including regulators, asset owners, operators, service providers and users. Each decision making entity is situated in a dynamic, multi-actor, multi-objective and multi-level jungle: it is part of a bigger system which is constantly changing, it has to cope with the actions of other actors who may have conflicting interests and values, and who operate on different levels of hierarchy. Which models could support such an actor to explore different scenarios and to learn about the possible consequences of different actions through simulations? Successful models should be able to capture both the physical and social reality of the system, their interactions with one another and the external dynamic environment, and they must allow users to experiment with changes in both the physical and the social network configuration. In other words, socio-technical systems pose a formidable challenge for modellers. Existing tools to deal with either the physical (e.g. models of industrial processes) or the social network (e.g. economic market models) are available, but these worlds have yet to be brought together in an integrated modelling approach for socio-technical systems. That is the ambition of this thesis. The additional challenge is to meet this objective not just for one specific domain, such as energy or industry, but to set up a modelling infrastructure that is able to deal with today’s reality of socio-technical network systems that are interconnected across domains. This thesis aims at contributing to an integrated framework for socio-technical systems to help modellers build better models and ultimately provide better decision support to actors involved in regulating, operating or otherwise using these systems. This thesis covers two different story lines, which will be addressed below. The first starts with an illustration of the problems and challenges in socio-technical systems and the need for a flexible bottom-up approach to modelling, resulting in a modelling framework that fulfils these criteria. The framework can then be applied to a number of case studies, with each subsequent case study contributing to the generic framework. For this purpose the agent-based paradigm turned out as most promising.

The development of land use change models is challenging, as there is a need to connect representations of human behavioural processes to simulations of the biophysical environment. This paper presents a new agent-based modelling framework (Aporia) that has the goal of reducing the complexity and difficulty of constructing high-fidelity land use models. Building on earlier conceptual developments for modelling land use change and the provision of ecosystem services, Aporia was designed to be modular, flexible and open, using a declarative, compositional approach to create complex models from subcomponents. The framework can be tightly or loosely coupled with multiple vegetation models, it can be set up to evaluate a range of ecosystem service indicators, and it can be calibrated for a range of different landscape-scale case studies and modelling styles. The framework is released under an Open Source licence, and can be freely re-used and modified to form the basis of new models. We illustrate this with two case studies implemented using Aporia, exploring different socio-economic scenarios and behavioural characteristics on the land use decisions of Swiss and Scottish farmers. We also discuss the benefits of frameworks in terms of their flexibility, expandability, verification and transparency. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

260dd9730710a8fc42d43d6d6e66062251aaf489	forming nested 3d structures based on the brazil nut effect	brazil nut effect	This study investigates the formation of nested structures in swarms of intelligent agents that can freely move in three dimensions. The underlying segregation mechanism is inspired by the Brazil nut effect, which occurs when granular mixtures are subjected to vibrations [6,1]. Similar effects were reported for brood items sorted by ants [3]. This sorting behaviour was validated with swarms of mobile robots [7,5]. Different from these studies we are concerned with sorting the agents themselves. In [4], we proposed a controller based on the Brazil nut effect that was capable of segregating groups of simulated e-puck robots reliably in two dimensions. In the present study, we investigate a 3D particle system implemented in NetLogo. The agents mimic the behaviour of particles of distinct sizes. The motion of each agent is determined by three types of vectors [4]: (i) a repulsion vector for every agent that intrudes the particle’s virtual body, (ii) a random vector simulating vibrations, (iii) and a “gravitational” vector that points to a “centre” location. The agents do not communicate. However, the repulsion behaviour requires them to sense each others’ relative positions within their particle range. The segregation quality is measured as the percentage of pairs of particles from different groups that are segregated correctly (based on distance to centre) [4]. A value of 100% corresponds to perfect structures with all large agents surrounding the small agents, 50% corresponds to purely random structures, whereas 0% corresponds to perfect but inverted structures. The structure formed by 2 groups of 50 agents was investigated for different particle size ratios [see Fig. 1(a)]. For ratio 1.00, all agents behave identical and hence no segregation occurred. For ratios near 0, structures achieved consistently a segregation quality of about 100%. The study was expanded to include a third group with results that matched the ones obtained with two groups [see Fig. 1(b)]. We observed the formation of asymmetric structures when using group specific centres of gravity [see Fig. 1(c)]. Video recordings are available in [2]. The formation of 3D structures could be useful in medical, military and space applications. Future work will have to investigate a physical implementation.	e-puck mobile robot;intelligent agent;netlogo;particle system;simulation;sorting;vector graphics;virtual body;xfig	Stephen Foster;Roderich Groß	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23232-9_44	control theory;discrete mathematics;particle;multivariate random variable;sorting;granular convection;mathematics;mobile robot;particle system;vibration	HCI	-14.27487240777681	-18.237213003209295	109441

Some basic theories of fuzzy mathematics are illustrated in this paper. In allusion to the present situation of tailing reservoir assessment, this method is tried to apply in safety comprehensive assessment of tailing reservoir. The safety assessment index system is established. A new method of calculating index weight is put forward: referring to entropy theory, an entropy model which can evaluate the quality of information given by evaluation specialists is established, to amend the index subjective weight given by specialists through analytic hierarchy process. The primary and comprehensive assessment is given in turn, the safety level is gained at last. A case study is given and the results shows, the method is scientific and effective.	analytical hierarchy;entropy (information theory);fuzzy mathematics;mud;theory	Chundi Si;Enli Chen;Peng Lv	2008	2008 Fifth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/FSKD.2008.412	computer science;data mining;statistics;entropy	SE	-7.70920325433771	-19.627988810841597	109485

At the same time, children would be affected by other languages, the influence of which is proportional to the population of those languages. In this paper, we revise the foregoing evolutionary theory of language, that is differential equations of the population dynamics. We propose that the transition rate in languages is sensitive to the distribution of population of each generation. In addition, we introduce the exposure probability that is the measure of influence from other languages. We show experimental results, in which we could observe the emergence of creole. Furthermore, we analysed which language would be dominant, dependent on the initial distribution of population, together with the exposure probability.	boundary case;creole (markup);emergence;evolution;jim christy;optic axis of a crystal;population dynamics;populous;stochastic matrix;xfig	Makoto Nakamura;Takashi Hashimoto;Satoshi Tojo	2003			language acquisition;transition rate matrix;natural language processing;creole language;differential equation;artificial intelligence;population;creolization;computer science	AI	-16.164953003849973	-17.422458416587627	109503

First, a simple probabilistic model for the estimation of the damage due to tunnel construction failures (e.g. cave-in collapses) is proposed. It can be used in conjunction with a deterministic estimate of the construction time/costs as a support for decision-making in tunnel construction projects. The occurrence of failures is modelled as an inhomogeneous Poisson process. The model takes into account the heterogeneity of the environment along the tunnel (changing geological conditions, changing damage potential) and it includes the influence of common factors such as human and organisational aspects. The damages caused by the failures are modelled as uncertain and they are thus represented by full probability distributions in the model. Second, the decision-making under uncertainty in construction projects is discussed. The use of the concept of utility for considering the attitude of the stakeholder to risk is demonstrated. The simple probabilistic model and the decision-making concept are applied to a case study of construction of a 480-m-long tunnel. Third, stochastic models for specific problems of tunnel construction, such as impacts of excavation on surface structures or probabilistic prediction of thickness of rock overburden, are introduced. The use of the models is illustrated on an example from Blanka tunnel in Prague.	risk assessment	Olga Spacková;Eva Novotná;Michal Sejnoha;Jirí Sejnoha	2013	Advances in Engineering Software	10.1016/j.advengsoft.2013.04.002	structural engineering;risk assessment;engineering;human factors and ergonomics;civil engineering;failure rate;quantum tunnelling;forensic engineering;utility	SE	-9.646243050398269	-17.292343454494958	110309

But in some situations, they behave very much alike. When it comes to many social and political questions, individuals' complex attitudes and beliefs must be boiled down to a simple yea (“spin up”) or nay (“spin down”). Although human societies, like physical materials, are very complex, some of their properties can be determined by understanding the interactions that occur between individuals (“atoms”). In particular, the spread of a particular political opinion throughout a society can be modeled as the macroscopic manifestation of the myriad exchanges occurring at the local level between individuals and their neighbors. This model can in future studies be used to gain a qualitative foothold on the evolution of public opinion in various countries for or against the government.	futures studies;interaction	Jonathan David Farley;George Markowsky	2011	Proceedings of the 6th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems	10.1109/IDAACS.2011.6072876	phase transition;cellular automaton;ising model;computer science;turing machine;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematical model;data mining;mathematics;management science;evolutionary dynamics;computational model;revolution	Robotics	-15.706449994641646	-16.60638263128204	110359

They can process a variety of products in the same system and thus helps to achieve higher productivity. At the same time the components in FMC are more prone to failure because of their high operating rate. Further, it becomes more complex when components follow different failure distributions and it is difficult to plan suitable maintenance interventions. To this effect, in the present paper the authors present a hybrid framework by contemporaneous adoption of qualitative and quantitative techniques to model and analyze the failure aspects in FMC. On qualitative part potential failure modes w.r.t. various robot components are identified and risk priority number is obtained using failure mode and effect analysis. On quantitative analysis, use of Generalized Stochastic Petri Net is made and simulation experiments were carried out to model and analyze the performance of FMC (3 Machines 1 Robot). Cases of both reliable and unreliable FMC are investigated.	flight management system;throughput	Ashok Kumar Gaula;Rajiv Kumar Sharma	2015	Int. J.

From the dataset, we analyze the dynamics of this connected social influence systems in decision making processes. We discover that generally social trades outperform individual trades, but the social reputation of the top traders is not completely determined by their performance due to social feedback even when users are betting their own money.

a0e935d9d4eaf6e08c0c88ee5e756b67b39202f4	gaining consensus in a moderated group: a model with a twofold feedback mechanism		The group Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is an effective tool to collect experts’ wisdom to evaluate complex decision making problems. Because judgments are always diverse in the real world, it is crucial to adequately support the consensus reaching process. In this paper, we develop a convergent group AHP consensus reaching model with a twofold feedback mechanism, which consists of both a judgment and a weighting feedback mechanism. In each round of this dynamic and interactive model, the most incompatible expert is asked to revise her judgment according to the judgment feedback mechanism. If the expert rejects the suggestion, her weight of importance will be adjusted downward based on the compatibility within the group by the weighting feedback mechanism. The proof of convergence of this consensus reaching model with the twofold mechanism is also provided and discussed. Hence this proposed consensus reaching process supports the leader or client in reaching a successful decision with a dispersed group of experts. The proposed consensus reaching model is applied to the brake pad supplier selection problem of Chery Automobile Co., Ltd. The empirical example demonstrates that the proposed methodology provides an operational decision framework for companies to select suitable suppliers in the supplier involvement under the environment of collaborative product development (SICPD) through its successful application in that context © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

b9f74234c8156cd33b5ef509d4ffa4a5db8abc1e	the value-analytic hierarchy process: a lean multi criteria decision support method		Abstract   The Analytic Hierarchy Process uses pairwise comparison in order to define priorities for criteria and for alternatives, obtaining an overall ranking which represents a “rational decision”.  In literature there are many examples of AHP applications where, in order to operate the ranking of alternatives according to qualitative and quantitative criteria, authors assign an utility value to the judgments on qualitative criteria but also to the values assumed on the basis of quantitative criteria.  A modified approach, that was called Value-Analytic Hierarchy Process (V-AHP), was developed as a combination of traditional AHP rating on qualitative criteria and a “lean” rating on quantitative criteria. Such procedure allows to limit the use of the traditional AHP method only to criteria expressed by qualitative judgments and/or by scales different from ratio ones. A numerical example was carried out, according to the introduced methodology, in order to rank 15 potential simulated industrial investments evaluated by qualitative and quantitative criteria. The V-AHP can be defined a “lean” Multi Criteria Decision Support Method potentially applicable to any multi-criteria decision-making context.		Lucio Compagno;Natalia Trapani;Diego D'Urso;Antonio G.

Generally, in those studies, urban areas, where the human activ- ities are concentrated, focuses major attention. Main concerns are about the exist- ing building stock, mostly composed by structures not compliant with modern seismic design criteria. The production of a seismic risk map is a complex task that involves the combination of data coming from different field of expertise. The aim of the study is to show how the already available information can be combined together in a Geographical Information System (GIS) tool. The results provide a reliable representation of the seismic risk at urban scale to be used when planning the mitigation measures to be undertaken in order to improve the level of preparedness in case of an earthquake. The analysis has been applied for demon- stration purposes to the town of Cassino, Central Italy.

Agents repeatedly communicate with their neighbors in the social network, can exert effort to manipulate the trust of others, and update their opinions about some common issue by taking weighted averages of neighbors’ opinions. The incentives to manipulate are given by the agents’ preferences. We show that manipulation can modify the trust structure and lead to a connected society. Manipulation fosters opinion leadership, but the manipulated agent may even gain influence on the long-run opinions. Finally, we investigate the tension between information aggregation and spread of misinformation.	open road tolling;social network	Manuel Förster;Ana Mauleon;Vincent Vannetelbosch	2016	Network Science	10.1017/nws.2015.34	public relations;knowledge management;political science;social psychology	AI	-16.370448688312194	-14.558378518400659	112001

5b73127d85e54832847e93da1292dd26f3bb1598	solving reviewer assignment problem in software peer review: an approach based on preference matrix and asymmetric tsp model		Optimized reviewer assignment can effectively utilize limited intellectual resources and significantly assure review quality in various scenarios such as paper selection in conference or journal, proposal selection in funding agencies and so on. However, little research on reviewer assignment of software peer review has been found. In this study, an optimization approach is proposed based on students' preference matrix and the model of asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP). Due to the most critical role of rule matrix in this approach, we conduct a questionnaire to obtain students' preference matrixes and convert them to rule matrixes. With the help of software ILOG CPLEX, the approach is accomplished by controlling the exit criterion of ATSP model. The comparative study shows that the assignment strategies with both reviewers' preference matrix and authors' preference matrix get better performance than the random assignment. Especially, it is found that the performance is just a little better than that of random assignment when the reviewers' and authors' preference matrixes are merged. In other words, the majority of students have a strong wish of harmonious development even though high-level students are not willing to do that.	assignment problem;augmented assignment;cplex;high- and low-level;ilog;management science;mathematical optimization;operations research;peer-to-peer;rapid refresh;software peer review;travelling salesman problem;word lists by frequency	Yanqing Wang;Yu Jiang;Xiaolei Wang;Siyu Zhang;Yaowen Liang	2014	CoRR		computer science;artificial intelligence;operations management;operations research	AI	-8.297474208903184	-12.201745459068375	112360

An aggregated systemic importance index is calculated based on expert knowledge by using a fuzzy logic inference system. We use principal component analysis to calculate a benchmark index for comparison purposes. Overall similarities between both indexes put forward that expert knowledge aggregation is consistent with that based on a purely quantitative standard approach. Specific non-negligible differences concur with the nonlinear features of an approach whose intention is to replicate human reasoning. Both indexes are complementary and provide a comprehensive relative assessment of each financial institution's systemic importance in the Colombian case, in which the choice of metrics pursues the macroprudential perspective of financial stability.

443c4222e74cf2d6b61ced6fa8993c552a14046b	unveiling political opinion structures with a web-experiment		The dynamics of political votes has been widely studied, both for its practical interest and as a paradigm of the dynamics of mass opinions and collective phenomena, where theoretical predictions can be easily tested. However, the vote outcome is often influenced by many factors beyond the bare opinion on the candidate, and in most cases it is bound to a single preference. The voter perception of the political space is still to be elucidated. We here propose a web experiment (laPENSOcosı̀) where we explicitly investigate participants’ opinions on political entities (parties, coalitions, individual candidates) of the Italian political scene. As a main result, we show that the political perception follows a Weber-Fechner-like law, i.e., when ranking political entities according to the user expressed preferences, the perceived distance of the user from a given entity scales as the logarithm of this rank.	bottom-up proteomics;computation;dynamical system;entity;experiment;like button;passenger name record;programming paradigm;time complexity;top-down and bottom-up design;unfolding (dsp implementation);universality probability;web application	Pietro Gravino;Saverio Caminiti;Alina Sîrbu;Francesca Tria;Vito Domenico Pietro Servedio;Vittorio Loreto	2016		10.5220/0005906300390047	public relations;political science	NLP	-16.308637398327313	-16.167486710491097	112560

The objective weight calculating model was established based on the principle and using merely the assessment data itself. The subjective weight of each index was calculated by using analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The subjective weight was combined with the objective weight and thus the synthetic weight of each index was confirmed. Then the disciplinary construction assessment model based on synthetic weight and TOPSIS was built. An example is shown to highlight the procedure of the proposed model. The results of the example show that the proposed model is effective for the disciplinary construction assessment of teaching-oriented universities.	analytical hierarchy;coefficient;fuzzy concept;synthetic intelligence;weight function	Guofeng Wen;Guangcheng Wang	2011	2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation	10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022402	systems engineering;engineering;operations management;management science	Robotics	-7.672245146139462	-19.224760459721228	112667

The scenario-based approach allows the decision maker to think deterministically about the problem by attaching causal links to a small number of potential outcomes, instead of using probability distributions. The scenario approach can be expressed as a simplified version of the comprehensive but practically complex “distributive” outranking method of d’Avignon and Vincke. Using a scenario approach has distinct practical advantages, but also presents the inherent danger that meaningful information is ignored. The extent of this danger is assessed using a simulation experiment, where it is found to be of a magnitude that is non-trivial but still potentially acceptable for certain decision contexts.	causal filter;deterministic algorithm;experiment;scenario optimization;simulation	Ian N.

Wiginton, H. T. Nguyen, J.M. Pearce Abstract Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has matured to become a technically viable largescale source of sustainable energy. Understanding the rooftop PV potential is critical for utility planning, accommodating grid capacity, deploying financing schemes and formulating future adaptive energy policies. This paper demonstrates techniques to merge the capabilities of geographic information systems and object-specific image recognition to determine the available rooftop area for PV deployment in an example large-scale region in south eastern Ontario. A five-step procedure has been developed for estimating total rooftop PV potential which involves geographical division of the region; sampling using the Feature Analyst extraction software; extrapolation using roof areapopulation relationships; reduction for shading, other uses and orientation; and conversion to power and energy outputs. Limitations faced in terms of the capabilities of the software and determining the appropriate fraction of roof area available are discussed. Because this aspect of the analysis uses an integral approach, PV potential will not be georeferenced, but rather presented as an agglomerate value for use in regional policy making. A relationship across the region was found between total roof area and population of 70.0 m/capita ± 6.2%. With appropriate roof tops covered with commercial solar cells, the potential PV peak power output from the region considered is 5.74 GW (157% of the region’s peak power demands) and the potential annual energy production is 6909 GWh (5% of Ontario’s total annual demand). This suggests that 30% of Ontario’s energy demand can be met with province-wide rooftop PV deployment. This new understanding of roof area distribution and potential PV outputs will guide energy policy formulation in Ontario and will inform future research in solar PV deployment and its geographical potential.	algorithm;computer vision;extrapolation;feature analyst;feature extraction;gw-basic;geographic information system;page view;population;sampling (signal processing);shading;software deployment;solar cell;typset and runoff	L.

51d155a20ea9c42ecb8343352627e82c742657ff	stability of evolving agent populations		Stability is perhaps the most desired feature in the systems that we design. It is important for us to be able to predict the response of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to various environmental conditions prior to its actual deployment. The Chli-DeWilde agent stability measure views a MAS as a discrete time Markov chain with a potentially unknown transition probabilities. A MAS is considered to be stable when its state, a stochastic process, has converged to an equilibrium distribution. We investigate an extension of their agent stability definition to include MASs with evolutionary dynamics, focusing on evolving agent populations. Additionally, using our extended agent stability measure, we construct an entropy-based definition for the degree of instability. An example system, the Digital Ecosystem, is considered in detail to investigate the stability of an evolving agent population through simulations. The results are consistent with the original Chli-DeWilde measure.	digital ecosystem;ecosystem model;entropy (information theory);evolutionary algorithm;instability;markov chain;multi-agent system;population;simulation;software deployment;stochastic process	Gerard Briscoe;Philippe De Wilde	2007	CoRR		discrete time and continuous time;mathematical optimization;software deployment;digital ecosystem;evolutionary dynamics;population;instability;stochastic process;markov chain;computer science	AI	-17.709125695067627	-15.64298520644239	113022

The framework provides an overarching design that can be extended into specific model implementations to evaluate how policy, land-management preferences, and land-market dynamics affect (and are affected by) land-use and land-cover change patterns and subsequent carbon storage and flux. To demonstrate the framework, we implement a simple integration of a new agent-based model of exurban residential development and land-management decisions with the ecosystem process model BIOME-BGC. Using a stylized scenario, we evaluate the influence of different exurban residential-land-management strategies on carbon storage at the parcel level over a 48-year period from 1958 to 2005, simulating stocks of carbon in soil, litter, vegetation, and net primary productivity. Results show 1) residential parcels with management practices that only provided additions in the form of fertilizer and irrigation to turfgrass stored slightly more carbon than parcels that did not include management practices, 2) conducting no land-management strategy stored more carbon than implementing a strategy that included removals in the form of removing coarse woody debris from dense tree cover and litter from turfgrass, and 3) the removal practices modelled had a larger impact on total parcel carbon storage than our modelled additions. The degree of variation within the evaluated land-management practices was approximately 42,104 kg C storage on a 1.62 ha plot after 48 years, demonstrating the substantial effect that residential land-management practices can have on carbon storage. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

705de7ec168562f25189b4764530a6c72b47d4cd	allocating a fixed cost based on a dea-game cross efficiency approach		Abstract In many real managerial applications, an issue of considerable importance is allocating a total fixed cost across a set of competing decision making units (DMUs). The fixed cost allocation problem has also become one of the most important applications of the data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology. In this paper, we will approach the fixed cost allocation problem by explicitly considering both competition and cooperation relationships among DMUs. To this end, we integrate cooperative game theory and the cross efficiency method to develop a DEA-game cross efficiency approach to generate a unique and fair allocation plan. With the proposed approach, each DMU is considered as a player and a super-additive characteristic function is defined for coalitions of DMUs. Then, the Shapley value is calculated for each DMU and accordingly associated common weights are optimized to determine the final allocation plan. Since the cross efficiency method considers peer appraisal and the cooperative game theory allows for equitable negotiations, all DMUs are supposed to reach a consensus on the equitable allocation scheme through our novel approach. From this perspective, our proposed approach is promising and attractive for allocating a fixed cost in large organizations. Finally, the DEA-game cross efficiency approach is demonstrated with a numerical example derived from previous literature and the results are compared to some existing methods. Additionally, we apply the proposed approach to an empirical application concerning city commercial bank activities in China.		Feng Li;Qingyuan Zhu;Liang Liang	2018	Expert Syst.

We show that the measures are useful to identify and characterize different dynamical phases. It becomes clear that different operation regimes are required for different traffic demands. Thus, not only is traffic a non-stationary problem, requiring controllers to adapt constantly; controllers must also change drastically the complexity of their behavior depending on the demand. Based on our measures and extending Ashby’s law of requisite variety, we can say that the self-organizing method achieves an adaptability level comparable to that of a living system.

We specifically focus on a method of operator error detection by a software manmachine interface that constitutes an important part of the implementation of operator error tolerance. This method is based on the recognition and the verification of plans executed by the operator during his interactions with the technical system. The main phases of operator error detection are examined. The proposed method of operator error detection is then applied to an air traffic control system, called CAUTRA.	error detection and correction	Jin Mo;Yves Crouzet	1999		10.1007/3-540-48249-0_12	reliability engineering;complex systems;simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;air traffic control	AI	-10.961603922168067	-14.98309988655397	114388

Parking facility service evaluations play an important role in urban transportation planning and operation. This paper introduces a level of service (LOS) concept based on a comprehensive parking study in Beijing, China. The LOS methodology developed by an integrated evaluation model reflects the user's perception of the quality of service. The method combines four important service variables, namely the ratio of peak-hour demand to capacity, average parking space occupying rate, parking cost, and circulation time, into one single index to quantitatively evaluate a parking facility's performance.	quality of service;single-index model	Yulong He;Xiaoduan Sun;Lizhen Du;Ruan Jinmei;Subasish Das	2012	2012 15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/ITSC.2012.6338914	simulation;operations management;parking guidance and information;transport engineering;business	Robotics	-10.011960396387723	-20.469552823977374	115056

The fuzzy constraint-directed approach involves the fuzzy probability constraint and the fuzzy instance reasoning. The proposed approach via fuzzy probability constraint can not only cluster the opponent’s information in negotiation process as proximate regularities to improve the convergence of behavior patterns, but also eliminate the noisy hypotheses or beliefs to enhance the effectiveness on beliefs learning. By using fuzzy instance method, our approach can reuse the prior opponent knowledge to speed up the problem-solving, and reason the proximate regularities to acquire desirable results on predicting opponent behavior. In addition, the proposed interaction method enables the agent to make a concession dynamically based on expected objectives. Moreover, experimental results suggest that the proposed framework allows an agent to achieve a higher reward, a fairer deal, or a smaller cost of negotiation.	autonomous robot;cognition;experiment;heuristic;iteration;message passing;method (computer programming);problem solving	K.

This is especially suitable for natural physical systems, e.g . in ecology . The model is divided into a static and a dynamic part . The static model describes the distribution of each parameter as a qualitative physical field . Composite fields are constructed from intersection models of pairs of fields . The dynamic model describes processes acting on the fields, and qualitative relationships between parameters .

However, the conventional methodology of CIs development causes indiscrimination, relative calibration, and redundancy. To address these problems, we propose a novel methodology that uses fuzzy theories. The proposed methodology includes a utility function for normalizing, a fuzzy measure for weighting, and a fuzzy integral for aggregating. We conducted a case study to assess the quality of the proposed methodology versus the alternative methodologies on 25 real projects of a construction company. The result showed that the measurement reliability of the proposed normalization method (1.96) is greater than that of the two different normalization methods (10.44 and 2.8, respectively). In addition, the measurement accuracy of the proposed aggregation method is greater than those of the four different aggregation methods. Therefore, our proposed methodology can more consistently and accurately help evaluate the overall project performance or success.	fuzzy logic;utility	S.-K. Lee;J.-H.

5ecaadd2dc0e646e0c76e12a033583cd4b1dd99e	a group decision support model based on incomplete hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relations for mine disaster rescue		Owing to the uncertainty and complexity of decision-making environments, it is more suitable for decision makers (DMs) to express their preferences by means of hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relation (HFLPR). Furthermore, incomplete assessments usually exist in complex decision-making problems because DMs lack knowledge related to the problem domain. This paper proposes a group decision-making (GDM) model based on incomplete HFLPRs. First, we review the additive consistency of HFLPR and introduce the concept of incomplete HFLPR. Second, two proposals are developed to supplement the missing elements of incomplete HFLPR. Third, an HFLPR is improved and developed into an additive HFLPR to obtain a rational result. Moreover, a consensus-reaching process is established to solve a GDM on the basis of the obtained consistent HFLPRs. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results, the proposed model is applied to a mining disaster rescue attempt.	decision support system;problem domain;utility functions on indivisible goods	Yongming Song;Jun Hu	2018	Progress in Artificial Intelligence	10.1007/s13748-018-0145-9	artificial intelligence;data mining;machine learning;fuzzy logic;computer science;preference relation;group decision-making;decision support system;linguistics;problem domain	AI	-4.995261396825141	-21.35369944212422	115984

In Turkey, reallocation studies carried out in the scope of land consolidation projects are made according to farmer preferences (interviews). In addition to interview-based land reallocation model, mathematical models have been used in the previous optimization studies for reallocation procedure. Recently, fuzzy logic method, which is capable of modeling human mindset and used when other forms of mathematical models cannot be developed, has also been applied to the field of geomatic engineering, as well as in other engineering branches. This study examined the applicability of a fuzzy logic method at the reallocation stage of land consolidation study, where development of an accurate mathematical model was not possible. The results obtained from the fuzzy logic-based land reallocation model were compared with those obtained from the interview-based land reallocation model. Farmers were surveyed to determine which land reallocation model they preferred. The results indicate that 80.5% of the participant landholdings were satisfied with the fuzzy logic-based reallocation land model, while 50% were with the interview-based land reallocation model.	expert system;semiconductor consolidation	Tayfun Cay;Fatih Iscan	2011	Expert Syst.

Compared with the traditional model represented by the Simon and Gutowitz (SG) model [1], all the vehicles in cooperative model can obtain the speed and headway of other vehicles around. With vehicle-to-vehicle(V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, we have shown the new rules for lane change and speed update. Some simulation experiments are given to analyse the two models more intuitively. The results show that the cooperative model has an advantage on flow, overtaking frequency, successful lane change possibility and average speed, which indicates that the traffic efficiency has been improved significantly.	automata theory;cellular automaton;consensus dynamics;experiment;simulation;suicidegirls;vehicle-to-vehicle	Yaohan He;Danya Yao;Yi Zhang;Xin Pei;Li Li	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety (ICVES)	10.1109/ICVES.2016.7548172	simulation;engineering;transport engineering;computer security	Robotics	-18.238776783610213	-22.24861918794252	116411
b25dc4e814ff25bdd4b75c56eecdc1028337fc42	the leviathan model without gossips and vanity: the richness of influence based on perceived hierarchy		This paper studies a simplified version of the Leviathan model, without gossip and vanity processes. During dyadic meetings, the agents change their opinion about themselves and about their interlocutor. Speakers highly valued by their listeners are more influential. Only due to the asymmetry of the influence function, the model produces several patterns depending on the parameter values, some of which not yet identified in the first Leviathan model study. In particular, in some cases the leaders have a high opinion of other leaders whereas in other cases they have a low one. The recently proposed Leviathan model [1] considers a population of agents, each characterized by its opinion (a continuous number between -1 and +1) about each of the agents (including itself), and dynamics of these opinions through processes of opinion propagation and vanity, taking place during random dyadic encounters. This model is very rich in terms of emerging behaviors, and [1] focuses only on a limited set of parameter values. To go further, we propose here a more complete study of one of the model’s basic processes which is the direct opinion propagation (without gossiping). Whereas in many opinion models, the influence increases with the similarity between the agents (homophily [2] [3-5] [6]), in the Leviathan model, the influence increases with the superiority of the speaker as perceived by the listener (difference between listener’s opinion about the speaker and listener’s self-opinion). This modelling choice can be grounded in the research in social psychology considering for example [7] or [8] who has experimentally shown that people feeling high in power tends to discount other’s advice on the contrary those feeling low. Indeed, complementary to the classical approaches based on homophily, a large body of work considers the influence in terms of credibility of the source [9-11]. The influence function of the Leviathan model is a sigmoid logistic model. This model is more classically used as a probabilistic version of a threshold model [12] [13]. Surprisingly, and even in the absence of vanity and gossip, the model generates a rich variety of patterns and this paper aims at identifying and characterizing them. It is organised as follows. We start by a description of the dynamics. Then, we describe the observed patterns and offer some generalised definitions of their characteristics as well as how they appear during trajectories of the model. We especially point out the link between the influence function parameters, the level of agreement of agents about Author-produced version of the paper presented at Social Simulation Conference 2015, Sept 14-18, Groningen, NLD		Sylvie Huet;Guillaume Deffuant	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-47253-9_13	psychology;artificial intelligence;communication;social psychology	AI	-15.162977116653776	-15.459068455626573	116602

In This work, he first examines how organizational structuring was used in their design to reduce the computational and communication load involved in coordinating agent activities, and he discusses experiments that indicate the complex set of issues that need to be considered in evaluating the effectiveness of different organizational variants. He also briefly illustrates how it is possible to model the performance of these variants analytically, and predicts their performance. He then presents bottom-up techniques, based on negotiation, for organizational instantiation and adaptation in a dynamic environment. Finally, he discusses some work on a knowledge-based top-down approach for organizational design.	agent-based model;experiment;image scaling;multi-agent system;scalability;sensor;top-down and bottom-up design;universal instantiation;vehicle tracking system	Victor R.

Despite the many end user benefits of pervasive computing, the intrinsic instability and context ambiguities of these environments pose impediments to data-oriented decision support systems. In pervasive computing environments where users, systems, and computing resources are distributed or mobile, the online or “available” state of decision support-related resources may be intermittent or delayed. Awareness or knowledge of these resources’ online presence and availability can affect the decision making process. This article discusses issues related to data-driven decision support systems (DSS) in pervasive computing environments (PCE) and demonstrates that a decision maker’s awareness of online status and availability can improve decision outcomes. A model for extending DSS resource presence and availability awareness to decision makers is presented and the impact of this knowledge on decision outcomes is evaluated using a management problem simulation.	awareness;decision support system;instability;simulation;ubiquitous computing	Stephen Russell;Guisseppi A.

This method aggregates preference information of negotiators of CWCP in two steps. Firstly, compromise group preference order is ascertained by using preference information, which is newly provided by negotiators, and compromise preference information, which is formed in previously agent-based automatically negotiation process and calculated by using a compromise preference model. Secondly, group preferences are aggregated by using a relative entropy model, which is established based on entropy theory meanwhile considering the multiple attributes in negotiation of CWCP. The method of REAMNE has the merit of fulfilling the necessary requirement of group decision making (GDM), i.e. maximizing preference consistency of GDM and keeping minimum gap of negotiators' utility and group preference.

Our goal in this paper is to model and investigate the impact of such externalities on security investments in a network.  Specifically, we study a network of interconnected agents subject to epidemic risks such as viruses and worms where agents can decide whether or not to invest some amount to deploy security solutions. We consider both cases when the security solutions are strong (they perfectly protect the agents deploying them) and when they are weak. We make three contributions in the paper. First, we introduce a general model which combines an epidemic propagation model with an economic model for agents which captures network effects and externalities. Second, borrowing ideas and techniques used in statistical physics, we introduce a Local Mean Field (LMF) model, which extends the standard mean-field approximation to take into account the correlation structure on local neighborhoods. Third, we solve the LMF model in a network with externalities, and we derive analytic solutions for sparse random graphs of agents, for which we obtain asymptotic results. We find known phenomena such as free riders and tipping points. We also observe counter-intuitive phenomena, such as increasing the quality of the security technology can result in a decreased adoption of that technology in the network. In general, we find that both situations with strong and weak protection exhibit externalities and that the equilibrium is not socially optimal - therefore there is a market failure. Insurance is one mechanism to address this market failure. In related work, we have shown that insurance is a very effective mechanism [3,4], and argue that using insurance would increase the security in a network such as the Internet.	approximation;computer virus;internet;lexical markup framework;mean field particle methods;random graph;software propagation;sparse matrix	Marc Lelarge;Jean-Chrysostome Bolot	2008		10.1145/1403027.1403034	actuarial science;economics;public economics;mean field theory;network effect;microeconomics;mathematical economics;welfare economics	ECom	-13.267969353713257	-16.023637257788767	117048
93b245bc1025fc4379824ac855055d6273d79ead	ethnocentrism maintains cooperation, but keeping one's children close fuels it		Ethnocentrism, commonly thought to rely on complex social cognition, can arise through biological evolution in populations with minimal cognitive abilities. In fact, ethnocentrism is considered to be one of the simplest mechanisms for establishing cooperation in the competitive environment of natural selection. Here we study a recent agent-based model. Through our simulations and analysis, we establish that the mechanism responsible for the emergence of cooperation is children residing close to their parents. Our results suggest that group tags maintain cooperation, but do not create it. We formalize this observation as the dual direct hypothesis: ethnocentric agents dominate humanitarian agents by exploiting the unconditional cooperation of humanitarians of different tags to maintain the number of ethnocentric agents after world saturation. We affirm previous observations on the importance of world saturation, finding its drastic effect on dynamics in both spatial tagbased and tag-less models.	agent-based model;emergence;evolution;population;simulation;social cognition	Artem Kaznatcheev;Thomas R.

92ec8259e58f5107057e4e99fdcd03df6a08f9e7	emergent communication through negotiation		Multi-agent reinforcement learning offers a way to study how communication could emerge in communities of agents needing to solve specific problems. In this paper, we study the emergence of communication in the negotiation environment, a semi-cooperative model of agent interaction. We introduce two communication protocols – one grounded in the semantics of the game, and one which is a priori ungrounded and is a form of cheap talk. We show that self-interested agents can use the pre-grounded communication channel to negotiate fairly, but are unable to effectively use the ungrounded channel. However, prosocial agents do learn to use cheap talk to find an optimal negotiating strategy, suggesting that cooperation is necessary for language to emerge. We also study communication behaviour in a setting where one agent interacts with agents in a community with different levels of prosociality and show how agent identifiability can aid negotiation.	channel (communications);emergent;multi-agent system;reinforcement learning;semiconductor industry	Kris Cao;Angeliki Lazaridou;Marc Lanctot;Joel Z.

The novel concept of Weighted Belief Distribution (WBD) is proposed and extended to WBD with Reliability (WBDR) to characterise evidence in complement of Belief Distribution (BD) introduced in Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory of evidence. The implementation of the orthogonal sum operation on WBDs and WBDRs leads to the establishment of the new ER rule. The most important property of the new ER rule is that it constitutes a generic conjunctive probabilistic reasoning process, or a generalised Bayesian inference process. It is shown that the original ER algorithm is a special case of the ER rule when the reliability of evidence is equal to its weight and the weights of all pieces of evidence are normalised. It is proven that [email protected]?s rule is also a special case of the ER rule when each piece of evidence is fully reliable. The ER rule completes and enhances [email protected]?s rule by identifying how to combine pieces of fully reliable evidence that are highly or completely conflicting through a new reliability perturbation analysis. The main properties of the ER rule are explored to facilitate its applications. Several existing rules are discussed and compared with the ER rule. Numerical and simulation studies are conducted to show the features of the ER rule.		Jian-Bo Yang;Dong-Ling Xu	2013	Artif.

6cd7ffda32a45402ef9e007f816716a5b48a6c63	semantically equivalent model for quality evaluation		Modeling data quality model is a critical operation to assess the quality of data and fulfill requirements of users. First, several models have been proposed by researchers, and then ISO standards make their apparition to specify quality requirements and evaluate systems and software products. These models have been constructed hierarchically, defined by criteria, sub-criteria and metrics. Studies show the divergence of names and different criteria meaning of such quality model, since there is no universal definition of data quality criteria. Each researcher has its own interpretation and must adapt each model to a specific use field. Faced with this situation, a global data model that contains several data quality models related to each other using equivalence relations is proposed. It offers a generic way to manipulate, explore and quantify any criterion of different data quality models. Our new approach aims at expressing relationships of equivalence among several criteria belonging to different quality models. We use fuzzy logic concepts to evaluate the specified data quality model that was obtained after the application of the equivalent relationships model.	data model;data quality;fuzzy logic;requirement;turing completeness	Madjid Kara;Olfa Lamouchi;Amar Ramdane-Cherif	2017		10.1145/3018896.3056776	fuzzy logic;equivalence (measure theory);computer network;data mining;equivalence relation;semantic equivalence;computer science;data model;software;data modeling;data quality	SE	-4.872375639847398	-23.91330249789173	118002

a22bba0efa6eea87807e4305e857521372683357	boosting cultural algorithms with a heterogeneous layered social fabric influence function	cultural algorithms;knowledge swarming;real valued function optimization	In this paper we investigate the emergence and power of a complex social system based upon principles of cultural evolution. Cultural Algorithms employ a basic set of knowledge sources, each related to knowledge observed in various social species. Here we extend the influence and integration function in Cultural Algorithms by adding a mechanism by which knowledge sources can spread their influence throughout a population in the presence of a heterogeneous layered social network. The interaction (overlapping) of the knowledge sources, represented as bounding boxes on the landscape, at the right level projects how efficient the cooperation is between the agents in the resultant “Social Network”. The inter-related structures that emerge with this approach are critical to the effective functioning of the approach. We view these structures as constituting a “normal form” for Cultures within these real-valued optimization landscapes. Our goal will be to identify the minimum social structure needed to solve problems of certain complexities. If this can be accomplished, it means that there will be a correspondence between the social structure and the problem environment in which it emerged. An escalating sequence of complex benchmark problems to our system will be presented. We conclude by suggesting the emergent features are what give cultural systems their power to learn and adapt.

0216e006ffd738ca6c6a4cad26fefab3aa84ecbc	the power of context in networks: ideal point models with social interactions		Game theory has been widely used for modeling strategic behaviors in networked multiagent systems. However, the context within which these strategic behaviors take place has received limited attention. We present a model of strategic behavior in networks that incorporates the behavioral context. We focus on the contextual aspects of congressional voting. A senator’s decision to vote yea or nay on a bill comes as a result of their ideologies, agendas, and their interactions with other senators. One salient model in political science is the ideal point model, which assigns each senator and each bill a number on the real line of political spectrum. These points then allow for prediction of future voting behavior. We extend the classical ideal point model with network-structured interactions among senators. In contrast to the ideal point model’s prediction of individual voting behavior, we predict joint voting behaviors in a game-theoretic fashion. Our model also includes the characteristics of a bill. This allows it to outperform previous models that solely focus on the networked interactions among senators with no bill-specific parameters. We focus on two fundamental questions: learning the model using real-world data and computing stable outcomes of the model in order to predict joint voting behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model through experiments using data from the 114th U.S. Congress.	agent-based model;experiment;game theory;interaction;multi-agent system	Mohammad Tanvir Irfan;Tucker Gordon	2018			game theory;machine learning;computer science;artificial intelligence;salient;multi-agent system;social network;voting;ideology;voting behavior;political spectrum	AI	-15.606503483573034	-12.536473089419149	118862

Despite hard clustering methods having several weaknesses, they remain widely applied in marketing studies. Alternative segmentation methods such as fuzzy methods are rarely used to understand consumer behaviour. In this study, we propose a strategy of analysis, by combining the Bagged Clustering (BC) method and the fuzzy C-means clustering method for fuzzy data (FCM-FD), i.e., the Bagged fuzzy C–means clustering method for fuzzy data (BFCM-FD). The method inherits the advantages of stability and reproducibility from BC and the flexibility from FCM-FD. The method is applied on a sample of 328 Chinese consumers revealing the existence of four segments (Admirers, Enthusiasts, Moderates, and Apathetics) of the perceived images of Western Europe as a tourist destination. The results highlight the heterogeneity in Chinese consumers’ place preferences and implications for place marketing are offered.	cluster analysis;fuzzy clustering;fuzzy cognitive map;fuzzy concept;fuzzy logic	Pierpaolo D'Urso;Marta Disegna;Riccardo Massari;Girish Prayag	2015	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2014.10.015	fuzzy clustering;data mining	Web+IR	-7.231704038190828	-20.98700302483798	118874

This workshop addresses robustness and cooperation in holonic multi-agent systems within a context of self-organizing and selfadaptive systems. The paper first presents the basic principles underlying holonic systems. The holonic system reveals itself as a ‘law of the artificial’: in a demanding and dynamic environment, all the larger systems will be holonic. Next, it addresses robustness in holonic systems, including its relationship to self-organization and self-adaptation. These self-* systems indeed are capable of delivering superior robustness. Third, it addresses cooperation in holons and holonic systems, including its relationship with the autonomy of the individual holons. Cooperation imposes constraints on a holon such that its chances of survival and success increase.	adaptive system;autonomous robot;autonomy;complex network;entity;fault detection and isolation;holon (philosophy);instability;interaction;multi-agent system;online and offline;organizing (structure);robustness (computer science);self-organization	Paulo Leitão;Paul Valckenaers;Emmanuel Adam	2009	Trans.

Dynamic testing is critical for understanding the mechanical response of ground support used in seismically active locations of a mine. In the past, dynamic testing of ground support has generally been somewhat qualitative, but currently more quantitative testing is being employed. This paper describes the sensors and data acquisition system used to record the dynamic measurements of the shock tests performed by SMRD. It includes a discussion of sensor selection and installation to serve as an initial guide for future research. Testing of ground support and its response to dynamic loading can lead to developments that improve mine worker safety in seismically active underground mines.	data acquisition;display resolution;dynamic loading;dynamic testing;sensor	Carl Sunderman;Jerald Richardson;Michael Raffaldi	2017	2017 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2017.8101842	occupational safety and health;structural engineering;dynamic loading;dynamic testing;seismic loading;data acquisition;instrumentation;engineering	Robotics	-12.95629113919166	-18.92591365558432	118972

Dynamism is supported through arrival and departure processes, continuous restructuring of risk relationships, and changes to pathogen infectiousness, as mandated by natural history; dynamism is regulated through constraints on the local agency of individual nodes and their risk behaviors, while simulation trajectories are validated using system-wide metrics. To illustrate its utility, we present a case study that applies the proposed framework towards a simulation of HIV in artificial networks of intravenous drug users (IDUs) modeled using data collected in the Social Factors for HIV Risk survey.	agent-based model;behavior;drug abuser;natural history;numerous;pathogenic organism;simulation;social network;software propagation;disease transmission	Bilal Khan;Kirk Dombrowski;Mohamed Saad	2014	Simulation	10.1177/0037549714526947	text mining;simulation;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;artificial intelligence;data science;data mining;system dynamics	ML	-17.00594166303028	-23.49346599672073	119199

Two examples of such systems are supply chain networks and sensor networks. A common challenge in many networked multi-agent systems is decentralized team formation among the spatially and logically extended agents. Even in cooperative multi-agent systems, efficient team formation is made difficult by the limited local information available to the individual agents. We present a model of distributed multi-agent team formation in networked multi-agent systems, describe a policy learning framework for joining teams based on local information, and give empirical results on improving team formation performance. In particular, we show that local policy learning from limited information leads to a significant increase in organizational team formation performance compared to a random policy.	autonomous robot;interdependence;multi-agent system;situated;social network;supply chain network	Blazej Bulka;Matthew E.

058b6ce94c6b1c8bfcdf4d689475bb3a9e958c28	mathematical models of coordination mechanisms in multi-agent systems		The good performance of a set of computer systems based on agents depends on the coherence degree and coordination between their activities. The study of coordination problem is an important topic for designers and researchers in the multi-agents systems field. There are several coordination mechanisms in the current literature, being the auction and the contract net the most popular ones. These mechanisms allow the agents to allocate resources and tasks to achieve their objectives. This paper aims to present formal models of the auction and the contract net as coordination mechanisms in multi-agents systems based on FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) Protocols. Mathematical equations describe the different parameters characterizing the auction and the contract net mechanisms; they allow define a generic structure of each mechanism and groups of agents can create several instances of them to coordinate their needs.	automated planning and scheduling;computer science;contract net protocol;cultural algorithm;emergence;linear algebra;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system	Juan Terán;José Aguilar-Castro;Mariela Cerrada-Lozada	2013	CLEI Electron.

The first step consists of comparing two different approaches: a macroscopic one, based on a system of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) systems exploiting populations on nodes and flows on edges (so-called metapopulational model), and a hybrid one, coupling ODE SIR systems on nodes and agents traveling on edges. Under homogeneous conditions (mean field approximation), this comparison leads to similar results on the outputs on which we focus (the maximum intensity of the epidemic, its duration and the time of the epidemic peak). However, when it comes to setting up epidemic control strategies, results rapidly diverge between the two approaches, and it appears that the full macroscopic model is not completely adapted to these questions. In this paper, we focus on some control strategies, which are quarantine, avoidance and risk culture, to explore the differences, advantages and disadvantages of the two models and discuss the importance of being hybrid when modeling and simulating epidemic spread at the level of a whole urban system.	approximation;mean field particle methods;population;quarantine (computing);simulation	Arnaud Banos;Nathalie Corson;Benoit Gaudou;Vincent Laperrière;Sebastien Rey-Coyrehourcq	2015	Systems	10.3390/systems3040309	simulation;metapopulation;mobile computing;operations research;ode	AI	-14.339215391711623	-17.63819782569101	119325
51e83f8feea9c63872cf5bccf44703b31017014d	fuzzy decision support system for ship lock control	scada;decision support;fuzzy control;ship lock	This paper presents the development of a Decision Support System (DSS) for the management of ship locks that relies on fuzzy logic. It contains a brief overview of the history and the construction of locks and basic information related to fuzzy logic, fuzzy linguistic variables and methods used in approximate reasoning. In reality, ship lock control is mostly based on the subjective estimations and the experience of a lock master (ship lock operator). The fuzzy set theory is the most favourable mathematical approach for consideration of indefiniteness and subjective estimates. This paper analyses the control process of a ship lock on a two-way waterway, with one chamber designed for one vessel. A control algorithm is constructed according to a set of linguistic rules that describes the operator's control strategy. The subjective estimations are therefore implemented in the algorithm as fuzzy sets. Fuzzy rules aggregate the final fuzzy set and defuzzification produces a decision. A set of ship traffic data is generated for analysis and simulation purposes based on the annual distribution of ship arrivals at the lock. Two criteria are presented and used in parallel with the Fuzzy DSS (FDSS). These two extreme criteria reflect the interests of shippers on one side and workers and owners of the lock on the other side. These interests occur in actual systems and are used here to evaluate the results obtained using the FDSS. This paper additionally describes the design of the SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) software. This software relies on a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and provides a platform on which to implement the desired fuzzy algorithm. The software was developed with the suggestions of operators who have extensive experience in ship lock control. The presented control system can be used for support in decision making in control processes and in the training of new operators of ship locks.	decision support system	Vladimir Bugarski;Todor Backalic;Uros Kuzmanov	2013	Expert Syst.

These functions range from common ones such as warehouse and transportation management to less known ones such as demand management. In order to execute and manage the supply chain processes successfully, organisations need a comprehensive evaluation approach to determine the most suitable system. The evaluation of an SCEM system involves numerous decision making criteria. Moreover, it is usually characterised with uncertainty and vagueness since it is very difficult to rate SCEM system alternatives with exact terms. To cope with this problem, a fuzzy logic-based approach is developed in this study. This approach main integrates the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process to weight the decision criteria and the Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution to rate alternatives. A real life example is provided to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach.	enterprise software;fuzzy logic;management system;real life;vagueness	Sinan Apak;Özalp Vayvay;Orhan Feyzioglu	2013	Int.

ff80078a999dc9ddfe62f90611e9153b8d6e47e0	role of conviction in non-equilibrium models of opinion formation		We analyze the critical behavior of a class of discrete opinion models in the presence of disorder. Within this class, each agent opinion takes a discrete value (± 1 or 0) and its time evolution is ruled by two terms, one representing agent-agent interactions and the other the degree of conviction or persuasion (a self-interaction). The mean-field limit, where each agent can interact evenly with any other, is considered. Disorder is introduced in the strength of both interactions, with either quenched or annealed random variables. With probability p (1-p), a pairwise interaction reflects a negative (positive) coupling, while the degree of conviction also follows a binary probability distribution (two different discrete probability distributions are considered). Numerical simulations show that a nonequilibrium continuous phase transition, from a disordered state to a state with a prevailing opinion, occurs at a critical point p(c) that depends on the distribution of the convictions, with the transition being spoiled in some cases. We also show how the critical line, for each model, is affected by the update scheme (either parallel or sequential) as well as by the kind of disorder (either quenched or annealed).	continuous phase;critical point (network science);interaction;kind of quantity - equilibrium;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;phase transition;simulation	Nuno Crokidakis;Celia Anteneodo	2012	Physical review.

13d8cdb86e6156a3456115999dd7de3b38c077db	on the role of individuals in models of coupled human and natural systems: lessons from a case study in the republican river basin	irrigation;agent based modeling;high plains aquifer;human behavior;coupled human and natural systems	In models of coupled human and natural systems (CHANS), the role of individuals and human behavior is often overlooked as data are scarce and assumptions hard to verify. To assess this role, we couple an agent-based model simulating farmers' behavior and a groundwater model and apply the models to the case of groundwater-fed irrigation in a river basin in the High Plains Aquifer region. Results show the crucial role of human behavior in driving the interactions between these coupled systems. Conversely, individuals are impacted by the systems’ dynamics in different ways depending on physical, economic and social characteristics. The findings provide implications for local policy making and education and demonstrate that assumptions on human behavior could be treated as an additional source of uncertainty. This work suggests that modeling individuals and human behavior can be an important step to simulate and understand the dynamics of CHANS in a holistic way.		Paul H.

More than 100,000 visitors travel by Metro. This creates large pedestrian flows inside the station causing major discomfort due to crowding. With the steady increase of the flows in recent years a crowd management plan has been developed and applied to mitigate crowding problems. The plan identified the station as an open system with a feedback mechanism (crowd-management). The station system itself is connected to other systems such as the station surroundings and the trains. An offline analysis before the event identified the individual capacities of the station components, their dynamic properties, mutual influences and dependency to other systems. As a follow-up of these analyses, six crowd-management measures were. These measures and a new crowd-management plan enforced during the operations improved the safety and comfort of pedestrians during the 2012-2013 event. The bottlenecks were better understood and anticipated by their capacity increased causing significantly less crowding in the station and allowing a rapid action of marshals when an emergency occurred. The improved results obtained using few aspects of systems suggest that a methodology based on system engineering could be developed to plan and assess large crowds events.	bottleneck (software);crowding;diagram;eve;feedback;flowchart;knowledge management;metro (design language);nonlinear system;online and offline;open system (computing);system analysis;systems engineering;winsock	Mario Campanella;Rafael Halliday;Serge P.

Therefore, recently, much attention has been focused on reactive planning systems such as behavior-based AI systems. However, in behavior-based AI approaches, the way to construct a mechanism that realizes adequate arbitration among competence modules is still an open question. In this paper, we propose a new decentralized consensus-making system, inspired by biological immune systems, and we apply our proposed method to a behavior arbitration of an autonomous mobile robot as a practical example. To verify the feasibility of our method, we carry out some experiments. In addition, we propose an adaptation mechanism and try to construct a suitable immune network for adequate action selection.

Further, a feedback acting on the temperature is introduced, such that social temperature reacts to market imbalances and thus becomes time dependent. In this toy market model, social temperature represents nervousness of agents toward market imbalances representing speculative risk. We use the knowledge about the discontinuous generalized voter model phase transition to determine critical fixed points. The system exhibits metastable phases around these fixed points characterized by structured lattice states, with intermittent excursions away from the fixed points. The statistical mechanics of the model is characterized, and its relation to dynamics of opinion formation among investors in real markets is discussed.	exhibits as topic;feedback;fixed point (mathematics);nervousness;phase transition;respiratory mechanics;speculative execution;voter model	Sebastian M.

Adaptive temporal-causal network models incorporate a dynamic perspective on causal relations in which the states in the network change over time due to the causal relations, and these causal relations themselves also change over time. It is discussed how modelling and analysis of the dynamics of the behaviour of these network models can be performed.	causal filter	Jan Treur	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-50901-3_6	network model;machine learning;artificial intelligence;computer science	Robotics	-19.019807474962263	-15.206691772991704	120513

Here we will improve the Coleman model of trust. We believe that only if one agent is in the trustworthy group can the other agents trust it. In this paper, we mainly devote ourselves to the work of management of agents according to their reputation: we take advantage of FNHMS (Fuzzy Non-homogeneous Markov System) to model the agent system, during which three population parameters and two basic parameters are defined to deduce the transition probabilities matrix, so lastly we can simulate the change of the scale of trustworthy agents and know the whole distribution of agents about their reputation. Finally our experimental results prove that the theoretical results are true, and our improvement of the Coleman model of trust is fit and reasonable.	markov chain;multi-agent system;simulation;trust (emotion)	Guangquan Xu;Zhiyong Feng;Gang Wang;Huabei Wu	2007	2007 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology - Workshops		computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;fuzzy set;markov process	AI	-11.509292987034174	-11.839035658362937	120759

The sheer amount of data flowing in these networks, combined with the limited budget of attention of each user, makes it difficult to ensure that social filtering brings relevant content to interested users. Our motivation in this paper is to measure to what extent self-organization of a social network results in efficient social filtering. To this end we introduce flow games, a simple abstraction that models network formation under selfish user dynamics, featuring user-specific interests and budget of attention. In the context of homogeneous user interests, we show that selfish dynamics converge to a stable network structure (namely a pure Nash equilibrium) with close-to-optimal information dissemination. We show that, in contrast, for the more realistic case of heterogeneous interests, selfish dynamics may lead to information dissemination that can be arbitrarily inefficient, as captured by an unbounded “price of anarchy”. Nevertheless the situation differs when user interests exhibit a particular structure, captured by a metric space with low doubling dimension. In that Supported by PROSE ANR project.

We investigate the properties of trust propagation on networks, based on a simple metric of trust transitivity. We investigate analytically the percolation properties of trust transitivity in random networks with arbitrary in/out-degree distributions, and compare with numerical realizations. We find that the existence of a non-zero fraction of absolute trust (i.e. entirely confident trust) is a requirement for the viability of global trust propagation in large systems: The average pair-wise trust is marked by a discontinuous transition at a specific fraction of absolute trust, below which it vanishes. Furthermore, we perform an extensive analysis of the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) web of trust, in view of the concepts introduced. We compare different scenarios of trust distribution: community- and authority-centered. We find that these scenarios lead to sharply different patterns of trust propagation, due to the segregation of authority hubs and densely-connected communities. While the authority-centered scenario is more efficient, and leads to higher average trust values, it favours weakly-connected """"fringe"""" nodes, which are directly trusted by authorities. The community-centered scheme, on the other hand, favours nodes with intermediate in/out-degrees, in detriment of the authorities and its """"fringe"""" peers."""	arabic numeral 0;centralized computing;community;decision making;digital certification;directed graph;flow network;mixing (mathematics);numerical analysis;peer-to-peer file sharing;percolation;pretty good privacy;social network;software propagation;vertex-transitive graph;web of trust	Oliver Richters;Tiago P.

Traditionally, companies have considered factors such as price, quality, flexibility, etc. when evaluating suppliers. Meanwhile, increasing pressures urge them to consider green issues. This study proposes a multi-criteria evaluation model for supplier performance evaluation by considering various performance criteria. It is shown that these criteria are not independent, in other words simultaneous satisfaction of two or more criteria is required for a good rating, while unilateral success is ineffective. The conventional weighted mean can not deal with this aspect, and compromise operators are more suitable. In this sense, the operators of the Choquet integral family are interesting and are applied to evaluate the suppliers’ performance for an industrial case.	common criteria	Orhan Feyzioglu;Gülçin Büyüközkan	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-04045-0_12	operations management;commerce	ML	-4.556802783980427	-15.24982550387258	120802

Thus, theories on the best means of allocating existing road spaces for cars and buses in city-centers and suburban corridors in order to improve operational transport efficiency has become a frontier research topic. Today, bus priority (BP) methods, as one of the most widely used Public Transport Priority (PTP) strategies, are commonly recognized as effective in lowering traffic congestion and reducing bus travel times. PT authorities, urban planners/designers, and researchers dealing with PT issues (i.e. buses), need to investigate existing BP methods in detail and assess relevant research before setting about designing or implementing new policies. Of course, evaluating such studies is a time-consuming process. In order to address this constraint, the present study proposes a general typology of existing BP methods and evaluates the challenges and requirements regarding their implementation by conducting a comprehensive literature review of existing studies related to PTP. Academic papers (theoretical, analytical, and simulation-based), technical reports, and design manual/guidelines in the context of both developed and developing countries have been searched as part of the literature review process. The study concludes by proposing two comparative summary tables of all spatial bus priority schemes in terms of “min. requirements to justify BP schemes” and “advantages and disadvantages of time-based and spatial BP treatments”. These may provide engineers, urban planners or transit policy-makers with an accessible guide with which to refer in the evaluation stage. However, future research is recommended in order to bridge existing gaps concerning conditions required for the successful implementation of spatial bus priority strategies.

Our goal is to support decisions that save lives by helping to integrate real-time feedback and coordinate effective responses. Computational laboratories using super computing resources allow us to explore and optimize deployments of scarce resources and disruptive interventions for controlling pandemic influenza. We have developed an agent based model for simulating the diffusion of pandemic influenza via carefully calibrated inter-city airline travel. This and related simulation models at community scales can be used to learn vital lessons based on CPU-intensive virtual experience from millions of simulated pandemics. Real-time situation updates can greatly enhance the strategic usefulness of simulation models by providing accurate interim conditions for adapting effective deployments of interventions as a pandemic unfolds.	agent-based model;central processing unit;computation;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;risk assessment;simulation	Catherine Dibble	2010	Proceedings of the 2010 Winter Simulation Conference		atmospheric model;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;software agent;simulation modeling;mathematical model;transport engineering;management science;computational model;statistics	AI	-17.713503831926186	-23.022980984807152	121293

Traditional literature on innovation diffusion has been dominated by models of aggregate behavior and trends. However, the agent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm is gaining popularity as it captures agent heterogeneity and enables fine-grained modeling of interactions mediated by social and geographic networks. While most ABM work on innovation diffusion is theoretical, empirically grounded models are increasingly important, particularly in guiding policy decisions. We present a critical review of empirically grounded agent-based models of innovation diffusion, developing a categorization of this research based on types of agent models as well as applications. By connecting the modeling methodologies in the fields of information and innovation diffusion, we suggest that the maximum likelihood estimation framework widely used in the former is a promising paradigm for calibration of agent-based models for innovation diffusion. Although many advances have been made to standardize ABM methodology, we identify four major issues in model calibration and validation, and suggest potential solutions.	agent-based model;aggregate data;categorization;computation;computational model;computer science;consistency model;decision support system;ecology;graph coloring;heuristic;interaction;machine learning;mathematical optimization;programming paradigm;sed	Haifeng Zhang;Yevgeniy Vorobeychik	2017	Artificial Intelligence Review	10.1007/s10462-017-9577-z	artificial intelligence;machine learning;aggregate behavior;maximum likelihood;management science;categorization;computer science;popularity;knowledge management	ML	-17.76261092136618	-18.427980813031233	121658

For efficiency concern, negotiation should occur among only those with target-related expertise and it should be concurrent. This paper presents a self-organizing concurrent negotiation model which allows an agent to identify those with related expertise via consensus before concurrently negotiating with them. This process can be repeated till an agreement is reached or the negotiation fails. Furthermore, the agents’ problem solving ability could also be enhanced via information exchange during this process.

As human and economic damage is increasing by these disasters, interest in disaster observation and prevention is increasing and studies have been carried out in various fields. In order to minimize disaster damage, National Disaster Information Center provides disaster-related information such as disaster situations, risk index, local situation and so on. At present, however, various descriptive studies on action tips in the event of a disaster, disaster alert, disaster communications network have been in progress but there are few studies on prediction or simulation for preventing disasters etc. Therefore, this paper proposes a slope-based intelligent 3D disaster simulation using a physics engine. The proposed method is to infer a variety of disaster situations that may occur in reality through ontology and apply it to 3D simulation. Disaster situation ontology constitutes context information of outside, inside, disasters etc. and generates rule bases using Jena 2.0 inference engine. Inference results are derived in the form of XML and applicable to a variety of devices. The expression of 3D simulation virtual space is divided into interior and exterior. Interior constitutes the index information based on actually measured terrain and then expresses it into 3D compound type terrain data. Exterior expresses six planes into a hexahedron by using Sky Box technique. Simulation operates object collision, movement, surroundings etc. in real time by using a physics engine and represents a disaster situation in 3D virtual space by using particles function. Based on ontology based context awareness, environment context information on slope, including landslides, snow, rain, fogs, fire, explosion, and smoke, is developed into the slope based intelligent 3D disaster simulation. As a result, depending on geomorphic characteristics, disaster management service can realistically and visually be offered to users in 3D virtual reality. In addition, it is possible to experimentally apply disaster situations virtually through 3D virtual reality, and thereby judge their potential risk.

This is the situation in the town of Tarawa in Kiribati, where attempts to improve water services have often not led to the desired outcomes. The reasons are varied, and include widely a lack of consideration of local circumstances, process requirements, and inadequate involvement of affected stakeholders, and inadequate cross-sectoral coordination. In light of the tendency in urban water planning to assume only the idealized performance of strategies, the authors argue that there is a need to also formally consider the likelihood of realizing this idealized performance. It is difficult to assess such likelihoods, other than via the use of judgments by expert and local stakeholders. Such judgments are typically qualitative and fairly abstract and often not directly concerning a particular strategy. The current paper provides a methodology to assess the likelihood of the idealized performance of strategies, based on Bayesian Networks (BNs) and Subjective Logic (SL) utilizing expert and local knowledge, creating a capacity to capture and apply previous experiences, and dispersed knowledge in decision making and planning. The methodology has been developed and tested on water management strategies in the town of Tarawa, Kiribati. As such, this paper provides a method for mapping the causal explanations for why developments do not achieve their set goals, and the approach may form the basis for assessments to be more widely applied when evaluating urban water strategies in similar contexts. In this paper, the approach has been applied by using existing data from interviews and literature to evaluate one strategy, reserve extensions and groundwater extraction. Other strategies, i.e. rainwater harvesting, desalination and have also been evaluated but have not been described in this paper because of limited space.

However, there are some drawbacks for data mining tool, such as neural networks has long training times and genetic algorithm is brute computing method. This study proposes a new procedure, joining quantitative value of RFM attributes and K-means algorithm into rough set theory (RS theory), to extract meaning rules, and it can effectively improve these drawbacks. Three purposes involved in this study in the following: (1) discretize continuous attributes to enhance the rough sets algorithm; (2) cluster customer value as output (customer loyalty) that is partitioned into 3, 5 and 7 classes based on subjective view, then see which class is the best in accuracy rate; and (3) find out the characteristic of customer in order to strengthen CRM. A practical collected C-company dataset in Taiwan’s electronic industry is employed in empirical case study to illustrate the proposed procedure. Referring to [Hughes, A. M. (1994). Strategic database marketing.

To demonstrate our approach we introduce an abstract task environment in which agents have to cooperate to achieve their goals. These agents are capable of using two coordination mechanisms, a centralized and a decentralized mechanism. We show how the decision making framework is operationalized in this abstract task environment. Furthermore, in an experiment we compare the performance of two static organizations with an organization in which agents have the ability to switch between coordination mechanisms. Results show that the ability to switch improves performance of the MAS.	centralized computing	Mattijs Ghijsen;Wouter N. H. Jansweijer;Bob J.

The method of configuration is one of important ways to realize quickly product customization. But, in business, particularly through the Internet, a customer normally develops in his mind some sort of ambiguity, given the choice of similar alternative products. This paper proposes a new approach to product configuration by applying the theory of fuzzy multiple attribute decision making (FMADM), which focus on uncertain and fuzzy requirements the customer submits to the product supplier. The proposed method can be used either in the product data management system or e-commerce websites, with which it is easy for customers to get his preferred product according to the utility value with respect to all attributes. Finally, the digital camera is taken as an example to further verify the validity and the feasibility of the proposed method.	knowledge-based configuration	Bin Zhu;Zhan Wang;Haicheng Yang;Rong Mo;Yanwei Zhao	2008	J.

Each agent has different case structure with intersecting features and agents exploit all information related to the problem by co-operation, which is accomplished through the merge of distributed cases in order to form cases having better representation of the problem. The presented merge algorithm handles noisy distributed cases by negotiation on the difference values of the intersecting features. The role-based CBR agents merge the distributed cases by introducing a global heuristic function, which is used to evaluate the relevance of merged cases. The heuristic function exploits the relevancy of each merged case within the viewpoint of each agent and the satisfied/unsatisfied problem constraints. The viewpoint of an agent is represented by the value of consistency of distributed components of merged cases and agent s individual...	association rule learning;case-based reasoning	M.

This article explores various models of information exchange for a multi-agent system. The main issue is the size and shape of each area controlled by each specific coordinator agent, because it affects the efficiency and effectiveness of exchanging the information between agents. For experimentation, three models namely circular, square and hexagonal grid models are compared, and we found out that the best model for information exchange is a hexagonal grid model, i.e., when the geographical boundaries are defined by hexagons.	information exchange;multi-agent system	Matthew Kotkowski;Hien Nguyen;Yonas Getahun;Vijay K.

The intention is to obtain some insight into the way the existing model may be applicable outside the current scope, e.g., to single moves and endgame studies. The full article consists of two parts. The first part contains two phases of experimentation which compare combinations taken from the domain of compositions and from real games. In both phases I use a yardstick of human-player aesthetic ratings. In this part, we report three results. First, it was discovered that only having a high positive correlation with the human rating does not necessarily mean that (this variation of) the model is viable. Second, variations of the existing model – in terms of the aesthetic features examined and the weights attributed to them – are demonstrably either worse or, in the minority of cases examined, at best equivalent in performance to it. So, my original model may, at this moment, be adequate. Third, experimental results lead to questions on the effectiveness of using different weights (even those provided by domain experts) with respect to aesthetic features for the purpose of discriminating between them in terms of inherent ‘importance’. In practice, any discriminating procedure was found to be unreliable and therefore it offered no improvement over the default intelligently designed feature evaluation functions that, in principle, do not value some features over others.

The accuracy of model-based software reliability assessment can be conducted by developing more plausible models. As to the approaches, generalized and discretized modeling schemes and reflecting testing environment are often discussed so far. This paper focuses on a debugging process for developing software reliability growth model. Concretely, we propose a few specific models for software reliability assessment by considering several debugging processes respectively based on the notion of a phase-type probability distribution. We show our approaches are expected to get better fitting performance compared with well-known existing model after model comparisons using actual software counting data, and clear the usefulness of a phase-type modeling approach.

An important task for social sciences research should therefore be to gain an understanding of language shifts, especially as a way of forecasting the extinction or survival of threatened languages, i.e., determining whether or not the subordinate language will survive in communities with a dominant and a subordinate language. In general, modeling is usually a very difficult task in the social sciences, particularly when it comes to forecasting the values of variables. However, the cellular automata theory can help us overcome this traditional difficulty. The purpose of this article is to investigate language shifts in the speech behavior of individuals using the methodology of the cellular automata theory. The findings on the dynamics of social impacts in the field of social psychology and the empirical data from language surveys on the use of Catalan in Valencia allowed us to define a cellular automaton and carry out a set of simulations using that automaton. The simulation results highlighted the key factors in the progression or reversal of a language shift and the use of these factors allowed us to forecast the future of a threatened language in a bilingual community.

96537a314dcfbce96b0ee17acc54539be744713d	opinion formation dynamics under the combined influences of majority and experts		Opinion formation modelling is still poorly understood due to the hardness and complexity of the abstraction of human behaviours under the presence of various types of social influences. Two such influences that shape the opinion formation process are: (i) the expert effect originated from the presence of experts in a social group and (ii) the majority effect caused by the presence of a large group of people sharing similar opinions. In real life when these two effects contradict each other, they force public opinions towards their respective directions. Existing models employed the concept of confidence levels associated with the opinions to model the expert effect. However, they ignored the majority effect explicitly, and thereby failed to capture the combined impact of these two influences on opinion evolution. Our model explicitly introduces the majority effect through the use of a concept called opinion consistency, and captures the opinion dynamics under the combined influence of majority supported opinions as well as experts’ opinions. Simulation results show that our model properly captures the consensus, polarization and fragmentation properties of public opinion and reveals the impact of the aforementioned effects.

The analytic hierarchy process-fuzzy logic model (AHP-FLM) approach is chosen for developing the model, a method that is often used to tackle complex strategic decision making that calls for subjective judgment based on well-established logical reasoning, rather than on simple feeling and intuition. In the process, the complex and unstructured problem for 'compatibility test' is broken down into elements, and then a customized hierarchy structure is set up to demonstrate the relationship between different hierarchy levels and among these elements. Each element may have a different level of importance for the horizontal collaboration. A fuzzy rule based collaboration intensity index (CII) is developed to build up the relationships among these evaluation attributes. Synthesizing the generic relative importance and the forecasted degree of collaboration, the proposed approach can determine the success of the collaboration initiative. An illustrative example of a semiconductor industry supply chain (SSC) member that intends to partner with a potential and competing candidate enterprise is developed to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed fuzzy strategic alliance selection framework and to measure the effectiveness of a horizontal collaboration initiative.	semiconductor device fabrication	Bikram K.

One of the key challenges of sustainability is the ability to examine the range of possible future paths of combined social and environmental conditions, under consideration of human perceptions, uncertainty and cause-effect factors, with possible feedback. Moreover, policy formulation and evaluation need to be addressed in an integrated and holistic way, where scoping goes beyond specific sectorial interests and includes multi-disciplinary knowledge, involving stakeholders from diverse backgrounds and with different objectives and aspirations. In this work we describe FCMp, a Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping methodology to help experts and lay experts develop, simulate and assess the impact of different policy alternatives on key variables in a particular environmental problem according to multiple perceptions. The FCMp allows for: 1) integration of cross-policy themes by modeling socio-economic and ecological indicators with possible feedback between them, 2) representation of qualitative knowledge using linguistic terms, and 3) stakeholder participation through scenario development and analysis. The FCMp uses “what-if” scenario analysis in order to derive future implications from current states. We demonstrate the usefulness of FCMp using a case study to elaborate and compare scenarios for a specific environmental issue.	ecological indicator;feedback;fuzzy cognitive map;holism;scenario analysis;scope (computer science);simulation	Asmaa Mourhir;Tajje-eddine Rachidi;Mohammed Karim	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2015.7337969	stakeholder;fuzzy cognitive map;uncertainty;knowledge management;management science;statistics	Robotics	-10.26671356297187	-19.6653320928327	123840
8c5d1a5352a08776468b6d568a6787534dd98184	applying a linguistic multi-criteria decision-making model to the analysis of ict suppliers' offers	fuzzy linguistic modelling;multi criteria decision making;analysis of offers;information and communication technologies	Tender analysis processes are everyday processes in any company, but they become even more important when the financial resources are limited. Achieving optimal and transparent tender analysis processes requires hard work from everyone involved. This paper proposes a linguistic multi-criteria decision-making model which helps decision-makers in this task by automating it. To do that, the proposal requires diverse experts to assess different criteria and establish their corresponding weights. The processing of all these input data will determine a minimum value, called profile, to consider an alternative as valid. Additionally, assessments of a similar (probably external) process will be taken into account, becoming a reference valuation. Unlike other decisionmaking models, the use of this last value gives an idea of the goodness of the result depending on whether the solution obtained is close to the reference value. To the best of our knowledge, there is no expert or intelligent system specifically designed to fully meet the needs of tender analysis processes. For both input and output process stages carried out in our proposal, 2-tuple linguistic labels have been used. These linguistic labels were chosen to facilitate decision-making for the staff involved in the process, as well as for being the most suitable communication way used by human beings. To validate the model, we apply it to a case study in the ICT (Information and Communications Technology) sector. In addition, we include a literature review related to applications using the 2-tuple representation, as well as a comparison of our proposal with related methods, including the results obtained by these methods for the case study presented.	artificial intelligence;input/output;value (ethics)	Andres Cid-López;Miguel J.

Though the calculation formulas and tendency analysis of KPIs are given in the standard, it is important to evaluate how the standard performs when implemented in an industrial setting. Based on analyzing the production process in Volvo car, an aggregation KPI evaluation system is proposed to evaluate the operation performance. Two failure KPIs defined in the ISO 22400, mean operation time between failure (MTBF) and mean time to failure (MTTF), are selected in the system. By calculating the failure KPIs in different levels and analyzing the working state of each station in two operating modes, the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed aggregation KPI evaluation system based on the standard is demonstrated.	line level;mean time between failures;operation time;performance evaluation;requirement;robot	Li Zhu;M.

Many existing approaches assume a given static network platform and do not use the network dynamics to facilitate the dynamics of agent interactions. In this paper, we present a decentralized game-theoretic approach to this single coalition emergence problem in which agent communications are limited only to their immediate neighbors. Our coalition emergence algorithm is based on the heuristic that agents benefit by forming coalitions with wealthy (higher payoff) and influential (higher accumulated coupling strength) neighbors. Simulation results show that the emergence phenomenon is significantly enhanced when the topological insights, such as increasing degree-heterogeneity and clustering, are embedded into the agent partner selection strategy.	agent-based model;algorithm;cluster analysis;complex network;coupling constant;embedded system;emergence;game theory;heuristic;interaction;simulation	Mohammad Rashedul Hasan;Anita Raja	2013			game theory;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;scale-free network;management science;emergence	AI	-15.913719249931527	-13.559165873755965	124267

In this paper, we present a general incentive-based method to model AIOS and a game-theoretic approach to inferring AIOS. On one hand, we found that the concept of incentives can unify a large variety of attacker intents; the concept of utilities can integrate incentives and costs in such a way that attacker objectives can be practically modeled. On the other hand, we developed a game-theoretic AIOS formalization which can capture the inherent interdependency between AIOS and defender objectives and strategies in such a way that AIOS can be automatically inferred. Finally, we use a specific case study to show how attack strategies can be inferred in real-world attack--defense scenarios.		Peng Liu;Wanyu Zang;Meng Yu	2005	ACM Trans. Inf. Syst.

When a public event is held in an urban environment like Olympic games or soccer games, it is important to keep the public safe and at the same time, to have a specific plan to control and rescue the public in the case of a terrorist attack. In order to better position public safety in communities against potential threats, it is of utmost importance to identify existing gaps, define priorities and focus on developing approaches to address those. In this paper, we present a system which aims at providing a decision support, threats response planning and risk assessment. Threats can be in the form of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE) weapons and technologies. In order to assess and manage possible risks of such attacks, we have developed a computational framework of simulating terrorist attacks, crowd behaviors, and police or safety guards’ rescue missions. The characteristics of crowd behaviors are modeled based on social science research findings and our own virtual environment experiments with real human participants. Based on gender and age, a person has a different behavioral characteristic. Our framework is based on swarm intelligence and agent-based modeling, which allows us to create a large number of people with specific behavioral characteristics. Different test scenarios can be created by importing or creating 3D urban environments and putting certain terrorist attacks (such as bombs or toxic gas) on specific locations and time-lines.	agent-based model;computation;decision support system;experiment;risk assessment;simulation;swarm intelligence;threat (computer);virtual reality	Andrew J.

We introduce the notion of inconsistent equilibrium to capture those equilibria of the hypergame that are not perceived by at least one player as an equilibrium in her own game. We identify a class of actions, termed exploratory, that a player can take from an inconsistent equilibrium to improve her payoff (even though such actions are perceived to be sanctioned by other players). We analyze the asymptotic convergence properties of the resulting dynamical system and characterize to what extent misperception can be decreased by the use of exploratory actions.	dynamical system;persistence (computer science)	Bahman Gharesifard;Jorge Cortés	2011	2011 49th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/Allerton.2011.6120354	simulation;mathematics;mathematical economics;social psychology;equilibrium selection	Vision	-14.729320071564716	-12.226449397282357	124671

The impacts on production and environment can be mitigated by appropriate management practices like, for instance, the introduction of cover crop in the inter-rows in vineyards. This paper presents the VERDI simulation model created to study various adaptive intercrop management strategies at field scale. The purpose is to design management strategies that are responsive to the water status of the biophysical system (soil e grapevine e intercrop) and the past and current climatic conditions. VERDI realistically reproduces the dynamic interactions between the biophysical system and the decision system in varying Mediterranean rain regime. The decision system works as an interpreter of a management strategy, defined as a set of soil surface management activities (e.g. mechanical weeding of the intercrop) that are linked by temporal constraints (e.g. sequencing, synchronisation) and organisational or programmatic specifications (e.g. iteration). The adaptive capabilities of the strategies are distinguished according to the different sources of flexibility to be exploited at operational, tactical, and strategic levels. A simulation study is reported that involves more or less flexible strategies under different climate scenarios. The simulation results proved that, in case of severe drought, the most flexible strategy yields the best trade-off between agricultural production and environmental services over the years. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

As a direct result of this phenomenon, flood events occur with growing frequency, compared with the past, not only in Central Europe. Local flood management plans are specific documents which methodically instruct responsible people in what procedures to take before, during, and after a flood event. This article deals with the adjustment of local flood management plans in the Czech Republic using geographical information systems (GIS) for enhancing their information value and thus their usefulness. The article compares the systems for creating flood protection documentation at local levels in Scotland and in the Czech Republic. There are substantial differences between these two countries in the extent of the use of geoinformatics in local flood management plans. From this the necessity of adjusting the project documentation on the Czech side, especially its graphical parts, can be inferred. A proposal of specific GIS implementations designed for a case study of the local flood management plan in Hostasovice is a part of this article.	computer graphics;geoinformatics	Petr Vahalík;Premysl Janata	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07926-4_34	mining engineering;geography;civil engineering	Robotics	-15.321996633455514	-22.966234049847696	125466

However, vast majority of existing works just simply presume that agents can offer the discrete choice: either the cooperative (C) or defective (D) strategy, which, to some extent, seems unrealistic in the empirical observations since actual options might be continuous, mixed rather than discrete. Here, we propose discrete, continuous and mixed strategy setups in the social dilemma games and further explore their performance on network populations. Interestingly, it is unveiled that there is actually considerable inconsistency in terms of equilibrium among different strategy games. Furthermore, we reveal how different cooperative arrangements among these three strategy setups can be established, depending on whether the presumed dilemma subclass is a boundary game between prisoner's dilemma game and Chicken game or between prisoner's dilemma game and Stag-Hunt game.

The objective of the paper is twofold: i) investigating the role of social conventions in coordination problem situations, and more specifically in congestion games; ii) comparing simulation-based and analytical results to figure out what these methodologies can tell us on the subject matter. Our main issue is that Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) and the Equation-Based Modelling (EBM) are not alternative, but in some circumstances complementary, and suggest some features distinguishing these two ways of modeling that go beyond the practical considerations provided by Parunak H.V.D., Robert Savit and Rick L. Riolo. Our model is based on the interaction of strategies of heterogeneous agents who have to cross a junction. In each junction there are only four inputs, each of which is passable only in the direction of the intersection and can be occupied only by an agent one at a time. The results generated by ABM simulations provide structured data for developing the analytical model through which generalizing the simulation results and make predictions. ABM simulations are artifacts that generate empirical data on the basis of the variables, properties, local rules and critical factors the modeler decides to implement into the model; in this way simulations allow generating controlled data, useful to test the theory and reduce the complexity, while EBM allows to close them, making thus possible to falsify them.	agent-based model;artifact (software development);bellman equation;emergence;interaction;network congestion;simulation;subject matter expert turing test	Federico Cecconi;Marco Campennì;Giulia Andrighetto;Rosaria Conte	2010	J.

During the allocation process, many factors have to be considered. Some of these factors can be measured quantitatively while others have to be assessed qualitatively. In this paper, we consider seven criteria for conducting reliability allocation. A comprehensive failure rate allocation method is proposed for conducting the task of reliability allocation.

These companies can cooperate with partners to share resources, competences, risks or costs. Besides, penetrating new markets can be easier when associating new partners. The selection process of an adequate partner considered for a specific objective is a key success factor. This paper proposes an evaluation methodology for selecting an alliance partner in the case of a network of enterprises, manufacturing high precision mechanical components. An This is a preprint of an article submitted for consideration in Int. Journal of Applied Logistics 2012 extensive group decision methodology is developed using both quantitative data and qualitative judgments in the evaluation of criteria. Since some performances cannot be represented with crisp numbers, the proposed methodology allows experts to use linguistic variables to express their judgments for the assessment of qualitative criteria. Two main phases are integrated in this methodology. In the first phase, criteria and experts weightings are calculated to determine the criteria importance using fuzzy the Analytical Hierarchy Process. In the second phase, a Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution is proposed to rank the different alternatives, corresponding to the alternative partnerships.	analytical hierarchy;logistics;performance;selection algorithm	Selin Soner Kara;Omar Ayadi;Naoufel Cheikhrouhou	2012	IJAL	10.4018/jal.2012010101	analytic hierarchy process;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;management science;management	AI	-5.5524858409408315	-17.214748953405334	125762

Using an agent-based model based on very simple game-theoretic assumptions, we build a toy model involving donation games over a population. We considered two different variations of a strategy (individually focused and social group focused) and observed drastic differences at the collective level between each. Stable trust patterns were not evolvable in our model with completely social agents. Individually-oriented agents were required. But when trust patterns were able to form among the group-focused agents, large cliques tended to form, contrary to the individually-oriented agents.		Bahareh Esfahbod;Kurt Kreuger;Nathaniel D.

It is necessary to identify the key factors affecting urban regeneration and then construct an urban regeneration decision-making evaluation system to provide a basis for objective and comprehensive judgment for urban regeneration decision-making. Through constructing a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model based on the entropy weight method, this paper attempts to provide a scientific evaluation method for the suitability of urban regeneration. An urban regeneration scheduling method by sorting the appropriate degree of the update of different areas in the large region, is proposed to achieve urban regeneration implementation in the sequence of time and space optimization.	mathematical optimization;relocation (computing);scheduling (computing);sorting;ur, ur/web	Tao Zhou;Yulin Zhou	2015	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-151969	machine learning;mathematics;fuzzy logic;management science;artificial intelligence;stakeholder;china;peninsula;sorting	HCI	-9.304119627365598	-21.181147384404408	126407

By applying this method, a case study of typical images of the Grain Rain, which is one of the 24 solar terms in Chinese traditional calendar was carried out. The method is as follows: looking for the typical images of the Grain Rain through literature review and social investigation, then taking pictures in the field. Using octree combined with least-significant difference method (octree-LSD method) to original colors, after that, several colors were picked of each image and the degree of beauty of them was also calculated according to the M•Spenser’s aesthetic measurement. Only if it comes out that these colors will be qualified on the aspect of aesthetic when combining together, will the next step be carried out which is adopting Munsell Color Harmony Theory to determine the area ratio of each color and gain the color scheme. Last but not the least, using the Semantic Difference method in Kansei engineering to measure the color emotion of each color scheme, then color schemes which will be able to represent the Grain Rain and the application situation of them would be obtained. This method combines scientific calculation methods, western scientific color systems and empirical subjective opinions, which insure that the color schemes obtained by this method can not only be valid but also consistent with people’s cognition.

It is a key response to global environmental change in addition to being both a key cause and medium of this change. This article examines an application of the Southern Yucatán Peninsular Region Integrated Assessment (SYPRIA), a scenario-based spatially explicit model designed to examine and project land use in Mexico. SYPRIA combines Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with agent-based modeling, cellular modeling, and genetic programming. The application examined here explores the effects on land-use and land-cover projections of scenarios that rely on varying assumptions pertaining to population growth, land-use trends, role of agrarian technology, and effects of resource institutions. This work also highlights the importance of understanding the many factors influencing land use, particularly population, different production systems, and the contextual nature of resource institutions in determining the nature of land use. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The customization of housing, however, requires intensive communication between the customer and the supplier, as well as complicated processes in design and construction phases. Non-professional customers' inability to analyze the cost and quality of customization may produce difficulty in decision making and discrepancies between expectation and result, which will eventually give rise to dissatisfaction with the service and the product. This paper presents a system to support decision making in housing customization using a hybrid approach combining case-based reasoning (CBR) and genetic algorithm (GA). With this system, a customer is able to participate in the design process by customizing the house according to one's preferred layout, finishing and budget without time-consuming communication with professional designers. The paper concludes that the method should make customization efficient and profitable when applied to pre-sale housing in Taiwan.	case-based reasoning;genetic algorithm	Yi-Kai Juan;Shen-Guan Shih;Yeng-Horng Perng	2006	Expert Syst.

It can powerfully advance a distinctive approach to social science. In this paper, by applying the ACE idea, a group behaviour evolution model is built in order to directly study the emergence of organisation behaviour from individual interactions. This model shows the effect of the interactions among behaviour agents on the size and maximum benefits of the firm. Firstly, through analysing the organisation behaviour, the based-agent group behaviour evolution model is provided, and the modelling method and the internal architecture are described in detail. Then, the local details and implementations of the model are shown. Finally, the simulation results explain how the micro-individual interactions affect the macro-organisation behaviours, and the analysis of the simulation results show that infinite expansion of the firm size could lead to profit shrinkage. In the summary, the paper briefly summarises the research contents and significance, and further illustrates that paying attention to the micro level of a general behaviour, the complex phenomena may emerge from a set of given rules in a simulation. Moreover, the direction of further research is brought forward.	ace;agent-based computational economics;agent-based model;complex system;computation;emergence;emergentism;intelligent agent;interaction;simulation	Zhentao Shi;Jianchao Zeng;Zhihua Cui	2012	IJCSE	10.1504/IJCSE.2012.048092	simulation;artificial intelligence;operations research	AI	-17.33596345435435	-15.279106663988962	127026
8e9af0964a48e5b750bb2aa9aec816e8c8a4216f	growing networks through random walks without restarts		Network growth and evolution is a fundamental theme that has puzzled scientists for the past decades. A number of models have been proposed to capture important properties of real networks. In an attempt to better describe reality, more recent growth models embody local rules of attachment, however they still require a primitive to randomly select an existing network node and then some kind of global knowledge about the network (at least the set of nodes and how to reach them). We propose a purely local network growth model that makes no use of global sampling across the nodes. The model is based on a continuously moving random walk that after s steps connects a new node to its current location, but never restarts. Through extensive simulations and theoretical arguments, we analyze the behavior of the model finding a fundamental dependency on the parity of s, where networks with either exponential or a conditional power law degree distribution can emerge. As s increases parity dependency diminishes and the model recovers the degree distribution of Barabási-Albert preferential attachment model. The proposed purely local model indicates that networks can grow to exhibit interesting properties even in the absence of any global rule, such as global node sampling.	attachments;degree distribution;population dynamics;randomness;sampling (signal processing);simulation;time complexity	Bernardo Amorim;Daniel R.

The simulations are based on a model that integrates the language game model with the iterated learning model. The simulations show that compositional structures tend to emerge more extensively for larger groups, which has a positive effect on the time in which the languages develop and on communicative success, which may even have an optimal group size. A mathematical analysis of the time of convergence is presented that provides an approximate explanation of the results. The paper concludes that increasing group sizes among humans could not only have triggered the origins of language, but also facilitated the evolution of more complex languages.	approximation algorithm;computer simulation;emergence;iteration;regular expression;vergence	Paul Vogt	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74913-4_41	computer simulation;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;size of groups, organizations, and communities;machine learning	PL	-15.311005365482734	-14.657667557696755	127206

The OICR index for the world's major oil-importing countries against 17 major oil-producing countries is calculated and analyzed, and then some suggestions about China's oil importing strategy are given.	entropic uncertainty	Wan He;Xiaolei Sun;Ling Tang;Jianping Li	2009	2009 International Joint Conference on Computational Sciences and Optimization	10.1109/CSO.2009.78	economics;risk management;computer science;petroleum industry;systematics;economy;petroleum;correlation;economic growth;china;commerce	EDA	-10.343811717378026	-21.67478449889025	127320

Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the decisions may be uncertain due to the unknown system state and the uncontrollable externality. The uncertainty can be eliminated through learning from information sources, such as user-generated contents or revealed actions. Nevertheless, the user-generated contents could be untrustworthy since other agents may maliciously create misleading contents for their selfish interests. The passively revealed actions are potentially more trustworthy and also easier to be gathered through simple observations. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic game-theoretic framework, Hidden Chinese Restaurant Game (H-CRG), to utilize the passively revealed actions in stochastic social learning process. We propose grand information extraction, a novel Bayesian belief extraction process, to extract the belief on the hidden information directly from the observed actions. We utilize the coupling relation between belief and policy to transform the original continuous belief-state Markov decision process (MDP) into a discrete-state MDP. The optimal policy is then analyzed in both centralized and game-theoretic approaches. We demonstrate how the proposed H-CRG can be applied to the channel access problem in cognitive radio networks. We then conduct data-driven simulations using the CRAWDAD Dartmouth campus wireless local area network (WLAN) trace. The simulation results show that the equilibrium strategy derived in H-CRG provides higher expected utilities for new users and maintains a reasonable high social welfare comparing with other candidate strategies.	centralized computing;classification research group;cognitive radio;game theory;information extraction;information source;markov chain;nash equilibrium;partially observable markov decision process;queueing theory;simulation;trust (emotion);user-generated content	Chih-Yu Wang;Yan Chen;K.

Those studies generally consider models in which nodes are independently active according to the same random timing process, and vary that timing. In reality, people differ widely in the patterns of their activity. In this paper, we develop a simple model of diffusion on networks in which agents can differ in the autocorrelation of their activity patterns. We show that bursty behavior does not always hurt the diffusion, and depending on the features of the environment, having some (but not all) of the population being bursty significantly helps diffusion. Moreover, we prove that in a variety of settings maximizing diffusion requires heterogeneous activity patterns across agents and does not involve any Poisson behavior.	autocorrelation;interaction;social network	Mohammad Akbarpour;Matthew O.

The emergent and self-organizing behaviours seen in many such distributed systems are closely congruent to the phenomenon of collective intelligence. Emergence and self-organization often occur together and appear to be subsumed within a broader framework of collective intelligence in distributed systems. Collective intelligence, the ability of a group to exhibit greater intelligence than its individual members, is result of various distributed interaction mechanisms, which are quite similar to the so-far identified mechanisms and underlying structures of emergence and self-organization. This paper presents a short analytical survey of the concepts and characteristic properties of emergence, self-organization and collective intelligence and tries to establish the strong similarity and inter-relatedness in them. The complex non-linear dynamics found in systems exhibiting these properties is not reducible to individual parts and therefore require a generative modeling approach of analysis. The Agent-based modeling and simulation approach seems the most suitable choice, as is also demonstrated through an example of agent-based simulation of obstacle handling in a collective setting.	agent-based model;causality;collective intelligence;distributed computing;dynamical system;emergence;feedback;generative modelling language;interaction;noise shaping;nonlinear system;obstacle avoidance;organizational behavior;organizing (structure);self-organization;simulation;social system	Vivek Kumar Singh;Garima Singh;Suparna Pande	2013	2013 UKSim 15th International Conference on Computer Modelling and Simulation	10.1109/UKSim.2013.77	psychology;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;social psychology;agent-based social simulation	AI	-19.004914658716398	-15.862231959993016	127852
09fc3d22726d7b6fdae5b4dfd5191fa0be3d33b6	measuring performance in transportation companies in developing countries: a novel rough aras model		The success of any business depends fundamentally on the possibility of balancing (symmetry) needs and their satisfaction, that is, the ability to properly define a set of success indicators. It is necessary to continuously monitor and measure the indicators that have the greatest impact on the achievement of previously set goals. Regarding transportation companies, the rationalization of transportation activities and processes plays an important role in ensuring business efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, a model for evaluating performance indicators has been developed and implemented in three different countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Libya and Serbia. The model consists of five phases, of which the greatest contribution is the development of a novel rough additive ratio assessment (ARAS) approach for evaluating measured performance indicators in transportation companies. The evaluation was carried out in the territories of the aforementioned countries in a total of nine companies that were evaluated on the basis of 20 performance indicators. The results obtained were verified throughout a three-phase procedure of a sensitivity analysis. The significance of the performance indicators was simulated throughout the formation of 10 scenarios in the sensitivity analysis. In addition, the following approaches were applied: rough WASPAS (weighted aggregated sum product assessment), rough SAW (simple additive weighting), rough MABAC (multi-attributive border approximation area comparison) and rough EDAS (evaluation based on distance from average solution), which showed high correlation of ranks by applying Spearman’s correlation coefficient (SCC).	apple a5;apple a7;apple a9;approximation;benchmark (computing);bridging (networking);coefficient;competitive analysis (online algorithm);computer performance;decision problem;gene ontology term enrichment;logistics;multiplication sign;rough set;scalar processor;set theory;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods;vagueness	Dunja Radovic;Zeljko Stevic;Dragan Pamucar;Edmundas Kazimieras Zavadskas;Ibrahim A.

5ac5feee7fd934981aedf6d4cd40024c0c34a2b0	evaluating the perception of the decision quality in web-based group decision support systems: a theory of satisfaction		The future and success of organizations depend greatly on the quality of every decision made. It is known that most of the decisions in organizations are made in group. With the purpose to support the decision-makers anytime and anywhere, Web-based Group Decision Support Systems have been studied. The amount of Web-based Group Decision Support Systems incorporating automatic negotiation mechanisms such as argumentation is increasing nowadays. Usually, these systems/models are evaluated through mathematical proofs, number of rounds or seconds to propose (reach) a solution. However, those techniques do not say much in terms of decision quality. Here, we propose a model to predict the decision-makers’ satisfaction (perception of the decision quality), specially designed to deal with multi-criteria problems. Our model considers aspects such as: alternatives comparison, style of behaviour, emotions, mood and expectations. The proposed formulation matches the assumptions previously defined in the literature.

However, it is difficult to study the input-output relations in these models because of the numerous parameters as well as the complicated model structure. Model elicitation can be considered as an approximate study of the significant effects of the model without spending excessive time in multiple replications of discrete event simulation. In this paper, Analytic Network Process (ANP) is applied to model elicitation in large-scale nation-building models. It can be used to study the factor significance and the inter-influence among different kinds of factors. This new approach is strictly based on the quantitative analysis instead of the expert knowledge, which greatly improves the traditional ANP method that uses possibly conflicting human expertise. The numeric results show that this methodology provides good solutions at significantly reduced computational time compared with traditional discrete-event simulations.	approximation algorithm;computation;graph theory;interdependence;level of detail;numerical analysis;simulation;time complexity	Rakesh Nagi;Moises Sudit	2009	2009 12th International Conference on Information Fusion		simulation;computer science;operations management;management science	Visualization	-8.539167981524649	-11.531362718659853	128373

These alternatives are evaluated with respect to their 10 spatial arrangement. A geographic information system-based methodology in conjunction 11 with the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was used to evaluate alternative site 12 suitability to identify priority sites for seismic stations setting up. Comprehensive 13 analyses were conducted in order to identify the best location for seismic stations based 14 on given criteria. By considering the environmental objectives and the economical 15 feasibility, the criteria were developed in the GIS environment then individual 16 satisfaction degrees for each alternative location are calculated using weighted overlay 17 tool. By selecting appropriate weights, the MCDA provides effective tools for seismic 18 station site suitability that may serve to improve the performance and capabilities of 19 seismic networks. Several alternative comparisons were carried out to evaluate the 20 confidence in the model and helped in the priority areas refinements. 21 The application of this method in Harrat Al-Madinah volcanic field, Saudi Arabia, 22 provided a suitability map for the area.

Several taxonomies for human errors and methodologies for human reliability analysis (HRA) have been proposed in the literature. Generally, human errors have been modeled on the basis of probabilistic concepts with or without the consideration of cognitive aspects of human behaviors. Modeling of human errors through probabilistic approaches has shown a limitation on quantification of qualitative aspects of human errors and complexity of attributes from circumstances involved. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the methodologies for human reliability analysis and introduce a fuzzy logic approach to the evaluation of human interacting system's reliability. Fuzzy approach could be used to estimate human error effects under ambiguous interacting environments and assist in the design of error free work environments.	fuzzy logic;human error;human reliability;reliability engineering	B.

Discriminating between these efficient DMUs is an interesting subject, and a large number of methods have been proposed for fully ranking both efficient and inefficient DMUs. This paper demonstrates the fact that the rank reversal phenomenon may occur in most DEA ranking methods; however, this study introduces some ranking methods which do not follow the procedure and lack this taint. Numerical examples are provided to clearly illustrate the above mentioned phenomenon in some DEA ranking methods. In fact, certain ranking methods are surveyed in DEA focusing on rank preservation and rank reversal phenomena.	data envelopment analysis;digital mockup;ranking (information retrieval)	Mehdi Soltanifar;Saeid Shahghobadi	2014	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2013.12.021	computer science;data mining;rank reversals in decision-making;data envelopment analysis;statistics	AI	-5.156174655337272	-20.330559688155553	129251

The basic toll for formalization. analysis, and modeling is a quasi-chaotic model of computations, the Random PROLOG Processor (RPP). In the RPP. Clause-Molecules (CM) of facts, ales, goals, or higher-level logical structures enclosed by membranes move quasi-randomly in s@uctu& Computational-PROLOG-Space (C’S). When CM rendezvous in CS, an inference process can occur if and only if the logical conditions are h~lfXed. It is proposed in this theory that Collective Intelligence can be measured as follows: I) the mapping is done of a given social structure of beings into the RPP; 2) the beings and their behavior are tram&ed intO PROLOG expressions, carried by CMs; 3) the goal(s) of the social structure is(are) lranslatal into N-Element infere~es (.VEI); 4) the eficiency of the NEI is evaluated and given as the !ntelligence Quotient of a &ciai Structure (I@) projad onto NEI. Since fQS is computed as a probability function over time. them are various possibilities, eg.: to order social structures according to their IQS. to optimize social structures with IQS as a quality measure, or even to compare single beings with social structures. The use of probability allows estimation of IQS either by simulation, or on the basis of analytical calculations. I.BASICCONCEPTSOFMODELING COLLEC~IVE~NTELLIGENCE It is a paradox that the evaluation of the Collective Intelligence of social structures can be easier than the et aluation of the IQ of a single being, Individual intelligence has only been evaluated on the basis of external results of behavior during a problemsolving process in real life or during IQ tests. Neuropsychological processes accompanying problemsolving in the brain are still very far fkom being observable [2]. As a result, it is necessary to create abstract models of brain activity based on neuropsychological hypotheses (e.g. Luria [2j). or to use computer+riented models like Artificial Intelligence.

We also try to recognize the main reasons which caused these deterioration problems. Methods: To do this, we first conceptualize eleven physical-spatial factors. These factors have been analyzed using fuzzy logic and IHPW Inverse Hierarchy Process Weight within GIS. Results and conclusions: Results of the model which has been applied on the city of Zanjan's old fabric illustrate that a fuzzy approach is a basic tool to identify vulnerability. Its application to the problem helps to unify relevant theory and practice. It also generated maps of vulnerable spots that can be more adaptable to changes and can greatly assist planners and policy makers in decision-making.	fuzzy logic;geographic information system;iranian.com	Abolfazl Meshkini;Kyoumars Habibi;Hooshmand Alizadeh	2013	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-120698	fuzzy logic;geomatics;vulnerability;computer science;artificial intelligence	Robotics	-10.836049347802712	-22.885832872807367	129508

The DRSD considers multiple sectors within a general decision-support framework to generate cross-sector optimal development schemes at a county scale. It integrates a dynamic database system, large-scale linear programming for regional managers, and integer linear programming for farmers, which makes a solid step toward linking farmers' microplanning with administrators' macropolicies. Yongxin, an economically relatively undeveloped and geographically relatively isolated county, was chosen as the paradigm for this DRSD application; this selection provided a good opportunity to analyze the relationships between rapid economic development, ecological destruction, and environmental deterioration within the region. The results from the representative scenario, Sustainable Development, suggested that maximization of overall economic benefits for 23 towns in Yongxin over a 15-year period, from 2007 to 2022 would require relatively small increases in agricultural and horticultural areas, significant increases in scales of livestock, poultry, sericulture, forestry, and fisheries, as well as significant increases in investment in both the secondary and the tertiary industry sectors. Future directions and implementation challenges for this type of DSS were discussed.	decision support system;environmental resource management	Guo H.

In this work we universalize reputation through the use of values found within all virtual and agent societies. The following values are manifested within a society of agents: responsibility, honesty, independence, obedience, ambition, helpfulness, capability, knowledgability, and cost-efficiency. Manifestations of these values lead to a more universalized approach to formalizing reputation.#R##N##R##N#This new model of trust is examined within the context of an e-commerce framework. The e-commerce based multiagent system is comprised of buyers and sellers that wish to conduct business. Sellers can engage in untrustworthy business behavior at the buyer's expense. It is the job of the model to decide whether a selling agent is trustworthy enough to engage in business. The trust model is analyzed with respect to stability, scalability, accuracy in attaining e-commerce objectives, and general effectiveness in discouraging untrustworthy behavior.#R##N##R##N#Based on the experiments, the model is scalable and stable dependent upon the agent population of buyers and sellers. It achieves its primary objective of discouraging untrustworthy behavior as measured through the acceleration of Gross Domestic Product growth over time. Within the simulator, a high degree of random outcomes is possible. Stability is used to examine the predictability of the model (on average) given a fixed set of given data about the simulations.

6141b3fb59704df22c978a4811c4bf03520bc283	dynamic identity model for agents		Our identity plays an important role in our lives. It regulates our thoughts, feelings and behaviours. For that reason researchers have been focusing on identity and the way it can impact an agent’s processes in order make them more believable. Because identity is dynamic, people’s behaviours will differ according to different contexts. The presence of others as well as several other social context’s factors have an effect on the way someone is going to perceive oneself. Whether as part of a group with shared interests among its members, or as unique and distinctive individual, the perception of group membership is going to determine if one’s behaviour is going to be influenced by one’s social identity or personal identity. When a social identity is salient, people tend to cooperate more with members of their group, even when the group’s goals differ from their own personal goals. Due to that impact, we believe that a dynamic identity is especially important if the aim is to build believable agents with the ability to adjust their decisions to the social context they are in. In this paper, we present a Dynamic Identity Model for Agents that provides agents with an adaptive identity and behaviour that is adjustable to the social context.

That is to say, an appropriate sales manager is able to improve communication and provide necessary services for customers. Thus, sale ability of an enterprise will be increased by appropriate sales managers. To select appropriate sales managers easily and quickly, we utilize a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making(FMCDM) method called fuzzy TOPSIS to solve the selection problem in enterprises. Fuzzy TOPSIS is an extension of TOPSIS under fuzzy environment, and TOPSIS is one of famous multi-criteria decision-making(MCDM) methods under certain environment. By fuzzy TOPSIS, an optimal sales manager is easily found from lots of candidates. Besides, selection criteria of the FMCDM method will be also evaluation standards of sales managers' ability after worked in the enterprise.

95be42b161072492708f174a6005b81c6ef0418b	regret minimization algorithms for the followers behaviour identification in leadership games		We study for the first time, a leadership game in which one agent, acting as leader, faces another agent, acting as follower, whose behaviour is not known a priori by the leader, being one among a set of possible behavioural profiles. The main motivation is that in real-world applications the common game-theoretical assumption of perfect rationality is rarely met, and any specific assumption on bounded rationality models, if wrong, could lead to a significant loss for the leader. The question we pose is whether and how the leader can learn the behavioural profile of a follower in leadership games. This is a “natural” online identification problem: in fact, the leader aims at identifying the follower’s behavioural profile to exploit at best the potential non-rationality of the opponent, while minimizing the regret due to the initial lack of information. We propose two algorithms based on different approaches and we provide a regret analysis. Furthermore, we experimentally evaluate the pseudo-regret of the algorithms in concrete leadership games, showing that our algorithms outperform the online learning algorithms available in the state of the art.	algorithm;bridging (networking);concrete security;empirical risk minimization;experiment;feedback;iteration;machine learning;markov decision process;multi-agent system;pose (computer vision);rationality;regret (decision theory)	Lorenzo Bisi;Giuseppe De Nittis;Francesco Trovò;Marcello Restelli;Nicola Gatti	2017			mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;computer science;machine learning;minification;regret	AI	-14.609012110935046	-11.093611903635285	130135

However, far fewer have been used in practice. Sometimes it is assumed that an accurate prediction is enough for useful decision support but this neglects the importance of trust: a user who does not trust a tool will not accept its advice. Giving users an explanation of the way a BN reasons may make its predictions easier to trust. In this study, we propose a progressive explanation of inference that can be applied to any hybrid BN. The key questions that we answer are: which important evidence supports or contradicts the prediction and through which intermediate variables does the evidence flow. The explanation is illustrated using different scenarios in a BN designed for medical decision support.	bayesian network;decision support system	Evangelia Kyrimi;William Marsh	2016			computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining	AI	-12.45051534107901	-13.174219122280862	130149

In many cases, the deployment of an offshore wind farm leads to public opposition. This entails the need for the development of appropriate methods that might present in the most intelligible way the impacts of an offshore wind farm. Amongst many factors to take into account, the visual impact of such farms is surely a factor to take into account. We introduce a visual operator that integrates several parameters that mainly depend on the distance of the wind farm to the cost. We apply a measure that evaluates the horizon surface impact modulated by the number of distinguishable turbines and an aesthetic index based on turbine alignments. The whole method is implemented on top of a Geographical Information System (GIS) and provides a decision-aid mechanism oriented to decision-makers. The whole approach is experimented in the context of a wind farm in North West France.

Generalization performance of learning agents depends onthe training experience to which they have been exposed. In game-playing domains, that experience is determined by the opponents facedduring learning. This analytical study investigates two characteristics ofopponents in competitive coevolutionary learning: behavioral diversityand diﬃculty (performance against other players). To assess diversity, wepropose a generic intra-game behavioral distance measure, that could beadopted to other sequential decision problems. We monitor both charac-teristics in two-population coevolutionary learning of Othello strategies,attempting to explain their relationship with the generalization perfor-mance achieved by the evolved solutions. The main observation is theexistence of a non-obvious trade-oﬀ between diﬃculty and diversity, withthe latter being essential for obtaining high generalization performance.Keywords: Behavioral diversity		Marcin Grzegorz Szubert;Wojciech Jaskowski;Pawel Liskowski;Krzysztof Krawiec	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-16549-3_32	psychology;artificial intelligence;machine learning;social psychology	ECom	-14.69064714471422	-13.239447232389141	130962

Managers need to examine every possibility that can occur during the life span of their new product and focus on the right strategy. Even then, launching a new product is highly risky due to uncertainties of the market and competitors. This study presents a proposal of real option evaluation through fuzzy logic for a new product development project in a retail banking market with Type-2 fuzzy sets. A multi-stage new product development is used to have a better understanding of the long term success of the project. One of the real options evaluation technique is binomial lattice model. This technique is mostly suitable for managerial flexibility decisions.

The key innovation of our method is a secure runtime definition and solution of the game and real-time use of game solutions for immediate system reconfiguration. Our approach is suited for realistic environments where we typically lack any ground truth information regarding traffic legitimacy/maliciousness and where the significant portion of system inputs may be shaped by the attacker in order to render the system ineffective. Therefore, we rely on the concept of challenge insertion: we inject a small sample of simulated attacks into the unknown traffic and use the system response to these attacks to define the game structure and utility functions. This approach is also advantageous from the security perspective, as the manipulation of the adaptive process by the attacker is far more difficult.

1d7def1c0b6de980b42c115eea2b84fbec7c61fe	towards a framework for agent-based simulation of user behaviour in e-commerce context		In order to increase sales and profits, it is common that e-commerce website owners resort to several marketing and advertising techniques, attempting to influence user actions. Summarizing and analysing user behaviour is a complex task since it is hard to extrapolate patterns that never occurred before and the causality aspects of the system are not usually taken into consideration. There has been studies about characterizing user behaviour and interactions in e-commerce websites that could be used to improve this process. This paper presents an agent-based framework for simulating models of user behaviour created through data mining processes within an e-commerce context. The purpose of framework is to study the reaction of user to stimuli that influence their actions while navigating the website. Furthermore a scalability analysis is performed on a case-study.	e-commerce;simulation	Duarte Duarte;Hugo Sereno Ferreira;João Pedro Dias;Zafeiris Kokkinogenis	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-61578-3_3	e-commerce;causality;scalability;marketing;business	AI	-10.19107360508199	-11.041324485828559	131739

However, this field of research is now more focused on reducing territorial vulnerability. This requires prior accurate knowledge of this territorial vulnerability. The present work, applicable to any location, proposes a GIS-based methodology for vulnerability assessment using the greater Lyon, France, as a model. The study is based on a spatial decision-making method that awards priority to vulnerability using expert judgments. Vulnerability is defined as the combination of the sensitivity of assets facing hazards and their strategic importance in the functioning of a city. This approach can be applied to multiple layers of hazards for a specific envisioned risk.

However, in most previous work, each agent can only adapt the relations by itself. This may induce a problem that the overloaded agents have to consume a fraction of precious load on adaptation. Here, we propose a novel self-organizing mechanism which enables some underloaded agents to act as the intermediary to perform the relation adaptation for the overloaded agents. Through experiments, our self-organizing mechanism has validated the effectiveness.	multi-agent system;organizing (structure)	Mengzhu Zhang;Yifeng Zhou;Yichuan Jiang	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-13191-7_3	computer science;self-organization;distributed computing;multi-agent system	AI	-16.76372471383333	-10.927411077314375	132988

Three scales of networks are considered: a global ‘policy’ network promoting specific land uses, an intermediate ‘social’ network where land use practices are shared and promoted collectively and a local ‘neighborhood’ network where land use practices are influenced by those of their neighbors. We assess the respective and combined influence of these networks on landscape pattern (fragmentation and heterogeneity) and dynamics, taking into account agronomic constraints (assimilated to crop successions). Simulations show that combination of incentive networks does not have linear and/or cumulative influence on landscape changes. Comparison of simulated scenarios highlights that a combination of two networks tends to improve landscape heterogeneity and fragmentation; scenarios combining all networks could lead to two opposite landscape configuration illustrating emergence of landscape dynamics. Finally, this study emphasizes that landscape complexity has also to be understood through the multiplicity of pathways of landscape changes rather than the assessment of the resulting landscape patterns.	agent-based model;agent-based social simulation;computer simulation;emergence;fragmentation (computing);social network	S.

This approach, referred to as anomaly detection, has enjoyed immense popularity because of its effectiveness at recognizing unknown attacks (under the assumption that attacks cause glitches in the protected system). Typically, instead of building a single complex model, smaller, partial models are constructed, each capturing different features of the monitored activity. Such multimodel paradigm raises the non-trivial issue of combining each partial model to decide whether or not the activity contains signs of attacks. Various mechanisms can be chosen, ranging from a simple weighted average to Bayesian networks, or more sophisticated strategies. In this paper we show how different aggregation functions can influence the detection accuracy. To mitigate these issues we propose a radically different approach: rather than treating the aggregation as a calculation, we formulate it as a decision problem, implemented through cooperative negotiation between autonomous agents. We validated the approach on a publicly available, realistic dataset, and show that it enhances the detection accuracy with respect to a system that uses elementary aggregation mechanisms.	agent-based model;aggregate function;anomaly detection;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;autonomous robot;bayesian network;decision problem;fits;glitch;mathematical model;multi-agent system;object composition;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;protection mechanism	Alberto Volpatto;Federico Maggi;Stefano Zanero	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-17197-0_12	simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;data mining	AI	-12.86480292469036	-11.552126534945044	134106

It is proved that specific types of reciprocity norm lead individuals to split into two groups. The condition for the evolutionary stability of the norms is also revealed. This result suggests a connection between group formation and a specific type of reciprocity norm in our society. Cooperative behavior can be observed widely in our society. An important aspect of cooperation is that people can maintain mutual cooperation even if they are faced with social dilemma, which means the situation that people fail to cooperate although entire cooperation gives better payoff to everyone. Several mechanisms are pointed out to be important to overcome the social dilemma, and reciprocity is one of them [1]. Especially indirect reciprocity (cooperation to someone enhance his probability to have a cooperative response from others) is a key when partners of interaction are flexible [3]. It is necessary for this mechanism to work that people monitor what others do to others and appropriately judge whom they should cooperate with. Otherwise free riding behavior spreads and cooperation is abandoned. Another important aspect of cooperation is that people are generally not equally cooperative to all people. Especially, they often form several groups and cooperate only inside of the groups, which is called in-group favoritism [2]. To understand in-group favoritism, one can assume a given group structure and study how cooperation is sustained only inside of the groups [4–6]. In some cases, however, the group structure itself can be formed by social interaction of people. For example, groups of friends or business partners are hardly decided a priori. Therefore a model to explain in-group favoritism without exogenous group structure is required. Here, we study whether group structure of cooperation is spontaneously formed in a model of indirect reciprocity with private assessment: each person can have different opinions on the others' reputation. Private assessment model itself has been studied in previous works [7–10]. However their main attention was not the emergence of group structure but what definition of goodness can evolutionary promote cooperation. In this paper, on the other hand, the structure of the cooperative relation of the main interest. We consider well-mixed N players playing a game, which is called donation game. The number of players is assumed to be large, N ≫ 1. The game is repeated over a large number of rounds.

However, there has been limited progress in bringing environmental planning into the sphere of urban systems planning. This situation can be largely attributed to the absence of advanced integrated land use– transport–environment modelling tools capable of analysing the behaviour of complex, dynamic systems. This paper describes an initial attempt to develop a framework for integrating land use, transport and airshed models for evaluating the effect of city form on air quality. The framework identifies the relationship between various components such as the GIS database, the land use–transport–environment module and the airshed model. Issues concerning the structure and robustness of the framework are discussed and results from a recent air quality inquiry are presented.		Leorey O. Marquez;Nariida C.

134358b5fed3ce7cb5db4d461ac91bf1c06bbfd4	robustness of the critical behaviour in the stochastic greenberg-hastings cellular automaton model		We study a stochastic version of the Greenberg-Hastings cellular automaton, a simple model of wave propagation in reaction-diffusion media. Despite its apparent simplicity, its global dynamics displays various complex behaviours. Here, we investigate the influence of temporary or definitive failures of the cells of the grid. We show that a continuous decrease of the probability of excitation of cells triggers a drastic change of behaviour, driving the system from an “active” to an “extinct” steady state. Simulations show that this phenomenon is a nonequilibrium phase transition that belongs to directed percolation universality class. Observations show an amazing robustness of the critical behaviour with regard to topological perturbations: not only is the phase transition occurrence preserved, but its universality class remains directed percolation. We also demonstrate that the position of the critical threshold can be easily predicted as it decreases linearly with the inverse of the average number of neighbours per cell.	bernard greenberg;directed percolation;greenberg–hastings cellular automaton;simulation preorder;software propagation;steady state;universality probability	Hugues Berry;Nazim Fatès	2011	IJUC		discrete mathematics;steady state;mathematics;wave propagation;phase transition;directed percolation;percolation;non-equilibrium thermodynamics;renormalization group;greenberg–hastings cellular automaton	Metrics	-14.067337996337942	-17.103881241815717	134624

60f3e0e2279a5f6d4d274cebbdb73eda0ff39596	promotion of cooperation based on swarm intelligence in spatial public goods games		In this paper, we introduce the swarm intelligence methods into the evolutionary dynamics, and have studied the impact of swarm intelligent algorithm on the evolution of cooperation among selfish individuals in the continuous version of spatial public goods games (PGG). We update an individual’s strategy according to the memory which records the most successful individual strategy in the past (referred to as its personal best strategy) as well as the knowledge of the best current strategy found by its nearest neighbors (referred to as the neighborhood best strategy). Through extensive simulations, we find that the introduction of swarm intelligence into PGG can promote cooperation strongly. Other pertinent quantities such as the time evolution of cooperator density, the spatial distribution of strategies and the updated velocities are also investigated. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

There are many studies on lodging resistance of maize varieties now, but information about maize planting environment lodging stress is very rare. The environment lodging stress, which is a result of various factors, is characterized by uncertainty. Fuzzy sets theory and fuzzy logic are advantageous for dealing with the questions with uncertainties. The objective of this study is to assess the environment lodging stress for maize planting. Based on the daily weather data in the recent 59 years (1951–2009) and soil data, five counties (or cities) in ShanDong Province and HeNan Province in Huang-Huai-Hai-Plain, China, are selected as study sites; the maximum wind speed, rainfall, and potassium content in soil are chosen as stress indicators, and the overall stress level of each study site is obtained by a fuzzy synthetic evaluation approach. The consistency is shown between our calculation results and the results obtained with actual survey data on lodging in maize, indicating that the employed model is a promising approach for assessing environment lodging stress, and providing a scientific basis for maize variety extension and recommendation and comprehensive management to reduce maize planting risk and loss. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Port efficiency evaluations which take undesirable environmental outputs into consideration tend particularly important. Based on this observation, in this paper, we take pollution emissions as undesirable outputs and employ generalised directional distance function (GDDF) to evaluate the technical efficiency (TE) and comprehensive efficiency (CE) for the 21 coastal ports in China. Results show that: 1) for each of the ports, its CE value is higher than its TE value after considering undesirable output in efficiency evaluation during 2008-2012; 2) TE and CE values of the five port groups differ significantly, and 'strong north and weak south' phenomenon appears; 3) efficiency gaps among ports are obvious; 4) in order to achieve higher CE values, the southeast coastal port group, the southwest coastal port group and the pearl river delta port group need to reduce investment greatly.

The aggregation is constructed by the action of each individual, each action solely on basis of its local perception of the world. Scientists from different backgrounds have tried to model collective behaviour. Most of the models are strictly metric (based on Euclidian distance among individuals) but flocks of birds do not act on metric perception. In this paper we proposed a model based on topological perspective to construct a flock of birds with large number of individuals and checked flock’s density independent behaviour.	aggregate data;euclidean distance;flock;flocking (behavior);interaction;self-propelled particles;simulation	Masud Rana;DongSheng Cai	2012			computer science;computer vision;artificial intelligence	Vision	-15.537914414881143	-16.607729944153988	135697

Specifically, a new analytical methodology is developed to manage the typical risks of plant commissioning. Following a detailed study of the commissioning process and its criticalities, Hazop is selected as the most suitable approach in forecasting particular risks of this project stage. Starting from the limitations of both Hazop and Human Hazop (the extension of the technique to the field of procedures performed by humans), a new technique (Multilevel Hazop ) is suggested which identifies in advance all the criticalities of each commissioning activity and defines actions to reduce risk and optimise dedicated resources. After implementation of Multilevel Hazop in a real commissioning process, a new version of the technique (Two Stage Multilevel Hazop ) is proposed. This allows a significant reduction in implementation costs, justifying use of the technique both in innovative or critical cases, where the expected saving from risk reduction is high, and in general contexts. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

When overall scores of several suppliers are similar, it is hard to obtain an accurate ranking of these suppliers. Applying the Diversity Factors Method (Diversity Factors Method, DFM) may lead to over correction of weights, which would degrade the capability of indexes to reflect the importance. A Limited Diversity Factors Method (Limited Diversity Factors Method, LDFM) based on entropy is presented in this paper in order to adjust the weights, in order to relieve the over correction in DFM and to improve the capability of identification of indexes in supplier selection. An example of salvage ship bidding demonstrates the advantages of the LDFM, in which the raking of overall scores of suppliers is more accurate.	data recovery;design for manufacturability	Minghui Shao;Yan Song;Biao Wu;Yanjie Chang	2018	Algorithms	10.3390/a11050063	reliability engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;analytic hierarchy process;bidding;design for manufacturability;ranking	Web+IR	-5.935862650238483	-17.380245135747867	135889
74d95c81e24c93f34f4ac4183e1bfccbad36ba17	multicriteria decision support in designing transport systems		Paper presents selected aspects of multicriteria decision making in transport. One of the significant problems of modern transport systems is proper assessment of selection of transport system equipment to performed tasks. This assessment is difficult due to the complexity of issues. On the one hand it results from technical limitations, financial and ecological constraints, and public interest, but on the other hand various points of view of individual participants of transportation process trying to maximize their individual advantage must be taken into account. As a result the examination and evaluation of transport systems requires multi-criteria decision-making models. These models allow taking into account a number of contradictory points of view and lead to the identification of a “best compromise”. Assessment of transport organization alternatives was performed by Super Choose application. The application implements ranking method and MAJA method to support decision-making.	best practice;decision problem;decision support system;qualitative comparative analysis	Marianna Jacyna;Mariusz Wasiak	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-24577-5_2	decision support system;public interest;management science;business;ranking;compromise	SE	-5.43677965460835	-16.290838513278175	136027

The majority of current trust models consist of a central entity that verifies compliance with the trust requirements, using standardized evaluation methods and criteria. In decentralized environments, the communication scenarios are more complex, and no universally accepted objective requirements or evaluation criteria exist. It should be noted that the situation would get even more complicated when agents are interacting with each other. The goal of this research is to model trust and reputation in decentralized multi-agent systems. To achieve this, we have chosen the Ntropi model, among several other models, as a starting point, The efficiency of the model in such scenarios has been significantly improved by introducing a new probabilistic reputation algorithm for the Ntropi model.	algorithm;electronic funds transfer;interaction;multi-agent system;requirement;trusted computer system evaluation criteria;usability	Mozhgan Tavakolifard;Svein J.

c5015de62aea34173de1dddb2ea6d79a2fe5fa45	a reassessment of the global food security index by using a hierarchical data envelopment analysis approach		Abstract This study proposes a hierarchical data envelopment analysis (H-DEA) approach to construct a multi-dimensional indicator, and applies it to reassess the 2014 Global Food Security Index created by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) across 110 countries. Instead of using expert opinions to assign weights, the proposed model endogenises the weights, and thus avoids the problems of subjective weighting for international comparisons. The results show that although the ranking is not significantly different from that of the EIU, the optimal scores and weights differ by income levels. Additionally, this work articulates the value of a well-founded performance evaluation method by leveraging experts’ opinions and data-driven techniques through constructing a best-practice frontier with observation-specific weights. It is suggested that food availability should be the top policy priority in low- to medium-income and Sub-Saharan African countries where food deficits are most prevalent. The findings can serve as guidance to improve the design of the ongoing efforts for global food security.	data envelopment analysis;hierarchical database model	Po-Chi Chen;Ming-Miin Yu;Jou-Chen Shih;Ching-Cheng Chang;Shih-Hsun Hsu	2019	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2018.06.045	operations research;mathematical optimization;mathematics;food security;data envelopment analysis;ranking;international comparisons;weighting;hierarchical database model;envelopment;frontier	DB	-8.199716011084595	-18.209594420960297	136494

If the right safety measures are implemented beforehand, harmful effects can be significantly mitigated. However, evaluation and selection of effective measures is difficult due to the numerous scenarios that exist in most emergency environments coupled with the high associated cost of testing such scenarios. An agent-based system employs a computational model of autonomous interacting agents in an environment with the purpose of assessing the emergent behavior of the group. This paper presents a prototype of a computer simulation and decision support system that uses agent-based modeling to simulate crowd evacuation in the presence of a fire disaster and provides for testing of multiple disaster scenarios at virtually no cost. The prototype is unique in the current literature as it is specifically designed to simulate a concert venue setting such as a stadium or auditorium and is highly configurable allowing for user definition of concert venues with any arrangement of seats, pathways, stages, exits, and people as well as the definition of multiple fires with fire and smoke dynamics included.	agent-based model;agent-based social simulation;venue (sound system)	Neal Wagner;Vikas Agrawal	2014	Expert Syst.

Real participation only takes place when stakeholders are part of the decision-making process. This can occur directly when local communities come together to make floodplain management choices or if democratically elected or otherwise accountable agencies or groups can represent stakeholders. Real participation is more than consultation and requires that stakeholders at all levels of the social structure have an impact on decisions at different levels of floodplain management. A participatory approach is the only means for achieving long-lasting consensus and common agreement. However, for this to occur, stakeholders and officials from water management agencies have to recognize that the sustainability of floodplain management decisions is a common problem and that all parties are going to have to sacrifice some desires for the common good. There is common responsibility for making participation possible. This involves (a) the creation of mechanisms for stakeholder consultation at various scales (from local, over watershed to national) and (b) the creation of participatory capacity, particularly amongst marginalized social groups. This may include awareness raising, confidence building and education, as well as the provision of the economic resources needed to facilitate participation and the establishment of good and transparent sources of information. This work focuses on the methodology for stakeholder participation in floodplain management. Floodplain management problems are characterized by multiple objectives and large number of stakeholders. The solution methodologies adapted for multi-criteria multi participant decision problems are generally based on aggregation of decisions obtained for individual decision makers. This approach seems somewhat inadequate when the number of stakeholders is very large. We have developed a methodology to include the views of multiple stakeholders using fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic. Three possible different response types: scale (crisp), linguistic (fuzzy), and conditional (fuzzy) are analyzed to obtain the resultant input by using Fuzzy Expected Value. Fuzzy Expected Value input is used with the multi-criteria decision-making tool named Fuzzy Compromise Programming. The methodology has been applied to floodplain management in the Red River Basin, Canada that faces periodical flooding. We have demonstrated that the empowerment of stakeholders can improve the floodplain management process and provide decisions acceptable to a wider group of stakeholders. # 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This implies that one has to question the validity of management information produced through aggregation in numerou~ data processing systems. It also signifies that application of models based on definition and behavioural equations can be dangerous. Simulation-based inquiry systems are, however, capable of providing support even in these circumstances. With a simulation-based decision support system for global decision-making we may analyze through disaggregation the effects of these decisions at local levels. By using a problem-solving environment based on system description and simulation, effective decision support systems can be developed efficiently.	decision support system;management information system;problem solving environment;simulation	Henk G.

300e40f01c0a295fce481176da8a4a78cfb5bc88	predicting the effects of alternative pricing strategies in an artificial society undergoing technology adoption	market share;agent modeling;computer model;soft computing;decision maker;collective behavior;technology adoption;collective decision making	Artificial societies are computer models in which the collective behavior of a population of simulated human decision makers is observed over time. Here we describe an artificial society of “soft computing agents” (model consumers) making probabilistic purchasing decisions about new technological products that are introduced by competing firms. The model is studied under varying conditions to determine the relative success of these firms as they pursue different pricing strategies designed to increase their market share. We find that a critical factor in determining the success of different pricing strategies is the utility that an individual consumer gains from other consumers adopting the same technology. Further, financial success is uncoupled from market share under some conditions, so (for example) while an inferior technology may gain substantial market share by aggressive price-cutting, it is unlikely to gain financial rewards. These results add to growing evidence that artificial society models may prove useful in improving our understanding of collective decision making in complex sociological, economic and business management situations. 1 Technology Markets with Network Externalities Expanding the scientific understanding of collective human behavior and decision making in the context of uncertainty is of interest in many fields, including psychology, sociology, economics, and business management. Most research in this area has been based on experimental data collection and analysis from populations of human subjects. However, it is increasingly being recognized that agent-based models of human populations provide a potentially powerful framework for investigating the collective behavior of people, in part due to their explicit representation of space, and their focus on concurrent local computations that lead to self-organization and emergent behaviors. Such artificial societies typically consist of a two dimensional cellular space in which simple computer-simulated agents (individuals representing people) exist, make decisions, and possibly move around. Given that these models often focus on human decision making in the face of uncertainty, and the simplifications needed to produce computationally-tractable models of human social interactions, it is not 36 J.K. Frels, D. Heisler, and J.A. Reggia surprising that soft computing methods such as neural networks, evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence and probabilistic reasoning are playing an increasing role in these and related multi-agent systems (Loia 2003; Wagner et al, 2006; Lapizco-Encinas et al, 2005; Mazanec 2006; Libai, Muller and Peres 2005). In the context of the complexities of human cognition and decision making, it might be expected that artificial societies would be unlikely to produce unexpected or interesting results. However, it has repeatedly been found that, even with relatively simple rules governing agent behaviors, these models can produce collective behaviors reminiscent of those seen in human social situations. For example, in one of the earliest and best known artificial societies involving a cellular space, individuals/agents occupying a fraction of the cells in a two dimensional lattice would count how many of their neighbors shared with them a single cultural feature (in this case the feature was called “race”) (Schelling 1969). If this number was too low, the individual would move to an adjacent empty cell, causing initially randomly distributed individuals to form spatial clusters of agents having the same feature (“segregated neighborhoods”) over time. A related model subsequently showed that if individuals have multiple cultural features (political affiliation, dress style, etc.), and similar individuals influenced each other to become more similar, multiple homogeneous “cultural regions” would emerge over time (Axelrod 1997). Most closely related to the work here are similar agent-based models that examine difficult issues in economics and marketing. For example, the influential Sugarscape artificial society (Epstein and Axtell 1996) has demonstrated that fairly simple rules can produce a skewed distribution of wealth similar to that seen in human societies, while a more recent model has been used to explain temporal patterns in consumer electronics markets’ sales data (Goldenberg, Libai and Muller 2002). Cellular automata have been used to show that commonly accepted rules of market entry strategies may not be robust under differing levels of innovativeness and various response functions to advertising (Libai, Muller and Peres 2005). Other recent work has examined the effectiveness of market segmentation schemes using agents that have some degree of autonomy and limited learning capability (Mazanec 2006). Many other related models in economics and marketing are described in (Tesfatsion 2002). Other studies have used artificial societies to examine such issues as evolution of cooperative behavior (Hauert and Doebeli 2004), traffic flow (Gaylord and Nishidate 1996), urban growth patterns (Back 1996), and the emergence of communication (Reggia, Schulz, Wilkinson and Uriagereka 2001; Wagner, Reggia, Uriagereka, and Wilkinson 2003). In the following we describe our research using an artificial society that we call StandardScape to investigate human decision making during the adoption of new technology and the development of de facto “standards”. The core of StandardScape is a population of soft computing agents, each intended to be a simplified, probabilistic approximation to human decision making in the context of uncertainties about a product’s future success and the weighting that people give to different factors during product adoption decisions. As part of model development, we collected and analyzed data from over 140 people that provided us with weight estimates used by the model’s agents. Our goal in creating StandardScape was to determine whether such a model of technology adoption could be developed effectively, and if so, to use it to examine the relative success of technology firms adopting different pricing strategies to compete for market share.

It is more true for military systems which operate in a battle context. Indeed as they must act in a hostile environment, they can become unavailable due to failures of or damage to the system. In both cases, system regeneration is required to restore its availability. Many approaches based on system modelling have been developed to assess availability. However, very few of them take battlefield damage into account and relevant methods for the model development are missing. In this paper, a modelling method for architecture of weapon system of systems that supports regeneration engineering is proposed. On the one hand, this method relies on a unified failure/damage approach to extend acknowledged availability models. It allows to integrate failures, damages, as well as the possibility of regeneration, into operational availability assessment. Architectures are modelled as a set of operational functions, supported by components that belong to platform (system). Modelling atoms (i.e. elementary units of modelling) for both the architecture components and functions are defined, based on state-space formalism. Monte Carlo method is used to estimate availability through simulation. Availability of the architecture is defined on the basis of the possible states of the required functions for a mission. The states of a function directly depend on the state of the corresponding components (i.e. the components that support the function). Aggregation rules define the state of the function knowing the states of each component. Aggregation is defined by means of combinatorial equations of the component states. The modelling approach is supported by means of stochastic activity network for the models simulation. Results are analysed in terms of graphs of availability for mission’s days. Thus, given the simulation results, it is possible to plan combat missions based on criteria such as the number of platforms to be involved given functions required for the mission or the mean of regeneration to be deployed given the possible threats. Further, the simulation will help towards the design of improved architecture of system of systems which could focus on the factors affecting the availability. & 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

By casting the problem as a network game, we show existence of Nash equilibrium quantizer designs. For any agent, under Nash equilibrium, the word representing a given partition region is the conditional expectation of the mixture of local and social source probability distributions within the region. Further, the network may converge to equilibrium through a distributed version of the Lloyd-Max algorithm. In contrast to traditional results in the evolution of language, we find several vocabularies may coexist in the Nash equilibrium, with each individual having exactly one of these vocabularies. The overlap between vocabularies is high for individuals that communicate frequently and have similar local sources. Finally, we argue error in translation along a chain of communication does not grow if and only if the chain consists of agents with shared vocabulary.	codebook;coexist (image);converge;evolution;game theory;lloyd's algorithm;nash equilibrium;quantization (signal processing);vocabulary	Ankur Mani;Lav R.

The control parameters of the maps correspond to the internal states of individuals, such as emotions, goals, etc. The dynamical variables in the maps correspond to behavior. Computer simulations are used to investigate how the coordination of behavior changes as a function of the strength of coupling and the similarity of internal states. Several qualitatively different types of coordination have been observed, with synchronization in-phase occurring for strong coupling and similarity in internal states. In a variation of the basic model, each map can adjust its ow n control parameter to synchronize its dynamics with that of other maps.

Computers, Environment and U In recent years, criminologists have become interested in understanding crime variations at progressively finer spatial scales, right down to individual streets or even houses. To model at these fine spatial scales, and to better account for the dynamics of the crime system, agent-based models of crime are emerging. Generally, these have been more successful in representing the behaviour of criminals than their victims. In this paper it is suggested that individual representations of criminal behaviour can be enhanced by combining them with models of the criminal environment which are specified at a similar scale. In the case of burglary this means the identification of individual households as targets. We will show how this can be achieved using the complementary technique of microsimulation. The work is significant because it allows agent-based models of crime to be refined geographically (to allow, for example, individual households with varying wealth or occupancy measures) and leads to the identification of the characteristics of individual victims. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These areas are ordinary in the proximity of built-up areas and buffers areas of 1km were delimited for every locality. Based on various map layers in vector formats ( land use, rivers, buil-up areas, roads etc) an assessment method is performed to highlight the potential areas vulnerable to illegal dumping inside these buffer areas at local scale. The results are corelated to field observations and current situation of waste management systems. The maps outline local disparities due to various geographical conditions of county. This approach is a necesary tool in EIA studies particularly for rural waste management systems at local and regional scale which are less studied in current literature than urban areas.	delimiter;geographic information system;gradient;locality of reference;map;scart	Florin-Constantin Mihai;Adrian Ursu;Pavel Ichim;Dan-Adrian Chelaru	2015	CoRR	10.5593/SGEM2013/BE5.V1/S20.037	geomatics;environmental engineering;rural area	HCI	-11.752330733026017	-23.23675753254848	138084

Permits to discharge are determined by comparison of design predictions with standards. Standards are often statistical and, in consequence, the calculations are completed using Monte-Carlo techniques. In some cases, the application of Monte-Carlo is impeded by computational limitations, when only a small number of scenarios can be simulated. This can occur in complex systems, such as the marine environment, when computational fluid dynamic models are used. There is a need to relate the outcome of these simulations to the required standards in order to evaluate the design proposal. The Justified Design Evaluation (JUDE) method has been developed to meet this need. Essentially, the method identifies the set of input values required to invoke the environmental response for the percentile and standard under consideration. It has been tested successfully in a freshwater and a marine example. The method has general applicability in the sense that it is not restricted to a specific model type or environmental system. Uncertainty in applying the method is quantified.  2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, as customers and their needs grow increasingly diverse, meeting every consumer’s need has become a surefire way to add unnecessary cost and complexity to operations. Furthermore, consumers are not all really ready for mass customization. They have to face inconveniences such as expensive price, delay delivery and they have to spend time “designing” their product. In order to solve this problem, we proposed a way of intelligent agent assisted negotiation and recommendation. The recommendation is a preference elicitation process, while the negotiation is a communication process based on the situation of manufacturer, such as the inventory level, production cost and lead time. With the aid of intelligent agent of negotiation and recommendation, a good balance between efficiency and customer satisfactions of mass customization can be reached.	intelligent agent;preference elicitation	Jiaqi Yan;Yani Shi;Sherry X.

The mechanisms of automated negotiation, such as argumentation, can be used in Ubiquitous Group Decision Support Systems to help decision-makers find a solution based on their preferences. However, there are some other important issues that affect the decision-making process beyond typical preferences over criteria and alternatives. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that will allow agents to reason about self-expertise and other decision makers’ credibility. This way, we intend agents to achieve better quality and more consensual decisions. Our algorithm includes not only the decision-maker’s preferences but also his intentions in the process. By using the proposed model, agents achieved a stronger consensus in all scenarios that were considered and higher satisfaction levels in the most complex scenarios.

It utilizes the hesitant fuzzy linguistic information to describe the problem's uncertainty and fuzziness, portrays decision maker's satisfaction degree with the increasing marginal utility, and applies the hyperplane to establish a mathematical programming model. Then, the undetermined parameter in the model is discussed, and a decision-making procedure for solving the considered problem is provided. Furthermore, an experiment is designed to verify the availability and reasonability of the proposed method by comparing it with an existing one. Finally, the method is applied to assess the impact of giant hydropower stations’ flood discharge and energy dissipation on the environment in Sichuan, China.	discharger;marginal model;mathematical optimization;programming model	Peijia Ren;Bin Zhu;Zeshui Xu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2018.2798598	fuzzy logic;mathematics;artificial intelligence;hyperplane;machine learning;marginal utility;mathematical optimization;hydropower;dissipation;rule-based machine translation	SE	-6.452111574354263	-18.92427293075403	139187

It is critical to express uncertain information effectively and depose them in a reasonable and simple way. The purpose of this paper is to solve the grey target problem by the grey potential degree method without whiten value and without distribution function. Furthermore, this new approach has an advantage of realizing both comparing and standardization work during the process of treating the data.rnrnrnrnrnDesign/methodology/approachrnrnrnrnrnFirst, this paper makes a brief overview of the existing method for grey target decision. Then, the conception of a grey potential degree system is introduced and the conception of standard grey potential degree is build up, and a new grey potential-based method based on the grey target multiple attribute decision method is proposed. At the same time, the standard grey potential and its application in multiple resource data are studied.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnAt the same time the standard grey potential and its application in multiple resource data are studied. Standard grey potential is presented by means of three examples together with the comparison with the existing method to demonstrate that the grey potential-based method could be used to solve the problem of grey target decision conveniently and effectively.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnIt is very important to compare grey numbers to obtain scientific and reasonable results for a grey target decision-making problem. However, in the actual application of grey numbers, it is difficult to find out the probability density function or the whiten function of grey numbers. When grey numbers are compared and deposed through the whiten value, much information regarding grey numbers will be lost and, at the same time, the value of grey numbers in uncertainty is partly lost.

To overcome this obstacle, we often resort to macro modelling. However, building a macro model of a complex manufacturing system is nontrivial and carries with it a number of significant risks and difficulties. There are problems with the mechanics of performing the work and the validation of the final macro model. In this paper we document an approach that addresses both the mechanics and validation issues. The “zero internal banking” approach is presented and used to build a macro model which utilizes information provided by isolated micro models.	simulation	Drazen Kostelski;John A. Buzacott;Kenneth N.

Based on a data set describing the evolution of buyer-seller links among 55,608 firms over a decade and structural equation modeling, we find some evidence that interfirm networks evolve reflecting a firm's local decisions to mitigate adverse effects from neighbor firms through interfirm linkage, while enjoying positive effects from them. As a result, link renewal tends to have a positive impact on the growth rates of firms. We also investigate the role of networks in aggregate fluctuations.	aggregate data;aggregate function;linkage (software);shock;structural equation modeling	Ryohei Hisano;Tsutomu Watanabe;Takayuki Mizuno;Takaaki Ohnishi;Didier Sornette	2017		10.1007/s41109-017-0030-7	simulation;economics;operations management;management science	Web+IR	-12.434081776095208	-16.983489950461617	139881

While there are several quantitative methods to estimate acquisition program cost and schedule performance as well as identify their risks e.g., Earned Value Management, the estimation of technical performance and technical risk is generally heuristic in nature. In order to monitor the progress of the technical aspects of an acquisition program, the systems engineering discipline utilizes the process of tracking Technical Measures to gain insight into the design and development, to assess risks and issues, and to evaluate the likelihood of realizing objectives. However, with the diversity of so many technical programs, the estimation and risk analysis of technical performance in technology acquisition programs rely on the opinions of experts because the identification and application of relevant quantitative data for constructive modeling is not practical. The Expert-weighted Technical Risk Index methodology proposed in this article introduces a well-established method for mathematically combining expert judgment into the realm of systems engineering to develop predictive progress plans for technical performance estimation and risk analysis. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

45ca0dc377697311d5e25de378b026409a69a4ae	maritime environmental disaster management using intelligent techniques		The maritime environmental disasters are generally caused by collision, grounding, stranding heavy weather, explosion or fire. These disasters can cause spillage of oil, bunker, dirty water or chemical harmful substances. It is well known that the most known environmental disaster in maritime having serious impacts on marine life is oil spill. Although several intelligence techniques like heuristic search algorithms, machine learning, and fuzzy approach have been employed in maritime sector with various purposes, in the literature, applications of intelligent techniques for the solution of the maritime environmental disaster problems are quite limited. In this study, an intelligent system which consists of model-base, database, environmental disaster management actions, ship operation management actions, user interface, environmental disaster modelling, and decision support unit has been proposed. The proposed system, called as Maritime Intelligent Environmental Disaster Management (MIEDM), is aimed at strengthening operating mechanism along with the mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery phases to eliminate the potential impacts of maritime environmental disasters.

The fundamental idea behind this approach is that elements of a system (represented by network vertices) and their interactions (represented by edges) can be assembled to form structures. Structures are considered to be at one hierarchical level above the elements and interactions that form them, leading to a multi-level organisation. Analysing complex systems represented by multi-level networks make possible the study of the relationships between network topology and dynamics to the system’s global outcome.

1dd6ad6332e67e9f0ad1c8c2d17517afdd2d24b2	sa-iga: a multiagent reinforcement learning method towards socially optimal outcomes		In multiagent environments, the capability of learning is important for an agent to behave appropriately in face of unknown opponents and dynamic environment. From the system designer’s perspective, it is desirable if the agents can learn to coordinate towards socially optimal outcomes, while also avoiding being exploited by selfish opponents. To this end, we propose a novel gradient ascent based algorithm (SA-IGA) which augments the basic gradient-ascent algorithm by incorporating social awareness into the policy update process. We theoretically analyze the learning dynamics of SA-IGA using dynamical system theory and SA-IGA is shown to have linear dynamics for a wide range of games including symmetric games. The learning dynamics of two representative games (the prisoner’s dilemma game and the coordination game) are analyzed in details. Based on the idea of SA-IGA, we further propose a practical multiagent learning algorithm, called SA-PGA, based on Q-learning update rule. Simulation results show that SA-PGA agent can achieve higher social welfare than previous social-optimality oriented Conditional Joint Action Learner (CJAL) and also is robust against individually rational opponents by reaching Nash equilibrium solutions.

Cases are: survival abilities of a bacterial colony, and hunter and dog versus rabbit. This paper also presents the methodology of identification and translation of the mentioned cases of Collective Intelligence phenomena into simulation models. The results show a strong increase of the social structure ability when the Collective Intelligence is functioning. The problem of the Collective Intelligence is so complex, that the results presented here should be considered as a case study. In general, on the basis of presented results, the paper advertises and advocates the theory of Collective Intelligence based on molecular model of computations.	collective intelligence	Tadeusz Szuba;Pawel Polanski;Pawel Schab;Pawel Wielicki	2011	Trans.

Such systems, referred to as multicriteria recommenders, demonstrated early the potential of applying Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods to facilitate recommendation in numerous application domains. On the other hand, systematic implementation and testing of multicriteria recommender systems in the context of real-life applications still remains rather limited. Previous studies dealing with the evaluation of recommender systems have outlined the importance of carrying out careful testing and parameterization of a recommender system, before it is actually deployed in a real setting. In this paper, the experimental analysis of several design options for three proposed multiattribute utility collaborative filtering algorithms is presented for a particular application context (recommendation of e-markets to online customers), under conditions similar to the ones expected during actual operation. The results of this study indicate that the performance of recommendation algorithms depends on the characteristics of the application context, as these are reflected on the properties of evaluations’ data set. Therefore, it is judged important to experimentally analyze various design choices for multicriteria recommender systems, before their actual deployment.

540392b9b4090516f51139f55e7ca9a34e946b69	the bass diffusion model on finite barabasi-albert networks		Using a mean-field network formulation of the Bass innovation diffusion model and exact results by Fotouhi and Rabbat on the degree correlations of BarabasiAlbert networks, we compute the times of the diffusion peak and compare them with those on scale-free networks which have the same scale-free exponent but different assortativity properties. We compare our results with those obtained by Caldarelli et al. for the SIS epidemic model with the spectral method applied to adjacency matrices. It turns out that diffusion times on finite Barabasi-Albert networks are at a minimum. This may be due to a little-known property of these networks: although the value of the assortativity coefficient is close to zero, they look disassortative if one considers only a bounded range of degrees, including the smallest ones, and slightly assortative on the range of the higher degrees. We also find that if the trickle-down character of the diffusion process is enhanced by a larger initial stimulus on the hubs (via a inhomogeneous linear term in the Bass model), the relative difference between the diffusion times for BA networks and uncorrelated networks is even larger, reaching for instance the 34% in a typical case on a network with 104 nodes.	adjacency matrix;apollonian network;assortativity;beneath a steel sky;business architecture;matthews correlation coefficient;relative change and difference;spectral method;term (logic);the times	Maria Letizia Bertotti;Giovanni Modanese	2018	CoRR		adjacency matrix;control theory;statistical physics;mathematics;diffusion (business);bounded function;bass diffusion model;diffusion process;epidemic model;exponent;assortativity	ML	-13.521637900741698	-16.805854440146717	141644
1455479003c2f37a60d891fb6ddb1e8443f680e9	a fuzzy collaborative assessment methodology for partner trust evaluation		Trust level assessment within collaborative networks is an interesting issue in the partner evaluation and partner selection literature. This paper proposes a fuzzy collaborative assessment methodology for partner trust evaluation within horizontal collaborative networks. The proposed approach concerns a group evaluation context where a decision-making comity associated with a manufacturer needs to evaluate its company's partners for their ranking purposes. Different expertise levels are attributed to the comity members. In this paper, trust level is evaluated based on information-sharing attributes considered in the literature as critical influencing factors. Different weights are associated with these attributes with respect to their corresponding influence on trust. The semantic fuzzy partitioning method is considered for the collaborative trust assessment based on unbalanced linguistic term sets representing information-sharing attributes. The developed approach is applied to a real case showing its effectiveness and its objectivity.		Omar Ayadi;Nesrin Halouani;Faouzi Masmoudi	2016	Int. J. Intell.

While the weighting process for the criteria is affected by the cooperation pattern that the company intends to pursue, the cooperation patterns are also affected by the emphasis on some specific criteria. The analytic network process that draws support from the concept of the Markov process is used to manipulate the interdependence situation. The decision-maker becomes aware of the choice of cooperation patterns with the suppliers by analyzing the weighting process for the criteria in the supplier selection process. It is different from the general way of determining the cooperation pattern subjectively. This also gives the decision-maker a chance to examine his previous decision. A numerical example has been used to verify the effectiveness of the approach. Although, in our example, only a single evaluator is involved in the evaluation process, the proposed approach is still applicable to the situation of multi-evaluators provided that data have been preprocessed appropriately.

Hence, their constituent agents must evaluate possible actions and opportunities based on local, subjective knowledge. When agents have insufficient personal experience, they may inevitably rely on their social connections to act as a source of relevant information or recommendations. We describe an agent-mediated electronic market for investigating social interaction within the context of evolving heterogeneous distributed networks. In our scenario, consumers look for appropriate services and this service choice is informed via peer recommendations. We define two alternative algorithms for selecting peers based on perceived similarity and we evaluate them on their ability to organise an overlay network such that it acts as a passive filter, tailoring the information that agents use to select services in the market. We use this scenario to explore the link between the peer selection algorithms and the emergent network topologies, as well as the impact of the peer selection algorithm on the agents’ performance in choosing services based on peer recommendations. Our simulation results demonstrate a qualitative difference in the behaviour of the algorithms, with optimal algorithm selection relying on information regarding the preferences of the wider population of agents. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, through modeling and analyzing Prisoner's Dilemma (PD)-like game based and Public-goods game based incentive mechanisms, we show that although it is impossible for incentive mechanisms to get the whole network into static """"absolute full cooperation (or reciprocation)"""" state, they can still drive the whole system into """"almost reciprocation"""" state, that is, most of the system time would be occupied by the cooperation (or reciprocation) state."""	autonomous robot;cognition;evolutionary governance theory;evolutionary algorithm;game theory;prisoner's dilemma;system time;unified framework	Yufeng Wang;Akihiro Nakao;Athanasios V.

284e74a17d7837cf12ce6a247ee3c3cc2883771e	collaborative learning of stochastic bandits over a social network		We consider a collaborative online learning paradigm, wherein a group of agents connected through a social network are engaged in playing a stochastic multi-armed bandit game. Each time an agent takes an action, the corresponding reward is instantaneously observed by the agent, as well as its neighbours in the social network. We perform a regret analysis of various policies in this collaborative learning setting. A key finding of this paper is that natural extensions of widely-studied single agent learning policies to the network setting need not perform well in terms of regret. In particular, we identify a class of non-altruistic and individually consistent policies, and argue by deriving regret lower bounds that they are liable to suffer a large regret in the networked setting. We also show that the learning performance can be substantially improved if the agents exploit the structure of the network, and develop a simple learning algorithm based on dominating sets of the network. Specifically, we first consider a star network, which is a common motif in hierarchical social networks, and show analytically that the hub agent can be used as an information sink to expedite learning and improve the overall regret.

Its purpose is to informmodel development and application and thus to increase chances for societal benefit of the modelling work. The key question is: How, when, and for what reasons does land use modelling contribute to societal problem solving? Addressing this question, we rely on a synthesis of three studies, reportedmore extensively elsewhere. Our research experience, as demonstrated by the three studies used as examples, implies that the impacts of using land usemodels are diverse. These impacts are not limited to learning about a land system, but extend to learning about the views, norms and values of other actors. Also, land use modelling work may enhance mediation of conflicts between stakeholders and contribute to community-building. The synthesis suggests that we need to anticipate the relatively fluid and fuzzy features of social contexts and problem solving processes to harness land use modelling for societal problem solving. To capture these features, wedeveloped a conceptual framework that linksfive important factors for understanding the contribution of modelling to societal change. Four contextual factors are distinguished and a set of processes that are important for these four factors to become fruitfully matched. The four contextual factors are: problem solving dynamics; model types; boundary arrangements; roles of models. The matching consists of contextualization and network building. In view of these findings we conclude that in designing a modelling strategy equal attention should be paid to the requirements for model development and the embedding of the work in a given/intended societal context. For those who pursue the use of science-based land use models, a number of activities seem particularly relevant: 1. Exploration of the possible and desired impacts of the land usemodel; 2. Network building of modellers, potential users and stakeholders; 3. Model contextualization, i.e. the explication of values and aspirations underlying the modelling work, fitting the model to a social and biophysical context and interpretation of modelling results in relation to other knowledge sources such as expert knowledge; 4. Fostering feelings of interdependency between the participants in the problem solving process. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

FAME is a micro-simulation model for freight transportation in the U. S. Despite many previous freight transportation models the model simulates commodity movements at the disaggregate level of firm-to-firm, but it also makes certain simplifying assumptions concerning logistics choices such as the use of intermediate handling facilities. This paper deals with issues related to incorporating the new logistics elements in the FAME framework and proposing a new conceptual framework named FAME II.	logistics;simulation	Zahra Pourabdollahi;Abolfazl Mohammadian;Kazuya Kawamura	2012		10.1145/2346536.2346574	simulation;engineering;operations management;traffic management;transport engineering	ML	-16.745348925816682	-20.42335454481058	142881

We present here, an application of the agent-based model in the case of an economy consisting of five primary users and secondary users (SUs) uniformly distributed in the linear region. We show that the price-based demand evolution and price competition play a significant role only in an “economizable” network loading band, while in both the low-loading and the over-loading state, the market rules fail. On the contrary, in the economizable loading state, the price competition, demand sensitivity and specific SUs’ locations work well, underpinning the known economic rules.	agent-based model;cognitive radio;network theory;organizing (structure);real-time clock;real-time transcription;relevance;self-management (computer science);self-organization	Ján Pastircák;Lukás Friga;Viliam Kováč;Juraj Gazda;Vladimír Gazda	2015	Journal of Network and Systems Management	10.1007/s10922-015-9355-7	cognitive radio;underpinning;economy;free market;secondary market;computer science	ECom	-7.463893207574209	-9.946125431560887	142897
62679e75d63d3f331c9c268bb4a1f3edadcfba51	quantification and integration of an improved kano model into qfd based on multi-population adaptive genetic algorithm		Abstract In an effort to address the inherent deficiencies of traditional Kano model and quality function deployment (QFD), this paper proposes an improved Kano model named as importance-frequency Kano (IF-Kano) model and integrates IF-Kano model into QFD. Considering the interaction between frequencies and importance weights of customer requirements (CRs), the IF-Kano model adopts the logical Kano classification criteria to categorize CRs. Then, both qualitative and quantitative results derived from IF-Kano model are integrated into QFD with a non-linear programming model. The model aims to determine appropriate Kano categories of CRs and target values of engineering characteristics (ECs) with a view to achieving an optimal design solution under the best balance between enterprise satisfaction and customer satisfaction (CS). To solve the presented model, a multi-population adaptive genetic algorithm (MPAGA) is designed. Finally, an example of a home elevator design is given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed approach and algorithm.	genetic algorithm;quality function deployment	Lina He;Wenyan Song;Zhenyong Wu;Zhitao Xu;Maokuan Zheng;Xin Guo Ming	2017	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2017.10.009	genetic algorithm;engineering;industrial engineering;mathematical optimization;optimal design;customer satisfaction;elevator;programming paradigm;kano model;quality function deployment;population;systems engineering	AI	-4.72864223488178	-16.394720167614555	142915

Two VDA-based methods for such problem solving — NORClass and STEPCLASS — are outlined. The STEPCLASS method is initially designed for the problem with nonordered values of attributes. The main idea of NORClass is based on the assumption that a domain expert is able to order the values of any attribute according to their typicality for each class differently and independently of the values of other attributes. We propose to integrate into the STEPCLASS method the main ideas from NORClass. It is shown that such integration allows increasing the efficiency of the STEPCLASS method in cases, where the above assumption is true, and to overcome some drawbacks of NORClass.		Eugenia M.

Air quality modellers usually need very detailed information about emissions in the area studied. Also when a box model is applied, not considering spatial features of the emissions, other details have to be inferred from the inventory in order to correctly feed the model: the hourly time profile is usually required for all pollutants, whereas details on particulate matter size spectrum and chemical composition are necessary when dealing with PM modelling and suitable speciation profiles of emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a stringent requirement for modelling complex photochemical processes in the atmosphere. THOSCANE handles the emission inventory and all these profiles to obtain detailed emission patterns suitable for complex atmospheric box models. 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, forecasts of environmental and health risks, associated with the drilling wastes, can provide the vital information needed for the sustainable resource development decisions. The aim of this paper is to foster an integrated interdisciplinary understanding of technical and operational risks associated with drilling wastes and their management by implementing the performance-based risk regime. The paper critically examines the role of performance-based risk assessment in drilling waste management by scrutinizing the methods used, as well as the underlying theories and assumptions. Furthermore, the paper studies the risk factors involved throughout the logistical chain of handling of drilling wastes in the Arctic region.	data drilling;logistics;risk assessment;risk management;theory	Yonas Zewdu Ayele;Abbas Barabadi;Javad Barabady	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM)	10.1109/IEEM.2015.7385922	arctic;environmental engineering;economics;risk management;hazard;engineering;civil engineering;waste management	SE	-12.638134714154019	-20.97695265939884	143466

The interactions take place between randomly chosen pairs. During an interaction, the agents propagate their opinions about themselves and about other people they know. Moreover, each individual is subject to vanity: if her interlocutor seems to value her highly, then she increases her opinion about this interlocutor. On the contrary she tends to decrease her opinion about those who seem to undervalue her. The combination of these dynamics with the hypothesis that the opinion propagation is more efficient when coming from highly valued individuals, leads to different patterns when varying the parameters. For instance, for some parameters the positive opinion links between individuals generate a small world network. In one of the patterns, absolute dominance of one agent alternates with a state of generalised distrust, where all agents have a very low opinion of all the others (including themselves). We provide some explanations of the mechanisms behind these emergent behaviors and finally propose a discussion about their interest.	distrust;emergence;interaction;randomness;software propagation	Guillaume Deffuant;Timoteo Carletti;Sylvie Huet	2013	J.

The decision-making on how to bid can be modeled as a fuzzy inference procedure using fuzzy rules that map environmental information to actions. The tuning of fuzzy database is based on a reinforcement learning method called symbiotic evolution learning method where fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules are learned based on reward/punishment signals. Such a learning ability enables our agents to adapt to different situations without being taught beforehand.

2fc0235eacbebf2dfcbfd10457fdee489aaf8272	efficiency analysis in two-stage structures using fuzzy data envelopment analysis		Two-stage data envelopment analysis (TsDEA) models evaluate the performance of a set of production systems in which each system includes two operational stages. Taking into account the internal structures is commonly found in many situations such as seller-buyer supply chain, health care provision and environmental management. Contrary to conventional DEA models as a black-box structure, TsDEA provides further insight into sources of inefficiencies and a more informative basis for performance evaluation. In addition, ignoring the qualitative and imprecise data leads to distorted evaluations, both for the subunits and the system efficiency. We present the fuzzy input and output-oriented TsDEA models to calculate the global and pure technical efficiencies of a system and sub-processes when some data are fuzzy. To this end, we propose a possibilistic programming problem and then convert it into a deterministic interval programming problem using the α-level based method. The proposed method preserves the link between two stages in the sense that the total efficiency of the system is equal to the product of the efficiencies derived from two stages. In addition to the study of technical efficiency, this research includes two further contributions to the ancillary literature; firstly, we minutely discuss the efficiency decompositions to indicate the sources of inefficiency and secondly, we present a method for ranking the efficient units in a fuzzy environment. An empirical illustration is also utilised to show the applicability of the proposed technique.	data envelopment analysis	Adel Hatami-Marbini;Saber Saati;Seyed Mojtaba Sajadi	2018	CEJOR	10.1007/s10100-018-0545-8	economics;fuzzy logic;mathematical optimization;supply chain;data envelopment analysis;inefficiency;ranking	NLP	-4.867286068730775	-16.75389096711886	144209

Model replication remains rare, yet is vital to assessing the repeatability of existing agent based models. Notably, more work is needed to assess cross platform and language replication, which represent potential sources of variability between model results. An existing, complex agent based model was replicated using two widely used platforms (NetLogo and Repast). When results generated by the models were compared, the findings differed not only in magnitude but the trends produced by the data, resulting in different conclusions being drawn from each set of model predictions. The variation between the models is believed to be a result of the complexity of encoding a substantial theoretical model in particular programming languages. This highlights the express need to document replication of existing models in order to fully understand the potential limitations to replication. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In that paper existence and stability of equilibria have been analyzed given a fixed structure of the collaboration network, divided into sub-networks. In this paper we analyze the influences of the degree of collaboration and spillovers on profits, social welfare and, more generally, on overall efficiency. We first consider two relevant benchmark cases, for which analytical results are provided, and then numerical experiments are performed to stress the role of the level of connectivity (i.e. the collaboration attitude) inside networks as well as the effects of involuntary knowledge spillovers inside each network and among different competing networks. © 2012 IMACS.

Stormwater speaks to a significant option for urban water source so as to minimize the load on crisp water assets, and to alleviate the environmental effect of urban stormwater runoff. Suitable site selection for urban stormwater harvesting is for the most part taking into account the acumen of water planners, who are confronted with the challenge of considering various socio-economic and technical components that impact the site aptness. To meet this challenge, the present work focused on developing an effective GIS based screening approach so as to identify the potentially appropriate stormwater harvesting sites in urban regions as a first attempt for then more comprehensive investigation. Initially, the concentration is on the suitability evaluation in view of the relationship between harvestable runoff and demand with the help of concept of accumulated catchments. The potential sites for stormwater harvesting were taken as drainage outlets of these accumulated catchments. With various screening parameters, the study is done for Dehradun city as with the increase in population thus causes imminent water crises in the city. In the study 28 potential stormwater harvesting sites are proposed out of which it can be further tune to 3 or 4 preferable sites. The quick identification of suitable stormwater harvesting sites can aid the planners in prioritizing schemes in regions that will have an enormous effect in the reduction of potable water demand.	geographic information system;information harvesting;mathematical optimization;program optimization;typset and runoff;urban computing	Shray Pathak;Anoop Kumar Shukla;Chandra Shekhar Prasad Ojha;R.

Understanding this adaptation is important for influencing and improving the decisions made. Recently, stimulus-response (S-R) learning models have been proposed as explanations for decision makers’ adaptation. S-R models hypothesize that decision makers choose an action option based on their anticipation of its success. Decision makers learn by accumulating evidence over action options and combining that evidence with prior expectations. This study examines a standard S-R model and a simple variation of this model, in which past experience may receive an extremely low weight, as explanations for decision makers’ adaptation in an evolving Internet-based bargaining environment. In Experiment 1, decision makers are taught to predict behavior in a bargaining task that follows rules that may be the opposite of, congruent to, or unrelated to a second task in which they must choose the deal terms they will offer. Both models provide a good account of the prediction task. However, only the second model, in which decision makers heavily discount all but the most recent past experience, provides a good account of subsequent behavior in the second task. To test whether Experiment 1 artificially related choice behavior and prediction, a second experiment examines both models’ predictions concerning the effects of bargaining experience on subsequent prediction. In this study, decision models where long-term experience plays a dominating role do not appear to provide adequate explanations of decision makers’ adaptation to their opponent’s changing response behavior.	control theory;experiment;real-time locating system	Faison P.

4008fd9fd87dabb6f4781f9312fb4df42cf5a9e1	strengthening quantitative risk assessments by systematic treatment of uncertain assumptions	uncertain assumptions;quantitative risk assessment;strength of knowledge;assumption deviation risk	The results of quantitative risk assessments (QRA) are conditional on the background knowledge on which the assessments are based, including phenomenological understanding, models, data and expert statements used, as well as assumptions made. Risk indices established in the risk assessment, such as individual risk numbers and f–N curves, may have a more or less solid foundation, depending for example on the validity of assumptions made. Poor models, lack of data or simplistic assumptions are examples of potential sources of uncertainty “hidden in the background knowledge” of a risk assessment. These uncertainties need to be reflected in the risk assessment. Recently, a method for treating uncertain assumptions in a QRA was suggested. The method is based on the different settings faced when making assumptions in risk assessments, considering beliefs about assumption deviation, sensitivity of the risk index to changes in the assumption, and the overall strength of knowledge involved. In the present paper we apply, test and adjust the method using a risk assessment of a lifting operation related to the oil and gas industry as a case. We find that an adjusted version of the method provides systematic guidance on how to treat uncertainties in a QRA.	risk assessment	Christine Louise Berner;Roger Flage	2016	Rel. Eng. & Sys.

This article investigates how such conventions can arise for color categories in populations of simulated “agents”. The method uses concepts from evolutionary game theory: A language game where agents assign names to color patches and is played repeatedly by members of a population. The evolutionary dynamics employed make minimal assumptions about agents’ perceptions and learning processes. Through various simulations it is shown that under different kinds of reasonable conditions involving outcomes of individual games, the evolutionary dynamics push populations to stationary equilibria, which can be interpreted as achieving shared population meaning systems. Optimal population agreement for meaning is characterized through a mathematical formula, and the simulations presented reveal that for a wide variety of situations, optimality is achieved.	categorization;color;evolutionary algorithm;game theory;population;simulation;stationary process	Louis Narens;Kimberly A.

72b1cf7c28465bd2c97955871b24b67db5ae983c	application of scientific computing and statistical analysis to address coastal hazards. (application du calcul scientifique et de l'analyse statistique à la gestion du risque littoral)		Studies and management of coastal hazards are of high concerns in our society, since they engage highly valuable economical and ecological stakes. Coastal hazards are generally responding to extreme environmental conditions. The study of these physical phenomena relies on the understanding of such environmental conditions, which are rarely (or even never) observed. In coastal areas, waves are the main source of energy. This energy is responsible of coastal hazards developed at different time-scales, like the submersion or the erosion. This work, taking place at the interface between Statistical Analysis, Geophysics and Computer Sciences, aiming at bringing forward tools and methods serving decision makers in charge of the management of such risks. In practice, the proposed solutions answer to the questionings with a consideration of the spatial dimension rather than only punctual aspects. This approach is more natural considering that environmental phenomena are generally spatial, as the sea-waves fields. The study of extreme realisations of such processes is based on the availability of a representative data set, both in time and space dimensions, allowing to extrapolating information beyond the actual observations. In particular for sea-waves fields, we use numerical simulation on high performance computational clusters (HPC) to product such a data set. The outcome of this work offers many application possibilities. Most notably, we propose from this data set two statistical methodologies, having respective goals of dealing with littoral hazards long-terms questionings (e.g., erosion) and event-scale questionings (e.g., submersion). The first one is based on the application of stochastic models so-called max-stable models, particularly adapted to the study of extreme values in a spatial context. Indeed, additionally to the marginal information, max-stable models allow to take into account the spatial dependence structures of the observed extreme processes. Our results show the interest of this method against the ones neglecting the spatial dependence of these phenomena for risk indices computation. The second approach is a semi-parametric method aiming at simulating extreme waves space-time processes. Those processes, interpreted as storms, are controlled and bi-variate uplifting of already observed extreme episodes. In other words, we create most severe storms than the ones already observed. These processes simulated at a controlled intensity may feed littoral physical models in		Romain Chailan	2015				HPC	-15.58590989678448	-20.77097466826599	145512
5a67efa430dc41bd94cbada72c37b5a05b821b02	towards a model of the human society: a theoretical solution of the cooperation problem		In this paper we address the cooperation problem in structured populations by considering the prisoner’s dilemma game as metaphor of the social interactions between individuals with imitation capacity. We present a new strategy update rule called democratic weighted update where the individuals behavior is socially influenced by each one of their neighbors. In particular, the capacity of an individual to socially influence other ones is proportional to its wisdom which is defined by its successful in the game. When in a neighborhood there are cooperators and defectors, the focal player is contradictorily influenced by them and, therefore, the effective social influence is given by the difference of the total wisdom of each strategy in its neighborhood. First, by considering the growing process of the network and neglecting mutations we show the evolution of highly cooperative systems. Then, we broadly shown that the social influence allows to overcome the emergence of mutants into highly cooperative systems. In this way, we are able to conclude that considering the growing process of the system, individuals with imitation capacity and the social influence the cooperation evolves. Therefore, here we present a theoretical solution of the cooperation problem among unrelated individuals with imitiation capacity.	consensus dynamics;emergence;focal (programming language);interaction;population;prisoner's dilemma;windows update	Ignacio Gomez Portillo	2013	CoRR		artificial intelligence	ML	-15.166181656304614	-14.396745220856054	145595

The engineering of a product incorporates numerous stages involving conceptual through detailed design. For small quantities or lot sizes (1-25 parts), the product design and process planning steps account for an inordinate share of the overall development cycle. An integrated geometric, performance analysis, and materials process ing eva luat ion env i ronment for concurrent , multidisciplinary design is needed to not only address design-through-production efficiencies and costs but enable more responsive product development cycles. The environment should enable the user to interactively evaluate alternative designs, not only of individual components or subsystems but combinatorial alternatives varying materials, performance envelopes and sizing. All of these issues are particularly relevant to a new class of aircraft, an uninhabited air vehicle (UAV), which is both unique in terms of its mission as well as vehicle life, environmental constraints, and component through system reliability and maintainability.	env;interactivity;iteration;new product development;profiling (computer programming);unmanned aerial vehicle	Max Blair;Steven R.

Threats in the context of swarm robotics can be executed through goal, behaviour, environment or communication manipulation. Experimental studies in this area are still sparse. We study an attack scenario performed by actively modifying the data between authorised participants. We formulate a robust probabilistic adaptive defence mechanism which does not aim at identifying malicious agents, but to provide the swarm with the means to minimise the consequences of the attack. The mechanism relies on a dynamic modification of the probability of agents to change their current information in view of new contradictory or corroborating incoming data. We investigate several experimental conditions in simulation. The results show that the presence of adversaries in the swarm hinders reaching consensus to the majority opinion when using a baseline method, but that there are several conditions in which our adaptive defence mechanism is highly efficient.	swarm	Giuseppe Primiero;Elio Tuci;Jacopo Tagliabue;Eliseo Ferrante	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-00533-7_17	swarm behaviour;machine learning;probabilistic logic;artificial intelligence;swarm robotics;computer science	Crypto	-15.752777830460687	-10.627159994252994	145908

The Simulator for Human Error Probability Analysis (SHERPA) model provides a theoretical framework that exploits the advantages of the simulation tools and the traditional HRA methods in order to model human behaviour and to predict the error probability for a given scenario in every kind of industrial system. Human reliability is estimated as function of the performed task, the Performance Shaping Factors (PSF) and the time worked, with the purpose of considering how reliability depends not only on the task and working context, but also on the time that the operator has already spent on the work. The model is able to estimate human reliability; to assess the effects due to different human reliability levels through evaluation of tasks performed more or less correctly; and to assess the impact of context via PSFs. SHERPA also provides the possibility of determining the optimal configuration of breaks. Through a methodology that uses assessments of an economic nature, it allows identification of the conditions required for the suspension of work in the shift for the operator’s psychophysical recovery and then for the restoration of acceptable values of reliability.	circuit restoration;heidelberg research architecture;human error;human factors and ergonomics;human reliability;noise shaping;scheduling (computing);simulation;traffic shaping	Valentina Di Pasquale;Salvatore Miranda;Raffaele Iannone;Stefano Riemma	2015	Rel.

From a concept analysis point of view, it has been shown that the context model can be semantically considered as a data model for fuzzy concept analysis (Huynh et al., 2004). From a decision analysis point of view, in order to deal with the problem of synthesis of vague evidence linguistically provided by experts in some situations of decision analysis, the notions of context–dependent vague characteristics and fuzzy context model will be introduced. It is shown that each context–dependent vague characteristic within fuzzy context model directly induces a uncertainty measure of type 2 interpreted as 'vague' belief function, which is inferred from vague evidence expressed linguistically.	vagueness	Van-Nam Huynh;Sadaaki Miyamoto;Yoshiteru Nakamori	2012	IJRIS	10.1504/IJRIS.2012.050375	dempster–shafer theory;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;statistics	NLP	-4.910710722372065	-23.885144728092442	146153
083e6ba5cfc69c4d8eaa83778527cc3ee3178e18	a hybrid weighting methodology for performance assessment in turkish municipalities		Performance assessment systems play an important role for controlling and improving a system. In case a robust performance assessment system is established, it will be easier and more trustable to make decisions. Although performance assessment systems have been applied in private sector for a long time, it can be regarded as new for the municipalities in Turkey. As a result of the legal compulsories, every municipality satisfying the conditions has to prepare a strategic plan and a performance program related with it. Performance assessment is carried out by considering the performance program of the municipalities. With this study, after the observations of performance assessment studies in some of the municipalities, a hybrid weighting methodology depending on ranking and fuzzy pairwise comparison is proposed. After giving the related literature about the performance assessment systems in municipalities, existing and proposed methodologies are explained and differences are indicated. For showing the applicability of the proposed model, a numerical example inspired by the real applications is developed and the proposed methodology is executed.

7571c003cc78b19227659ab6e9ca3c690f1f53d9	a hybrid mcdm technique for risk management in construction projects		Multi-stakeholder based construction projects are subject to various risk factors due to 17 dynamic business environments. These risks affect project activities which indirectly impact 18 construction costs, resulting in delays and poor building quality. So, managing these project risks 19 requires suitable risk mitigation strategies to evaluate and analyse their severity. Hence, risk 20 evaluation and assessment of construction projects is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) 21 problem. In present real-life problems, evaluation of project risks is often uncertain and even 22 incomplete, and the prevailing methodologies fail to handle such situations. To address the 23 problem, this paper extends the analytical network process (ANP) methodology in the D number 24 domain to handle three types of ambiguous evaluations, viz. complete, uncertain, and incomplete, 25 and assesses the weight of risk criteria. The D number based approach overcomes the deficiencies 26 of the exclusiveness hypothesis and completeness constraint of Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory. Here, 27 preference ratings of the decision matrix for each decision-maker are determined using a D number 28 extended consistent fuzzy preference relation (D-CFPR). An extended multi-attributive border 29 approximation area comparison (MABAC) method in D number is then developed to rank and 30 select the best alternative risk response strategy. Finally, an illustrative example from construction 31 sector is presented to check the feasibility of the proposed approach. For checking the reliability of 32 alternative ranking, a comparative analysis is performed with different MCDM approaches (D33 COPRAS, D-ARAS, D-MABAC, and D-TOPSIS). Based on different criteria weights, a sensitivity 34 analysis of obtained ranking of the hybrid D-ANP-MABAC model is performed for verify the 35 robustness of the proposed method. 36	approximation;common criteria;qualitative comparative analysis;real life;risk factor (computing);risk management;viz: the computer game	Kajal Chatterjee;Edmundas Kazimieras Zavadskas;Jolanta Tamosaitiene;Krishnendu Adhikary;Samarjit Kar	2018	Symmetry	10.3390/sym10020046	pareto efficiency;robustness (computer science);risk management;fuzzy logic;decision matrix;multiple-criteria decision analysis;project management;mathematics;ranking;reliability engineering	SE	-5.919009512494493	-18.13408871875924	146312

Nowadays cities tend to become """"Smarter"""", usually disregarding the issues of energy efficiency and sustainability. Therefore, optimizing energy use in a city remains a challenge and respective decision support systems are important to guide local authorities toward that direction. This paper provides a holistic approach presenting a Smart City Energy Assessment Framework (SCEAF) along with a specific web based decision support tool, the so-called e-SCEAF, which can provide local authorities with fruitful results for assessing the energy behavior and performance of their city. The tool merges heterogeneous information, such as clearly quantifiable energy related indicators, the related city policy context performance and the integration of smart infrastructure. This multi-source information fusion is based on the 2-tuple linguistic representation model of Herrera and Martinez. This particular model has been widely used in decision problems and was mainly selected due to the fact that it provides linguistic results that are accurate and easy to understand by the cities' local authorities. The performance, usefulness and effectiveness of the SCEAF framework and the e-SCEAF tool are tested on a real life application in three different cities, Savona (Italy), Sant Cugat del Valles (Spain) and Zaanstad (The Netherlands).

To further reduce the innovation risk, SCC must seek the feasible innovation strategies to match ecological niche-matching degree; within a competing cluster, it should avoid the hazardous nature of pure competition that affects the innovation output, and within a cooperation innovation cluster it should look carefully for the cooperation innovation mechanism. This paper examines the impact of growth of SCC from a perspective of ecological niche, the innovation strategy and the expansion of ecological niche, and its matching degree on the influence of the growth in SCC; and presents the ecological niche expansion model, growth model and growth evolution model of SCC. The findings of this research suggest that there is a five-stage evolution of which the characteristic is different in different innovation strategies. The ecological niche width of SCC is connected by each member’s ecological niche, and the expansion process is constituted by the members’ ecological niche expansion. In each stage, SCC should identify ecological niche-matching degree between members and innovation modes when the SCC expands the niche width to a certain limit. Finally, a case study demonstrates the application potential of the model and its implications.

1af06447520a192b9fa436c4b5265a6e2cd604ee	an extension of aras methodology under interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment for digital supply chain		Abstract Technology, such as personal computers and mobile devices, alters the foundation of how people communicate and interact with their surrounding environment. Emerging technologies affect every industry and management of supply chain and logistics are no exception. Given that Digital Supply Chain (DSC) provides several opportunities to companies the topic has received increasing attention from both academia and industry in the recent years. Today, an emerging worldwide trend in supply chain management is a shift of the focus from classical supply chains towards DSC, which leverages new solutions to generate new sources of revenue and additional business value for organizations. Recognizing these potential benefits, today’s modern organizations now interact with their dealers through DSC processes for improved efficiency and effectiveness in their production and delivery operations. Supplier selection is one of the crucial processes that has been affected by the digitalization of supply chain management. Addressing multi-criteria nature of the supplier selection process, this article introduces a new DSC approach for the first time to support the supplier selection process. This approach develops a group decision making (GDM) method in an uncertain environment. This methodology also considers decision makers when they are under pressure and/or lack expertise during the evaluation process. The proposed framework integrates for the first time the Interval Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy (IVIF) Sets, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) under a GDM environment. IVIF AHP is used to evaluate criteria weights and IVIF ARAS methodology is used for the alternative assessment procedure. The paper also included the analyses for the selection of a suitable supplier in a real case study from Turkey to illustrate the validity of the proposed novel approach.	fuzzy set	Gülçin Büyüközkan;Fethullah Göçer	2018	Appl.

This paper reviews the major economic modeling approaches for forecasting recreation activity, and for measuring the benefits from it. These approaches are major considerations in decisions on the planning, provision, and management of recreation areas and facilities.	automated planning and scheduling	Charles J. Cicchetti;Anthony C.

60d607c15184ee9e4f0b3215963fdaadd9e6ab24	integrating computational and participatory simulations for design in complex systems	datorsystem;computer systems;technology and health;teknik och halsa	The understanding and conceptualization of cities and its constituent systems such as transportation and healthcare as open and complex is shifting the debates around the technical and communicative rationales of planning. Viewing cities in a holistic manner, as being organized at multiple scales and by multiple actors presents methodological challenges, one where our understanding of dynamism is applied in a tangible fashion to planning processes. Bridging the two rationales in the tools and methodologies of planning is necessary for the emergence of a “non-linear rationality” of planning, a theory that can account for complexity and one that is premised upon the complexity sciences. Simulations representing complex systems serves to provide evidence and support for planning, and has the potential to serve as an interface between the more abstract and political decision making and the material city systems. Increasingly criticized for being reductionist and not addressing complex systems in a holistic manner, the role that simulations have to play in an increasingly complex world needs to be reimagined and investigated. Moving beyond traditional and current planning methods, this thesis explores the role of simulations, participatory and computational in planning. Recognizing the need for holistic representations of systems in planning, the thesis integrates multiple disparate simulations into a holistic whole, achieving complex representations of a complex systems. These representations are then applied in an interactive environment to address planning problems in different contexts, and studied within their context of use. The thesis makes the following contributions: (i) an approach towards the development of complex representations of systems through distribution and integration, (ii) improvements on participatory methods to integrate computational simulations, (iii) through the different experiments of applying participatory and computational simulations in planning, a nuanced understanding of the relative value of the various constructs of simulations, (iv) technologies and frameworks that facilitate the easy development of integrated simulations that can support participatory planning processes. The thesis develops contributions through experiments, all of which involved planning problems and stakeholders from real world systems. The approach towards development of integrated simulations is realized in an open source framework, that has been applied in several experiments and is now in use in various labs and companies across the world. The framework creates computationally efficient, scalable and interactive simulations of complex large scale systems, which used in a participatory and exploratory manner delivers tangible plans and designs.	algorithmic efficiency;bridging (networking);complex systems;computation;computer simulation;conceptualization (information science);emergence;experiment;holism;integrated development environment;nonlinear system;open-source software;rationality;reductionism;scalability;value (ethics);world-system	Jayanth Raghothama	2017			computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;management science	Robotics	-17.25959157283629	-19.71968785351079	147928

In most manufacturing scenarios, the human involvement is considered one of the critical elements affecting the system performance. In reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs), the workers' tasks are expected to change frequently as the system is reconfigured. The ability to predict the probability of errors caused by human involvement can provide the system designer with insights as to the required skill levels, training programmes, job design, tasks assignment, work organization as well as options for modifying the system design to achieve better quality results. A model for assessing the probability of human errors in RMSs, based on tasks characteristics, work environment, as well as workers capabilities has been developed using the multi-attribute utility analysis. Application of the model to an industrial case study demonstrated its ability to assess, early in the system design and development stage, the probability of errors resulting from human involvement. This is critical in investigating different improvement opportunities to achieve lower levels of errors owing to human involvement, and hence higher quality.	human error	W. H. Elmaraghy;O. A.

Under the paradigm of fuzzy-set theory, a cellular automata model of urban development was developed based on an understanding of the logistic trend of urban development processes. The model assigns membership of urban areas to multiple states of urban development using a fuzzy membership function. The transition rules based on linguistic variables are applied to represent the non-deterministic nature of urban development controls. By implementing the model in a raster based GIS format, experimental scenarios of development of a virtual city under realistic conditions are presented. Experimental application of the model to an artificial city produced realistic results and demonstrated the model was theoretically feasible and valid. Further work is needed to calibrate the model when applying it to simulate actual urban development. In the second part of the two-paper series, spatio-temporal simulations of urban development in Sydney, Australia, from 1971 to 1996 will be demonstrated and discussed. # 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the purpose of an attack is to damage a target network, it also curtails the ability of the attacker, which must choose the duration and magnitude of an attack to avoid negative impacts on its own functioning. Nevertheless, despite the large number of studies on interconnected networks, the consequences of initiating an attack have never been studied. Here, we address this issue by introducing a model of network competition where a resilient network is willing to partially weaken its own resilience in order to more severely damage a less resilient competitor. The attacking network can take over the competitor's nodes after their long inactivity. However, owing to a feedback mechanism the takeovers weaken the resilience of the attacking network. We define a conservation law that relates the feedback mechanism to the resilience dynamics for two competing networks. Within this formalism, we determine the cost and optimal duration of an attack, allowing a network to evaluate the risk of initiating hostilities.	feedback;hostility;interaction;lotka–volterra equations;physical inactivity;prey;semantic network;semantics (computer science)	Boris Podobnik;Davor Horvatic;T.

In realistic group decision situations, however, alternatives are often not specified a priori, but are created during the group process from different components introduced by the group members. This paper develops methods for systematically creating such composite alternatives, taking also into account the necessity to keep both the computational effort and the cognitive load to group members within reasonable limits.	decision support system	Rudolf Vetschera	1994	Annals OR	10.1007/BF02078896	r-cast;group decision-making;optimal decision;decision theory;decision analysis;decision field theory;decision engineering;decision tree;decision rule;mathematics;cognitive load;natural resource economics;evidential reasoning approach;evidential decision theory;group dynamics;weighted sum model;statistics;business decision mapping	ECom	-10.65701614162201	-12.100847530578811	148251
c4406cf94ddb7a0bebeb75f468375181993be478	using the bcd model for risk analysis: an influence diagram based approach	risk analysis;bcd model;influence diagram	In this paper, we are interested in addressing risk analysis. We propose an influence diagram-based approach that focuses on a Benefit, Cost, Deficit (BCD) model. The BCD model is proposed for studying the intentional deviant behaviors of human operators in a system. In this model, the consequences of human actions are analyzed with respect to three parameters: benefit, cost and deficit. Our approach aims to expand the BCD model by integrating factors, such as those related to the organization of the system in question, that influence human operator actions. In addition, the approach considers multiple criteria that are related, for example, to safety and productivity. To build a model that evaluates the risk induced by human actions in a system and analyzes the impact of the different factors, we use influence diagrams. Influence diagrams are probabilistic graphical models that can deal with uncertainty and with incomplete and imprecise information. Influence diagrams also represent the interdependencies between the different variables of the studied problem. In addition, contrary to Bayesian networks, influence diagrams can rank a set of actions by providing information on which action carries the greatest risk or the most benefits. We applied this approach to a case study of an industrial rotary press, but it can also be used in other problems and sectors.	binary-coded decimal;it risk management;influence diagram	Karima Sedki;Philippe Polet;Frédéric Vanderhaegen	2013	Eng.

d5fdee76b9f201bbff29d7aac35c9dec112c93c4	interplay between sir-based disease spreading and awareness diffusion on multiplex networks		Abstract In this paper, we propose a coupled multiplex network framework to model the epidemic spreading and its corresponding information diffusion among a population. In the model, as far as the information perception on the epidemics is concerned, the individuals can be divided into two classes, namely aware or unaware ones; Meanwhile, the awareness diffusion is depicted by utilizing the traditional contact process. From the perspective of infectious disease spreading, the contagion dynamics among nodes can be characterized with the classic SIR (susceptible–infective–recovered) model. Based on the microscopic Markov chain approach, we build the probability tree to describe the switching process between different states, and then intensively perform the theoretical analysis for the state transition. In particular, we analytically derive the epidemic threshold regarding the disease propagation, which is correlated with the multiplex network topology and the coupling relationship between two transmission dynamics. After being compared with extensive numerical Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, it is clearly found that the achieved analytical results concur with the MC simulations. Current results will be beneficial to substantially enhance the predictability of the epidemic outbreaks within many realistic dissemination cases.	multiplexing	Chunyuan Zheng;Chengyi Xia;Quantong Guo;Matthias Dehmer	2018	J.

In this way, a grey-cloud clustering model is proposed for the comprehensive ranking evaluation of flood disaster. The novel method is applied to evaluate the 45 flood disaster cases of several provinces in 1989∼1999, and takes the amount of building collapse, affected area, number of victims, direct economic loss as evaluation indicators. The result shows that this method has much rationality and utility for flood disaster evaluation.	cluster analysis;decorrelation;disaster recovery plan;rationality;structural integrity and failure;weight function;whitening transformation	Yue Chen	2011	Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Electronic & Mechanical Engineering and Information Technology	10.1109/EMEIT.2011.6023416	disaster;weight function;data mining;mathematics;operations research;statistics	Robotics	-9.423514211635458	-21.309278409891746	148610
9c83ec1fb4a4ad39e3050b8e7c0d768652a6f808	integration of z-numbers and bayesian decision theory: a hybrid approach to decision making under uncertainty and imprecision		Abstract For over four decades decision support systems have been emerging to facilitate decision making under uncertain conditions and in a rapidly changing unstructured environment. Most decision support approaches, such as Bayesian decision theory and computing with words (CW), compare and analyze the consequences of different decision alternatives. Bayesian decision methods use probability theory to handle uncertainty and have been widely used in different areas for estimation and prediction as well as offering decision support. On the other hand, computing with words and approximate reasoning apply fuzzy set theory to deal with imprecise measurements and inexact information and are most concerned with propositions stated in natural language. The concept of a Z-number [1] has been recently introduced to represent propositions and their reliability in natural language. This work proposes a methodology that integrates Z-numbers and Bayesian decision theory to provide decision support when precise measurements and exact values of parameters and probabilities are not available. The relationships and computing methods required for such integration are derived and mathematically proved. The proposed hybrid methodology benefits from both approaches and provides a decision support system based on imprecise and uncertain information drawn from natural language. In order to demonstrate the proof of concept, the proposed methodology has been applied to a realistic case study on breast cancer diagnosis.	decision theory	Nina Marhamati;Elham K.

In this study, we focus on examining the following issues. First, we attempt to create synthetic household microdata from a consumer questionnaire survey using both reweighting and imputation approaches. Second, we present the manner in which the results of the spatial microsimulation model are used for market analysis with regard to grocery stores. Market shares, turnover ranking and detailed consumer characteristics for selected stores are examined. In particular, the spatial distributions of households and their shopping behaviour are discussed in order to identify variations in consumer characteristics. As a result, this study shows that a spatial microsimulation model can generate detailed and reliable synthetic microdata from a consumer questionnaire survey. Besides, it is confirmed that this model is a highly relevant approach for implementing market analysis at the small-area level.		Kazumasa Hanaoka;Graham P.

In these systems, environmental flow regimes that are specifically designed to meet environmental management objectives, whilst continuing to support economic needs, may be the best approach. A challenge remains as to how best to design these novel flow regimes. Decision support tools such as optimization provide a potential tool to achieve this. In existing tools environmental outcomes are not represented with sufficient realism and this is a major barrier to successful adoption by decision-makers. Here, we employ conditional probability networks as a promising approach that provides both ease of modelling and a direct link to ecological outcomes and processes. We present a generic model that can be used to represent any ecological endpoint within a river system. We then demonstrate the approach using two fish species in the Yarra River, Victoria.	mathematical optimization	Avril C Horne;Simranjit Kaur;Joanna M. Szemis;Alysson M. Costa;J.

These data are collected in a targeted or a random fashion manner for the purpose of efficient distribution and management in the required timeframe. Urban as well as industrial complexes are typical environments where are generated these data. In this process, there are data that are deliberately collected in order to generate the required reporting and outputs for management decision. Input data are the basis of reporting which can have simple or detailed format. In this work we are collecting random input data with intricate structure that cannot simply interpreted and explain in relation with others. The topic of our paper is focused on the interpretation of collected data that is oriented to energetic resources in regional city. We are describing the process of data collection, data cleaning, analysis, identification of relations, informational links, visualization, and interpretation. By analysis of these data we propose information value, which can be exploited in management decision to reduce the cost of electricity and the gas there.	mathematical optimization	Peter Balco;Martina Drahosová;Peter Kubicko	2018		10.1016/j.procs.2018.04.109	energetics;data collection;work in process;data mining;cost of electricity by source;visualization;computer science	EDA	-15.970974944755461	-20.353877013502892	150020

Conflict management is an open issue in Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. In past decades, a large amount of research has been conducted on this issue. In this paper, we propose a new theory called generalized evidence theory (GET). In comparison with classical evidence theory, GET addresses conflict management in an open world, where the frame of discernment is incomplete because of uncertainty and incomplete knowledge. Within the presented GET, we define a novel concept called generalized basic probability assignment (GBPA) to model uncertain information, and provide a generalized combination rule (GCR) for the combination of GBPAs, and build a generalized conflict model to measure conflict among evidences. Conflicting evidence can be effectively handled using the GET framework. We present many numerical examples that demonstrate that the proposed GET can explain and deal with conflicting evidence more reasonably than existing methods.	numerical analysis;open world;state space	Yong Deng	2015	Applied Intelligence	10.1007/s10489-015-0661-2	dempster–shafer theory;artificial intelligence	AI	-4.8869217807388035	-21.332500119452963	150147

In the proposed SGP model, we naturally incorporates human's personal behavior factor and social correlation factor into a unified model, where basic Gaussian Process model is leveraged to capture individual's personal behavior pattern. Furthermore, we extend the Gaussian Process Model to socialized Gaussian Process (SGP) which aims to capture social correlation phenomena in the social network. The detailed experimental evaluation has shown the SGP model achieves the best prediction accuracy compared with other baseline methods.	baseline (configuration management);behavior model;biometrics;brain–computer interface;gaussian process;hardware description language;simplified perturbations models;social network;socialization;symposium on geometry processing;time series;unified model	Yelong Shen;Ruoming Jin;Dejing Dou;Nafisa Afrin Chowdhury;Junfeng Sun;Brigitte Piniewski;David Kil	2012	2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on Data Mining	10.1109/ICDM.2012.94	econometrics;behavioural sciences;artificial intelligence;machine learning;gaussian process;statistics	ML	-17.42354059200441	-18.625338391610942	150368

For controlling multiple robots, CNP is useful, but the broadcast of task announcement messages on CNP tends to consume much communication load. In order to overcome this problem, the authors have developed a system called LEMMING which learns proper addresses for the task announcement messages with case-based reasoning. However, the learning method used in LEMMING sometimes caused inefficient task execution. In this paper, we propose an extension of LEMMING with message interception which enables the system to execute tasks more efficiently by eavesdropping on leaked message.

Such cooperators will not be punished because they contribute to the public good, but they also eschew the costs associated with punishing defectors. Altruistic punishers—those that cooperate and punish—are at a disadvantage, and it is puzzling how such behaviour has evolved. We show that sharing the responsibility to sanction defectors rather than relying on certain individuals to do so permanently can solve the problem of costly punishment. Inspired by the fact that humans have strong but also emotional tendencies for fair play, we consider probabilistic sanctioning as the simplest way of distributing the duty. In well-mixed populations the public goods game is transformed into a coordination game with full cooperation and defection as the two stable equilibria, while in structured populations pattern formation supports additional counterintuitive solutions that are reminiscent of Parrondoʼs paradox.	humans;pattern formation;picture archiving and communication system;population	Xiaojie Chen;Attila Szolnoki;Matjaž Perc	2014	CoRR	10.1088/1367-2630/16/8/083016	social dynamics;public good;econophysics	ECom	-14.915956371126528	-14.053144940896878	150914
c65fa6b81c132adb1f545c2ff97541cd714bc56c	cooperation and strategy coexistence in a tag-based multi-agent system with contingent mobility	distributed computing;multi agent systems;evolutionary games;mobile complex networks;heuristics;tag based cooperation	Understanding how to enhance cooperation and coordination in distributed, open, and dynamic multiagent systems has been a grand challenge across disciplines. Knowledge employed in such systems is often limited and heuristic in nature such that cooperation-promoting mechanisms based on trust or reputation become largely unreliable. Although recent studies within the context of tag-based systems reported the emergence of stable cooperation in such uncertain environments, they were limited exclusively to only static interaction structures. Consequently, it remains unknown whether and under what conditions tag-based interactions can promote cooperation in dynamic mobile systems. We herein combine the methods of game theory, evolutionary computing, and agent-based simulation to study the emergence of tag-mediated cooperation in a mobile network with resource diversity. In a series of extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we find that tag-based interactions can give rise to high levels of cooperation even in the presence of different types of contingent mobility. Our model reveals that agent migrations within the system and the invasion of new agents from the outside can have similar effects on the evolution of dominant strategies. Interestingly enough, we observe a previously unreported coexistence of conditional and unconditional strategies in our tag-based model with costly migrations. Differently from earlier studies, we show that this mobility-driven strategy coexistence in our model is not affected by resource limitations or other game-specific factors. Our findings highlight a striking robustness of tagbased cooperation under different mobility regimes, with important consequences for the future design of cooperation-enforcing protocols in large-scale, decentralized, and self-organizing systems such as peerto-peer or mobile ad-hoc networks. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.	agent-based model;agent-based social simulation;coexist (image);contingency (philosophy);emergence;evolutionary computation;game theory;grand challenges;heuristic;hoc (programming language);interaction;monte carlo method;multi-agent system;organizing (structure);peer-to-peer;self-organization	Tarik Hadzibeganovic;Cheng-Yi Xia	2016	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2016.08.024	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;heuristics;multi-agent system	AI	-15.568116815131216	-14.01260490950671	151488

Our main research hypothesis is that the membership in cooperation networks is related to the degree of the knowledge spillover. The approach has two scenarios: cost symmetry and cost asymmetry. We first develop an analytical model with three stages: firstly, firms decide whether to participate in a cooperative research network; secondly they simultaneously choose the level of R&D output, and finally they choose the level of output. Then we proceed with computational simulations to verify our hypothesis. From our results, we were able to conclude that cooperation leads to an improvement on RJV firms’ position in the market as they produce more than others with the same production conditions. Additionally, cooperating firms have to spend fewer resources on research, which turns the network a tremendous success on the productive efficiency level.	computation;computer simulation;knowledge spillover	Duarte Leite;Pedro Campos;Isabel Mota	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23330-2_55	industrial organization;computer simulation;spillover effect;cournot competition;economics;computer science;productive efficiency;marketing;operations management;management;commerce	AI	-6.768414928997955	-10.383452668817633	151625
dd5733f5f45622a49e4280e906debb2611e1045d	application of the ranking relative principal component attributes network model (rel-pcanet) for the inclusive development index estimation		In 2018, at the World Economic Forum in Davos it was presented a new countries’ economic performance metric named the Inclusive Development Index (IDI) composed of 12 indicators. The new metric implies that countries might need to realize structural reforms for improving both economic expansion and social inclusion performance. That is why, it is vital for the IDI calculation method to have strong statistical and mathematical basis, so that results are accurate and transparent for public purposes. In the current work, we propose a novel approach for the IDI estimation the Ranking Relative Principal Component Attributes Network Model (REL-PCANet). The model is based on RELARM and RankNet principles and combines elements of PCA, techniques applied in image recognition and learning to rank mechanisms. Also, we define a new approach for estimation of target probabilities matrix TRnet to reflect dynamic changes in countries’ inclusive development. Empirical study proved that REL-PCANet ensures reliable and robust scores and rankings, thus is recommended for practical implementation.	computer vision;interdependence;learning to rank;network model;rel;relevance;rights expression language	Anwar Irmatov;Elnura Irmatova	2018	CoRR		learning to rank;empirical research;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;matrix (mathematics);network model;principal component analysis;performance metric;ranking;economic expansion	Web+IR	-7.992525292108588	-18.35654512099086	151727

I n this approach, the focus is on concrete cases or episodes, rather than on basic principles. Past problem solving experience is recorded as a collection of solution instances indezed using a set of labels. When a new problem is presented, the case-based reasoner searches its case reposito y and retrieves an old record that closely matches the current context. In the proposed scheme, we employ fuzzy sets to represent case indices and fuzzy aggregation functions to evaluate cases. This provides a formal scheme to quantify the partial matches of a given problem with multiple cases in the database and t o utilize these partial matches to compute an aggregated result. Cost estimation and risk assessment functions of software project management are covered here. The paper discusses the basic principles of case-based reasoning and provides a functaonal description of the proposed system with details of case representation and case evaluation strategies.	aggregate function;case-based reasoning;fuzzy set;problem solving;risk assessment;semantic reasoner;software project management	C.

The goal of a recommendation system is to provide advice either on request or pro-actively. In this paper, we assume that the value of an advice from another agent is determined by the trust in that other agent. We present a trust-based model of collaboration and decision making in a multi-agent system. We assume however that agents may be dishonest (such an agent is called an intruder), resulting in advices that may be false. The goal of this paper is the detection of intruders, thereby minimising the damage that they can cause. We also present the underlying relational database model and use this to build a prototype. In our tests, we show that the more influential an agent is in the multi-agent system, measured as its CreditRank, the faster that agent will be unmasked would it be an intruder.	intrusion detection system;recommender system	Eric D.

There are two main paths through which social control can be applied: punishment and reputation. Using a Public Goods Game, we show that gossip, used for assortment under three different strategies, can be effective in large groups, whereas its efficacy is reduced in small groups, with no main effect of the gossiping strategy. We also test four different combinations of gossip and costly punishment, showing that a combination of punishment and reputation-based partner selection leads to higher cooperation rates.	agent-based model	Francesca Giardini;Mario Paolucci;Diana F.

FCMs are ideal causal cognition tools for modeling and simulating dynamic systems. Their usefulness has been proved from their wide applicability in diverse domains. They gained momentum due to their simplicity, flexibility to model design, adaptability to different situations, and ease of use. In general, they model the behavior of a complex system utilizing experts knowledge and/or available knowledge from existing databases. They are mainly used for knowledge representation and decision support where their modeling features and their learning capabilities make them efficient to support these tasks. This chapter gathers the methods and learning algorithms of FCMs applied to modeling and decision making tasks. A comprehensive survey of the current modeling methodologies and learning algorithms of FCMs is presented. The leading methods and learning algorithms, concentrated on modeling, are described analytically and analyzed presenting experimental results of a known case study. The main features of computational methodologies are compared and future research directions are outlined.	algorithm;fuzzy cognitive map	Elpiniki I. Papageorgiou;Jose L.

And expert managers of front-line workers must design more complex human resource strategies that take into consideration the workers’ skills. However, tacit knowledge existing only in the minds of expert managers is very difficult to capture with most organizations depending entirely on the explicit knowledge. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to develop a model with a bayesian network using the operation histories of expert managers, and to verify some factors that would make it easier for nonexperts to assign human resources. First, the operation histories are collected. Next, some differences of human resource planning procedures for expert managers and nonexperts are discussed by dividing into the purposes of either minimizing makespan or workload. Finally, the effectiveness of the expert managers’ operations is verified by constructing a bayesian network model based on the operation histories, and is discussed by way of probabilistic inference.	bayesian network;enterprise resource planning;makespan;network model	Takayuki Kataoka;Kazumoto Tanaka;Masakazu Kanezashi;Makoto Hasegawa	2012			influence diagram;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining	AI	-7.425375755539198	-15.043589489680263	152397

The United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) recognizes that behavioral change of society is needed to significantly reduce disaster losses. There is a need therefore in empirical understanding of human behavior during disasters as this could help in making decisions on how to prepare for disasters, how to properly act and strategically respond during and after a calamity. This study aims to understand human behavior during disaster through agent-based modeling and social network analysis. eBayanihan, a disaster management platform that uses crowdsourcing to gather disaster-related information was used to capture disaster behavior during a simulated disaster-event. Survey data was also used for disaster behavior modeling. Generated disaster behavior models and computed social network centrality measures using ORA-Netscenes shows that there are specific agents in the network that can play an important role during disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) operations.	agent-based model;bayesian network;behavior model;centrality;consistency model;crowdsourcing;simulation;social network analysis	Rey C.

3884b3cf107fdaacb3fa4b25bc55034cde551826	a 1: 1000 scale model of the digital world: global connectivity can lead to the extinction of local networks		The overwhelming success of online social networks, the key actors in the cosmos of the Web 2.0, has reshaped human interactions on a worldwide scale. To understand the fundamental mechanisms which determine the fate of online social networks at the system level, we recently introduced a general ecological theory of the digital world. In this paper, we discuss the impact of heterogeneity in the network intrinsic fitness and present how the general theory can be applied to understand the competition between an international network, like Facebook, and local services. To this end, we construct a 1:1000 scale model of the digital world enclosing the 80 countries with most Internet users. We find that above a certain threshold the level of global connectivity can lead to the extinction of local networks. In addition, we reveal the complex role the tendency of individuals to engage in more active networks plays for the probability of local networks to become extinct and provide insights into the conditions under which they can prevail.	active networking;interaction;social network;web 2.0;world wide web	Kaj-Kolja Kleineberg;Marián Boguñá	2015	CoRR			ML	-14.895021268748497	-17.03944346377177	153097

Individuals adapt to the environment using only locally available information. We show that a simple parameter adaptation is an effective way to improve the efficiency of the group and that it brings forth division of labor between the members of the group. Moreover, robots that are best at retrieving have a higher probability of becoming active retrievers. This selection of the best members does not use any explicit representation of individual capabilities.

A http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2012.03.008 ⇑ Corresponding author. Tel.: +86 21 34206675. E-mail address: yangdong@dhu.edu.cn (D. Yang). Product configuration is an essential means for selecting various components to constitute a customized product with the aim of meeting the individualized requirements of a customer. Nevertheless, configuration conflicts may occur when too strict requirements of the customer are given and thus any configuration cannot be found to satisfy the customer requirements. In this situation, it is vital important for a product configurator to recommend the corrective actions for generating valid configurations. In this paper, we present a method of applying constraint satisfaction to resolve product configuration conflicts. In the presented approach, the configuration conflict problem is encoded as a CSP (constraint satisfaction problem). Therefore, the resolution to the configuration conflict problem can be regarded as solving a CSP. As a consequence, corrective actions such as removing selected components or adding new components are suggested by the system. In the case of multiple resolving strategies, a multi-objective decision model is adopted to find the optimal repair strategy according to customer preferences. A computer configuration is illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented approach. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Low Carbon City (LCC) can be achieved by combining appropriate land use and transportation. We simulate the possible low carbon city by combining spatially explicit land use equilibrium (LUE) model and agent-based traffic model. First, land use scenarios of a city with different urban forms (compact and dispersed etc.) are created using the LUE model. Then the corresponding transportation is projected under each urban form with a large-scale traffic simulator for a case study city (Yokohama) in Japan. We also simulate the current traffic using the detailed person-trip data. Finally, we analyze the relationship between the urban form and the resulting CO2 emission both from land use and transportation are estimated. The proposed method can be a useful tool for urban planners to test some land use and transportation policies for designing sustainable cities.	agent-based model;simulation	Hideyuki Mizuta;Yoshiki Yamagata;Hajime Seya	2012	Proceedings Title: Proceedings of the 2012 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)		land-use planning;transport;environmental engineering;civil engineering;transport engineering;design for the environment;air pollution	HCI	-15.071462925772819	-23.028755039270315	153436
1185217672a2a8481b75f032de9ea0f4155d0a0d	making decisions through preference-based argumentation		Decision making is usually based on the comparative evaluation of different alternatives by means of a decision criterion. The whole decision process is compacted into a criterion formula on the basis of which alternatives are compared. It is thus, impossible for an end user to understand why an alternative is good, or better than another. Recently, some decision criteria were articulated in terms of a two-steps argumentation process: i) an inference step in which arguments in favor/against each option are built and evaluated, and ii) a comparison step in which pairs of alternatives are compared on the basis of “accepted” arguments. Thus, not only the best alternative is provided to the user but also the reasons justifying this recommendation. However, a two steps approach is not in accordance with the principle of an argumentation system, whose accepted arguments are intended to support the “good” options. Moreover, with such an approach it is difficult to define proof procedures for testing directly whether a given option may be the best one without computing the whole ordering. Finally, it is difficult to analyze how an ordering is revised in light of a new argument. This paper proposes a novel approach for argumentationbased decision making. We propose a Dung style system that takes as input different arguments and a defeat relation among them, and returns as outputs a status for each option, and a total preordering on a set of options. The status is defined on the basis of different inference mechanisms. The total preordering privileges the option that is supported by the strongest argument, provided that this argument survives to the attacks. The properties of the system are investigated.	eisenstein's criterion	Leila Amgoud;Yannis Dimopoulos;Pavlos Moraitis	2008			artificial intelligence;algorithm;decision matrix	AI	-5.044757714747007	-19.815166844654517	153502

Among the top housing concerns is insufficient protection from extreme heat. Developing nations face particular risk in hotarid climates as many citizens, constrained by limited access to resources, build informal settlements that are ill-equipped to shield them from harsh environments. In May 2015, an estimated 2,500 Indian citizens lost their lives as a result of a deadly heatwave [2]. With global climate change and rapid urbanization, the need to build economically viable housing that provides shelter from extreme heatwaves arises. Prior work provides a wealth of knowledge on passive cooling techniques. However, these techniques have rarely been applied in the context of the developing world due to material constraints and poor design integration. The following report presents the findings from a collaboration between MIT and Hunnarshala, a NGO located in Gujarat, India. The paper investigates the design and implementation of passive cooling techniques in a case study city, Bhuj, India. Through data analysis and the evaluations of appropriate affordable designs, a new multilayered roof design emerged.

53b4ae4eb054ab912a3f9a90ccccc6b884090a55	evolutionary voluntary prisoner's dilemma game under deterministic and stochastic dynamics	voluntary prisoner s dilemma;quasi birth and death process;evolutionary dynamic	The voluntary prisoner’s dilemma (VPD) game has sparked interest from various fields since it was proposed as an effective mechanism to incentivize cooperative behavior. Current studies show that the inherent cyclic dominance of the strategies of the VPD game results in periodic oscillations in population. This paper investigated the influence of the level of individual rationality and the size of a population on the evolutionary dynamics of the VPD game. Different deterministic dynamics, such as the replicator dynamic, the Smith dynamic, the Brown-von Neumann-Nash (BNN) dynamic and the best response (BR) dynamic, for the evolutionary VPD game were modeled and simulated. The stochastic evolutionary dynamics based on quasi birth and death (QBD) process was proposed for the evolutionary VPD game and compared with deterministic dynamics. The results indicated that with the increase of the loners’ fixed payoff, the loner is more likely to remain in the stable state of a VPD game under any of the dynamics mentioned above. However, the different speeds of motion under the dynamics in the cycle dominance proved to be diverse under different evolutionary dynamics and also highly sensitive to the rationality of individuals in a population. Furthermore, in QBD stochastic dynamics, the size of the population has a remarkable effect on the possibility distribution. When the population size increases, the limited distribution of the QBD process will be in accordance with the results in the deterministic dynamics.

The IWRAM software integrates a crop model with hydrological and economic models. Presented here is the integrated crop model, called CATCHCROP, which is capable of simulating yield response to water deficit and fertility depletion. External and internal constraints have largely influenced the model construction. Paucity of observed data and its reliability required the use of conceptual and recognized algorithms. Linkages with the economic and hydrological models led to the choice of a 10-days time step. The standalone version of the model has been tested against available data sets coming from two small catchments. First results are fairly satisfactory but it is acknowledged that this kind of integrated model should not be used at the farm plot level to assess cropping practices. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

69123efe596dda701d505897518d45fe071cdb3b	assessing the vulnerability of agricultural crops to riverine floods in kalibo, philippines using composite index method		Evaluating the vulnerability of a system can serve as an effective planning tool in increasing resilience to a certain hazard. In this study, a vulnerability assessment of agricultural crops to river flooding in Kalibo, a municipality in Aklan, Philippines, was performed. The analysis included physical, agro-ecological, and socio-economic indicators clustered under the components of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Indicators relevant for a composite index measuring degree of vulnerability to flooding were identified and corresponding weights were determined using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Various datasets were acquired using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing and participatory methods such as focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs). The barangay-level (village-level) and gridded (500m x 500m) vulnerability maps produced using Index Method and GIS were validated through field surveys and by comparison with historical accounts of disasters and their corresponding impacts on agricultural productivity. It was concluded that the most exposed barangays were those near bodies of water and having vast agricultural land cover. Though the physical and environmental attributes of an area are substantial in determining risk, the vulnerability of the subject area was shown to be influenced by its internal (exposure) and external (sensitivity and adaptive capacity) factors. Thus, knowing and acting on indicators that are within human influence is essential in minimizing the effects of inevitable and uncontrollable	algorithm;composite index (database);ecology;flood;focus group;geodetic datum;geographic information system;hazard (computer architecture);map;photogrammetry;sensitivity and specificity	Ronalyn P.

A particular company can be viewed as a dynamical system evolving in time and also competing with similar companies for the market of their products. Also, within an international trade agreement there are also competing companies from foreign countries, which complicates the problem even more. We can apply our new method for automated simulation (O. Castillo and P. Melin, 1998) to simulate the evolution of a company or a group of companies as they compete for a fixed market. As a result of these simulations, we can formulate specific mathematical conditions for a specific country to go bankrupt or specific conditions for another company to have success.	simulation	Oscar Castillo;Patricia Melin	2000		10.1109/CIFER.2000.844608	simulation;computer science;operations management;management science	Robotics	-8.568176586125656	-11.108096543966129	154401

Fuzzy multi-rules and fuzzy multi-sets are used to evaluate the main operational characteristics of six types of RET fuelled by biogas from municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. The construction of the fuzzy multi-rules and fuzzy multi-sets is based on the following method: Mamdani controller using the Max-Min (inference process) and Center of Gravity (defuzzification process). Several criteria are used for the investigation: costs, efficiency, cogeneration, life-cycle and environmental impacts. The fuzzybased expert system considers three different settings with two different constraints: costs and environmental impacts. One of the most relevant aspects presented by this work is about the previous criteria rank. It was created according to the different relevance observed among the attributes. The purpose of the proposed arrangement is to facilitate the understanding of the methodology and to increase the possibility of incorporating the decision makers’ preferences on the decision-aid process. These aspects are essential to strengthen the final decision.	defuzzification;expert system;fuzzy set;microwave;relevance;resolution enhancement technology	Alexandre Barin;Luciane N.

Scenario development is one starting point of this assessment, and generates inqui~ about the present state and fiture evolution of the disposal system. Scenario development consists of four tasks: (i) identi&ing and classifying features, events and processes (FEPs), (ii) screening FEPs according to well-defined criten~ (iii) forming scenarios (combinations of FEPs) in the context of regulatory performance criteria and (iv) specifying of scenarios for consequence amdysis. The development and screening of a comprehensive FEP list provides assurance that the identification of significant processes and events is complete, that potential interactions between FEPs are not overlooked, and that responses to possible questions are available and well documented. Two basic scenarios have been identified for the WIPP: undisturbed performance (IIP) and disturbed performance (DP). The UP scenario is used to evaluate compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) Individual Dose (40 CFR$191 -15) and Groundwater Protection (40 CFR $191 .24) standards and accounts for all natural and wasteand repository-induced FEPs that survive the screening process. The DP scenario is required for assessment calculations for the EPA’s cumulative release standard (Containment Requirements, 40 CFR ~191.13) and accounts for disruptive future human events, which have an uncertain probability of occurrence, in addition to the UP FEPs.	interaction;waste	Daniel A.

The proposed model not only determines a manufacturing company’s overall performance within its industry but also obtains its strengths and weaknesses in critical activities. It lets one to combine a company’s performance scores in seventeen critical activities with important industry-specific objectives to obtain a single overall performance score by using a 4-Point Fuzzy Scale and a modified fuzzy version of the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution approach. The calculated overall performance scores provide a ranking order among manufacturing companies within their industry. In addition, it also enables each company to compare its performance in critical activities with respect to other companies in its industry. Furthermore, the performance measurement model has the capability to determine what a company should do to improve its performance in critical activities. This paper provides an example to illustrate the application of the proposed model.

In order to apprehend such phenomena, agent based urban simulations can be used. In this context, the increasing availability of 3D urban data can be put to use for simulations so as to gain a finer understanding of urban evolutions. We propose a novel approach integrating 3D data and their analysis combined with urban regulation rules during the different steps of the simulation: the creation of spatio-temporal databases, the qualification of the urban fabric and buildings simulation. A potential application of such a simulator for the support of urban rules parameters choice is proposed.

Firstly, the proposed approach uses the service blueprint to analyse the service process of coffee shops and the working times of the required direct facilities and the supporting facilities to estimate the amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. By using data envelopment analysis, the holistic performance evaluation model of environmentally sustainable service operation for coffee shops is created to find the non-benchmark environmentally sustainable service coffee shops. To improve environmentally sustainable service performance of the non-benchmark coffee shops, this paper evaluates the environmentally sustainable performance evaluation models of the meal-ordering and cooking areas and dining areas. Finally, this research gives an in depth analysis to comprehend the decreasing amount of the CF of each facility in the non-benchmark environmentally sustainable service areas.	benchmark (computing);bloom (shader effect);blueprint;carbon cycle;data envelopment analysis;holism;national supercomputer centre in sweden;performance evaluation	Tzu-An Chiang;Shen-Tsu Wang	2016	IJTM	10.1504/IJTM.2016.074646	greenhouse gas;operations management	Metrics	-12.317518401596393	-23.29631665350451	156276
00e8586fd8105f836492560cf35f928b61f90b93	emergence of balance from a model of social dynamics		We propose a model for social dynamics on a network. In this model each actor holds a position on some issue, actors and their opinions being associated to vertices of the graph, and, additionally, the actors hold opinions of one another, with these opinions being associated to edges in the graph. These quantities are allowed to evolve according to the gradient flow of a natural free energy. We show that for a small spread in opinions the model converges to a consensus state, where all actors hold the same position. For a larger spread in opinion there is a phase transition marked by the birth of a second stable state: in addition to the consensus state there is a second polarized or partisan state. This state, when it exists, is conjectured to be global energy minimizer, with the consensus state being a local energy minimizer. We derive an energy inequality which supports this. Interestingly, all of the steady states we find, with the exception of the consensus state, are either balanced (in the sense of Heider) or are completely unbalanced states where all triangles are unbalanced. The latter solutions are, not surprisingly, always unstable.	emergence;social dynamics	Ikemefuna Agbanusi;Jared C.

73b6c04ee7f26f74da5e2479197d33c24b4a529c	the iterated hawk-dove game revisited: the effect of ownership uncertainty on bourgeois as a pure convention	resource holding potential;evolution of private property;animal conflict	Classical evolutionary game theory shows that respect for ownership (“Bourgeois” behavior) can arise as an arbitrary convention to avoid costly disputes, but the same theory also predicts that a paradoxical disrespect for ownership (“anti-Bourgeois” behavior) can evolve under the same conditions. Given the rarity of the latter strategy in the natural world, it is clear that the classical model is lacking in some important biological details. For instance, the classical model assumes that roles of owner and intruder can be recognized unambiguously. However, in the natural world there is often confusion over ownership, mediated for example by the temporary absence of the owner. We show that if intruders sometimes believe themselves to be owners, then the resulting confusion over ownership can broaden the conditions under which Bourgeois behavior is evolutionarily stable in the one-shot Hawk–Dove game. Likewise, introducing mistakes over ownership into a more realistic game with repeated interactions facilitates the evolution of Bourgeois behavior where previously such a result could arise only if owners are intrinsically more likely to win fights than intruders. Collectively, therefore, we find that mistakes over ownership facilitate the evolution of Bourgeois behavior.

Users deal with an overwhelming number of alternatives, and continuously make decisions anytime they want to obtain meaningful information. The paper describes an approach for a simple yet effective selection of the most suitable information that fits user's needs. The novelty of the approach is twofold: the concept of lexicographical-like preferences used for a multi-criteria decision-making with elements of fuzziness and OWA operator; a simple fuzzy number based mechanism for estimating user's degrees of acceptance of criterion satisfaction. The lexicographic preferences allow for mimicking user's attitude that some criteria should be satisfied before other criteria are considered. The acceptance of criterion satisfaction levels are defined with a single threshold that represents a boundary value between acceptable and unacceptable values of attributes of alternatives. The paper includes results of a simple case study preformed on a prototype of a web selection system built using the proposed approach.	anytime algorithm;fits;fuzzy number;information source;internet;lexicographic preferences;lexicography;prototype	Ronald R.

86c3cf72a60bb981b956a4edd40c8810e69eddc5	analysis of public opinion heat trend in universities on the basis of markov chain		With the development of the information age, Micro-blog, as the main carrier and platform of public opinion in universities, has gradually increased its influence. Focusing on the high fluctuation of public opinion in universities and other certain characters, this paper proposes a predictive model of public opinion heat trend based on Markov chain. In this model, it collects some index data and gives out time series of the public opinion heat value; then classifies the state space of public opinion heat trend in universities; thirdly, constructs state transition matrix of public opinion heat; and lastly, forecasts the trend variation interval of public opinion heat. Finally, the experimental results show that such model can effectively predict the trend of public opinion in universities and guide and manage them, providing a theoretical model basis for effect appraisal of public opinion in universities.

The first step of the method involves using Reason’s model of organisational failures. This provides heuristic guidance in identifying both the active and latent conditions that lead to major failures. The second step involves applying formal methods to support a detailed analysis of each latent and active condition. The method is demonstrated on a case study: the railway accident at Watford Junction in the United Kingdom. Analysis of the formal model helps to identify organisational factors that might have prevented the accident. It also helps to identify weaknesses in the report itself. In particular we argue that a signalling standard was misunderstood, the consequences of which could lead to another serious accident.	formal methods;heuristic;high- and low-level;language of temporal ordering specification;mathematical model;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;simulation	Chris W.

Security is a very important issue when different users have potential access to operations of various databases of a system. There are benefits and risks involved in allowing these accesses overtime. Assuming that the probability of a user being hostile may be crisp or fuzzy is partially known, we implement fuzzy linear programming to maximize the benefits while keeping the loss under a certain fuzzy limit within the time allocation for each user. Furthermore, we develop an approach using fuzzy cognitive map to help estimate the probability of the user being hostile. In the paper, we use a specific model for simplicity in illustrating our methodology but the model can be extended to general problems of allocation of resources in a highly sensitive information distributed system such as online banking.

The epidemic potential from trade involves both intra-proliferation and inter-diffusion. Here, we present a worldwide vegetable trade network and a stochastic computational model to simulate global trade-mediated epidemics by considering the weighted nodes and edges of the network and the dual-scale dynamics of epidemics. We address two basic issues of network structural impact in global epidemic patterns: (1) in contrast to the prediction of heterogeneous network models, the broad variability of node degree and edge weights of the vegetable trade network do not determine the threshold of global epidemics; (2) a ‘penetration effect’, by which community structures do not restrict propagation at the global scale, quickly facilitates bridging the edges between communities, and leads to synchronized diffusion throughout the entire network. We have also defined an appropriate metric that combines dual-scale behavior and enables quantification of the critical role of bridging edges in disease diffusion from widespread trading. The unusual structure mechanisms of the trade network model may be useful in producing strategies for adaptive immunity and reducing international trade frictions.	bridging (networking);complex network;computation;computational model;control theory;heart rate variability;network model;penetration test;real-time web;simulation;software propagation;system analysis	Xiaogang Jin;Yong Min	2014	Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE C	10.1631/jzus.C1300243	simulation;computer science;operations research	ML	-12.453489602315413	-17.297926338178513	157722

Based on this self-maintenance ability, they reproduce systems of similar organization. This two-fold property forms unique hierarchical organizations, foreign to physical systems. This paper explores how the living world is organized by the two-fold property, where two types of hierarchical organizations, or part–whole relationships, are distinguished: one is synchronic participation in organizing an entity; the other is diachronic. The former implies that the composition of an entity is fixed through time, regardless of organizational patterns, while the latter involves changes in composition to maintain a pattern. Both types of organization are mathematically formalized, and organizational hierarchies of the living world are analyzed in biological space–time. This analysis reveals that biological systems are arrayed in a complex two-dimensional hierarchical ma...	living systems;synchronicity	Toshiyuki Nakajima	2004	Int. J.

cba0444dc1490bd11b606067b7f0f852c75fe18a	kaizen selection for continuous improvement through vsm-fuzzy-topsis in small-scale enterprises: an indian case study		In the era of cut throat competitive market, Indian industries are under tremendous pressure to continuously reduce the cost and improve product quality. The main objective of this research paper is to provide a road map for investigating the opportunities to reduce cost and improve productivity and quality in the existing production system through the application of Lean-Kaizen concept using value stream mapping (VSM) tool at shop floor of an Indian Small-Scale Enterprise (SSE). On the basis of collected data from the selected industry, a current state map was made. After analysis, the current state map was modified to develop a future state map. By comparing current and future state map, the gap areas were identified and takt time (TT) was calculated considering actual market demand. To overcome the gap between current state map and future state map and to synchronize cycle time of each station with talk time, Kaizen event (KE) was proposed. Fuzzy technology for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) was applied to prioritize and select the appropriate KE for optimized performance level. After analysis of data obtained after application of the Lean-Kaizen concept, the final improvements in terms of improved productivity (57.15%) and reduced lead time (69.47%), reduced cost (65.61%), and station cycle time (75.25%) were recorded. Through the case study drawn from realistic situations of the industry, the authors highlight that implementation of Lean-Kaizen using VSM and fuzzy TOPSIS provides improvement opportunities across the organization. The findings can inspire the SSEs to adopt the Lean-Kaizen concept for optimizing continuous improvement opportunities in their production industry. This study offers the researchers and practitioners a good example for understanding, selecting, and performing KE program. They can even attain more improvement in various areas by establishing or improving these KE programs.	knowledge engineering;production system (computer science);reduced cost;viable system model	Sunil Kumar;Ashwani Kumar Dhingra;Bhim Singh	2018	Adv.

In PDIGA, the synchronization of the generations is necessary among the subpopulations or users. Therefore, PDIGA is not appropriate for the situation with a large number of people in separate areas. In this paper, we propose Global Asynchronous Distributed Interactive Genetic Algorithm (GADIGA) as an algorithm for creating better design solutions with many people without synchronization. It is found that the asynchronous evolution is effective for making satisfying design solutions with the use of a database of elite individuals. Moreover, it is found that the users can generate more excellent design solutions by repeating the design process because better elite solutions are accumulated in the elite database. For two groups with different sensibilities, it is found that the exchange of design solutions between the groups is less than the one in the groups, but the exchange between the groups plays an important role. From the experimental results, GADIGA is found to be effective for creating better design solutions with many people in separate areas.	authentication;database;experiment;genetic algorithm;in-game advertising;population;synchronicity	Mitsunori Miki;Yuki Yamamoto;Sanae H.

It provides service, parts, and financial solutions to commercial and residential customers worldwide. In this paper, we showcase results of combining classic lean techniques, such as value stream mapping, with operations research analytics, including statistical and simulation modeling, to dramatically improve the manufacturing of a problematic feeder component assigned to a dedicated manufacturing process. We first used value stream mapping to visualize the process and develop an overall lean strategy for the manufacturing cell. We then used regression analysis to express the relationship between numerous product attributes and improvement opportunities. Finally, we developed simulation models to assess the effectiveness of process changes on cell performance under a wide range of demand and processing conditions prevalent at the plant. Process improvement recommendations presented to Trane management included 1 a redesigned material strategy, 2 a new cell layout, and 3 a one-piece product flow. In combination, these improvements facilitate a 13 percent throughput improvement, 50 percent cycle-time reduction, and higher cell efficiency that led to projected recurring savings of more than $700,000 per year.	operations research;rand index	John B.

Recent studies have been overly focused on ways that the power-law connectivity distribution features of social networks affect epidemic dynamics and spreading situations. Two important factors have been overlooked as a result: resource limitations and transmission costs associated with face-to-face interactions and daily contact. Our two main findings are: (a) a significant critical threshold does exist when resources and costs are taken into consideration, and that threshold has a lower bound whenever contagion events occur in scale-free social networks; and (b) the spread of epidemics in scale-free social networks remains controllable as long as resources are properly restricted and consumed costs in the form of public health strategies are significantly increased.	computer simulation;emoticon;interaction;social network	Yu-Shiuan Tsai;Chuen-Tsai Sun;Chung-Yuan Huang	2008	2008 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology	10.1109/WIIAT.2008.11	probability distribution;simulation;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;software agent;scale-free network;mathematical model;management science;complex network;health care;statistics	Robotics	-16.26081035540626	-17.832206813977383	158298

There are various levels of friendships. According to the level of social interaction, different degrees of sympathy and interaction frequency exist. This paper purports to examine how interaction frequency influences the development of sympathy factor, and thereby the emergence of social action patterns in an agent-based simulation model when learning takes place locally. In our artificial society, an agent frequently interacts with other agents who are closely located, and infrequently with those who are remotely located. By endogenizing the sympathy factor based on behavioral patterns of the agents, we examine how the interaction frequency affects patterns of emerging social actions. The results obtained are as follows: (1) the closer the distance and the relationship between agents, the more cooperative the behavior of agents are; (2) since cooperative behaviors promote the emotion of sympathy, frequent interactions induce more cooperative behaviors through strengthening sympathy than they do without this effect of sympathy. (1) and (2) together give rise to three patterns of social behaviors: cooperation with tolerance among players who are in a close relationship, reciprocal cooperation among players in a moderately close relationship, and no coorperation among strangers.	agent-based model;behavioral pattern;emergence;intelligent agent;interaction;prisoner's dilemma;simulation	Ichiro Takahashi;Isamu Okada	2005	Proceedings of the 38th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2005.571	simulation;stability;resonance;adaptive control;social behavior;process control;prisoner's dilemma	HCI	-16.029074251214336	-15.242777120190125	158637

This study presents a methodology that audits the bikeability level of the urban road environment across three selected routes in the city of Volos, Greece. This methodology is a useful toolkit in order to evaluate and improve the bikeability level of the urban road environment and also evaluate existing bikeways. Four suitably trained auditors rode their bikes and evaluated the bikeability level using an audit tool in order to audit specific features that influence bicycling suitability across the road segments and intersections of the selected routes. Furthermore, the auditors graded specific features of the road environment in order to set a bikeability score for each tested route. Finally, this study concludes that the bikeability level of the selected routes was moderate and certain actions are necessary in order to be improved.

We have simulated an agent-based open and decentralised P2P system which self-organises itself into different groups to avoid cooperative sharers being exploited by uncooperative free riders. This approach encourages sharers to move to better groups and restricts free riders into those groups of sharers without needing centralised control. Our approach is suitable for current P2P systems that are open and distributed. Gossip is used as a social mechanism for information sharing which facilitates the formation of groups. Using multi-agent based simulations we demonstrate how the adaptive behaviour of agents lead to self-organisation. We have tested with varying the gossip level and checked its impact in the system’s behaviour. We have also investigated the impact of false gossip in this system where gossip is the medium for information sharing which leads to self-organisation.	adaptive behavior;agent-based model;centralisation;cooperative multitasking;declaration (computer programming);multi-agent system;peer-to-peer;scalability;self-organization;simulation;software deployment;springer (tank);word lists by frequency	Sharmila Savarimuthu;Maryam Purvis;Martin K.

04de5676b370a1b277686b5694bab828ec341aa4	a comprehensive assessment approach to evaluate the trustworthiness of manufacturing services in cloud manufacturing environment		Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) is an innovative manufacturing paradigm in which geographically distributed various manufacturing resources are encapsulated into manufacturing services (MSs), and also these MSs can provide users with various services. Users can find and choose qualified MSs to form cliques to help them complete their manufacturing tasks via Internet. Trust makes cooperative endeavors happen. Hence, it is an important problem to evaluate the trustworthiness of MSs in CMfg. In this paper, we present a comprehensive assessment approach to evaluate the trustworthiness of a MS in CMfg. The approach evaluates a MS from both objective and subjective perspectives, named as credit assessment and reliability assessment, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression analysis is presented to assess the credit of a MS, while fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is used to assess its reliability. Finally, a case study is presented and the results show the comprehensive assessment approach is efficacious at the trustworthiness evaluation of a MS.	analytical hierarchy;clique (graph theory);cloud manufacturing;internet;multinomial logistic regression;programming paradigm;trust (emotion)	Ping Lou;Liping Yuan;Jiwei Hu;Junwei Yan;Jian Lin Fu	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2837664	fuzzy logic;data mining;trustworthiness;cloud computing;multinomial logistic regression;distributed computing;the internet;cloud manufacturing;analytic hierarchy process;computer science	SE	-7.786782015190376	-17.726182467893604	159561

However, to reach a consensus individual preferences are frequently lost. Conflict is generally avoided because of the negative influence it could have on the success of collective movements. However, it could be used to balance consensus costs with individual preferences. Using a biologically-based collective movement model, this work investigates the possibility of conflict in a group movement allowing for differing individual goals to be accomplished, while still maintaining group cohesion much of the time. Individuals focus on their own needs, which may include the protection of being a part of a group or the desire to move away from the group and towards its preferred destination. Results show that by allowing conflict in group decision-making, consensus costs were balanced with individual preferences in such a way that group level success still occurred, while significantly improving the success of differing goals.	cohesion (computer science);group cohesiveness;robot	Timothy Solum;Brent E.

b1d3d123dcc1f083255c3b6f61aabd1b090ff70a	divergence measures as a generalised approach to quantitative emergence		A technical system exhibits emergence when it has certain properties or qualities that can be termed to be irreducible in the sense that they are not traceable down to the constituent parts of the system. The article summarises three techniques for emergence detection and emergence measurement that were proposed by members of the Organic Computing community. These techniques are based on information-theoretic and probabilistic viewpoints: the discrete entropy difference discussed in detail in the previous article, the Hellinger distance which is a divergence measure for probability densities, and an iterative approach motivated by divergence measures. Advantages and drawbacks of these measures are demonstrated by means of some simulation experiments using artificial data sets. It is shown that these techniques are able to deal with different kinds of emergent phenomena such as transitions from chaos to order, concept drift, or novelty. That is, with these techniques it is possible to cover a wide range of possible applications.	chaos theory;concept drift;emergence;experiment;information theory;irreducibility;iteration;organic computing;simulation;traceability	Dominik Fisch;Martin Jänicke;Christian Müller-Schloer;Bernhard Sick	2011		10.1007/978-3-0348-0130-0_3	machine learning;organic computing;novelty;hellinger distance;concept drift;divergence;probabilistic logic;mathematics;data set;artificial intelligence	AI	-18.040704973332126	-17.67589087162331	160020
edba1238289a6fa2f51e89d5c6ba3de25f8f0a62	a new distance function for consensus determination in decision support systems		Consensus methods are used mainly to solve conflicts of knowledge in decision support systems. Generally speaking, conflicts of knowledge arise from the fact that system nodes (for example, agents, experts) may present various decisions or solutions to the user. This may be due to the use of various methods of decision support or different information sources by agents/experts. If there is a conflict of knowledge in the system and they are not automatically resolving the system cannot generate the final decision, and hence - the decision maker will not receive hints from the system. The use of consensus methods eliminates this problem, because they enable to solve conflicts of knowledge in near real time. At the same time they guarantee the achievement of a good compromise. However, the effective determination of consensus depends, among other, on the correct definition of the distance function.	decision support system	Marcin Hernes;Jadwiga Sobieska-Karpinska;Adrianna Kozierkiewicz-Hetmanska;Marcin Pietranik	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-98446-9_15	metric (mathematics);data mining;decision support system;computer science;compromise	Mobile	-6.429181186273902	-21.682090619935792	160383
3b3972cdb3e7f4ddbb7ca3184a665bd511ddbf6d	emergence of frontiers in networked schelling segregationist models		The relation between individuality and aggregation is an important topic in complex systems sciences, both aspects being facets of emergence. This topic has frequently been addressed by adopting a classical, individual versus population level perspective. Here, however, the frontiers that emerge in segregated communities are the focus; segregation is synonymous with the existence of frontiers that delineate and interface aggregates. A generic agent-based model is defined, with which we simulate communities located on grid and scale-free networked environments. Emerging frontiers are analyzed in terms of their relative occupancy, porosity, and permeability. Results emphasize that the frontier is highly sensitive to the topology of the environment, not only to the agent tolerance. These relations are clarified while addressing the topics of frontier robustness and the trade-off between its capacity to separate and allow exchange.	emergence	Philippe Collard;Salma Mesmoudi;Teodor Ghetiu;Fiona A.

351050ce43c5dbddc985300e06a48e3ab864e72f	a systems model for probabilistic risk assessment of improvised explosive device attacks	ied;improvised explosive device;human performance assessment;probabilistic risk assessment;terrorism	Due to their improvised nature, the variability in the design, manufacture and operation of most improvised explosive devices (IEDs) defy the traditional paradigms used to assess the effectiveness of conventional munitions. Thus, IEDs are complex socio-technical systems to model. To compensate for inadequacies in model design or data deficiencies, expert judgement and subjective probability assignments are often employed. The paper aims to reduce this reliance by developing an IED probabilistic risk assessment model using a systems model for IED attacks based on IED device reliability and characterising the human aspects of IED attack operational effectiveness from existing terrorism databases. This model can then be used to develop an automated model for IED probabilistic risk assessment that can be used towards informing military applications such as operations planning and war-gaming, and civil applications such as security risk management (including event planning), protective construction requirements, and insurance assessments. It was found that the risk of loss (fatalities, property damage) is influenced more by operational aspects (such as target selection, IED placement and attack timing) than the technical aspects of the device design and manufacture.

Selecting an inappropriate simulation software package could lead to incorrect results and costly and adversely effects on organisational performance. The success of simulation depends on the ability to select a suitable simulation software package for an intended application. This study presents an integrated approach for evaluation and selection of best simulation software packages. Due to the strategic nature of this issue, the proposed approach includes: 1) criteria extracted from the literature on evaluating simulation software packages; 2) a framework based on fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (fuzzy AHP) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (fuzzy TOPSIS), for selecting simulation software package; 3) an empirical study with data gathered from experts’ judgment to show applicability and superiority of the proposed model. In addition, the results are validated through sensitivity analysis.	analytical hierarchy;simulation software	Jochen Gläser	2001	IJTM	10.1504/IJTM.2001.002987	public relations;economics;knowledge management;marketing;management;law	SE	-6.922078305315091	-15.877412666832825	160620
54389c3b139b2c669a16e675e20c1b4987d26677	building size modelization		ABSTRACT New challenges in the efficient management of cities depend on a deep knowledge of their inner structures. It is therefore very important to have access to reliable models of cities characteristics and organization. This paper aims at providing and validating a stochastic modelization based on statistical data of buildings parameters which can be useful as an entry for many other models considered in a wide range of fields where buildings structure is a main factor of a thorough modelization of cities. The interest of such an approach is highlighted through the detection of errors in the data or as a tool for visual clustering.	cluster analysis;mathematical model;stochastic optimization	Arlette Antoni;Thierry Dhorne	2016	PeerJ PrePrints	10.7287/peerj.preprints.2264v2	management science;ecology;cluster analysis;biology	ML	-13.663888516572175	-23.51259927826881	160635
cba1bb2b19d87ceed17d3b62e0c646f8c7260bb8	impact of individual difference and investment heterogeneity on the collective cooperation in the spatial public goods game		Abstract In order to deeply elucidate the evolution of cooperation, we present a novel spatial public goods game (PGG) model in which the individual difference and investment heterogeneity is simultaneously taken into account. We characterize the individual difference by classifying all players into two categories: A − t y p e and B − t y p e , where A − t y p e cooperators will not give perfect contribution into a PGG group and their ratio will be controlled by the parameter e, while B − t y p e ones will always keep the unit investment into the group that they participate in. Meanwhile, the heterogeneity can be implemented by a non-uniform investment mechanism regarding A − t y p e cooperators, where a contribution from a cooperative agent into a PGG group is represented as a power function of fraction of cooperators inside this group. Extensive simulations indicate that the cooperation can be driven into a very high level by integrating these two components into the PGG model. Furthermore, the full cooperation phase diagrams further highlight their role in the promotion of cooperation. Current results will greatly enrich our understanding of collective cooperation behavior within many natural, social and even man-made systems.

Hybrid models which combine ABM with discrete-event simulation (DES) are particularly appealing in service industry applications. However in this paper we argue that many of the so-called distinctions between agents in an ABM and entities in a DES are artificial, and we describe several DES models which use standard entities to represent agent-like behaviors.	agent-based model;entity;simulation	Sally C.

The conflict has arisen primarily from unclear legal governance over the sea. To date, five major division methods have been proposed in Caspian Sea negotiations among the littoral states. Nevertheless, parties have not been able to agree over any of the suggested method for governing the sea and sharing its valuable natural and energy resources. In this paper, the Caspian Sea group decision-making problem is modeled and analyzed as a game using a non-cooperative game theoretic approach. The findings match with the current state of the conflict, suggesting that the current deadlock is a strong equilibrium and may last long if there are no major changes to the game structure and parties' behavior.	caspian;dead sea scrolls;deadlock;game theory	Iman Behmanesh;Kaveh Madani;Christopher D.

629ead6f974efbeb1670e35fb0e275e158290fd5	adaptive learning model for predicting negotiation behaviors through hybrid k-means clustering, linear vector quantization and 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic model	system of systems;behavior;clustering;negotiation;k means;network	Abstract   Acknowledged System of systems (SoS) manager has no direct control over contributing systems yet they deliver capabilities required to meet the purpose of the SoS operating in an interdependent environment. Forming a joint capability by contribution requires both persuasion and negotiation between the SoS coordinator and each individual system. Negotiation here involves multiple parties, and multiple issues. The challenges here include predicting an opponent system's negotiation behavior and reaching a near optimal negotiation outcome based on the following three issues: performance demands made by the coordinator, monetary benefits in lieu of effort required, and the deadline assigned to prepare for the final SoS participation formation. The negotiation framework proposed involves an unsupervised clustering of the difference between offers from both parties on all three issues by clustering techniques. The clustering results so far indicate the presence of four prominent behaviors: selfish, semi-cooperative, opportunistic, and extremely selfish. The clustered data was used to train both a radial bass function network (RBFN) and a linear vector quantization network (LVQN) to predict future offers. Once trained, the SoS manager uses 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model for decision making. A time-dependent strategy is used to generate a new offer by SoS manager to the systems.	k-means clustering;vector quantization	Siddhartha Agarwal;Hamid R. Saferpour;Cihan H.

The indicator is constructed using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which measures the economic efficiency of a decision-making process, or how efficiently a GDSS user converts decision resources into decision outcomes. To illustrate how our framework can be applied, we conduct an experiment that manipulates three contextual factors: communication mode, incentive structure, and group leadership. Within these contexts, we obtain an individual DEA decision efficiency score during the GDSS decision process, where participants are engaged in a mixed-motive task. We find that the communication mode, incentive structure, and interaction between the two significantly influence decision efficiency within this GDSS setting. However, the leadership structure does not have a significant impact on decision efficiency. The current study presents the first application of DEA in the area of GDSS. We illustrate how DEA is useful for evaluating GDSS-supported decision efficiency. The results suggest implications that guide the design of the next generation GDSS to support individuals within collaborative work groups involved in mixed-motive tasks.	data envelopment analysis	Reza Barkhi;Yi-Ching Kao	2010	Decision Support Systems	10.1016/j.dss.2010.02.002	r-cast;optimal decision;decision support system;decision analysis;decision engineering;knowledge management;operations management;decision analysis cycle;decision tree;data envelopment analysis;management science;evidential reasoning approach;business decision mapping	Metrics	-6.277069888378481	-16.930645227150546	161516

A series of ArcInfo Arc Macro Language scripts was subsequently created that enabled the production of either USLEor RUSLE-based LS factor raster grids using a digital elevation model input data set. These scripts have functioned exceptionally well for both singleand multiple-watershed applications within targeted study areas. However, due to the nature and complexity of flowpath processing necessary to compute cumulative slope length, the scripts have not taken advantage of available computing resources to the extent possible. It was determined that the speed of the computer runs could be significantly increased without sacrificing accuracy in the final results by performing the majority of the elevation data processing in a two-dimensional array framework outside the ArcInfo environment. This paper describes the evolution of a major portion of the original RUSLE-based AML processing code to an array-based executable program using ANSI C++ software. Examples of the relevant command-line arguments are provided and comparative results from several AML-vs.-executable time trials are also presented. In wide-ranging areas of the United States where it has been tested, the new RUSLE-based executable has produced LS-factor values that mimic those generated by the original AML as well as the RUSLE Handbook estimates. Anticipated uses of the executable program include water quality assessment, landscape ecology, land-use change detection studies, and decision support activities. This research has now given users the option of either running the executable file alone to process a single watershed reporting unit or running a supporting AML shell program that calls upon the executable file as necessary to perform automated processing for a user-specified number of watersheds. r 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

e605da1a3ba7e33e80c1d0ef44e0d48610624932	limited rationality and the strategic environment: further theory and experimental evidence		The psychology and behavioral economics literatures show that real world decision making at the individual level is frequently inconsistent with the rational actor model. An important question is therefore the extent to which a proportion of agents who make mistakes affects market level outcomes. Previous theoretical and experimental research showed that market level outcomes are less likely to match the rational actor model in settings characterized by strategic complementarity and more likely in settings characterized by strategic substitutability. We extend this research both theoretically and experimentally by introducing important real world complications – specifically, periodic shocks to the payoff structure and a periodic inflow of inexperienced players. We find that these complications can significantly slow convergence to rational actor equilibrium play, possibly even indefinitely.	actor model;complementarity theory;experience;experiment;rationality	Kristen B.

The excessive complexity of systems nowadays introduces more uncertainties for the arguments reviewing. This paper proposes a framework to support the argumentation assessment based on experts’ decision and confidence in the decision for the lowest level claims of the arguments. Expert opinion is extracted and converted in a quantitative model based on Dempster-Shafer theory. Several types of argument and associated formulas are proposed. A preliminary validation of this framework is realized through a survey for safety experts.	argumentation framework;consistency model;dependability;safety engineering;theory;trust (emotion)	Rui Wang;Jérémie Guiochet;Gilles Motet	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-66266-4_4	computer science;argumentation theory;reliability engineering;systems engineering;management science;life-critical system	AI	-9.363848043091105	-17.417478126536846	162389

The TACOM measure consists of five sub-measures that can cover remarkable complexity factors: (1) amount of information to be managed by operators, (2) logical entanglement due to the logical sequence of the required actions, (3) amount of actions to be accomplished by operators, (4) amount of system knowledge in recognizing the problem space, and (5) amount of cognitive resources in establishing an appropriate decision criterion. The appropriateness of the TACOM measure is investigated by comparing task performance time data with the associated TACOM scores. As a result, it is observed that there is a significant correlation between TACOM scores and task performance time data. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the TACOM measure can be used as a meaningful tool to quantify the complexity of tasks. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

On the other hands, a lot of troubles on trading also increase. This paper proposes a new evaluation mechanism to decrease the information incompleteness and asymmetry by using multi-attribute evaluation. Buyers can evaluate due to the multiple criteria chosen by sellers. Based on the number of criteria, the system determines the incentive rate of synthetic rating for sellers. Thus, they have an incentive to disclose evaluated items for buyers. Further, buyers can know a lot of information without information darkness. Sellers have an incentive to disclose a lot of attributes according to our experiment. Advantages of our proposed model include incomplete and asymmetric information decreases on the e-commerce site.	algorithm;e-commerce;internet;reasoning system;synthetic intelligence	Koki Murakata;Tokuro Matsuo	2010	2010 Eighth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering Research, Management and Applications	10.1109/SERA.2010.18	e-commerce;information asymmetry;the internet;concrete;computer science;system;complete information;forward auction	SE	-5.761823402228749	-12.96409221308696	162801

This necessitates a best value approach in selecting the right private partner (i.e., the concessionaire) that involves evaluating alternative concessionaires against multiple conflicting criteria of varying degrees of importance and uncertainty. Correspondingly, this paper has developed a quantitative best value concessionaire selection system. The essence of this system lies in (1) the establishment of four-package evaluation criteria that can effectively measure the concessionaire’s capability and ‘‘predict” its future performance toward achieving the government’s best value objectives and (2) the development of a fuzzy-composite scoring and ranking method that ensures the right ‘‘tradeoff” between these criteria by relatively weighting fuzzy scores and logically aggregating evaluation results. This system would not only provide the government integrated assessments of alternative concessionaires so as to award the contract to the right concessionaire whose proposal is perceived to be able to maximize the outcome of the project, but also satisfy the requirements of the legal decision in order to withstand legal challenges concerning the public contract awarded in a best value approach. A hypothetical case study is provided to demonstrate the application of this best value concessionaire selection system. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

c356983b8940e8c8f2e7ee18d06e5bb34d924fc5	an investigation of the evolutionary origin of reciprocal communication using simulated autonomous agents	dk atira pure researchoutput researchoutputtypes contributiontojournal article;genetics;proof of concept;autonomous simulated agents;artificial neural networks;autonomous agent;communication protocol;artificial evolution;communication;social behaviour;simulation model;artificial neural network	How does communication originates in a population of originally non-communicating individuals? Providing an answer to this question from a neo-Darwinian epistemological perspective is not a trivial task. The reason is that, for non-communicating agents, the capabilities of emitting signals and responding to them are both adaptively neutral traits if they are not simultaneously present. Research studies based on rather general and theoretically oriented evolutionary simulation models have, so far, demonstrated that at least two different processes can account for the origin of communication. On the one hand, communicative behaviour may first evolve in a non-communicative context and only subsequently acquire its adaptive function. On the other hand, communication may originate thanks to cognitive constraints; that is, communication may originate thanks to the existence of neural substrates that are common to the signalling and categorising capabilities. This article provides a proof-of-concept demonstration of the origin of communication in a novel-simulated scenario in which groups of two homogeneous (i.e. genetically identical) agents exploit reciprocal communication to develop common perceptual categories and to perform a collective task. In particular, in circumstances in which communication is evolutionarily advantageous, simulated agents evolve from scratch social behaviour through acoustic interactions. We look into the phylogeny of successful communication protocol, and we describe the evolutionary phenomena that, in early evolutionary stages, paved the way for the subsequent development of reciprocal communication, categorisation capabilities and successful cooperative strategies.	acoustic cryptanalysis;autonomous robot;categories;categorization;communications protocol;eaf2 gene;evolutionary algorithm;interaction;phylogenetics;simulation;biological signaling	Elio Tuci	2009	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s00422-009-0329-2	psychology;communications protocol;social behavior;computer science;artificial intelligence;autonomous agent;machine learning;simulation modeling;communication;social psychology;proof of concept;artificial neural network	AI	-15.934852250066264	-13.909284987784476	163318

The methodology consists of five tasks: (I) understand the plant through measurements, (II) create a process model, (III) adapt the model for optimization, (IV) optimize the process model, and (V) interpret the outcome of the task. A novelty of this methodology is the use of path-flow decomposition as a tool to provide a visual representation of the process, thus facilitating its understanding and the creation of the process model. Furthermore, a ath-flow decomposition rocess simulation INLP hermally unstable drug terilization decision-tree diagram furnishes detailed and specific support during the creation of the process model, in particular for a dissolution–filtration–crystallization process. Identification of constraints and optimization variables ensure the applicability of the methodology to pharmaceutics. Incorporation of measured process data improves the reliability of the methodology, making it applicable in real case studies.

Information technology projects are particularly prone to failure due to their specific characteristics, making risk management become one of the critical elements in IT projects management. That is why several authors have developed risk evaluation methods, some of them based on fuzzy logic. This article proposes a new risk assessment method based in a combination of fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy inference system (FIS). FIS is used for the integration of the groups of risk factors. These risk factors are the evaluation criteria of a modified FAHP which minimizes the disadvantages of the classic implementation of FAHP in order to obtain a more intuitive and easily adjustable model for multicriteria decision analysis with a lower computational need. The proposed model takes into consideration the different levels of uncertainty, the interrelationship among groups of risk factors, and the possibility of adding or suppressing options without losing the consistency with previous evaluations. The new method is especially suitable for the evaluation of development projects in the area of IT in which multiple interrelated risk factors can be particularly uncertain and imprecise. To implement the evaluation method, a hierarchy of risk factors was implemented. A numerical example is presented with data from three actual cases of IT projects, showing the applicability of the new method, the suitability of the selected taxonomy, and the significance of a few risk factors. Several future lines of work are proposed.		Antonio Rodríguez;Francisco Ortega;Ramiro Concepción	2016	Expert Syst.

Important components of such plans are forecasts of morbidity and mortality based on local social and geographic conditions. Most methodologies for simulations of epidemic outbreaks are implicitly based on the assumption that the frequency and duration of social contacts that lead to disease transmission is affected by geography, i.e. the spatial distribution of physical meeting places. In order to increase the effectiveness of the present methods for simulation of infectious disease outbreaks, the aim of this study is to examine two social geographic issues related to such models. We display how the social geographic characteristics of mixing networks, in particular when these significantly deviate from the random-mixing norm, can be represented in order to enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns in light of a possible future destructive influenza pandemic. We conclude that social geography, social networks and simulation models of directly transmitted infectious diseases are fundamentally linked.

82dbe672954ab01a83b1b2685f8f0c72b6849f15	modeling epidemics on d-cliqued graphs		Since social interactions have been shown to lead to symmetric clusters, we propose here that symmetries play a key role in epidemic modeling. Mathematical models on d-ary tree graphs were recently shown to be particularly effective for modeling epidemics in simple networks [Seibold & Callender, 2016]. To account for symmetric relations, we generalize this to a new type of networks modeled on d-cliqued tree graphs, which are obtained by adding edges to regular d-trees to form d-cliques. This setting gives a more realistic model for epidemic outbreaks originating, for example, within a family or classroom and which could reach a population by transmission via children in schools. Specifically, we quantify how an infection starting in a clique (e.g. family) can reach other cliques through the body of the graph (e.g. public places).	interaction;mathematical model	Laura P.

When contacting infected individuals in their own and neighboring groups, individuals may either be infected by one of the two viruses with a virus-dependent infection rate or become alert. Alert individuals may be infected by either virus but with a smaller virus-dependent infection rate, and the alert state also diffuses over the network. Limiting behaviors of the model are studied by analyzing the equilibria of the system and their stability. Both equilibria and their stability are compared with those of the model without human awareness.	simulation	Ji Liu;Philip E. Pare;Angelia Nedic;Carolyn L.

Examples include search and rescue, control of a complex system such as a factory, or robot soccer. Such tasks involve many agents, and huge numbers of states and possible actions. Factored Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a formal foundation for modeling such complex systems naturally and compactly. We propose a framework for multi-agent coordination and planning in factored MDPs based on the use of a factored value function — an approximate decomposition of the team value function as a sum of value functions of small subteams of agents. We show that factored value functions naturally give rise to an optimal distributed algorithm for joint action selection, whose communication structure naturally mirrors the interactions between the subteams. We present an efficient linear-programming-based algorithm for computing a factored value function for a factored MDP. We show how the use of factored value functions can form the basis for interdomain plan generalization, where we “learn” from plans constructed for some set of problems, and can provide good solutions to other unseen problems of the same type without any need for planning. We describe the application of this approach to the task of multi-agent planning in a strategic computer war game, and the application by Kok et al. for multi-agent coordination in their world-champion RoboSoccer team.

7a40468cec0a6487bc429f1cf98375abee0ff941	a statistical mechanics approach to immigrant integration in emilia romagna (italy)		Integration phenomena are social processes among human beings that take place every day when an autochthone population is experiencing the arrival of new immigrants. Although being a rising phenomenon (involving now over one billion people according to United Nations) which questions societies and policy-makers all over the world, numerical measurements capable to give robust insights over the way immigrant integration occurs are still far from what is usually considered an affordable standard in mathematical and physical sciences. Basing our analysis on previous seminal works, we follow here a statistical physics approach to the analysis of immigrant integration. In specific, we consider a large dataset collected by the Emilia Romagna region office of statistics (Italy), containing information over all marriages occurred amid the regional population during a sixteen years span, from 1995 to 2010. We define as quantifier of integration the percentage of marriages with spouses of mixed origin and we perform several analyses over the dataset, including binning and data fitting. The final outcome consists in an emerging pattern: quantifier’s average measurements align around a square root fit when considered with respect to a suitable function of the immigrant density. The theoretical interpretation we offer is that such result agrees with a suitable version of the Curie-Weiss model used in statistical mechanics to describe ferromagnetisms. More explicitly, immigrants living in Emilia Romagna municipalities seem to present mainly imitative behavior’s phenomena in making social actions for integration. The result emerged with Emilia Romagna data complies with previous works concerning similar data coming from Spain.

8d4c18d3f51fc6cc623da285a53fbd322dd18ea7	a novel framework to evaluate programmable logic controllers: a fuzzy mcdm perspective	fuzzy delphi;fuzzy ahp;plc evaluation;fuzzy dematel;mcdm	A programmable logic controller (PLC) is a real-time system operated in severe conditions such as high/low temperatures or tough environments with excessive electrical noise. In particular, a PLC is designed to connect and control multiple mechatronic devices such as facility sensors and actuators and thus the issue of selecting/assessing PLC suppliers is critically important to achieve automatic process control and facility monitoring. In reality, various MCDM (multi-criteria decision making) composed of MADM (multi-attribute) and MODM (multi-objective) based schemes are frequently adopted to tackle the problem of supplier selection. Nevertheless, most of them have the following demerits: (1) the causal dependences between main criteria (or associate attributes) are rarely considered (2) a large number of pairwise comparisons are usually required to conduct the evaluation process. Consequently, a novel framework combining fuzzy DEMATEL, fuzzy AHP, with fuzzy Delphi is proposed to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings. Without requiring tedious pairwise comparisons, the importance weights of main criteria (associated attributes) and the performance scores of PLC vendors are systematically fused into the whole evaluation process. Furthermore, an industrial example is demonstrated to assist PLC practitioners in assessing the top three suppliers, such as SIEMENS (31 %), Allen-Bradley (22 %) and Mitsubishi (13 %).	as-interface;causal filter;causality;computational complexity theory;importance sampling;interdependence;mechatronics;noise (electronics);norm (social);performance;power-line communication;programmable logic device;real-time clock;real-time computing;sensor	Chih-Hsuan Wang;Huishan Wu	2016	J.

Network utility maximization and other methods can be used to achieve efficient designs when the communities are composed of compliant users. However, such methods are not effective and efficient when the communities are composed of intelligent and self-interested users (multimedia social communities, social networks etc.), because the interests of the individual users may be in conflict. In our prior work, we designed social reciprocation protocols by assuming a stationary community in which a continuum population interacts. We proved that given these assumptions, users have incentives to voluntarily operate according to pre-determined social norms and provide services. In this paper, we extend this study to analyze the interactions of self-interested users under a social norm in an online community of finite population and without making stationary assumptions about the community. To optimize their long-term performance while operating in the community, users adapt strategies to play their best response based on their knowledge by solving individual stochastic control problems. The best-response dynamic introduces a stochastic dynamic process in the community, in which the strategies of users evolve over time. Understanding how a community responds to incentives in the long-term provides protocol designers with guidelines for designing social norms in which no user will find it into its self-interest to adapt and deviate from the prescribed protocol. This will, in turn, influence the evolution of the community and induce the emergence of cooperative behavior among users, thereby maximizing the optimal social welfare of the community.	communications protocol;emergence;expectation–maximization algorithm;interaction;network utility;norm (social);online community;social network;spherical basis;stationary process;stochastic control;triune continuum paradigm	Yu Zhang;Mihaela van der Schaar	2011	2011 49th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/Allerton.2011.6120183	simulation;knowledge management;political science;social psychology	HCI	-13.728717849495613	-14.529941584194997	165830

Two giant commercial aircraft makers, Airbus and Boeing, complete for better deals by selecting components for their newly designed aircraft, incurring conflicts due to their rivalry and the clash of interests with suppliers. To control the costs of their next generation aircraft and shorten the production period, both manufacturers demand better deals from potential suppliers with lower prices and more output. A conflict arises among the manufacturers and potential suppliers in the negotiation of the contract in each supply chain. To investigate these conflicts comprehensively, a hierarchical approach is adopted by constructing a Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) with a hierarchical structure. The stakeholders may obtain strategic resolutions according to possible outcomes indicated by stability results. These findings in the hierarchical graph model are further compared to those obtained when each conflict is investigated separately.	avionics;connected component (graph theory);graph theory;next-generation network;sl (complexity);shingled magnetic recording;supply chain attack	Shawei He;Keith W.

96f8ff3c41555b7043f689371ac181fc0bafc994	research on discussion of gender difference in preference for smart watches based on fuzzy analytic hierarchy process		As wearable devices have been intelligentized in recent years, many high-teach companies launch smart watches successively. These companies constantly upgrade shapes and functions of smart watches. However, market performances of some products are not up to the expected standard, since smart watches are in the leading-in period of product life cycle and the market demand remains unclear. Furthermore, because different consumer groups have different consumer psychologies and behaviors, they show various preferences for functions of smart watches. For instance, male group tends to be more rational and regular in consumer behaviors, while female group is more sensitive with active thinking and strong initiative in consumer behaviors. Moreover, female group prefers to pursue fashion and novelty, purchase some new products and try new life. As a result, how to locate developments of smart watches in light of needs of different users is an important research topic. According to the questionnaire data, this research adopts Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to explore the differences of consumer psychologies and behaviors of customers in product preferences, concluding the determinant attributes for attracting consumers to buy products. Compared with traditional Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), FAHP combines AHP and fuzzy theory. Ambiguous problem assessments must use the concept of fuzzy function in FAHP to calculate fuzzy weights. This research adopts questionnaire survey to handle research questions in hierarchical analyses. Similarity aggregation method is utilized to integrate opinions of research objects. Then, FAHP is used to figure out importance degrees of all hierarchies, analyzing the differences of the two groups in preferences for functions of smart watches. First of all, this research collects opinions of experts and experienced product designers through surveying users of smart watches. In addition, various kinds of evaluation criteria are selected. The representative five criteria and thirteen sub-criteria are arranged through classification. The five criteria are battery time, interaction, communication, security and APP development. The thirteen sub-criteria are voice, touch, physical, auxiliary communication, independent communication, waterproof, theftproof, time management, geographic information, intelligent life, sports health, sociality and battery time. After confirming the hierarchical structure established by five criteria and thirteen sub-criteria, this research adopts paired comparison method to design the questionnaire. Moreover, this research sets up paired matrix table of questionnaire data in accordance with the defined evaluation values of fuzzy linguistic. Besides, this research integrates opinions of research objects through similarity aggregation method, calculating fuzzy weights for obtaining eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Eventually, this research conducts criteria ranking of all data from assessment criteria and sub-criteria. That is how to infer the differences of different gender consumers in preferences for functions of smart watches. According to the methods and results of this research which can be aimed at different target populations, development strategies of smart watches are proposed respectively and recommendation of product function combination is presented in light of different target markets.

c361444546ad9b6e928d9adefa77d61773055d4d	language change in a multiple group society		The processes leading to change in languages are manifold. In order to reduce ambiguity in the transmission of information, agreement on a set of conventions for recurring problems is favored. In addition to that, speakers tend to use particular linguistic variants associated with the social groups they identify with. The influence of other groups propagating across the speech community as new variant forms sustains the competition between linguistic variants. With the utterance selection model, an evolutionary description of language change, Baxter et al. [Phys. Rev. E 73, 046118 (2006)] have provided a mathematical formulation of the interactions inside a group of speakers, exploring the mechanisms that lead to or inhibit the fixation of linguistic variants. In this paper, we take the utterance selection model one step further by describing a speech community consisting of multiple interacting groups. Tuning the interaction strength between groups allows us to gain deeper understanding about the way in which linguistic variants propagate and how their distribution depends on the group partitioning. Both for the group size and the number of groups we find scaling behaviors with two asymptotic regimes. If groups are strongly connected, the dynamics is that of the standard utterance selection model, whereas if their coupling is weak, the magnitude of the latter along with the system size governs the way consensus is reached. Furthermore, we find that a high influence of the interlocutor on a speaker's utterances can act as a counterweight to group segregation.	baxter (robot);behavior;conferences;image scaling;interaction;languages;linguistics;mathematics;speaker device component;strongly connected component;test scaling;manifold	Cristina-Maria Pop;Erwin Frey	2013	Physical review.

In decision making problems a DM is almost never provided with perfect, that is ideal decision relevant information to determine states of nature, outcomes, probabilities, etc. We are known that, relevant information almost always comes imperfect. Imperfect information is information which in one or more respects is imprecise, uncertain, incomplete, unreliable, vague or partially true [1]. Imprecision is one of the widest concepts including variety of cases. We will discuss uncertainty concepts of imperfect information and it application to problem modeling of decision maker. In the first stage of the modeling the identification determinants of a decision maker was implemented using Delphi method. The aim of the second stage consists of the linguistic evaluation of the factors. At the final stages decision makers model was realised by using possibilityprobability based method and Dempster-Shafer theory based model.	algebraic modeling language;delphi method;embarcadero delphi;expert system;inference engine;matlab;real life;vagueness	Latafat A.

One of the drawbacks in most organizations and cooperative teams regarding manager selection is lack of a proper model in ranking the candidate qualification. In this study, a novel fuzzy approach is applied to select competent project manager. In this model the human personality traits, emotional and cognitive features are considered as fuzzy parameters and are applied in selecting the best manager. The Repast software, a multi-agent simulator, is applied in this model. The findings indicate that managers selected with this approach are considered qualified by the given organization.	fuzzy logic;simulation	Paria Shams Ghahfarokhi;Naser Ghasem-Aghaee;Ehsan Taheri	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-66824-6_11	fuzzy logic;management science;project management;project manager;software;big five personality traits;business;knowledge management;multi-agent system;ranking;cognition	AI	-6.957914503820472	-16.232372617967354	167659
775b5729063aaf601ac9897a119bc5abf76be6f7	a study of dynamic coordination mechanisms	coordination mechanisms	Coordination, or the act of managing interdependencies between activities, is a key issue within the field of multi-agent systems. Because of the importance of this issue, many theoretical and practical frameworks have been proposed for addressing coordination challenges. However, finding the optimal coordination method for a given group of agents and domain task is a computationally difficult, if not intractable, problem in most real-world domains. Solving the “coordination problem” is thus an important open challenge for researchers in this field. Towards addressing this issue, this thesis presents an algorithm selection approach for creating adaptive coordination methods. We study several types of coordination problems from robotic foraging and search domains, constraint satisfaction and optimization domains, and Peer to Peer networks. We find that novel teamwork measures can be developed for quantifying the effectiveness of coordination algorithms in all of these domains. These measures can be autonomously and locally measured by team members, even without any communication. The significance of this result is its ability to effectively quantify coordination in a clear, tractable fashion. Next, we find that these measures can be used to switch between coordination methods as needed. Robots or agents can effectively select the best coordination method to their localized domain conditions, online during task execution. The net result is a significant productivity improvement of these adaptive methods over the static methods they are based on.	algorithm selection;autonomous robot;cobham's thesis;constraint satisfaction;interdependence;mathematical optimization;method (computer programming);multi-agent system	Avi Rosenfeld	2009	Knowledge Eng.

895c640fab645c24cafd84f9b7b8784193351b55	integrating kpso and c5.0 to analyze the omnichannel solutions for optimizing telecommunication retail		Abstract Telecommunication system providers offer many special number commodities, and all marketing staff sell the commodities and special number combinations according to their marketing experience; consequently, telecommunication retailers find it difficult to consider both user demands and profits in their marketing strategies. This study proposes a classification model integrating K-means Particle Swarm Optimization (KPSO) and C5.0. The particlesu0027 PSO only followed pbest and gbest when moving, resulting in the disadvantage that PSO may easily fall into a local optimal solution. First, clustering analysis is carried out using the KPSO clustering method. Second, classification rules for clustering results are formulated by the C5.0 classification method, and a classification model is established in order to achieve effective descriptions of the clustering rules. The methods proposed herein can help retailers find and utilize complementary tariff products for mobile numbers as the basis for future sales and procurement. This study also analyzes the best media for customersu0027 mobile phone purchase methods and utilizes different groups of buyers of the omnichannel. The proposed model is also able to categorize new future tariffs and can further conceptualize the clustering results in the analysis of telecom tariffs and product mix. Finally, the results effectively assist the telecommunications retail industry when considering procurement, product projects, sales, and marketing solutions.	c4.5 algorithm;omnichannel	Shen-Tsu Wang	2018	Decision Support Systems	10.1016/j.dss.2017.12.009	computer science;omnichannel;procurement;mobile phone;categorization;cluster analysis;profit (economics);telecommunications;particle swarm optimization;tariff	Metrics	-5.2397484842131785	-14.707915299772331	168191

Laboratory (lab) testing is a critical step in developing vehicle components or systems. It allows the design engineer to evaluate the design early in the product development process. Establishing a good lab-test minimum-life requirement (bogey) is an important task for the engineer in order to provide a reliable product. When applying the techniques in this paper to the automotive industry, the test procedures can be generalized to any situation for which the Weibull distribution (with known shape parameter) appropriately describes failure behavior, and for which accelerated lab-tests are being correlated with field-test data. This paper covers approaches for determining reliability-test target development, lab-test bogey conversion, and the quantity of test samples (and the test length) which must be tested to meet the reliability demonstration target requirement.	new product development;norm (social);test data	Ming-Wei Lu;Richard J.

Yet many popularly used social models neglect to model normative effects on human behavior, relying on simple probabilistic and majority voting models of influence diffusion. Within the multi-agent research community, the study of norm emergence, compliance, and adoption has resulted in new architectures and standards for normative agents; however few of these models have been successfully applied to real-world public policy problems. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight architecture for constructing normative agents to model human social systems; the aim of our research is to be able to study the effects of different public policy decisions on a community. Here we present a case study showing the usage of our architecture for predicting trends in smoking cessation resulting from a smoke-free campus initiative. Our agent-based model combines social, environmental, and personal factors to accurately predict smoking trends and attitudes.

Considering infectious disease outbreaks, time becomes a critical factor and Public Health officers require tools to support rapid decision making. In this context, GIS technology presents some limits. Mainly, the study of communicable diseases requires the development of complicated spatial-temporal models which is often time and effort consuming. In addition, this type of dynamic analysis is hard to realize by means of the GIS functionalities commonly available. Addressing such limits, we present in this paper a new GIS-based spatial-temporal simulation approach and software to support public health decision making in the context of communicable diseases. Our approach stands out by the integrative perspective and the explicit spatial aspect that it offers. On the one hand, it fully integrates epidemiological, mobility and GIS-data models at an aggregate population level in order to support public health decision making. This is made possible because our approach is built on data automatically processed from transportation surveys that are widely available, at least in North America and Europe. Our approach is thus simple and can be promptly put into use. On the other hand, our approach particularly aims at supporting decision makers with respect to """"spatialized"""" intervention policies.

Besides, a new method of multiagent reinforcement learning is developed for this system, and it is applied to part placement in printed circuit board design problems of a CAD domain. In this field, many techniques of global optimization were proposed to reduce design cycle and production cost. Such techniques, however, could not offer more efficient part placement than human experts so that most important final decisions often had to be left to humans. On the other hand, with the system proposed in this study, part placement is not treated from a global viewpoint; instead, decisions about placement of individual parts are made by agents in charge through local interactions. Results of applying the proposed system to a full-scale real-life problem suggest the following. (1) Our system offered practicable solutions that were competitive with those by human experts. (2) Our system outperformed existing methods of reinforcement learning in terms of both convergence speed and total wiring length.© 1999 Scripta Technica, Syst Comp Jpn, 30(11): 33–42, 1999	printed circuit board;printing	Keiki Takadama;Shinichi Nakasuka;Takao Terano	1999	Systems and Computers in Japan	10.1002/(SICI)1520-684X(199910)30:11%3C33::AID-SCJ4%3E3.0.CO;2-B	organizational learning;self-organization;simulation;computer science;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning;learning classifier system;printed circuit board;emergence	HCI	-9.05822173521463	-10.930379842294093	169605

We address this issue of operational emergency response in natural disaster management (NDM) by suggesting a decision support model and a Monte Carlo heuristic which account for these challenges by drawing on fuzzy set theory and fuzzy optimization. Deriving requirements for addressing NDM situations from both practice and literature, we propose a decision model that accounts for the following phenomena: a) incidents and rescue units are spatially distributed, b) rescue units possess specific capabilities, c) processing is non-preemptive, and d) informational uncertainty occurs due to vague and linguistic specifications of data. We computationally evaluate our heuristic and benchmark the results with current best practice solutions. Our results indicate that applying the new heuristic can substantially reduce overall harm.	benchmark (computing);best practice;decision support system;emoticon;fuzzy set;heuristic;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;requirement;scheduling (computing);set theory;vagueness	Felix Wex;Guido Schryen;Dirk Neumann	2012	IJISCRAM	10.4018/jiscrm.2012070103	computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;data mining;operations research	SE	-6.437661244213573	-15.370304023201223	169913

Since purchasing a car is costly, the consumers in the market tend to behave like rational decision makers. They naturally compare the attributes of cars (e.g., brand preference, fuel economy, safety, comfort) and make overall decisions. In this paper, we propose an agent-based (AB) diffusion model consisting of tens of thousands of interacting agents. In the model, an agent represents a consumer and bases its multi-attribute decision-making on fuzzy TOPSIS. The decision-making process integrates three purchasing forces: expert’s product information provided by mass media, subjective weights on product attributes assigned by individual consumers, and social influence (i.e., information delivered from a consumer’s neighbors who have already adopted products). The AB model executes the agents and observes the collective behavior. In this sense, the model can assist in the analysis of the complex market dynamics. We conducted an empirical study to verify the performance of the AB model. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

e0d169b60488bbb98f2bf7ade4e58a8918d3c60c	the development of a support bar without structural modification of the domestic environment		A removable support bar without structural modification of the environment, was developed. Assistive technology (AT) is a multidisciplinary science that combines knowledge of health professionals and the exact sciences area. This study is based in the methods of engineering product design and its relation to the development of resources. This paper aims to present the development process of a removable support bar that is easy to use, requiring no technical knowledge and no change the constitution of the walls and floors in the houses. Based on the methodology design the study was divided into five stages: informational (questionnaire with closed questions and an essay from the target population for use of the bar); conceptual (technical specifications, design, standards, solutions and decisions); preliminary design (design and drawing fully bar, and prototype (project preparation and design of the bar, prototyping and evaluation), validation (validation of the prototype). As the results, the support bar have been developed with seven parts for assembly in several configurations that can attend the populations needs in terms of available room: the parts are: base, tube, tee, elbow, elbow 30o.; elbow 60o. and elbow-tee. Volunteer’s priority are to employ it in the bathrooms and bedrooms. The attachment configuration has small height (0,90 m) and is glued with thermo wax resin that is easy to assemble, and fixation, is removable causing no damage to the floor surface and is secure.

This paper explores using multiple reinforcement learning agents in a simple static environment to research methods allowing such agents to communicate during learning. The problem of developing a model whereby reinforcement learning agents can learn faster through the use of communication is explored. This paper develops two agents that are able to communicate with each other and able to learn about their actions using reinforcement learning techniques. The maze environment is used as a testbed. In this environment, the two agents are required to navigate the maze and trade information about the state of each other. This information includes the expected utilities for all actions from that state. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, the agents are implemented. In addition, the efficiency of this model is compared with single agents and two independent agents.	reinforcement learning	Elhadi M.

Consequently, policy can err. In this paper we show how the use of simulation models can reduce policy errors by inferring empirically reliable and meaningful statements about economic processes. We suggest that policy is best based on so-called abductive simulation models, which help to better understand how policy measures can influence economic processes. We show that abductive simulation models use a combination of theoretical and empirical analysis based on different data sets. By way of example we show what policy can learn with the help of abductive simulation models, namely how policy measures can influence the emergence of a regional cluster.

The mechanisms leading to community formation are strongly related with social pressure and the topology of the contact network. Here, we discuss an approach to model social behavior which accounts for the protection by alike peers proportional to their relative abundance in the closest neighborhood. We explore the ensuing non-linear dynamics emphasizing the role of the specific structure of the social network, modeled by scale-free graphs. We find that both coexistence of opinions and consensus on the default position are possible stationary states of the model. In particular, we show how these states critically depend on the heterogeneity of the social network and the specific distribution of external control elements.

Making such trade-offs during early stages of requirements and design is challenging because costs and benefits of alternatives are often hard to quantify. Objective: The objective of this work is to develop a decision analysis method that assists in making trade-offs in the absence of quantitative data. Method: In this method, stakeholders qualitatively compare consequences of alternatives on decision criteria. We propose an algorithm that generates all possible consequences of alternatives on requirements, according to the rough qualitative comparisons that stakeholders made. The possible consequences generated by the algorithm are then analyzed by the Even Swaps Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis method to determine the best solution. The Even Swaps method is a technique developed in management science to assist in multi-criteria decision making when explicit value trade-offs are not available. Results and conclusions: Our algorithm teases out the need to accurately measure or estimate costs and benefits of alternative design solutions. The algorithm automates the Even Swap process, and reuses stakeholders' value trade-offs throughout the Even Swaps process. We applied the prototype tool in several case studies to evaluate the utility of the method. The results of case studies provide evidence that our decision aid method selects the optimum solution correctly compared to results of other similar quantitative methods, while our method does not rely on detailed numerical assessment of alternatives and importance weights of criteria.	level of measurement;requirement	Golnaz Elahi;Eric Kai-Hsiang Yu	2012	Information & Software Technology	10.1016/j.infsof.2011.10.007	computer science;systems engineering;management science;multiple-criteria decision analysis	SE	-5.244398370718778	-18.69775564129397	170534

Due to rich information of plenty of competitive product alternatives, consumers face the challenges to compare and choose the most suitable products. Whilst a product comprises different tangible and intangible features, consumers tend to buy the features rather than a product itself. A successful product has most features meeting the consumer needs. Perception values of product features from consumers are complex to be measured and predicted. To reduce information overload for searching their preferred products, this paper proposes the Fuzzy Cognitive Pairwise Comparison for Ranking and Grading Clustering (FCPC-RGC) to build a recommender system. The fuzzy number enables rating flexibility for the users to handle rating uncertainty. The Fuzzy Cognitive Pairwise Comparison (FCPC) is used to evaluate consumer preferences for multiple features of a product by pairwise comparison ratings. The Fuzzy Grade Clustering (FGC) is used to group the product alternatives into different consumer preference grades. To verify the validity and applicability of FCPC-RGC, a smartphone recommender system using the proposal approach is demonstrated how the system is able to help the consumers to recommend the suitable products according to the customers’ individual preference.	cluster analysis;fuzzy number;fuzzy set;information overload;recommender system;smartphone;while	Kevin Kam Fung Yuen	2017	Eng.

The mathematical structure of the approach is based on the theory of quantum measurements, which makes this approach relevant both for the description of decision making of humans and the creation of artificial quantum intelligence. General rules are formulated allowing for the explicit calculation of quantum probabilities representing the fraction of decision makers preferring the considered prospects. This provides a method to quantitatively predict decision-maker choices, including the cases of games with high uncertainty for which the classical expected utility theory fails. The approach is applied to experimental results obtained on a set of lottery gambles with gains and losses. Our predictions, involving no fitting parameters, are in very good agreement with experimental data. The use of quantum decision making in game theory is described.

We show that the profiles of cue utilization according to whether the control task was extremely unstable or moderately unstable. The strategies employed to control the environment showed sensitivity to the dynamic properties of the environment. Under conditions in which the environment was most unstable people tended to vary all the cues in order to stabilize the outcome, whereas the strategy to vary one cue at a time was adopted under stable task conditions. These findings are discussed with respect to the Monitoring and Control (Osman, 2010a, 2010b) framework and its proposals for cue utilization and strategy application under conditions of uncertainty. Cue Utilization & Strategy Application Introduction We often find ourselves in complex situations in which we are required to take control and develop ways of solving problems in order to generate desirable outcomes. Of interest to research in problem solving and decision making are the types of learning mechanisms that enable us to extract relevant information in order to successfully control outcomes, in particular in dynamic uncertain environments (Cohen, Freeman, & Wolf, 1996; Klein, 1997; Lipshitz, Klein, Orasanu, & Salas, 2001; Lipshitz & Strauss, 1997), such as economic (e.g. stock exchange), industrial (e.g., chemical waste disposal), critical safety (e.g., automated-pilot systems) and biological (e.g., eco-systems). Given the properties of these environments, an action may not reliably produce the same outcome each time, which raises the question: What factors influence how we learn relations between actions and outcomes in an uncertain dynamic environment? The aim of this study is to address this question in detail by examining control-based behaviour using a simulated complex dynamic task environment. Uncertain dynamic environments Often when determining the outcome in complex uncertain environments a series of non-independent decisions are made (Brehmer, 1992). A future decision builds on the outcome of a previous decision and so on in order to work towards a goal. For instance, if we decide to take a couple of aspirin when we have a headache, we know that there is a variable delay in taking effect, and that the intensity of headaches changes over time. If after some period the headache persists, we may decide to take more aspirin, but without being sure that it will take effect, and if so, when it will do so. In this case, our decision making requires a series of choices to act towards achieving a specific goal (alleviating the headache), but there is uncertainty attached to our choice of actions (when to take aspirin, and at what dosage), because we cannot be sure we will reliably produce the desired effect. This could be because of: 1) the underlying probabilistic Cue Utilization & Strategy Application relationship between decision and outcomes, 2) the dynamic nature of the environment itself that is, changes in the outcome occur even when no action is taken 3) or both. So, given that in an uncertain environment we are often required to make decisions that are directed towards achieving a particular goal, what is the method by which we learn to do this? One approach to studying learning behavior in complex dynamic control (CDC) tasks involves the individual interacting with an environment by deciding from various cues (e.g., drug A, B, C) actions that are relevant (e.g., selecting drug A at dosage X) to changing the outcome (e.g., reduce the spread of disease). In CDC tasks, the cueoutcome associations are probabilistic, and the environment is often dynamic which ensures that from trial to trial the effects on the outcome will change. The effects of instruction during training on control performance The focus of many studies has been to examine the effects of varying the specificity of the goal under which the individual is instructed to learn about the environment (Burns & Vollmeyer, 2002; Geddes & Stevenson, 1997; Miller, Lehman & Koedinger, 1999; Osman, 2008a, 2008b; Vollmeyer, Burns & Holyoak, 1996). In this way, it is possible to examine the best conditions under which to learn to control an uncertain dynamic environment. The main contrast is between specific goal (SG) conditions, in which people learn to achieve and maintain a particular outcome (e.g., learn to reduce and contain the spread of Disease Y), and non specific goal (NSG) conditions, in which people learn about the environment in an unconstrained way (i.e. learn about the relationship between the different drugs and their effects on the spread of the disease). The early CDC studies involved SG learning (Berry & Broadbent, 1984, 1987, 1988; Broadbent, 1977; Broadbent & Ashton, 1978; Broadbent, Fitzgerald, & Broadbent, 1986). What they, and others since (Dienes & Fahey, 1995, 1998; Gonzalez, Lerch, & Cue Utilization & Strategy Application Lebiere, 2003) have shown, is that SG learning is a successful way of training individuals to select actions (i.e. change the correct cues and to appropriate values) that will reliably control an outcome to a criterion. However, later work contrasting this method with NSG learning, has shown it to be a poor basis for acquiring a deep understanding of the task environment. For instance, under NSG learning there is transfer of control skills to a range of unfamiliar goal criteria, which is not found under SG learning (Burns & Vollmeyer, 2002; Osman, 2008a, Vollmeyer, et al, 1996). In addition, compared to SG instructions, knowledge of the cue-outcome associations is more accurate under NSG training instructions (Burns & Vollmeyer, 2002; Geddes & Stevenson, 1997; Miller, et al., 1999; Osman, 2008a, 2008b; Vollmeyer, et al., 1996). The effects of length of training on control performance Another approach to examining behaviour in CDC tasks outside of varying the goal is to investigate the effects of length of training on control performance. Typically, CDC tasks involve short training sessions (between 12 and 40 trials; Berry & Broadbent, 1988; Burns & Vollmeyer, 2002; Lee, 1995; Sanderson, 1989; Stanley, Mathews, Buss, & Kotler-Cope, 1989). As a result, such short exposure to the CDC task environment means that it is unclear whether poor knowledge of the environment is a result of limited experience with it, or because of the complexity of the actual structure of the actual system people are required to control. To address this, Stanley et al., (1989) examined whether more exposure to the task environment can lead to further improvements in the controllability of the system. They found that, as compared with performance in typical short training schedules, there were increases in control performance, but that this did not in turn lead to additional improvement in knowledge of the system itself. That is, knowledge of the structural properties of the systems, i.e. the causal relations between cues and outcomes, was no better than levels of knowledge after short training procedures. Moreover, later studies suggest that extended practice alone does not, in Cue Utilization & Strategy Application turn, reliably lead to improved control performance (Gonzalez, 2005; Kanfer et al., 1994; Kerstholt, 1996; Kerstholt & Raaijmakers, 1997). However, these findings are at odds with evidence that, in real rather than simulated laboratory based CDC tasks, extended practice facilitates accurate reportable knowledge of the CDC task and improves control-based skill (e.g., Lipshitz et al., 2001). In addition, when combined with instructions that direct people to evaluate their behaviours and their knowledge during training, extensive training leads to improved and longer retention of the newly acquired skills (Linou & Kontogiannis, 2004), better resource allocation of executive processes, including attention and working memory (Brehmer & Allard, 1991, as well as encouraging people to set more appropriate goals while operating CDC task (Morin & Latham, 2000).). Clearly, understanding how length of training impacts on our learning, and the longer term effects it can have on our ability to generate desirable outcomes in uncertain dynamic environments is of importance. What factors influence how we learn relations between cue-outcomes in uncertain dynamic environments? Returning to the target question of this study, much of the work on controlbased behaviours in CDC tasks shows that the most successful methods of learning in a dynamic environment involve presenting people with NSGs which enable people to experience a wide range of states of the system. It may also be the case that the mixed findings concerning the impact of length of training on control performance are due to differences in the goals that people are required to adopt. In summarizing the evidence here, we propose that there are two critical factors that bear relevance on the issue of the success of learning in uncertain dynamic environments: (1) the way in which the outcome is evaluated (i.e. with respect to the goal), and (2) the quality of states of the system experienced (i.e. the range of cue-outcome associations). In addition, we propose a third factor that has not been explored in detail, namely the actual dynamic properties of the environment itself (Osman, 2010b). Therefore, we suggest that in addition to (1) and (2) Cue Utilization & Strategy Application the stability of the relationship between cue-outcome associations also influences the success of learning in uncertain dynamic environments. CDC tasks come in many varieties (for review see, Osman, 2010a), but crucially, they tend to fall into two categories: those that are dynamic, by which we refer to Funke’s (1993) definition “An endogenous variable [that] at time t ha		Magda Osman;Maarten Speekenbrink	2011	Cognitive Systems Research	10.1016/j.cogsys.2010.12.004	psychology;complex systems;simulation;hypothesis;uncertainty;dynamical system;dynamic decision-making;communication;social psychology	AI	-13.828835374695633	-12.006229337458638	171114

In the pay-per-impression based RTB advertising, frequency capping is undoubtedly one of the most crucial issues faced by advertisers and Demand Side Platforms (DSPs), since there are generally vast amount of ad requests in RTB markets, among which many may be triggered by the same target audience. As such, choosing the optimal frequency cap considering all the advertisers becomes a critical issue faced by DSPs. Considering that displaying one advertisement multiple number of times to the same user will diminish the advertising effect, we introduce the concept of discount factor and establish an optimization model of frequency capping to seek for the optimal frequency cap for each advertiser. We also design some experiments to validate our proposed model by utilizing the computational experiment approach, and the experimental results show that the optimal frequency cap can be influenced by the values of the discount factors, and higher value of the discount factor can deduce the advertising effect of larger frequency cap. Moreover, when the discount factors of the advertisers take different values, there also exists an optimal frequency cap, at which the advertisers can get the expected maximum revenue in the long run.	automated planning and scheduling;big data;computation;cost per impression;digital signal processor;emoticon;experiment;frequency capping;java caps;mathematical optimization;online advertising;optimization problem;real-time bidding	Rui Qin;Yong Yuan;Fei-Yue Wang	2016	2016 IEEE International Conferences on Big Data and Cloud Computing (BDCloud), Social Computing and Networking (SocialCom), Sustainable Computing and Communications (SustainCom) (BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom)	10.1109/BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom.2016.64	simulation;time–frequency analysis;big data;real-time bidding;computer science;digital signal processing;computational model	Metrics	-7.330170113844258	-9.908392718545533	171408

3a79c0e47a36f90e6fea143d80a27d622a038838	the lexicographic decision function	decision process	In this paper the lexicographic decision process is presented in a unified way. We construct a lexicographic decision function using a universal preference function and a unary function. This construction incorporates the different outranking approaches,the lexicographic decision process and the utility based decision making models. Finally we consider the connection of the lexicographic decision method and the Arrow paradox. 1.Introduction In this section we describe the concept of the lexicographic method. We use the terminology of P.C. Fishburn, see [6]. The general concept of a finite lexicographic order involves a set I = {1, 2, ..., n} and an order relation ≺i on a nonempty set Xi for each i ∈ I. We let ∼i denote the symmetric complement of ≺i so that xi ∼i yi if and only if (xi ≺i yi or yi ≺i xi) does not hold. With x = (x1, x2, ..., xn) and y = (y1, y2, ..., yn) , y precedes x lexicographically under the natural order < on I and with respect to the ≺i or x < L y for short, iff {i : i ∈ I and (xi ≺i yi or yi ≺i xi)} is nonempty, and xi ≺i yi for the first (smallest) i in this set. For this reason a lexicographic order <is also referred to as an order by first difference. An example of a lexicographic order arises from the alphabetical order of words in a dictionary or lexicon. To show this let I = {1, 2, ..., n} , let Xi = A = {∅, a, b, ..., z} with ∅ ≺i a ≺i b ≺i ... ≺i z for each i , take n as large as the longest listed word , and let the English word α1α2...αm with m ≤ n correspond to (α1, α2, ..., αm, ∅, ..., ∅) in A . Then <on the subset of A which corresponds to the ”legitimate ” words orders these words in their natural alphabetical order. For example, ”as” precedes ”ask” since (a, s, ∅, ..., ∅) < (a, s, k, ∅, ..., ∅) which is to say that a ∼1 a, s ∼2 s, ∅ ≺3 k. In multicriteria decision making the idea of the lexicographic decision consists of a hierarchy or ordered set of attributes or criteria. Decision alternatives are examined initially on the basis of the first or most important criterion, If more than one alternative is ”best” or ”satisfactory” on this basis, then these are compared under the second most important criterion and so forth. The principle of order by first difference says that one alternative is ”better” than another iff the first is ”better” than the second on the most important criterion on which they differ. So let x and y be two alternatives (actions) and c1, c2, ..., cn be different criteria, xi and yi are the utilities (evaluations) of x and y. We identify x and y with their evaluation vector x = (x1, x2, ..., xn) , y = (y1, y2, ..., yn). Then ≺i is the order relation according to ci on the set of alternatives. We say that xi ∼i yi iff the alternatives x and y are indifferent according to the ci, and we say that x < y iff xi ∼i yi for i ∈ {1, 2, ..., k − 1} where 0 ≤ k − 1 ≤ n − 1 and xk ≺k yk in other words the alternative y is preferred to the alternative x , according to the criteria ck. The lexicographic decision method is a well adaptable method. It can arrange data of arbitrary scales, and it is suitable to evaluate a set of considerable alternatives. This method does not require the weight of criteria and in spite of its simlicity always arranges the alternatives, Rapcsák [18]. Some decision procedures have lexicographic decision rules to prevent ties, Temesi [20]. Sequential screening procedures illustrate another common application of the lexicographic idea. Candidates or alternatives are first screened under a given criterion (perhaps with the use of a test or an interview) and separated into ”rejects” and ”others”. In terms of ≺1 of the set of candidates, x ∼ y whenever both x and y are ”rejects”	carrier-to-noise ratio;dictionary;finite difference;lexicographical order;lexicography;lexicon;order by;projection screen;unary operation	József Dombi;Nándor Vincze	2005	Acta Cybern.		mathematical optimization;optimal decision;decision analysis;computer science;decision tree;decision rule;mathematics;lexicographic preferences;evidential reasoning approach;algorithm;weighted sum model	ML	-5.266727047891443	-20.417395300937976	172327

Typical examples occur in sales processes in e-commerce. Three modeling tasks are selected: Modeling user preferences and utilities, modeling evaluations and modeling influence factors. A central concept representing knowledge is the notion of similarity. The major technique discussed is machine learning.

The development of a FCM requires the speci4cation of the signs and magnitudes of the relevant causal relationships by one or more experts based on subjective estimates of the causal relationships. However, while it is often relatively easy to determine the sign of the causal relationship, determination of the magnitude is often problematic, and so in many cases only the signs are speci4ed. However, if only the signs are speci4ed, then only limited use can be made of the FCM. There is thus the need to provide an e1ective means for the generation of consistent estimates of the magnitude of each causal relationship. In this paper we present an integrated process for generating consistent subjective estimates of the magnitudes. ? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Batchelder, Chair Cultural Consensus Theory (CCT) consists of cognitive models for aggregating the responses of informants to test items about some domain of their shared cultural knowledge. This paper proposes variants of CCT for pooling undirected, signed graphs collected from errorprone and biased informants. Informants provide dichotomous ’plus’ or ’minus’ responses to judgments on all possible ties among a fixed set of named nodes. The primary goal is to achieve a single pooled signed graph that better reflects the ”wisdom of the crowd” for small datasets than simple marginal averaging of responses. These models break the typical CCT assumption of conditional independence of question items in two ways. First, the models attribute the quality of a response to properties of the pair of nodes in question. Both continuous and discrete nodal properties add dependencies between responses by the same informant. Second, a hard constraint on the aggregate graph imposes dependencies among the values of the aggregate graph ties. We show that graph elicitations of different kinds warrant the use of new CCT models and that the models discussed here illuminate aspects of the underlying graph structure that are otherwise hidden using standard CCT methods.	aggregate data;cognitive model;computational complexity theory;constrained optimization;cultural consensus theory;directed graph;graph (discrete mathematics);marginal model;signed graph;wisdom of the crowd	Kalin Agrawal	2015			psychology;social science;social psychology	ML	-15.090664445927066	-18.456063064575492	172719

But at the same time, there is an increase in the proportion of failure/extinction events which are extremely large. The probability of observing an extreme event remains very low, but it is markedly higher than in the system with lower degrees of connectivity. We are therefore concerned with systems whose properties are not static but which evolve dynamically over time. The focus in this paper, motivated by the empirical examples, is on networks in which the robustness or fragility of the vertices is not given, but which themselves evolve over time We give examples from complex systems such as outages in the US power grid, the robustness properties of cell biology networks, and trade links and the propagation of both currency crises and disease. We consider systems which are populated by agents which are heterogeneous in terms of their fitness for survival. The agents are connected on a network, which evolves over time. In each period agents take self-interested decisions to increase their fitness for survival to form alliances which increase the connectivity of the network. The network is subjected to external negative shocks both with respect to the size of the shock and the spatial impact of the shock. We examine the size/frequency distribution of extinctions and how this distribution evolves as the connectivity of the network grows. The results are robust with respect to the choice of statistical distribution of the shocks. The model is deliberately kept as parsimonious and simple as possible, and refrains from incorporating features such as increasing returns and externalities arising from preferential attachment which might bias the model in the direction of having the empirically observed features of many real world networks. The model still generates results consistent with the empirical evidence: increasing the number of connections causes an increase in the average fitness of agents, yet at the same time makes the system as whole more vulnerable to catastrophic failure/extinction events on an near-global scale.	attachments;complex systems;fitness function;occam's razor;population;software propagation	Paul Ormerod;Richard Colbaugh	2006	J.

To successfully design a flexible product platform, proper design of flexible platform components is critical. These components can be described as “cousin” parts as they are neither completely unique nor completely common among variants. In this paper, a multidisciplinary process for designing flexible product platform components is introduced, assuming the platform component is decided a priori. The design process starts with identification of uncertainties and generation of multiple design alternatives for embedding flexibility into the component. Design alternatives are then optimized for minimum cost, while satisfying the component performance requirements. The flexible designs are then evaluated for economic profitability under identified uncertainty, using Monte Carlo simulation. At the end, the most profitable flexible D.

The methodology is based on key pillars in environmental management, namely connecting the socioeconomic and the natural environment dimensions into a policy oriented context; integration of stakeholders with inter-sectorial synergies and tradeoffs; handling of ambiguities and uncertainties intrinsic to environmental modeling and representation of complex non-linear cause-effect relationships in the form of Fuzzy Inference Systems, capable of adapting dynamically the influence between indicators. The methodology has the potential to support the development of informed policies and improves reliability through transparent, traceable and reproducible results. The illustrative example assesses the impact of air pollution abatement policies according to expert perceptions using proactive scenarios; the results revealed that, despite some positive changes, air protection activities are missing an overall strategic vision. We developed an integrated environmental assessment model using non-monotonic FCMs.DPSIR is used as a conceptual instrument to frame the selection of FCM concepts.The model supports multi-disciplinary stakeholder participation.The model is capable of handling uncertainties using Fuzzy Logic.The model is used to perform simulations of air pollution control scenarios.	cognitive map	Asmaa Mourhir;Tajje-eddine Rachidi;Elpiniki I.

This paper introduces a Local Land Use Competition Cellular Automata (LLUC-CA) model, based on local land use competition, land suitability evaluation, demand analysis of the different land use types, and multi-target land use competition allocation algorithm to simulate land use change at a micro level. The model is applied to simulate land use changes at Jinshitan National Tourist Holiday Resort from 1988 to 2012. The results show that the simulation accuracies were 64.46%, 77.21%, 85.30% and 99.14% for the agricultural land, construction land, forestland and water, respectively. In addition, comparing the simulation results of the LLUC-CA and CA-Markov model with the real land use data, their overall spatial accuracies were found to be 88.74% and 86.82%, respectively. In conclusion, the results from this study indicated that the model was an acceptable method for the simulation of large-scale land use changes, and the approach used here is applicable to analyzing the land use change driven forces and assist in decision-making.	algorithm;cellular automaton;certificate authority;markov chain;markov model;simulation	Junru Su;Fei Chen;Peng Xie;Quansheng Ge	2016	ISPRS Int.

This requires proper handling of conflicting factors, which can benefit from the domain of multiple criteria decision making (MCDM). However, the indexes and factors representing the stock performance are often imprecise or vague and this should be represented by linguistic terms characterized by fuzzy numbers. The aim of this research is to first develop three group MCDM methods, then use them for selecting undervalued stocks by dint of financial ratios and subjective judgments of experts. This study proposes three versions of fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution): conventional TOPSIS (C-TOPSIS), adjusted TOPSIS (A-TOPSIS) and modified TOPSIS (M-TOPSIS) where a new fuzzy distance measure, derived from the confidence level of the experts and fuzzy performance ratings have been included in the proposed methods. The practical aspects of the proposed methods are demonstrated through a case study in the Tehran stock exchange (TSE), which is timely given the need for investors to select undervalued stocks in untapped markets in the anticipation of easing economic sanctions from a change in recent government leadership.	fuzzy number;vagueness	Adel Hatami-Marbini;Fatemeh Kangi	2017	Appl.

In this paper, we propose mesoscopic individual–based model of opinion dynamics which tackles the role of context by considering influence of different sources of information during life cycle of agents. The model combines several sub–models such as model of generation and broadcasting of messages by mass media, model of daily activity, contact model based on multiplex network and model of information processing. To show the applicability of the approach, we present two scenarios illustrating the effect of the conflicting strategies of informational influence on a population and polarization of opinions about topical subject.	agent-based model;cognition;existential quantification;information processing;mesoscopic physics;multiplexing;polarization (waves);population;social proof	Ivan Derevitskii;Oksana Severiukhina;Klavdiya Bochenina;Daniil V.

Even though this principle is often useful when evaluating a decision situation it is virtually impossible, except in very artificial situations, to use the more basic decision rules with its unrealistically strong requirements for the input data, and other candidate methods must be considered instead. This article provides an overview and brings attention to some of the possibilities to utilize more elaborated decision methods, while still keeping the computational issues at a tractable level.

Artificial intelligence, in turn, seeks to create machines that can achieve these levels of efficiency in human-machine interaction. However, as reinforced in this paper, people's decisions are systematically less efficient - i.e., less fair and favorable - with machines than with humans. To understand the cause of this bias, we resort to a well-known experimental economics model: Fehr and Schmidt's inequity aversion model. This model accounts for people's aversion to disadvantageous outcome inequality (envy) and aversion to advantageous outcome inequality (guilt). We present an experiment where participants engaged in the ultimatum and dictator games with human or machine counterparts. By fitting this data to Fehr and Schmidt's model, we show that people acted as if they were just as envious of humans as of machines; but, in contrast, people showed less guilt when making unfavorable decisions to machines. This result, thus, provides critical insight into this bias people show, in economic settings, in favor of humans. We discuss implications for the design of machines that engage in social decision making with humans.	artificial intelligence;humans;human–computer interaction;risk aversion;schmidt decomposition;social inequality	Celso de Melo;Jonathan Gratch	2015	2015 International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII)	10.1109/ACII.2015.7344589	psychology;games;data modeling;computer science;artificial intelligence;bias;social psychology	HCI	-13.919167272079575	-12.61257386646301	174157

Previous research of MeMAS has developed a computational framework in which a series of memetic operations have been designed for implementing multiple interacting agents. This paper further endeavors to address the specific challenges that arise in more complex multi-agent settings where agents share a common setting with other agents who have different and even competitive objectives. Particularly, we propose a memetic multiagent demonstration learning approach (MeMAS-P) with improvement over existing work to allow agents to improve their performance by building candidate models and accordingly predicting behaviors of their opponents. Experiments based on an adapted minefield navigation task have shown that MeMAS-P could provide agents with ability to acquire increasing level of learning capability and reduce the candidate model space by sharing meme-inspired demonstrations with respect to their representative knowledge and unique candidate models.	agent-based model;experiment;interaction;meme;memetics;multi-agent system	Yaqing Hou;Yifeng Zeng;Yew-Soon Ong	2016			computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;management science;memetic algorithm	AI	-16.299333137908302	-11.17975719125205	174919

This paper takes this research forward by using linguistic variables and triangular fuzzy numbers to model the decision maker’s (DM) risk and confidence attitudes in order to define a more complete MCDM solution. To illustrate the computation process and demonstrate the feasibility of the results we use a travel problem that has been used previously to assess MCDM techniques. The results show that the method is useful for tackling imprecision and subjectivity in complex, ill-defined and human-oriented decision problems. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Some of the players have privileged information about the boxers and part of them can provide this information to uninformed players. However, this information may be true if the informed player is altruist or false if he is selfish. So, in this game, the players are divided in three categories: informed and altruist players, informed and selfish players, and uninformed players. By considering the matchings (N/2 distinct pairs of randomly chosen players) and that the payoff of the winning group follows aspects captured from two important games, the public goods game and minority game, we showed quantitatively and qualitatively how the altruism can impact on the privileged information. We localized analytically the regions of positive payoffs which were corroborated by numerical simulations performed for all values of information and altruism densities given that we know the information level of the informed players. Finally, in an evolutionary version of the game ,we showed that the gain of the informed players can get worse if we adopted the following procedure: the players increase their investment for situations of positive payoffs, and decrease their investment when negative payoffs occur.

This paper investigates the relationship among corporate strategies, environmental forces, and the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) performance measures. Corporate strategies are explored within the framework of Miles and Snow’s taxonomy, where they are categorized into prospectors, defenders, analyzers, and reactors. The relative weights for each performance measure are calculated by the use of the Analytic Hierarchy Process. A sample of 219 companies can confirm the link between corporate strategies, environmental forces, and the weights of the BSC performance measures. These weights shift depending on the nature of challenges companies face. In the light of this empirical evidence, a decision support system is proposed to help retrieve the BSC weights of the companies with similar characteristics. In order to measure the proximity between companies, a k-nearest neighbor technique is employed. This system can help find the weights of the performance measures for particular strategies. q 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We model the competing tendencies of imitation and non-conformity by incorporating an off-threshold into standard threshold models of behavior. In this way, we attempt to capture important aspects of fashions and general societal trends. Allowing varying amounts of stochasticity in both the network and node responses, we find different outcomes in the random and deterministic versions of the model. In the limit of a large, dense network, however, we show that these dynamics coincide. The dynamical behavior of the system ranges from steady state to chaotic depending on network connectivity and update synchronicity. We construct a mean field theory for general random networks. In the undirected case, the mean field theory predicts that the dynamics on the network are a smoothed version of the average node response dynamics. We compare our theory to extensive simulations on Poisson random graphs with node responses that average to the chaotic tent map.	conformity;dynamical system;flow network;graph (discrete mathematics);quantum field theory;random graph;simulation;smoothing;social network;steady state;stochastic process;synchronicity;tent map;threshold model	Kameron Decker Harris	2012	CoRR		combinatorics;machine learning;exponential random graph models;social psychology	ML	-13.732181148463727	-16.540382647443423	176033

At the same time, statistically it has been determined that a longer shopping path leads to a higher purchase volume and higher volume customers have the possibility of spending more time within the inner part of a sales floor. Thus, we expect an improvement in purchasing by opening shopping paths into the inner areas to enhance customers' chances to discover new products. Realising an effective path extension to increase customers' purchases requires us to perceive the features of higher and lower volume customers. The study aims to establish a classification rule based on customers' behavioural features within inner areas. The paper provides an explanation of our method to quantify customers' behavioural features and reports the outcomes from the exploratory analysis using real-world shopping path and purchase data.

In an ANP network there is both the ability and the need to test for additional levels of consistency or coherency among the priority vectors. Examples are used to highlight cases where a Supermatrix with priority vectors that were obtained from either perfect or nearly perfect consistent pairwise comparison matrices generates suboptimal decisions. Simulations are used to further demonstrate the frequency of these occurrences in general ANP networks. A form of cross validation within the Supermatrix called linking validation is developed and demonstrated. The linking validation method allows decision makers to use the priority vectors within the Supermatrix to validate other priority vectors within the Supermatrix. The linking validation method involves generating linking estimates. The linking estimates are compared against each other to identify the most incoherent priority vector by calculating the Linking Coherency Index (LCI) scores. The decision maker can then update the specified priority vector and repeat this process until the LCI-score for every linking estimate is below the given threshold. The use of linking validation to test for coherency further improves the validity of ANP models.

It was further found that the sure-thing principle was also obeyed in the original prison sentence payoffs, which fall into the domain of losses.

The first algorithm relies on the exchange of information about a transaction instance, whereas the second algorithm uses qualitative information provided by individual agents, such as the results of predictions from the agentýs local perspective. We apply the architecture and strategies to a distributed supply chain prediction problem. Experiments run on a large real-world order data set indicate that our approach effectively improves the learning performance based on limited additional communication between the participating agents.	agent-based model;algorithm;experiment	Yutao Guo;Jörg P.

Selection of a robot from among the large number available in the market to suit a particular application and production environment has become a difficult task. Many methods for robot selection have been developed to date. Keeping in view the research works on industrial robot selection, a subjective and objective integrated multiple attribute decision making method is proposed in this paper for the purpose of robot selection. The method considers the objective weights of importance of the attributes as well as the subjective preferences of the decision maker to decide the integrated weights of importance of the attributes. Furthermore, the method uses fuzzy logic to convert the qualitative attributes into the quantitative attributes. Three examples are presented to illustrate the potential of the proposed method. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	deployment environment;fuzzy logic;industrial robot	R. V. Rao;B. K.

Recent empirical data shows that networks representing the social interactions between people exhibit typically high average connectivity and associated single-to-broad-scale heterogeneity, a feature which precludes the emergence of cooperation in any static network. Here, we employ a model in which individuals are able to self-organize both their strategy and their social ties throughout evolution, based exclusively on their self-interest. The entangled evolution of individual strategy and network structure provides a key mechanism toward the sustainability of cooperation in social networks. The results show that simple topological dynamics reflecting the individual capacity for self-organization of social ties can produce realistic networks of high average connectivity with associated single-to-broad-scale heterogeneity, in which cooperation thrives.	emergence;integrative level;interaction;living systems;self-organization;social network	Jorge M.

Understanding these processes requires linking individual behavioral rules of insects to a choice dynamics at the colony level. In a homogeneous environment, the German cockroach Blattella germanica displays self-amplified aggregation behavior. In a heterogeneous environment where several shelters are present, groups of cockroaches collectively select one of them. In this article, we demonstrate that the restriction of the self-amplified aggregation behavior to distinct zones in the environment can explain the emergence of a collective decision at the level of the group. This hypothesis is tested with robotics experiments and dedicated computer simulations. We show that the collective decision is influenced by the available spaces to explore and to aggregate in, by the size of the population involved in the aggregation process and by the probability of encounter zones while the robots explore the environment. We finally discuss these results from both a biological and a robotics point of view.	robot	Simon Garnier;Jacques Gautrais;Masoud Asadpour;Christian Jost;Guy Theraulaz	2009	Adaptive Behaviour	10.1177/1059712309103430	computer simulation;swarm robotics;selection;self-organization;simulation;group decision-making;computer science;artificial intelligence;ant colony;principle;path;communication	Robotics	-17.022495687687737	-14.415138235546138	178483

Effective job accommodation strategies can assist the people with disabilities in general, and hearing impaired people, who accounted for a majority of the disabilities in the labor market, in special, to expand their capability set and maximize their work performance. However, very few researches have been developed on how the job accommodation strategies can be defined. Furthermore, most available job accommodation strategies as well as assistive technologies were based on researches being developed one decade ago, which are not feasible and should be updated for modern industries. Thus, a fuzzy DEMATEL based MCDM framework will be introduced for deriving suitable accommodation strategies. An empirical study based on the operators from the electronic industry advanced and verified both available job accommodation strategies as well as job accommodation research methods. In the future, the proposed strategies as well as the research framework can be used to enhance the welfare of the disabilities.	assistive technology;job scheduler;job shop scheduling	Chi-Yo Huang;Gwo-Hshiung Tzeng	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)	10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007683	job design;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;conceptual framework;management science;fuzzy set;empirical research;multiple-criteria decision analysis;job analysis;limiting;pragmatics	Robotics	-7.548566285456215	-18.965933585751234	178624

In the multiagent model, these net works depict the dependencies among the agents. The dependencies reflect the r elation between the goals of the agents and the agents who have the power to achiev e t m. Like any social structure, also a multiagent system can be regulated b y a set of norms and institutional powers that form an institution. Differentl y than informal social networks, the institutional social structure has an inherent d ynamic character which cannot be captured by the current dependence networks. The n etworks have to reflect the changes of dependencies among agents created by the e xercis of institutional powers. The aim of this paper is to define more dynamic s ocial networks. From a description of an agent system it is possible to build a static dependence network. In the same way we describe how to pass from an abstract re pres ntation of what is an institution with its institutional powers to a dyn amic social dependence network.	agent-based model;multi-agent system;social network;social structure	Serena Villata	2008		10.3233/978-1-58603-893-9-187	social dynamics;social entropy;evolving networks;computer science;dynamic network analysis;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;social network;norm	AI	-18.18207238500541	-15.573868338478276	178767

The system developed employs a simple genetic algorithm to evolve an optimized trading approach for every agent, with their trading decisions based on a range of technical indicators generating trading signals. Their trading pattern follows a simple fitness function of maximizing net assets for every evolutionary cycle. Their performance is analyzed compared to market movements as represented by its index, as well as investment funds run by human professionals to establish a relative measure of success. The results show that the developed system performs comparably to its human counterparts across different market environments, despite these agents being rather primitive in nature. Future forthcoming work refines and explores the potential of this approach further.	agent-based model;algorithmic trading;fitness function;genetic algorithm;index (publishing);language primitive	Cyril Schoreels;Brian Logan;Jonathan M.

22850e5c7c9d5b1e06792dd3231d8d4657f4e8fd	criticality metric for the safety validation of automated driving using model predictive trajectory optimization		The safety validation of automated driving of SAE level 3 and higher (AD) is still an unsolved issue. In the validation process, criticality metrics can be used for two different purposes. First, for the identification of test scenarios from recorded data that are later tested in simulation. Secondly, for an estimation of the safety of a specific AD system based on the likelihood of critical situations in test drives or in other words as a safety surrogate. In the past, different metrics for those purposes have been defined that work well in specific scenarios such as longitudinal traffic. However, a metric that describes criticality in all situations and is applicable to human and AD traffic is currently not available. In this paper, an approach to define a criticality metric is introduced. The metric is based on the definition of criticality as the level of driving requirements in the specific situation. The computation of the proposed metric uses elements of model predictive control using an objective function that contains four elements that describe the difficulty of the driving task. Based on those demands and a simplified driving dynamics model, the solution with the minimal criticality is computed. Finally, the metric is tested in four test scenarios that are typical for highway traffic. A short parameter variation study is conducted in order to study certain effects of the algorithm and to identify room for improvement.

These are: Bayesian confirmation property, two properties related to the case of entailment or refutation, called Ex1 and logicality L, and a group of symmetry properties. We propose a modification of properties Ex1 and L, called weak Ex1, and weak L, that deploy the concept of confirmation in its larger sense. We demonstrate that properties Ex1 and L do not fully reflect such understanding of the confirmation concept, and thus, we propose to substitute Ex1 by weak Ex1 and L by weak L. Moreover, we introduce four new approaches to normalization of confirmation measures in order to transform measures so that they would obtain desired properties. The analysis of the results of the normalizations of the confirmation measures takes into account all considered properties. We advocate for two normalized confirmation measures: measure Z considered in the literature, and newly proposed measure A. Finally, we provide some ideas for combining them in a single measure keeping all desirable properties.	emoticon;expect;flickr;l (complexity);mac address;maximal set	Salvatore Greco;Roman Slowinski;Izabela Szczech	2012	Inf.

Agents are modeled from multi-disciplinary perspectives and their behavioral strategies are evolved over time via collective co-evolution and independent learning. Experimental results reveal the onset of fascinating global emergent phenomenon as well as interesting patterns of group movement and behavioral development. Analysis of the results provides new insights into the intricate behavioral dynamics that arises in civil upheavals. Collectively, EMAS serves as a vehicle to facilitate the behavioral development of autonomous agents as well as a platform to verify the effectiveness of various violence management policies which is paramount to the mitigation of casualties.	autonomous agent;autonomous robot;capability maturity model;edinburgh multiple access system;emergence;game theory;holism;interaction;interpupillary distance;multi-agent system;onset (audio);simulation;social network	Chi Keong Goh;Hanyang Quek;Kay Chen Tan;Hussein A.

To solve the problem, screening alternative method based on the soft set theory is proposed. Taking the screening alternative problem with two departments as a case, the three rules of screening alternatives and the calculation process of screening alternatives are given. In the proposed method, the soft set on the index requirements and the alternatives that reach the index requirements for each department is first constructed. Then, evaluation index subsets concerning the acceptable level and the satisfactory level provided by each department are set up, respectively. Further, the soft sets concerning the acceptable levels and the satisfactory levels are constructed based on the evaluation index subsets. Afterwards, according to a selected screening alternative rule, the constructed soft sets are integrated using the ∧-products and the uni  −  int operators to obtain the screening alternative set satisfying the rule. In addition, the screening alternatives processes considering multiple departments and the different importance of indexes are also given, respectively. Finally, an example is used to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.	set theory	Mingyang Li;Zhi-Ping Fan;Tian-Hui You	2018	Appl.

This paper aims to assess the impact of human resource spirituality on the success of organizational strategic change projects. The success of the projects is measured by the well-known criterion of deviation from the planned budget cost. Data collection is based on a questionnaire survey of 252 personnel in 36 large and medium-scale organizational change projects in power industry. The paper proposes an integrated algorithm of fuzzy data envelopment analysis (FDEA) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for measuring the pure effect of human resource spirituality on the success of organizational change projects in the power industry.

In this paper, we look at how the existence of modules in the contact structure of a population affects its adoption of an innovation that is characterized by a given perceived advantage. For this we consider both theoretical models of modular networks as well as the empirical social network of a village in Karnataka. We first use a network generalization of the well-known Bass model of diffusion, which is a variant of the SI compartmental model of contagion propagation, on the empirical network and on an ensemble of degree-preserved randomized surrogates. By comparing the dynamics of the diffusion process in these networks, we see that the modular organization reduces the speed of adoption in the population. However, as there are limitations of the diffusion model, we have also considered an alternative dynamical process based on spin-spin interaction that is inspired by statistical physics. Here, individuals try to coordinate their action with that of neighbors on the contact network, while having randomly distributed thresholds (that measures their inrinsic resistance to adoption). By varying the external field, which is a measure of the perceived advantage of the innovation we observe transitions of the population to a state of complete adoption. While the model network with community organization shows that the occurrence of modularity increases the critical value of perceived advantage at which the transition happens, surprisingly we see that in the empirical network the process of adoption can occur faster than in the corresponding degree-preserved randomized surrogate. We show that by reducing the inter-modular connectivity of the empirical network, the process can indeed be made slower than the corresponding randomized networks. Our results underline the critical importance of modular organization in social networks in affecting the process of adoption of innovation in society.	mesoscopic physics;multi-compartment model;randomized algorithm;randomness;social network;software propagation;surrogates;whole earth 'lectronic link	Chandrashekar Kuyyamudi;Sitabhra Sinha	2015	2015 7th International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)	10.1109/COMSNETS.2015.7098710	simulation;artificial intelligence;mathematical model;computer security;statistics	ML	-13.91658591216458	-16.7946657847848	180484

This process will help the concerned user to take steps and actions accordingly in order to address risks and achieve the activity’s desired goals. Various techniques and approaches for risk management have been discussed in the literature. But the process of risk management is not generic and it varies and changes according to the domain or purpose of the interaction for which it is being considered. E-business interactions are collaborative interactions that are mostly carried out over a virtual environment. But by considering the growth of e-business interactions, a process of risk management is needed by which the interacting user can actually minimize and lessen the level of risk before decision-making. In this paper, a quantitative approach for risk management in e-business interactions is proposed which the interacting user can utilize to lessen the level of risk and then make an interaction-based decision.	electronic business;fuzzy logic;interaction;risk aversion;risk management;serial ata;virtual reality	Omar Khadeer Hussain	2010	2010 IEEE 7th International Conference on E-Business Engineering	10.1109/ICEBE.2010.101	e-commerce;risk management tools;risk management;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;operating system;data mining;management science;risk management information systems;fuzzy set	DB	-10.826365983898137	-11.774325678827767	180488

Making use of the well-connected microblog network, a highly influential user (or opinion leader) can be of great importance, with commercial, social, or even political values. In this paper, we discuss the conditions and methods to become an opinion leader based on game theory. First, the standards of a leader are to be discussed. We then present a set of parameters to describe the intrinsic features of a user, and build a game theory model to simulate the evolution of microblog network and the spread or shrinkage of the user influence. The simulation results shows that players with high quality messages are the fountainhead of the majority of opinion leaders. Among the leaders, an one-person microblog account better follows someone with a rate applying uniform distribution, while a robot or multi-person account becomes a team leader by following someone with a rate applying poisson distribution.	display resolution;game theory;internet;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Jingyuan Li;Guoliang Xing;Yuanzhuo Wang;Yan Ren	2012	2012 Second International Conference on Cloud and Green Computing	10.1109/CGC.2012.76	public relations;positive political theory;political science;advertising;social psychology	DB	-15.503334296344104	-15.285407930124807	180506

In the strategic conceptual design of a product, the relationship between the product attributes and market performance (i.e. customer preference in a market) is modeled. The historical relationship shows how the trend in customer preferences has changed over the period and we observed this trend is closely related to economic conditions of a market. The trend of customers’ preferences is again modeled in terms of related economic factors. Finally, the estimated model is used for predicting the market performance of a concept and selecting the best concept. Demonstrating the usefulness of the approach, we employ the conceptual design of mid-sized passenger aircraft in this work. Market performances of 15 concepts of future mid-sized passenger aircraft that will be sold in 2020–2030 are predicted considering global economic conditions of the global oil price, global gross...	performance prediction	Soonyoung Han;Hae-Jin Choi	2014	Concurrent Engineering: R&A	10.1177/1063293X14546671	simulation;engineering;automotive engineering;transport engineering	DB	-6.27690014616405	-17.013974910763043	180776

To investigate this issue, we apply the Human-Environment System framework formulated by Scholz (2011) as a conceptual guide to read typical feedback loops in land-use systems. We use an agent-based land-use change model (LUDAS) developed by Le et al. (2008, 2010) to test the sensitivity of long-term land-use dynamics to the inclusion of secondary feedback loop learning with respect to different system performance indicators at different levels of aggregation. Simulation experiments were based on a case study that was carried out in the Hong Ha watershed (Vietnam). We specified two model versions that represent two mechanisms of human adaptation in land-use decisions to environmental changes that emerged from land-use actions. The first mechanism includes only primary feedback loop learning, i.e. households adapt to the annual change in socio-ecological conditions and direct environmental response to land-use activities. The second mechanism includes the first one and secondary feedback loop learning, in which households can change their behavioural model in response to changes in socio-ecological conditions at the landscape-community level in the longer term. Spatial-temporal patterns of land-use and interrelated community income changes driven from the two feedback mechanisms are compared in order to evaluate the added value of the inclusion of secondary feedback loop learning. The results demonstrate that the effect of the added secondary feedback loop learning on land-use dynamics depends on domain type, time scale, and aggregation level of the impact indicators.	agent-based model;agent-based social simulation	Quang Bao Le;Roman Seidl;Roland W.

Several techniques such as: neural networks, analytic hierarchy process, and software agents are used to implement a software prototype that has been validated in an operational environment with a concept trial. Better working conditions were reached by freeing up the technicians for other functions, given that they should not carry out the tedious and stressful activities included in the spare parts process. Such tasks were completed according to the time that was established in the customers’ service level agreements to avoid penalties. Operating expenditure was cut in a significant way. An increase of the overall industrial process performance was also accomplished as the spare parts management time dropped. This is, as far as we know, the first time that a combination of these techniques was applied to manage a spare parts inventory and prioritize incidents in such a complex scenario as the optical transmission network of a major telecommunications’ operator. The framework might be used in other domains such as: the hardware replacements that are required in some critical operational environments.	analytical hierarchy;artificial neural network;optimizing compiler;prototype;service-level agreement;software agent;software prototyping	Mary Luz Mouronte-López	2017	Journal of Network and Systems Management	10.1007/s10922-017-9412-5	real-time computing;analytic hierarchy process;spare part;telecommunications network;spare parts management;software agent;computer security;computer science;operating expense;software;distributed computing;service level	Robotics	-7.661838368737363	-15.23064233130857	181120

The airport management is constantly looking for methods to improve its performance, both in terms of profitability and quality of service and the proper planning of passenger flows. To address these issues, scientific research provides methods and tools for decision support at all planning levels (i.e., strategic, tactical, operational, real time). In recent literature, it is now widely recognized that the hybridization of simulation and optimization systems is a very reliable technique for such decisions. This work intends to present an efficient Decision Support System framework based on the hybridization of a discrete event simulator and a Logit model. In order to show the effectiveness of the framework, we show the results of a real case study in North Italy.	computation;consistency model;decision support system;logistic regression;mathematical optimization;quality of service;row echelon form;simulation;usb hub	Guido Perboli;Marco Ghirardi;Luca Gobbato;Gabriele Benedetti	2011	2011 11th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications	10.1109/ISDA.2011.6121749	simulation;scientific method;quality of service;decision support system;computer science;discrete event simulation;logistic regression;tourism;operations research;profitability index;aviation	Robotics	-15.381981308113904	-23.328089748122803	181646

Supplier selection has received extensive attention in the just-in-time approach. Supplier selection and evolution are decisions of strategic importance to companies. Thus, supplier performance evaluation is very important in choosing the right supplier for the right product. In this paper, a method for supplier selection using fuzzy logic was performed. Fuzzy logic enables us to emulate the human reasoning process and make decisions based on imprecise data. The method is based on calculating a fuzzy suitability index for the efficient vendor alternatives, and then ranking the fuzzy indices to select the best supplier alternatives. 1. Introduction In today's highly competitive environment, an effective supplier selection process is very important to the success of any manufacturing organisation (Liv and Hai 2005). In this case, selection of the right supplier becomes more important. This is confirmed by many researchers (Bevilacqua and Petroni 2002, Kumar et al. 2004, Liv and Hai 2005, and Kumar et al. 2006). In designing a supply chain, a decision maker must consider the selection of the right supplier and their quota allocation (Kumar et al. 2004). As a result, increased concern for supplier selection has taken place, which is probably owing to the fact that supplier selection may be the single most important phase of the purchasing process (Pearson and Ellram 1995). Purchasing managers need periodically to evaluate supplier performance in order to retain those suppliers who meet their requirements in terms of several performance criteria (Bevilacqua and Petroni 2002). In recent years, research into just-in-time (JIT) production from various viewpoints has been carried out all over the world (Takahashi et al. 2004) and the application of JIT concept to supply chain management has been attempted (Zimmer 2002, Kim and Ha 2003).

The ABM-HPC framework provides an in silico testbed to explore how short-term/small-scale patterns of individual human behavior and long-term/large-scale patterns of environmental change act together to influence human dispersal, survival and extinction scenarios. These topics are currently at the center of the Neanderthal debate, i.e., the question why Neanderthals died out during the Late Pleistocene, while modern humans dispersed over the entire globe. To tackle this and similar questions, simulations typically adopt one of two opposing approaches, top-down (equation-based) and bottom-up (agent-based) models of population dynamics. We propose HPC technology as an essential computational tool to bridge the gap between these approaches. Using the numerical simulation of worldwide human dispersals as an example, we show that integrating different levels of model hierarchy into an ABM-HPC simulation framework provides new insights into emergent properties of the model, and into the potential and limitations of agent-based versus continuum models.	agent-based model	Simone Callegari;John David Weissmann;Natalie Tkachenko;Wesley P.

Both types of actions have effects on info-targets and aim at influencing them by generating in them feelings and behaviors. CIMIC projects through CIMIC advertising and PSYOPS through messages diffusion both conducted by Allied forces. In both cases, the effects are propagated from the direct info-targets to the people they are connected to, directly or indirectly, through the social networks they belong to. In this article, we describe CIMIC and PSYOPS actions, we then present the different types of social networks concerned and explain the mechanism that underlies the propagation of effects from people to people in these social networks. Finally, we present the G-DEVS simulation models for the people to people direct propagation of both types of actions. This study is carried out in the context of the CAPRICORN system, whose goal is to assess psychological effects of combat actions, CIMIC actions and psychological actions.

This research is important because empirical approaches are no longer adequate for complex and diverse modern societies. Results of a simulation experiment have revealed the possibility that improving consumer trust in product recall actions is useful for producers and makes it possible to sell expensive products. We believe this work can contribute to support of government staff for improving product recall systems and to support of executive officers of product companies deliberating about recall decision strategies.	multi-agent system;social simulation	Tetsuroh Watanabe;Taro Kanno;Kazuo Furuta	2018		10.1145/3205651.3205672	multi-objective optimization;artificial intelligence;artificial society;knowledge management;computer science;machine learning;genetic programming;recall;social simulation;government	ML	-10.160347179165095	-11.212430017161779	182407

They are so because ants are simple, non-cognitive, distributed and autonomous and yet they solve an optimisation problem that is very complex and dynamic. This is very desirable in computer science, but as of yet not much research has gone into explaining the underlying mechanisms of division of labour. The venue in this paper is to, by means of evolutionary algorithms, find the implications spatial constraints play in the division of labour in a foraging task of virtual ants. The ants differ only in size, and size implies constraints regarding to ease of movement in an environment where obstacles of other ants and clay exists. The results show that spatial constraints do play a major role in the job-task division evolved, in that test setup with increasing constraints exhibited division of labour in that ants of different sizes occupy different spatial areas of the task domain. In the process, we have evolved the behaviour of the ants that underlie the division of labour. This was done via mapping functions and motivation networks.	apache ant (another neat tool)	Jesper Bach Larsen	2001		10.1007/3-540-44811-X_36	role model;division of labour;genetic algorithm;computer science;artificial intelligence;ant colony;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;algorithm	Vision	-17.16040192701531	-14.349767516737035	182423

Here we present an evolutionary analysis of how interbrand relationships can be expected to evolve in the cognitive radio domain over long time scales. We find that a range of trajectories are possible, and that the eventual outcomes depend on a variety of system parameters including the number of users and transmission band switching costs. Starting from previous bio-socially inspired fair spectrum sharing protocols, we put forward an extended model of secondary user etiquette that allows for a range of inter-group dynamics to arise in the natural course of competition over and co-use of spectrum resources. We show that as populations grow, increases in transmission switching costs lead to evolutionary pressures toward increasing antagonism between brands, and that in such scenarios devices tend to segregate by brand across bands. Understanding the drivers behind emerging inter-brand dynamics from an evolutionary perspective is an important input to the long term view of the successful application of distributed spectrum access and cognitive radio.	british informatics olympiad;cognitive radio;digital ecosystem;population	Anna Wisniewska;Bilal Khan;Ala I.

Hence, many importance measures have been proposed to identify the important components in a network with respect to vulnerability and rank them accordingly based on individual importance measure. However, in this paper, we propose a new approach to identify the most important network components based on multiple importance measures using a multi criteria decision making (MCDM) method, namely the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), able to take into account the preferences of decision-makers. We consider multiple edge-specific flowbased importance measures provided as the multiple criteria of a network where the alternatives are the edges. Accordingly, TOPSIS is used to rank the edges of the network based on their importance considering multiple different importance measures. The proposed approach is illustrated through different networks with different densities along with the effects of weighs.	decision analysis;multiple edges	Yasser A.

Each stage of the approach is controlled by a graphical user interface which allows a team of non-expert modellers to compare the outcomes of multiple model simulations and to decide what further simulation is needed. A distinguishing feature of the method is that it allows the goal of the management strategies to arise as a result of the interaction between the user and the model, rather than being defined a priori, as well as to change during the process in response to the information and the insight such modelling may provide. We envisage that a management team, rather than a single user, may also employ the method as an avenue for communication, in order to discuss the potentially conflicting aspects of different model outcomes along the path to finding workable compromises. We discuss an application of the approach to the sustainable management of a recreational fishery in a marine park in Western Australia.	graphical user interface;simulation	F.

271754cf1d42b2b695a542171889aba9b1a97057	extracting knowledge of customers’ preferences in massively multiplayer online role playing games		Due to fierce competition in game markets, to identify customers’ true needs is one of the crucial factors in online game industry. Traditionally, game producers heavily rely on game testers, who are primarily responsible for analyzing computer games, finding software defects and being a part of quality control process, to achieve this goal. But, it is not often reliable. To ensure the investment can be returned, game producers need an effective approach to discover frequently shifted customer preferences in time. Recently, Kano model and data mining techniques have been successfully applied to recognize customers’ preferences and implement customer relationship management tasks, respectively. However, in traditional Kano analysis, only basically statistical analysis techniques are used, and they are insufficient to provide advanced knowledge to enterprisers. Therefore, in order to discover the relationship between/among quality elements in Kano model and to extract knowledge related to customer preferences, this study proposes a knowledge acquisition scheme that integrates several data mining techniques including association rule discovery, decision tree, and self-organizing map neural network, into traditional Kano model. An actual case of customer satisfaction survey regarding massively multiplayer online role playing game has been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.	algorithm;artificial neural network;association rule learning;customer relationship management;data mining;decision tree;display device;game testing;knowledge acquisition;list of algorithms;massively multiplayer online role-playing game;organizing (structure);pc game;self-organization;self-organizing map;sensor;software bug	Long-Sheng Chen;Pao-Chung Chang	2012	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-012-1145-5	simulation;knowledge management;machine learning;game developer	AI	-5.6101550957052675	-14.568812318089766	183302

In this paper, we perform the first systematic study of poisoning attacks and their countermeasures for linear regression models. In poisoning attacks, attackers deliberately influence the training data to manipulate the results of a predictive model. We propose a theoretically-grounded optimization framework specifically designed for linear regression and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of datasets and models. We also introduce a fast statistical attack that requires limited knowledge of the training process. Finally, we design a new principled defense method that is highly resilient against all poisoning attacks. We provide formal guarantees about its convergence and an upper bound on the effect of poisoning attacks when the defense is deployed. We evaluate extensively our attacks and defenses on three realistic datasets from health care, loan assessment, and real estate domains.	algorithm;machine learning;mathematical optimization;predictive modelling	Matthew Jagielski;Alina Oprea;Battista Biggio;Chang Liu;Cristina Nita-Rotaru;Bo Li	2018	2018 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)	10.1109/SP.2018.00057	computer science;computer security;robust regression;robustness (computer science);machine learning;real estate;regression;data modeling;countermeasure;artificial intelligence;adversarial machine learning;convergence (routing)	Security	-12.301274854780898	-10.244009646603626	183373

Various techniques have been developed aiming at making recommendations to the group as a whole, but satisfying all group members in an even way still remains as a challenge. We propose a multi-agent approach based on negotiation techniques for group recommendation. In this approach we use the multilateral monotonic concession protocol to combine individual recommendations into a group recommendation. We applied our proposal in the movies domain. The results obtained indicate that using this negotiation protocol, users in the groups were more evenly satisfied than with traditional ranking aggregation approaches.

Therefore, it would be beneficial if recommender systems of different organizations can cooperate together sharing their resources and recommendations. In this paper, we propose a preliminary design of a distributed recommender system that consists of multiple recommender systems from different organizations. Moreover, a peer selection algorithm is also presented that allows a recommender system peer to select a set of other peers to cooperate with. The proposed selection mechanism not only ensures a high degree of user satisfaction to the generated recommendation, it also makes sure that every peer has been fairly treated and studied. The paper also further points out how the proposed distributed recommender system and the peer selection algorithm can provide a solution to the problem of resource lacking (e.g. cold start problem) and also enables recommender systems to provide recommendations with better novelty and quality to users.	e-commerce;recommender system;selection algorithm	Li-Tung Weng;Yue Xu;Yuefeng Li;Richi Nayak	2006			computer science;knowledge management;machine learning;data mining;world wide web;recommender system	ML	-11.337255810347536	-12.52728280368081	183691
243f1e2b84d3c05767c3ec9ea5f5f071effe9958	risk sensitivity and assortment in social dilemmas		Uncertainty and risk are key features of many social dilemmas, where individual decisions are often made with imperfect knowledge and variance in outcomes. In this paper, we investigate the evolutionary dynamics of the well-known public goods game using a recently introduced modelling framework encapsulating risk-sensitive assortment. Here, the population ofmobile agents playing the game is divided into fixed-sized interaction groups. Individuals are defined by a single genetic trait—a risk sensitivity trait— that guides their decision-making. This trait is mapped to a continuous range of investment levels and also provides a mechanism to guidemobility (migration) decisions. Detailed computational simulation experiments confirm the relationship between risk orientation, decision-making and mobility in the game. As the size of each group increases, assortment levels tend to decrease and risk-averse individuals tend to dominate the population. However, in many scenarios, there was high variance in the proportion of ‘cooperators’ both in groups and between different groups, suggesting that risk-seeking behaviour is an emergent property of mobility induced positive assortment.

064478fe731280689b8e0e7d66b7d4c1bc22c1a1	on the dynamical interplay between awareness and epidemic spreading in multiplex networks		We present the analysis of the interrelation between two processes accounting for the spreading of an epidemic, and the information awareness to prevent its infection, on top of multiplex networks. This scenario is representative of an epidemic process spreading on a network of persistent real contacts, and a cyclic information awareness process diffusing in the network of virtual social contacts between the same individuals. The topology corresponds to a multiplex network where two diffusive processes are interacting affecting each other. The analysis using a microscopic Markov chain approach reveals the phase diagram of the incidence of the epidemics and allows us to capture the evolution of the epidemic threshold depending on the topological structure of the multiplex and the interrelation with the awareness process. Interestingly, the critical point for the onset of the epidemics has a critical value (metacritical point) defined by the awareness dynamics and the topology of the virtual network, from which the onset increases and the epidemics incidence decreases.	anatomy, regional;critical point (network science);incidence matrix;interaction;markov chain;multiplexing;onset (audio);phase diagram	Clara Granell;Sergio Gómez;Alexandre Arenas	2013	Physical review letters	10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.128701		Metrics	-13.86583290221268	-17.76745477322519	183857

On the basis of the assumptions of the deterministic social-impact model in discrete time introduced by Nowak et al.

Although there are no stationary (equilibrium) solutions of the model in general, the presence of strong leaders maintaining their opinions for a long-time and strongly influencing other individuals leads to quasi-stable (steady-state) solutions. Analyzing closed individual chains, we discuss changes of the individual-opinion structure while varying a global parameter of the model.

Chinese central government has conflict with local authorities at provincial levels regarding the implementation of new carbon emission reduction policy. As the conflict takes place in multiple regions, the governments at a higher level should form strategies to interact with governments at the lower level. The resolution of this conflict obtained by calculating the stabilities in the corresponding graph model can be used as guidance of actions for each decision maker to follow. The stabilities indicate that the central government should form distinct strategies to deal with provinces with different levels of economic development.

bf15fe4a304c8bc2d09586dd903fc3c192f53cce	a land use regression variable generation, modelling and prediction tool for air pollution exposure assessment		Land use regression (LUR) is commonly used to estimate air pollution exposures for epidemiological studies. By statistically relating a set of geolocated measured pollutant values with explanatory variables defining sources and modifiers of air pollution patterns, such as land cover characteristics, traffic flow and intensity, it is possible to predict pollution levels at unsampled locations. LUR utilises simple linear regression, but the generation of predictor variables, application of the model and the supervised iterative approach to model development means an analyst must be a competent user of both GIS and statistical packages. Here we present an application to simplify the LUR modelling process for exposure scientists and environmental epidemiologists. RLUR is a user-friendly application built using the statistical and GIS capabilities of the R programming language. The main aim of this software is to provide an introduction to the LUR process without the need for specific GIS or statistical expertise. © 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	alternating direction implicit method;bespoke;geographic information system;iteration;kerrison predictor;list of statistical packages;programming language;r language;raster graphics;shapefile;usability	David Morley;John Gulliver	2018	Environmental Modelling and Software	10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.03.030	land use;hydrology;environmental resource management;exposure assessment;traffic flow;land cover;pollution;simple linear regression;computer science;r programming language;air pollution	AI	-14.69290509020329	-22.683327238575657	184535

The risk is correlated to the probability of failure, then to the failure rate, and it plays a fundamental role in the safety assessment process. This paper focuses on the failure rate evaluation methods adopted by the following functional safety standards: ISO 19014, ISO 25119, and IEC 61508. All of these standards are applicable, respectively, in the earth-moving machinery, in the tractors and machinery for agriculture and forestry, and in the industrial automation fields. As proposed by the standards, the failure rate evaluation depends on the conventional parameters like Mean Time To Failure, Diagnostic Coverage level, and Hardware Categories. Nevertheless, assuming the same value of these parameters, the results obtained adopting the suggested methods from different standards are not always the same. The aim of this paper is to give an analytical approach to calculate, on a common basis, the failure rate starting from a certain set of input parameters. In addition, the approximations are analysed in order to identify the correct assumptions for the proper application of all these """"not exact"""" values in each application field."""	failure rate	Francesco De Rosa;Raffaello Cesoni;Stefano Genta;Paolo Maggiore	2017	Rel.

90ca24f448d62d5cbf35107c31f7fdca43a02c1e	information flow and analysis: theory, simulation, and experiments. i. basic theoretical and conceptual development	information flow;conceptual development	This series of articles describes research which has been underway at The Ohio State University in an effort to develop a fundamental and general theory of information flow and analysis. More specifically, the research attempts to (1) identify and quantify important variables and parameters in the information flow process; (2) establish relationships among these variables; (3) apply the theory to practical situations and to examine the resulting implications; and (4) develop models, both simulation and experimental, to utilize and validate the theory. The basis for our work treats information as data of value in decision-making. This, in turn, leads to a powerful model of a Generalized Information System. We have now made considerable progress and have developed the basic elements comprising a generalized theory. In particular, we have been able to establish quantitative definitions for and relationships among: quantity of information, value of information, effectiveness of information, decision-maker effectiveness, decision-maker performance, and other terms. By dealing with “average” decision-makers, we establish unique relationships for specific decision situations. Typical relationships and curves are presented in the articles. We describe a flexible, sophisticated simulation model which permits the examination of the interrelationship between information and decision-making for a wide variety of different situations. We present detailed simulation results for two specific examples-a typical farmer and a mathematical example. We describe prototype experiments which place human decision-makers in an interactive decision-making situation. We are able to obtain data on their decisionmaking behavior in the light of our conceptual model.

e42c378a2cdf77c0b01d0f38f9c26590006bef7b	learning to cooperate in the prisoner's dilemma: robustness of predictions of an instance-based learning model	social and behavioral sciences	The dynamics of cooperation in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) interactions are captured by an instance-based learning model that assumes dynamic adjustment of expected outcomes (IBL-PD model). This research presents this model’s predictions across a large number of PD payoff matrices, in the absence of human data. Rapoport and Chammah (1965) test three hypotheses in a large set of PD payoff matrices: (1) as reward of cooperation increases, more cooperation is observed; (2) as the temptation to defect increases, less cooperation is observed; and (3) as punishment for defection increases, more cooperation is observed. We demonstrate that the same IBL-PD model that was found to predict the dynamics of cooperation in one particular payoff matrix of the PD produces accurate predictions of human cooperation behavior in six additional games. We also make detailed predictions of the dynamics of cooperation that support these three hypotheses.	instance-based learning;interaction;prisoner's dilemma;software bug	Cleotilde Gonzalez;Noam Ben-Asher	2014			psychology;artificial intelligence;machine learning;social psychology	AI	-14.363722228729607	-12.107217982352735	184550

The opinions and uncertainties are modified by random pair interactions. We propose a new model of interactions, called relative agreement model, which is a variant of the previously discussed bounded confidence. In this model, uncertainty as well as opinion can be modified by interactions. We introduce extremist agents by attributing a much lower uncertainty (and thus higher persuasion) to a small proportion of agents at the extremes of the opinion distribution. We study the evolution of the opinion distribution submitted to the relative agreement model. Depending upon the choice of parameters, the extremists can have a very local influence or attract the whole population. We propose a qualitative analysis of the convergence process based on a local field notion. The genericity of the observed results is tested on several variants of the bounded confidence model.

afe7e19e72594b773073f3f4254b6909a1db4306	co-evolutionary learning of contextual asymmetric actors		Co-evolutionary learning of the iterated prisoner’s dilemma (IPD) has been used to model and simulate interactions, which may not be realistic due to assumptions of a fixed and symmetric payoff matrix for all players. Recently, we proposed to extend the co-evolutionary learning framework for any two-player repeated encounter game to model more realistic behavioral interactions. One issue we studied is to endow players with individual and self-adaptive payoff matrix to model individual variations in their utility expectations of rewards for making certain decisions. Here, we study a different issue involving contextual asymmetric actors. The differences in the utility expectations (payoff matrix) are due to contextual circumstances (external) such as political roles rather than variations in individual preferences (internal). We emphasize the model of interactions among contextually asymmetric actors through a multi-population structure in the co-evolutionary learning framework where different populations representing different actor roles interact. We study how different actor roles modelled by fixed and asymmetric payoff matrices can have an impact to the outcome of co-evolutionary learning. As an illustration, we apply co-evolutionary learning of two contextually asymmetric actors from the spanish democratic transition.	interaction;interpupillary distance;iteration;population;prisoner's dilemma;simulation	Siang Yew Chong;Christopher Hill;Xin Yao	2009		10.7148/2009-0827-0833	dilemma;iterated function;matrix (mathematics);normal-form game;stochastic game;economics;welfare economics	AI	-14.943485198293947	-13.885171665122773	184837

Because of the delayed health effects, poor reporting, and low levels of awareness in some communities, the extent of the adverse health problems caused by arsenic in drinking water is at alarming level in Bangladesh. Also, allocating resources such as tube wells efficiently and effectively to mitigate arsenic hazard is a challenging task in Bangladesh. To allocate resources based on different arsenic hazard parameters, we have developed a Decision Support System that enables the user to observe the effect of allocation policy both in tabular and spatial format using statistical models. We have also developed an algorithm for optimal allocation of resources. A Smart User Interface is designed for the users so that they will find an interactive, user-friendly, intelligible, logical, clear, and sound environment to work with. Finally, we have analyzed and demonstrated the efficacy of our algorithm graphically.	algorithm;awareness;geographic information system;intelligent decision support system;mathematical optimization;simulation;statistical model;table (information);usability;user interface;vulnerability (computing)	Mohammad M.

On the other hand side, however, they presuppose mutation and selection to be a rather prodigal and unefficient trial-and-error strategy. Taking into account the parallel processing of a heterogeneous population and sexual propagation with recombination as well as the endogenous adaptation of strategy characteristics, simulated evolution reveals a couple of interesting, sometimes surprising, properties of nature's learning-by-doing algorithm. Survival of the fittest, often taken as Darwin's view, turns out to be a bad advice. Individual death, forgetting, and even regression show up to be necessary ingredients of the life game. Whether the process should be named gradualistic or punctualistic, is a matter of the observer's point of view. He even may observe long waves.

Traditional transit OD matrix constructing method needs a large range of spot check survey. It is expensive and needs long cycle time to process information. Recently transit IC card charging systems have been widely applied in big cities. Being processed reasonably, transit passenger information stored in IC card database can turn into information resource. It will reduce survey cost a lot. The concept of transit trip chain is put forward in this paper. According to the characteristics of closed transit trip chain, it discusses how to process IC card information and construct transit OD matrix. It also points out that urban transit information platform and data warehouse should be constructed, and how to integrate IC card information.	smart card	Xiuhua Han;Jin Li;Han Peng	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-75494-9_67	embedded system;engineering;operations management;database	AI	-10.409358154706403	-20.308007954907165	185865

People are facing problems when they approach corrupted offices and are forced to bribe the officials to get their work done. To pacify this situation which is eating up the nation slowly and steadily people are willing to set up a Lokpal, an autonomous agency that will not only heed to the appeal by the citizens when they face or observe corruption in local/regional/national government/public bodies but also check for it and take necessary actions. In context with this necessity, this paper proposes an agent-based simulation tool using neural network and fuzzy to understand under what conditions a simple model of the Lokpal agency will be effective. Certain metrics, various scenarios, working conditions and different environment under the organisation is working has been simulated to evaluate their respective effectiveness.	agent-based model;agent-based social simulation;fuzzy logic;neuro-fuzzy	Praveen Ranjan Srivastava;Saurabh Verma;Shivam Upadhyay	2014	IJBIC	10.1504/IJBIC.2014.062633	fuzzy logic;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;management science;metrics;artificial neural network	AI	-11.403367643427545	-11.905844004001604	186208
b419e05610d8ee20cd057cc7277913ade32d51ae	construction of intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive maps for target marketing strategy decisions		Shopping malls today, are the centers of social life. There exists an increasing demand of shopping malls. The market’s profit margin is promising however from the investor’s perspective, shopping malls require big investments and the risk level is high. For the success of a shopping mall, its target market needs to be chosen carefully in the beginning and its marketing mix needs to be in the same direction. There exist many factors influencing the target market strategy selection of a shopping mall; this process can be observed as an MCDM problem. The purpose of this study is to determine the interrelations between the criteria affecting a shopping mall’s target market differentiation degree, to select a target marketing strategy while considering the hesitations of decision makers and to represent this complex decision making system with intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive maps. Numerical application is made for investment decision making process of a new shopping mall that will locate in Istanbul, Turkey.	cognitive map;in the beginning... was the command line;intuitionistic logic	Elif Dogu;Tuncay Gürbüz;Y.

A product’s NRE design cost is the number of staff-months required to successfully complete its design. This information is essential in determining the human resources needed to meet a project’s timeto-market constraints. For low-complexity development processes that target relatively stable products, relying on experienced managers to produce NRE design cost estimates is reasonable. But microprocessor design and other leading-edge product development processes often involve hundreds of designers, perhaps located at geographically distinct sites, and consist of a formidable number of tasks. These processes require a more systematic way of generating NRE design cost estimates.1-3 To that end, we have developed an NRE design cost estimation model and implemented it in a tool called NREC. NREC assists managers in making a fine-grained estimate of a project’s NRE design costs, from requirements to final layout, as well as in tracking and assessing costs of completed projects. The tool also enables managers to systematically validate and tune the cost model’s parameters according to the particular history of a project’s design environment. NRE cost model basics Estimating the number of staff-months required for designing a new product is not a trivial task, mainly because it involves complex human factors. The subjective nature of these factors makes them virtually impossible to represent in analytical form. An NRE design cost estimation tool thus must rely on a statistical model. Moreover, the model’s parameters must be intuitive to managers, or the tool may fail in its ultimate purpose: effectively assisting risk assessment and planning of new product development processes. To produce a model that is both simple and intuitive, we merged a significant number of design process variables, such as designer expertise, relative task complexity, and available CAD tools, into only two statistically derived parameters: complexity and productivity.4-6 The model also requires a size estimate of objects involved in the design task. The NRE design cost estimate’s accuracy depends on the size factor’s accuracy. To be effective, a tool based on the model must facilitate accurate size estimates and statistically meaningful productivity and complexity factors. NREC computes the NRE cost of a design task, such as the logic design of a multiplier, as the product of the size, complexity, and productivity factors.

Negotiation provides the basis for managing the expectations of the individual negotiating agents, and it enables selecting solutions that satisfy the agents as much as possible. Thus far, most of the negotiation models have limitations when employed in large scale multiagent systems. This paper presents a negotiation model for large scale multiagents systems that is based on qualitative reasoning (QR) and game theory (GT). In the model, each agent classifies its negotiation opponents according to the similarity of their preference model. The agents use QR components of the model to estimate the preference models of their opponents, and to determine the amount of tradeoff associated with the various solution options. Moreover, they use the GT component of the model to determine the social-acceptance of each of the solution options. The output of the QR and GT components of the negotiation model is used to determine the rationale for accepting or rejecting offers made by the opponents	agent-based model;design rationale;game theory;multi-agent system;qr code	Behrouz Homayoun Far;Tom Wanyama;Sidi O.

The success of the learning process depends on the way in which the individuals are engaged in a community. Within the community, individuals are grouped into small clusters according to their homogeneous properties and the diversity within the group. In this work we focus on the formation of groups of individuals. More specifically, we apply genetic algorithms in the formation process in order to deal with the high level of complexity.

3bf32a3b05be13ba3307611fb6ec5a31036d04d0	study on the adaptation with learning about the environment: the case of post-acquisition integration		Organizations can be considered as complex systems that can adapt to their changing environment. In this work, we study a complex system adapting to an unfamiliar environment with learning; this is grounded in the context of the post-acquisition integration of the companies. More specifically, we conceptualize post-acquisition integration from the perspective of behavioral theory as a reason for the environmental changes to the firms (agents). We studied the adaptation of these complex systems and we propose a coupled learning method over the NK landscape. The simulation results show that the initial perceptions of the agents regarding the new task environment can be quite influential to the performance of the entire system during the adaptation process. Correct initial perceptions can help the system to quickly achieve high performance, whereas incorrect initial perceptions may prevent the system from reaching high performance. Lack of initial perceptions could lead to a slow yet robust adaptation process with a moderate level of performance. Moreover, certain other factors, such as the sensitivity to the feedback from the environment, the incentive of the system for exploration, and the learning frequency, may have different impact on the adaptation and performance of the system.

Despite this opportunity, the literature has neglected to offer a structured agent-based modeling approach to produce agents or its parts directly from data. In this paper, we present initial steps towards an agent-based modeling approach that focuses on individual-level data to generate agent behavioral rules and initialize agent attribute values. We present a structured way to integrate Big Data and machine learning techniques at the individual agent-level. We also describe a conceptual use-case study of an urban mobility simulation driven by millions of geo-tagged Twitter social media messages. We believe our approach will advance the-state-of-the-art in developing empirical ABMs and conducting their validation. Further work is needed to assess data suitability, to compare with other approaches, to standardize data collection, and to serve all these features in near-real time.	agent-based model;big data;machine learning	Hamdi Kavak;Jose J.

The Tit for Tat strategy has been identified as a successful strategy which reinforces mutual cooperation, however, it is sensitive to environmental noise which disrupts continued cooperation between players to their detriment. This paper explores whether a population of Tit for Tat players may evolve specialised individual-based noise to counteract environmental noise. We have found that when the individual-based noise acts similarly to forgiveness it can counteract the environmental noise, although excessive forgiveness invites the evolution of exploitative individual-based noise, which is highly detrimental to the population when widespread.	iterated function;prisoner's dilemma	Lachlan Brumley;Kevin B.

In this process, a new model was developed through the combination of a suite of existing methods and tools: geographical information system, Delphi methods and spatial decision support tools: namely multi-criteria evaluation analysis, analytical hierarchy process and ordered weighted average method. The developed model has the potential to calculate land use compatibility in both horizontal and vertical directions. Furthermore, the compatibility between the use of each floor in a building and its neighboring land uses can be evaluated. The method was tested in a built-up urban area located in Tehran, the capital city of Iran. The results show that the model is robust in clarifying different levels of physical compatibility between neighboring land uses. This paper describes the various steps and processes of developing the proposed land use compatibility evaluation model (CEM). # 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.	analytical hierarchy;decision support system;geographic information system	Mohammad Taleai;Ali Sharifi;Richard Sliuzas;Mohammad Saadi Mesgari	2007	Int.

Aiming at this point, potential security dangers of power network information system were analyzed. Then an index system based on the security evaluation of power network information systems was established. Applying the analytic network process to get the weights of each index, the evaluation process can be accessed by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method.

First, we introduce a six-layer framework for simulating the trading system of grid computing resources. Then we analyze a trading case: resource advance reservation through agents participating in multiple sequential auctions. We study the evolution of this trading system using cognitive agents that can automatically adapt to the environment, exchange private information and learn new experiences from their network neighborhoods. We compare the different outcomes of the experiments in non-cooperative and local cooperative perspectives. Finally, after analyzing the experiment results, some critical issues regarding the design of market-based trading system are discussed.	simulation	Zhixing Huang;Yuhui Qiu	2007	Future Generation Comp.

11fe26d1ec88533cfac3a2b8438c9901619d3236	the impact of centrality on cooperative processes	interdisciplinar	The solution of today's complex problems requires the grouping of task forces whose members are usually connected remotely over long physical distances and different time zones. Hence, understanding the effects of imposed communication patterns (i.e., who can communicate with whom) on group performance is important. Here we use an agent-based model to explore the influence of the betweenness centrality of the nodes on the time the group requires to find the global maxima of NK-fitness landscapes. The agents cooperate by broadcasting messages, informing on their fitness to their neighbors, and use this information to copy the more successful agents in their neighborhood. We find that for easy tasks (smooth landscapes), the topology of the communication network has no effect on the performance of the group, and that the more central nodes are the most likely to find the global maximum first. For difficult tasks (rugged landscapes), however, we find a positive correlation between the variance of the betweenness among the network nodes and the group performance. For these tasks, the performances of individual nodes are strongly influenced by the agents' dispositions to cooperate and by the particular realizations of the rugged landscapes.	agent-based model;anatomy, regional;betweenness centrality;communication complexity;distance;maxima and minima;maximum;natural killer cells;performance;reporting;rugged computer;sample variance;telecommunications network;message	Sandro M.

These different rules are distinctive to their own level. Yet, because adjacent levels interact, one level can influence outcomes of another and ideally should be made harmonious, otherwise chaos is likely.

In that purpose, we study various agent behaviors. We show that there exists in each case a simple behavior leading the negotiation process to a socially optimal resource allocation as an emergent phenomenon, or to a socially close solution if the need arises.

The study of effects of the presence of groups in the simulated population is object of growing interest in the community. While previous results have started to investigate the phenomenon, implying conflicting tendencies for pedestrians, mechanisms for the flexible management of cohesion among group members are still investigated both in continuous and discrete modelling efforts. The present effort is aimed at extending previous modelling efforts, preserving and improving the capability to generate overall plausible aggregated dynamics, while at the same time improving the precision in the microscopic group dynamics, with particular attention to the shape of dyads. The paper presents validated results based on empirical data from a controlled experiment, also discussing qualitative results in different common situations (bends and bottlenecks).

We collect our data from 800 real human subjects through a large-scale randomized online experiment. We evaluate the performance of a wide range of computational models in fitting the data by both conducting a scalable search through the space of two-component models (i.e. inference + selection model) and investigating a few rules of thumb. Our results suggest that across different decision-making environment, an average human decision maker can be best described by a two-component model, which is composed of an inference model that relies heavily on more recent information (i.e. displays recency bias) and a selection model which assumes cost-proportional errors and reluctance to change in subsequent trials (i.e. displays status-quo bias). Additionally, while a large portion of individuals behave like the average decision maker, how they differ from each other is greatly influenced by the environment. These results imply the possibility of constructing agents with a single type of model that is robust against the context, and provide insights into adjusting heterogeneity among multiple agents based on the context.	component-based software engineering;computational model;decision theory;intelligent agent;randomized algorithm;scalability;selection bias;semantic heterogeneity;simulation;status quo bias	Ming Yin;Yu-An Sun	2015			behavioral modeling;cognitive bias;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence	AI	-12.74254460816182	-13.264460178107957	188665

These factors are so related that the complex territorial system sometimes seems indecipherable. Thus, as the quantitative modeling suggests, the real phenomenon is simplified, identifying a limited number of exogenous variables and researching the effect that these variables generate on the simplersystem, object of the study. The goal is to find the functional relationships that govern the events. In the present study, the temporal evolution of the built in a metropolitan area is investigated, in order to determine the effect that the age of construction and geographical location have on the market value of the property for residential use. Then, correlations are recorded with both the labor or capital income that the population perceives on the territory, and with the spatial distribution of the unemployment rate. The construction of the reference dataset is conducted on the basis of official information provided in Italy by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and the Property Market Observatory (OMI) of Territorial Agency. Finally, the implementation of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), at the level of Census and OMI units, allows to draw thematic maps, from which comparisonthe results of the study are derived (Both the authors conceived and designed the research and the paper.

Due to the variety of applications of OMVP in communications, surveying, military, urban planning, etc., it is necessary to find a solution. Current solutions include many shortcoming, and disadvantages such as: “not considering the quality of coverage (quality of the received signal)” and “not being applicable because of high number of calculations”. In this paper, a new genetic method has been used to solve OMVP which resolves the mentioned shortcomings, considerably. In this method, each viewpoint is considered as a gene and each N viewpoint compose a chromosome. The quality problem is solved by considering electromagnetic wave attenuation model as the fitness function. The number of calculations has also been considerably reduced by integrated utilization of DEM and TIN, Were TIN vertices are used as the first genes instead of DEM pixels.

Contrary to standard theoretical predictions, but in line with recent empirical findings, we observed that altruistic acts in non-repeated interactions can emerge as a natural consequence of recognition of heritable phenotypic traits such as visual tags, which enable the discrimination between potentially beneficial and unproductive encounters. Moreover, we identified topological regimes in which cooperation always prevails at short times, but where unconditional cooperators are favored over conditional tag-based helpers, even though the latter initially have a slight reproductive advantage. After very long times, we found that all four strategies appeared about equally often, meaning that only one quarter of agents refused cooperation egoistically. However, our study suggests that intra-tag generosity can quickly evolve to dominate over other strategies in spatially structured environments that are otherwise detrimental to cooperative behavior.	complex network	Tarik Hadzibeganovic;F.

Many real applications of GIS need more functions in analysis and decision-making than in data management and visualization. While confronted with an application like planning a new metro line in a city, the typical GIS cannot accomplish it by itself, unless some human experts or artificial intelligence (AI) technology are involved. Many applications of GIS are essentially models for analyzing under different themes, and they are examples of problem solving in AI. Therefore many theories and technologies from AI can be embedded in GIS to strengthen its ability of automatic analysis. Since mathematical programming is a kind of powerful tool to provide feasible if not optimal solutions for problems under some constraint conditions. And many applications of GIS happen to be in a category of optimization, as they can usually be approximated accurately with some mathematical models.

We propose a two-stage bandwidth allocation mechanism based on modified strictly-proper scoring rules, whereby multiple agents can provide track data estimates of limited precisions and the centre does not have to rely on knowledge of the true state of the world when calculating payments. In particular, our work emphasizes the importance of applying robust optimization techniques to deal with the data uncertainty in the operating environment. We apply our robust optimization – based scoring rules mechanism to an agent-based model framework of the tactical defence scenario, and analyse the results obtained.

The CCPSO(t) algorithm is applied to train a team of agents to play simple soccer. The algorithm uses the charged particle swarm optimiser in a competitive and cooperative coevolutionary training environment to train neural network controllers for the players. The CCPSO(t) algorithm makes use of the FIFA league ranking relative fitness function to gather detailed performance metrics from each game played. The training performance and convergence behaviour of the particle swarm is analysed. A hypothesis is presented that explains the lack of convergence in the particle swarms. After applying a clustering algorithm on the particle positions, a detailed visual and quantitative analysis of the player strategies is presented. The final results show that the CCPSO(t) algorithm is capable of evolving complex gameplay strategies for a complex non-deterministic game.

Agents determine for themselves when to initiate cooperation or to assist others, when to rescind commitments, and how to conduct cooperative tasks. For example, an agent may delay the execution of a cooperative task, execute it to a reduced quality, or simply fail to complete it. In this paper, we describe how experience-based trust can be used to minimise the risk associated with cooperation. In particular we propose a mechanism, called multi-dimensional trust, which allows agents to model the trustworthiness of others according to various criteria. This trust information is combined with other factors to enable the selection of cooperative partners. Agents' preferences are represented by a set of factor weightings, which allow trust information to be tailored to the current cooperative priorities. We also describe the experimental validation of our proposed approach.	autonomous agent;autonomous robot;computer multitasking;trust (emotion)	Nathan Griffiths	2005		10.1145/1082473.1082548	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;autonomous agent;trustworthy computing;computer security;cooperation	AI	-17.55820611486514	-10.431294287052555	189073

A review of the current literature offers several ITS investment evaluation methods that provide frameworks for the quantification of risks and benefits. Nevertheless, the traditional selection methods overemphasize quantitative and economic analysis and often neglect to consider qualitative and noneconomic data in the formal selection process. Furthermore, crisp data are fundamentally indispensable in traditional ITS investment selection methods. However, the data in real-world problems are often imprecise or ambiguous. In this article, we propose a novel fuzzy group multi-criteria framework for ITS investment evaluation and selection that takes into consideration (1) the qualitative and quantitative criteria and their respective value judgments; (2) the verbal expressions and linguistic variables for qualitative judgments which lead to ambiguity in the decision process; and (3) imprecise or vague judgments. First, we use fuzzy TOPSIS to calculate the fuzzy risk values with each ITS architecture subsystem. Next, we use fuzzy ROA to calculate the fuzzy real option values of the ITS subsystems. Last, we determine the optimal investment schedule for the ITS subsystems by considering the risk and option values as the coefficients of the objective functions in a group multi-objective decision-making model.	coefficient;resource-oriented architecture;scheduling (computing);systems architecture;vagueness	Faramak Zandi;Madjid Tavana	2011	J.

In particular we exploited an integrated methodology to evaluate computer-based applications and their interactions with the operational environment. Current ATC safety practices, methodologies, guidelines and standards were critically revised, in order to identify how they could be applied to the project under consideration. Thus specific problematic areas for the safety assessment in a pre-operational experimental project are highlighted and, on the basis of theoretical principles, some possible solutions taken into consideration.

However, often the actions taken by a partner are (partially) unobserved or the consequences of individual actions are hard to predict. We show that in a large class of games good strategies can be constructed by conditioning one’s behavior solely on outcomes (ie. one’s past rewards). We call this consequentialist conditional cooperation. We show how to construct such strategies using deep reinforcement learning techniques and demonstrate, both analytically and experimentally, that they are effective in social dilemmas beyond simple matrix games. We also show the limitations of relying purely on consequences and discuss the need for understanding both the consequences of and the intentions behind an action.	experiment;multi-agent system;reinforcement learning	Alexander Peysakhovich;Adam Lerer	2018			artificial intelligence;management science;machine learning;reinforcement learning;computer science;social dilemma;conditioning;perfect information;multi-agent system;incentive	ML	-14.929420604471451	-11.777032340810274	190052

The purpose of this new methodology is to solve some of the drawbacks found in comparative and capitalisation methods, called classical appraisal methods, which cannot deal with contexts where only partial information is available and/or qualitative variables are used. The ANP is a method based on the Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). Previous works have already applied other MCDA techniques to the appraisal context, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), however they have not been able to handle all the complexities of many real world appraisal problems. The ANP provides a more accurate approach for modelling complex environment because it allows the general study of the quantitative and qualitative explanatory variables of the price and the incorporation of feedback and interdependence relationships among variables. The new proposed methodology has been applied to a case study of a farm located in Valencia (Spain) in order to demonstrate its goodness. Both quantitative and qualitative variables, such as the age of the trees, productivity or water quality, have been considered to assess the market value of the farm. Six farms from the same region have been selected as reference assets. The appraisal problem has been solved in three different ways in order to study the influence of each model on the value of the problem farm. In this study it has been proved that the more information is incorporated into the model, the higher accuracy of the solution. From the results of this work we can conclude that the approach proposed stands out as a good alternative to current farmland appraisal approaches, as it has proven to be useful when data are only partially available, qualitative variables are used and influences among the explanatory variables are present.

The distributed agent models that represent the supervisory controllers of autonomous soccer robots are capable of communication, interaction and collaboration. By introducing the multi-agent based control architecture, the soccer robots perform seamless team cooperation to achieve the desired mission during competition. Due to the multi-soccer robot system is a discrete event dynamic system with concurrent and asynchronous characteristics, the distributed agent-oriented Petri net (DAOPN) is selected in this paper to model and control the behaviors of the multi-soccer robot systems. The agent models proposed in this work consist of the coordination model and the skill oriented robot behavior models. Especially, the agent based communication places enable the distributed agent models to be communicated directly. In this manner, the DAOPN based agent models can act as the robot controllers and coordinator to perform run-time controls of the soccer robot team. Therefore, the proposed approach not only resolves problems of the multi-robot coordination, but also provides a feasible way to overcome the complicated mathematical functions or rule bases. Finally, this system is tested using four soccer robots, and the results verify the proposed DAOPN based controller.	agent-based model;autonomous robot;dynamical system;multi-agent system;petri net;seamless3d	Chung-Hsien Kuo;In-Hung Lin	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384774	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;petri net	Robotics	-18.67126083386397	-10.292194340757503	190715

Routing scoring rules bring truthful contribution of information about the task and optimal routing of the task into a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium under common knowledge about the competencies of agents. Relaxing the common knowledge assumption, we address the challenge of routing in situations where each agent’s knowledge about other agents is limited to a local neighborhood. A family of local routing rules isolate in equilibrium routing decisions that depend only on this local knowledge, and are the only routing scoring rules with this property. Simulation results show that local routing rules can promote effective task routing.	computation;network topology;refinement (computing);routing;simulation	Haoqi Zhang;Eric Horvitz;Yiling Chen;David C.

Based on this, we focus on the assessment system reliability of complex electromechanical systems (CEMSs) in a fault-propagation view. First, failure propagation model taking into consideration failure data based on network theory and improved polychromatic sets is proposed for system reliability evaluation. From the node point of view, system effectiveness index is constructed to investigate the variation of efficiency of the holistic network. Subsequently, from the system’s perspective, system reliability measurement is provided and estimated in combination with system effectiveness index and failure propagation models. Finally, the application of proposed method to a bogie system of high-speed train assesses system reliability, and meanwhile, the effectiveness of the proposed method is able to be illustrated.	software propagation	Shuai Lin;Yanhui Wang;Limin Jia	2018	Complexity	10.1155/2018/9502953	machine learning;reliability engineering;artificial intelligence;network theory;mathematics	Logic	-8.226646932375802	-17.243094421973694	191253

Next, different hierarchical approaches are shown to be potentially of value in overcoming the two main difficulties highlighted by the control theoretic paradigm, i.e. dimensionality and the discrete event nature of manufacturing systems. In this context, we examine the literature concerned with both multilevel control as well as multilayer control where the notion of aggregation plays a key role. Next, a mixture of multilevel and multilayer control is used to provide a framework for production planning and scheduling for multiline batch manufacture with application to detergents plants. This framework would appear to be of values also in discrete parts manufacture and this is also highlighted.	automated planning and scheduling;capital asset pricing model;control theory;programming paradigm;scheduling (computing)	Madan G.

In order to reduce the international supply chain operation cost, it is very important for enterprises to invest in the international logistics centers. Although a number of research approaches for solving decision-making problems have been proposed, most of these approaches focused on developing quantitative models for dealing with objective data or qualitative models for dealing with subjective ratings. Few researchers proposed approaches for dealing with both objective data and subjective ratings. Thus, this paper attempts to fill this gap in current literature by establishing an integrated quantitative and qualitative fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making model for dealing with both objective crisp data and subjective fuzzy ratings. Finally, the utilization of the proposed model is demonstrated with a case study on location choices of international distribution centers.

Research into applications of RL in other domains with spatial considerations like environmental planning are still in their nascent stages. In this paper, we introduce a novel combination of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and A3C algorithms on an online simulator of a wildfire, on a pair of forest fires in Northern Alberta (Fort McMurray and Richardson fires) and on historical Saskatchewan fires previously compared by others to a physics-based simulator. We conduct several experiments to predict fire spread for several days before and after the given spatial information of fire spread and ignition points. Our results show that the advancements in Deep RL applications in the gaming world have advantages in spatially spreading real-world problems like forest fires.	monte carlo tree search	Sriram Ganapathi Subramanian;Mark Crowley	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-89656-4_28	machine learning;artificial intelligence;spatial analysis;reinforcement learning;computer science;computational sustainability;monte carlo tree search	AI	-15.187265691160336	-23.888092497319263	191757

The system is aimed at supporting analytical work which must be carried out when there is a risk of an epidemic outbreak. It is meant to provide tools for predicting the size of an epidemic on the basis of the actual data collected during its course. Since sanitary teams try to control the size of the epidemics, such a tool must model also sanitary teams activities. As a result a model for the prediction can be quite complicated in terms of the number of equations it contains. Furthermore, since a model is based on several parameters there must be a tool for finding these parameters on the basis on the actual data corresponding to the epidemic evolution. The paper describes the proposition of such a system. It presents, in some details, the main components of the system. In particular, the environment for building complex models (containing not only the epidemic model but also activities of sanitary teams trying to inhibit the epidemic) is discussed. Then, the module for a model calibration is presented. The module is a part of server for solving optimal control problems and can be accessed via Internet. Finally, this paper shows how optimal control problems can be constructed with the aim of the efficient epidemic management. Some optimal control problems related to that issue are discussed and corresponding numerical results are presented.

One example of this technology is the multiagent system which, from a decentralized supply chain configuration perspective, supports the information sharing processes that any of its node will be able to carry out to support its process in a collaborative manner, for example, the forecasting process. Therefore, this paper presents a novel collaborative forecasting model in supply chain networks by considering a multiagent system modelling approach. The hypothesis presented herein is that by collaborating in the information exchange process, less errors are made in the forecasting process.	agent-based model;decision support system;evolutionary computation;information exchange;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;simulation;supply chain network	Jorge Esteban Hernández Hormazabal;Raul Poler Escoto;Josefa Mula	2009			simulation;knowledge management	AI	-18.354447927354272	-12.322485903836345	192309

In general, due to incomplete information, making a decision carries a risk. Typically, such risks are mitigated through risk management. However, risk is not the only element involved in the decision process. When the decision to be made concerns an interaction between two entities, trust plays an important role. Trust, in such an interaction, is a prediction of one entity’s reliance on the other entity to perform a certain action. In this paper we formulate a trust reference model and take a first step towards a decision model by combining the trust model with an existing risk model. The decision model is illustrated by an example in the e-banking domain.	entity;financial risk modeling;modeling language;online banking;reference model;refinement (computing);risk management	Baptiste Alcalde;Eric Dubois;Sjouke Mauw;Nicolas Mayer;Sasa Radomirovic	2009			decision model;r-cast;reference model;optimal decision;actuarial science;decision support system;risk management;decision analysis;decision field theory;decision engineering;knowledge management;decision tree;decision rule;risk;trustworthy computing;complete information;business decision mapping	AI	-10.973625907487197	-10.957316033245673	192341

This has led to pressures on maintenance operations, particularly for out of sight products. Some authors have suggested applying sensors and the use of diagnostics and prognostics to monitor product performance driven by the generally held belief that diagnosing and/or predicting future failure will lead to higher product availability. In this paper, we show the ability of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) to compare between different product monitoring levels. This capability is then applied to an industrial case to investigate whether or not the higher the monitoring level leads to higher product availability.	physical symbol system;sensor;simulation	Abdullah A.

However it is an issue that has not yet been satisfactorily solved, despite the efforts made by interdisciplinary research communities over the past few years, because of the nature of complexity in deciding how community structures should be recognized. In this paper we propose an approach based on cooperative game theory for community detection in social networks. We regard individuals as players, and regard communities as coalitions formed by players, and model community detection problem as the formation and optimization of coalitions. Furthermore, we define coalition profile for players to indicate coalitions that players joined, the order of a coalition profile is defined as the number of coalitions in a coalition profile, and we introduce a utility function to measure preference of coalition profiles. Accordingly, we propose an algorithm to detect a coalition profile with maximal utility function values. We have implemented the algorithms developed in this study and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.

The Desktop Underwriter (DU) system which was developed as a result of this commitment, is an automated underwriting expert system that applies both heuristics and statistics to the problem. The system supports both the wholesale and retail mortgage environments and is built to reason and underwrite loans with incomplete, unverified and conflicting data.#R##N##R##N#The system generates a credit recommendation based on the loan's conformity to credit standards and an eligibility recommendation based on the loan's conformity to eligibility requirements. DU is already having a major impact on the mortgage industry. The system helps standardize how the Fannie Mae underwriting guidelines are interpreted, reduces discrimination by removing subjective reasoning from the decision process and reduces the cost of manual underwriting for both lenders and Fannie Mae.#R##N##R##N#DU was first released into production in June of 1995 and there have been at least two major releases each year. The system's use and importance both to Fannie Mae and the mortgage industry have been growing steadily. DU is well positioned to lead the way in meeting Fannie Mae's goal of reducing the cost of making a mortgage by $1,000 and reducing the processing time from eight weeks to five days.	expert system	David W.

It is extremely urgent to have a scientific and reasonable evaluation of power system security risk. By analyzing the recent series of large-area-blackout incidents, it can be concluded that the traditional methods for security assessment, including the deterministic stability analysis and probabilistic assessment method, have some shortages. This paper put forward a neoteric thought that power system security risk can be evaluated based on the method of grey clustering analysis, and then this paper use maximum entropy theory to calculate the weight. At last, the conclusion indicated that this method used to evaluate the power system security risk is strongly practical.	cluster analysis	Peng Peng;Sifeng Liu;Chuanmin Mi;Jing Tao	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2016.7844697	database index;entropy;risk management;computer science;data mining;reliability;statistics	EDA	-7.867814297141193	-19.625897718127298	194078

First, the literature review discusses some early seminal and application-oriented papers, presents a classification of problems, and then focuses on a basic definition of combined fleet composition and routing: the fleet size and mix vehicle routing problem. Three basic mathematical formulations from the literature are presented and compared. Further, the literature of extended and related problems is described and categorized. Surveys of application oriented research in road-based and maritime transportation conclude the review. Finally, we contrast the literature with aspects of industrial applications from a critical, but constructive stance. Major issues for future work are suggested.	backdrop cms;categorization;vehicle routing problem	Arild Hoff;Henrik Andersson;Marielle Christiansen;Geir Hasle;Arne Løkketangen	2010	Computers & OR	10.1016/j.cor.2010.03.015	mathematical optimization;computer science;vehicle routing problem;mathematics;operations research	HCI	-16.89180567855189	-22.30592244261942	194219
a102eaadafe9f38dbea780aaa60e9e9d744de0d4	a particle swarm model of organizational adaptation	particle swarm;simulation model	This study introduces the particle swarm metaphor to the domain of organizational adaptation. A simulation model (OrgSwarm) is constructed to examine the impact of strategic inertia, in the presence of errorful assessments of future payoffs to potential strategies, on the adaptation of the strategic fitness of a population of organizations. The results indicate that agent (organization) uncertainty as to the payoffs of potential strategies has the affect of lowering average payoffs obtained by a population of organizations. The results also indicate that a degree of strategic inertia, in the presence of an election mechanism, assists rather than hampers adaptive efforts in static and slowly changing strategic environments.	bit error rate;heuristic;particle swarm optimization;population;simulation;social system	Anthony Brabazon;Arlindo Silva;Tiago Ferra de Sousa;Michael O'Neill;Robin A.

115ddfa874d5cdebadf58c32083a149a7373dea2	comparison of fuzzy-ahp and ahp in a spatial multi-criteria decision making model for urban land-use planning	analytic hierarchy process;multi criteria decision making;faculty of science environment engineering and technology;fuzzy ahp;journal article;australian rivers institute;gis;sensitivity analysis;griffith centre for coastal management;land use and environmental planning;griffith institute for tourism;120504;land use planning	Modern planning theories encourage approaches that consider all stakeholders with a variety of discourse values to avoid political and manipulative decisions. In the last decade, application of quantitative approaches such as multi-criteria decision making techniques in land suitability procedures has increased, which allows handling heterogeneous data. The majority of these applications mainly used decision-making techniques to rank the priority of predefined management options or planning scenarios. The presented study, however, shows how spatial decision-making can be used not only to rank the priority of options and performing scenario analysis, but also to provide insight into the spatial extent of the alternatives. This is particularly helpful in situation where political transitions in regard to urban planning policies leave local decision-makers with considerable room for discretion. To achieve this, the study compares the results of two quantitative techniques (analytical hierarchy procedure (AHP) and Fuzzy AHP) in defining the extent of land-use zones at a large scale urban planning scenario. The presented approach also adds a new dimension to the comparative analysis of applying these techniques in urban planning by considering the scale and purpose of the decision-making. The result demonstrates that in the early stage of the planning process, when identifying development options as a focal point is required, simplified methods can be sufficient. In this situation, selecting more sophisticated techniques will not necessarily generate different outcomes. However, when planning requires identifying the spatial extent of the preferred development area, considering the intersection area suggested by both methods will be ideal. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The high risk of loss in these domains is a challenge to team management. Teams must be able to recruit the help of other robots in the environment, while balancing searching with performing immediately useful work.

In this chapter, we address the important characteristics that constituent organizations of supply chains should possess in order to achieve the social, economic and environmental objectives of sustainability. These characteristics (criteria) are obtained using Affinity Diagram. Then, a committee of decision makers is formed to provide linguistic ratings to the candidate organizations (alternatives) against the selected criteria. The linguistic ratings are then transformed into fuzzy numbers and subject to multicriteria decision making technique called VIKOR for sustainability assessment of organizations. A numerical illustration is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.		Anjali Awasthi;Katarzyna Grzybowska;M. Hussain;Satyaveer Singh Chauhan;S. K.

This study describes a causal knowledge-based expert system. ? This study describes FCM for planning an Internet-based stock trading system. ? The case base consists of the qualities of ISTS use, ISTS use, and user satisfaction. ? This study uses structural equation modeling to estimate the relevant relationships. ? This study develops rules for the identification of the qualities for performance. This study describes a causal knowledge-based expert system for planning an Internet-based stock trading system, abbreviated CAKES-ISTS. The case base of this system consists of the qualities that promote ISTS use, two specific facets of ISTS use (stock amount purchased and frequency of use), and user satisfaction. Planning ISTS requires consideration of the complex causal relationships between system qualities, system use, and performance (i.e., user satisfaction). This study also examines the factors affecting the level of system usage and performance. First, this study uses a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) to develop the causal knowledge base of the expert system for ISTS planning. Second, this study uses structural equation modeling to estimate the relevant relationships among FCM components as well as their direction and strength. Third, this study develops rules based on system qualities to predict the usage and performance level of ISTS, allowing the identification of the qualities essential to enhance system usage and performance. This clearly shows how effective ISTS planning is possible through the inference process provided by CAKES-ISTS.	algorithmic trading;causal filter;electronic trading;expert system	Kun Chang Lee;Sangjae Lee	2012	Expert Syst.

2e1f501a2c120430e606f2a891be30d16ac5d436	the use of ahp in security policy decision making: an open office calc application	analytic hierarchy process	In this paper, we introduce a framework to guide decision makers evaluating information security policy performance. It is motivated by lack of adequate decision making mechanism with broader scopes and easy to use for the decision makers. The framework, which adopts Analytic hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology, is developed into a four level hierarchy (goal, criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives) representing different aspects of information security policy. A survey based on AHP methodology was conducted to obtain decision maker preferences. Instead of relying on dedicated AHP software, we prefer to clearly demonstrate the process of AHP calculations by using Open Office Calc in data analysis. The aims are to show the applicability of open source software in handling AHP decision making problem and to help decision makers in understanding AHP data analysis procedures without relying on proprietary software. Results show that decision makers prefer availability of information security as highest priority, followed by confidentiality and integrity. The findings reflect future strategy in order to improve the effectiveness of information security policy in the organization.	confidentiality;information security;libreoffice calc;open-source software	Irfan Syamsuddin;Junseok Hwang	2010	JSW		analytic hierarchy process;decision analysis;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;data mining;computer security	Security	-6.872285332116492	-17.760667665224062	195485

Forgiveness plays an important role to maintain healthy online relationships, which is the central constituent of social dynamics, from cooperation to social cohesion. While most prior studies have focused on analyzing forgiveness factors in offline settings using statistical methods, this study offers a new perspective using a two-staged approach whereby a research model was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM), and then the results were used as inputs for artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy logic (FL) models. An agent-based simulation was then performed to shed light on a possible use of the implemented models. Combining ANN and FL provided more accurate prediction results. In addition, simulation experiments call attention to the potential benefits of forgiveness in maintaining connectedness in a social network. The main purpose of this investiga...

However, these models such as mathematical models have some weaknesses when trying to simulate the influence of geographic features on the disease spread. In this context, we developed a new theoretical model called MASTIM to remedy some shortcomings of current methods. Our model is used to specify the spatio-temporal interactions of various kinds of actors (e.g. mosquitoes, ticks, birds, mammals, etc.) involved in the zoonosis propagation. We applied our model to the case of WNV and the case of Lyme disease in order to illustrate its genericity. Besides, we are currently using our model to develop Zoonosis-MAGS, a generic geosimulation tool for zoonoses. This tool aims at helping health policy makers to better understand the spread of zoonoses and the consequences of their interventions.	generic programming;interaction;lyme (software bundle);mathematical model;simulation;software propagation;theory;unit propagation	Mondher Bouden;Bernard Moulin	2012			biology;environmental engineering;virology;communication	AI	-17.425390031801804	-22.994082592917767	196365

The complexities of such a system as well as the appropriate actions that have to be taken into consideration by the developers are analysed in detail. CREAM methodology has been selected among the most known and used methods for Human Reliability Analysis not only for being well-structured and precise, but also because it fits better in the general structure of the fuzzy logic. The first results from the application of the model are very promising and in accordance with CREAM. The numerical values produced by the model can be further used in the ‘classical’ risk assessment methods, such as event trees and fault trees, in order to calculate the overall occurrence frequency of a particular hazardous event. This is a pilot application that demonstrates the successful ‘translation’ of CREAM into a fuzzy logic model. However, the same model could be extended to cover also other industrial fields, like aviation technology and maritime transports.	human reliability;reliability engineering	Myrto Konstandinidou;Zoe Nivolianitou;Chris T.

Cultural tourism allows destinations and regions to expand their customer base, diversify their offer, extend the stay of the tourist, and reduce seasonality. Great efforts are made, by national governments and regions, in order to obtain official designation regarding the relevance of their historical/cultural attractions, for example through UNESCO’s World Heritage Sites (WHS) list. Such an aspect seems particularly relevant for a country like Italy, which has a high number of entries in the WHS list, and where regions take an active role in promoting tourism. Using an 11-year panel of domestic tourism flows, we investigate the importance of the regional endowment in terms of WHS from two perspectives: (a) by separately estimating the effects, on tourism flows, of WHS located in the residence region of tourists and in the destination region; and (b) by taking into account potential spatial substitution/complementarity effects between regions due to their WHS endowment. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is offered to evaluate the spatial extent of the latter.	akaike information criterion;backward chaining;complementarity theory;emoticon;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;negative feedback;numerical analysis;observable;relevance;seasonality;spatial scale;the daily telegraph;windows home server	Roberto Patuelli;Maurizio Mussoni;Guido Candela	2013	Journal of Geographical Systems	10.1007/s10109-013-0184-5	tourism geography;geography;mathematics;sensitivity analysis;seasonality;statistics	DB	-11.827228022705691	-18.177341143452004	196654

Each voter observes the ballots of her neighbors in the network, from which she infers the likely outcome of the election. Each voter may then revise her vote strategically, to maximize her expected utility. Our work focuses on plurality voting, where strategic voting is a major concern. We show that in practice, strategization increases with voter knowledge, yet can improve the social welfare for the population. Real world social networks exhibit a property called homophily; sometimes called “The Echo Chamber Effect”, which is the tendency for friends to have similar ideologies. We find that homophily dampens the benefits of strategization, and correspondingly, lowers the frequency of its occurrence. This effect may contribute to the low number of strategic voters observed in real world elections. Additionally, strategization may lead to the elimination of less popular candidates, as voters revise their votes to less preferred but more hopeful candidates. This phenomenon is known as Duverger’s Law in political science, and we show that it does not hold in certain network structures.	converge;data structure;embedded system;expect;expected utility hypothesis;network homophily;numerical stability;simulation;social network;voter model	Alan Tsang;Kate Larson	2016			bullet voting;social choice theory;computer science;artificial intelligence;social simulation;cardinal voting systems;emergence	AI	-15.301275253648013	-15.094950764850566	196680
45a7eef13fab52090d0ef32adefadb4f0ee24e03	human-ai learning performance in multi-armed bandits		People frequently face challenging decision-making problems in which outcomes are uncertain or unknown. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms exist that can outperform humans at learning such tasks. Thus, there is an opportunity for AI agents to assist people in learning these tasks more effectively. In this work, we use a multi-armed bandit as a controlled setting in which to explore this direction. We pair humans with a selection of agents and observe how well each human-agent team performs. We find that team performance can beat both human and agent performance in isolation. Interestingly, we also find that an agent's performance in isolation does not necessarily correlate with the human-agent team's performance. A drop in agent performance can lead to a disproportionately large drop in team performance, or in some settings can even improve team performance. Pairing a human with an agent that performs slightly better than them can make them perform much better, while pairing them with an agent that performs the same can make them them perform much worse. Further, our results suggest that people have different exploration strategies and might perform better with agents that match their strategy. Overall, optimizing human-agent team performance requires going beyond optimizing agent performance, to understanding how the agent's suggestions will influence human decision-making.

The game theoretic basis for our experiment is the model of Bramoullé and Kranton (2007). In particular, we are interested in disentangling the influence of global, local and individual factors. We study subjects’ strategic investment decisions in four basic network structures. As predicted, we find that global factors, such as the regularity of the network structure, influence behavior. However, we also find evidence that individual play in networks is to some extent boundedly rational, in the sense that coordination is influenced by local and individual factors, such as the number of (direct) neighbors, local clustering and individuals’ risk attitudes.	cluster analysis;clustering coefficient;theory	Stephanie Rosenkranz;Utz Weitzel	2012	Games and Economic Behavior	10.1016/j.geb.2012.02.003	strategic complements;risk aversion;experimental analysis of behavior;social network	ML	-14.049377456099698	-15.380688433602671	196881

In these –safety and security- emergency situations it is important for citizens to know how to handle. Preparation of citizens in the use of appropriate self-rescue measures can save many lives. Examples of self-rescue measures are: (automatic) alert with either limited or extensive evacuation instructions, dynamic signposting or instructions for the best direction of flight. The questions to be answered are: (1) What is the effect of these measures on the selfrescue in various emergencies? And (2) what is the effect of structural measures on buildings such as heat resistant glass or a more solid construction and (3) how do specific safety measures relate to other measures? This paper describes the first developments of a model for determining and comparing the effect of safety measures for self-rescue in various types of emergency situations.

Because of imprecise and uncertain product requirements, firm accountants have to make their best effort at this stage. Determining the most critical criteria for commodity acquisition process is a vital means for a firm to balance its limited budget. Therefore, firms have used different methods to cope with this time-consuming and mentally intensive process. This study develops a fuzzy analytic network process model which may help firm accountants in this process. Results derived from a data sample are presented to exemplify the established model. Briefly, this paper proposes an intelligent approach to vendor selection through a fuzzy ANP which takes into consideration quantitative and qualitative elements in evaluating vendor alternatives. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Our techniques are applicable to technical analysis, portfolio theory, and nonlinear market modela.

We also present novel applications d multispectral compression techniques to portfolio theory, correlation of similar stocks, effects of interest rates, transaction costs and taxes. 1 Stock market models In this paper we address the applicability of modern data compression techniques for predicting future behavior of stock markets. Motivated by stock market theory, we find that most compression techniques are well suited for successful prediction. We introduce different narket models and present compression techniques that work well under these models. A stock market provides a framework for investors to allocate funds into stocks, and to try to make profits by buying """"under valued"""" stocks and selling """"over valued"""" stocks. Stock markets are one of the most complex and rewarding systems to model accurately. Since their incorporation in the latter part of the last century, there have been a vast number of different techniques to predict their future behavior. Based on the market models we present in this section, we introduce several data compression based techniques for their prediction. We first present definitions of classical views 4f the markets, namely, the technical and the quantitative in Sections 1.1 and 1.2, respectively. In Section 1.3 we introduce a modern market model that admits non-efficiency. We analyze the applicability of data compression techniques under these different models. Lastly, in Section 1.4, we introduce the portfolio theory and implications thereof to data compression algorithms. 1.1 Stock market prices, as most other economic time series, have been modeled by examining how new information impacts the prices, and how much these prices reflect the true value of the underlying security. The most common market prediction techniques can be divided into two main categories: technical and quantitative. The technical view of the markets is that the prices are driven by investor sentiment and that the underlying sequence of prices can be captured and predicted well using data charting techniques [31, 301. This method studies the action of the market as a dynamical entity, rather than studying the actual goods in which the market Technical analysis of stock markets 'Azhar is with Computer Science Dept., North Carolina A& T State University, Greensboro. .UI others are with Department of Computer Sdence, Duke University, Durham, NC.

It is usually understood as an instantaneous change of knowledge states. In our research we consider integration as a process and study its different elements. Here we focus on using asynchronous communication between agents in a decentralized system. We add a structure of preferred connections and simulate different types of groups. We show that this approach works similar to the classical centralized one, while removing the need for a single critical agent. We also use this approach in a prototype of a weather prediction system to show that the results are similar to obtained with other modes of agent communication.	agent-based model;centralized computing;decentralised system;knowledge integration;multi-agent system;prototype;simulation	Marcin Maleszka	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2016.7844708	simulation;cybernetics;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;asynchronous communication;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing;computational model;statistics	Robotics	-18.459497892092063	-12.4132958476358	198060
291861eeb40aeee742f76b8cf4c4cd6dc1216ace	evolving a follower in the presence of a potential leader		In many real-world tasks, the ability to use a group of autonomous agents provides significant benefits over a single agent. However, these benefits come at the cost of greater complexity, particularly in the areas of cooperation and coordination. While many approaches address this problem, of particular interest is the use of leaders that emerge through action, and not group deliberation. Other agents follow these “emergent leaders” through the use of environmental cues, rather than explicit communication. While there have been many observations of emergent leadership both in natural and artificial systems, there is a lack of understanding into how this behavior can be reproduced and fostered in artificial systems. In the work presented here, experiments inspired by studies of natural systems were performed to evaluate the ease with which following behaviors could be evolved. Agent controllers were evolved both in isolation and in the presence of a potential leader. Results show that the controllers evolved in the presence of a potential leader exhibited following behaviors when there was an evolutionary advantage and did not incur a fitness penalty when doing so. In fact, agents that followed a leader agent were able to achieve higher fitness than agents acting alone in comparable situations.	artificial intelligence;artificial life;autonomous agent;autonomous robot;complexity;emergence;experiment;image noise;sql;simulation;software agent	Brent E.

2a1382a88eece3407a8737e385ca4c21cc58f705	solving multi-criteria supplier segmentation based on the modified fahp for supply chain management: a case study		The multi-criteria supplier segmentation (MSS) has become one of the most important problems and plays a key role in every global company. It is vital for every company to successfully select suppliers, to undertake selection evaluation process for a long time, and to invest enormous of capital and effort to manage supply chain efficiently. This study aims to propose a new fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) method for the efficiency evaluation of suppliers with bell-shaped membership functions. Since the MSS is a multi-criteria decision-making problem, we decomposed the problem into two main clusters grouping criteria, including the criterion of capability and the criterion of willingness in the first phase. Then the modified FAHP method is applied to acquire a ranking of the candidate suppliers in the second phase with evaluation of different alternatives. A study from the case company was conducted to choose the best solution alternative(s) for the case company. From the experiments, we show that the proposed method is a very practical and efficient technique for the decision makers to select best options for the MSS in managing supply chain.

To evaluate the enterprise strategic management performance (ESMP) scientifically and accurately, this paper overcomes the shortcoming of tradition linear ESMP evaluation method, proposes a evaluation method which unifies the improved BP neural network (BPNN) algorithm and the multistage dynamic fuzzy judgment (MDFJ), takes the multistage dynamic fuzzy judgment as the sampling foundation, uses the BP neural network principle to establish evaluation model. This method not only can exert the unique advantages of BP neural network, but also overcome the difficulty of seeking the high grade training sample data.

Such applications consist of dichotomous decisions or judgments that are implemented through conjunction of selected criteria. Initially, this paper introduces a model that designates a single decision rule which employs a single binary conjunction operation. This model is extended to handle multiple, related decision rules that consist of any number of binary conjunction operations. Finally, application of the extended model is illustrated through the example of an online hotel reservation database. This example demonstrates how the new model can be utilized for ranking and quantifying the damage that errors in different database attributes inflict. Numerical estimates of the model can be integrated into cost-benefit analyses that assess alternative data accuracy enhancements or process or system designs.	database;information quality;propagation of uncertainty;software propagation	Irit Askira Gelman	2008			management science;quality management;computer science;data mining;propagation of uncertainty;satisficing	DB	-4.7428097009248	-17.40782707773853	199467

Achiev ing coordinat ion in such a system is non t r i v ia l , hut is essential in most appl icat ions, where disjointed or incoherent behavior would be undesirable. Coord ina t ion in decentralized systems is a richer phenomenon than previously believed. In par t icu lar , five ma jor a t t r ibutes are crucial : the extent of the local knowledge and choices of the member agents, the extent of their shared knowledge, the level of their iner t ia , and the level of precision of the required coord inat ion. Interestingly, precision and iner t ia tu rn out to cont ro l the coordinat ion process. They define different regions w i t h i n each of which the other a t t r ibutes relate nicely w i t h coord inat ion, but among which their relat ionships are altered or even reversed. Based on our study, we propose simple design rules to obta in coordinated behavior in decentralized mul t iagent systems. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Coord ina t ion is key to the design of mul t iagent systems. Of ten, the mul t iagent systems must be decentralized whose member agents act autonomously based on local i n fo rma t ion . Such systems are essential in a number of appl icat ions where the agents may not wish to or be able to communicate or have a common p lan. Coord inat ion has been studied before. In the context of d is t r ibuted problem-solv ing and generalized par t ia l p lann ing, many good results have been obta ined [Decker and Lesser, 1995; Durfee, 1999]. However, the key features of decentralized systems and their relat ionship to coord inat ion have not yet been fu l ly explored. Thei r study is the theme of this paper. Let 's begin w i t h a br ief h istor ical overview. The early work on coord inat ion considered knowledge as a key factor. A l though decentralized systems of the k ind we study *Supported by the NCSU College of Engineering, the National Science Foundation under grant IIS-9624425 (Career Award), and IBM corporation. were not always considered, the commun i t y ' s folk lore is that more knowledge leads to better coord inat ion. I t is also recognized that the local ly best actions would not always lead to the best payoff for an ind iv idua l agent much less for the system as a whole. Schaerf et ai consider mul t iagent reinforcement learning in the context of load balancing in d is t r ibuted systems [1995]. In their f ramework, the agents share a number of resources, which they autonomously select to use. When al l agents are noncooperat ive, e.g., by always selecting their most preferred resources, they all stand to lose. However, when ind iv iduals sometimes select, the less desirable resources, the entire popu la t ion benefits. In this system, communica t ion may not be useful in i m prov ing the performance of the popu la t ion and may in fact be de t r imenta l . In a simpler f ramework, Sen el ai also study coordinat ion among agents shar ing resources [1996]. Coord i nat ion corresponds to achieving equ i l i b r i um. Sen et ai argue tha t , contrary to conventional w isdom, g iv ing the interact ing agents add i t iona l knowledge causes the coord ina t ion to slow down. Bar ay uses the same f ramework, but applies genetic a lgor i thms to show how coordinat ion can be speeded up [1998]. Rustogi fr Singh study coord inat ion in a s imi lar f ramework [1999]. They show tha t in add i t ion to knowledge, the choices available and the extent of the knowledge shared by the agents are also impo r tan t . Rustogi & Singh show that coord inat ion slows down when the available choices increase. When shared knowledge increases, then too coord inat ion slows down. There is no direct contradic t ion w i t h Sen et al, because their results correspond to the case where the agents' knowledge also increases. The present paper advances the above program of research by br ing ing in add i t iona l features of decentralized systems in order to better characterize the outcome of coord ina t ion . Our exper iments indicate tha t perfect coord inat ion is often inord inate ly more t ime-consuming than s l ight ly imperfect coord inat ion . Usually, i f the agents exh ib i t higher patience or iner t ia in terms of not j u m p i n g to another resource, they can coordinate faster.	execution unit;international components for unicode;linear algebra;load balancing (computing);mike lesser;network address translation;os-tan;reinforcement learning;unified model;ical	Sudhir K.

Based on this framework, we analyse the competition between two markets in detail. Specifically, we game-theoretically analyse the equilibrium behaviour of traders’ market selection strategies and adopt evolutionary game theory to investigate how traders dynamically change their strategies, and thus, which equilibrium, if any, can be reached. In so doing, we show that it is unlikely for these competing markets to coexist. Eventually, all traders will always converge to locating themselves at one of the markets. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that sometimes all traders converge to the market that charges higher fees. Thus we further analyse this phenomenon, and specifically determine the factors that affect such migration.	coexist (image);converge;evolutionary governance theory;game theory;goto;traders;vendor lock-in	Bing Shi;Enrico Gerding;Perukrishnen Vytelingum;Nicholas R.

An interbank payment system (IPS) is defined as the set of rules, institutions and technical mechanisms by which the transfer of funds between banks is carried out. Traditional models of IPS assume complete awareness of the economic agents of their environment, which may not be the case in real life scenarios with different sources of uncertainty. To overcome this drawback, in this chapter a novel framework to modeling an interbank net settlement payment systems (NSPS) and analyze the effect of the individual actions of the economic-agents in the context of the Collective Intelligence (COIN) theory is proposed. Based on Soft-computing techniques, this framework is focused on the interactions at the local and the global levels among the consumer-agents (without global knowledge of the environment model) in order to optimize a global utility function (GUF). A COIN is defined as a large Multiagent System (MAS) with no centralized control and communication, but where there is a global task to complete. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are used at the local level, while mechanisms inspired from the COIN theory are used to optimize global behavior. The proposed framework was implemented using Netlogo (agent-based parallel modeling and simulation environment). The results demonstrated that the interbank NSPS is a good experimental field for the application of the COIN theory and showed how the consumer-agents adapt their behavior converging to the efficient Nash equilibrium, thereby optimizing the GUF.	agent-based model;collective intelligence;multi-agent system	Luis E.

f880762ca2a9fe0891c3b30cde8f9e2bd97ef77d	bio-inspired evolutionary game dynamics in symmetric and asymmetric models		A large population of players has to reach consensus in a distributed way between two options. The two options can be equally favorable or one option can have a higher intrinsic value (asymmetric parameters). In both cases, uncommitted players choose one of the two options depending on the popularity of that option, while committed players can be attracted by those committed to the other option via cross-inhibitory signals. We illustrate the model in different application domains including honeybee swarms, duopolistic competition and opinion dynamics. The main contributions of this letter are as follows: 1) we develop an evolutionary game model to explain the behavioral traits of the honeybees where this model originates; 2) we study individuals’ and collective behavior including conditions for local asymptotic stability of the equilibria; 3) we study thresholds on the cross-inhibitory signal for the symmetric case and for the corresponding model with heterogeneous connectivity in the case of asymmetric structure with asymmetric parameters; and 4) we study conditions for stability and passivity properties for the collective system under time-varying and uncertain cross-inhibitory parameter in the asymmetric structure and parameters.	swarm intelligence	Leonardo Stella;Dario Bauso	2018	IEEE Control Systems Letters	10.1109/LCSYS.2018.2838445	instrumental and intrinsic value;mathematical economics;game theory;collective behavior;social network;multi-agent system;popularity;population;exponential stability	Theory	-14.48786481708734	-16.152133877221495	199693
0646f550fcd830869857b26bb58b7225cad9d3f6	a general framework for interacting bayes-optimally with self-interested agents using arbitrary parametric model and model prior	multi agent reinforcement learning;reinforcement learning;multi agent systems	Recent advances in Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) have shown that Bayes-optimality is theoretically achievable by modeling the environment’s latent dynamics using Flat-DirichletMultinomial (FDM) prior. In self-interested multiagent environments, the transition dynamics are mainly controlled by the other agent’s stochastic behavior for which FDM’s independence and modeling assumptions do not hold. As a result, FDM does not allow the other agent’s behavior to be generalized across different states nor specified using prior domain knowledge. To overcome these practical limitations of FDM, we propose a generalization of BRL to integrate the general class of parametric models and model priors, thus allowing practitioners’ domain knowledge to be exploited to produce a fine-grained and compact representation of the other agent’s behavior. Empirical evaluation shows that our approach outperforms existing multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms.	agent-based model;algorithm;experiment;finite difference method;machine learning;multi-agent system;parametric model;reinforcement learning	Trong Nghia Hoang;Kian Hsiang Low	2013			simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;reinforcement learning	AI	-13.007664066065974	-10.511453324030203	199779
