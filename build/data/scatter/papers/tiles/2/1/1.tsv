It is shown that the stacked antennas are inherently broadband which is explored by investigating the behavior of the currents on the patch and compare the results of different configurations. Parameters such as substrate thickness, slot length and width are also investigated and design results from parametric simulations are presented. An experimental study confirms the simulation studies. A maximum impedance bandwidth of 60.2% could be achieved using this stacked configuration with a modified half-E shape radiating patch.	microstrip	Mohammad Abdul Matin;Bayan S.

However, design effort for FPGA implementations remains high — often an order of magnitude larger than design effort using high level languages. Instead of this time-consuming process, high level synthesis (HLS) tools generate hardware implementations from high level languages (HLL) such as C/C++/SystemC. Such tools reduce design effort: high level descriptions are more compact and less error prone. HLS tools promise hardware development abstracted from software designer knowledge of the implementation platform. In this paper, we examine several implementations of stereo matching, an active area of computer vision research that uses techniques also common for image de-noising, image retrieval, feature matching and face recognition. We present an unbiased evaluation of the suitability of using HLS for typical stereo matching software, usability and productivity of AutoPilot (a state of the art HLS tool), and the performance of designs produced by AutoPilot. Based on our study, we provide guidelines for software design, limitations of mapping general purpose software to hardware using HLS, and future directions for HLS tool development. For the stereo matching algorithms, we demonstrate between 3.5X and 67.9X speedup over software (but less than achievable by manual RTL design) with a five-fold reduction in design effort vs. manual hardware design.	algorithm;autopilot;cognitive dimensions of notations;computation;computer stereo vision;computer vision;facial recognition system;field-programmable gate array;high-level programming language;high-level synthesis;image retrieval;noise reduction;requirement;software design;speedup;usability	Kyle Rupnow;Yun Liang;Yinan Li;Dongbo Min;Minh N.

1a79819eb58508ecc2c6827e4941d087c2a896e9	write-energy-saving reram-based nonvolatile sram with redundant bit-write-aware controller for last-level caches		Nonvolatile static random-access memory (NV-SRAM) is a crucial component type for normally-off computing systems. This work proposes a novel 10T2R resistive random-access memory (ReRAM)-based NV-SRAM controller that is aware of redundant bit writes and considers the conditions of redundant bit writes. When data stored in SRAM cells are the same as the data in ReRAM devices, backup can be skipped. Otherwise, backup is performed. As a result, redundant bit-write conditions indicate that energy can be saved when backing up data. Simulations show that as much as 93% of typical energy requirements can be saved when the high resistive state is larger than 10 MΩ. As long as the probability of redundant bit writes is larger than 25%, backup energy saving can be achieved. The ReRAM chip is manufactured with 90 nm CMOS technology and the ReRAM process of the Industrial Technology Research Institute. This design can be applied to L2 and L3 caches.	backup;cmos;computer simulation;copy-on-write;emergency power system;nv network;random access;requirement;resistive random-access memory;static random-access memory	Tsai-Kan Chien;Lih-Yih Chiou;Yi-Sung Tsou;Shyh-Shyuan Sheu;Pei-Hua Wang;Ming-Jinn Tsai;Chih-I Wu	2017	2017 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED)	10.1109/ISLPED.2017.8009153	electronic engineering;computer science;control theory;static random-access memory;chip;computer hardware;non-volatile memory;backup;resistive random-access memory;resistive touchscreen;cmos	Arch	17.930796817086907	59.89804182438807	1007

Both for uplink and downlink, concrete algorithms have been proposed, and strong increases in spectral efficiency and system fairness have been predicted. Besides posing strong requirements towards the time and frequency synchronization of communicating entities, one essential problem connected to multi-cell cooperative signal processing is the large extent of backhaul required between base stations and an increased detection latency. In this paper, we focus on the latter two aspects in the context of a cellular uplink. We consider different schemes of multi-cell cooperative detection and introduce a framework that allows to derive general backhaul- or latency-constrained rate regions for multi-cell multiple access channels (MAC).	algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);entity;fairness measure;interference (communication);interrupt latency;requirement;signal processing;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Patrick Marsch;Gerhard P.

a1bc394c3eb09885c46cdeb8b5fbefe264205bed	hinetsim: a parallel simulator for large-scale hierarchical direct networks		As the scale of high performance computer keeps increasing, the hierarchical high dimension direct network, such as Cray Dragonfly and K computer 6D mesh, becomes commonly used. In such architecture, the variety of topologies in each hierarchy leads to the complexity of topology and routing algorithm. Facing to the high complexity and scalability, parallel network simulator is the suitable platform to design network architecture efficiently and study its performance. We design and implement a packet-level parallel network simulator HiNetSim which can achieve both high accuracy and efficiency. In addition, the simulator provides flexible interfaces and configuration files for establishing hierarchical topologies and implementing routing algorithms. As a demonstration of HiNetSim, studies on flattened butterfly, 4D Torus and a proposed hierarchical network are given. Evaluation shows that HiNetSim achieves linear parallel speedup and is capable of simulating the network with tens of thousands nodes.

Our algorithm, which is an improvement to the EG elimination method [2], uses only elementary linear algebra operations (ranks, kernels and determinants) to produce an equation satisfied by the degrees of the solutions with finite support. As a consequence, we can bound and compute the polynomial and rational solutions of very general linear functional systems such as systems of differential or (q—) difference equations.	algorithm;eurographics;gaussian elimination;linear algebra;linear system;polynomial;recurrence relation	Sergei A.

Since reset is typically not timing critical, it is handled at late physical design stages. However, the large fanout of reset and the lack of routing resources at these stages can create variant delays on different targets of the reset signal, creating reset recovery problems. Traditional approaches address this problem using physical design methods such as buffer insertion or rerouting. However, these methods may invalidate previous optimization efforts, making timing closure difficult. In this work we propose a formal method to calculate reset recovery slacks for registers at the register transfer level. Designers and physical design tools can then utilize this information throughout the design flow to reduce reset problems at later design stages.	fan-out;formal methods;mathematical optimization;physical design (electronics);register-transfer level;reset button;routing;slack variable;timing closure	Chih-Neng Chung;Chia-Wei Chang;Kai-Hui Chang;Sy-Yen Kuo	2011	2011 Design, Automation & Test in Europe	10.1109/DATE.2011.5763286	algorithm design;electronic engineering;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;boolean function;reset vector;algorithm	EDA	18.197495848200834	50.92697670069056	1021
2fcda9fc123e840bd6403006413a9fc798353c27	a two-dimensional phase coding for range ambiguity suppression		Abstract Based on a two-dimensional phase coding, a novel range ambiguity suppression technique is proposed in this paper. By transmitting two-dimensional phase coded signals, the two-dimensional spectrum of the range ambiguous signals will be shifted along both range and azimuth directions compared with that of desired signals. Then, part of the two-dimensional spectrum of the range ambiguous signals will be located outside the two-dimensional spectral support, which is known in priori, of the desired signals. Considering the range frequency and Doppler oversamplings, a filter corresponding to the two-dimensional spectral support of the desired signals is applied, which suppresses the range ambiguity. Simulation results of both point targets and distributed targets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	zero suppression	Guangcai Sun;Xiang-Gen Xia;Liang Guo;Guo-Bin Jing;Meng-dao Xing;Zheng Bao	2018	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2018.07.008	artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;mathematics;coding (social sciences);ambiguity;doppler effect;control theory;azimuth	Crypto	56.47926934191404	74.97648589933802	1022

The performance of JD crucially depends on the treatment of the so-called correction equation, in particular the preconditioner, and the initial vector. Depending on the choice of the spectral shift and the accuracy of the solution, the convergence of JD can vary from linear to cubic. We investigate parallel preconditioners for the Krylov space method used to solve the correction equation.  We apply our nonlinear Jacobi–Davidson (NLJD) method to quadratic eigenvalue problems that originate from the time-harmonic Maxwell equation for the modeling and simulation of resonating electromagnetic structures.	algorithm;jacobi method	Yoichi Matsuo;Hua Guo;Peter Arbenz	2014		10.1016/j.procs.2014.05.051	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics	Robotics	91.5837320481741	9.099632796392434	1032

In this paper, a new approach using fuzzy logic is introduced to combine SPT, CR priority rules, and next machine's load (NML) rate the job to be processed next in order to satisfy not only a single objective but also all objectives. Fuzzy logic calculates priority value by considering SPT, CR, and NML. We named this priority rule as fuzzy priority rule (FPR). The job with the highest priority value is assigned to machine to be processed. To compare FPR with other priority rules such as SPT, EDD, etc. we run simulation. The results indicate significant improvements on mean flow time, mean tardiness, work in process (WIP), and throughput simultaneously.	job shop scheduling;scheduling (computing)	Yavuz Burak Canbolat;Emin Gundogar	2004	J.

The ODEs are formulated as optimization problem. Some basic fundamentals from different areas of mathematics are coupled with each other to effectively cope with the propounded problem. The Fourier series expansion, calculus of variation, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are employed in the formulation of the problem. Both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value problems (IVPs) are treated in the same way. Boundary and initial conditions are both modeled as constraints of the optimization problem. The constraints are imposed through the penalty function strategy. The penalty function in cooperation with weighted-residual functional constitutes fitness function which is central concept in evolutionary algorithms. The robust metaheuristic optimization technique of the PSO is employed to find the solution of the extended variational problem. Finally, illustrative examples demonstrate practicality and efficiency of the presented algorithm as well as its wide operational domain. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

One such novel application is to perform collaborative beamforming from a wireless sensor network consisting of multirotor aerial vehicles (MAVs). Collaborative beamforming from an airborne wireless sensor network can be an effective means of communication from an unobstructed vantage point. This paper explores the feasibility of such a network. We analyze the beam pattern fluctuations due to position errors from the MAV's unsteady station keeping. We show that the effects of minor position errors are manageable. Finally, two non-linear constrained optimization techniques for side lobe suppression utilizing the MAVs mobility and station keeping capability are introduced. We demonstrate through simulation that our techniques have similar performance while requiring lower computational cost and complexity compared to the conventional minimum variance distortion less response beamformer.	acoustic lobing;aerial photography;airborne ranger;beamforming;computation;computational complexity theory;constrained optimization;distortion;global positioning system;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;radiation pattern;randomness;sensor node;simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle;zero suppression	Tan A.

The algorithm, called HDDP, is a hybrid variant of differential dynamic programming, a proven second-order technique that relies on Bellman’s Principle of Optimality and successive minimization of quadratic approximations. The new hybrid method incorporates nonlinear mathematical programming techniques to increase efficiency: quadratic programming subproblems are solved via trust region and range-space active set methods, an augmented Lagrangian cost function is utilized, and a multiphase structure is implemented. In addition, the algorithm decouples the optimization from the dynamics using first- and second-order state transition matrices. A comprehensive theoretical description of the algorithm is provided in this first part of the two paper series. Practical implementation and numerical evaluation of the algorithm is presented in Part 2.	algorithm;differential dynamic programming;optimal control	Gregory Lantoine;Ryan P. Russell	2012	J.

90e35b7bc70759316dbce830423f3231d461a3d0	approximability of connected factors		Finding a d-regular spanning subgraph (or d-factor) of a graph is easy by Tutte’s reduction to the matching problem. By the same reduction, it is easy to find a minimal or maximal d-factor of a graph. However, if we require that the d-factor is connected, these problems become NP-hard – finding a minimal connected 2-factor is just the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Given a complete graph with edge weights that satisfy the triangle inequality, we consider the problem of finding a minimal connected d-factor. We give a 3approximation for all d and improve this to an (r + 1)-approximation for even d, where r is the approximation ratio of the TSP. This yields a 2.5-approximation for even d. The same algorithm yields an (r+1)-approximation for the directed version of the problem, where r is the approximation ratio of the asymmetric TSP. We also show that none of these minimization problems can be approximated better than the corresponding TSP. Finally, for the decision problem of deciding whether a given graph contains a connected d-factor, we extend known hardness results.	approximation algorithm;decision problem;file spanning;graph factorization;maximal set;social inequality;travelling salesman problem	Kamiel Cornelissen;Ruben Hoeksma;Bodo Manthey;N.

One can define a tower of groups, G, such that G = Aut(G). The Automorphism tower problem asks when does this construction stabilizes, i.e. when does G = G. Simon Thomas gave a short and simple set theoretic proof that it stops after less than (2|G|)+ steps. His proof, though simple, uses the axiom of Choice quite strongly. A couple of years ago, we succeeded in giving a Choiceless proof, which was also more informative. Recently, we have managed to improve that proof so that now it gives even more information, and covers some cases that we were not covered before by our proof (but followed easily from Thomas’ proof). The sort of information this proof gives may have some implication on the still open problem of finding a bound for the tower when the group is countable, using Polish spaces and descriptive set theory.	graph automorphism;information;set theory;simon;simple set	Itay Kaplan;Saharon Shelah	2009	Arch.

Our main assumption is that the primal cone is formed as a direct product of many small-dimensional convex cones, and that the matrix A of corresponding linear operator is uniformly sparse. In this case, our method can approximate the primal-dual optimal solution with accuracy ε in O ( 1 ε2 ) iterations. At the same time, complexity of each iteration of this scheme does not exceed O(rq log2 n) operations, where r and q are the maximal numbers of nonzero elements in the rows and columns of matrix A, and n is the number variables.	approximation algorithm;binary logarithm;column (database);conic optimization;iteration;maximal set;sparse matrix;subgradient method;the matrix;time complexity	Yurii Nesterov;S.

The field of stochastic optimization deals with such problems where the forecasts are specified in terms of probability distributions of future data. In this paper, we broaden the set of models as well as the techniques being considered for approximating stochastic optimization problems. For example, we look at stochastic models where the cost of the elements is correlated to the set of realized demands, and risk-averse models where upper bounds are placed on the amount spent in each of the stages. These generalized models require new techniques, and our solutions are based on a novel combination of the primal-dual method truncated based on optimal LP relaxation values, followed by a tree-rounding stage. We use these to give constant-factor approximation algorithms for the stochastic Steiner tree and single sink network design problems in these generalized models.	apx;approximation algorithm;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;network planning and design;queueing theory;risk aversion;rounding;steiner tree problem;stochastic optimization;stochastic process	Anupam Gupta;R.

The study is motivated by Gromov’s famous surface subgroup question: Does every one-ended hyperbolic group contain a subgroup which is isomorphic to the fundamental group of a closed surface of genus at least 2? In [9] and [3] the authors constructed and classified all groups acting simply transitively on the vertices of hyperbolic triangular buildings of the smallest non-trivial thickness. These groups gave the first examples of cocompact lattices acting simply transitively on vertices of hyperbolic triangular Kac-Moody buildings that are not right-angled. Here we study surface subgroups of the 23 torsion free groups obtained in [9]. With the help of computer searches we show, that in most of the cases there are no periodic apartments invariant under the action of a genus two surface. The existence of such an action implies the existence of a surface subgroup, but it is not known, whether the existence of a surface subgroup implies the existence of a periodic apartment. These groups are the first candidates for groups that have no surface subgroups arising from periodic apartments.	genus (mathematics);search algorithm;thickness (graph theory);torsion (gastropod);vertex (geometry)	Riikka Kangaslampi;Alina Vdovina	2017	Experimental Mathematics	10.1080/10586458.2015.1110541	hyperbolic manifold;combinatorics;relatively hyperbolic group;mathematical analysis;topology;hyperbolic group;mathematics;geometry;algebra	Theory	35.66588356963599	30.03084850284435	1079
1151a2afc701de80501724af1436ff2eeb481d81	quadrature down-conversion based analog self-interference cancellation for continuous wave radars		For continuous wave radars, self-interference signals coupled from the local transmitter are significantly stronger than the desired echoes, such that the receiver will become saturated. To cancel the self-interference, this paper proposes a novel scheme based on a simple quadrature down-conversion operation, for which two frequency-swept carriers with a 90-degree phase-difference are adopted in both transmitter and receiver to realize a high- sensitive reception of echoes as well as high isolation between the transmitter and the receiver. A search algorithm is proposed to minimize the power of the residual self-interference. Since both the desired echoes and the self-interference are replicas of the transmitted signal, the desired echoes may be mistaken for self-interference signals and attenuated significantly. Thus, this paper analyzes the impact of the proposed scheme on the desired echoes and develops a method to avoid the potential attenuation of the desired echoes. In addition, this paper derives a closed-form expression for the self-interference cancellation performance. Extensive simulations are performed to verify the proposed method.	interference (communication);multi-tap;rx microcontroller family;radar;search algorithm;simulation;transmitter;zero suppression	Hongtao Lu;Chuan Huang;Martin Taranetz;Stefan Schwarz;Shihai Shao	2016	2016 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2016.7849010	telecommunications	Mobile	61.5563758522873	60.70695265779521	1080

In this paper, we present results obtained from a large set of measurements performed at the University of Ottawa. We investigate impacts of receiver rotation and shadowing on the properties of indoor infrared channels. This paper contains a description of a measurement system developed and used throughout the experiments. Measurement results are used to find and present methods to estimate variations of channel path loss for small changes in the receiver direction, using statistical techniques. This would be useful for generating samples of channel path loss for system performance simulations and modulation analysis. Using the measurement results, it is shown that variations of channel path loss are smooth and a simple curve-fitting algorithm can be used to accurately interpolate intermediate values. It is also shown that for a receiver changing its elevation angle from 0 to 180 , five points along the entire path are sufficient to predict variation of channel path loss for the entire rotation range. The results also demonstrate a correlation between the channel delay spread and channel path loss for both diffuse and line-of-sight configurations. A simple formula can provide an estimate of channel delay spread for a known path loss of a given configuration. It is demonstrated that variations of channel path loss for small changes of receiver rotation can be described by a Gamma distribution. This enables generation of samples of channel path loss under general conditions for system-level simulation algorithms. Measurements have also been performed to investigate effects of shadowing on indoor infrared channel characteristics. Some important parameters that specify the impact of shadowing on the channel characteristics are included in the measurement plans. Variations of channel path loss due to shadowing and due to these parameters are investigated and detailed results are reported. It is shown that shadowing affects the channel delay spread. For the measured shadowing results, it is shown that channel path loss and delay spread are correlated and their relationship is provided.	algorithm;curve fitting;experiment;interpolation;line-of-sight (missile);modulation;system of measurement;system-level simulation	Mohammad Reza Pakravan;Mohsen Kavehrad	2001	IEEE Trans.

12be295a93f3cbdf6cb58ab69506998c630bd331	bipartitioning problems on graphs with bounded tree-width		For an undirected graph G, we consider the following problems: given a fixed graph H, can we partition the vertices of G into two non-empty sets A and B such that neither the induced graph G[A] nor G[B] contain H (i) as a subgraph? (ii) as an induced subgraph? These problems are NP-complete and are expressible in monadic second order logic (MSOL). The MSOL formulation, together with Courcelle's theorem implies linear time solvability on graphs with bounded tree-width. This approach yields algorithms with running time f(|phi|, t) * n, where |phi| is the length of the MSOL formula, t is the tree-width of the graph and n is the number of vertices of the graph. The dependency of f(|phi|, t) on |phi| can be as bad as a tower of exponentials. In this paper, we present explicit combinatorial algorithms for these problems for graphs G whose tree-width is bounded. We obtain 2^{O(t^r)} * n time algorithms when H is any fixed graph of order r. In the special case when H = K_r, a complete graph on r vertices, we get an 2^{O(t+r \log t)} * n time algorithm. The techniques can be extended to provide FPT algorithms to determine the smallest number q such that V can be partitioned into q parts such that none of the parts have H as a subgraph (induced subgraph).	algorithm;courcelle's theorem;graph (discrete mathematics);induced subgraph;np-completeness;parameterized complexity;time complexity;treewidth;vertex (geometry)	N.

c276f53e5bea9b1ab25c5abd2f129fa577ddb7a3	birkhoff-von-neumann switches with deflection-compensated mechanism.		Despite the high throughput and low complexity achieved by input scheduling based on Birkhoff-von-Neuman (BvN) decomposition; the performance of the BvN switch becomes less predictable when the input traffic is bursty. In this paper, we propose a deflection-compensated BvN (D-BvN) swit ch architecture to enhance the quasi-static scheduling based on BvN decomposition. The D-BvN switches provide capacity guaran tee for virtual circuits (VCs) and deflect bursty traffic when overflow occurs. The deflection scheme is devised to offset the excess ive buffer requirement of each VC when input traffic is bursty. The design of our conditional deflection mechanism is based o n the fact that it is unlikely that the traffic input to VCs is all bursty at the same time; most likely some starving VCs have spare capacities when some other VCs are in the overflow state . The proposed algorithm makes full use of the spare capacitie s of those starving VCs to deflect the overflow traffic to other inputs and provide bandwidth for the deflected traffic to reaccess the desired VC. Our analysis and simulation show that this deflection-compensated mechanism can support BvN switches to achieve close to 100% throughput of offered load even with bu rsty input traffic, and reduces the average end-to-end delay and d elay jitter. Also, our result indicates that the packet out-of-sequence probability due to deflection of overflow traffic is negligible, thus only a small re-sequencing buffer is needed at each output po rt.	algorithm;birkhoff interpolation;end-to-end principle;network packet;network switch;offset binary;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;virtual circuit	Jinghui Zhang;Tong Ye;Tony T.

Using a HWV controller, an unified approach can be taken for provisioning and management of virtualized heterogeneous radios, irrespective of their MAC and PHY layer mechanisms. It is shown that the airtime occupancy by transmissions from different slices or groups can be used as a single metric for tying these virtualized platforms. The HWV controller can account and dynamically re-provision slice quotas, which can be used for maximizing the network operator’s revenue or aggregate system throughput performance. Results from simulations show that an HWV controller based infrastructure is able to improve the revenue generated from a single virtualized basestation and an AP by up to 40% under tested conditions.	aggregate data;airtime;best, worst and average case;convex optimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;mathematical optimization;network architecture;optimization problem;phy (chip);provisioning;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;throughput	Gautam D.

Under IEEE 802.11p, this is attained through single-hop broadcasts of safety beacons in the control channel. However, high transmission power and node mobility can cause regions of node density to form rapidly. In such situations, excessive load on the control channel must be avoided to prevent performance degradation for safety applications. Existing congestion control schemes aim to reach a fair distribution of available channel resources, but fail to account for the differing quality of service QoS requirements of vehicles in different driving contexts. This context depends on many factors, including the relative position and velocity of its neighbors. The problem of adapting each vehicle's transmission probability under a slotted p-persistent vehicular broadcast medium access control MAC protocol is formulated as a network utility maximization NUM problem which takes the driving context into account. A distributed algorithm is proposed to solve this problem in a decentralized manner, its convergence is analyzed, and its performance is evaluated through simulations.	access control;distributed algorithm;elegant degradation;entropy maximization;message passing;network congestion;network packet;network utility;quality of service;requirement;simulation;velocity (software development)	Le Zhang;Shahrokh Valaee	2016	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2016.2521365	distributed algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;reliability;interference;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	6.403113149058883	88.1505927397831	1102

To launch applications quickly, modern mobile systems such as Android usually keep inactive applications in the background and manage them through an LRU-based activity stack. Whenever the user wants to run and interact with a background application again, that application can be switched back into the foreground quickly from the activity stack without delay in initializing the applications anew. Since background multimedia applications often continuously consume the battery power of the smart phone, the challenge is to effect a balance between application launch delay and battery lifetime. In this article, we propose innovative application management strategies that terminate “unbeneficial” background applications to save energy and pre-launch “beneficial” applications to improve the application launch delay. The proposed strategies are evaluated through a trace-driven simulation and a real experiment. The results show that the average application launch delay can be reduced by 15% while the average battery lifetime is increased by 18%.	android;application lifecycle management;experiment;kerrison predictor;pretail;simulation;smartphone;terminate (software)	Yi-Fan Chung;Yin-Tsung Lo;Chung-Ta King	2013	ACM Trans.

The proposed solution expresses binary (discrete) constraints of the sensor selection problem as continuous d.c. (difference of two convex functions/sets) constraint along with an exact penalty function approach. Thus, the problem is expressed as minimization of a d.c. function subject to convex constraints. Subsequent simulation results indicate that the proposed method is able to locate its optimal solution and that the network performance can be fully achieved by activating half of the available sensor nodes.	convex function;iteration;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;network performance;nonlinear system;penalty method;selection algorithm;sensor;simulation	Umar Rashid;Hoang Duong Tuan;Pierre Apkarian;Ha Hoang Kha	2012	2012 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2012.6380922	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	14.592666396433899	80.17976666983766	1111

The 14-bit static linearity is achieved by a background analog self calibration technique which is suitable for low voltage applications and does not require error measurement and correction circuits. The improved dynamic linearity at high frequencies, a low power track/attenuate output stage is used at the DAC output. Integral and differential nonlinearities of the proposed DAC corresponding to a 14-bit specification are less than 0.35LSB and 0.25LSB, respectively.

5714fd250883d10cd88e3cedef49baeb6f5f8035	position tolerance design method for array antenna in internet of things		The position error of array antenna significantly deteriorates the gain and sidelobe of the array, which seriously hinders the realization of high performance of communication antenna for Internet of Things (IoT). Based on the sensitivity analysis theory, the sensitivity of the array radiation field with respect to the position of the antenna element is derived. Besides, a novel design method of position tolerance for array antenna is proposed and applied to a planar array. Compared with the array designed by traditional method, the gain loss is basically the same (being 0.5 dB), while the peak sidelobe level is lowered by 1.937 dB ()/1.586 dB (). Besides, the uncertainty analysis results show that the newly designed array has a much higher chance to achieve the desired performance, which fully demonstrates the innovation and effectiveness of the new method.

The use of grounded capacitor makes the circuit ideal for integrated circuit implementation. The proposed filter can realize voltage-mode low-pass, band-pass, high-pass and band-stop filter responses without both component-matching condition requirement and inverting-type input signal requirement. High input impedance is possessed which can be directly connected in cascadability to implement high-order filter. The natural frequency and the quality factor can be orthogonally controlled. Also the natural frequency and quality factor can be electronically tuned. The active and passive sensitivities of the circuit are low. The workability of the proposed filter is confirmed by PSPICE simulator. From simulation results, it can be expressed that the proposed circuit agrees well with theory.	characteristic impedance;input impedance;integrated circuit;low-pass filter;operational amplifier;quartic function;simulation	Montree Kumngern;Panit Lamun	2012	2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks	10.1109/CICSyN.2012.23	butterworth filter;all-pass filter;voltage-controlled filter;low-pass filter;computer science;control theory;band-pass filter;high-pass filter;active filter	EDA	65.69614248465378	48.19118374286775	1119

460db8372025cd8a982f9da92f4ba92072bb7185	single event transients mitigation techniques for cmos integrated vcos		Abstract Single event transients (SETs) in analog integrated circuits result from the interaction of a heavy ion or high-energy proton with a sensitive p-n junction. SETs induce electron-hole pairs that can lead to current spikes, which propagate through the integrated circuit and can result in substantial transient peaks at the output voltage. This paper proposes techniques to mitigate SETs in CMOS voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs) without affecting circuit specifications. A VCO was designed to meet the IEEE 802.15.4 specifications. First, the weakest nodes were detected, and then particle strikes with a LET ranging from 14.47 to 57.86 MeV cm 2  mg −1 were applied at these nodes. Amplitude variation, recovery time and phase shift were obtained at the output nodes. RHBD techniques are discussed and applied to redesign the VCO. The proposed mitigation techniques reduce the recovery time by approximately 59%, the output phase displacement by 74.2% and the amplitude variation by 96.7%.	cmos;voltage-controlled oscillator	David González Ramírez;Sunil Lalchand Khemchandani;Javier del Pino;Daniel Mayor-Duarte;Mario San Miguel-Montesdeoca;Sergio Mateos-Angulo	2018	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2018.01.005	phase (waves);electronic engineering;engineering;voltage;amplitude;oscillation;voltage-controlled oscillator;ranging;integrated circuit;cmos	EDA	63.520803241314276	44.99657838061595	1122

A mobility model which represents movement behavior of considered application scenarios should incorporate important features that may change characteristics of mobile nodes. In most of the cases, mobile nodes used to move along predefined paths toward their destination. We propose a new mobility model which represents movement of mobile nodes in case of pre-defined structured area including attraction points to incorporate realistic behavior. We simulate performance of Ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol varying speed, load and node density. In terms of performances, average end-to-end delay is less in case of proposed mobility model. However, packet delivery ratio is found lower compare to random way point. The goal of our proposal is to model user’s realistic behavior in conventional routing protocols.	distance-vector routing protocol;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);network packet;performance;seamless3d;simulation;waypoint	Shiddhartha Raj Bhandari;Gyu Myoung Lee;Noël Crespi	2010	2010 8th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference	10.1109/CNSR.2010.27	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;mobility model;computer network	Mobile	2.852899020052249	85.51945573062096	1123

In these usages, the sensor data should be transmitted to receivers in real-time. There are, however, networks where the use of UDP is not permitted. In the case of TCP transmission, transmission of the latest sensor data is delayed by TCP's retransmission control after connection outage recovers. In this paper, we have proposed Retransmission-Controlled TCP that can continuously transmit only the latest data when connection outage occurs, and have evaluated an effectiveness of Retransmission-Controlled TCP using error model of cellular networks in hilly and mountainous area. As a consequence of the evaluation experiment, the time required for the client to receive the latest data is only 1.07[s] per a connection outage. Therefore, it is concluded that Retransmission-Controlled TCP can transmit the data in real-time such as UDP after the connection outage recovers.	downtime;real-time clock;retransmission (data networks);sun outage	Shuta Yokoyama;Hiroshi Yamamoto;Katsuyuki Yamazaki	2012	The International Conference on Information Network 2012	10.1109/ICOIN.2012.6164344	tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;zeta-tcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;computer network	Mobile	-3.698590939945317	91.09363610968174	1130

This is done by a knowledge-based system, which calculates estimations for the resulting system properties. The methodology starts with an abstract specification of the intended behavior, which is mapped onto a block diagram. The block diagram can then be evaluated by knowledge-based methods and by simulation.

The current work presents two very simple algorithms that utilize Gradecast to achieve Byzantine agreement and to solve the Approximate agreement problem [2]. An optimal approximate agreement algorithm was presented by Fekete [3] (see also [5]), which supports up to 1 n Byzantine nodes and has message complexity of O(n k ), where n is the number of nodes and k is the number of rounds. Our solution to the approximate agreement problem is optimal, simple and reduces the message complexity to O(k · n 3 ), while supporting 1 n Byzantine nodes. In the Byzantine consensus problem each node p has an input value vp ,a nd all non-faulty nodes are required to reach the same output value v (“agreement”),	algorithm	Michael Ben-Or;Danny Dolev;Ezra N.

In this article, we show how some physical layout constraints can be modeled geometrically and how Minkowski operations can be used to place instruments, and in particular antennas. The crucial step consists of placing an antenna by translation onto a satellite wall. The admissible space is therefore two-dimensional, although the instrument is three-dimensional. We propose an algorithm to efficiently compute the admissible space and describe its implementation. Experimental results on realistic examples are given.	brunn–minkowski theorem;satellite dish	Jean-Daniel Boissonnat;Eelco de Lange;Monique Teillaud	1998	Computer-Aided Design	10.1016/S0010-4485(97)00074-2	combinatorics;topology;computational geometry;computer aided design;mathematics;geometry;satellite	EDA	32.51354670772987	14.496534669744129	1158

This design shift has motivated the development of Frontier, a timing-driven FPGA placement system that uses design macroblocks in conjunction with a series of placement algorithms to achieve highly routable and high-performance layouts quickly. In the first stage of design placement, a macro-based floorplanner is used to quickly identify an initial layout based on intermacro connectivity. Next, FPGA routability and performance metrics are used to evaluate the quality of the initial placement. Finally, if the floorplan is determined to be insufficient from a routability or performance standpoint, a feedback-driven placement perturbation step is employed to achieve a lower cost placement. For a collection of large reconfigurable computing benchmark circuits our timing-driven placement system exhibits a 2.6× speedup in combined place and route time versus commercial FPGA CAD software with improved design performance for most designs. It is shown that floorplanning, placement evaluation, and backend optimization are all necessary to achieve high-performance placement solutions.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);computer-aided design;field-programmable gate array;floorplan (microelectronics);macroblock;mathematical optimization;place and route;reconfigurable computing;routing;simulated annealing;speedup	Russell Tessier	2002	ACM Trans.

d1a3404b9dcb1c23b02e671665d77cd97d4af4c3	a distributed anytime algorithm for network utility maximization with application to real-time ev charging control	secondary cells convergence distributed algorithms electric vehicles optimisation;convergence real time systems standards loading vectors optimization performance evaluation;protection devices distributed anytime algorithm network utility maximization real time ev charging control electric vehicle num problem convergence conditions asynchronous execution synchronous execution standard dual decomposition approach dynamic budgets	The control of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging to take full advantage of the available distribution network infrastructure represents a cornerstone for large-scale EV adoption and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed anytime algorithm to solve the Network Utility Maximization (NUM) problem with application to real-time EV charging control. We analyze its convergence conditions for synchronous and asynchronous execution. Beyond this, we evaluate our approach using real data and show its advantages against the standard dual decomposition approach. The control scheme in our approach is based on the notion of dynamic budgets defined by the protection devices and allocated to each EV charger. Given the system's current state, we solve EV charging as a NUM problem in a distributed manner and obtain closed form expressions for computations performed by EV chargers and protection devices. To cope with large EV numbers, their spatial distribution, and the highly dynamic state changes of the power grid, our approach allows for distributed computation capable of yielding feasible, albeit suboptimal, control values at any time.	anytime algorithm;battery charger;computation;distributed computing;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;extended validation certificate;ibm power systems;iteration;lagrangian relaxation;real-time clock	José Rivera;Hans-Arno Jacobsen	2014	53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2014.7039503	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;distributed computing	Robotics	3.434141439024795	4.390523864050488	1162

In this paper, we study stochastic geometry models for a shared cellular network consisting of base stations deployed by multiple mobile operators, based on real cellular network data coming from three European countries. Relying on a statistical approach as well as the evaluation of wireless network performance metrics, we show that the log-Gaussian Cox process provides the most compelling fitness results with real multi-operator base station deployment patterns and a model that offers some degree of analytical tractability. The model captures the fact that, in urban areas, there is strong correlation between the locations where the base stations of different operators are deployed. In contrast to that, in rural areas we observe some repulsion between antenna locations of different operators. Moreover, we observe that the behavior which can be modelled with the help of these processes occurs over and over again for similar areas in different countries, which suggests universality of the proposed models.	gaussian blur;network performance;software deployment;universality probability	Jacek Kibilda;Boris Galkin;Luiz A.

As a result, robustness of the algorithms becomes an important issue. However, traditional robust PCAs with probabilistic models require to perfectly know the distribution information of the estimation error (e.g. Gaussian distribution) which is difficult to obtain. Moreover, the distribution function of the actual error may not be Gaussian distribution. In this study, instead of using deterministic distribution model, a robust PCA based on a distribution-free method is designed to minimise total transmit power of secondary users subject to probabilistic interference and signal to interference plus noise ratio constraints. Based on the minimax probability machine, the original problem is reformulated as a second order cone programming problem solved by interior-point method. An adaptive estimation scheme is proposed to estimate the actual mean and covariance matrix of uncertain parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm by comparing with the robust algorithms under worst-case constraints and probabilistic constraints, respectively.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;cognitive radio;elegant degradation;interference (communication);interior point method;minimax;quality of service;quantization (physics);scheme;second-order cone programming;simulation	Yongjun Xu;Xiaohui Zhao	2014	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2014.0300	normal distribution;covariance matrix;mathematical optimization;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;quality of service;estimation of distribution algorithm;computer science;machine learning;interior point method;mathematics;statistics;principal component analysis	ML	41.55707817603099	91.3126822889252	1170

9e85c3bb98dd4c4ad49380a2dcff473471af31ab	the complexity of finding small separators in temporal graphs		Temporal graphs are graphs with time-stamped edges. We study the problem of finding a small vertex set (the separator) with respect to two designated terminal vertices such that the removal of the set eliminates all temporal paths connecting one terminal to the other. Herein, we consider two models of temporal paths: paths that pass through arbitrarily many edges per time step (non-strict) and paths that pass through at most one edge per time step (strict). Regarding the number of time steps of a temporal graph, we show a complexity dichotomy (NP-hardness versus polynomial-time solvability) for both problem variants. Moreover we prove both problem variants to be NP-complete even on temporal graphs whose underlying graph is planar. We further show that, on temporal graphs with planar underlying graph, if additionally the number of time steps is constant, then the problem variant for strict paths is solvable in quasi-linear time. Finally, we introduce and motivate the notion of a temporal core (vertices whose incident edges change over time). We prove that the non-strict variant is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the size of the temporal core, while the strict variant remains NP-complete, even for constant-size temporal cores. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Mathematics of computing → Paths and connectivity problems, Theory of computation → Fixed parameter tractability, Theory of computation → Problems, reductions and completeness	cobham's thesis;decision problem;directed graph;np-completeness;np-hardness;parameterized complexity;planar separator theorem;polynomial;strict function;theory of computation;time complexity;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Philipp Zschoche;Till Fluschnik;Hendrik Molter;Rolf Niedermeier	2018		10.4230/LIPIcs.MFCS.2018.45	discrete mathematics;combinatorics;vertex (geometry);mathematics;parameterized complexity;graph;planar	Theory	22.22279268539064	23.53101776897183	1180

The system is discretized by a backward Euler difference scheme for which a priori error analysis in themaximumnorm is constructed. It is shown from the a priori error bound that there exists a mesh with N subintervals that gives optimal error bound of O(N−1) which is robust with respect to the perturbation parameters. A partly heuristic argument based on a priori error analysis leads to a suitable monitor function. Based on an a posteriori error bound, a first-order rate of convergence, independent of all perturbation parameters, is established. A linear and a nonlinear examples are tested, and the numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptive moving grid method. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The primary advantages of the proposed ACF over piecewise constant ACF’s is that we obtain better control of selective improvement (or degradation) in either the passband or stopband or both, and we are not restricted to applying our methods to filters with piecewise constant pass and stopbands, since linear segments of slope 1 can be used to retain existing filter performance in either passband or stopband. The proposed ACF approximating polynomial (AP) is easy to compute, may be constrained to have simple (or integer) coefficients, and may be expressed as the AP of Kaiser and Hamming plus a correction polynomial. We also provide applications for motivation.	acf;coefficient;elegant degradation;piecewise linear continuation;polynomial;window function	Richard J.

(2000), network coding (NC) has been the focus of many research efforts and proposals. In particular, NC has been put forward as a means to increase the capacity of wireless mesh networks, by exploiting the broadcast nature of wireless links. However, in spite of the fairly large number of papers on the subject of network coding, the impact of NC on TCP performance in wireless mesh networks is still not fully understood. By means of a thorough simulation study, this paper aims thus at providing insights about the interaction between TCP's congestion control mechanisms and the underlying NC done by wireless relays. In particular, we focus on the influence of the main parameters related to the coding buffer used by such relays to encode packets. Our results suggest the feasibility of devising engineering rules for setting such parameters. Another main conclusion, in line with previous preliminary findings by the authors (Hassayoun et al., 2010) is that TCP performance can indeed be improved by the use of NC, but only as long as the wireless channel quality is above a certain level.	control system;encode;linear network coding;mesh networking;network congestion;relay;simulation;wireless mesh network;word lists by frequency	David Gómez;Sofiane Hassayoun;Arnaldo Herrero;Ramón Agüero;David Ros	2012	2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2012.6362888	wireless mesh network;throughput;linear network coding;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;transmission control protocol;distributed computing;zeta-tcp;tcp tuning;transport layer;wireless;encoding;computer network	Metrics	12.604709865562384	92.1032254520788	1185

Given A ∈ Qm×n1 , B ∈ Qm×n2 and b ∈ Q, a simple conic mixed-integer set (SCMIS) is a set of the form {(x, y) ∈ Z1 ×R2 | Ax+By− b ∈ C}. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of the closedness of convex hulls of SCMISs. Under certain technical conditions on the cone C, we show that the closedness characterization can be used to construct a polynomial-time algorithm to check the closedness of convex hulls of SCMISs. Moreover, we also show that the Lorentz cone satisfies these technical conditions. In the special case of pure integer problems, we present sufficient conditions, that can be checked in polynomial-time, to verify the closedness of intersection of SCMISs.	algorithm;convex cone;convex function;convex hull;convex set;polynomial;time complexity	R.

Based on this fusion criterion, the optimal information fusion input white noise deconvolution estimators are presented for discrete time-varying linear stochastic control system with multiple sensors and correlated noises, which can be applied to seismic data processing in oil exploration. A three-layer fusion structure with fault tolerant property and reliability is given. The first fusion layer and the second fusion layer both have netted parallel structures to determine the first-step prediction error cross-covariance for the state and the estimation error cross-covariance for the input white noise between any two sensors at each time step, respectively. The third fusion layer is the fusion center to determine the optimal matrix weights and obtain the optimal fusion input white noise estimators. The simulation results for Bernoulli-Gaussian input white noise deconvolution estimators show the effectiveness.	bernoulli polynomials;control system;cross-covariance;deconvolution;fault tolerance;lagrange multiplier;multitier architecture;normal statistical distribution;sample variance;simulation;stochastic control;white noise;sensor (device)	Shuli Sun	2004	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)	10.1109/TSMCB.2004.830349	econometrics;fault tolerance;data processing;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	57.0645436531914	4.475147896971295	1197

Filters are used to minimize the noise effect and eliminate the presence of higher order harmonics. In addition to that, a number of measurement algorithms apply orthogonal signal components obtained by two orthogonal finite-impulse response filters. The frequency response of the filters must have nulls at the higher order harmonic frequencies that are expected to be present in the signal and must have a unity gain at the main harmonic frequency. In the case of a time-varying frequency, the filter parameters have to be adapted during frequency estimation. In this paper, a simple method for online design of digital filters for sinusoidal signals is proposed. It is based on closed-form solutions for calculating filter coefficients. A simple linear algorithm for frequency estimation was used, and a derived algorithm for online adaptation of the filter coefficients is computationally very efficient. The number of subsections in the cascade and data window lengths can also be changed, depending on the frequency variations during measurement.	adaptive filter;algorithm;coefficient;digital filter;finite impulse response;frequency response;ibm power systems;spectral density estimation;unity;x window system	Miodrag D.

It is shown here that for finite duration (FIR) sequences with length N, the traditional representation is not suitable. Two new types of Ramanujan-sum expansions are proposed here for the FIR case, each offering an integer basis. One of these is particularly suited to identify periodicities in the FIR sequence. This representation in fact expresses any FIR sequence as a sum of orthogonal sequences each with a hidden periodicity corresponding to a divisor of N.	finite impulse response;quasiperiodicity	Palghat P.

90459509b86bc908305fa204db447960893fd042	adaptive lbt for licensed assisted access lte networks		In this paper, an adaptive channel access mechanism is proposed to optimize the performance of licensed- assisted access (LAA) long-term evolution (LTE) small cell networks through joint allocation of licensed and unlicensed spectrum resources all the while ensuring a fair coexistence with Wi-Fi service sets on the unlicensed spectrum. A listen-before- talk (LBT) access mechanism featuring an adaptive distributed control function (DCF) protocol is adopted for the small cell base stations (SBSs), whereby the minimum backoff window size is adaptively adjusted according to the available licensed spectrum bandwidth and Wi-Fi traffic load to satisfy the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of small cell users (SUs) and minimize the collision probability of Wi-Fi users. Meanwhile, both licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands are jointly allocated to optimize spectrum efficiency. An admission control mechanism is further developed for the SBSs to limit collision with Wi-Fi traffic.

In this paper, a specific application of IoT, named Safety Management System for Tower Crane Groups (SMS-TC), is proposed for use in the construction industry field. The operating status of each tower crane was detected by a set of customized sensors, including horizontal and vertical position sensors for the trolley, angle sensors for the jib and load, tilt and wind speed sensors for the tower body. The sensor data is collected and processed by the Tower Crane Safety Terminal Equipment (TC-STE) installed in the driver's operating room. Wireless communication between each TC-STE and the Local Monitoring Terminal (LMT) at the ground worksite were fulfilled through a Zigbee wireless network. LMT can share the status information of the whole group with each TC-STE, while the LMT records the real-time data and reports it to the Remote Supervision Platform (RSP) through General Packet Radio Service (GPRS).

5527a842784b4ae751d9cad49185e33bd25699a3	constructing equivariant vector bundles via the bgg correspondence		Abstract We describe a strategy for the construction of finitely generated G -equivariant Z -graded modules M over the exterior algebra for a finite group G . By an equivariant version of the BGG correspondence, M defines an object F in the bounded derived category of G -equivariant coherent sheaves on projective space. We develop a necessary condition for F being isomorphic to a vector bundle that can be simply read off from the Hilbert series of M . Combining this necessary condition with the computation of finite excerpts of the cohomology table of F makes it possible to enlist a class of equivariant vector bundles on P 4 that we call strongly determined in the case where G is the alternating group on 5 points.

Such rate-controlled service classes include adaptive ones whose holding time does not depend on the sending rate, while the holding time of elastic services becomes longer when their sending rate is slowed down. We develop a Markov model that allows us to study the impact of employing service differentiation (prioritization) during admission control and rate control on the classwise blocking probabilities and throughputs. The admission control takes into account the interference from adjacent cells as a log-normally distributed random variable and employs service class and state-dependent (soft) blocking in addition to hard blocking. The state-dependent rate control algorithm takes into account the minimum and maximum requested rates of admitted sessions in a fairness policy-dependent manner. Our conclusion is that work conserving bandwidth sharing policies may have a major impact on the moments of the time spent in the system by elastic services, but only a minor one on the classwise blocking probabilities. When the admission control algorithm takes into account the neighbour cell caused interference, the blocking probability of all classes increases somewhat, but the throughput of the accepted sessions increases. Blocking prioritization in the soft blocking model affects the classwise total blocking probabilities but has little impact on the throughput of adaptive and elastic traffic.

By using channel information at Base Station or Mobile Station we can remove or mitigate inter-user interference at multi-user MIMO systems. For designing of Mu-MIMO system we must attend to inter-user interference problem which can reduce performance and capacity of systems. capacity optimization, maximizing throughput under power restriction, power control problems or power minimization under satisfying minimum quality of service are some sample of such problem. None of them has closed form unless by applying some restriction at them. In this paper, we solve some of them by using block diagonalization and successive optimization methods with equal & adaptive power allocation methods.	capacity optimization;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-user mimo;quality of service;throughput	Mahdi Kashiha;Mehrdad Ardebilipour;Ehsan Soleimani-Nasab	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Information Security	10.1109/WCINS.2010.5541764	multi-user mimo;adaptive control;telecommunications;computer science;base station;operating system;wireless network;control theory;computer network	HPC	35.4078159762284	89.52633221423537	1234

In a cell-based network, a mobile should be able to seamlessly obtain transmission resources after handoff to a new base station. This is essential for both service continuity and quality of service assurance. In this paper, we present strategies for accommodating continuous service to mobile users through estimating resource requirements of potential handoff connections. A diverse mix of heterogeneous traffic with diverse resource requirements is considered. We investigate static and dynamic resource allocation schemes. The dynamic scheme probabilistically estimates the potential number of connections that will be handed off from neighboring cells, for each class of traffic. The performance of these strategies in terms of connection blocking probabilities for handoff and local new connection requests are evaluated. The performance is also compared to a scheme previously proposed in [15]. The results indicate that using dynamic estimation and allocation, we can significantly reduce the dropping probability for handoff connections.	blocking (computing);quality of service;requirement;scott continuity;service assurance;service-oriented architecture	Parameswaran Ramanathan;Krishna M.

We introduce a hybrid extragradient-like approximation method which is based on the well-known extragradient method and a hybrid (or outer approximation) method. The method produces three sequences which are shown to converge strongly to the same common element of F (S) ∩ ΩA. As applications, the method provides an algorithm for finding the common fixed point of a nonexpansive mapping and a pseudocontractive mapping, or a common zero of a monotone Lipschitz continuous mapping and a maximal monotone mapping.	algorithm;approximation;calculus of variations;converge;fixed point (mathematics);maximal set;social inequality;variational inequality;whole earth 'lectronic link;monotone	Lu-Chuan Ceng;Nicolas Hadjisavvas;Ngai-Ching Wong	2010	J.

We construct activity-driven clock trees wherein sections of the clock tree are turned off by gating the clock signals. Since gating the clock signal implies that additional control signals and gates are needed, there exists a tradeoff between the amount of clock tree gating and the total power consumption of the clock tree. We exploit similarities in the switching activity of the clocked modules to reduce the number of clock gates. Assuming a given switching activity of the modules, we propose three novel activity-driven problems: a clock tree construction problem, a clock gate insertion problem, and a zero-skew clock gate insertion problem. The objective of these problems is to minimize system’s power consumption by constructing an activity-driven clock tree. We propose an approximation algorithm based on recursive matching to solve the clock tree construction problem. We also propose an exact algorithm employing the dynamic programming paradigm to solve the gate insertion problems. Finally, we present experimental results that verify the effectiveness of our approach. This paper is a step in understanding how high-level decisions (e.g., behavioral design) can affect a low-level design (e.g., clock design).	approximation algorithm;clock rate;clock signal;digital electronics;dynamic programming;exact algorithm;high- and low-level;level design;low-level design;programming paradigm;recursion;synchronous circuit	Amir H.

The bounded max-vertex/edge-coloring problems ask for such a coloring minimizing the sum of all color classes’ weights. In this paper we present complexity results and approximation algorithms for those problems on general graphs, bipartite graphs and trees. We first show that both problems are polynomial for trees, when the number of colors is fixed, and Hb approximable for general graphs, when the bound b is fixed. For the bounded max-vertex-coloring problem, we show a 17/11-approximation algorithm for bipartite graphs, a PTAS for trees as well as for bipartite graphs when b is fixed. For unit weights, we show that the known 4/3 lower bound for bipartite graphs is tight by providing a simple 4/3 approximation algorithm. For the bounded max-edge-coloring problem, we prove approximation factors of 3− 2/ √ 2b, for general graphs, min{e, 3 − 2/ √ b}, for bipartite graphs, and 2, for trees. Furthermore, we show that this problem is NP-complete even for trees. This is the first complexity result for max-coloring problems on trees.	approximation algorithm;color;edge coloring;graph coloring;np-completeness;ptas reduction;polynomial	Evripidis Bampis;Alexander V.

The typical parallel RS architecture requires huge hardware cost to achieve very high speed transmission data rate for optical systems. This brief presents an area-efficient VLSI architecture of the RS decoder by using a novel just-in-time folding modified Euclidean algorithm (JIT-FMEA). The JIT-FMEA VLSI architecture can greatly reduce the hardware complexity by about 50% compared with the fully expanded parallel RS architecture. Meanwhile, it can achieve very high throughput rate for the 10Gbase-LX4 optical communication system. The proposed RS decoder architecture has been designed and implemented by using 0.18-mum CMOS standard cell technology at a supply voltage of 1.8 V. The post-layout simulation results show that the design requires only about 20 K gates and can achieve the data processing rate of 3.2 Gb/s at a clock frequency of 400 MHz	cmos;clock rate;data rate units;error detection and correction;euclidean algorithm;failure mode and effects analysis;forward error correction;gigabyte;just-in-time compilation;reed–solomon error correction;simulation;standard cell;throughput;very-large-scale integration	Huai-Yi Hsu;An-Yeu Wu;Jih-Chiang Yeo	2004	Proceedings of 2004 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Advanced System Integrated Circuits	10.1109/TCSII.2006.882360	electronic engineering;parallel computing;data processing;telecommunications;computer science;very-large-scale integration	HPC	44.412752532309796	62.487568075286184	1256

The model formulation consists of a two-scale model in which a set of microscale diffusion equations representing ion exchange resin particles that vary in size and age are coupled through a boundary condition with a macroscopic ordinary differential equation (ODE), which represents the concentration of a species in a well-mixed reactor. We introduce a new age-averaged model (AAM) that averages all ion exchange particle ages for a given size particle to avoid the expensive Monte-Carlo simulation associated with previous modeling applications. We discuss two different numerical schemes to approximate both the original Monte Carlo algorithm and the new AAM for this two-scale problem. The first scheme is based on the finite element formulation in space coupled with an existing backward-difference-formula-based ODE solver in time. The second scheme uses an integral equation based Krylov deferred correction (KDC) method and a fast elliptic solver (FES) for the resulting elliptic equations. Numerical results are presented to validate the new AAM algorithm, which is also shown to be more computationally efficient than the original Monte Carlo algorithm. We also demonstrate that the higher order KDC scheme is more efficient than the traditional finite element solution approach and this advantage becomes increasingly important as the desired accuracy of the solution increases. We also discuss issues of smoothness, which affect the efficiency of the KDC-FES approach, and outline additional algorithmic changes that would further improve the efficiency of these developing methods for a wide range of applications.	active appearance model;alcohol consumption;algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;correction text:find:pt:contact lens.left:nar;differential diagnosis;finite difference;finite element method;ion exchange;ions;iontophoresis;key distribution center;krylov subspace;leucaena pulverulenta;monte carlo algorithm;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;numerical method;query priority - deferred;reactor (software);reactor device component;resin;shin megami tensei: persona 3;simulation;solver;spectrometry, mass, fast atom bombardment	Sunyoung Bu;Jingfang Huang;Treavor H.

The merge of data sets @ and 63 on p processors has a time complexity of O((l@.l + l @ l ) / p ) + O(1og (min (I@(, 163 I))) in its asynchronous form and a space complexity of 2(l@l + 1631). A benchmark sorting algorithm is proposed which uses this merge to remove the linear time bottleneck inherent in previous multiprocessor sorts. This sort when applied to data set C? on p processors has a time complexity of O((n log n ) / p ) + O((n log p ) / p ) and a space complexity of 2n. It is therefore most applicable to problems on shared memory multiprocessors for which p -=% n. Evaluations of the merge and benchmark sort algorithms on a 12-processor Sequent Balance 21000 system' demonstrate near linear speedup when compared to sequential Quicksort.	benchmark (computing);central processing unit;dspace;mimd;maxima and minima;multiprocessing;parallel algorithm;quicksort;sequent calculus;shared memory;sorting algorithm;speedup;time complexity	Rhys S.

7c6ebb76d9545d5d92e7f572bcf423994b7de67d	thermodynamic-ram technology stack	memristor;neuromorphic;machine learning;artificial intelligence	We introduce a technology stack or specification describing the multiple levels of abstraction and specialization needed to implement a neuromorphic processor based on the theory of AHaH Computing. This specific implementation is called Thermodynamic-RAM (kT-RAM). Bringing us closer to brain-like neural computation, kT-RAM will provide a generalpurpose adaptive hardware resource to existing computing platforms enabling fast and low-power machine learning capabilities that are currently hampered by the separation of memory and processing. The motivation for defining the technology stack is two-fold. First, explaining kT-RAM is much easier if it is broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Secondly, groups interested in realizing kT-RAM can choose a level to contribute to that matches their interest and expertise. The levels of the Thermodynamic-RAM technology stack include the memristor, Knowm-Synapse, AHaH Node, kT-RAM, kT-RAM instruction set, sparse spike encoding, kT-RAM emulator, and SENSE Server.	artificial neural network;computation;emulator;low-power broadcasting;machine learning;memristor;neuromorphic engineering;partial template specialization;principle of abstraction;random-access memory;solution stack;sparse matrix;synapse	M.

The basic idea is to combine the scaled memoryless BFGS method and the preconditioning technique in the frame of the conjugate gradient method. The preconditioner, which is also a scaled memoryless BFGS matrix, is reset when the Beale-Powell restart criterion holds. The parameter scaling the gradient is selected as the spectral gradient. In very mild conditions, it is shown that, for strongly convex functions, the algorithm is globally convergent. Computational results for a set consisting of 750 unconstrained optimization test problems show that this new scaled conjugate gradient algorithm substantially outperforms the known conjugate gradient methods including the spectral conjugate gradient by Birgin and Martinez [Birgin, E. and Martinez, J.M., 2001, A spectral conjugate gradient method for unconstrained optimization.

Temporal focusing property supported by TR, mitigates the complexity of receiver by reducing the effective channel taps. In spite of its good performance in perfect channel state information (CSI), TR method is very sensitive to the channel estimation error. The effect of channel imperfection on TR technique is considered the study. At first, the bit error rate (BER) of the TR-UWB communication system under the assumptions of the simple matched filter (MF) receiver under the channel estimation errors is derived in closed-form. Then, based on optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator receiver, a pre-filter is calculated in closed-form to improve the performance of the TR-UWB system in an imperfect CSI scenario. Furthermore, in order to compare the results, similar calculation for pre-filter is carried out based on a simple MF receiver. Unfortunately, it was not possible for us to drive a closed-form solution for pre-filter in this case. To overcome this shortcoming, a two stage iteration-based algorithm is developed at transmitter to calculate a pre-filter in MF receiver. This improved algorithm causes the channel estimation error tends to zero in some steps for the TR-UWB system with MF. The initial value for this iteration-based improved algorithm is considered to be closed-form pre-filter where is calculated based on TR-UWB system with an optimal MMSE estimator. Finally, exhaustive simulations are done to demonstrate the performance advantage attained by the proposed algorithms.	channel state information;t-symmetry;time reversal signal processing;ultra-wideband	S.

Even though the existing path recovery scheme for AODV routing protocol can recover the disconnected path in some ways, however, they can not utilize the pre-connected routing nodes when we handle the nodes in Ad-hoc environment. In order to utilize the pre-connected routing nodes in recovering the path more effectively, we use a designated candidate nodes. The candidate nodes are used to recover the disconnected path using the pre-connected routing information. This scheme produces better results with less control packets with faster path recovery time.

270c232a9d89c0ce7f5d3f816edc818a5d650bb0	junction based routing: a scalable technique to support source routing in large noc platforms	router architecture;source routing;deadlock free routing;engineering and technology;teknik och teknologier;junction;networks on chip	To support communication among hundreds of cores on a chip, on-chip communication must be well organized. In the embedded systems using such a chip, the communication patterns can be profiled off-line and routing can be well planned. Source routing has been shown to be suitable in such contexts [1]. However, source routing has one serious drawback of overhead for storing the path information in header of every packet. This disadvantage becomes worse as the size of the network grows. In this paper we propose a technique, called Junction Based Routing (JBR), to remove this limitation. In the proposed technique, path information for only a few hops is stored in the packet header. With this information, either the packet reaches the destination, or reaches a junction from where the path information for on-ward path is picked up. There are many interesting issues related to this approach. We discuss and solve two important issues related to JBR, namely, the required number of junctions and their positions and path computation for efficient deadlock-free routing. A simulator has been developed to evaluate the performance of JBR and compare it with simple source routing. We observe that JBR has slightly worse performance as compared to pure source routing for packets with large payload. But JBR has a potential of higher performance for packets with small payloads.	computation;deadlock;embedded system;network on a chip;network packet;online and offline;overhead (computing);scalability;source routing	Shabnam Badri;Rickard Holsmark;Shashi Kumar	2012		10.1145/2401716.2401727	policy-based routing;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;loose source routing;static routing;source routing;real-time computing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Arch	-0.16376743644660416	84.18566332915087	1303
6a214f7ccc05a16dabb86e955d856211c7e23b81	vision: the case for cellular small cells for cloudlets	lte;cloudlets;small cells	Today's cellular networks are built with``macro cell'' basestations connected to the Internet via a rigid, complicated backhaul. Even with state-of-art technologies like LTE, users get limited throughput and high latency, with high variance. Performance enhancing IP boxes are deployed in the cellular operator's datacenters, far from the user. As a result, the most compelling cloudlet applications are difficult to realize on such networks and cloudlet researchers have thus far focused on Wi-Fi networks only.  We argue that the cloudlet community should consider small cell networks in addition to Wi-Fi networks. Small cells, such as femtocells and picocells, are relatively new additions to the cellular standards. By reducing the cell size compared to the traditional macro cells, they increase spatial reuse of precious licensed frequencies. Users get higher bandwidth and lower latency, with relatively less variance. This architecture, where small cells are deployed simply with power and Ethernet connectivity, lends itself well to cloudlet augmentation. In this position paper, we describe why deployed macro cell basestations are unsuitable for cloudlet deployment. In contrast, we describe why a small cell architecture is amenable for cloudlet deployments. Our experience from operating a small cell testbed in licensed frequencies matches that reported by equipment vendors. The applications we care about require high throughput and low latency. In a cellular network this can be achieved today by augmenting small cells with powerful cloudlets.	backhaul (telecommunications);cell (microprocessor);cloudlet;compaq lte;internet;software deployment;testbed;throughput	Sharad Agarwal;Matthai Philipose;Paramvir Bahl	2014		10.1145/2609908.2609946	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;lte advanced;operating system;small cell;computer network	Mobile	21.686563493752043	88.01786192931807	1312

They are mobile wireless networks that feature inherent connection disruption. In particular such networks are generally non-connected. In this paper we focus on defining a broadcast service which operate on DTNs. A number of protocols solving the problem of broadcasting across DTNs have been proposed in the past, but all of them exhibit a static behavior, i.e. they provide no control parameter. However, at the application level, flexible broadcasting schemes are desirable. In particular, it is important that the user (the source of the broadcast message) can control the way the message gets spread across the network. This paper introduces a new broadcasting protocol dedicated to DTNs, called Context-Aware Broadcasting Protocol (CABP), which adapts its greediness according to the “urgency” (priority) of the broadcast message. A formal presentation of its strategy is proposed and through preliminary experiments, the cost-effectiveness of CABP is enlightened.	bandwidth (signal processing);denial-of-service attack;experiment;hoc (programming language);mobile phone;refinement (computing);statistical model	Luc Hogie;Grégoire Danoy;Pascal Bouvry;Frédéric Guinand	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-87477-5_54	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;radio access network;optimized link state routing protocol;broadcast radiation;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;wireless wan;public land mobile network;computer science;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;delay-tolerant networking;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	0.5898163601107809	84.16383838526077	1316

We give an illustrative example about the difficulty of pure Ant Algorithms solving strongly constrained problems. Therefore, we explore the addition of Constraint Programming mechanisms in the construction phase of the ants, so they can complete their solutions.

In particular, we show that the hard delay and packet loss constraints demanded by real time services constrain the size of the wireless backhaul to a few nodes when single-NIC nodes are used. Furthermore, this constraint depends on the link rate. This limitation is due to overlapping carrier sensing ranges that generate additional delay due to contention, which results in a strong degradation of the overall quality of the conversation. For the scenarios tested, the utilization of multi-NIC nodes overcomes these problems by allowing keeping the delay and losses within acceptable values while permitting larger wireless backhauls in terms of number of nodes. In this way, the MAC 802.11 policy keeps on playing a prevalent role in the very actual trend to build `all-wireless' architectures in spite of the limitations experienced in the single-NIC case	backhaul (telecommunications);codec;elegant degradation;internet backbone;network interface controller;network packet	Pasquale Falconio;Josep Mangues-Bafalluy;Marc Cardenete-Suriol;Marc Portoles-Comeras	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications	10.1109/WIMOB.2006.1696360	wireless mesh network;wi-fi;telecommunications;computer science;voice over ip;network interface controller;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-1.77151572020198	88.00550952914058	1330
aaba5df408ad8985c0937c314718ec8509a6fe12	approximations of the generalized cascade model		The study of infection processes is an important field of science both from the theoretical and the practical point of view, and has many applications. In this paper we focus on the popular Independent Cascade model and its generalization. Unfortunately the exact computation of infection probabilities is a #P-complete problem [8], so one cannot expect fast exact algorithms. We propose several methods to efficiently compute infection patterns with acceptable accuracy. We will also examine the possibility of substituting the Independent Cascade model with a computationally more tractable model.	approximation algorithm;cobham's thesis;computation;graph (discrete mathematics);heuristic;kempe chain;monte carlo method;p-complete;sharp-p-complete;simulation;time complexity	András Bóta;Miklós Krész;András Pluhár	2013	Acta Cybern.	10.14232/actacyb.21.1.2013.4	mathematics;approximations of π;discrete mathematics;computation;cascade	ML	14.303933049184224	17.599533047777008	1332

In this SCVM, the power part is composed of two mc-stage SC cells (front) and two nc-stage SC cells (rear) in cascade, and these cells are operated by two-phase nonoverlapping clocks for an interleaved operation with voltage gain of mc × nc at most. This paper presents the VCR control to change the running stage number m,n and topological path for a more flexible and suitable gain level m × n (1 × 1, 2 × 1, 2 × 2, 3 × 1, 3 × 2, 3 × 3,…, mc × nc) according to the desired output so as to improve power efficiency, especially for the lower output. Besides, PWM is adopted not only to enhance output regulation for different outputs, but also to reinforce output robustness to source/loading variation. Further, some theoretical analysis and design include: SCVM model, steady-state analysis, conversion ratio, power efficiency, output ripple, stability, capacitance selection, and control design. Finally, the closed-loop SCVM is simulated, and the hardware is implemented and tested. All the results are illustrated to show the efficacy of the proposed scheme.	dc-to-dc converter;multistage amplifier;switched capacitor;voltage multiplier	Yuen-Haw Chang	2012	Journal of Circuits, Systems, and Computers	10.1142/S0218126612500235	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	EDA	65.00788434381532	41.46461042603506	1334

The root cause of these problems lies in its communication mechanisms. We argue in this paper that the models that have been used to study distributed algorithms on Bluetooth networks do not adequately model these networks in most cases, and were often oversimplified. This is mainly due to how the many restrictions that the Bluetooth specifications impose on such networks are taken into account, and the lack of “shared knowledge” of these restrictions among the researchers of this field. We give some examples to back our argument. We give also some suggestions and proposals to overcome these issues.	bluetooth;distributed algorithm;hoc (programming language)	Ahmed Jeddah;Nejib Zaguia;Guy-Vincent Jourdan	2009	2009 IEEE 6th International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5337026	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;distributed algorithm;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;ant;computer network	Mobile	0.5459943789976294	83.82302663902023	1336

a8b47cf1ba53d5c6c66f4951913a6acd62e813d3	fast analysis of wide-band scattering from electrically large targets with time-domain parabolic equation method	wideband scattering analysis;time domain parabolic equation method	An efficient three-dimensional time domain parabolic equation (TDPE) method is proposed to fast analyze the narrow-angle wideband EM scattering properties of electrically large targets. The finite difference (FD) of Crank–Nicolson (CN) scheme is used as the traditional tool to solve the time-domain parabolic equation. However, a huge computational resource is requiredwhen themeshes become dense. Therefore, the alternating direction implicit (ADI) scheme is introduced to discretize the time-domain parabolic equation. In this way, the reduced transient scattered fields can be calculated line by line in each transverse plane for any time step with unconditional stability. As a result, less computational resources are required for the proposed ADI-based TDPE method when compared with both the traditional CNbased TDPEmethod and the finite-different time-domain (FDTD)method. By employing the rotating TDPE method, the complete bistatic RCS can be obtained with encouraging accuracy for any observed angle. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

According to the fully implicit difference method, time and spatial discretization of the model lead to a set of nonlinear equations, which can be transferred into a group of linear equations. On the basis of double-media fully implicit method, the linear equations is obtained, which can be solved using the Jacobi-iteration preconditioner because of its high stability and fast convergence speed of the solution positively. By using the mathematical model to analyze the ZP-1 well in Qinshui Basin, the pressure distribution is obtained and the effect of orthotropic physical properties of coal cleats on pressure is analyzed. The mathematical model lays a foundation for coalbed gas exploitation.	computer simulation;explicit and implicit methods;numerical analysis;numerical weather prediction;two-phase locking		2010		10.1109/ICNC.2010.5583667	mathematical optimization;hydrology;calculus;mathematics	EDA	91.85848926401947	4.800643475802454	1359

In our design the test response is compacted by several multiple input shift registers without feedback (NF-MISR). The shift registers are driven by a clock which is k times faster than the slower test clock of the scan chains. For each test clock cycle only one out of the k different outputs of each shift register is evaluated by the ATE. To mitigate the negative effects of consecutive X values within the scan chains, a permutation of the NF-MISR inputs is periodically applied. Thus, no additional external control signals or test set dependent control logic is required. The possibilities of an implementation on a Verigy ATE will be described. The presented results for three industrial circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to a commercial ATPG tool.	built-in test equipment;clock rate;clock signal;data compaction;data rate units;new foundations;sampling (signal processing);shift register;test data;test set;uncompressed video	Martin Hilscher;Michael Braun;Michael Richter;Andreas Leininger;Michael Gössel	2008	2008 13th European Test Symposium	10.1109/ETS.2008.38	acceleration;clock;compaction;automatic test equipment;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer hardware;clock skew;computer science;engineering;automatic test pattern generation;test compression;feedback;shift register	EDA	24.176071684219984	52.23971700429041	1364

In a typical cellular radio application, the performance-limiting impairment is interference due to synchronous data streams from other co-channel and adjacent channel users (CCI and ACI). The receiver under consideration employs an adaptive fractionally spaced decision feedback equalizer (DFE) which exploits the correlation of the cyclostationary interference to achieve superior performance relative to the worst case when the interference is stationary noise. This paper presents ideal calculations which confirm that significant DFE performance gains are potentially achievable by explicitly accounting for the cyclostationary CCI. 'Ifvo adaptive DFE strategies are considered. One approach is to adapt the DFE directly using iterative algorithms such as least mean square (LMS) or recursive least squares (RLS). Another approach is to compute the MMSE DFE using an RLS CIR estimate and a sample estimate of the CCI autocorrelation obtained from the channel impulse response (CIR) estimation error during training. The best approach for adaptive equalization, in terms of adaptation speed and system performance, is to employ an RLS DFE which does not explicitly estimate the CIR or the CCI autocorrelation.	adaptive equalizer;adaptive filter;algorithm;autocorrelation;best, worst and average case;committed information rate;cyclostationary process;equalization (communications);interference (communication);iteration;least mean squares filter;mean squared error;mobile phone;multipath propagation;recursion;recursive least squares filter;stationary process	Norm W.

This formal power series can be considered as an exponential version of the Hilbert series of a flag variety. In this context, we compute a simple closed form for the exponential generating function in terms of finitely many differential operators and the Stirling polynomials. We prove that this series converges to a product of a rational polynomial and an exponential, and that, by summing the constant term and linear coefficient of this polynomial, we recover the dimension of the representation.

One of the major tasks of the platform is to select the appropriate UAVs for a particular IoT task. This selection may be based on different criteria, such as UAV's equipment, energy budget and geographical proximity of the UAV to the area of interest. For the selection mechanism, this paper proposes and formulates two Linear Integer Problem (LIP) optimization solutions by aiming at minimizing the energy consumption and shortening the UAV operation time. These two solutions are dubbed Energy-Aware Selection of UAVs (EAS) and Delay- Aware Selection of UAVs (DAS). They are both evaluated through simulations. The obtained results show that if the objective is energy efficiency, EAS is more efficient than DAS in terms of reducing the total energy consumption by the UAVs. Additionally, if the time is the objective, DAS exhibits better performance than EAS in terms of operation time.	mathematical optimization;operation time;simulation;telecommunications network;unmanned aerial vehicle	Naser Hossein Motlagh;Miloud Bagaa;Tarik Taleb	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842359	embedded system;simulation;computer science;computer security;internet of things	EDA	10.763940310020192	71.65826830414602	1380

The proposed algorithm performs Chase-like decoding using a priori knowledge of the source symbol sequence and the compressed bit stream lengths. Simulation results show that the proposed decoding algorithm leads to significant performance gain in comparison with classical arithmetic decoding, while exhibiting very low complexity. The practical relevance of the proposed technique is validated in the case of image transmission across the AWGN channel.

As a pursuit of this, in the following pages, sufficient conditions are given for the existence of positive continuous solutions to some possibly singular quadratic integral equations. Meanwhile, we prove the existence of maximal and minimal solutions of our problems. The method used here depends on both Schauder and Schauder-Tychonoff fixed point principles. Unlike all previous contributions of the same type, no assumptions in terms of the measure of noncompactness were imposed on the nonlinearity of the given functions. As far as we know, the approach presented in this paper, in particular, the discussion of the existence of maximal and minimal solutions to the quadratic integral equations was never applied in the field of the quadratic integral equations and so is new.

Most of the authors agree on saying that the traffic measured on today’s broadband networks is long-range dependent. Oddly enough these contributors do not question the stationarity of the traffic on these long time scales when the hypothesis of stationarity is essential to speak of long-range dependence. Concurrently it has been demonstrated that some kind of non stationarities in a short-range dependent process can lead, if they are not detected, to the untrue conclusion of long-range dependence.

A new radio interface with time division duplexing and radio access based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing is implemented in a 5G testbed to support ultra-high speed transmission with low latency. Experimental results in an outdoor open-space parking area show that the peak throughput is 2.8 Gbps in front of a base station (BS) antenna with a high reference signal received power (RSRP) although rank 2 is selected due to the high antenna correlation. The results also show that the average throughput of 2 Gbps is achieved 120 m from the BS antenna. In a courtyard enclosed by building walls, 3.6 Gbps is achieved in an outdoor-to-outdoor environment with a high RSRP and in an outdoor-to-indoor environment where the RSRP is lower due to the penetration loss of glass windows, but a multipath rich environment contributes to actualizing a low antenna correlation.	data rate units;dbm;duplex (telecommunications);experiment;frequency band;ku band;mimo;microsoft windows;mobile phone;multi-user;multiplexing;multipoint ground;software propagation;telecommunications link;testbed;throughput;transmission (bittorrent client)	Kiichi Tateishi;Daisuke Kunta;Atsushi Harada;Yoshihisa Kishiyama;Stefan Parkvall;Erik Dahlman;Johan Furuskog	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343416	throughput;3g mimo;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;antenna;correlation;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	26.239979078136283	82.5812370489213	1425

The impact of cascading failures on such networks has recently received significant attention due to the corresponding effect of these failures on the society. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on the robustness of interdependent systems formed by the coupling of power grids and communication networks by putting real distribution power grids to the test. We focus on the assessment of the robustness of a large set of medium-voltage (MV) distribution grids, currently operating live in the Netherlands, against cascading failures initiated by different types of faults / attacks. We consider both unintentional random failures and malicious targeted attacks which gradually degrade the capability of the entire system and we evaluate their respective consequences. Our study shows that current MV grids are highly vulnerable to such cascades of failures. Furthermore, we discover that a small-world communication network structure lends itself to the robustness of the interdependent system. Also interestingly enough, we discover that the formation of hub hierarchies, which is known to enhance independent network robustness, actually has detrimental effects against cascading failures. Based on real MV grid topologies, our study yields realistic insights which can be employed as a set of practical guidelines for distribution system operators (DSOs) to design effective grid protection schemes.	cascading failure;centrality;clustering coefficient;cyber-physical system;degree distribution;fragmentation (computing);grid computing;interdependence;interdependent networks;iterative method;mv-algebra;network model;network topology;robustness of complex networks;small-world experiment;sparse matrix;sysop;telecommunications network;usb hub	Wei Koong Chai;Vaios Kyritsis;Konstantinos Vasileios Katsaros;George Pavlou	2016	2016 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking) and Workshops	10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2016.7497224	real-time computing;engineering;distributed computing;interdependent networks;computer security	HPC	-3.018631832022704	7.227799719721421	1433

In this paper we investigate the problem of optimal compression of propositional Horn production rule knowledge bases.

b239944dae427c573df9be240a8407f44ef485f2	salam: a scalable anchor-free localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks	dissertation	Title of dissertation: SALAM: A SCALABLE ANCHOR-FREE LOCALIZATION ALGORITHM FOR WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS Adel Amin Abdel Azim Youssef, Doctor of Philosophy, 2006 Dissertation directed by: Professor Ashok K. Agrawala Department of Computer Science In this dissertation, we present SALAM, a scalable anchor-free protocol for localization in wireless sensor networks. SALAM can determine the positions of sensor nodes without any infrastructure support. We assume that each node has the capability to estimate distances to its corresponding neighbors, that are within its transmission range. SALAM allows to trade the accuracy of the estimated position against node transmission range and/or computational power. The application layer can choose from a whole range of different options, to estimate the sensor node’s positions with different accuracy while conserving battery power. Scalability is achieved by dividing the network into overlapping multi-hop clusters each with its own cluster head node. Each cluster head is responsible for building a local relative map corresponding to its cluster using intra-cluster node’s range measurements. To obtain the global relative topology of the network, the cluster head nodes collaboratively combine their local maps using simple matrix transformations. In order for two cluster heads to perform a matrix transformation, there must be at least three boundary nodes that belongs to both clusters (i.e. the two clusters are overlapping with degree ≥ 3). We formulate the overlapping multi-hop clustering problem and present a randomized distributed heuristic algorithm for solving the problem. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through analytical analysis and simulation. A major problem with multi-hop relative location estimation is the error accumulated in the node position as it becomes multi-hop away from the cluster head node. We analyze different sources of error and develop techniques to avoid these errors. We also show how the local coordinate system (LCS) affects the accuracy and propose different heuristics to select the LCS. Simulation results show that SALAM achieves precise localization of sensors. We show that our approach is scalable in terms of communication overhead regardless of the network size. In addition, we capture the impact of different parameters on the accuracy of the estimated node’s positions. The results also show that SALAM is able to achieve accuracy better than the current ad-hoc localization algorithms.

In a grid-connected PV system a power inverter is required to optimize the energy transfer from the photovoltaic modules to the power grid. Considering the nonlinear time-varying nature of grid-connected PV systems allows to obtain well-defined mathematical description of the problem that can be useful for the design of control schemes. Nevertheless, control structures that explicitly take into account the non-linear electrical model of the PV modules usually depend on parameters that are unknown and/or difficult to measure. Consequently, such controllers should normally be used with estimator schemes. In the present paper a control and estimator scheme for a full-bridge central PV inverter which is valid for a wide range of PV technologies is presented. As shown with a simulation study, the required control objectives have been achieved and the unknown temperature dependent have been correctly estimated.	ccir system a;control flow;nonlinear system;page view;performance per watt;power inverter;simulation	Carlos Meza;Romeo Ortega	2013	2013 XXIV International Conference on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies (ICAT)	10.1109/ICAT.2013.6684052	control engineering;nominal power;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;engineering;photovoltaic system;control theory;rooftop photovoltaic power station;grid-connected photovoltaic power system	EDA	64.08560230470086	37.99151873803526	1447

The plurality of orthogonal sets is generated using any single two-level autocorrelation sequence of period one less than the desired spreading factor of the orthogonal codes. The proposed method hence generates orthogonal codes of all spreading factors for which a corresponding two-level autocorrelation sequence exists. The resulting orthogonal sets with wide choice of spreading factors is desirable in synchronous direct sequence spread spectrum systems. The sets can be generated such that they do not contain the codeword with single polarity as in the case of Walsh-Hadamard codes and orthogonal sets generated from cyclic shifts of two-level autocorrelation sequences. This renders all codes in the generated sets with an effective spreading gain. The generation method also encompasses a procedure to generate N-1 sets with low inter-set correlation for application to oversaturated spread spectrum systems.	autocorrelation;code word;fast walsh–hadamard transform;hadamard transform;rendering (computer graphics)	Sujit Jos;Jinesh P.

The proposed boost converter with 1- or 2-stage charge pump has two advantages by changing buffer voltage depending on program data size. First, the proposed boost converter with 2-stage charge pump (proposed circuit) decreases SET/RESET time of ReRAM by 97 % compared with the conventional boost converter with no charge pump (conventional 1) [1]. Second, compared with the conventional boost converter with 1-stage charge pump (conventional 2) [2], the total program time is decreased by 16 % with the proposed circuit when the program data size is as large as 10 sectors (5 kbyte).

Each packet is comprised of exactly one symbol of ciphertext, and hence, the attacker's channel could be viewed as a symbol erasure channel. Information-theoretic cryptanalysis provides key and message equivocations for the cipher in general, and then gives the results as functions of the error-free ciphertext equivocations.

Channel estimation is, however, a critical issue for coherent demodulation. In this paper, a new channel estimator based on neural network with feedback for MIMO-OFDM mobile system is designed and its performance is compared to the least square error (LS), least mean square error (LMS), minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithms and neural network without feedback by using computer simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed system is an effective solution to channel estimation in time varying fast fading channels without any knowledge of channel statistics and noise information.	algorithm;artificial neural network;carrier recovery;channel state information;coherence (physics);computer simulation;frequency divider;least mean squares filter;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;multiplexing;uncompressed video	Muhammet Nuri Seyman;Necmi Taspinar	2012	Intelligent Automation & Soft Computing	10.1080/10798587.2008.10643245	multi-user mimo;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;control theory;channel state information;precoding;artificial neural network;mimo	Mobile	47.14049359908887	78.14485415737467	1479

Previous work on this topic focuses on movement patterns (trajectories with time dimension) of moving objects, rather than spatial shapes (trajectories without time dimension) of their trajectories. In this paper we propose a simple and effective way to compare spatial shapes of moving object trajectories. We introduce a new distance function based on “one way distance” (OWD). Algorithms for evaluating OWD in both continuous (piece wise linear) and discrete (grid representation) cases are developed. An index structure for OWD in grid representation, which guarantees no false dismissals, is also given to improve the efficiency of similarity search. Empirical studies show that OWD out-performs existent methods not only in precision, but also in efficiency. And the results of OWD in continuous case can be approximated by discrete case efficiently.	approximation algorithm;computational complexity theory;computer performance;critical point (network science);database;dynamic time warping;heuristic;ibm notes;image scaling;maxima and minima;piecewise linear continuation;scheduling (computing);search problem;similarity search;surround sound;time complexity	Bin Lin;Jianwen Su	2008	GeoInformatica	10.1007/s10707-007-0027-y	data processing;computer science;machine learning;data mining;database;mathematics;geometry;accuracy and precision;statistics	DB	29.448099917681624	16.5875755609024	1480

176528e36f4478e873605ebc65bc17a5bd82a316	solution of the scalar wave equation over very long distances using nonlinear solitary waves: relation to finite difference methods	acoustics;wave confinement;solitary waves;electromagnetics;eulerian numerical methods;finite difference methods	The linear wave equation represents the basis of many linear electromagnetic and acoustic propagation problems. Features that a computational model must have, to capture large scale realistic effects (for over the horizon or ''OTH'' radar communication, for example), include propagation of short waves with scattering and partial absorption by complex topography. For these reasons, it is not feasible to use Green's Function or any simple integral method, which neglects these intermediate effects and requires a known propagation function between source and observer. In this paper, we describe a new method for propagating such short waves over long distances, including intersecting scattered waves. The new method appears to be much simpler than conventional high frequency schemes: Lagrangian ''particle'' based approaches, such as ''ray tracing'' become very complex in 3-D, especially for waves that may be expanding, or even intersecting. The other high frequency scheme in common use, the Eikonal, also has difficulty with intersecting waves. Our approach, based on nonlinear solitary waves concentrated about centroid surfaces of physical wave features, is related to that of Whitham [1], which involves solving wave fronts propagating on characteristics. Then, the evolving electromagnetic (or acoustic) field can be approximated as a collection of propagating co-dimension one surfaces (for example, 2-D surfaces in three dimensions). This approach involves solving propagation equations discretely on an Eulerian grid to approximate the linear wave equation. However, to propagate short waves over long distances, conventional Eulerian numerical methods, which attempt to resolve the structure of each wave, require far too many grid cells and are not feasible on current or foreseeable computers. Instead, we employ an ''extended'' wave equation that captures the important features of the propagating waves. This method is first formulated at the partial differential equation (PDE) level, as a wave equation with an added ''confining'' term that involves both a positive and a negative dissipation. Once we have the stable PDE, the discrete formulation is simply a multidimensional PDE with (stable) perturbations caused by the discretization. The resulting discrete solution can then be low order and very simple and yet remain stable over arbitrarily long times. When discretized and solved on an Eulerian grid, this new method allows far coarser grids than required by conventional resolution considerations, while still accounting for the effects of varying atmospheric and topographic features. An important point is that the new method is in the same form as conventional discrete wave equation methods. However, the conventional solution eventually decays, and only the ''intermediate asymptotic'' solution can be used. Simply by adding an extra term, we show that a nontrivial true asymptotic solution can be obtained. A similar solitary wave based approach has been used successfully in a different problem (involving ''Vorticity Confinement''), for a number of years.	finite difference method;nonlinear system	John Steinhoff;Subhashini Chitta	2012	J.

The network has been dimensioned using promising candidate sensor applications that were chosen based on a set of key criteria including safety, security, and timing-criticality and commercial viability. An extensive set of experiments were carried out to determine characteristics, feasibility and ease of integration of such a network into the vehicle electrical system. A network of 10 node positions and 3 possible gateway positions was used as a reference platform. Initial results indicate that for truck variants with up to 5 axles, there is near universal coverage using 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 radios with link budgets above 100 dB. Links between sensors and all gateway positions have been found to support above 90% packet reception rates at received signal strengths of about -70 dBm, with gateway positions in the central and rear chassis areas performing best. Current estimates are that such a network is robust enough to support sensors of low safety, security and timing criticality.	chassis;criticality matrix;dbm;experiment;network packet;reference design;sensor web;transponder timing	Dhasarathy Parthasarathy;Russ Whiton;Jonas Hagerskans;Tomas Gustafsson	2016	2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)	10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733554	embedded system;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;logic gate;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;wireless;computer network	Mobile	21.68426724764151	78.48919700600494	1486

In this article, we identify basic components, fundamental trade-offs, and practical constraints in opportunistic spectrum access. We introduce a decision-theoretic framework based on the theory of partially observable Markov decision processes. This framework allows us to systematically tackle the optimal integrated design and quantitatively characterize the interaction between signal processing for opportunity identification and networking for opportunity exploitation.

The system provides a flexible space scenario for multi-service network with guaranteed quality of service (QoS).

Introduction Additive noise filtering is a common problem in many experimental situations. Sometimes happens however that what matters is to understand if a signal is present or not in the observations. The specific shape of the signal is not relevant. Moreover sometimes it is not possible tomake assumptions on the statistical distribution of the noise. The problem consists then in characterizing the noisew.r. to any possible signal with the only constraint that the noise is additive. In the following we assume that the noise can be represented by a discrete time, complex valued, stationary process such that every finite set of random variables of the process has a multivariate spherical distribution centered in zero. In the limit case in which this process reduces to a single complex random variable this is equivalent to considering a couple of real random variables with bivariate spherical distribution. As the noise is additive when a signal is present the data have the same multivariate spherical distribution centered on the signal. We remember that this assumption generalizes to dimension larger than one the natural assumption that the noise should have a symmetric distribution w.r. to zero i.e. negative values have the same distribution as positive ones. Exchangeability is implied by sphericity, therefore every finite set of random variables of the noise process has the same distribution of a permutation of its components. This seems a natural requirement for the noise. However sphericity implies more geometric structure. In fact e.g. the distribution of every n-dimensional set of random variables of a spherical process is invariant by rotation in the n-dimensional Euclidean space of random variables. This too seems a natural property of the noise. Moreover adding more noise should not modify its statistical distribution. Therefore the radial density of the multivariate spherical distribution should be an α-stable density. An obvious tool for solving the signal detection problem described above consists in performing a one-sample multivariate location test H0: the observed process is centered in zero, against H1: the observed process is not centered in zero. Many methods exist to solve this problem. In the specific case when the noise distribution is Gaussian, Hotelling’s test is the optimal one [13]. Otherwise nonparametric tests have been developedwhich can be classified into threemain groups.

Barone / Journal of Multivariate Analysis 144 (2016) 189–199 To the first group belongmethods based onmarginal signs and ranks [20] but are not invariantw.r. to affine transformations. The second group is related with spatial signs and ranks [15,12,11], and [17] for a review. The tests in this group are affine invariant. Methods in the third group are affine invariant and are based on the concept of interdirections [21,19]. In [9] it was proved that it is possible to devise tests, based on interdirections and ranks of the length of the residual vectors, that are affine invariant and exhibit local asymptotic optimality a la Le Cam if the joint density of the observations is elliptically symmetric and the radial density satisfies some assumptions. Unfortunately these assumptions under theα-stability hypothesis are not valid but in some specific cases. The idea is then to transform the original sample in order to be able to make this check [2]. More specifically, given m complex i.i.d. n-variate observations, each of them can be replaced by a transformed one by considering Padé approximants of orders [n/2 − 1, n/2] if n is even and of orders [(n − 1)/2, (n − 1)/2] if n is odd of the Z-transform of the n components. Four statistics are then computed: poles, zeros, normalized residuals at the poles and normalized residuals at the zeros in the following called Padé parameters. It turns out that all these quantities are functions of the generalized eigenvalues and eigenvectors of two pencils of randomHankel matrices. It is proved that, under H0, these statistics are universal, i.e. their distribution does not depend on the specific spherical distribution of the observations. Therefore the α-stable radial density can be replaced by a Gaussian one. Moreover, in the specific case of n = 2, it is proved that the pole statistic satisfies the hypotheses required in [9]. A van der Waerden type optimal test can then be used on this parameter. A Monte Carlo experiment shows that the same test applied to the other Padé parameters has lower power and the same is true for the same test applied to the original data and for the Hotelling test applied to the original data. Therefore it seems useless to check the hypotheses required in [9] for the other Padé parameters and the original data. We notice that the Chernoff and Savage’s result [9, Th. 6] comparing the van der Waerden type test and the Hotelling one on the original data does not hold in general for α-stable data. Finally it is proved that the poles statistic can be used to define a new optimal test a la Le Cam, whose asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) w.r. to the van der Waerden type test when applied to poles data is larger than one. A Monte Carlo experiment confirms these results stressing that the advantages of the new test applied to the poles data is larger for small values of α and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 the statistics are defined and their universality properties are assessed. In Section 2 the sphericity of the statistics is proved and the location tests are described. In Section 3 some simulation results are reported and in the last one two examples of application of the proposed statistic are considered and the results are compared to that reported in the literature for several location tests applied to the same datasets. 1. Universality properties Let us denote random quantities by bold characters and assume that the complex-valued discrete process {a}k, k ∈ N , representing the signal plus white noise, is such that all finite sets of {a}k have an elliptically symmetric distribution. More precisely, if a = [a0, . . . , an−1], we assume that ∀n = 2p, ã = {R(a), I(a)} has an elliptical distribution with a density given by (see e.g. [7]) G(a; s, Σ, g) = Γ (n)∥a∥ s,Σ g(∥a∥s,Σ )/(2π n) (1) where g(·) is the density of ∥a∥s,Σ and ∥a∥s,Σ =  (a − s)⊤Σ−1(a − s) 1/2 , s ∈ R2n, Σ > 0 ∈ R2n×2n. Equivalently we can assume that ã d = s + Σ1/2e where s represents the signal and e represents the scaled noise centered in zero with spherical distribution.

However, the Rician fading model is suitable for microcellular mobile systems or line of sight mode of WiMAX. In this paper, the training based channel estimation (TBCE) scheme in the spatially correlated Rician flat fading MIMO channels is investigated. First, the least squares (LS) channel estimator is probed. Simulation results show that the Rice factor has no effect on the performance of this estimator. Then, a new linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) technique, appropriate for Rician fading channels, is proposed. The optimal choice of training sequences with mean square error (MSE) criteria is investigated for these estimators. Analytical and numerical results show that the performance of proposed estimator in the Rician channel model compared with Rayleigh one is much better. It is illustrated that when the channel Rice factor and/or the correlation coefficient increase, the performance of the proposed estimator significantly improves.	channel (communications);channel state information;coefficient;least squares;mimo;mean squared error;numerical analysis;rayleigh–ritz method;rice's theorem;simulation	Hamid Nooralizadeh;Shahriar Shirvani Moghaddam	2010	IJCNS	10.4236/ijcns.2010.312131	telecommunications;rician fading;rayleigh fading;channel state information;statistics;mimo	Mobile	39.22974741777858	79.31128782651184	1510

Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce power consumption: 55% of daily power savings, upto 73% of power savings during low traffic periods, and the minimum 23% of power savings even during high traffic periods. Our MDP algorithms find desired optimal policies to deactivate unnecessary base stations without sacrificing network performances.	algorithm;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);iteration;markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;mobile phone;network performance;optimization problem;organizing (structure);overhead (computing);performance;performance per watt;self-organization;simulation;switch;unix time	Junhyuk Kim;Peng Yong Kong;Nah-Oak Song;June-Koo Kevin Rhee;Saleh Al-Araji	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952722	simulation;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;base station;operating system;wireless network;mathematical model;mobile computing;computer network	Metrics	24.771499481916	93.13968046415644	1513

Finding this optimal submatrix is what renders the problem NP-hard. In this paper, we prove that, if the matrix is positive semidefinite and its rank is constant, then its sparse principal component is polynomially computable. Our proof utilizes the auxiliary unit vector technique that has been recently developed to identify problems that are polynomially solvable. In addition, we use this technique to design an algorithm which, for any sparsity value, computes the sparse principal component with complexity O(ND+1), where N and D are the matrix size and rank, respectively. Our algorithm is fully parallelizable and memory efficient.	algorithm;computable function;computation;decision problem;np-hardness;polynomial;principal component analysis;rendering (computer graphics);sparse matrix;the matrix	Megasthenis Asteris;Dimitris S.

Multiple antennas or multiple input multiple output (MIMO)-based systems have the potential for improving the capacity of these networks manifolds. However, unique physical layer characteristics associated with MIMO-based systems require joint design among physical layer and upper layers. In this paper, we investigate the problem of jointly optimizing routing and stream control scheduling in a MIMO-based WMN, where multiple antennas are exploited to increase the capacity via spatial reuse (SR) and/or spatial multiplexing (SM). A column generation (CG) method is used to efficiently solved the problem. For the difficult pricing problem that arises in the CG procedure, we propose a computationally efficient heuristic algorithm. A combination of dual decomposition and gradient-based methods are used to decouple the network layer and link layer operations. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;column generation;conjugate gradient method;end-to-end principle;heuristic (computer science);internet access;internet backbone;lagrangian relaxation;last mile;mimo;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;newton's method;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;spatial multiplexing;throughput;wireless mesh network	Matadeen Bansal;Aditya Trivedi	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214031	column generation;wireless mesh network;heuristic;routing;link layer;multi-user mimo;cost-effectiveness analysis;mimo-ofdm;computer science;antenna;distributed computing;interference;scheduling;spatial multiplexing;physical layer;multiplexing;computer network;mimo	Mobile	33.778358524760414	93.25733577663587	1544

This paper proposes a suitable exponential type transform and applies it to the commonly-used total variation model to achieve implicitly constrained solution (positivity at its lower bound and a prescribed intensity value at the upper bound). Further to establish convergence, a convex model is proposed through a relaxation of the transformed functional. Numerical algorithms are presented to solve the resulting non-linear partial differential equations. Test results show that the proposed method is competitive when compared with existing methods in simple cases and more superior in other cases.	algorithm;circuit restoration;deblurring;linear programming relaxation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;time complexity;variational principle	Bryan Michael Williams;Ke Chen;Simon Peter Harding	2014	Numerical Algorithms	10.1007/s11075-014-9904-2	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;geometry;total variation;algorithm;statistics;algebra	AI	75.21352861868836	25.46224730673132	1545

The time-dependent Ginzburg–Landau model which describes the phase transitions taking place in superconductors is a coupled system of nonlinear parabolic equations. It is discretized semi-implicitly in time and in space via continuous piecewise linear finite elements. A posteriori error estimates are derived for the L∞L2 norm by studying a dual problem of the linearization of the original system, other than the dual of error equations. Numerical simulations are included which illustrate the reliability of the estimators and the flexibility of the proposed adaptive method.	discretization;duality (optimization);dynamical system;error detection and correction;finite element method;galerkin method;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;numerical linear algebra;parabolic antenna;piecewise linear continuation;semiconductor industry;simulation	Zhiming Chen;Shibin Dai	2001	SIAM J.

These kinds of problems often occur in laminar boundary layer with temperature dependent viscosity. Runge-Kutta method incorporating with optimization techniques is used to solve the problem. First, the semi-infinite interval is transformed into a finite interval. Second, by converting the boundary value problem, with some initial and distributed unknowns, into an optimization problem, solving the original problem is limited to solving a multiobjective optimization problem. Third, we use shooting-Newton’s method for solving this optimization problem. It is shown that the Falkner-Skan problem with constant surface temperature, that arise during the solution for the laminar forced convection heat transfer from wedges to flow, can be solved accurately and simultaneously by this strategy. Numerical results for different values of wedge angle and Prandtl number are presented, which are in good agreement with some of the successful provided solutions in the literature.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;newton;newton's method;numerical method;open dynamics engine;optimization problem;pseudorandom number generator;runge–kutta methods;semiconductor industry;shooting method	R.

Since a packet in overlay multicasting is transmitted via unicast routing between the end hosts, the same packet can be sent over a link multiple times, and thus the main challenge in overlay multicasting is organizing the multicast delivery trees to minimize bandwidth consumption. In this paper, we present a formal analysis of the bandwidth efficiency of overlay multicasting using a simple tree construction algorithm called BestRelay. Our analytical result shows that the bandwidth consumption of overlay multicast routing can be bounded by twice that of optimal IP multicasting.

However, the piggyback scheme may cause the decrease of the channel efficiency and the increase of the frame transmission delay for other stations when any station has the low transmission rate and the control frame has the global control information such as the channel reservation time. It is similar to the anomaly phenomenon in the network which supports the multi-rate transmission. In this paper, we define this phenomenon as """"the piggyback problem at low physical transmission rate"""" and evaluate the effect of this problem with respect to the physical transmission rate and the normalized traffic load. Then, we propose the delay-based piggyback algorithm which decides to use the piggyback scheme for a control frame based on the delay efficiency in IEEE 802.11e HCCA.

In this scheme, CR units try to exploit the primary networks' unused bands by establishing links with neighbouring CRs using those bands. Inspired by human brain, the CRs extract and memorize the activity patterns of the primary network and other CRs and create temporal channel assignments on sub-bands with no recent primary user activities using a self-organizing maps (SOM) technique. The proposed scheme is decentralized and employs a simple learning rule with low complexity and minimal memory requirements. The simulation results show that SO-DSM significantly decreases the probability of collision with primary users and also probability of CR link interruption.	cognition;cognitive radio;hoc (programming language);interrupt;learning rule;organizing (structure);requirement;self-organization;self-organizing map;simulation	Farhad Khozeimeh;Simon Haykin	2012	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2012.081312.111538	hebbian theory;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer network	Mobile	19.52798460730851	94.08785339476037	1600

At the same time, industry is exploring many new memory technologies that require new manufacturing processes. In such challenging fabrication regimes, parameter variation (PV) and yield will be important problems. While many recent bodies of work have targeted PV in processors, few have targeted PV in the memory system. Mitigation techniques have either focused on refresh, or have focused on inter-die variation. In this work, with empirical measurements, we first show that PV and specifically intra-die PV is indeed a real phenomenon in modern DRAM chips. We show that this intra-die PV can impact timing parameters for different banks within a DRAM chip. In response to growing PV, memory timing parameters will likely be set very conservatively to accommodate the worst case. To overcome these worst-case limitations, we propose the design of a reconfigurable memory module that detects PV in the field and organizes the memory system into fast/slow regions. This requires changes to the memory controller and to buffer chips on DIMMs. Further, OS migration policies can move frequently accessed pages to the fast regions. This overall approach not only improves performance and energy, it also provides a configurable platform for systems that can tolerate errors or approximation. The proposed system yields an average performance improvement of 12.6% in DRAM systems, and 25.5% in NVM systems.	approximation;best, worst and average case;central processing unit;dimm;dynamic random-access memory;image scaling;memory controller;memory module;memory timings;non-volatile memory;operating system;page view	Meysam Taassori;Ali Shafiee;Rajeev Balasubramonian	2016	2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)	10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753283	embedded system;interleaved memory;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;operating system;registered memory;field-programmable gate array	EDA	5.468285991323495	59.598803779093636	1602

To obtain the position information of the neighbors, many geographic routing protocols assume that each node exchange periodically its own position information with its neighbors. However, these periodically position exchanges in regions without packet forwarding make nodes consume unnecessary energy. In addition, given that the nodes have mobility, when a node forwards a packet, the position information of its neighbor nodes may be invalid. Hence, in these mobile networks, it is more efficient that a mobile node collects the position information of its neighbors when it needs to forward a packet. Because every sender node in geographic routing also selects the nearest neighbor node to the destination node as the receiver node, obtaining the position information of only closer neighbor nodes to the destination node can save more wireless resources than obtaining that of all neighbor nodes. In large-scale networks, because many wireless collisions can happen due to position exchanges of many neighbor nodes, they should share limited wireless resources. Therefore, we propose a mechanism to solve these issues of geographic routing in large-scale mobile networks. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism has better performance than the existing geographic routing protocols.	geographic routing;hoc (programming language);network packet;port forwarding;scalability;simulation	Euisin Lee;Soochang Park;Hosung Park;Jeongchul Lee;Sang Ha Kim	2009	2009 International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized Systems	10.1109/ISADS.2009.5207340	routing;exposed node problem;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;distributed computing;mobile computing;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	3.651415388781788	81.62485022740158	1606

Its core idea is to trade off the accuracy of an application with its power consumption. It hereby relies on the ability of many applications and the human perception to accept or not to notice minor quality degradations of a computed result. A reduction of the precision of an application, and hence the power consumption, can be reached by many techniques and on many levels of abstraction. This work focuses on the approximation of sequential integrated circuits by aggressively scaling the supply voltage of the logic gates of a circuit, hence accepting timing violations. Compared to previous work, the approach presented in this work is a generic approach that can be automatically applied to any digital circuit. We are achieving this by scaling each timing path of a timing endpoint individually. In order to do so, we are first estimating at which supply voltage which timing path is failing. Then we are estimating the resulting error probability, for which we developed a simple and fast method that allows us to conservatively assess it. Applied to an exemplary benchmark circuit, the presented approach allowed us to save up to 27% of the power, without having a major degradation of the quality. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate, using the presented methodology, that only very few over-scaled voltage domains can be sufficient to substantially decrease the power consumption.	approximate computing;approximation;benchmark (computing);communication endpoint;digital electronics;elegant degradation;failure;image scaling;integrated circuit;logic gate;principle of abstraction;simulation;voltage regulator module	David May;Walter Stechele	2016	2016 International Conference on Design and Technology of Integrated Systems in Nanoscale Era (DTIS)	10.1109/DTIS.2016.7483887	electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;pass transistor logic;static timing analysis;algorithm	EDA	19.11418799902807	57.761696507991566	1608

The main advantages of the selected converter are its voltage step up and step down properties, high efficiency, and low input and output current ripples. This allows it to be positioned in the different FC hybrid system localizations with a suitable design of its control. Moreover, having the same module for all the system converters simplifies the design and construction tasks.

The proposed protocol is shown to outperform all the existing algorithms based on either NDMA or MPR. Additionally, the protocol formulation provides an important generalization of the model used for the analysis of solutions in these three fields. Unlike conventional NDMA protocols, in which all the colliding users are requested to immediately retransmit in the next time-slot, our proposed algorithm calculates the optimum set of users allowed to retransmit at each one of the following time-slots. The optimization is based on the previous collected transmissions and on the MPR and source separation (SS) probabilities, thus maximizing throughput and minimizing access-delay. Two possible suboptimal algorithms with simplified feedback assumption and hence suitable for distributed resolution are further derived from the original algorithm: an enhanced version of NDMA assisted by MPR and a fair splitting tree algorithm assisted by MPR and SS. The capacity/stability region of the protocol for several system configurations with two active users is employed to assess the benefits of the proposed algorithms.	algorithm;hash table;list of algorithms;mathematical optimization;minkowski portal refinement;phy (chip);random access;retransmission (data networks);source separation;throughput	Ramiro Sámano-Robles;Mounir Ghogho;Desmond C.

Its applicability is extremely relevant in various areas of science, as exemplified in [2], with digital signal processing (DSP) as the most notable one. After teaching this topic for many years, I have noted that neither young DSP students nor experienced researchers have perceived several interesting aspects of the DWT from a practical point of view. Thus, the objective of this article is to construe such relevant aspects, providing useful tips to calculate the transform in one (1-D) and two (2-D) dimensions. The entire discussion is also valid to the discrete wavelet-packet transform (DWPT), which extends the decomposition carried out by the DWT so that a finer time-frequency analysis takes place, and also to the discrete shapelet transform (DST) [3], which extends the properties of the DWT and DWPT so that a joint time-frequency-shape signal analysis becomes possible.	digital signal processing;discrete wavelet transform;fast fourier transform;frequency analysis;time–frequency analysis;wavelet packet decomposition	Rodrigo Capobianco Guido	2015	IEEE Signal Processing Magazine	10.1109/MSP.2014.2368586	wavelet;speech recognition;second-generation wavelet transform;computer science;theoretical computer science;wavelet packet decomposition;stationary wavelet transform;algorithm	Theory	55.0031900094551	18.854012273105063	1614

The peak-to-average ratio (PAR) reduction of the multiple carrier mixed signal, namely CFR, has been an issue in order to convey the benefit of using low-cost power amplifiers. The simple final clipping method (SFCM) as a conventional method has been widely utilized due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, the SFCM degrades the adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) characteristic as well as the signal quality indicated by either the error vector magnitude (EVM) or the peak code domain error (PCDE). Conventionally, in order to alleviate this undesired deterioration, extra channel filtering and signal quality enhancement followed by CFR might be processed in an open-loop style. Alternatively, to perform CFR by maintaining the PAR as low as possible subject to satisfying the prescribed ACLR and EVM/PCDE performance, this paper introduces the prediction filter dependent peak reduction (PFDPR) process collaboratively working with dynamic waterfilling-based code domain compensation (DWCDC). To verify the superiority of the proposed CFR algorithm, tentative simulations are conducted while maintaining the rules of legitimate W-CDMA base station test specifications.

36d28dd7fdc1a62f40c7771080fd08699e60891d	a multi-agent neural network for dynamic frequency reuse in lte networks		Fractional Frequency Reuse techniques can be employed to address interference in mobile networks, improving throughput for edge users. There is a tradeoff between the coverage and overall throughput achievable, as interference avoidance techniques lead to a loss in a cellu0027s overall throughput, with spectrum efficiency decreasing with the fencing off of orthogonal resources. In this paper we propose MANN, a dynamic multiagent frequency reuse scheme, where individual agents in charge of cells control their configurations based on input from neural networks. The agentsu0027 decisions are partially influenced by a coordinator agent, which attempts to maximise a global metric of the network (e.g., cell-edge performance). Each agent uses a neural network to estimate the best action (i.e., cell configuration) for its current environment setup, and attempts to maximise in turn a local metric, subject to the constraint imposed by the coordinator agent. Results show that our solution provides improved performance for edge users, increasing the throughput of the bottom 5% of users by 22%, while retaining 95% of a networku0027s overall throughput from the full frequency reuse case. Furthermore, we show how our method improves on static fractional frequency reuse schemes.	agent-based model;artificial neural network;compaq lte;interference (communication);spectral efficiency;throughput;turned a	Andrei Marinescu;Irene Macaluso;Luiz A.

In this article, the focus is on higher-order accurate finite difference schemes for the wave equation in any number of spatial dimensions. In particular, two-step schemes (which operate over three time levels) are studied. A novel approach to the construction of schemes exhibiting both isotropy and accuracy is presented using modified equation techniques, and allowing for the specification of precise stencils of operation for the scheme, and thus direct control over stencil size and thus operation counts per time step. Both implicit and explicit schemes are presented, as well as parameterised families of such schemes under conditions specifying the order of isotropy and accuracy. Such conditions are framed in terms of a set of coupled constraints which are nonlinear in general, but linear for a fixed Courant number. Depending on the particular choice of stencils, it is often possible to develop schemes for which the traditional Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition is exceeded. A wide variety of families of such schemes is presented in one, two and three spatial dimensions, and accompanied by illustrations of numerical dispersion as well as convergence results confirming higher-order accuracy up to eighth order.	finite difference method	Stefan Bilbao;Brian Hamilton	2018	J.

But the major challenges of the wireless acoustic signal compressed sampling are their property of the real time sampling and their constraint of the limited communication resource.

Based on an existing nonlinear flow solver, the design of efficient and straightforward procedures to access these operators is thus highly desirable. In the case of compressible solvers, the use of high-order numerical schemes combined with complicated governing equations makes the derivation of efficient procedures a challenging and often tedious undertaking. In this work, a novel technique for the evaluation of the direct and adjoint operators directly from compressible flow solvers is presented and extended to include nonlinear differentiation schemes and turbulence models. The application to the incompressible counterpart is also discussed. The presented method requires minimal additional programming effort and automatically takes into account subsequent modifications in the governing equations and boundary conditions. The introduced methodology is demonstrated on existing numerical codes, and direct and adjoint global modes are calculated for three typical flow configurations. Implementation issues and the performance measures are also discussed. The proposed algorithm presents an easy-to-implement and efficient technique to extract valuable information for the quantitative analysis of complex flows.		Miguel Fosas de Pando;Denis Sipp;Peter J.

The paper introduces a family of scheduling problems called fault-tolerant programs scheduling. Since, the discussed problems are, in general, computationally difficult, a challenge is to find effective scheduling procedures. Several evolution-based algorithms solving three basic kinds of fault-tolerant programs scheduling problems have been proposed. The problems involve scheduling multiple variant or multiple processor tasks on multiple, identical processors, under time constraints. To validate the algorithms computational experiment has been conducted. Experimental results show that evolution based algorithms produce satisfactory to good solutions in a reasonable time. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract The next generation wireless networks are envisioned to deal with the expected thousandfold increase in total mobile broadband data and the hundred-fold increase in connected devices. In order to provide higher data rates, improved endto-end performance, low latency, and low energy consumption at low cost per transmission, the fifth generation (5G) systems are required to overcome various handicaps of current cellular networks and wireless links. One of the key handicaps of 5G systems is the performance degradation of the communication link, due to the use of low-cost transceiver in high data rate. Motivated by this in this paper, we discuss the impact of transceiver front-end hardware imperfections on the spectrum sensing performance of cognitive radios.	cognitive radio;data rate units;elegant degradation;fifth generation computer;information leakage;radio frequency;spectral leakage;transceiver;uncompressed video	Alexandros-Apostolos A.

In this paper, we propose a mechanism that provides differentiated services for the IEEE 802.15.4 sensor networks to improve the total throughput and the fairness of the channel. To provide differentiated services for each and every device, our mechanism adds different sizes of backoff period according to the size of packet that is generated by the device. The mathematical model based on the discrete-time Markov chain is presented and is analyzed to measure the performances of the proposed mechanism. Simulation results are also given to verify the accuracy of the analytical model. Finally, the analytical results show the improvement in the throughput and the fairness of the network which applies our mechanism.	backoff;computer simulation;differentiated service;differentiated services;fairness measure;markov chain;mathematical model;network packet;performance;sensor;throughput	Tae-Yoon Kim;Sung-Kwan Youm;Eui-Jik Kim;Chul-Hee Kang	2006		10.1007/11946441_25	home automation;markov chain;discrete time and continuous time;real-time computing;simulation;systems modeling;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;differentiated service;computer science;mathematical model;parallel algorithm;equity;sensor array;statistics	Mobile	1.6053227559906316	102.2152143155446	1667

After recalling the principle of SCS we highlight its secure implementations regarding the Watermarked contents Only Attack, and we also describe the relations between the alphabet size and the secure embedding parameters. Since the gap between the achievable rates of secure-SCS and SCS is important for low Watermark to Noise Ratios (WNR) regimes, we introduce Soft-SCS, a scheme which enables to achieve security by matching a given distribution of watermarked content while minimizing the embedding distortion. The embedding is given by the optimal transport and the distortion is computed using the transportation theory. Contrary to SCS, the distribution of watermarked contents is not piecewise uniform of width (1-α)∆, but contains affine portions parametrized by a new embedding parameter β used to maximize the robusness of Soft-SCS. As a consequence, the achievable rates of Soft-SCS for low WNR regimes for both its secure and robust implementations are higher than for SCS. Our conclusions are that (1) the loss of performance between the secure and robust implementations of Soft-SCS for WNR regimes smaller than 0 dB is negligible and (2) the robust implementation of Soft-SCS is equal to SCS for WNR regimes over 0 dB.	additive white gaussian noise;digital watermarking;distortion;high-water mark (computer security);scalar processor;transportation theory (mathematics);watermark (data file)	Patrick Bas	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24178-9_15	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Crypto	34.51114330701082	65.1114430213483	1670

However, the benefits and flexible structure of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based two-way relay systems is much less exploited. Moreover, most of existing works have not considered quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning for two-way relaying. In this paper, we consider the OFDM-based bidirectional transmission where a pair of users exchange information via the assistance of a decode-and-forward (DF) relay. Each user can communicate with the other via three transmission modes: direct transmission, one-way relaying, and two-way relaying. We jointly optimize the transmission policies, including power allocation, transmission mode selection, and subcarrier assignment in order to maximize the weighted sum rates of the two users with diverse QoS guarantees. This is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem. By using the dual method, we efficiently solve the problem in an asymptotically optimal manner. Simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation scheme can substantially improve system performance compared with conventional schemes.

We present a new 5 4 -approximation algorithm for 2EC for subcubic bridgeless multigraphs, improving upon the current best approximation ratio of 5 4 + . Our algorithm involves an elegant new method based on circulations which we feel has potential to be more broadly applied. We also study the closely related integrality gap problem, i.e.the worst case ratio between the integer linear program for 2EC and its linear programming relaxation, both theoretically and computationally. We show this gap is at most 5 4 for subcubic bridgeless multigraphs, and is at most 9 8 for all subcubic bridgeless graphs with up to 16 nodes. Moreover, we present a family of graphs that demonstrate the integrality gap for 2EC is at least 8 7 , even when restricted to subcubic bridgeless graphs. This represents an improvement over the previous best known bound of 9 8 .		Sylvia C.

Previously we have demonstrated how registers, logic gates and logic circuits can be implemented, unconventionally, with a biocompatible molecular switch, NitroBIPS, embedded in a polymer matrix. NitroBIPS and related molecules have been shown elsewhere to be capable of modifying many biological processes in a manner that is dependent on its molecular form. Thus, one possible application of this type of unconventional computing is to embed computational processes into biological systems. Here we expand on our earlier proof-of-principle work and demonstrate that universal computation can be implemented using NitroBIPS. We have previously shown that spatially localised computational elements, including registers and logic gates, can be produced. We explain how parallel registers can be implemented, then demonstrate an application of parallel registers in the form of Turing machine tapes, and demonstrate both parallel registers and logic circuits in the form of elementary cellular automata. The Turing machines and elementary cellular automata utilise the same samples and same hardware to implement their registers, logic gates and logic circuits; and both represent examples of universal computing paradigms. This shows that homogenous photochromic computational devices can be dynamically repurposed without invasive reconfiguration. The result represents an important, necessary step towards demonstrating the general feasibility of interfacial computation embedded in biological systems or other unconventional materials and environments.	automata theory;biological system;biomedical tape;computation (action);elementary cellular automaton;embedded system;embedding;logic gate;polymer;processor register;unconventional computing;universal turing machine	Jack C.

Under this structural representation of the elements some graph matching problems need a common labeling between the vertices of a set of graphs. Computing this common labeling is a NP-Complete problem. Nevertheless, some methodologies have been presented which obtain a sub-optimal solution in polynomial time. The drawback of these methods is that they rely on pairwise labeling computations, causing the methodologies not to consider the global information during the entire process. To solve this problem, we present a methodology which generates the common labeling by matching all graph nodes to a virtual node set. The method has been tested using three independent datasets, one synthetic and two real. Experimental results show that the presented method obtains better performance than the most popular common labeling algorithm with the same computational cost.	algorithm;assignment problem;matching (graph theory)	Albert Solé-Ribalta;Francesc Serratosa	2013	IJPRAI	10.1142/S0218001413500018	graph power;mathematical optimization;factor-critical graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;independent set;graph bandwidth;edge-graceful labeling;bipartite graph;null graph;graph property;graph labeling;clique-width;comparability graph;mathematics;voltage graph;graph;complement graph;matching;connected-component labeling	EDA	19.49799553119346	20.623398545174553	1701

Post fabrication annealings are performed on FDSOI transistors to mimic the thermal budget associated to top layer processing. Degradation of the silicide for thermal treatments beyond 400°C is identified as the main responsible for performance degradation for PMOS devices. For the NMOS transistors, arsenic (As) and phosphorus (P) dopants deactivation adds up to this effect. By optimizing both the n-type extension implantations and the bottom silicide process, thermal stability of FDSOI can be extended to allow relaxing upwards the thermal budget authorized for top transistors processing.	authorization;dopant;elegant degradation;monolithic kernel;nmos logic;pmos logic;silicon on insulator;transistor	Claire Fenouillet-Béranger;Bernard Previtali;Perrine Batude;F.

Each anomalous component of the system incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Different anomalous components may incur different costs depending on their criticality to the system. Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each given time. The observations from a probed component are realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. The objective is a probing strategy that minimizes the total expected cost, incurred by all the components during the detection process, under reliability constraints. We consider both independent and exclusive models. In the former, each component can be abnormal with a certain probability independent of other components. In the latter, one and only one component is abnormal. We develop optimal index policies under both models. The proposed index policies apply to a more general case where a subset (more than one) of the components can be probed simultaneously. The problem under study also finds applications in spectrum scanning in cognitive radio networks and event detection in sensor networks.	anomaly detection;cognitive radio;self-organized criticality;software bug	Kobi Cohen;Qing Zhao;Ananthram Swami	2014	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2014.2332982	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;hypothesis;network architecture;computer science;theoretical computer science;sequential analysis;network security;decoupling;reliability;mathematics;markov process;fault detection and isolation;packet switching;wireless;statistics	Embedded	25.171619543395916	68.64149780321029	1709

In this paper, we present a dedicated load/store unit and its implementation which cooperates with the previously proposed memcpy hardware accelerator and cache to ensure that data becomes available in the cache. Experimental results, using synthetic benchmarks, show that the load/store unit in conjunction with the memcpy hardware accelerator is capable of reducing the memcpy latencies by 85% (when the data is not present in the cache) compared to a highly optimized, hand-coded in assembly software solution.	c string handling;hardware acceleration;microprocessor;speedup;synthetic intelligence	Stamatis Vassiliadis;Filipa Duarte;Stephan Wong	2007	2007 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications	10.1109/FPL.2007.4380711	embedded system;parallel computing;hardware acceleration;computer science;operating system	EDA	-3.4567071592816765	48.55637979794381	1714
d7d1bfd55973cef5fd93d4398cf997e584d75e69	distributed algorithms for planar networks ii: low-congestion shortcuts, mst, and min-cut		This paper introduces the concept of low-congestion shortcuts for (near-)planar networks, and demonstrates their power by using them to obtain near-optimal distributed algorithms for problems such as Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) or Minimum Cut, in planar networks. Consider a graph G = (V,E) and a partitioning of V into subsets of nodes S1, . . . , SN , each inducing a connected subgraph G[Si]. We define an α-congestion shortcut with dilation β to be a set of subgraphs H1, . . . , HN ⊆ G, one for each subset Si, such that 1. For each i ∈ [1, N ], the diameter of the subgraph G[Si] +Hi is at most β. 2. For each edge e ∈ E, the number of subgraphs G[Si] + Hi containing e is at most α. We prove that any partition of a D-diameter planar graph into individually-connected parts admits an O(D logD)congestion shortcut with dilation O(D logD), and we also present a distributed construction of it in Õ(D) rounds. We moreover prove these parameters to be near-optimal; i.e., there are instances in which, unavoidably, max{α, β} = Ω(D logD log logD ). Finally, we use low-congestion shortcuts, and their efficient distributed construction, to derive Õ(D)-round distributed algorithms for MST and Min-Cut, in planar networks. This complexity nearly matches the trivial lower bound of Ω(D). We remark that this is the first result bypassing the well-known Ω̃(D+ √ n) existential lower bound of general graphs (see Peleg and Rubinovich [FOCS’99]; Elkin [STOC’04]; and Das Sarma et al. [STOC’11]) in a family of graphs of interest.	apollonian network;diameter (protocol);dilation (morphology);distributed algorithm;graph (discrete mathematics);keyboard shortcut;maxima and minima;minimum cut;minimum spanning tree;network congestion;planar graph;whole earth 'lectronic link	Mohsen Ghaffari;Bernhard Haeupler	2016			mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	24.828622648463163	22.209742582845536	1715
38c97c4c3cb3f1fe47caf7c85764acf709459d89	global convergence of unmodified 3-block admm for a class of convex minimization problems		The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been successfully applied to solve structured convex optimization problems due to its superior practical performance. The convergence properties of the 2-block ADMM have been studied extensively in the literature. Specifically, it has been proven that the 2-block ADMM globally converges for any penalty parameter γ > 0. In this sense, the 2-block ADMM allows the parameter to be free, i.e., there is no need to restrict the value for the parameter when implementing this algorithm in order to ensure convergence. However, for the 3-block ADMM, Chen et al. [4] recently constructed a counter-example showing that it can diverge if no further condition is imposed. The existing results on studying further sufficient conditions on guaranteeing the convergence of the 3-block ADMM usually require γ to be smaller than a certain bound, which is usually either difficult to compute or too small to make it a practical algorithm. In this paper, we show that the 3-block ADMM still globally converges with any penalty parameter γ > 0 if the third function f3 in the objective is smooth and strongly convex, and its condition number is in [1, 1.0798), besides some other mild conditions. This requirement covers an important class of problems to be called regularized least squares decomposition (RLSD) in this paper.	algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;condition number;convex optimization;entity–relationship model;least squares;local convergence;mathematical optimization	Tianyi Lin;Necdet Serhat Aybat;Shuzhong Zhang	2018	J.

First, it is shown that the arithmetic mean of a RK method and its adjoint counterpart is symmetric. Second, the symplectic adjoint method is introduced and a simple way to construct symplectic PRK methods via the symplectic adjointmethod is provided. Some relevant properties of the adjointmethod and the symplectic adjoint method are discussed. Third, a class of symplectic PRKmethods are proposed based on Radau IA, Radau IIA and their adjoint methods. The structure of the PRK methods is similar to that of Lobatto IIIA–IIIB pairs and is of block forms. Finally, some examples of symplectic partitioned Runge–Kutta methods are presented. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

223fae5107e10bc35c8e5b23d627a85e7be93931	cmos low power cell library for digital design		Historically, VLSI designers have focused on increasing the speed and reducing the area of digital systems. However, the evolution of portable systems and advanced Deep Sub-Micron fabrication technologies have brought power dissipation as another critical design factor. Low power design reduces cooling cost and increases reliability especially for high density systems. Moreover, it reduces the weight and size of portable devices. The power dissipation in CMOS circuits consists of static and dynamic components. Since dynamic power is proportional to V 2 dd and static power is proportional to Vdd, lowering the supply voltage and device dimensions, the transistor threshold voltage also has to be scaled down to achieve the required performance. In case of static power, the power is consumed during the steady state condition i.e when there are no input/output transitions. Static power has two sources: DC power and Leakage power. Consecutively to facilitate voltage scaling without disturbing the performance, threshold voltage has to be minimized. Furthermore it leads to better noise margins and helps to avoid the hot carrier effects in short channel devices. In this paper we have been proposed the new CMOS library for the complex digital design using scaling the supply voltage and device dimensions and also suggest the methods to control the leakage current to obtain the minimum power dissipation at optimum value of supply voltage and transistor threshold. In this paper CMOS Cell library has been implemented using TSMC (0.18um) and TSMC (90nm) technology using HEP2 tool of IC designing from Mentor Graphics for various analysis and simulations.	cmos;cpu power dissipation;computer cooling;computer performance;digital electronics;dynamic voltage scaling;graphics;hot-carrier injection;image scaling;input/output;logic synthesis;mobile device;noise margin;simulation;spectral leakage;steady state;transistor;very-large-scale integration	Kanika Kaur;Arti Noor	2013	CoRR		embedded system;power module;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;switched-mode power supply	Arch	18.720138437526643	59.53201552326758	1746

The fluid is viscous and the flow is slow, steady and incompressible. The solution has been obtained in terms of velocity field while the pressure terms are eliminated using the penalty function approach. The degree of the finite element approximation can be increased as much as one needs with this higher order shape function formulation. The method is tested in a lid-driven square cavity and it is found that there is a relationship between the viscosity and penalty parameter. From one solution one can obtain all the other solutions only by arranging one of the parameters since the product of these parameters has been shown that is a fixed constant. Selected graphs of the velocity field are given showing these behaviors.	finite element method;navier–stokes equations	R.

Due to the excessive channel delay spread in CDD, traditional in-band pilot assisted channel estimation with limited frequency resolution fails to track the considerable variation in the frequency domain. Alternatively, increasing pilot overhead will degrade the system throughput significantly. In this paper, we propose to use superimposed pilots to estimate highly frequency selective channels in CDD-OFDM systems. Compared to in-band pilot based channel estimation, the proposed scheme with pilot symbols superimposed over each subcarrier has full frequency resolution, hence it is more robust to severe frequency selectivity from the excessively long CDD channel. Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to estimate the channel iteratively based on superimposed pilots and tentative soft decisions. At the end of each iteration, to exploit the inherent channel sparsity and refine the estimate, channel taps are sorted and selected according to power. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is promising in time varying fading channels without an increase in pilot overhead.	cdd;channel state information;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency divider;iteration;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;overhead (computing);selectivity (electronic);simulation;sparse matrix;subcarrier;throughput	Weikun Hou;Xianbin Wang	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962561	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;expectation–maximization algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;frequency domain;fading	Mobile	48.44439155707564	79.55708367921629	1756

We show how each of the related sub-problems can be conceptually solved in the time domain and in the information domain.

Coverage control is used to select as few active nodes as possible from all deployed sensor nodes such that sufficient coverage of the monitored area can be guaranteed, while reducing the energy consumption of each individual sensor node to prolong the network lifetime. This paper presents a distributed and localized technique called the layered diffusion based coverage control (LDCC). The LDCC protocol does not require information on the node location coordinates when selecting active nodes. Instead, it exploits the hop count information, which is easily obtained in a WSN, to select active sensor nodes. Furthermore, the LDCC protocol is very simple and does not require any sophisticated computation such as distance or covered area computation. Our simulation results show that the LDCC protocol achieves high coverage ratio while incurring very low message overhead compared with other existing protocols.	computation;overhead (computing);sensor node;simulation	Bang Wang;Cheng Fu;Hock-Beng Lim	2007	32nd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN 2007)	10.1016/j.comnet.2008.12.013	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-0.17670248276470563	75.51541854142866	1773

Although multipath propagation offers diversity and benefits in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions, simultaneous multipath and mobility results in a doubly-selective fading channel. In practice, this means that the channel parameters vary significantly in both time and frequency within the bandwidth and typical packet durations used in 802.11p/WAVE standards for short-range vehicular communications. This paper presents the results of extensive field trial campaigns conducted in several countries, totaling over 1100 km. These field trials are scenario based, focusing on challenging low-latency, high-reliability vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) safety applications including intersection collision warning, turn across path, emergency electronic brake light, do not pass warning, and precrash sensing. Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) applications are also considered. The field trials compared the performance of off-the-shelf WiFi-based radio equipment with a more advanced 802.11p compliant radio employing more sophisticated channel estimation and tracking. Field trial results demonstrate significantly improved performance using the advanced radio, translating into greatly increased driver warning times and stopping distances. In fact the results show that off-the-shelf WiFi equipment fails to provide sufficient stopping distance to avert accidents in some cases. During the field trials, channel sounding data were also captured. Analysis of these channel measurements reveals the critical importance of accurate channel estimation, tracking the channel in both time and frequency within each packet. Delay spread and Doppler spread statistics computed from the channel measurements validate previously reported results in the literature. The results in this paper, however, provide the first instance of channel measurements performed simultaneously to application performance evaluation. The objective is to firmly establish the link between radio channel characteristics and the performance of critical V2V safety applications.	automatic sounding;channel state information;doppler effect;line-of-sight (missile);multipath propagation;network packet;performance evaluation;software propagation;vehicle-to-vehicle	Paul D.

Sensors collect data from the environment and instead of directly sending them to the mobile sinks (henceforth simply “sinks”), they route data to a number of selected nodes (we call them relay or stashing nodes) in the network. These stashing nodes lie on the trajectories of the sinks, and relay the received data directly to the sinks on behalf of the sensors. Assuming a set of p different applications being executed on each sensor node, we consider the following problem: Given a set of p trajectories T1, T2, …, TP corresponding to p sinks, where sink Ti is dedicated to collect i-th application data, node u selects at least k stashing nodes from Ti such that it can forward at least k copies of its i-application data to them. The goal of u is to minimize the total routing cost to send all its p application data to the corresponding stashing nodes of p trajectories. We use the expected number of transmissions on a link as the routing cost of the link and the routing cost for a path is the sum of all the link costs of that path. We wish to minimize the sum of the total routing costs of all the nodes. We call this the Minimum Cost Stashing problem and formulate this as a primal-dual problem. We present a 1/2(2f −k + 1)-approximation algorithm using the primal-dual method for approximation algorithms, where f is the maximum size of a trajectory.	approximation algorithm;download;duality (optimization);order of approximation;relay;robustness (computer science);routing;sensor node	Salimur Choudhury;Kamrul Islam;Selim G.

At each time slot, each station estimates the probability that n stations are ready to transmit a packet for each n, using Bayes’ rule and the observed history of collisions, successful transmissions, and holes (empty slots). A station transmits a packet in a probabilistic manner based on these estimates. Tbis strategy is called Bayesian broadcast. An elegant and very practical strategy-pseudo-Bayesian broadcast-is then derived by approximating the probability estimates with a Poisson distribution with mean Y and further simplifying. Each station keeps a copy of V, transmits a packet with probability 1 / Y, and then updates Y in two steps:. l For collisions, increment v by (e 2)-l = 1.39221 *.* . For successes and holes, decrement Y by 1. l Set Y to max (V + x, l), where x is an estimate of the arrival rate A of new packets into the system.

That test scheme gives us the intermediate frequency of VCO as well as the maximum and the minimum frequency.

Simulations show that the signal-to-noise ratio gain of using this new metric, compared to ignoring the uncertainty of the channel estimate, may be as large as 1 dB at a bit error probability of 10/sup -3/. This gain is obtained without any complexity increase.		Pål K. Frenger	2000	IEEE Trans.

073aa79ecc1508852900211bf7fdd119364798ec	radar networks performance analysis and topology optimization		The ultimate goal of any sensing system is to build situation awareness. Existing solutions for a single radar node that have to assure extended areas of coverage with high resolution measurements (in range, cross-range, and Doppler) are physically cumbersome (large antenna size) and typically require large operational resources (high transmit power, wide bandwidth and long integration time). Combining data from multiple spatially separated nodes located at several locations offers a possibility to use radars with low-cost omnidirectional antennas to cover wide areas and overcome operational limitations such as sector blockage due to landscape or high-rise buildings. Thus, performance of the complete system becomes dependent not only on the parameters of a single radar node, but on the number of nodes and their location (system topology) as well. A proper selection of both node-related (transmit power, operational frequency and bandwidth, integration time, etc.) and system-related (node location, node cooperation) resources is an important design task, which forms the major focus of this thesis. The first part of this dissertation is dedicated to the development of the radar network performance assessment tool,while the second part provides the framework for radar network topology optimization. The potential accuracy of the target parameters estimation has been used for radar network performance assessment. The developed tool incorporates parameters of a single radar node as well as system parameters (positions of the nodes and their cooperation), evaluated using Cramer-Rao lower bound. Using the tools developed, performance of different types of radar networks have been studied and compared in this thesis. For the radar network topology optimization several convex and greedy algorithms have been used, making the optimization approach versatile. Validation and performance comparison of the optimization algorithms have been performed in this thesis. The results obtained in this research can be used to evaluate the potential performance of radar networks for different applications and provide a solution to key problems of their topology design.	mathematical optimization;profiling (computer programming);topology optimization	Inna M.

Very often, many applications in science and engineering are reducible to this type of graph. Hence, a simplified form of a complete graph contributes in providing the solutions to these problems. In this paper, we present a technique for transforming a complete graph into a single-row routing problem. Single-row routing is a classical technique in the VLSI design that is known to be NP-complete. We solved this problem earlier using a method called ESSR, and, the same technique is applied to the present work to transform a complete graph into its single-row routing representation. A parallel computing model is proposed which contributes in making the problem modular and scalable. We also discuss the application of this work on the channel assignment problem in the wireless cellular telephone networks.	algorithm;assignment problem;connectivity (graph theory);mobile phone;np-completeness;parallel computing;routing;scalability;simulated annealing;very-large-scale integration	Shaharuddin Salleh;Stephan Olariu;Bahrom Sanugi;Mohd Ismail Abd Aziz	2005	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-005-0184-4	lattice graph;graph power;routing;factor-critical graph;parallel computing;graph bandwidth;simulated annealing;telephone network;null graph;telecommunications;computer science;clique-width;connectivity;theoretical computer science;simplex graph;wireless network;forbidden graph characterization;circuit design;voltage graph;distributed computing;parallel algorithm;assignment problem;graph;very-large-scale integration;complete graph;complement graph;algorithm;strength of a graph;computer network	EDA	1.402336940631296	69.43909444792226	1793

Under standard assumptions, we establish that the existence of the central path is equivalent to the nonemptiness and boundedness of the optimal set. Other equivalent conditions are given, such as the existence of a strictly dual feasible point or the existence of a single central point. The monotonie behavior of the logarithmic barrier and the objective function along the trajectory is also discussed. Finally, the existence and optimality of cluster points are established.	computer cluster;loss function;nonlinear system;optimization problem;petri net;semidefinite programming	L.

It considers the major issues facing the design community and possible ways forward to improve productivity and quality. Design challenges today As we have entered the 90s we see evidence of significant technology shifts that will continue to offer design challenges throughout the 90s. These include ASIC technology as complexity increases, testability becomes an issue. Physical technology as the introduction of new packaging such as MCMS leads to further increases in density of designs. System technology whereby use of complex ASICS and new packaging techniques combine with a rise in clock speeds. This leads to engineering design and physical layout becoming inextricably linked. Design challenges tomorrow The key emerging challenges ase those of Productivity and Quality. In order to remain competitive, getting high performance products to market earlier, and at the right qurdity becomes the key differentiator. To meet these challenges we believe that changes in design methodologies and organizations will be needed, as well as the EDA tools used. During the 80’s, point tool solutions were used successfully by different disciplines. These have started to come together and we see that systems design, ASIC design and PCB layout will become fully interdependent by the mid 90’s. Meeting the challenges We believe that the challenges can be met by using a ‘Right-First-Time’ Integrated System Designl approach, coupled with the necessary organizational changes to form multi-discipline teams, The Integrated System needs to include the following elemen& Top Down System Design, probably using VHDL and utilizing ASICS. Analysis artd Tolerancing capability including Logic and Timing (including Worst Case), Signal Integrity Analysis, (e.g. post-layout effects regarding crosstalk, transmission line effects, etc.) and Thermal Analysis. Rules Driven Design for Manufacture these are to consider, as part of the design process, the requirements to manufacture to high quality levels. The EDA tools will produce ‘correct by construction’ designs, driven by the constraints specified. Framework the framework used must offer the capability to integrate all of the tools required. For maximum productivity there should be real time communications between the major tools. This allows the engineer to quickly access the particular views of a particular design area that he is considering, across the full toolset. The framework should also allow for design data management to be considered. Tools are needed to manage such areas as the ever increasing number of libraries, and capabilities to link to customer specific tools are necessary. Organization considerations As the toolsets become more interdependent this reflects the design process changes that are happening. Multi-discipline teams are required to ensure that all areas design, layout, manufacturing have their requirements input at the design stage of the process to ensure optimum quality andtime to market. 0-8186-2780-8/’92$3.0001992 IEEE 599 This is achieved by a ‘Right-First-Time’ approach removing the need for time consuming re-work due to mis-communication between current disciplines. The process can no longer be viewed as primarily ‘engineering’ or ‘layout’. A multi-discipline view must be considered to input the ‘rules’ that define quality. Quality considerations The objective is to produce ‘Quality’ products. Thus ‘Quality’ has to be designed in. The EDA tools must reflect a design methodology that enables capture of quality goals as design rules. Rules-driven EDA tools then store and communicate those design decisions from/to various disciplines whilst ensuring that the design is ‘right-by-construction’.	application-specific integrated circuit;crosstalk;design for manufacturability;differentiator;display resolution;electronic design automation;engineering design process;ibm 2780/3780;integrated circuit layout;interdependence;library (computing);pcb;requirement;signal integrity;systems design;transmission line;vhdl;while	Roy Davies	1992			process design;embedded system;packaging and labeling;productivity;design methods;electronic design automation;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;application-specific integrated circuit;structured systems analysis and design method;manufacturing engineering;computer engineering;systems design	EDA	9.770994487536946	54.71510485739177	1804

The proposed extension allows differential weighting of conflicts between pairs of commercials. We formulate the problem as a capacitated generalization of the max k-cut problem in which the vertices of a graph correspond to commercial insertions and the edge weights to the conflicts between pairs of insertions. The objective is to partition the vertices into k capacitated sets so as to maximize the sum of conflict weights across partitions. We note that the problem is NP-Hard. We extend a localsearch procedure due to Bollapragada and Garbiras (2004) to allow for the differential weighting of edge weights. We show that for problems with equal insertion lengths and break durations, the worst-case bound on the performance of the proposed algorithm increases with the number of program breaks and the number of insertions per break, and that it is independent of the number of conflicts between pairs of insertions. Simulation results suggest that the algorithm performs well even if the problem size is small.	aggregate data;algorithm;analysis of algorithms;best, worst and average case;book;graph theory;heuristic;maximum cut;minimum k-cut;np-hardness;paging;scheduling (computing);simulation;television;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Daya Ram Gaur;Ramesh Krishnamurti;Rajeev Kohli	2009	Operations Research	10.1287/opre.1080.0635	partition;insertion;mathematical optimization;media;computer science;artificial intelligence;local search;operations management;heuristics;conflict resolution;np-hard;mathematics;television;scheduling;algorithm	DB	18.58241369274754	12.03619524585384	1812

Hierarchical interconnection networks provide high performance at low cost by exploring the locality that exists in the communication patterns of massively parallel computers. A hierarchical torus network (HTN) is a 2D-torus network of multiple basic modules, in which the basic modules are 3D-torus networks that are hierarchically interconnected for higher level networks. The static network performance of the HTN has already been studied and has been shown to be good. Dynamic communication performance has been evaluated under uniform traffic patterns but not under a nonuniform traffic, such as matrix transpose traffic patterns. In this paper, we present a deadlock-free routing algorithm for the HTN using 3 virtual channels and evaluate the network's dynamic communication performance under matrix transpose traffic, using the proposed routing algorithm. We evaluate the dynamic communication performance of HTN, H3D-mesh, TESH, and mesh networks by computer simulation. We find that the dynamic communication performance of HTN is better than that of the H3D-mesh, TESH, and mesh networks.	algorithm;computer simulation;deadlock;experiment;hierarchical task network;interconnection;locality of reference;maximum throughput scheduling;mesh networking;network performance;parallel computing;routing;the matrix;virtual channel	M.

This new type of power supply is inductorless and, consequently, suitable for hybridization and even monolithic integration. The new design is also based on distinguishing characteristics of pocket digital computer systems, in which a switched-capacitor converter can work well, since minimal regulation is required. The new device may enable the pocket computer system to be powered by only one battery, resulting in a simple topology. Two switched-capacitor converters, +12 V/-12 V, +5 V and +5 V/+12 V, -12 V, are shown, respectively, as an example for demonstrating the basic principle and its performance. PSPICE simulation and laboratory models show good results for this new type of power supply.	pocket computer;power supply	Jian Liu;Zhiming Chen;Zhong Du	1998	IEEE Trans.

This paper deals with a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based measurement technique, which can be easily employed to accurately determine the harmonic components of a distorted signal, i.e., voltage or current. The proposed method is based on a modulated sliding DFT algorithm, which is unconditionally stable and does not accumulate errors due to finite precision representation, and a variable sampling period technique (VSPT) to achieve a frequency adaptive mechanism. It is worth noting that the VSPT changes the sampling period for a variable grid frequency condition, leading to a constant sampling frequency under steady-state conditions. The proposed method provides: 1) high degree of accuracy; 2) structural/performance robustness; and 3) frequency adaptability. Given the modular nature of the method, it is implemented on a field programmable gate array. Simulations and experimental tests are shown to verify the performance of the proposed method.	algorithm;complex system;computer simulation;damping factor;discrete fourier transform;electric power quality;field-programmable gate array;modulation;requirement;robustness (computer science);sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;spectral leakage;steady state	Carlos M.

A """"proof"""" of L )W is written in a way that requires service to be in order of arrival, even though restriction can be avoided with a little explanation. The explanation of PASTA is serviceable. Chapter Three is devoted to birth-anddeath queues. A nice feature of the presentation is that the conservation of flow principle (called the rate-equality principle here) is given at the start of the chapter. It is used to get the familiar balance equations for the M/M/1 queue, Ap, + #p, Ap,_ zPn+ a more refined application would produce the rate-up equals rate-down equations, Ap, #p+, which are easier to work with. Waiting times, output processes, and busy period analysis are given for the usual models. Significant attention is paid to transient analysis, and the waiting time distribution for the finite-source FIFO model is derived. There are 22 exercises that explore variations of the basic models. The next chapter covers Markovian models that are not birth-and-death processes. This includes the method of stages for queues with Erlang arrivals or services and some bulk queues. The latter is treated extensively, and is a distinguishing feature of this book. Chapter Five is about networks of queues. Open and dosed Jackson networks are described, and a proof of Jackson’s theorem is given. The interpretation of this theorem is not stated carefully enough: """"It is implied that the states n of individual nodes i, (i 1, 2,... ,k) in steady state are independent random variables."""" BCMP networks are defined, and the product form result is stated but not proven. The sixth chapter covers the embedded Markov chain models, M/G/I, GI/M/1, GI/M/c, and the insensitivity property of the M/G/c/c model. The penultimate chapter covers the G/G/1 models. This includes the LindIcy equations, Marshall’s characterization of the moments of the waiting time in terms of moments of the idle times, and some bounds. The final chapter contains Kingman’s heavy traffic approximation for the waiting time in the GI/G/1 queue, diffusion approximations for several non-Markovian queues, queueing systems with vacations, and design and control models. In summary, this is a good book for learning about the important formulas in queueing theory. The presentation is clean and basically correct. The exercises contain some interesting results, and the references are extensive."""	approximation;embedded system;erlang (programming language);fifo (computing and electronics);jackson;jorge stolfi;markov chain;queue (abstract data type);queueing theory;steady state;transient state	John F.

Mesh nodes can be equipped with multiradios to improve the overall capacity of the WMNs. Nodes avoid interference with each other by tuning to different channels of the spectrum space. The key problem is how to allocate the channels to these multi-radio nodes, especially when they are heterogeneous with diverse transmission types and bandwidths. Most of current work has been based on the conflict-graph model and given solutions that focused on either increasing bandwidth utilization or minimizing starvation. In this paper, we propose a new bipartite-graph based model and design a channel allocation algorithm that considers both bandwidth utilization and starvation problem. Our solution is based on using augmenting path to find a matching in the bipartite-graph and can minimize starvation and then maximize the bandwidth utilization. The simulations demonstrate that our algorithm can reduce the starvation ratio and improve the bandwidth utilization, compared with previous conflict-graph based algorithms.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);flow network;heterogeneous computing;interference (communication);mesh networking;self-organization;serializability;simulation;starvation (computer science);wireless mesh network	Jianjun Yang;Zongming Fei	2009	Int.

We have designed a dual polarized circular patch antenna which has two orthogonal polarization ports such as vertical polarization (V) and horizontal polarization (H) on its metal surface. This design makes it works as two independent antennas in multipath environments. By using two dual polarized antennas at both the transmitter and receiver, we designed a dual-polarization 4 × 4 MIMO experiment system. This system can be used to investigate the performance of various MIMO transmission methods as well as the performance of adaptive algorithms in indoor multipath environments. To investigate the performance of our experiment system, we carried out a number of MIMO transmission experiments such as space-time-coded transmission having two parallel streams and MIMO eigenmode transmission. We will show the results of those experiments and discuss the advantages of using polarization diversity in MIMO communication system for next generation broadband wireless communication. key words: MIMO, polarization diversity, space-time coading, MIMO eigenmode transmission, singular value decomposition (SVD)	algorithm;experiment;mimo;multipath propagation;next-generation network;normal mode;polarization (waves);singular value decomposition;transmitter	Nirmal Kumar Das;Masahiro Shinozawa;Norihisa Miyadai;Tetsuki Taniguchi;Yoshio Karasawa	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e89-b.9.2522	3g mimo;multi-user mimo;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;polarization;spatial multiplexing;mimo	Networks	44.96314772862626	83.54051187377915	1878

The main idea is that secondary users (SUs) transmit data opportunistically by utilizing idle licensed frequency bands. The transmission of a SU may get interrupted several times due to the ar- rival of primary (licensed) users; the SU then needs to sense the spectrum to determine another available channel for retransmission. In this paper, we investigate the performance of SUs in a cognitive radio network. To this end, we develop a three-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model of the system. We present an efficient method to compute steady-state probabilities by exploiting the specific Quasi-Birth-Death structure of the CTMC. Based on this, several SU performance mea- sures are evaluated such as the mean delay of a SU, the SU interruption probability, the probability of a SU getting discarded from the system after an interruption and the SU blocking probability upon arrival. Nu- merical examples illustrate the influence of system parameters such as the sensing rate on the SU performance.	cognitive radio	Osama I.

A realistic model for this problem is given by the vertex-disjoint packing of two Steiner trees (2VPST), which is known to be NP-complete. This work presents an investigation on the 2VPST polyhedra. The main idea is to depart from facet-defining inequalities for a vertex-weighted Steiner tree polyhedra. Some of these inequalities are proven to also define facets for the packing polyhedra, while others are lifted to derive new important families of inequalities, including proven facets. Separation algorithms are also presented. The resulting branch-and-cut code has an excellent performance and is capable of solving problems on grid graphs with up to 10000 vertices and 5000 terminals in a few minutes.	branch and cut;polyhedron;set packing;steiner tree problem	Eduardo Uchoa;Marcus Poggi de Aragão	1999		10.1007/3-540-48777-8_33	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;steiner tree problem;mathematics;geometry;algorithm	Theory	22.661243476633203	29.573655180964586	1889
e074916d7fd7346aabfe8fb6f7c7b8c4b91f130a	going beyond primal treewidth for (m)ilp		Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and its mixed variant (MILP) are archetypical examples of NP-complete optimization problems which have a wide range of applications in various areas of artificial intelligence. However, we still lack a thorough understanding of which structural restrictions make these problems tractable. Here we focus on structure captured via so-called decompositional parameters, which have been highly successful in fields such as boolean satisfiability and constraint satisfaction but have not yet reached their full potential in the ILP setting. In particular, primal treewidth (an established decompositional parameter) can only be algorithmically exploited to solve ILP under restricted circumstances. Our main contribution is the introduction and algorithmic exploitation of two new decompositional parameters for ILP and MILP. The first, torso-width, is specifically tailored to the linear programming setting and is the first decompositional parameter which can also be used for MILP. The latter, incidence treewidth, is a concept which originates from boolean satisfiability but has not yet been used in the ILP setting; here we obtain a full complexity landscape mapping the precise conditions under which incidence treewidth can be used to obtain efficient algorithms. Both of these parameters overcome previous shortcomings of primal treewidth for ILP in unique ways, and consequently push the frontiers of tractability for these important problems.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;boolean satisfiability problem;cobham's thesis;constraint satisfaction;incidence matrix;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;np-completeness;treewidth	Robert Ganian;Sebastian Ordyniak;M.

The precoding problem is a joint optimization of analog and digital precoders, and we treat it as a matrix factorization problem with power and constant modulus constraints. This paper presents three main contributions. First, we present a sufficient condition and a necessary condition for hybrid precoding schemes to realize unconstrained optimal precoders exactly when the number of data streams <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$N_{\mathrm {s}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> satisfies <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$N_{\mathrm {s}}=\min \{\mathrm {rank}({\mathbf{H}}),N_{\mathrm {rf}}\}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\mathbf{H}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> represents the channel matrix and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$N_{\mathrm {rf}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is the number of radio frequency chains. Second, we show that the coupled power constraint in our matrix factorization problem can be removed without loss of optimality. Third, we propose a Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno-based algorithm to solve our matrix factorization problem using gradient and Hessian information.

Mallows' theory of non-linear smoothers [1] has proven to be of great theoretical significance providing simple design guidelines for non-linear smoothers. It allows us to find a set of positive weights for a WM filter whose sample selection probabilities (SSP's) are as close as possible to a SSP set predetermined by Mallow's. Sample selection probabilities have been used as a basis for designing stack smoothers as they give a measure of the filter's detail preserving ability and give non-negative filter weights. We will extend this idea to design weighted median filters admitting negative weights. The new method first finds the linear FIR filter coefficients adaptively, which are then used to determine the weights of the median filter. WM filters can be designed to have band-pass, high-pass as well as low-pass frequency characteristics. Unlike the linear filters, however, the weighted median filters are robust in the presence of impulsive noise, as shown by the simulation results.© (2002) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Heavy intermittent charging load of EVs will create bottlenecks in supplying capacity and expose power system to severe security risks. In this paper, we propose an intelligent method to control EV charging loads in response to time-of-use (TOU) price in a regulated market. First, an optimized charging model is formulated to minimize the charging cost. Then, a heuristic method is implemented to minimize the charging cost considering the relation between the acceptable charging power of EV battery and the state of charge (SOC). Finally, the charging cost and energy demand in different time intervals are compared for both typical charging pattern and optimized charging pattern. Results show that the optimized charging pattern has great benefit in reducing cost and flatting the load curve if the peak and valley time periods are partitioned appropriately.	extended validation certificate;heuristic;load profile;norm (social);qualitative comparative analysis;requirement;simulation;software deployment;state of charge;terms of service	Yijia Cao;Shengwei Tang;Canbing Li;Peng Zhang;Yi Tan;Zhikun Zhang;Junxiong Li	2012	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2011.2159630	pricing;system on a chip;simulation;engineering;electrical engineering;operations management;electricity;energy management	EDA	3.5395128978778923	5.890444510631234	1926
2c37f71a01bbb76dd7e4f4db5cb004adab704989	interference alignment in distributed antenna systems		Interference alignment (IA) is a cooperative transmission strategy that improves spectral efficiency in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, yet performs poorly in low-SNR scenarios. This limits IA’s utility in cellular systems as it is ineffective in improving cell-edge data rates. Modern cellular architectures such as distributed antenna systems (DAS), however, promise to boost cell-edge SNR, creating the environment needed to realize practical IA gains. Existing IA solutions cannot be applied to DAS as they neglect the per-remote-radio power constraints imposed on distributed precoders. This paper considers two types of distributed antenna IA systems: ones with a limit on maximum per-radio power, and ones with a strict equality constraint on per-radio power. The rate-loss incurred by a simple power back-off strategy, used in systems with maximum power constraints, is characterized analytically. It is also shown that enforcing strict power constraints avoids such a rate-loss but negatively affects IA feasibility. For such systems, an IA algorithm is proposed and feasibility conditions are derived based on the concept of system properness. Finally, numerical results validate the analysis and demonstrate that IA and DAS can be successfully combined to mitigate inter-cell interference and improve performance for most mobile users, especially those at the cell-edge.	algorithm;interference (communication);maximum power transfer theorem;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency	Jonathan Starr;Omar El Ayach;Robert W.

df4de903bb8d745450116db1f2135616dd5daf6e	ranking with fairness constraints		Ranking algorithms are deployed widely to order a set of items in applications such as search engines, news feeds, and recommendation systems. Recent studies, however, have shown that, left unchecked, the output of ranking algorithms can result in decreased diversity in the type of content presented, promote stereotypes, and polarize opinions. In order to address such issues, we study the following variant of the traditional ranking problem when, in addition, there are fairness or diversity constraints. Given a collection of items along with 1) the value of placing an item in a particular position in the ranking, 2) the collection of sensitive attributes (such as gender, race, political opinion) of each item and 3) a collection of fairness constraints that, for each k, bound the number of items with each attribute that are allowed to appear in the top k positions of the ranking, the goal is to output a ranking that maximizes the value with respect to the original rank quality metric while respecting the constraints. This problem encapsulates various well-studied problems related to bipartite and hypergraph matching as special cases and turns out to be hard to approximate even with simple constraints. Our main technical contributions are fast exact and approximation algorithms along with complementary hardness results that, together, come close to settling the approximability of this constrained ranking maximization problem. Unlike prior work on the approximability of constrained matching problems, our algorithm runs in linear time, even when the number of constraints is (polynomially) large, its approximation ratio does not depend on the number of constraints, and it produces solutions with small constraint violations. Our results rely on insights about the constrained matching problem when the objective function satisfies certain properties that appear in common ranking metrics such as discounted cumulative gain (DCG), Spearman’s rho or Bradley-Terry, along with the nested structure of fairness constraints. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Information systems → Retrieval models and ranking, Theory of computation → Approximation algorithms analysis, Theory of computation → Discrete optimization	3-dimensional matching;approximation algorithm;definite clause grammar;discrete optimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;fairness measure;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;recommender system;theory of computation;time complexity;web search engine	L.

42a6972dec99790bf628ac286a1c7360b6091892	adaptive handover decision algorithm based on multi-influence factors through carrier aggregation implementation in lte-advanced system		Although Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-Advanced) system has benefited from Carrier Aggregation (CA) technology, the advent of CA technology has increased handover scenario probability through user mobility. That leads to a user’s throughput degradation and its outage probability. Therefore, a handover decision algorithm must be designed properly in order to contribute effectively for reducing this phenomenon. In this paper, Multi-Influence Factors for Adaptive Handover Decision Algorithm (MIFAHODA) have been proposed through CA implementation in LTE-Advanced system. MIF-AHODA adaptively makes handover decisions based on different decision algorithms, which are selected based on the handover scenario type and resource availability. Simulation results show that MIF-AHODA enhances system performance better than the other considered algorithms from the literature by 8.3 dB, 46%, and 51% as average gains over all the considered algorithms in terms of SINR, cell-edge spectral efficiency, and outage probability reduction, respectively.

Most previous algorithms use greedy approach as a subcarrier allocation scheme until a conflict occurs or as an initial first round allocation with improvement steps carried out in next rounds. Our algorithm uses information obtained by the forced costs of a system that incur by a current allocation to make assignment decisions. This algorithm does not rely on greedy approach and therefore can also be considered as a substitute for first layer Greedy algorithms. Simulation results show that for two user case this algorithm gives better or equal allocation 80-90 percent of the time when compared with the greedy allocation.	allocative efficiency;greedy algorithm;multi-user;multiuser dos;simulation;subcarrier	Gayan Munasinghe;Dhammika Jayalath;Karla Ziri-Castro	2012	2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2012.6362554	mathematical optimization;greedy algorithm;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;theoretical computer science	Embedded	34.67689696459468	90.85345948519337	1956

The sensors are deployed around the area to sense the activities in the area or placed outside the critical facility for sensing the movements of incoming and outgoing of personnel worked in the facility. The distributed sensors are capable of sensing and linking with each other in order to communicate the gathered data via a sensor to a nearby high energy communication node (HECN). The HECN served as a transmission relay to deliver gathered data from the ground to a high-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Two scenarios are implemented by using the enhanced MOGA to achieve the sensor deployment by minimizing the number of sensors and maximizing the coverage. Simulation results will show the Pareto-optimal front, sensor deployment and communication routes between sensors and the HECN.	aerial photography;genetic algorithm;pareto efficiency;perimeter;powera;relay;sensor;simulation;software deployment;sorting;unmanned aerial vehicle	Jenn-Long Liu;Jiann-Horng Lin	2010	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	10.1109/CEC.2010.5586416	embedded system;simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	11.519715069524942	77.75211022101726	1960

We give a nonclairvoyant algorithm LAPS, and show that for every power function of the form P(s)=s α , LAPS is O(1)-competitive; more precisely, the competitive ratio is 8 for α=2, 13 for α=3, and $\frac{2\alpha^{2}}{\ln\alpha}$ for α>3. We then show that there is no constant c, and no deterministic nonclairvoyant algorithm A, such that A is c-competitive for every power function of the form P(s)=s α . So necessarily the achievable competitive ratio increases as the steepness of the power function increases. Finally we show that there is a fixed, very steep, power function for which no nonclairvoyant algorithm can be O(1)-competitive.	algorithm;competitive analysis (online algorithm);image scaling;job stream	Ho-Leung Chan;Jeff Edmonds;Tak Wah Lam;Lap-Kei Lee;Alberto Marchetti-Spaccamela;Kirk Pruhs	2010	Algorithmica	10.1007/s00453-010-9420-2	competitive analysis;mathematical optimization;simulation;data structure;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;programming language	Theory	15.878266622054724	12.879985210858477	1962

Determining the minimum size of C k-saturated graphs is one of the interesting problems on extremal graphs. The exact minimum sizes are known for k = 3, 4 and 5, but only general bounds are shown for k ≥ 6. This paper deals with bounds of the minimum size when k = 6. It is shown that the minimum size of a C 6-saturated graph on n vertices is no greater than ï¿¿ 3n−3 2 ï¿¿ and no less than ï¿¿ 7n 6 ï¿¿ − 2. This lower bound, which is first proposed exclusively for the C 6-saturated graphs, significantly improves the best previously known lower bound.

(1) each row and each column is Latin (i.e., every element of  X  is in precisely one cell of each row and each column) and   2.   (2) every unordered pair of elements from  X  is in at most one cell of the array.     Necessary conditions on the parameters  s  and  n  are  n  ⩽  s  ⩽ 2 n  −1. The existence question for  H (2 n , 2 n  + 2) was settled in 1977 by Schellenberg, van Rees, and Vanstone and the existence question for complementary  H (2 n , 2 n  + 2) was settled in 1985 by Lamken and Vanstone: for  n  a positive integer,  n  ⩾ 2, there exists a complementary  H (2 n , 2 n  + 2). The existence of  ∗ complementary  H (2 n , 2 n  + 2) was also established with a finite number of possible exceptions. In this paper, we prove the existence of skew  H (2 n , 2 n  + 2) s  for  n  a positive integer,  n  ⩾ 2,  n  ≠ 3 with the possible exceptions of  n  = 5 and  n  = 9. We also improve the existence result for  ∗ complementary  H (2 n , 2 n  + 2) s  to prove the existence of  ∗ complementary  H (2 n , 2 n  + 2) s  for all positive integers  n ,  n  ⩾ 2.		Esther R.

We consider both the case of easy invertible collision operators and the challenging case of Boltzmann collision operators. We give sufficient conditions in order that such methods are asymptotic preserving and asymptotically accurate. Their monotonicity properties are also studied. In the case of the Boltzmann operator the methods are based on the introduction of a penalization technique for the collision integral. This reformulation of the collision operator permits us to construct penalized IMEX schemes which work uniformly for a wide range of relaxation times avoiding the expensive implicit resolution of the collision operator. Finally, we show some numerical results which confirm the theoretical analysis.	runge–kutta methods	Giacomo Dimarco;Lorenzo Pareschi	2013	SIAM J.

While the filters used in previous spectral graph wavelet constructions are only adapted to the length of the spectrum, the filters proposed in this paper are adapted to the distribution of graph Laplacian eigenvalues, and therefore lead to atoms with better discriminatory power. Our approach is to first characterize a family of systems of uniformly translated kernels in the graph spectral domain that give rise to tight frames of atoms generated via generalized translation on the graph. We then warp the uniform translates with a function that approximates the cumulative spectral density function of the graph Laplacian eigenvalues. We use this approach to construct computationally efficient, spectrum-adapted, tight vertex-frequency and graph wavelet frames. We give numerous examples of the resulting spectrum-adapted graph filters, and also present an illustrative example of vertex-frequency analysis using the proposed construction.	addendum;algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;convolution;correctness (computer science);dictionary;dirac comb;distribution (mathematics);emoticon;frequency analysis;laplacian matrix;matrix multiplication;polynomial;sinc function;spectral density;tight binding;wavelet;weight function	David I.

The command torque is produced from the actual and command motor speeds and the exciting current is caused from the actual motor speed. The control also receives a command frequency determined by the actual motor frequency and a command slip frequency also resulting from the command torque. The control controls the firing phases of thyristors in the power supply device in response to the command current, phase and frequency. The control may generate a voltage for supplying the active current and an exciting voltage to similarly control the firing phases of the thyristors.

We intend to establish close connections between the learnability/nonlearnability of a concept class and its corresponding size in terms of effective dimension, which will allow the use of powerful dimension techniques in computational learning and viceversa, the import of learning results into complexity via dimension. Firstly, we obtain a tight result on the dimension of online mistake-bound learnable classes. Secondly, in relation with PAC learning, we show that the polynomial-space dimension of PAC learnable classes of concepts is zero. This provides a hypothesis on effective dimension that implies the inherent unpredictability of concept classes (the classes that verify this property are classes not efficiently PAC learnable using any hypothesis). Thirdly, in relation to space dimension of classes that are learnable by membership query algorithms, the main result proves that polynomial-space dimension of concept classes learnable by a membership-query algorithm is zero.	algorithm;computation;computational learning theory;concept class;effective dimension;learnability;pspace;polynomial;probably approximately correct learning	Ricard Gavaldà;María López-Valdés;Elvira Mayordomo;N.

Our hypothesis asserts the existence of a non-deterministic, double-exponential time machine that runs in time O(2 nc ) (for some c > 1) accepting Σ∗ whose accepting computations cannot be computed by bounded-error, probabilistic machines running in time O(2 β2n c ) (for some β > 0). This is the first result that separates completeness notions for NP under a worst-case hardness hypothesis.	best, worst and average case;complete (complexity);computation;exptime;exponential time hypothesis;many-one reduction;nondeterministic algorithm;probabilistic turing machine;time complexity;turing completeness	Debasis Mandal;Aduri Pavan;Rajeswari Venugopalan	2014		10.4230/LIPIcs.FSTTCS.2014.445	discrete mathematics;computer science;cook–levin theorem;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	8.440478652130654	21.071850422289792	2055

We examine the presence of defective sensors by employing tests over locally gathered sensor measurements. Tests are represented with binary messages that sensors exchange over dissemination rounds using a gossip algorithm. We propose a novel probabilistic message design that allows the use of a low complexity decoder. Assuming that the maximum number of defective sensors is much smaller than the total number of sensors, we provide a bound on the number of linearly independent messages required for a successful detection of single or multiple defective sensors. Finally, simulations confirm that the proposed method outperforms algorithms based on random walk message gathering in terms of detection accuracy.	anomaly detection;distributed algorithm;experiment;sensor;simulation;sparse language;sparse matrix;with high probability	Tamara Tosic;Pascal Frossard	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288570	distributed algorithm;failure analysis;real-time computing;group testing;wireless sensor network;computer science;theoretical computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;probability;mathematics;distributed computing;statistics	Robotics	15.412875604706555	78.08268569168338	2057

The proposed in-pixel A/D converter based on integrate-and-fire modulation achieves good linearity even at 20 Meps thanks to its soft-reset mechanism. Class-AB CMOS circuits are proposed to keep static power consumption below 10 μW/pix. Each DPS cell also includes its own analog reference and bias generator. The resulting pixel digital-only I/O interface ensures low crosstalk at the FPA level. From post-layout simulation results, the imager is capable of delivering 14 bit up to 1 kfps or alternatively 4 kfps up to 10 bit. The presented MWIR imager is currently being integrated in the 0.18-μm 1P6M CMOS technology from X-FAB.	amplifier;biological neuron model;booting;cmos;cisco pix;crosstalk;image sensor;modulation;pictbridge;pixel;reboot (computing);simulation	Roger Figueras;Josep Maria Margarit;German Vergara;Victor Villamayor;Elaine Brown;Nishika Yadav;Lluís Terés;Francisco Serra-Graells	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351264	pixel;electronic engineering;electronic circuit;modulation;computer science;crosstalk;detector;cmos	Arch	59.98986618778223	51.54202120810084	2059

Our method describes GF arithmetic circuits in a hierarchical manner with high-level directed graphs associated with specific GFs and arithmetic functions. The proposed circuit description can be effectively verified by symbolic computations based on polynomial reduction using Grobner bases. The verified description is then translated into the equivalent hardware description language (HDL) codes, which are available for the conventional design flow. We first describe the proposed graph representation and present an example of the description and verification. The significant advantage of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experimental designs of parallel multipliers over GF(2m) for different word lengths and irreducible polynomials. The result shows that the proposed approach has a definite capability of formally verifying practical GF arithmetic circuits for which the conventional techniques fail. We also propose an application of this approach to cryptographic processor design. The target considered here is a 128-bit advanced encryption standard (AES) data path with a loop architecture. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first verification of this type of practical AES data path. We present a detailed description of the AES data path and its verification. The proposed approach successfully verifies the AES data path description within 800 s.	128-bit;arithmetic circuit complexity;central processing unit;code;cryptographic accelerator;cryptography;design of experiments;directed graph;encryption;grammatical framework;graph (abstract data type);gröbner basis;hardware description language;high- and low-level;irreducibility;irreducible polynomial;processor design;symbolic computation;verification and validation	Naofumi Homma;Kazuya Saito;Takafumi Aoki	2012	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2011.2157687	discrete mathematics;symbolic computation;directed graph;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;hardware description language;algorithm	EDA	10.240032397584656	45.74413551244603	2067

In practice, time sharing methods such as Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) are often exploited to create orthogonal connections. TDMA schemes however are inflexible and not suitable for decentralized implementation. In this context, approaches based on concurrent transmissions in the same frequency spectrum admitting the interference offer a promising and attractive alternative. Yet their performances deteriorate dramatically if the underlying interference coefficients are relatively large. Assuming a Gaussian Interference Channel (GIC), this paper characterizes the so-called TDMA region which is defined as a set of all interference coefficient matrices for which TDMA outperforms concurrent transmissions. We use the dimensional lifting method to prove the convexity and monotonicity of the TDMA region, which provides some insights into the scheduling design under uncertainty with respect to the interference coefficients. Finally, the analysis is used to develop strategies for resource allocation in STDMA-based wireless networks.	access control;coefficient;interference (communication);lifting scheme;performance;scheduling (computing);spectral density;telecommunications network;time-sharing	Meng Zheng;Jafar Mohammadi;Slawomir Stanczak;Haibin Yu	2012	2012 IEEE 13th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2012.6292918	channel allocation schemes;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	34.69178776393736	86.54032439184061	2075

We carry out the study of codimensiontwo local bifurcations of equilibria (Takens–Bogdanov and Hopf-zero) and show that they are nondegenerate. This allows to put in evidence the presence of several kinds of bifurcations of periodic orbits (secondary Hopf, . . .) and of global phenomena (homoclinic, heteroclinic). The results obtained are applied in the study of the Rössler equation.	bifurcation theory;degeneracy (graph theory);dynamical system;net (polyhedron);rössler attractor;unfolding (dsp implementation)	Emilio Freire;Estanislao Gamero;Alejandro J.

The interval containment digraphs are the digraphs of Ferrers dimension 2, and the circular-arc containment digraphs are the complements of circular-arc intersection digraphs. A poset is an interval containment poset if and only if its comparability digraph is an interval containment digraph, and a graph is an interval graph if and only if the corresponding symmetric digraph with loops is an interval digraph. In an appropriate model of overlap representation using intervals, the unit right-overlap interval digraphs are precisely the unit interval digraphs, and the adjacency matrices of right-overlap interval digraphs have a simple structural characterization bounding their Ferrers dimension by 3.	adjacency matrix;directed graph	Malay K.

They are derived by considering the associated minimum eigenvalue problem as an optimization problem which seeks the minimum of a quadratic cost function given a hyperspherical constraint. An iterative search procedure is used in which each search path is constrained to lie on the unit hypersphere. Computational complexity per iteration is approximately one-third that of previous adaptive PHR algorithms. Simulations reveal that at low SNR the trial eigenvector can converge to the true minimum eigenvector of the sample covariance matrix, long before this matrix is a good estimate of the true covariance matrix.	pisarenko harmonic decomposition	Daniel R.

IETF Routing Area Working Group (RTGWG) has been working on standardizing IP Fast Reroute (IPFRR) methods with a complete alternate path coverage. In this paper, a trade-off analysis of Multi Topology Routing (MTR) based IPFRR technologies targeting full coverage, namely Multiple Routing Configurations (MRC) and Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT), are presented. We implemented a comprehensive analysis tool to evaluate the performance of MRC and MRT mechanisms on various synthetic network topologies. The performance results show that MRT's alternative path lengths are not scalable with respect to the network size and density while the alternative path lengths of MRC only slightly change as the network size and density vary. We believe that this is an important scalability result providing a guidance in the selection of MTR-based IPFRR mechanism for improving the availability in ISP networks.	algorithm;code coverage;computational complexity theory;denial-of-service attack;dhrystone;fast reroute;internet protocol suite;mtr;network topology;next-generation network;overhead (computing);real-time clock;requirement;routing;scalability;synthetic intelligence;vehicle tracking system	Selcuk Cevher;Mustafa Ulutas;Ibrahim Hökelek	2013	2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6567179	nickel;routing;the internet;next-generation network;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;magnetic resonance imaging;distributed computing;routing protocol;redundancy;network topology;computer network	Networks	-3.16800488226431	84.93080941487979	2101

By allowing b to be negative (b > −2√a), p(x) is concave up for small values of x > 0 as it is for the sigmoidal functional response. We show that in this case there exists a Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation point of codimension 3, which acts as an organizing center for the system. We study the Hopf and homoclinic bifurcations and saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycles of the system. We also describe the bifurcation sequences in each subregion of parameter space as the death rate of the predator is varied. In contrast with the case b ≥ 0, we prove that when −2√a < b < 0, a limit cycle can coexist with a homoclinic loop. The bifurcation sequences involving Hopf bifurcations, homoclinic bifurcations, as well as the saddle-node bifurcations of limit cycles are determined using information from the complete study of the Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation point of codimension 3 and the geometry of the system. Examples of the predicted bifurcation curves are also generated numerically using XPPAUT. Our work extends the results in [F. Rothe and D. S. Shafer, Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect.

Although many methods are provably statistically consistent (i.e. the probability of recovering the correct tree converges to 1 as the sequence length increases), the actual rate of convergence for different methods has not been well understood. In a recent paper we introduced a new method for reconstructing evolutionary trees called the dyadic closure method (DCM), and we showed that DCM has a very fast convergence rate. DCM runs in O(n 5 logn) time, where n is the number of sequences, and so, although polynomial, the computational requirements are potentially too large to be of use in practice. In this paper we present another tree reconstruction method, the witness-antiwitness method (WAM). WAM is faster than DCM, especially on random trees, and converges to the true tree topology at the same rate as DCM. We also compare WAM to other methods used to reconstruct trees, including Neighbor Joining (possibly the most popular method among molecular biologists), and new methods introduced in the computer science literature. @ 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

These grids are commonly used in adaptive mesh refinement of hyperbolic problems. The interface closures are such that the global accuracy of the numerical method is that of the interior stencil. The summation-by-parts property is built into the stencil construction and implies asymptotic stability by the energy method while being non-dissipative. We present one-dimensional closures for fourth-order explicit and compact Pade type, finite differences. Tests on the scalar one- and two-dimensional wave equations, the one-dimensional Navier-Stokes solution of a shock and two-dimensional inviscid compressible vortex verify the accuracy and stability of this class of methods.	adaptive mesh refinement;finite difference;refinement (computing)	R.

We then solve the problem using simple replicator dynamics from evolutionary game theory. Experiments on hundreds of uniformly random trees are presented. The results are impressive: despite the inherent inability of these simple dynamics to escape from local optima, they always returned a globally optimal solution.	game theory;local optimum;maxima and minima;maximal set;one-to-one (data model);tree (data structure)	Marcello Pelillo	2001			mathematical optimization;evolutionary game theory;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;replicator equation;global optimization	Theory	17.717183777180058	21.479078856222237	2109

The proposed hybrid column-driver IC drives a mobile UHD (3840 × 2160) AMOLED panel, with one horizontal time of 7.7 μs at a scan frequency of 60 Hz, simultaneously senses the TFT current for back-end TFT variation compensation. Due to external compensation, a simple 3T1C pixel circuit is employed in each pixel. Accurate current sensing and high panel noise immunity is guaranteed by a proposed current-sensing circuit. By reusing the hybrid column-driver circuitries, the driver embodies an 8 bit current-mode ADC to measure OLED V -I transfer characteristic for OLED luminance-degradation compensation. Measurement results show that the hybrid driving method reduces the maximum current error between two emulated TFTs with a 60 mV threshold voltage difference under 1 gray-level error of 0.94 gray level (37 nA) in 8 bit gray scales from 12.82 gray level (501 nA). The circuit-reused current-mode ADC achieves 0.56 LSB DNL and 0.75 LSB INL.	amoled;active matrix;digital-to-analog converter;diode;display driver;elegant degradation;embedded system;emulator;grayscale;image resolution;least significant bit;noise reduction;oled;pixel;real-time clock;real-time transcription;semiconductor device fabrication;successive approximation adc;thin-film transistor;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display;transfer function	Jun-Suk Bang;Hyunsik Kim;Kiduk Kim;Ohjo Kwon;Choongsun Shin;Joohyung Lee;Gyu-Hyeong Cho	2016	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2015.2504416	aperture;electronic engineering;thin-film transistor;computer science;engineering;sensor;electrical engineering;optoelectronics	EDA	54.09479827190308	48.88402909292867	2115

This processor can generate realistic small sound fields in arbitrary spaces by using ultrasound. The architecture is designed with high-level synthesis as the design methodology. By inputting a description of several design parameters, such as the number of IPs and the order and coefficients of the filters on SystemC, the processer hardware can be synthesized automatically. The total amount of hardware used for the super-directional modulation IP and the 3D sound processing IP is 6,021 Nets and 1,292 LCs.

Traditional waterfilling approach is inefficient for such networks due to the strict requirements on the interference generated to the primary users (PUs). In this paper, we present a solution to an energy-efficient resource allocation problem which maximizes the cognitive radio (i.e., secondary) link capacity taking into account the availability of the subcarriers (and hence the reliability of transmission by cognitive radios) and the limits on total interference generated to the PUs. We consider an energy-aware capacity expression by taking into account another factor called subcarrier availability. Optimizing such an expression saves valuable resources such as battery life by selectively allocating power to underutilized subcarriers. Based on a risk-return model, we formulate a convex optimization problem which incorporates a linear average rate loss function in the optimization objective to include the effect of subcarrier availability. Due to the complex structure of the optimal solution, we propose three suboptimal schemes, namely, the step-ladder, nulling, and scaling schemes. We compare the performances of optimal and suboptimal algorithms with the performance of a classical waterfilling scheme. We conclude that waterfilling, unable to satisfy the interference criterion, performs the worst amongst all the schemes considered in this paper.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;cognitive radio;convex optimization;image scaling;interference (communication);loss function;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;optimization problem;optimizing compiler;performance;requirement;subcarrier	Ziaul Hasan;Gaurav Bansal;Ekram Hossain;Vijay K.

In the proposed scheme, two spare PES are located within four PES, which forms a reconfigurable fault-tolerant module (RFTM). Any spare can functionally replace any one of the primary PES within the R F T M . Since spares are physically close to the PES that they replace, reconfiguration interconnections are short, thw minimizing the performance degradation. W e showed that the new fault tolerant structure, R F T M , not only provides error detection mechanism, but also achieves fault tolerance. W e have developed an error detection and fault location algorithm f o r the R F T M , which makes w e of the information that w only available in our fault tolerant structure, but not available in other local redundancy techniques. Then, a systematic way of fault isolation was presented. A major contribution of this paper is that we approached the error detection, fault location and fault isolation in a unified way within the R F T M .

This paper is an extension of our previous work on statistical-CSI and PrCons. Deterministic constraints at times are infeasible or too expensive to implement, further, the CSI could be imperfect due to limited feedback or improper channel estimation. In such cases, PrCons with low outage probability are a good substitute. To handle the PrCons, a conservative approximation of PrCons resulting in a deterministic formulation is required. In this paper, Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is combined with an Interior Point Method (IPM) to obtain the solution. EVT approach is compared with an existing method based on Bernstein-type inequality (BI). Numerical results show that EVT approach outperforms BI approach.	approximation;channel state information;downtime;extreme value theory;interior point method;multi-user;natural language processing;numerical method;phil bernstein;quality of service;rain fade;risk measure;social inequality;telecommunications link;vector autoregression	Krishna Chitti;Xiaochen Tan;Stephan ten Brink	2014	2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992182	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	36.71758952674551	92.11018115047172	2151
bd26485a282d647e8026dee42acd60c8b4ee7d83	array-based reader anti-collision scheme for highly efficient rfid network applications	network topology;scheduling	Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a technology for identifying objects by radio signal. The reader collision problem is caused by the interrogation zones overlap of multiple readers, and leading to incorrect and unreliable data. This study proposes an array-based reader anti-collision scheme (ARCS) for solving the reader-to-tag interference problem. This mechanism uses array and grouping techniques to schedule the active readers to reduce the read cycle (RC) time. The ‘RC’ and ‘collision ratio (CR)’ measures serve as performance indexes in the proposed scheme. From ‘RC’ comparison, the ARCS mechanism has the maximum improvement of 55 per cent as compared with the existing mechanisms. Furthermore, take ‘CR’ index, ARCS has the maximum improvement of 42 per cent as compared to the others.

In this paper, we study the construction of QC LDPC codes based on an arbitrary given expansion factor (or lifting degree). First, we analyze the cycle structure of QC LDPC codes and give the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of short cycles. Based on the fundamental theorem of arithmetic in number theory, we divide the integer factorization into three cases and present three classes of QC LDPC codes accordingly. Furthermore, a general constructionmethod of QC LDPC codes with girth of at least 6 is proposed. Numerical results show that the constructed QC LDPC codes perform well over the AWGN channel when decoded with the iterative algorithms.

Suppose that the SU's transmitter and receiver are equipped with multiple antennas and the PU's receiver are equipped with single receive antenna. We assume that the SU's channel state information (CSI) is known at the SU transmitter perfectly, however, due to less cooperation between the SU and the PU, only partial CSI between SU and PU is available at the SU transmitter. We seek to determine the optimal transmit signal covariance to maximize the transmission rate of the SU where the covariance is subject to the average interference power constraint of the PU as well as the transmit power constraint of the SU transmitter. Two iterative algorithms are proposed to solve these problems, and it is shown that the algorithms can converge to the optimal solution. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the algorithms.	algorithm;channel state information;cognitive radio;converge;expectation–maximization algorithm;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);iterative method;mimo;second level address translation;simulation;social inequality;subderivative;subgradient method;superuser;transmitter	Lan Zhang;Ying-Chang Liang;Yan Xin	2008	2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)	10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562464	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;control theory	Mobile	37.62305819468258	89.0547130739869	2172

bd9213d384d0318634edfdeb5f5d5aa64ef6c5de	reconfigurable stt-nv lut-based functional units to improve performance in general-purpose processors	performance;design	Unavailability of functional units is a major performance bottleneck in general-purpose processors (GPP). In a GPP with limited number of functional units while a functional unit may be heavily utilized at times, creating a performance bottleneck, the other functional units might be under-utilized. We propose a novel idea for adapting functional units in GPP architecture in order to overcome this challenge. For this purpose, a selected set of complex functional units that might be under-utilized such as multiplier and divider, are realized using a programmable look up table-based fabric. This allows for run-time adaptation of functional units to improving performance. The programmable look up tables are realized using magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) based memories that dissipate near zero leakage and are CMOS compatible. We have applied this idea to a dual issue architecture. The results show that compared to a design with all CMOS functional units a performance improvement of 18%, on average is achieved for standard benchmarks. This comes with 4.1% power increase in integer benchmarks and 2.3% power decrease in floating point benchmarks, compared to a CMOS design.	benchmark (computing);cmos;central processing unit;execution unit;general-purpose modeling;graph partition;lookup table;nv network;performance tuning;spectral leakage;unavailability	Adarsh Reddy Ashammagari;Hamid Mahmoodi;Tinoosh Mohsenin;Houman Homayoun	2014		10.1145/2591513.2591535	embedded system;design;electronic engineering;parallel computing;performance;computer science;operating system	Arch	5.818193675530642	45.94443130976372	2198

This scheme builds upon the usual temporal semidiscretization and a $\Gamma$-convergence approximation of the functionals (in a full discretization, this approximation consists of a sequence of discrete functionals defined on finer and finer discrete spaces). The main new result of this work is a rigorous convergence analysis for this scheme. Interestingly, it turns out that the usual time discretization is incomplete as a basis for a fully discrete approximation of the optimal control problem, and a new nonlocal condition has to be introduced. Since this new condition is necessary and sufficient for a one-to-one correspondence of discrete-time and continuous-time solutions to rate-independent systems, we also gain a new theoretical insight, which might be of independent interest. At the heart of the derivation are so-called reverse approximation results, for which we provide extensions and refinements. To give a concrete example and to demonstrate how the abstract theory can be applied in a concrete problem, we present a full discretization with finite elements of the optimal control problem for a rate-independent partial differential inclusion.	approximation;optimal control	Filip Rindler	2009	SIAM J.

This Paper presents a cooperative localization method based on vision in wireless sensor networks. Based on the video vision characteristics, the distances between sensor nodes in the network are obtained with respect to some 3 chosen nodes whose locations are a- priori known. These in turn allow the estimation of the coordinates of each node. An averaging method is employed to refine the estimation. Some vision experiments are presented that demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and that refinement to the distance estimation.	experiment;refinement (computing)	Sharif Amar Mohamed Sharif;Varun Jeoti	2008	2008 Second Asia International Conference on Modelling &#x00026; Simulation (AMS)	10.1109/AMS.2008.77	computer vision;geography;telecommunications;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network;visual sensor network	Robotics	15.81212680592809	74.26346727423348	2214
be07ed257d70f0672d0a153da1ebc6ee28e2ebc4	survey of photonic and plasmonic interconnect technologies for intra-datacenter and high-performance computing communications		Large scale data centers (DC) and high performance computing (HPC) systems require more and more computing power at higher energy efficiency. They are already consuming megawatts of power, and a linear extrapolation of trends reveals that they may eventually lead to unrealistic power consumption scenarios in order to satisfy future requirements (e.g., Exascale computing). Conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-based electronic interconnects are not expected to keep up with the envisioned future board-to-board and chip-to-chip (within multi-chip-modules) interconnect requirements because of bandwidth-density and power-consumption limitations. However, low-power and high-speed optics-based interconnects are emerging as alternatives for DC and HPC communications; they offer unique opportunities for continued energy-efficiency and bandwidth-density improvements, although cost is a challenge at the shortest length scales. Plasmonics-based interconnects on the other hand, due to their extremely small size, offer another interesting solution for further scaling operational speed and energy efficiency. At the device-level, CMOS compatibility is also an important issue, since ultimately photonics or plasmonics will have to be co-integrated with electronics. In this paper, we survey the available literature and compare the aforementioned interconnect technologies, with respect to their suitability for high-speed and energy-efficient on-chip and off-chip communications. This paper refers to relatively short links with potential applications in the following interconnect distance hierarchy: local group of racks, board to board, module to module, chip to chip, and on chip connections. We compare different interconnect device modules, including low-energy output devices (such as lasers, modulators, and LEDs), photodetectors, passive devices (i.e., waveguides and couplers) and electrical circuitry (such as laserdiode drivers, modulator drivers, transimpedance, and limiting amplifiers). We show that photonic technologies have the potential to meet the requirements for selected HPC and DC applications in a shorter term. We also present that plasmonic interconnect modules could offer ultra-compact active areas, leading to high integration bandwidth densities, and low device capacitances allowing for ultra-high bandwidth operation that would satisfy the application requirements further into the future.	amplifier;auditory processing disorder;cmos;choice behavior;computation (action);data center;detectors;dimensions;electric capacitance;electrical connection;electronic circuit;energy, physics;extrapolation;financial cost;gnu nano;greater than or equal to;image scaling;incremental funding methodology;joule;lasers;low-power broadcasting;medical device incompatibility problem;modulation;modulator device component;network on a chip;numerous;output device;personal identification number;photonics;plasmon;polymer;polymers;rf modulator;reaching;requirement;scalability;semiconductor;short;silicon;small;supercomputer;test scaling;transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation;transmitter device component;density;metal oxide;mycophenolate mofetil;pamidronate;racks	Christos A.

It relies on using a wavelet transmultiplexer that allows for a proper unequal distribution of the transmission power among JP2 coding units according to their contribution to the decoded image quality. In the proposed system, the JP2 stream is divided into a certain number of packet groups and each group is transmitted through a separate sub-channel at a different rate and power. Packet grouping and power distribution is driven by the native JP2 rate-distortion function. The major strength of the proposed method is the flexibility on assigning a different protection level to each source JP2 packet by selecting the transmission power from a continuous range of possible values. The performance of this technique is evaluated in case of AWGN and Rayleigh channels.

In recent work, matrix diagrams built from a Kronecker expression for the transition rate matrix of certain types of GSPNs were shown to allow for more efficient solution; however, the GSPN model requires a special form, so that the transition rate matrix has a Kronecker expression. In this paper, we extend the earlier results to GSPN models with partitioned sets of places. Specifically, we give a more restrictive definition for matrix diagrams and show that the new form is canonical. We then present an algorithm that builds a canonical matrix diagram representation for an arbitrary non-negative matrix, given encodings for the sets of rows and columns. Using this algorithm, a Kronecker expression is not required to construct the matrix diagram. The efficient matrix diagram algorithms for numerical solution presented earlier are still applicable. We apply our technique to several example GSPNs.	algorithm;column (database);diagram;markov chain;model-driven engineering;multidimensional scaling;numerical partial differential equations;stochastic petri net;the matrix;von neumann architecture	Andrew S.

They also conjecture that this is the fastest achievable convergence rate for pointwise D-semifaithful codes.

The path-average rainfall intensity along each microwave radio link is estimated from the rainfall-induced attenuation using an empirical relationship. The proposed algorithm consists of appropriate preprocessing of the links data, followed by a modified weighted least squares algorithm to infer on the rain level at any given point in space. The algorithm can be used to interpolate measurements onto a regular grid to construct a two-dimensional rainfall intensity field. The novelty of the proposed estimation method comes from its ability to be applied on an arbitrary geometry network comprising different microwave links lengths and frequencies and allowing easy integration of rain gauge observations into the model to improve estimation accuracy. The technique has been applied to an existing fixed wireless communication network comprising 22 microwave links covering an area of about 15times15 km2 and operating at carrier frequencies of about 20 GHz. The resulting rainfall field estimates have been compared to rain gauge stations in the vicinity and to weather radar data, showing good agreement.	algorithm;carrier wave;interpolation;least squares;microwave;preprocessor;regular grid;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications network	Oren Goldshtein;Hagit Messer;Artem Zinevich	2009	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2009.2012554	telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;accuracy and precision;environmental monitoring;statistics	Visualization	26.067226726007046	76.77246141860198	2241

Ramanujan numbers are related to IC and integers which are powers of 2. The computational complexity of the algorithms used, for computing a transform of size N, is 0 (I?) addition and shift operations. In these algorithms, the transform can be computed sequentially with a single adder in o($) addition times. Parallel implementation of the algorithm can be executed in 0 ( N ) addition times, with 0 (N) number of adders. Use and properties of Ramanujan numbers of order-1 were discussed in [l]. In this paper, properties of Ramanujan numbers of order-2, and their application to DFT are discussed. For the same range of values of N , DFT computation using Ramanujan numbers of order-2 is generally more accurate than using Ramanujan numbers of order-1. Some of these Ramanujan numbers of order-2 are related to the Biblical and Babylonian values of IC [2].	adder (electronics);computation;computational complexity theory;discrete fourier transform;parallel algorithm;power of two	Nirdosh Bhatnagar	1996		10.1109/ICASSP.1996.543668	multiplication operator;discrete hartley transform;fast fourier transform;combinatorics;number theory;discrete mathematics;computer science;discrete sine transform;discrete fourier transform;signal processing;mathematics;parallel algorithm;discrete fourier transform;shift operator;computational complexity theory;algebra	Crypto	57.594718789289686	21.354652163244115	2243

The finite element approximation is formulated on a bounded computational domain using a nonlocal approximate artificial boundary condition or a local one. In fact there are a family of nonlocal approximate boundary conditions with increasing accuracy (and computational cost) and a family of local ones for a given artificial boundary. Our error estimates show how the errors of the finite element approximations depend on the mesh size, the terms used in the approximate artificial boundary condition, and the location of the artificial boundary. A numerical example for Navier equations outside a circle in the plane is presented. Numerical results demonstrate the performance of our error estimates.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;computation;finite element method;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;numerical method;quantum nonlocality	Houde Han;Weizhu Bao	2001	Math.

02bed2178da73531d6fd521a55d29fa0b400c077	a note on the calculation of moments	moment;moment invariants;corrected discrete formula	Abstract   Moment invariants have found wide applications in image classification, scene matching and objection recognition. It is known that moments, which are used to construct moment invariants, are in general defined in continuous form, but for practical implementation they are computed in discrete form. It is observed that the computations of high-order moments in conventional discrete form result in some unwanted errors in comparison with those in the continuous form. In this note we intend to propose a corrected discrete formula for computing moments more accurately. By applying this corrected formula to calculate the seven famous moment invariants proposed by Hu in 1962, it is shown that there is no effect on the last six moment invariants due to error cancellations. They provide an accurate result for the first one, which is the most important one among these seven moment invariants.

8ae7998d51cde6090fbf095771d6e9ba98b0cc23	demo: electrosense - spectrum sensing with increased frequency range		This demo introduces an expansion board for Electrosense, a system for crowdsourced spectrum monitoring and analysis. The first generation of Electrosense sensor nodes, was based on a low cost Software Defined Radio (SDR) dongle with a frequency range limited to 24 MHz 1.7 GHz. The new generation adds a custom made downconverter that extends the capabilities of the SDR dongle, enabling spectrum monitoring from almost DC up to 6 GHz. The low cost of the proposed sensor nodes allows for a large scale deployment which generates a massive amount of RF spectrum data. A server backend performs storage and data analysis. All the data and the results are available through an public open API.

In order to maximize the long-term utility of the network, the scheduling problem considered in this paper addresses the following question: given an estimate of the current network state, should a source transmit its data directly to the destination or use a relay to help with the transmission? We first develop an upper bound on the performance of any arbitrary scheduler. Next, the optimal scheduling problem is formulated and solved as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), assuming that complete state information about the relays is available at the source nodes. We then relax the assumption of the availability of full state information, and formulate the scheduling problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and show that it can be decomposed into an equivalent MDP problem. Simulation results are used to show the performance of the schedulers.	markov chain;partially observable markov decision process;relay;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation	Huijiang Li;Neeraj Jaggi;Biplab Sikdar	2011	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2011.070711.100778	fair-share scheduling;fixed-priority pre-emptive scheduling;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;two-level scheduling;distributed computing;round-robin scheduling;statistics;computer network	Mobile	14.972058040568495	82.14286499372238	2265

Challenging is a tight integration over small and macro layers. Straight forward is to ensure orthogonality between small and macro cell layers by allocation to different RF frequency bands like e.g. 2.6 and 3.5GHz respectively. Here within the macro layer frequency band an opportunistic tight cooperation between macro and small cell radio stations is being proposed. This requires dual band small cell radio stations operating in a traditional local area frequency band like 3.5GHz for data off loading and simultaneously and on a need basis at e.g. 2.6GHz as performance booster for macro UEs. First high level evaluations indicate significant spectral efficiency, capacity and coverage gains for macro cell users benefiting from higher Rx power and rank enhancement.	booster (electric power);frequency band;high-level programming language;metis;mimo;multipoint ground;radio broadcasting;radio frequency;spectral efficiency	Wolfgang Zirwas	2015			radio frequency;mimo;metis;frequency band;macro;multi-band device;spectral efficiency;electronic engineering;engineering;orthogonality	Networks	25.416963340403857	87.75096115524403	2283

In the original implementation of the QMR method, the Lanczos process with look-ahead is used to generate basis vectors for the underlying Krylov subspaces. In the Lanczos algorithm, these basis vectors are computed by means of three-term recurrences. It has been observed that, in nite precision arithmetic, vector iterations based on three-term recursions are usually less robust than mathematically equivalent coupled two-term vector recurrences. This paper presents a look-ahead algorithm that constructs the Lanczos basis vectors by means of coupled two-term recursions. Implementation details are given, and the look-ahead strategy is described. A new implementation of the QMR method, based on this coupled two-term algorithm, is proposed. A simpliied version of the QMR algorithm without look-ahead is also presented, and the special case of QMR for complex symmetric linear systems is considered. Results of numerical experiments comparing the original and the new implementations of the QMR method are reported.	basis (linear algebra);experiment;iteration;krylov subspace;lanczos algorithm;linear system;newton's method;numerical analysis;recurrence relation;recursion	Roland W.

The text indexing with wildcards problem is to index T such that when we are given a query pattern P , we can locate the occurrences of P in T efficiently. This problem has been applied in indexing genomic sequences that contain single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) because SNP can be modeled as wildcards. Recently Tam et al.

The proposed GA is aimed to solve the joint AS and PA problem by maximizing the channel capacity under a fixed total transmission power constraint. At the first stage of the proposed scheme, we conduct the priority based GA to concurrently select the best transmit/receive antenna set under uniform transmit power allocation. At the second stage, we carry out a real-value GA to find the best power allocation strategy for the selected transmit antennas. Complexity analysis and simulation results are presented to assert that the proposed scheme can outperform existing works in terms of the bit error rate performance, while keeping its computational complexity modest.	genetic algorithm;mimo	Hsien-Sen Hung;Hoang-Yang Lu;Yu-Huei Cheng	2016	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-015-3119-2	mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;computer science;control theory	Mobile	34.706659992573414	90.47345248026346	2323

Such hybrid CMOS-RRAM neuromorphic architectures will result in several orders of magnitude reduction in energy consumption at a very small form factor, and herald autonomous learning machines capable of self-adapting to their environment. However, the progress in this area has been impeded from the realization that the actual memory devices fall well short of their expected behavior. In this work, we discuss the challenges associated with these memory devices and their use in neuromorphic computing circuits, and propose pathways to overcome these limitations by introducing ‘dendritic learning’.	artificial neural network;autonomous robot;benchmark (computing);british informatics olympiad;cmos;computer;convolutional neural network;dendritic spine;low-power broadcasting;machine learning;neuromorphic engineering;non-volatile memory;random access;resistive random-access memory;restricted boltzmann machine;small form factor;spiking neural network;synapse;volatile memory	Xinyu Wu;Vishal Saxena	2017	2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7966299	electronic engineering;computer science;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;neuromorphic engineering	EDA	4.84403276394114	41.56541948671538	2335

Non-uniform channels are encountered in many communication systems, e.g., in a network that different packets are sent through parallel routes; in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, where the codeword bits are modulated in different frequency bins with different SNR; also in multi-input multi-output systems, where different channel pairs have different parameters. We formulate the problem of optimizing the rate of an irregular low-density parity-check code, with guaranteed convergence over such a channel, as an iterative linear-programming. The number of design-parameters for code-design over non-uniform channels is much greater than the number of design-parameters in conventional channels. Therefore, search-based optimization methods are impractical. As a result, a linear-programming approach is significantly more efficient. The methodology of this paper is directly applicable to all decoding algorithms for which an exact or accurate-enough one-dimensional analysis is possible. For other decoding algorithms, we show that the method can still be applied after minor modifications.	algorithm;code word;forward error correction;frequency divider;iterative method;linear programming;low-density parity-check code;mapper;mathematical optimization;modulation;multiplexing;relay;signal-to-noise ratio	Masoud Ardakani	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.254901	frequency modulation;low-density parity-check code;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;convergence;telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;theoretical computer science;dimensional analysis;telephony;communications system	EDA	44.779789606480385	70.54155613289238	2336

4c98f4e42be746ba2f2bba2c1c2a07f2f8508fa1	mac based energy efficiency in cooperative cognitive radio network in the presence of malicious users		In cognitive radio networks, cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is generally adopted for improving spectrum sensing accuracy to increase spectrum utilization and avoid interference with the primary users. However, some malicious secondary users (SUs) may affect the CSS performance by inducing false observation bits for fusion. The message authentication code (MAC) is a promising technique to avoid the damage from the spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks. In this paper, as both the more spectrum sensing nodes and the MAC reporting bits result in extra energy consumption, we propose an energy efficiency model to capture the effects of the length of MAC and the number of cooperative SUs under independent and collaborative SSDF attacks, respectively, and analyze the existence of the optimal length of MAC and the optimal number of cooperative SUs that can achieve the maximum value of energy efficiency, respectively. Simulation results are provided to show that the CSS scheme based on MAC can resist SSDF attacks and the accuracy of the theoretical analysis is also validated.	cascading style sheets;cognitive radio;interference (communication);message authentication code;simulation	Jianxin Dai;Juan Liu;Cunhua Pan;Jiangzhou Wang;Chonghu Cheng;Zhiliang Huang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2793906	computer science;computer network;cognitive radio;distributed computing;efficient energy use;energy consumption;message authentication code	Mobile	35.815749572945414	95.96387359216999	2341

By giving secondary users (SUs) the capability to utilize the licensed channels (LCs) when there are no primary users (PUs) present, the CR increases spectrum utilization and ameliorates the problem of spectrum shortage. However, the absence of a central controller in CR ad hoc network (CRAHN) introduces many challenges in the efficient selection of appropriate data and backup channels. Maintenance of the backup channels as well as managing the sudden appearance of PUs are critical issues for effective operation of CR. In this paper, a prioritized medium access control protocol for CRAHN, PCR-MAC, is developed which opportunistically selects the optimal data and backup channels from a list of available channels. We also design a scheme for reliable switching of a SU from the data channel to the backup channel and vice-versa. Thus, PCR-MAC increases network throughput and decreases SUs’ blocking rate. We also develop a Markov chain-based performance analysis model for the proposed PCR-MAC protocol. Our simulations, carried out in N S−3, show that the proposed PCR-MAC outperforms other state-of-the-art opportunistic medium access control protocols for CRAHNs.	access control;backup;blocking (computing);channel (communications);cognitive radio;hoc (programming language);markov chain;simulation;spectrum analyzer;throughput	Ridi Hossain;Rashedul Hasan Rijul;Md.

afa985aee8fdc9538a9a4be9134ed38172d2bf1f	on an algorithm for multiperiodic words	combinatorics on words	"""We consider an algorithm by Tijdeman and Zamboni constructing a word of length n that has periods p 1 ,. .. , pr, and the richest possible alphabet. We show that this algorithm can be easily stated and its correctness briefly proved using the class equivalence approach. A short (personal) history Non-trivial words with a given set of periods P = {p 1 , p 2 ,. .. , p r } have received a lot of attention in the past decade. The motivation was to generalize the result by Fine and Wilf dealing with two periods, which became part of the folklore. A word with periods P is called trivial if gcd(P) is its period too. Papers [1] and [4] are two (independent) results considering non-trivial such words with maximal length and maximal cardinality of its alphabet. Those papers completed some older research of Castelli, Mignosi, Restivo and Justin (see, e.g., [5] for more details and references). Already in 1998, I wrote a short manuscript giving an analogous result (without considering its publication), which I showed to Sorin Constantinescu during the conference WORDS 2003 in Turku, where he presented their results. Since this was passed without notice in the subsequent publication and since I considered my approach simpler and more natural, I later decided to publish it in [2]. There was a gap in my paper, discovered by Gwénaël Richomme, which is fixed in [3]. The present paper extends the same approach to the construction of the richest word with a given set of periods and a given length. The basic idea is to consider relations defined by the periods and understand letters as (names of) equivalence classes generated by those relations. The idea is obvious and well known, usually expressed using the graph terminology (edges and connected components), rather than the algebraic terminology (relations and equivalence classes). Tijdeman and Zamboni [5] point out that the straightforward algorithm based on the graph approach is """" simple but inefficient """" and then present an algorithm based on less transparent combinatorial analysis. The aim of this paper is to give a short description of their algorithm, as well as a short and intuitive proof of its correctness, using consistently the graph/equivalence viewpoint. Let w be a word of length n over an alphabet A. The set of all letters that occur in w is denoted by alph(w).

Compared with the traditional rational interpolation based on continued fraction, the barycentric blending interpolation inherited the advantages of the simple expressions, has many advantages such as small calculation quantity, good numerical stability, no poles and unattainable points, etc. The barycentric blending interpolation can also be extended to both higher dimensions, vector-valued case and matrix-valued case.	alpha compositing;barycentric subdivision;interpolation	Qiang Li;Feng Xu	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-37502-6_73	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;interpolation;stairstep interpolation;mathematics;geometry;linear interpolation;nearest-neighbor interpolation;trilinear interpolation	Visualization	71.91236280861104	15.49845458566273	2346

Different from best-effort traffic in Internet, bulk data transfer in grid requires bandwidth reservation as a fundamental service. Existing reservation schemes such as RSVP are designed for real-time traffic specified by reservation rate, transfer start time but with unknown lifetime. In comparison, bulk data transfer requests are defined in terms of volume and deadline, which provide more information, and allow more flexibility in reservation schemes, i.e., transfer start time can be flexibly chosen, and reservation for a single request can be divided into multiple intervals with different reservation rates. We define a flexible reservation framework using time-rate function algebra, and identify a series of practical reservation scheme families with increasing generality and potential performance, namely, FixTime-FixRate, FixTime-FlexRate, FlexTimeFlexRate, and Multi-Interval. Simple heuristics are used to select representative scheme from each family for performance comparison. Simulation results show that the increasing flexibility can potentially improve system performance, minimizing both blocking probability and mean flow time. We also discuss the distributed implementation of proposed framework.	best-effort delivery;blocking (computing);data-intensive computing;erlang (unit);gigabit;grid network;heuristic (computer science);real-time computing;real-time transcription;resource reservation protocol;simulation;terabit	Bin Bin Chen;Pascale Vicat-Blanc Primet	2006	CoRR		best-effort delivery;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	1.8810344930117084	95.86861236718892	2348

This strategy imposes a threshold on the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) of mobile users to reduce the feedback load. The basestation only uses those beams that are requested by feedback users. The exact analytical expression of the sum rate of proposed strategy is developed, based on which the threshold is optimized to maximize the sum rate. With optimal thresholds, we demonstrate through numerical examples that the proposed strategy achieve a better sum-rate performance than existing scheduling strategies over high SNR region.	beamforming;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;numerical analysis;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio	Peng Lu;Hong-Chuan Yang	2008	2008 IEEE 68th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2008.117	probability density function;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;probability;mathematics;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;scheduling;wireless;statistics;mimo	Mobile	38.29204462613153	85.86677590576716	2349

The considered IFC consists of multiple source-destination pairs. Each destination splits its received signal into two parts for information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), respectively. Each pair adjusts its transmit power and power splitting ratio to meet both the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and EH constraints at its corresponding destination. To characterize rational behaviors of source-destination pairs, we formulate a noncooperative game for the considered system, where each pair is modeled as a strategic player who aims to minimize its own transmit power under both SINR and EH constraints at the destination. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the formulated game. The best response strategy of each player is derived, and then the NE can be achieved iteratively. Numerical results show that the proposed game-theoretic approach can achieve a near-optimal performance under various SINR and EH constraints.	exception handling;exponential hierarchy;game theory;interference (communication);nash equilibrium;numerical method;quality of service;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	He Chen;Yuanye Ma;Zihuai Lin;Yonghui Li;Branka Vucetic	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2536734	game theory;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	33.18804383355413	93.6562260343273	2369

Industrial customers connected to the distribution grid were interviewed regarding their sensitivity towards interruptions and how the cost related to the duration of the interruption, focusing on the individual customer. Most former surveys have looked at average values over a number of customers within the same group. Some applications of the information gathered in this way are discussed, also related to the smart grid concept. One important conclusion that can be drawn from the study is that the interruption cost for each individual customer needs to be investigated.	interrupt	Mikael Wamundson;Johan Höglund;Math H. J.

Given the channel and a SISO equalization algorithm, one method explored is to analytically compute the bit-error rate (BER) of the SISO equalizer in two extreme cases (no and perfect a priori information) from which a BER transfer characteristic is estimated. The second approach is to compute the mutual information [a key parameter of the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart] at the two end points of the EXIT function. Then, by modeling the SISO equalizer BER transfer and EXIT functions as linear, some of the behavior of linear turbo equalization, such as how the BER performance can be improved as iterations proceed, can be predicted. Further, soft information evolution characteristics of different linear SISO equalizers can be compared and the usefulness of iterative methods such as linear turbo equalization for a given channel can be determined. Compared with existing methods for generating EXIT functions, these predictive methods provide insight into the iterative behavior of linear turbo equalizers with substantial reduction in numerical complexity.	algorithm;bit error rate;computer simulation;exit chart;equalization (communications);iteration;iterative method;linear interpolation;mutual information;norm (social);numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder;systems design;transfer function;turbo equalizer;x.690	Seok-Jun Lee;Andrew C.

One way to address these challenges is to use storage devices that can store surplus energy from RESs and discharge the energy back to the grid when needed. Researchers have recently introduced the idea to use electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capability, which are called “gridable vehicles” (GVs), as storage devices in the smart grid. Using GVs as loads is well accepted, but as sources, they disrupt system reliability if insufficient GVs are available for discharging when needed. An availability planning model is thus required to address this issue. GV owners' concern over battery lifetime reductions is another issue that impedes the required participation rates for GVs in vehicle-to-grid discharge programs. In this paper, we present an intelligent smart grid system model, which mitigates real-time unavailability of GV sources via an availability planning model. We also propose a GV selection model that prevents GV batteries from premature expiry due to their vehicle-to-grid operations. Simulation results confirm that our proposed models maintain better overall reliability and increase average battery lifetime by up to 3.5 years compared with existing vehicle-to-grid models.	advanced power management;discharger;real-time clock;rechargeable battery;simulation;unavailability;uninterruptible power supply;unmanned aerial vehicle	Uttam Kumar Debnath;Iftekhar Ahmad;Daryoush Habibi;Ahmed Yousuf Saber	2015	IEEE Systems Journal	10.1109/JSYST.2013.2294734	embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;smart grid	EDA	2.790466607996795	6.092731138071913	2410

This extends work of Shields (1993), whose examples had O entropy. The class of B-processes, that is, stationary codings of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) processes, includes the aperiodic Markov chains and functions thereof, aperiodic renewal and regenerative processes, and m-dependent processes, as well as many other processes of interest. In particular, the results show that the search for a universal redundancy rate for the class of all B-processes is doomed to failure, and redundancy rates for any given subclass must be obtained by direct analysis of that subclass. >		Paul C.

Two novel distributed controllers are proposed with which the convergence time of the tracking errors is globally bounded for any initial condition of the agents. When relative state measurements are available for each follower, an observer-based distributed control strategy is proposed which achieves fixed-time coordinated tracking for the perturbed second-order multi-agent systems. When only relative output measurements are available, uniform robust exact differentiators are employed together with the observer-based controller which is able to achieve fixed-time coordinated tracking with reduced measurements. Simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controllers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It is necessary to have an across-the-board view of the microgrid integration in power systems.

In contrast to input design with signal power constraints, this problem is non-convex and non-smooth. We propose an iterative solution: in the first step, a convex optimization problem is solved for input design under power constraints. In subsequent steps, the constraints considered are the p-norms of the input and output signals, p increases for each iteration step. This is an adaptation of the classical Pólya algorithm for function approximation, which has previously been used for the related problem of signal crest-factor optimization. Although the difficulty of the problem prevents a proof of optimality, the performance of the algorithm is discussed with reference to a simple example.	algorithm;approximation;constrained optimization;converge;convex optimization;feedback;global optimization;input/output;iteration;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;pólya enumeration theorem;system identification	Ian R.

Also, a test is available, a@? priori, to determine when x@?^* a destination point. This paper generalizes earlier work by the first author by introducing an asymmetric Euclidean distance in which, at each destination, the x-component is weighted differently from the y-component. A Weiszfeld algorithm is studied to compute x@?^* and is shown to be a descent method which is globally convergent (except possibly for a denumerable number of starting points). Local convergence properties are characterized. When x@?^* is not a destination point the iteration matrix at x@?^* is shown to be convergent and local convergence is always linear. When x@?^* is a destination point, local convergence can be linear, sub-linear or super-linear, depending upon a computable criterion. A test, which does not require iteration, for x@?^* to be a destination, is derived. Comparisons are made between the symmetric and asymmetric problems. Numerical examples are given.	algorithm;fermat;geometric median	I. Norman Katz;Steven R.

The algorithm uses multiple (two will be used as an example) dictionaries for storing previously encountered strings of the data file to be compressed. The first dictionary is a short one; it has 128 entries and needs seven bits as its address. The second dictionary is a long one; it has 32,768 entries and requires 15 bits as its address. Each of these two dictionaries is initialized with frequently occurring strings. An input data file is compared with the dictionaries so that the longest substring which can be found in a dictionary will give its position in the dictionary as an output code. Compression and expansion use the same procedure to form and update dictionaries. A compressed result consists of a series of pointers to the dictionaries with a byte as a pointer to the short dictionary and two bytes as a pointer to the long dictionary. During compression/expansion, the more frequently occurring strings will be dynamically swapped into the short dictionary. The two dictionaries are used as scratch pads during the time of program execution and need not be stored/transmitted otherwise.	algorithm;byte;data compression;dictionary;pointer (computer programming);scratch (programming language);string (computer science);substring;time formatting and storage bugs	Daniel K.

ee8c990b4f59b05e8fd30d643ae03254f53dc988	on the packing coloring of undirected and oriented generalized theta graphs		The packing chromatic number χρ(G) of an undirected (respectively, oriented) graph G is the smallest integer k such that its set of vertices V (G) can be partitioned into k disjoint subsets V1, . . . , Vk, in such a way that every two distinct vertices in Vi are at distance (respectively directed distance) greater than i in G for every i, 1 ≤ i ≤ k. The generalized theta graph Θ 1,..., p consists of two end-vertices joined by p ≥ 2 internally vertex-disjoint paths with respective lengths 1 ≤ 1 ≤ · · · ≤ p. We prove that the packing chromatic number of any undirected generalized theta graph lies between 3 and max{5, n3+2}, where n3 = |{i / 1 ≤ i ≤ p, i = 3}|, and that both these bounds are tight. We then characterize undirected generalized theta graphs with packing chromatic number k for every k ≥ 3. We also prove that the packing chromatic number of any oriented generalized theta graph lies between 2 and 5 and that both these bounds are tight.	graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;orientation (graph theory);set packing;theta graph;vertex (geometry)	Laïche Daouya;Isma Bouchemakh;Éric Sopena	2016	Australasian J.

Given time tables from systems with thousands of trains, we are to visualize basic properties of the connection structure represented in a so-called train graph. It contains a vertex for each station met by any train, and one edge between every pair of vertices connected by some train running from one station to the other without halting in between. Positions of vertices in a train graph visualization are given by the geographical location of the corresponding station. If all edges are represented by straight-lines, the result is visual clutter with many overlaps and small angles between pairs of lines. We therefore present a non-uniform approach using different representations for edges of distinct meaning in the exploration of the data. Some edges are represented by curved lines, such that the layout problem consists of placing control points for these curves. We transform it into a graph layout problem and exploit the generality of the random field layout model formulation for its solution.

The conventional group detection (GD) suffers from a considerable performance loss since the noise components are not taken into account. The proposed method further enhances the detection performance than the conventional GD by considering the noise correlation. To prevent the noise enhancement problem, the proposed combiner design utilizes a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) maximization criterion for each desired subgroup. In addition, we investigate an effect of group selection based on the received SINR. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a performance gain of 4 dB at a frame error rate (FER) of 10-2 over the conventional GD with four transmit and four receive antennas.	complexity;computer performance;diplexer;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);mimo;power dividers and directional couplers;sensor;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;spatial multiplexing	Jeongsik Jeong;Heunchul Lee;Sung Hyun Moon;Inkyu Lee	2008	2008 IEEE 68th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2008.124	group selection;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;electronic engineering;design methods;telecommunications;noise;control theory;mathematics;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial multiplexing;statistics;mimo	Mobile	45.86676362639994	78.17720502749862	2445

This system is described by an infinite dimensional model given by the first continuity equation of the well-known one-dimensional Saint-Venant equations. Infiltration process is also taken account in this work by using the so-called Green-Ampt model. The adjoint model is obtained by means of a variational approach. Both the system and adjoint equations are numerically solved by using the nonlinear implicit Preissmann scheme. From the combination between the steepest descent method and a line search method, the cost functional is optimized in order to estimate the mentioned initial conditions from a set of lumped observation values. Finally, a simulation example with a simple overland flow and infiltration in a variable rainfall period is presented in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution.	calculus of variations;coefficient;computer simulation;experiment;gradient descent;initial condition;line search;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;scott continuity;simulation;taylor–green vortex;whole earth 'lectronic link	Van Tri Nguyen;Didier Georges;Gildas Besançon	2014	2014 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2014.6981602	mathematical optimization;adjoint equation;hydrology;calculus;mathematics	Robotics	94.66089550151924	13.586576509713584	2460

By de-multiplexing the 3-level Delta-Sigma-quantized signal into two bi-level streams, an efficiency enhancement over the operational frequency range is achieved. The de-multiplexed signals drive a dual-branch amplification block composed of two switch-mode back-to-back power amplifiers working at peak power. A signal processing technique known as quantization noise reduction with In-band Filtering (QNRIF) is applied to each of the de-multiplexed streams to boost the overall performances; particularly the Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR). After amplification, the two branches are combined using a non-isolated combiner, preserving the efficiency of the transmitter. A comprehensive study on the operation of this topology and signal characteristics used to drive the dual-branch Switch-Mode Power Amplifiers (SMPAs) was established. Moreover, this work proposes a highly efficient design of the amplification block based on a back-to-back power topology performing a dynamic load modulation exploiting the non-overlapping properties of the de-multiplexed Complex DSM signal. For experimental validation, the proposed de-multiplexed 3-level Delta-Sigma topology was implemented on the BEEcube™ platform followed by the back-to-back Class-E switch-mode power amplification block. The full transceiver is assessed using a 4th-Generation mobile communications standard LTE (Long Term Evolution) standard 1.4 MHz signal with a peak to average power ratio (PAPR) of 8 dB. The dual-branch topology exhibited a good linearity and a coding efficiency of the transmitter chain higher than 72% across the band of frequency from 1.8 GHz to 2.7 GHz.	adjacent channel power ratio;algorithmic efficiency;amplifier;anatomy, regional;baseband;biological evolution;black and burst;compaq lte;delta aminolevulinate:scnc:pt:urine:qn;delta-sigma modulation;dual;etsi satellite digital radio;frequency band;line code;megahertz;multiplexing;noise reduction;performance;power architecture platform reference;power dividers and directional couplers;processing (action);prototype;p–n junction;quantization (signal processing);sinadr;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral leakage;transceiver device component;transmitter device component;sensor (device)	Anis Ben Arfi;Fahmi M.

Recently, the most preferred method for this matter is the Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) method. In this paper, different techniques for enhancing the TDOA results are introduced. They generally give an idea about the challenges of TDOA. We analyze different ways of using consecutive measurements as well as redundant sensors. We do that focusing on one specific algorithm using TDOA measurements, the residual weighting algorithm (RWA). Its main advantages lie in the low computational complexity and the fact that it doesn't require additional a priori information. We analyze the performance of the algorithm through simulation of different scenarios and present the most preferable application. We show what kind of additional averaging could be used to enhance the results.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;least squares;multilateration;sensor;simulation;transmitter	Noha El Gemayel;Simon Meier;Friedrich Jondral	2012	2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems	10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459654	mathematical optimization;transmitter;computer science;time of arrival;mathematics;maximum likelihood;fdoa;computational complexity theory;statistics	ML	51.51683424843759	5.595812671044027	2473

For example, high-quality C2 surfaces that obey boundary conditions on positions, tangents and curvatures can be conveniently defined as solutions of high-order geometric PDEs; the advantage of such a formulation is its conceptual representation-independence. In practice, solving high-order problems efficiently and accurately for surfaces approximated by meshes is notoriously difficult. Classical FEM approaches require high-order elements which are complex to construct and expensive to compute. Recent discrete geometric schemes are more efficient, but their convergence properties are hard to analyze, and they often lack a systematic way to impose boundary conditions. In this paper, we present an approach to discretizing common PDEs on meshes using mixed finite elements, where additional variables for the derivatives in the problem are introduced. Such formulations use first-order derivatives only, allowing a discretization with simple linear elements. Various boundary conditions can be naturally discretized in this setting. We formalize continuous region constraints, and show that these seamlessly fit into the mixed framework. We demonstrate mixed FEM in the context of diverse modeling tasks and analyze its effectiveness and convergence behavior.	approximation algorithm;blackwell (series);compiler;discretization;eurographics;experiment;finite element method;first-order predicate;geometric modeling;integer factorization;interpolation;lumpers and splitters;piecewise linear continuation;variational principle;vergence	Alec Jacobson;Elif Tosun;Olga Sorkine-Hornung;Denis Zorin	2010	Comput.

Our testbed is intended for quantitative performance assessments of DTN application and protocol implementations in realistic scenarios. We illustrate the practicality of our emulation testbed through a series of experiments with the DTN2 and IBR-DTN implementations, focusing on mobility in urban environments.

We assume that the characteristics of the traffic classes are time varying: at each point in time, a traffic class is described by a process randomly selected from within a set of non parametrically defined stochastic processes.For the wireless environment described above, we compare two multiplexing transmission techniques: a dynamic Time-Division-Based and a dynamic CDMA-Based techniques, in terms of a number of pertinent performance metrics. The dynamics of both techniques manifest themselves as dynamic capacity allocations to the various traffic classes and are implemented via the deployment of a Robust Traffic Monitoring Algorithm (RTMA). The performance metrics studied include delays, traffic rejection rates and wasted capacity rates. Qualitatively speaking, a major controlling factor in the choice among the Time-Division-Based and the CDMA-Based techniques is the speed of the transmission channel: high speeds favor CDMA-Based transmissions.	algorithm;channel (communications);multiplexing;randomness;rejection sampling;relevance;software deployment;stochastic process	Anthony Burrell;Panayota Papantoni-Kazakos	2003		10.1145/948542.948556	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;computer network	Metrics	-2.0488736826735705	97.44403070327016	2484

INTRODUCTION ESEARCH on public key algorithms has been conR cerned mainly with security aspects. The results of this research have induced sufficient confidence to apply public key cryptography on a larger scale. The I S 0 and CCITT have been discussing public key systems. As an example, take the CCITT directory authentication framework [12], which refers to a public key algorithm. (Precisely which algorithm will be used is left for discussion, although RSA is obviously a prime candidate.) ISDN can create new applications for public key algorithms if their implementations can meet requirements ranging from bit rate (from 64 kbits/s up to 140 Mbits/s), to storage and chip area, to physical security. Realizations of some of the most popular public key algorithms rely essentially on efficient exponentiation. In the RSA algorithm, encryption and decryption are performed by exponentiation modulo a large integer N . Exponentiation will be decomposed into a square-and-multiply algorithm. In modular integer arithmetic, squaring is usually as difficult as multiplication. Hence, we will only deal with the second. Binary representation of numbers suggests using a shift-and-add algorithm for multiplication. Reduction modulo N is usually performed after each shift-and-add step. To perform addition efficiently, the propagation of carries has to be controlled. This can be done by carry-look-ahead techniques [33] . Because of the area required. this architecture cannot be extended to an arbitrary length of look-ahead. Alternatively, a redundant delayed-carry representation can be used [9], [29], [ 3 5 ] . The carries have to be resolved only at the end of a multiplication. An alternative is Bucci’s method [ 101, which takes multiplication itself as a primitive operation. and computes the modulus by a series of multiplications, and cuts off the least significant bits (Isb’s). The Diffie-Hellman key exchange system and the ElGamal public key system are both based on exponentiation in a finite field G F ( q ) . For q prime, the considerations for modular integer arithmetics apply again. New aspects arise in the case q = 2 ” .

In order to identify and control the system oscillation modes efficiently, the dynamic behavior of various wide areas, it becomes necessary synchrophasor measurement techniques for real time observability and control, essential requirements which plays a key role in wide area monitoring and damping control systems. This paper proposes a methodology for site selection for a reduced number of phasor measurement units (PMU), which are to serve as real-time data providers for a pilot project of wide-area measurement system (WAMS) that is going to be installed in the Brazilian National Grid. The main constructive and operational characteristics of the PMU technology and WAMS platform are discussed as well as the Brazilian system and its particularities highlighting the large interconnections and major power plants.)	cns disorder;control system;deuterium exchange measurement;ibm power systems;laser therapy, low-level;neural oscillation;pmu/ack _ revoke certificate/permission;phasor;pilot projects;power management unit;preparation;real-time data;requirement;simulation;system of measurement;endodeoxyribonuclease nari	Maynara A.

We show that if a homotopy class has combinatorial length L, then its number of essential self-intersections is bounded by (L − 2)2/4 if L is even, and (L − 1)(L − 3)/4 if L is odd. The classes attaining this bound can be explicitly described in terms of the generators; there are (L − 2)2 + 4 of them if L is even, and 2(L − 1)(L − 3) + 8 if L is odd. Similar descriptions and counts are given for classes with self-intersection number equal to one less than the bound. Proofs use both combinatorial calculations and topological operations on representative curves. Computer-generated data are tabulated counting, for each non-negative integer, how many length-L classes have that self-intersection number, for each length L less than or equal to 13. Such experiments led to the results above. Experimental data are also presented for the pair-of-pants surface.	computer-generated holography;experiment;quadratic function	Moira Chas;Anthony Phillips	2010	Experimental Mathematics	10.1080/10586458.2010.10129073	combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;topology;intersection number;mathematics;geometry;fundamental group;algebra	AI	41.23054400449416	33.09232726462619	2500

73d7e80985ff1f06d812071d68fd39d72f41ac4f	randomized incremental construction for the hausdorff voronoi diagram revisited and extended		The Hausdorff Voronoi diagram of clusters of points in the plane is a generalization of Voronoi diagrams based on the Hausdorff distance function. Its combinatorial complexity is (O(n+m)), where n is the total number of points and (m) is the number of crossings between the input clusters ((m=O(n^2))); the number of clusters is k. We present efficient algorithms to construct this diagram via the randomized incremental construction (RIC) framework [Clarkson et al. 89,93]. For non-crossing clusters ((m=0)), our algorithm runs in expected (O(nlog {n} + klog n log k)) time and deterministic O(n) space. For arbitrary clusters the algorithm runs in expected (O((m+nlog {k})log {n})) time and (O(m+nlog {k})) space. The two algorithms can be combined in a crossing-oblivious scheme within the same bounds. We show how to apply the RIC framework efficiently to handle non-standard characteristics of generalized Voronoi diagrams, including sites (and bisectors) of non-constant complexity, sites that are not enclosed in their Voronoi regions, empty Voronoi regions, and finally, disconnected bisectors and Voronoi regions. The diagram finds direct applications in VLSI CAD.	hausdorff dimension;randomized algorithm;voronoi diagram	Elena Khramtcova;Evanthia Papadopoulou	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-62389-4_27	combinatorics;weighted voronoi diagram;voronoi diagram;binary logarithm;hausdorff distance;topology;mathematics;hausdorff space	Theory	31.249622919117737	19.662658608436608	2502

Specifically, the paper describes an IMS which was set up in Manja Township, City of Blantyre based on an advanced irrigation scheduling technique. Since the system had to be self-sustained in terms of power, which is a challenge for deployment in rural areas of developing countries like Malawi where grid power supply is scarce, we used solar Photovoltaic (PV) and rechargeable batteries to power all electrical devices in this system. The system incorporated a remote monitoring mechanism through a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) modem to report soil temperature, soil moisture, WSN link performance and PV power levels. Irrigation valves were activated to water the field. Our preliminary results have revealed engineering weakness of deploying such a system. Nevertheless, the paper shows that it is possible to develop a robust, fully-automated, solar powered, and low cost IMS to suit the socio-economic conditions of small scale farmers in developing countries.	communications satellite;irrigation informatics;management system;modem;mysql;open-source software;php;power supply;pumping (computer systems);rechargeable battery;scheduling (computing);sensor;software deployment	Million Mafuta;Marco Zennaro;Antoine B.

This paper is mainly concerned with finding the least-squares bi-symmetric solutions of matrix inverse problem AX = B with a submatrix constraint, where X and B are given matrices of suitable sizes. Moreover, in the corresponding solution set, the analytical expression of the optimal approximation solution to a given matrix A* is derived. A direct method for finding the optimal approximation solution is described in detail, and three numerical examples are provided to show the validity of our algorithm.

The construction is based on employing Gauss periods. It is shown that in this case elements of the sequences are algebraic numbers defined by irreducible polynomials over Z of degree 12 (for the first family) and 6 (for the second family). In turn, these polynomials are factorized in some extension of the field Q into polynomials of degree, respectively, 4 and 2, which are written explicitly. For p = 13, using the exhaustive search method, full classification of unimodular sequences with zero autocorrelation is given.	algebraic equation;autocorrelation;brute-force search;gauss–kronrod quadrature formula;gauss–seidel method;irreducibility;irreducible polynomial;turing completeness;unimodular polynomial matrix	Ernst M.

Increase in dynamic power due to always-on pull-up pMOS in the pseudo nMOS structure is mitigated by introducing a feedback path. As a result, with less than 40% power overhead, the PNSA shows approximate twice better performance compared to the conventional domino sensing scheme.	approximation algorithm;high availability;nmos logic;overhead (computing);sense amplifier;single-ended signaling;static random-access memory	Hanwool Jeong;Taewon Kim;Seong-ook Jung;Taejoong Song;Gyu-Hong Kim	2014	2014 21st IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems (ICECS)	10.1109/ICECS.2014.7049989	embedded system;electronic engineering;nmos logic;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	17.42309406929455	59.24556091080195	2513

However, due to the complex and varied indoor scattering environment, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation seriously affects the accuracy of positioning. In this paper, we investigate the NLOS propagation identification for time difference of arrival (TDOA) based positioning in indoor environment. We analyze the correlations between measured distances based on TDOA and select measured distances to identify NLOS data. A new NLOS classification method is proposed based on machine learning to improve positioning accuracy. Numerical results demonstrate the performance of the proposed positioning method.

For the purpose of enhancing the successful delivery ratio for time-sensitive sensor messages and also avoiding congestion around the sinks, the proposed scheme keeps their loads different, and makes each sensor node send the urgent message to the low-load sink. For a neutral node, the urgency of a message is estimated by comparing the slack value of the message and slack distribution of overall messages observed at the node. With this information, each node decides the destination of each message. The simulation performed via ns-2 reveals that the proposed scheme, called chop partition, can improve the deadline meet ratio of real-time messages by up to 7.2% for AODV case and 8.2% for DSDV case, compared with the random selection scheme, or even partition, for the given experiment parameters.	hoc (programming language);network congestion;real-time clock;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);sensor node;simulation;slack variable	Junghoon Lee;Gyung-Leen Park;Shafqat Ur Rehman	2009		10.1145/1529282.1529349	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	8.737140690123711	82.44580974131316	2520

The video compression algorithm used in this paper is in compliance with the general MPEG syntax and bit-stream definition. The coding algorithm distinguishes three types of blocks depending on the level of motion activity in a field intrafield blocks for very high motion, motion-compensatable interfield blocks for medium motion, and differential pulsecode modulation (DPCM) interfield blocks for low motion. Additionally, refreshing fields are used periodically to minimize the error accumulation, where all blocks in the field are coded using intrafield discrete-cosine-transform (DCT) coding. We study the temporal behavior and probability densities of 1) the number of each type of block per field, 2) the number of bits used to code each type of block in each field, 3) the total number of bits from each type of block per field, and 4) the total number of bits per field and examine the dependencies between these variables. We derive a composite model to represent the number of bits per field for the encoded video traffic that comprises multiple autoregressive models for the number of blocks per field and the number of bits in each coded block. We compare the statistics measured from a sample video sequence to those obtained by our model and observe that the model captures the coded video behavior for each block type and their combination reasonably well. This model can be used to further study the cell-generation process of full-motion video codecs and the aggregation of such video sources at the statistical multiplexers.	algorithm;autoregressive model;bitstream;codec;data compression;discrete cosine transform;encoder;full motion video;modulation;moving picture experts group;multiplexer;tree accumulation	Bijan Jabbari;Ferit Yegenoglu;Y.

In its most general form, a data stream is actually an update stream, i.e., comprising data-item deletions as well as insertions. Such massive update streams arise naturally in several application domains (e.g., monitoring of large IP network installations or processing of retail-chain transactions). Estimating the cardinality of set expressions defined over several (possibly distributed) update streams is perhaps one of the most fundamental query classes of interest; as an example, such a query may ask “what is the number of distinct IP source addresses seen in passing packets from both router R 1 and R 2 but not router R 3?”. Earlier work only addressed very restricted forms of this problem, focusing solely on the special case of insert-only streams and specific operators (e.g., union). In this paper, we propose the first space-efficient algorithmic solution for estimating the cardinality of full-fledged set expressions over general update streams. Our estimation algorithms are probabilistic in nature and rely on a novel, hash-based synopsis data structure, termed ”2-level hash sketch”. We demonstrate how our 2-level hash sketch synopses can be used to provide low-error, high-confidence estimates for the cardinality of set expressions (including operators such as set union, intersection, and difference) over continuous update streams, using only space that is significantly sublinear in the sizes of the streaming input (multi-)sets. Furthermore, our estimators never require rescanning or resampling of past stream items, regardless of the number of deletions in the stream. We also present lower bounds for the problem, demonstrating that the space usage of our estimation algorithms is within small factors of the optimal. Finally, we propose an optimized, time-efficient stream synopsis (based on 2-level hash sketches) that provides similar, strong accuracy-space guarantees while requiring only guaranteed logarithmic maintenance time per update, thus making our methods applicable for truly rapid-rate data streams. Our results from an empirical study of our synopsis and estimation techniques verify the effectiveness of our approach.	application domain;approximation algorithm;cardinality (data modeling);data structure;game demo;network security;resampling (statistics);router (computing);space–time tradeoff;stream (computing);video synopsis	Sumit Ganguly;Minos N.

Delay budgeting has been widely exploited to improve the design quality. We present an optimal integer delay budgeting algorithm. Due to numerical instability and discreteness of libraries of components during library mapping in design optimization flow, integer solution for delay budgeting is essential. We prove that integer budgeting problem - a 20-year old open problem in design optimization [7]- can be solved optimally in polynomial time. We applied optimal delay budgeting in mapping applications on FPGA platform using pre-optimized cores of FPGA libraries. For each application we go through synthesis and place and route stages in order to obtain accurate results. Our optimal algorithm outperforms ZSA algorithm [3] in terms of area by 10% on average for all applications. In some applications, optimal delay budgeting can speedup runtime of place_and_route up to 2 times.	algorithm;computation;directed acyclic graph;field-programmable gate array;instability;lagrangian relaxation;library (computing);linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;multidisciplinary design optimization;numerical stability;offset binary;place and route;solver;speedup;time complexity	Elaheh Bozorgzadeh;Soheil Ghiasi;Atsushi Takahashi;Majid Sarrafzadeh	2003		10.1145/775832.776064	time complexity;embedded system;mathematical optimization;logic synthesis;real-time computing;multidisciplinary design optimization;directed graph;integer programming;design methods;computer science;theoretical computer science;place and route;directed acyclic graph;algorithm;wireless;field-programmable gate array	EDA	14.516559897546863	49.0736184678993	2540

WSN becomes more and more popular research area because of its usefulness and huge demand. Since energy resource in WSN is limited, the design of a WSN system should consider energy effectiveness as well as fulfilling application requirements. The effectiveness of the system totally depends on its application and hardware specifications; thus, the routing algorithm of WSN must be optimized to achieve the energy effective communication. The proposed algorithm Energy Consumption-oriented Route Selection (ECORS) is the route selection algorithm attempting to prolong the system lifetime, especially for data collection application. In this paper, the suitable mechanism for data collection is proposed with focusing on implementation, which includes the actual packet transactions mechanism and the improved function for selecting routes in an assumed environment. By modifying the parameters with the thought of implementation, proposed mechanism can extend the lifetime 2.03 times longer than the fixed routing scenario. Furthermore, the simulation result is analyzed in detail with focusing on state of charge variation on each node. Moreover, the new indicator to depict the relationship between lifetime expansion rate and parameters used for the algorithm is introduced. By using this indicator, lifetime expansion rate can be assumed without simulation, which is helpful for implementation.	network packet;requirement;routing;selection algorithm;simulation;smart city;state of charge	Tadanori Matsui;Hiroaki Nishi	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)	10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778729	real-time computing;simulation;engineering;computer security	Mobile	9.614942720750363	81.18806172320625	2552

Design decisions like the selection of the network topology, routing algorithm, fault tolerance and/or congestion control are crucial for the network performance. Besides, the interconnection network designers are also focused on creating middleware layers compatible to different network technologies, which make it possible for these technologies to interoperate. One example is the OpenFabrics Software (OFS) used in HPC for breakthrough applications that require high efficiency computing, wire-speed messaging, microsecond latencies and fast I/O for storage and file systems. OFS is compatible with several HPC interconnect technologies, like InfiniBand, iWarp or RoCE. One challenge in the design of new features for improving the interconnection network performance is to model in specific simulation tools the latency introduced by the OFS modules into the network traffic. In this paper, we present a work-in-progress methodology to combine the OFS middleware with OMNeT++-based simulation tools, so that we can use some of the OFS modules, like OpenSM or ibsim, combined with simulation tools. We also propose a set of tools for analyzing the properties of different network topologies. Future work will consist on modeling other OFS modules functionality in network simulators.	algorithm;deadlock;electrical connection;fault tolerance;iwarp;infiniband;input/output;interaction;interconnection;interoperability;middleware;network congestion;network model;network performance;network topology;network traffic control;operating system;rdma over converged ethernet;routing;simulation	German Maglione Mathey;Pedro Yébenes;Jesús Escudero-Sahuquillo;Pedro Javier García;Francisco J.

The hybrid MPPT method is a combination of conventional Perturb and Observe (P&O) and Fractional Short Circuit Current (FSCC) MPPT technique. The proposed hybrid MPPT decides intelligently about the initial operating point of P&O by using the FSCC MPPT method. This method requires no sensor for irradiation measurement because it detects intelligently about the change in irradiance. Therefore, under dynamic weather conditions the decision about measuring the initial operating point of P&O is intelligent. After finding the initial operating point the system shifts to the conventional P&O method and starts to perturb with a small perturbation size. The use of small perturbation steps enables the system to work with less power oscillations around the Maximum Power Point (MPP), while the use of FSCC helps in rapid tracking of MPP especially under the varying environmental conditions. Thus, the proposed method is fast in tracking the MPP with less power oscillations and hence better performance in terms of energy harvesting when compared with the conventional P&O technique. Impedance matching between solar panel and load is achieved using a DC-DC boost converter and the proposed method is simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The system is simulated against the steady and dynamic weather conditions. The results shows that under steady weather condition the proposed method harvests 5% extra energy as compared with the conventional P&O. For dynamic weather conditions the proposed method harness an additional 3.5% energy when compared with the P&O method, which makes it very promising.	boost converter;dc-to-dc converter;goodyear mpp;impedance matching;matlab;maximum power transfer theorem;operating point;perturbation theory;sensor;short circuit;simulink	Hadeed Ahmed Sher;Ali Faisal Murtaza;Khaled E.

Matrix nearness problems are formulated to assess the attractiveness of this alternative. Polynomial preconditioning leads to polynomial approximation problems involving lemniscate-like sets, both in the plane and in Cn×n. A natural matrix analytic extension for lemniscates is introduced. Operator theoretically one is concerned with polynomial unitarity and associated factorizations for the inverse. For the speed of convergence and lemniscate asymptotics, the notion of quasilemniscate arises. In the L2-norm algorithms for solving the problem are devised.	algorithm;approximation;linear least squares (mathematics);linear system;polynomial ring;precondition;preconditioner;rate of convergence;unitarity (physics)	Marko Huhtanen;Olavi Nevanlinna	2016	Numerische Mathematik	10.1007/s00211-015-0745-2	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;iteration;potential theory;length;approximation;mathematics;algebra	Theory	80.22255857447661	18.641641246077256	2566

Further, we extend the information combining problem by adding a constraint on the second moment of soft bits, and find the extremal distributions for this new problem. The results for this extension problem are used to improve the prediction of convergence of the belief propagation decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, provided that another extremal problem related to the variable nodes is solved.	belief propagation;low-density parity-check code;software propagation	Yibo Jiang;Alexei E.

To implement handling logic correctly, thorough testing is necessary. However, the cost of providing such diverse setups in real hardware is prohibitively high, resulting in a lack of testing. In this article, we present a Virtual Test Environment (VTE) that considerably lowers this barrier by providing complex network environments on a single computer and thus enables testing in situations where it otherwise would not be feasible.	complex network	Wolfgang Schnerring;Christian Kauhaus;Dietmar Fey	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-75416-9_16	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;network simulation;distributed computing	HPC	-1.7359092336618493	66.09432445236091	2569

20f7c799f7cb9d220150d711c6cec2c2882645cc	constructing words with high distinct square densities		Fraenkel and Simpson showed that the number of distinct squares in a word of length n is bounded from above by 2n, since at most two distinct squares have their rightmost, or last, occurrence begin at each position. Improvements by Ilie to 2n−Θ(logn) and by Deza et al. to ⌊11n/6⌋ rely on the study of combinatorics of FS-double-squares, when the maximum number of two last occurrences of squares begin. In this paper, we first study how to maximize runs of FS-double-squares in the prefix of a word. We show that for a given positive integer m, the minimum length of a word beginning with m FS-double-squares, whose lengths are equal, is 7m+ 3. We construct such a word and analyze its distinct-square-sequence as well as its distinct-square-density. We then generalize our construction. We also construct words with high distinct-square-densities that approach 5/6.	simpson's rule	Francine Blanchet-Sadri;S.

However, reliable operation of such devices must be ensured by using adequate test methods. We propose a signature analysis technique to efficiently test power-gating structures that provide intermediate power-off modes. In particular, the proposed technique can be used to test and diagnose an efficient multi-mode power-gating architecture that was proposed recently. In addition, we propose a methodology to repair catastrophic and parametric faults, and to tolerate process variations. Analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	network switch;power gating;shutdown (computing);simulation;spectral leakage;turing test	Zhaobo Zhang;Xrysovalantis Kavousianos;Yan Luo;Yiorgos Tsiatouhas;Krishnendu Chakrabarty	2011	2011 Sixteenth IEEE European Test Symposium	10.1109/ETS.2011.18	chip;maintenance engineering;control engineering;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;signal processing;software testing;test method;upper and lower bounds;particle detector;process variation;transistor;statistics	EDA	20.82760943747153	54.65370206986139	2581

In the new defined transform domain, the channel parameters of the two block pilots in the SC-FDMA subframe are first estimated, then the polynomial basis expansion model (P-BEM) is employed to estimate the channel parameters of the data symbols, and an autoregressive (AR) model is used to improve the estimation accuracy of the channel parameters of the data symbols out of the two block pilots. The symbol-by-symbol changes of the channel parameters can be effectively estimated by the proposed method. Simulation results show that the proposed method is robust to the fast time-varying channel in the HST scenario, and that the frame error rate (FER) performance of the system by using the proposed method can obtain a gain in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of more than 10 dB compared with those of the available methods.	autoregressive model;boundary element method;carrier frequency;channel state information;compaq lte;duplex (telecommunications);polynomial basis;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link;test-driven development	Lihua Yang;Guangliang Ren;Bingke Yang;Zhiliang Qiu	2012	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2012.2214409	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;mathematics;frequency-division multiplexing;time division multiple access;polynomial	Mobile	48.8635024321366	79.14496011457845	2583

A summary of previous applications of fuzzy logic to telecommunications is given outlining also potential applications of fuzzy logic in future cognitive radio systems. In complex and dynamic operational environments, future cognitive radio systems will need sophisticated decision making and environment awareness techniques that are capable of handling multidimensional, conflicting and usually non-predictable decision making problems where optimal solutions can not be necessarily found.

Corresponding to each permutation  P  of  G , a product  λPμ  of fuzzy subsets of  G  is defined. The sup-min product turns out to be the pathological case when  P  is the identity mapping of  G . The cardinality of the distinct products  λPμ  equals the cardinality of the cosets of the group of all automorphisms of  G  in the group of its permutations. The vicious circle formed by the problem of determining either of these cardinalities is broken by the fact that the class of binary compositions on  G  which keep  G  isomorphically invariant possesses exactly this very cardinality.	fuzzy set	Suryansu Ray	1993	Inf.

The buffer sizing regimes we focus on are the widely deployed bandwidth-delay rule and a small buffer regime. The performance metrics we consider are stability of the queue size, queuing delay, link utilisation and packet loss. We analyse the following models: (i) a non-linear model for C-TCP with Drop-Tail and small buffers, (ii) a stochastic variant of REM along with C-TCP, and (iii) the original REM proposal as a continuous time non-linear model with delayed feedback. We develop conditions to ensure local stability and show that variations in system parameters can induce a Hopf bifurcation, leading to the emergence of limit cycles. With Drop-Tail, and small buffers, the Compound parameters and the buffer size play a key role in maintaining stability. With the stochastic variant of REM, larger thresholds for marking/dropping packets can destabilise the system. With REM, an increase in the feedback delay, or variations in the queue management parameters, can induce a Hopf bifurcation. Design guidelines for Compound parameters, based on analysis, to ensure stability are provided. Packet-level simulations corroborate some of the analysis.	active queue management;bifurcation theory;emergence;hopf bifurcation;item unique identification;limit cycle;linear model;microsoft windows;network packet;nonlinear system;operating system;profiling (computer programming);queuing delay;simulation	Haseen Rahman;Krishnamurthy Giridhar;Gaurav Raina	2013	2013 11th International Symposium and Workshops on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)		stochastic process;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;active queue management;transport layer;computer network	Metrics	-2.396438473107651	95.01369420606277	2625

Cross-layer optimizations integrating the use of adaptive sleep, adaptive modulation and energy-aware higher layer processing and protocols are assumed. Routing and application layer processing are assumed to be dependent on lowerlayer protocols, requirements, and constraints. Applications relevant to this study are forest monitoring, where the probability of network failure is the main parameter to be minimized, and endangeredspecies monitoring, where the probability of node failure is reduced by increasing the expected node life. Results are shown comparing expected node life of a cross-layered design to that of a traditional adaptive modulation system.	adaptive filter;adaptive grammar;modulation;performance prediction;requirement;routing;sleep mode	Elyes Bdira;Mohamed Ibnkahla	2009	GLOBECOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425812	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;adaptive system;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	11.995956624033298	81.95361898180096	2627

We propose a taxonomy of the major trends in environmental surveillance according to the characteristics of the sensing devices, i.e., (i) for a unique sensor or an array of sensors (e.g., bio-sensor, chemical sensor arrays), (ii) for remote observation, and (iii) using large-scale sensor networks.	british informatics olympiad;high-level programming language;image sensor;machine learning;multimodal interaction;oracle fusion architecture;sensor;signal processing	Matthieu Puigt;Gilles Delmaire;Gilles Roussel	2017			computer science;data mining	Mobile	4.062253688360395	32.46741709123451	2644

One of the primary barriers contributing to this is a lack of understanding about how readers will impact the battery life of a mobile smartphone. In this work we describe our experimental investigation into the energy consumption impact of compact UHF Class-1 Generation-2 RFID readers as compared with existing sensors that are common in smartphones. Our evaluation shows that the energy consumption of compact RFID readers is affected by environmental conditions and network parameters that influence reader-tag link quality and that reader energy consumption is comparable to existing integrated Bluetooth, GPS and WiFi interfaces on smartphones. Existing experimental work on UHF readers (e.g., [1]) has focused mainly on tag read performance while our goal is to characterize how various factors impact the energy consumption of compact readers relative to existing smartphone sensors.	bluetooth;e-commerce;global positioning system;inventory control;mobile phone;radio-frequency identification;sensor;smartphone;ubiquitous computing;ultra high frequency	Marinos Argyrou;Matt Calder;Arsham Farshad;Mahesh K.

The nodes communicate with each other by wireless radio links with no human intervention. Each mobile node functions as a specialized router to forward information to other mobile nodes. In order to provide efficient end-to-end communication with the network of nodes, a routing protocol is used to discover the optimal routes between the nodes. The routing protocols meant for wired networks can not be used for MANETs because of the mobility of nodes. Routing in ad hoc networks is nontrivial due to highly dynamic nature of the nodes. Various routing protocols have been proposed and widely evaluated for efficient routing of packets. This research paper presents an overview on classification of wide range of routing protocols for mobile ad hoc wireless networks proposed in the literature and shows the performance evaluation of the routing protocols: DSDV, AODV, FSR, LAR, OLSR, STAR and ZRP using the network simulator QualNet 4.0 to determine which protocols may perform best in large networks. To judge the merit of a routing protocol, one needs performance metrics (throughput, end-to-end delay, jitter, packet delivery ratio, routing overhead) with which to measure its suitability and performance. Our simulation experiments show that the LAR protocol achieves relatively good performance compared to other routing protocols.	autonomous robot;end-to-end principle;experiment;hoc (programming language);liquidity at risk;network packet;optimized link state routing protocol;organizing (structure);overhead (computing);performance evaluation;router (computing);self-organization;simulation;throughput	Kuncha Sahadevaiah;Oruganti Bala Venkata Ramanaiah	2010	IJCNS	10.4236/ijcns.2010.36069	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;geocast;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	1.9044562713998991	84.97093357779053	2655

We consider the computation of a quickest path from a source node to a destination node for a given message size in a network with n nodes and m links each of which is speci6ed by bandwidth and delay. Every known quickest path algorithm computes m shortest paths either directly or indirectly, and this step contributes to most of its computational complexity which is generally of the form O(m +mn log n). We present a probabilistic quickest path algorithm that computes an approximate quickest path with time complexity O(pm + pn log n) by randomly selecting p6m bandwidths at which the shortest paths are computed. We show that the delay of the computed path is close to optimal with a high probability that approaches 1 exponentially fast with respect to p=m. Simulation results indicate that this algorithm computes the optimal quickest paths with p=m¡ 0:1 for almost all randomly generated networks with n¿ 40. We also present an algorithm to compute the path-table consisting of these approximate quickest paths with the same time complexity of O(pm+ pn log n). c © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Aiming at the just-acceptable error rate (JAER), the detection methods are switched according to the channel condition. In this letter, we formulate the switching of detection methods as a multiple-choice knapsack problem (MCKP). Then, based on the linear relaxation MCKP, the lower and upper bounds of the potential complexity saving of CA-MIMO are derived, where the former comes from our proposed switching strategy. The simulations show that the lower and upper bounds are tightly matched, demonstrating our two contributions: the evaluation of the optimal performance of the CA-MIMO detection without solving the NP-hard MCKP, and the design of an efficient and practical switching strategy.	knapsack problem;linear programming relaxation;mimo;maximal set;np-hardness;simulation	I-Wei Lai;Chia-han Lee;Gerd Ascheid;Tzi-Dar Chiueh	2012	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/WCL.2012.091312.120513	mathematical optimization;detector;bit error rate;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;computational complexity theory;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics;mimo	Embedded	33.812615848196344	91.22562285460035	2671

Such problems are characterized by a constraint matrix that has in every column blocks of consecutive ones, each corresponding to a shift. We focus on three type of shift scheduling problems classified according to the column structure in the constraint matrix: consecutive ones columns, cyclical ones columns and k consecutive blocks columns. In particular the complexity of the cyclical scheduling problem, where the matrix satisfies the cyclical 1’s property in each column was noted recently by Hochbaum and Tucker to be open. They further showed that the unit demand case is polynomially solvable. Here we extend this result to the uniform requirements case, and provide a 2-approximation algorithm for the non-uniform case. We also establish that the cyclical scheduling problem’s complexity is equivalent to that of the exact matching problem – a problem the complexity status of which is known to be randomized polynomial, RP. We then investigate the three types of shift scheduling problems and show that while the consecutive ones version is polynomial and the k-block columns is NP-hard (for k ≥ 2), For thek-blocks problem we give a simple k-approximation algorithm, which is the first approximation algorithm determined for the problem.	approximation algorithm;column (database);covering problems;decision problem;np-hardness;nurse scheduling problem;order of approximation;polynomial hierarchy;rp (complexity);randomized algorithm;requirement;scheduling (computing);the matrix;tucker decomposition	Dorit S.

It is shown that the decoder may be implemented efficiently using a Viterbi algorithm which operates on a time-varying trellis with a number of states which is exponential in the product of the number of users in the system and the constraint length of the codes used (for the rate 1/2 code case). The asymptotic efficiency of this receiver relative to an uncoded coherent binary phase shift keying (BPSK) receiver (termed asymptotic multiuser coding gain, or AMCG) is then upper and lower bounded. The AMCG parameter unifies the asymptotic coding gain parameter and the asymptotic multiuser efficiency parameter which are traditional figure of merit parameters for single-user coded systems and multiuser uncoded systems, respectively. Finally, some simulations are presented to illustrate the performance of the maximum likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE) at moderate and low bit error rates.	additive white gaussian noise;bit error rate;coding gain;coherence (physics);convolutional code;key (cryptography);maximum likelihood sequence estimation;modulation;multi-user;simulation;time complexity;trellis quantization;utility functions on indivisible goods;viterbi algorithm	Thomas R.

This problem has an important application in software maintenance, where it is often required to find equivalency between two sections of codes. Two sections of codes are said to be equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by renaming only identifiers and variables. In this paper, we propose two new algorithms for the said problem by using the q-gram approach. The first one is obtained by using this approach on an existing string matching algorithm (simplified backward non-deterministic directed acyclic word graph matching (SBNDM)).The second one is obtained by using the q-gram approach on the parameterized string matching algorithm (parameterized backward non-deterministic directed acyclic word graph matching (PBNDM)). Performance of both the algorithms is tested for various values of q and it has been observed that both show their best performance for q nearly equal to half of the pattern length. We also study the effect on running time of these algorithms with increasing the duplicity in the text.	code;directed acyclic graph;identifier;n-gram;pattern matching;software maintenance;string searching algorithm;time complexity	Rajesh Prasad;Suneeta Agarwal	2010	ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes	10.1145/1764810.1764829	approximate string matching;commentz-walter algorithm;computer science;3-dimensional matching;theoretical computer science;finite-state machine;software maintenance;directed acyclic word graph;string searching algorithm	SE	13.332510464729422	26.741528297848234	2691

The ideal notch filter has a 3-dB notch bandwidth (BW) equal to zero in the notch band and the unity gain in the passband. Therefore, the design objective is to shrink the BW as small as possible while preserving the gain as close to one as possible. The task of a notch filter is to eliminate interference while preserving the target broadband signal. These filters have many applications for narrowband interference removal in biomedical engineering [1], speech processing [2], image processing [3], [4], and communication [5]. In this article, we describe two ways to implement a notch filter. First, we present a simple notch filter and then illustrate why its performance is less than ideal. Next, we present a trick to apply a novel feedback structure to that notch filter, which improves its performance to nearly ideal. With the help of the feedback structure, we obtain an adjustable parameter. By tuning this parameter, different characteristics of the notch filter are obtained due to the change of its poles' position.	bandwidth (signal processing);distortion;feedback;image processing;interference (communication);speech processing	Soo-Chang Pei;Bo-Yi Guo;Wen-Yang Lu	2016	IEEE Signal Processing Magazine	10.1109/MSP.2016.2531578	telecommunications;control theory;thd analyzer	ML	60.44953732791195	17.90933587433034	2701
5631a83533c3d13f1c77b619e69baaba10d657f3	supporting adaptive privatization techniques for irregular array reductions in task-parallel programming models		Irregular array-type reductions represent a reoccurring algorithmic pattern in many scientific applications. Their scalable execution on modern systems is not trivial as their irregular memory access pattern prohibits an efficient use of the memory subsystem and costly techniques are needed to eliminate data races. Taking a closer look at algorithms, memory access patterns and support techniques reveals that a one-size-fits-all solution does not exist and approaches are needed that can adapt to individual properties while maintaining programming transparency. In this work we propose a solution framework that generalizes the concept of privatization to support a variety of techniques, implements an inspector-executor to provide memory access analytics to the runtime for automatic tuning and shows what language extensions are needed. A reference implementation in OmpSs, a task-parallel programming model, shows programmability and scalability of this solution.	parallel computing	Jan Ciesko;Sergi Mateo;Xavier Teruel;Xavier Martorell;Eduard Ayguadé;Jesús Labarta	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-45550-1_24	simulation;management science	HPC	-4.155395795264461	49.64408867171626	2719

We propose a beacon-free MAC layer, based on a collaborative version of the preamble sampling approach. This is designed to address the regulatory LDC constraints, which UWB devices must comply to. Simulations are presented to show that this protocol looks quite interesting and future work is introduced.	access control;computer simulation;l band;linguistic data consortium;network packet;relay;sampling (signal processing);ultra-wideband;wake-on-lan	Benoit Miscopein;Jean Schwoerer;Jean-Marie Gorce	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5450187	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;body area network;physical layer;computer network	Mobile	12.81901927859494	81.61112493322811	2726

Using these properties, a 2-D signal can be processed by some 1-D approaches to reduce the computational complexity. However, the non-orthogonal structure of DPRT projections introduces redundant operations that often lower the e8ciency of the technique in applications. In this paper, we propose the orthogonal discrete periodic Radon transform (ODPRT) in which a new decomposition approach is introduced. All ODPRT projections are modi;ed to be orthogonal such that redundancy is eliminated. Furthermore, we consider the e8cient realization for computing ODPRT and its inverse that make the proposed ODPRT more feasible in practical applications. ? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Compared with the existing CB/SB routing architecture and CS-box architecture, the proposed GSB architecture has much larger exploration space. Experimental results with MCNC benchmark circuits show that the performance of FPGAs with GSB is about 24.3% better than the CB/SB architecture with the same segment distribution in terms of product of channel width and delay using 0.17% less routing switches for the single wire length. For the two types of wire segments, we propose an architecture with 13.3% performance improvement at the cost of about 0.8% increase in switch number compared to the single wire length GSB architecture.	benchmark (computing);box modeling;field-programmable gate array;kvm switch;mathematical optimization;network switch;routing;sandy bridge	Kejie Ma;Lingli Wang;Xuegong Zhou;Sheldon X.-D.

The result of filtering is a set of sequences over GF(2 m) called exponent sequences. Each exponent sequence can be regarded as m parallel component sequences. Assessment of the parallel generator is discussed and statistical properties of individual component sequences and their mutual statistical dependence are examined. Upper bounds on the linear equivalence of exponent sequences and their associated component sequences are developed and it is shown that in both cases higher linear complexity can only be achieved in higher exponents. It is noticed that exponents that are prime to 2 m-1 produce sequences of maximum period and their component sequences have small cross correlation (equal to -1) and low statistical dependence. Finally directions for further research are proposed.	emoticon;x window system;x10	Reihaneh Safavi-Naini	1990		10.1007/BFb0030360	nonlinear filter;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;random sequence;cross-correlation;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;statistics	Crypto	41.984265512000086	47.66505576721247	2742

In this paper, cluster formation for downlink transmissions in C-RANs is studied. In particular, with a fixed intro-cluster cooperation strategy, an explicit expression for the successful access probability is derived by applying stochastic geometry. By using the obtained theoretical result as a utility function, the problem of grouping remote radio heads is formulated as a coalitional formation game, and then two distributed algorithms based on the merge and split approach are obtained as efficient solutions for the cases with and without cluster size constraints, respectively. Compared with grand cluster formation, which is a centralized method, simulation results show that the proposed approaches can achieve better performance with smaller cluster settings.	access network;centralized computing;channel state information;computer cluster;distributed algorithm;interference (communication);profiling (computer programming);simulation;telecommunications link;utility	Zhongyuan Zhao;Mugen Peng;Zhiguo Ding;Chonggang Wang;H.

The circuit can be used as a component of different self-organizing neural networks (NN) implemented in the CMOS technology. In Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) as well as in NNs using the Neural Gas or the Winner Takes All (WTA) learning algorithms, to calculate the distance between X and W , the same circuit can be used that makes it a universal structure. Detailed system level simulations of the WTA NN and the Kohonen SOM showed that using both the Euclidean (L2) and the Manhattan (L1) distance measures leads to similar learning results. For this reason, the L1 measure has been implemented, as in this case the circuit is much simpler than the one using the L2 distance, resulting in very low chip area and low power dissipation. This enables including even large NNs in miniaturized portable devices, such as sensors in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) or Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN).	algorithm;analog signal;artificial neural network;cmos;machine learning;neural gas;neuron;organizing (structure);personal digital assistant;self-organization;sensor;simulation;taxicab geometry;teuvo kohonen;weapon target assignment problem	Rafal Dlugosz;Tomasz Talaska;Witold Pedrycz;Pierre-André Farine	2012			computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	ML	5.488338761335002	41.548793344134495	2753

A novel dynamic state-space model (DSSM) is constructed for BLAST systems that is crucial for development of particle filtering algorithms. The proposed DSSM is based on QR decomposition and the output of the feedforward filter, and it evolves in space. The particle filtering solution does not suffer from error propagation, and our simulations show that it greatly outperforms the V-BLAST and provides near optimum performance.	algorithm;blast;cs-blast;feedforward neural network;particle filter;propagation of uncertainty;qr decomposition;simulation;software propagation;state space	Yufei Huang;Jianqiu Zhang;Petar M.

To realize this ability, we proposed MPTCP selective bicasting which bicasts only retransmission request packets and retransmission packets. However, this method as a problem that it would not improve throughput so much when the condition of wireless communication deteriorates since it bicasts packets only after the transport layer detects packet losses. In this paper, we propose a method to improve throughput which bicasts packets before the transport layer detects packet losses by means of cross-layer control. Based on the frame loss rate in the data link layer, this method sends dropping packets via the alternative interface earlier than the previous method. Simulation results shows that the proposed method improves throughput without sending so many packets via the alternative interface.	internet protocol suite;mobile device;network packet;retransmission (data networks);simulation;throughput	Masami Fukuyama;Nariyoshi Yamai;Satoshi Ohzahata;Naoya Kitagawa	2018	2018 IEEE 42nd Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	10.1109/COMPSAC.2018.10230	throughput;data link layer;wireless network;real-time computing;wireless;multipath tcp;network packet;transport layer;retransmission;computer science	Mobile	-3.0376176999955464	91.4240470591944	2768

This situation is relevant for MIMO systems with large antenna arrays (large-MIMO systems). Our result settles a conjecture by Zheng & Tse (2002) in the affirmative. The capacity-achieving input signal, which we refer to as Beta-variate space-time modulation (BSTM), turns out to be the product of a unitary isotropically distributed random matrix, and a diagonal matrix whose nonzero entries are distributed as the square-root of the eigenvalues of a Beta-distributed random matrix of appropriate size. Numerical results illustrate that using BSTM instead of USTM in large-MIMO systems yields a rate gain as large as 13% for SNR values of practical interest.	mimo;modulation;numerical linear algebra;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-noise ratio;torque game engine	Wei Yang;Giuseppe Durisi;Erwin Riegler	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283571	combinatorics;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;modulation	Theory	38.29071248759622	74.42044130953174	2775

A core idea of the methods is to decompose the original equation into linear and nonlinear subequations, in which the linear subequation has a closed-form solution in the Fourier space. We apply a nonlinear Newton-type iterative method to solve the nonlinear subequation at the implicit time level and thus a considerably large time step can be used. By combining these subequations, we achieve the first- and second-order accuracy in time. We present numerical experiments to show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods.	iteration;iterative method;list of operator splitting topics;newton;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;operating system;powerbuilder foundation classes;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Hyun Geun Lee;Jaemin Shin;June-Yub Lee	2015	J.

A prime example of such an application would be low-cost and real-time video surveillance of hallways or video conferencing. Traditional solutions for these scenarios use state-of-the-art video codecs like H.264/AVC in order to achieve the low bitrate which is essential in wireless communication. On the flip side, such encoders are computationally complex and need expensive hardware to run on thus making them inefficient choices for being deployed in clusters. Recent research has resulted in distributed video coding (DVC) being proposed as a solution for applications that have limited battery resources and low hardware complexity, thus necessitating a low-complexity encoder. It is now a popular topic in the research community and the past years have seen several implementations. However, current DVC solutions use iteratively decodable channel codes like low-density parity check – accumulate (LDPCA) codes or Turbo codes that have large latencies. In order to make real-time communication possible, the proposed architecture makes efficient use of skip blocks to reduce the bitrate, eliminates the iterative decoding nature of the Wyner-Ziv (WZ) channel and uses a simple data-hidingbased compression algorithm. This drastically cuts down on the time complexity of the decoding procedure while still maintaining a rate–distortion performance better than that of H.264/AVC intra-coding and other current DVC solutions.	algorithm;closed-circuit television;codec;data compression;distortion;encoder;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;iterative method;lz77 and lz78;parity bit;real-time clock;real-time transcription;time complexity;turbo code;winzip	Krishna Rao Vijayanagar;Joohee Kim	2011	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2010.0929	turbo code;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;videoconferencing	Mobile	11.332322405965716	69.57565620553287	2791
654496d33a9c7b02aae8d6de4f50dae153c9cacb	minimization of the storage and the transportation costs in an elementary supply chain with the multiple transporter case		This paper is aimed at studying the batch production and delivery integrated scheduling in a single supply chain with identical jobs. These jobs are delivered by a fleet of heterogeneous transporters, with the time and cost parameters dependent on the batch size. We assume that there is no time lag between the execution time of the production batch and that of the onset of the loading batch. Each job has to be delivered before a given due date. The product may arrive before his due date, thus incurring a holding cost for those concerned in some cases. Hence, the problem becomes finding a coordinated production and delivery schedule in which the sum of the delivery and holding cost is minimized. A mathematical formulation of the problem is given as a non-linear model in a general way and provides a dominante properties. We propose a general dynamic programming scheme, which can solve small to middle size instances of the problem. The evaluation of the efficiency of this method is measured by the comparison with a genetic algorithm.	approximation algorithm;dynamic programming;entity–relationship model;experiment;genetic algorithm;job stream;linear model;nonlinear system;onset (audio);performance;run time (program lifecycle phase);scheduling (computing);software release life cycle;objectif	Zakaria Hammoudan;Olivier Grunder;Abdellah El Moudni	2013		10.3182/20130619-3-RU-3018.00529	real-time computing;simulation;engineering;operations management	AI	14.460853644805903	6.875819919569253	2792

This constraint ensures that, among a set of variables X1, . . . , Xn, the difference between two variables is at least p. This restriction models, in particular, scheduling problems in which tasks require p contiguous units of a resource to be completed. Until now, the best known propagator for bound consistency had time complexity O(n). In this work we propose a quadratic propagator for the same level of consistency. We then show that this theoretical gain gives savings of an order of magnitude in our benchmark of scheduling problems.	benchmark (computing);local consistency;mathematical optimization;propagator;scheduling (computing);time complexity	Claude-Guy Quimper;Alejandro López-Ortiz;Gilles Pesant	2006			time complexity;mathematical optimization;computer science;local consistency	AI	18.531761071305908	9.958349181957068	2798

Since the users at the inner region are less exposed to inter-cell interference, the frequency resources in each inner region can be universally used. Based on this frequency band allocation, FFR may reduce channel interference and offer large system capacity. This paper proposes a mechanism that selects the optimal FFR scheme based on the user throughput and user satisfaction. In detail, the mechanism selects the optimal size of the inner and outer region for each cell as well as the optimal frequency allocation between these regions that either maximizes the mean user throughput or the user satisfaction. The mechanism is evaluated through several simulation scenarios.	allan variance;channel capacity;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;frequency allocation;frequency band;interference (communication);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;throughput	Dimitrios Bilios;Christos Bouras;Vasileios Kokkinos;Andreas Papazois;Georgia Tseliou	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214087	spectrum management;throughput;adjacent-channel interference;frequency allocation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;interference;bandwidth;computer network	HPC	28.567957216355605	90.18851898390152	2799

First we show that the common Gaussian kernel can only be generalized to a positive definite kernel on a geodesic metric space if the space is flat. As a result, for data on a Riemannian manifold, the geodesic Gaussian kernel is only positive definite if the Riemannian manifold is Euclidean. This implies that any attempt to design geodesic Gaussian kernels on curved Riemannian manifolds is futile. However, we show that for spaces with conditionally negative definite distances the geodesic Laplacian kernel can be generalized while retaining positive definiteness. This implies that geodesic Laplacian kernels can be generalized to some curved spaces, including spheres and hyperbolic spaces.

These semidiscrete systems amount to large systems of ODEs with the possibility that the matrices involved are far from being normal. The stability question of their Runge-Kutta methods, therefore, cannot be addressed by the familiar scalar arguments of eigenvalues lying in the corresponding region of absolute stability. Instead, we replace this scalar spectral analysis by the energy method, where stability of the fully discrete Runge-Kutta methods takes into account the full eigenstructure of the problem at hand. We discuss two energy method approaches that guarantee the stability of fullydiscrete Runge-Kutta methods for sufficiently small CFL condition, ∆t ≤ ∆t0. In the first approach, Runge-Kutta methods are shown to preserve stability for the subclass of coercive semidiscrete problems. A second approach treats the more general class of semibounded problems. It is shown that their time integration by third-order Runge-Kutta method is stable under a slightly more restrictive CFL condition. We conclude by utilizing these two approaches to examine the stability of Runge-Kutta discretizations of semidiscrete advection-diffusion problems. Our study includes a detailed stability analysis for prototype examples of one-sided and centered finite differencing and pseudospectral Fourier and Jacobi-based methods.

6fce1d1ffeb2cdbdf62066e3462e7699cebe09f6	trs-80 with a grain of salt		This paper presents early results of a (very) experimental implementation of the elliptic curve and stream cipher calculations of the Networking and Cryptography library (NaCl), on the TRS-80 Model I. Needless to say, the demonstration that such a library, which has been optimized for many modern platforms including leading edge desktops, servers and, recently, modern microcontrollers, is even feasible on such early home microcomputers is, at best, to be considered a recreation rather than as a practical application of technology. In the process, however, lessons were learned in implementing trade-o s for basic cryptographic primitives and, more importantly maybe, in experimenting with some transformative aspects of retrocomputing.	cryptographic primitive;elliptic curve cryptography;experiment;microcomputer;microcontroller;salt (cryptography);stream cipher	Jean-Marie Chauvet	2013	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		leading edge;elliptic curve;microcontroller;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;server;stream cipher;computer science;distributed computing	Security	8.852517347728242	64.6857522852518	2812

In this work we describe a particular scalable architecture of this kind using both standard processor and FPGA processing components. It supports multiple FPGA applications through standard FPGA functions implementing the net-working support, and also provides standard CPU functions on the FPGA for the sequential control of application circuits and for their interfacing to the network. On standard von-Neumann machines, a set of such standard functions implemented with the resources of the machine but not directly available from it, and providing a higher level runtime environment for applications would be called an operating system. After defining the scalable architecture and the runtime support, system design and programming (in particular, of FPGA networks) can be automated. We demonstrate this through a simple algorithm to determine the required mix of components for a given application. The architecture is further supported by a system-level, compiled coordination language for functions compiled with the standard processor and FPGA tools	algorithm;central processing unit;compiler;embedded system;field-programmable gate array;operating system;requirement;runtime system;scalability;systems design;von neumann architecture	Friedrich Mayer-Lindenberg	2006	9th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design (DSD'06)	10.1109/DSD.2006.39	embedded system;computer architecture;logic synthesis;computer science;network interface;operating system;system programming;fpga prototype;field-programmable gate array	EDA	3.1588561569986693	49.439029307340206	2814

We consider n wireless mobile sensors with identical sensing range r initially randomly deployed on the [ 0 , ∞ ) according to the arrival times of the Poisson process with arrival rate λ u003e 0 . The cost of individual sensor movement is proportional to the displacement to some power a ≥ 1 . In this paper we discover and explain a threshold around the interference distance s = 1 λ and the sensing radius r = 1 2 λ for the maximum displacement to the power a to ensure coverage and to avoid interference.

The proposed SPST separates the target designs into two parts, i.e., the most significant part and least significant part (MSP and LSP), and turns off the MSP when it does not affect the computation results to save power. Furthermore, this paper proposes an original glitch-diminishing technique to filter out useless switching power by asserting the data signals after the data transient period. This paper adopts two multimedia/DSP design examples, i.e., a multitransform design for H.264 and a versatile multimedia functional unit (VMFU), to evaluate the proposed SPST. These two design examples have quite different hardware configurations, thus, the realization issues of the SPST on every design also remarkably differ from each other. The multitransform design can compute three transforms which are required in H.264 encoding while the VMFU possesses six commonly used multimedia/DSP functions, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication, MAC, interpolation, and sum-of-absolute-difference. After optimizing the design elaborately, we find that the proposed SPST can, respectively, save 27% and 24% power dissipation on average of the H.264 multitransform design and the VMFU at the expense of less than 20% area augmentation.	cmos;cpu power dissipation;combinational logic;computation;execution unit;glitch;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;integrated circuit;interpolation;low-power broadcasting;max;spectral leakage;switch;very-large-scale integration;zero suppression	Kuan-Hung Chen;Yuan-Sun Chu	2009	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2008.926582	electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer hardware;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;very-large-scale integration	EDA	12.781846628596309	42.31029941590253	2830

In doing so, we also show that the well known Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be optimized in a similar manner to achieve a sub-cubic time bound for the All Pairs Shortest Paths problem without having to resort to recursion in the semi-ring theory.	cubic function;minimum weight;polygon triangulation	Sung Eun Bae;Tong-Wook Shinn;Tadao Takaoka	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-48749-6_24	mathematical optimization;minimum-weight triangulation;combinatorics;delaunay triangulation;rectilinear polygon;pitteway triangulation;star-shaped polygon;point set triangulation;geometry;monotone polygon;polygon covering;polygon triangulation;pick's theorem	Theory	30.093022474893562	18.980392300599355	2832

Mathematically, a profile is a member of the quotient space C(M)/K, where C(M) denotes the space of continuous functions defined on a compact subset M ⊂ R, and K is the subspace of constant functions. In this paper we investigate the minimax approximation of a given profile [f ] ∈ C(M)/K by elements of a closed convex cone in C(M)/K. We establish the existence of a minimax approximation (uniqueness does not in general hold) and prove two characterization theorems for any such best approximation. One of these theorems is then used as a basis for a “bisection” algorithm to compute a best approximation corresponding to a particular type of finishing process known as recursive operator controlled finishing.	algorithm;approximation;bisection method;convex cone;minimax;recursion;scott continuity	Charles Allan Hall;T.

We have implemented an efficient parallel system, called the KAIST Image Computing System (KICS) for a multimedia platform and an image processing system. The main architecture of the KICS is a message passing model with hierarchically segmented buses. There are tow parallel clusters in which two PE's (processing elements) are pipelined and the master PE of each cluster can access common global memory at high speed. The applications of the KICS to the MPEG-2 encoder and the volume rendering are introduced. The implemented algorithms are functionally or spatially partitioned and assigned to each PE in consideration with the load balancing and the required data traffic between PE's. The performance analysis for the applications and the general image processing functions are performed. The programmability and the high- speed data-access capability of the KICS are its most important features as a high-performance system for real- time multimedia data processing.© (1997) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

The actual challenge is the load balance for tightly-coupled applications. In this paper, we focus on the important subclass of tightlycoupled applications, synchronous iterative applications and formally define their load balance problem. Two novel static meta heuristic algorithms are proposed for the load distribution: a genetic tabu hybrid search (GTHS) algorithm and a host clustering based iterative search (HCIS) algorithm, when different communication computation ratios are considered. To this end, the analysis and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of heuristic algorithms.	cluster analysis;computation;experiment;genetic algorithm;grid computing;hcs clustering algorithm;heterogeneous computing;heuristic (computer science);iteration;iterative method;load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;metaheuristic;performance;star network;tabu search	Weizhe Zhang;Mingzeng Hu;Hongli Zhang	2005	Sixth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Applications and Technologies (PDCAT'05)	10.1109/PDCAT.2005.162	heuristic;computational science;atmospheric model;application software;parallel computing;computer science;weight distribution;load balancing;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;cluster analysis;computational model;symmetric multiprocessor system	HPC	-1.4827440201199777	33.6756312913137	2861
590bb94a2772e04d7ffd96984c938c0c3e93aa58	energy conservation and lifetime optimization of wireless body sensor networks for 24x7 physiological parameters' monitoring		—We introduce and propose a new architecture tested solely for a prompt sensing and anytime-connected wireless body area network for the transmission of important physiological signals over cellular networks. Our work considers signals related to cardiac diagnostics for transmission and energy based evaluations in such a network. The physiological data from cardiac parameters is sensed and transmitted over a Wireless Body Area Sensor Network (WBAN) to a Coordinator and Sink Station (CSS). The CSS compresses the data received, processes it and sends it through GSM communication over the cellular network to a remote base station. The GSM receiving unit receives the data and directs it to a dedicated remote server for demodulation and decompression. We have discussed the methods used for the compression of data in this scheme and tried to keep the transmission error low. We propose a dedicated channel in upcoming generations of mobile communication technology for the transmission of vital physiological data. We have also tried to evaluate the network lifetime using common battery models. Our methodology would facilitate round-the-clock health monitoring for the subscribers of a cellular communication system by working in partnership with the underlying body sensor networks consuming low power.	anytime algorithm;cascading style sheets;data compression;electronic circuit;experiment;mobile phone;routing;server (computing);telecommunications network	Amitabh Mishra;Dharma P.

For stimulation, most EA systems use a pair of needles with long, thick wires connected to an external power supply to form a closed current loop. The thin (φ=2mm) needle may suffer from the inconvenient and unstable connection to the thick wire and if there are many needles, it is difficult to supply power to all needles [4]. Recently, a wirelessly-powered EA system was proposed in [4] to remove the wire connections for convenient treatment, but its wireless power harvesting generated only 8μW which is not enough for various applications [1-3]. Most EA systems use bi-phase stimulation to reduce tissue damage, electrolysis, and electrolytic degradation [5]. However, the high-precision balancing of a bi-phase current pulse is difficult to achieve because the required offset, <;10nA [6], is only on the order of 10<;sup>;-5<;/sup>; of the stimulation current level, ~1mA. Furthermore, none of the previous EA systems have any feedback mechanism to enable adaptive stimulation by showing the real-time status of the EA stimulation to the patient.	ac adapter;control theory;current loop;electroconvulsive therapy;elegant degradation;feedback;functional electrical stimulation;multimodal interaction;power supply;real-time transcription	Kiseok Song;Hyungwoo Lee;Sunjoo Hong;Hyunwoo Cho;Hoi-Jun Yoo	2012	2012 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference	10.1109/ISSCC.2012.6177021	control engineering;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;integrated circuit	EDA	56.56572516480652	46.522401314264954	2866

This notion is motivated by applications in communication networks, distributed systems, and network design. This paper studies graph theoretic, algorithmic and complexity issues about tree spanners. It is shown that a tree 1-spanner, if it exists, in a weighted graph with m edges and n vertices is a minimum spanning tree and can be found in O(m log β(m, n)) time, where β(m, n) = min{i| log n ≤ m/n}. On the other hand, for any fixed t > 1, the problem of determining the existence of a tree t-spanner in a weighted graph is proven to be NP-complete. For unweighted graphs, it is shown that constructing a tree 2-spanner takes linear time, whereas determining the existence of a tree t-spanner is NP-complete for any fixed t ≥ 4. A theorem which captures the structure of tree 2-spanners is presented for unweighted graphs. For digraphs, an O((m+n)α(m, n)) algorithm is provided for finding a tree t-spanner with t as small as possible, where α(m, n) is a functional inverse of Ackerman’s function. The results for tree spanners on undirected graphs are extended to “quasitree spanners” on digraphs. Furthermore, linear time algorithms are derived for verifying tree spanners and quasitree spanners.	algorithm;directed graph;distributed computing;file spanning;geometric spanner;graph (discrete mathematics);graph theory;minimum spanning tree;np-completeness;network planning and design;telecommunications network;time complexity;verification and validation;vertex (geometry)	Leizhen Cai;Derek G.

Currently their design is an important challenge, one of the key issues being the integration of the pre-built components specific to different application domains (ex. electrical, mechanical, optical, etc.). In this context, new CAD tools offering the global view of the systems to be designed and enabling their overall validation are mandatory. This paper presents a generic discrete-continuous simulation model for an accurate global validation in component-based heterogeneous systems design. This model allows using powerful tools for the two domains; it was applied for simulation of systems integrating discrete models in SystemC and continuous models in Simulink.

A k-ary necklace is an Ž . equivalence class of k-ary strings under rotation the cyclic group . A k-ary unlabeled necklace is an equivalence class of k-ary strings under rotation and permutation of alphabet symbols. We present new, fast, simple, recursive algoŽ . rithms for generating i.e., listing all necklaces and binary unlabeled necklaces. These algorithms have optimal running times in the sense that their running times are proportional to the number of necklaces produced. The algorithm for generating necklaces can be used as the basis for efficiently generating many other equivalence classes of strings under rotation and has been applied to generating bracelets, fixed density necklaces, and chord diagrams. As another application, we describe the implementation of a fast algorithm for listing all degree n irreducible Ž . and primitive polynomials over GF 2 . 2000 Academic Press	algorithm;chord diagram;fast fourier transform;grammatical framework;irreducibility;irreducible polynomial;polynomial ring;recursion;turing completeness	Kevin Cattell;Frank Ruskey;Joe Sawada;Micaela Serra;C.

First, the constraints are represented by means of a full weak space-time formulation as a linear system in `2 in wavelet coordinates, following a recent approach by Schwab and Stevenson. Second, a quadratic cost functional involving a tracking-type term for the state and a regularization term for the distributed control is also formulated in terms of `2 sequence norms of wavelet coordinates. This functional serves as a representer for a functional involving different Sobolev norms with possibly non-integral smoothness parameter. Standard techniques from optimization are then used to derive the first order necessary conditions as a coupled system in `2-coordinates. For this purpose, an adaptive method is proposed which can be interpreted as an inexact gradient method for the control. In each iteration step, the primal and adjoint systems are solved up to a prescribed accuracy by the adaptive algorithm. It is shown that the adaptive algorithm converges. Moreover, the algorithm is proved to be asymptotically optimal: the convergence rate achieved for computing each of the components of the solution (state, adjoint state and control) up to a desired target tolerance is asymptotically the same as the wavelet best N -term approximation of each solution component, and the total computational work is proportional to the number of computational unknowns.	adaptive algorithm;approximation;asymptotically optimal algorithm;distributed control system;gradient method;iteration;linear system;mathematical optimization;numerical partial differential equations;optimal control;parabolic antenna;rate of convergence;wavelet	Max Gunzburger;Angela Kunoth	2011	SIAM J.

Our proof works by improving a probabilistic argument in that paper, which also improves a graph packing lemma proved there.  By a result of Gröger [G92] our complexity lower bound carries over from bipartite to general monotone n-vertex graph properties.

However, in networks with 802.11 wireless l inks we show that this is not the case. Our experiments show that the measured available bandwidth is ependent on the probe packet size (contrary to what is observed in wired n etworks). Another equally important finding is that the measured link capacity is dependent on the probe packet size andon the cross-traffic intensity. The study we present has been performed using a bandwidth mea surement tool, DietTopp, that is based on the previously not implemen ted TOPP method. DietTopp measures the end-to-end available bandwidth of a n etwork path along with the capacity of the congested link.	bandwidth (signal processing);case-based reasoning;end-to-end principle;experiment;high-level programming language;hoc (programming language);network packet;pareto efficiency;testbed;the openms proteomics pipeline	Andreas Johnsson;Bob Melander;Mats Björkman	2005		10.1007/0-387-31173-4_11	multi-frequency network;wireless wan;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Mobile	-1.342431774878666	87.52596328638248	2924
b735b73f5456a9721d7da0c1eb5e0a5eaef46969	analysis of sparse co-prime sensing array performance using wideband noise signals		A pair of co-prime receiving arrays with sparse inter-element spacing is capable of sampling a wide sense stationary signal at a set of points more densely relative to the element spacing. The properties of co-prime arrays make them attractive options for use in radar systems. In this paper, two-dimensional lattices are generated from a pair of co-prime matrices with array elements placed on these lattices. The transmission, reflection off of a target, and reception of signals by these arrays were simulated for both narrowband and wideband signals. Two waveform types were simulated. These include band-limited Gaussian noise, along with chirp waveforms so that the noise waveform performance could be assessed relative to a more traditional radar waveform. Several parameters were tested to measure the performance of the co-prime sensing arrays for the two signal types. First, the peak cross-correlation between the transmitted and received signals was studied over a range of signal bandwidths. Additionally, the quality of the arrays' estimation of the incidence direction of arrival (DOA) was determined. It was found that the band-limited noise waveforms demonstrated comparable performance to chirp signals with equivalent bandwidth. Additionally, it was found that multi-dimensional co-prime arrays were able to generate very accurate DOA estimations for both signal types.	bandlimiting;chirp;cross-correlation;direction of arrival;incidence matrix;radar;sampling (signal processing);simulation;sparse matrix;stationary process;waveform	David B.

The proposed approach exploits social relationships between user equipments (UEs) and their physical proximity to optimize the network throughput. We formulate the problem as a matching game between UEs and their serving nodes (SNs). In our proposed game, the serving node can be a small cell base station (SCBS) or an important node with device-to-device capabilities. In this game, the SCBSs and UEs maximize their respective utility functions capturing both the spatial and social structures of the network. We show that the proposed game belongs to the class of matching games with externalities. Subsequently, we propose a distributed algorithm using which the SCBSs and UEs interact and reach a stable matching. We show the convergence of the proposed algorithm and study the properties of the resulting matching. Simulation results show that the proposed socially-aware user association approach can efficiently offload traffic while yielding a significant gain reaching up to 63% in terms of data rates as compared to the classical (social-unaware) approach.	distributed algorithm;simulation;social network;social structure;stable marriage problem;throughput	Muhammad Ikram Ashraf;Mehdi Bennis;Walid Saad;Marcos D.

Mobile radio channels are both time and frequency dispersive, especially at high vehicular speeds, which makes channel estimation a challenging problem in system design. Conventional preamble-based and pilot-aided channel estimation require numerous reference signals, which significantly compromises the system throughput. This paper proposes a novel low complexity iterative turbo channel estimation technique which makes use of preamble, pilots and soft decoded data information in an iterative fashion to improve the system performance over the time and frequency selective fading channel while maintaining the system throughput. The numerical and analytical results show that the proposed technique can approach the performance of systems with perfect CSI with much fewer preamble and pilots symbols compared to existing channel estimation methods.	channel state information;code;coherent;computational complexity theory;dispersive partial differential equation;iteration;iterative method;numerical analysis;numerical method;signal-to-noise ratio;systems design;throughput	Ming Zhao;Zhenning Shi;Mark C.

We describe a model-based approach to building a system, TRSHOOT, that troubleshoots parity errors in a circuit. Given the appropriate structural and behavioral descriptions of a circuit and the symptoms of its failure, the system generates a list of plausible candidates responsible for the failure by applying suitable general principles. The candidate generation process comprises of three sub-processes: indictment, exoneration and extended exoneration. All these processes are discussed in some detail. A high level strategy is shown to provide useful guide to the troubleshooting process.	electronic circuit;error detection and correction;high-level programming language;interaction;parity bit	Choon P.

This work is motivated by the needs to implement FFT/IFFT in real-time on general microprocessors (e.g., Intel's ×86-based microprocessors) in signal processing and control applications, for example, in real-time implementation of frequency-domain iterative learning control techniques. The proposed TD-FFT technique explores the butterfly-structure in the FFT computation, and distributes the computation needed into a sequence of stages each executing a much shorter sampled data sequence. The proposed approach is extended to real-time IFFT computation as well. For a sampled sequence of 2N length, the proposed TD-FFT/TD-IFFT algorithm maintains the total computation complexity of FFT/IFFT while distributing the computation from one sampling period to multiple sampling periods. Then, the application of the proposed TD-FFT/TD-IFFT for real-time ILC implementation is presented, and demonstrated through an online implementation of the modeling free inversion-based iterative-learning control (MIIC) of a piezoelectric actuator in experiments.	algorithm;computation;experiment;fast fourier transform;iterative method;microprocessor;piezoelectricity;real-time clock;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;system camera	Jiangbo Liu;Bo Yan;Qingze Zou;Sicheng Yi	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7524942	coherent sampling;fast fourier transform;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;twiddle factor;harmonic wavelet transform;short-time fourier transform;split-radix fft algorithm;computer science;theoretical computer science;bruun's fft algorithm;discrete fourier transform;control theory;discrete fourier transform;rader's fft algorithm;prime-factor fft algorithm;frequency domain;iterative learning control;cyclotomic fast fourier transform	Robotics	59.894205152677365	22.05745333255579	2949
53f62c19a94a309bda3fe84ad5f42f2234e8c3ee	scheduling meets fixed-parameter tractability		Fixed-parameter tractability analysis and scheduling are two core domains of combinatorial optimization which led to deep understanding of many important algorithmic questions. However, even though fixed-parameter algorithms are appealing for many reasons, no such algorithms are known for many fundamental scheduling problems. In this paper we present the first fixed-parameter algorithms for classical scheduling problems such as makespan minimization, scheduling with job-dependent cost functions—one important example being weighted flow time—and scheduling with rejection. To this end, we identify crucial parameters that determine the problems’ complexity. In particular, we manage to cope with the problem complexity stemming from numeric input values, such as job processing times, which is usually a core bottleneck in the design of fixed-parameter algorithms. We complement our algorithms with W[1]-hardness results showing that for smaller sets of parameters the respective problems do not allow FPT-algorithms. In particular, our positive and negative results for scheduling with rejection explore a research direction proposed by Dániel Marx [1]. We hope that our contribution yields a new and fresh perspective on scheduling and fixed-parameter algorithms and will lead to further fruitful interdisciplinary research connecting these two areas.	algorithm;combinatorial optimization;makespan;mathematical optimization;parameterized complexity;rejection sampling;scheduling (computing);stemming	Matthias Mnich;Andreas Wiese	2013	CoRR		fair-share scheduling;nurse scheduling problem;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;flow shop scheduling;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;genetic algorithm scheduling;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	15.028022735004532	11.816553110365625	2952

Because the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol has been designed for single- hop networks, the performance of WLAN mesh networks degrades due to congestion, and buffer overflow in intermediate Mesh Nodes (MNs). In this article, we propose new congestion control scheme which applies Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) scheme and effective buffer usage to enhance the performance. AMC scheme uses multiple fragmentation thresholds, modulation levels and coding rates for various data sizes according to Channel State Information (CSI). Because CSI can be used more effectively to squeeze more bits into the medium, the throughput is enhanced. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves much higher throughput than other congestion control schemes.	access control;advanced mezzanine card;buffer overflow;channel state information;fragmentation (computing);mesh networking;modulation;network congestion;simulation;throughput	Minsheok Choi;Jinyoung Oh;Youngnam Han	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394403	ieee 802.11s;wireless mesh network;ieee 802.11;real-time computing;link adaptation;telecommunications;buffer overflow;computer science;mesh networking;shared mesh;channel state information;adaptive coding;network congestion;statistics;computer network	Mobile	6.915864953772944	93.25894761877579	2955

In order to understand the relative performance of suboptimum multiuser detectors including the matched filter detector, optimum multiuser detection in the context of the IS–95 downlink is first considered. A reduced complexity optimum detector that takes advantage of the structural properties of the IS–95 downlink and exhibits exponentially lower complexity than the brute-force optimum detector is developed. The Group Parallel Interference Cancellation (GPIC) detector, a suboptimum, lowcomplexity multiuser detector that also exploits the structure of the IS–95 downlink is then developed. Simulation evidence is presented that suggests that the performance of the GPIC detector may be near-optimum in several cases. The GPIC detector is also tested on a snapshot of on-air data measured with an omnidirectional antenna in an active IS–95 system and is shown to be effective for extracting weak downlink transmissions from strong out-of-cell cochannel interference. The results of this paper suggest that the GPIC detector offers the most performance gain in scenarios where weak downlink signals are corrupted by strong out-of-cell cochannel interference.	interference (communication);matched filter;mobile phone;multi-user;sensor;simulation;snapshot (computer storage);telecommunications link	D.

Based on the network traffic as well as past link and total virtual channel utilizations, the technique dynamically forecasts the number of virtual channels that should be active. It is based on an exponential smoothing forecasting method that filters out short-term traffic fluctuations. In this technique, for low (high) traffic loads, a small (large) number of VCs are allocated to the corresponding input channel. To assess the efficacy of the proposed method, the network on chip has been simulated using uniform, transpose, hotspot, NED, and realistic GSM voice codec traffic profiles. Simulation results show that up to a 35% reduction in the buffer power consumption and up to 20% savings in the overall router power consumption may be achieved. The area and power dissipation overheads of the technique are negligible.	clock gating;codec;java hotspot virtual machine;network on a chip;network packet;power management;router (computing);simulation;smoothing;speech coding;time complexity;vc dimension;virtual channel	Amir-Mohammad Rahmani;Masoud Daneshtalab;Ali Afzali-Kusha;Massoud Pedram	2009	J.

The solution here goes further in that it also supports the control of slow single-phase and fast three-phase charging through one and the same power electronic converter. A unified control methodology for the on-board chargers in electric vehicles is proposed. The control is distinguished in that it can perform four-quadrant operation while connected in single-phase or three-phase mode. The operation and network synchronization are automatically adjusted based on given terminal voltage and current measurements without the need for supplementary status signals. An analysis illustrates how the various measurements are processed for obtaining single- and three-phase flexibility while retaining compatibility with well-established methods of converter current mode control. The proposed control is validated via detailed simulation and demonstrated in a smart grid laboratory. The hardware implementation in the laboratory substantiates the claims of flexible single- and three-phase control.	autonomous robot;battery charger;computer simulation;electric power conversion;on-board data handling;phase inversion;phase-locked loop;power inverter;transformation matrix	Arnaldo Arancibia;Kai Strunz;Fernando Mancilla-David	2013	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2013.2271096	control engineering;electronic engineering;electric power;propulsion;power control;engineering;electrical engineering;phase-fired controllers;single-phase electric power	Robotics	64.409019521546	40.03944091903138	2976

Specifically, depending on the quality of the received signals, the relay sets prices and correspondingly charges the users utilizing its resources for their transmissions. The price is determined in such a way that the relay's revenue or system utility is maximized. Given the specified price, the users competitively employ the relay node to forward their signals. We model each user as a rational player, which aims at maximizing its own net utility through power allocation, and analyze the competition among the users within the framework of noncooperative game theory. It is shown that, in the game played by the users, there always exists a unique pure Nash equilibrium point that can be achieved through distributed iterations. Next, subject to the availability of complete information about the users at the relay, we propose a low-complexity uniform pricing algorithm and an optimal differentiated pricing algorithm, in which the relay either charges the users at a suboptimal uniform price or charges different users at different prices. We also show that, by applying the differentiated pricing algorithm that enforces the users to transmit at certain power levels, any system utility can be maximized. Extensive simulations are conducted to quantify the performance of the proposed methods.	algorithm;game theory;internet relay chat;iteration;nash equilibrium;simulation	Shaolei Ren;Mihaela van der Schaar	2011	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2011.2121064	algorithm design;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;relay channel	Mobile	34.813117962973585	88.96349253900311	2981

The FIR digital filters have a wide range of applications due to the features. Bounded input bounded output (BIBO) guarantees stability and is designed to provide linear phase at all frequencies. The bat algorithm is based on the local echolocation behaviors in the nature of the bats, and many areas such as system modeling, image processing and microwave are used.

50ce4f6a5e10b406b3ba19af05e5189b0198d00d	papr reduction scheme in mimo-ofdm systems with efficient embedded signaling		Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising transmission scheme for high performance broadband wireless communications. However, this technique suffers from a major drawback which is the high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the output signals. In order to overcome this issue, several methods that require the transmission of explicit Side Information (SI) bits have been proposed. In fact, the transmitted bits must be channel-encoded as they are particularly critical to the performance of the considered OFDM system. This channel-encoding highly increases the system complexity and also decreases the transmission data rate. For these reasons, we propose in this paper, two robust blind techniques that embed the (SI) implicitly into the OFDM frame. First, we investigate a new technique referred as Blind Space Time Bloc Codes (BSTBC) that is inspired from the conventional Selected Mapping (SLM) approach. This technique banks on an adequate embedded signaling that mainly consist on a specific Space Time Bloc Codes (STBC) patterns and a precoding sequences codebook. Second, in order to improve the signal detection process and the PAPR gain, we propose a new efficient combined Blind SLM-STBC (BSLM-STBC) method. Both methods have the benefit of resulting in an optimized scheme during the signal estimation process that is based on the Max-Log-Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) algorithm. Finally, the obtained performance evaluation results show that our proposed methods result in a spectacular PAPR reduction and furthermore lead to a perfect signal recovery at the receiver side.	algorithm;code;codebook;detection theory;embedded system;itil;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;performance evaluation;power architecture platform reference;spatial light modulator;uncompressed video	Mouna Sghaier;Fatma Abdelkefi;Mohamed Siala	2014	CoRR		real-time computing;telecommunications;mathematics	EDA	45.297583840436225	80.76235449699242	2986

Using this technique, we present three simple and intuitive polynomial-time combinatorial algorithms for the problem. Truemper's augmenting path algorithm is one of the simplest combinatorial algorithms for the problem, but runs in exponential-time. Our rst algorithm is a polynomial-time variant of Truemper's algorithm. Our second algorithm is an adaption of Goldberg and Tarjan's pre owpush algorithm. It is the rst polynomial-time pre ow-push algorithm in generalized networks. Our third algorithm is a variant of the Fat-Path capacity-scaling algorithm. It is much simpler than Radzik's variant and matches the best known complexity for the problem. We discuss practical improvements in implementation.	algorithm;flow network;image scaling;maximum flow problem;polynomial;time complexity	Éva Tardos;Kevin D.

The reaction nonlinearity is not globally Lipschitz in L2, but has Lipschitz properties depending on an L∞-norm bound. We reformulate the problem in an abstract setting as a modified Cauchy problem with homogeneous boundary conditions and solve it based on Banach contraction mapping theorem. Based on Sobolev and Moser-type inequalities we prove regularity of the local solutions in Sobolev spaces. We show that global existence of classical solutions holds if a uniform a-priori bound on the L∞-norm of the solution and boundary term exists.	boundary case;commutation theorem;contraction mapping;lotka–volterra equations;moser spindle;nonlinear system;nonlocal lagrangian	Lacra Pavel	2009	Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2009.5399792	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;sobolev inequality;topology;sobolev space;boundary value problem;control theory;mathematics	Theory	82.55692432712695	7.9242969090525435	2998

Given the everincreasing requirements for storage of several modern applications, this will continue to hold. However, despite this fact and the fact that their access times continue to be very slow (e.g., tens of seconds) the central issue of efficiently scheduling accesses to RTLs has not received the attention it deserves. This paper contributes a study of efficient scheduling algorithms for tape-based robotic storage libraries. It contributes novel algorithms and experimentally evaluates their performance comparing them against that of well-known algorithms found in other environments. The paper ’s main contribution, hierarchical scheduling algorithms, can offer significant performance improvements, such as approximately 50% shorter average service times, while at the same time providing fair schedules.	algorithm;experiment;library (computing);requirement;robot;scheduling (computing);tape library	Peter Triantafillou;Ioannis Georgiadis	1999		10.1109/DEXA.1999.795144	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;operating system;database;scheduling	HPC	-2.087875545322623	46.21371503943586	3002

The CDS plays a major role in routing, broadcasting, coverage and activity scheduling. To reduce the traffic during communication and prolong network lifetime, it is desirable to construct a minimum CDS (MCDS). For the MCDS problem, this kind of the networks usually has been modeled in unit disk graph (UDG), in which each node has the same transmission range. In this paper, a new distributed algorithm for MCDS problem in UDG with constant approximation ratio is introduced which has outstanding time complexity of O(1) and message complexity of O(n) .

We propose to use this residual for estimating the number of harmonics by combining a noise variance estimate with an order dependent penalty term. This leads to a joint estimator of the fundamental frequency and the order based on the same criterion. Via Monte Carlo simulations, the estimator is demonstrated to have good performance in terms of the percentage of correctly estimated orders.	filter bank;monte carlo method;simulation;spectral density estimation	Mads Græsbøll Christensen;Jesper Højvang Jensen;Andreas Jakobsson;Søren Holdt Jensen	2009	2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference	10.1186/1687-6180-2011-13	computer simulation;filter;statistical model;econometrics;mathematical optimization;multiple signal classification;mathematics;fundamental frequency;maximum likelihood;model selection;statistics;monte carlo method	HPC	55.94077793639624	11.729762168386968	3045

The problem is treated in a novel way by investigating preand post-equalization-based subcarrier selection for transmit power reduction in downlink transmissions. Analytical expressions are derived for upper bounds of the required fixed DC bias for both cases. The fixed DC bias is used to reduce the system complexity on one hand and to devise optimal subcarrier selection criteria on the other. Simulation results based on the proposed subcarrier selection reveal significant power reduction subject to the 10−4 bit error rate (BER) requirement for 10-Mbps 64-subcarrier MC-CDMA-based indoor optical wireless communication systems. In addition, the BER performance obtained from pre-equalization is shown to be no higher than that obtained from post-equalization for the same transmit power.	bit error rate;modulation;optical wireless;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;x.690	Muhammad Farooqui;Poompat Saengudomlert	2013	EURASIP J.

In scenarios where the transmission power is fixed, each link has the same cost and the minimum-hop path is selected. In situations where the transmission power can be varied with the distance of the link, the link cost is higher for longer hops; the energy-aware routing algorithms select a path with a large number of small-distance hops. In this paper, we argue that such a formulation based solely on the energy spent in a single transmission is misleading --- the proper metric should include the total energy (including that expended for any retransmissions necessary) spent in reliably delivering the packet to its final destination.We first study how link error rates affect this retransmission-aware metric, and how it leads to an efficient choice between a path with a large number of short-distance hops and another with a smaller number of large-distance hops. Such studies motivate the definition of a link cost that is a function of both the energy required for a single transmission attempt across the link and the link error rate. This cost function captures the cumulative energy expended in reliable data transfer, for both reliable and unreliable link layers. Finally, through detailed simulations, we show that our schemes can lead to upto 30-70% energy savings over best known current schemes, under realistic environments.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;bit error rate;control knob;enhanced entity–relationship model;hoc (programming language);ieee 754-1985;loss function;low-power broadcasting;network packet;requirement;retransmission (data networks);routing;simulation;throughput	Suman Banerjee;Archan Misra	2002		10.1145/513800.513818	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	8.777058131469486	85.53530294272251	3048

Prior to signal detection, adaptive receivers must either """"null"""" or """"whiten"""" the clutter. The former approach requires estimates of the basis vectors of the clutter subspace while the latter requires estimates of the covariance matrix of the clutter. It may be preferable to null the clutter when the dimensionality of the clutter subspace (M) is small in comparison to the length of the data vector coherently processed (N) and also when the signal to be detected is not substantially within the clutter-plus-noise subspace. Depending on the scenario, radar clutter data may have a variety of effects such as clutter discretes, data dropouts due to terrain masking that cause shadowing, multipath effects, and non-Gaussian amplitude statistics. We consider a statistical model which can account for some of these effects and apply the model to design an algorithm to obtain a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the orthonormal basis vectors of the clutter-plus-noise subspace. We show that the problem can be reformulated to develop a recursive approach for MLE based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Results of the analysis show that each training vector must be scaled by a nonnegative scale factor from the interval [0,1] prior to subspace estimation. The scale factor applied to each training vector increases monotonically with the subspace clutter-plus-noise power of the vector. Conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the solution are considered.

Let F denote the feasible region for the linear constraints. We first show that replacing the quadratic objective and constraint functions with their convex lower envelopes on F is dominated by an alternative methodology based on convexifying the range of the quadratic form ( 1 x )( 1 x )T for x ∈ F . We next show that the use of “αBB” underestimators as computable estimates of convex lower envelopes is dominated by a relaxation of the convex hull of the quadratic form that imposes semidefiniteness and linear constraints on diagonal terms. Finally, we show that the use of a large class of “D.C.” underestimators is dominated by a relaxation that combines semidefiniteness with RLT constraints.	computable function;convex hull;feasible region;linear programming relaxation;quadratic function;quadratic programming;quadratically constrained quadratic program	Kurt M.

The effectiveness of this approach depends on two key factors: the quality of constraints used to generate test vectors, and the randomness of solutions generated from a given set of constraints. In this paper, we focus on the second problem, and present an algorithm that significantly improves the state-of-the-art of (almost-)uniform generation of solutions of large Boolean constraints. Our algorithm provides strong theoretical guarantees on the uniformity of generated solutions and scales to problems involving hundreds of thousands of variables.	algorithm;boolean satisfiability problem;circuit complexity;conjunctive normal form;randomness;scalability;simulation	Supratik Chakraborty;Kuldeep S.

It is therefore necessary to fix crosstalk violations in the clock tree by making minimal design changes and maintaining skew bounds. We propose a novel approach for making engineering change order (ECO) changes in the clock network to remove crosstalk violations. A two-pronged approach based on wire-translocation and rerouting is presented. Wire translocation, i.e., changing the track for a net to another free track with less crosstalk, eliminates a large percentage of removable violations. A linear time procedure to check if a violation is removable by translocation is developed. Next, an efficient rerouting method based on an incremental loci-finding algorithm is combined with linear time dynamic programming approach to eliminate the remaining crosstalk violations. Simulation results for randomly-generated clock tree of different sizes and benchmark circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach	algorithm;benchmark (computing);clock network;clock signal;computational complexity theory;crosstalk;digital electronics;dynamic programming;engineering change order;mathematical optimization;randomness;removable media;simulation;time complexity;wire wrap	Amit Kumar;Krishnendu Chakrabarty;Chunduri Rama Mohan	2007	20th International Conference on VLSI Design held jointly with 6th International Conference on Embedded Systems (VLSID'07)	10.1109/VLSID.2007.30	time complexity;embedded system;routing;electronic engineering;real-time computing;crosstalk;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;digital clock manager;digital electronics;engineering change order;integrated circuit design	EDA	18.139304014400253	51.55877002476242	3062

QR decomposition (QRD) of the channel matrix is a crucial part of MIMO detection algorithms, such as successive interference cancellation or sphere detection. Modern standards like Long Term Evolution (LTE) require the processing of millions of matrices per second, in order to compensate channel changes that occur due to the mobility of the detector and Doppler spread. We introduce a new architecture for minimum mean square error (MMSE) sorted QR decomposition based on Givens rotations. The architecture is derived from classical systolic array approach but includes modifications to allow sorting and MMSE preprocessing. It balances throughput against area and fulfills the real-time requirements of 1.763 μs and 0.881 μs derived from the LTE MIMO standard when synthesized on ALTERA Stratix III and Stratix V family FPGAs. Moreover, it can trade speed for area and is suitable for tighter time constraints.	algorithm;bell laboratories layered space-time;compaq lte;electronic circuit;fault injection;field-programmable gate array;interference (communication);mimo;mean squared error;preprocessor;qr decomposition;real-time clock;requirement;sorting;stratix;systolic array;throughput	Victor Tomashevich;Christina Gimmler-Dumont;Christian Fesl;Norbert Wehn;Ilia Polian	2014	17th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems	10.1109/DDECS.2014.6868800	electronic engineering;real-time computing;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;computer science;sorting;processor register;matrix decomposition;algorithm;statistics;mimo	Arch	46.769965881888346	64.37847479007469	3063

The interval method considered is based on the conventional backward finite difference method. Moreover, it takes into account a formula of a local truncation error of the method. Such local truncation error of the conventional method is bounded by the appropriate interval values. In most scientific applications we cannot find the endpoints of such intervals exactly and it is of great importance to approximate them in the most accurate way. The paper presents a method of such approximation.	coefficient;finite difference method	Malgorzata A.

ee3ad9b9c6b175ac6a43a2d413885a822b415a80	loss minimization control of linear induction motor drive for linear metros		The linear induction motor (LIM) drive in linear metros suffers heavily from low efficiency due to its large air-gap length and the partial load conditions, where high loss appears in both the LIM and the inverter when a constant excitation current is generally required. Worse still, the end-effects, including both the transversal edge-effect and longitudinal end-effect, would lead to the decrease of magnetizing inductance and the increase of secondary resistance, resulting in extra loss and further deterioration of drive efficiency. To reduce the loss of the LIM drive, this paper proposes a novel loss model based loss minimization control (LMC) scheme for LIM drives. First, in the equivalent circuit and the mathematical model of LIM, four coefficients are introduced to evaluate the influence of the end-effects. Based on a thorough analysis of the LIM copper and core losses, together with the inverter conduction and switching losses, a novel integrated loss model of LIM drive is then developed, and an improved LMC scheme to obtain the optimal solution online is proposed to minimize the loss of the LIM drive. The proposed control method is successfully implemented in a 3-kW LIM drive prototype. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by the experimental results.	coefficient;equivalent circuit;little man computer;mathematical model;power inverter;prototype	Dong Hu;Weiqiang Liu;Renjun Dian;Yi Liu;Jianguo G.

The extreme low-resistivity of the Si-substrate and the absence of thick top metal layers in digital-CMOS processes prevent the implementation of high-Q passive inductors, and demand alternate solutions. A detailed comparison between the active and passive inductors based on several performance criteria such as Q-factor, area, tunability, noise, linearity, EMI, floor-planning etc reveals the tremendous potential of the high-Q tunable active inductors. An optimization guideline for the grounded-inductor topology has also been suggested. As a basis of comparison, oscillators have been implemented using both the inductors.

TCAD tools must not only model real processes accurately, to allow predictive simulation during technology research and development, but must work together as an integrated system to allow efficient exploration of new technology options and to perform numerical experiments. Cellular automata (CAs) have been applied successfully to the simulation of several physical systems and processes, and have been extensively used as VLSI architecture. This paper describes a TCAD system for the simulation of the two-dimensional (2-D) chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. The TCAD system is fully automated and is also able to support, the hardware implementation of the corresponding CA algorithm, leading to its execution by dedicated parallel processor. The obtained simulation profiles of the CVD process are in very good qualitative agreement with experimental and simulation results found in the literature. The proposed system produces as output the corresponding VHDL code, which leads to the very large-scale integrated (VLSI) implementation of the CA algorithm. Furthermore, a user-friendly interface that enables easy and effective interaction between the user and the TCAD system has been developed. No prior knowledge of VHDL is required by the user. The produced VHDL code is synthesizable and can be used for the automated design of the corresponding VLSI system, using a commercial VLSI CAD system. r 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We consider an (α, g)-switch policy; these policies provide a generalization of the MaxWeight policies of Tassiulas and Ephremides (IEEE Trans Autom Control 37(12):4936–1948, 1992) and the weighted α-fair with allocations of Mo andWalrand (IEEE/ACM Trans Netw 8(5):556–567, 2000) which are typically applied to Bandwidth Sharing Networks (Massoulié and Roberts in IEEE/ACM Trans Netw 10(3):320–328, 2002). For single-hop switch networks, we prove the maximum stability property for this class of randomized policies. Thus these policies have the same first-order behavior as the MaxWeight policies. However, for multihop networks some of these generalized polices address a number of critical weakness of the MaxWeight/BackPressure policies. For multihop networks with fixed routing, we consider a policy called the Proportional Scheduler (or (1, log)-policy). In this setting, the BackPressure policy is maximum stable, but must maintain a queue at each node for every route destination, which typically grows rapidly with a network’s size. However, the Proportional Scheduler only needs to maintain a queue for each outgoing link, which is typically bounded in number. As is common with Internet routing, by maintaining per-link queueing, each node only needs to know the next hop for each packet and not its entire route. Further, in contrast to BackPressure, the Proportional Scheduler does not compare downstream queue lengths to determine weights; only local link information is required. This leads to greater potential for decomposed implementations of the policy. Through a reduction argument and an entropy argument, we demonstrate that, B Neil Walton n.s.walton@uva.nl 1 University of Amsterdam, Science Park 904, 1098 XH Amsterdam, The Netherlands		Neil Walton	2015	Queueing Syst.	10.1007/s11134-015-9447-9	real-time computing;network switch;computer science;back pressure;backpressure routing;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	14.285988506915912	95.67801960476474	3099

Wireless sensor network (WSN)-based control systems are an alternative solution involving lower setup and maintenance costs and reduced sensor noise. However, WSN-based control systems also encounter problems such as possible data loss, irregular sampling periods (due to the uncertainty of the wireless channel), and the possibility of sensor breakdown (due to the increased complexity of the overall control system). In this paper, a wireless microcontroller-based control system is designed and implemented to wirelessly perform vibration control. The wireless microcontroller-based system is quite different from regular control systems due to its limited speed and computational power. Hardware, software, and control algorithm design are described in detail to demonstrate this prototype. Model and system state compensation is used in the wireless control system to solve the problems of data loss and sensor breakdown. A positive position feedback controller is used as the control law for the task of active vibration suppression. Both wired and wireless controllers are implemented. The results show that the WSN-based control system can be successfully used to suppress the vibration and produces resilient results in the presence of sensor failure.	actuator device component;algorithm design;cns disorder;control system;control theory;controllers;disintegration (morphologic abnormality);financial cost;game controller;heart failure;image noise;microcontroller;node - plant part;optimal control;preparation;prototype;sampling (signal processing);sensor;sensor node;simulation;simulators;wiring;zero suppression	Peng Li;Luyu Li;Gangbing Song;Yan Yu	2014	IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics	10.1109/TCYB.2014.2306811	wireless sensor network;sensor node;control theory;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	65.67483567438796	32.9255307788137	3101

The initial contribution is a very simple insertion procedure which (in comparison to the standard approach) has the effect of dramatically reducing the variance of the number of probes required for a search. This leads to a new search procedure which requires only a constant number of probes, on average, even for full tables. Finally, an extension to these methods yields a new, simple way of performing deletions and subsequent insertions. Experimental results strongly indicate little degeneration in search time. In particular deletions and successful searches appear to require constant time (≪ 2.57 probes) and insertions and unsuccessful searches, O(logn).	hood method;hash function	Pedro Celis;Per-Åke Larson;J.

The presented architecture allows efficient memory utilization in addition to resource saving. Synthesis results confirmed the resource reduction and speed up advantages of our design.

5f32422baca9898afbb986ebf8402ac9eb2167a8	a short proof of the tree-packing theorem	packing;spanning tree	We give a short elementary proof of Tutte and Nash-Williams’ characterization of graphs with k edge-disjoint spanning trees. We deal with graphs that may have parallel edges and loops; the vertex and edge sets of a graph H are denoted by V (H) and E(H), respectively. Let G be a graph. If P is a partition of V (G), we let G/P be the graph on the set P with an edge joining distinct vertices P1, P2 ∈ P for every edge of G with one end in P1 and another in P2. Tutte [5] and Nash-Williams [3] proved the following classical result: Theorem 1. A graph G contains k pairwise edge-disjoint spanning trees if and only if for every partition P of V (G), the graph G/P has at least k(|P|−1) edges. An elegant proof of Theorem 1 is based on the matroid union theorem (see, e.g., [4, Corollary 51.1a]); a relatively short elementary proof appears in [1, Theorem 2.4.1]. In this paper, we give another elementary proof which is also short and perhaps somewhat more straightforward. The argument directly translates to an efficient algorithm to find either k disjoint spanning trees, or a proof that none exist. To an extent, the method can also be applied to the packing of structures without the matroidal properties of spanning trees, as shown, e.g., in the forthcoming paper [2]. Let k ≥ 1 and T = (T1, . . . , Tk) be an ordered partition of G into k spanning subgraphs of G. We define the sequence P0, P1, . . . ,P∞ of partitions of V (G) associated with T as follows. First, P0 = {V (G)}. For i ≥ 0, if there is c ∈ {1, . . . , k} such that the induced subgraph Tc[P ] is disconnected for some P ∈ Pi, then ci is defined as the least such c and Pi+1 consists of the vertex sets of all ∗Department of Mathematics and Institute for Theoretical Computer Science (ITI), University of West Bohemia, Univerzitńı 8, 306 14 Plzeň, Czech Republic.

Assuming that the data symbols are mapped into points of fixed signal constellations, a transceiver structure employing widely linear (WL) filters, rather than linear ones, is proposed in order to exploit the statistical redundancy of some constellations, i.e., the correlation between the signals and their conjugate version. WL filters linearly and independently process both the in-phase and the quadrature components of the input signals and, with a limited increase in the computational complexity, allows one to improve the system performances. It is shown that, by representing the basic system model in terms of in-phase and quadrature components, the proposed structure can be derived by utilizing the already existing procedure for the design of the linear transceiver according to the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) criterion. The performances of the WL and linear transceivers are compared in terms of mean-square error, symbol error rate, and achieved multiplexing gain.	apple a5;apple a7;apple a9;approximation algorithm;channel state information;computational complexity theory;digital subchannel;eigen (c++ library);in-phase and quadrature components;interlaced video;mimo;mean squared error;multiplexing;noise power;performance;portable document format;redundancy (information theory);the matrix;transceiver;transmitter	Fabio Sterle	2007	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2007.895997	telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;computer performance;statistics;transceiver	Mobile	46.60236356963565	71.97494317783476	3113

Based on such logical view of the network, communications protocols should be more efficient than based on a classical flat approach. Numerous studies deal with performance evaluation of these virtual backbones and clusters in terms of energy consumption, complexity, etc. Nevertheless, the network is always assumed fully deployed. In our point of view, a more accurate analysis should be done in order to characterize self- organization strategies during the different steps of the WSN life. We propose to study the key properties like robustness, latency or cardinality of the main self-organization strategies (MPR, MPR-DS, CDS-rule k, CDS-MIS) during the chaotic network deployment (birth phase), the working life dealing with self-healing and the death of nodes.	cds isis;communications protocol;connected dominating set;delimiter;emergence;internet backbone;life & death;logical topology;minkowski portal refinement;performance evaluation;programming paradigm;self-organization;software deployment	Karel Heurtefeux;Fabrice Valois	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394113	communications protocol;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	5.800968520315454	78.79447806318231	3118

Among several proposed algorithms, fingerprint algorithm stands as one of the most accurate systems for localization. However, there is a lack of theoretical basis and understanding on the orientation of the user. This paper presents a model for orientation-aware indoor location tracking system using a Zigbee based protocol wireless sensor called Sun's SPOT (Small Programmable Object Technology). Our experiment shows better accuracy in location tracking when orientation and attenuation factors are considered for the path loss prediction model than the traditional path loss model. Orientation-aware fingerprint algorithm is also examined in our experiment to have a basis of comparison on an empirical algorithm.

The cubic displacement involved in fractional operator is used to describe the higher-order viscoelastic behavior of materials and of aerodynamic damping. The residue harmonic balance method is employed to analytically generate higher-order approximations for the steady state responses of an autonomous system. Nonlinear dynamic behaviors of the harmonically forced oscillator are further explored by the harmonic balance method along with the polynomial homotopy continuation technique. A parametric investigation is carried out to analyze the effects of fractional order of damping and the effect of the magnitude of imposed excitation on the system using amplitude-frequency curves. Jump avoidance conditions are addressed. Neimark bifurcations are captured to delineate regions of instability. The existence of even harmonics in the Fourier expansions implies symmetry-breaking bifurcation in certain combinations of system parameters. Numerical simulations are given by comparing with analytical solutions for validation purpose. We find that all Neimark bifurcation points in the response diagram always exist along a straight line.	nonlinear system;van der pol oscillator	A. Y. T. Leung;H. X. Yang;P. Zhu	2013	I. J.

For example, in environmental monitoring, missing temperature, pressure and humidity level samples can often be inferred by spatial and/or temporal interpolations. In this paper we propose and study an adaptive p-persistent CSMA-based media access control protocol that supports end-to-end probabilistic reliability for sensor networks on a hop-by-hop basis. In an effort to reduce the probability of packet collisions, first we tune the carrier sensing range of the nodes; then given an end-to-end reliability requirement, we determine the optimal allocation of per-hop reliability requirements on each route to minimize the expected total number of transmissions needed; finally, our adaptive p-persistent CSMA protocol tunes its link persistence probability to further reduce the expected total number of transmissions, and thereby minimizes the energy consumption in the network. We formulate this latter problem as a constrained optimization problem, and then derive an algorithm to adapt the link persistence probabilities using the Lagrangian dual decomposition method.	access control;algorithm;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;hop-by-hop transport;interpolation;lagrange multiplier;lagrangian relaxation;mathematical optimization;missing data;network packet;optimization problem;persistence (computer science);requirement	Junhua Zhu;Brahim Bensaou	2008		10.1145/1454503.1454564	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;environmental monitoring;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	11.181095576614313	80.75304767919756	3128

Therefore, well-defined phase relationships among multiple clocks are required to perform correct read/write operations. A GDDR5 system solves this problem by adaptive clock synchronization training. For such multiple clocks synchronization training at controller side this paper proposes two simplified architectures based on: a) Unit-delay incrementer, b) PI (Phase-Interpolator) based PLL (Phase-Locked Loop). Experiments show that the proposed unit-delay architecture consumes only 0.89 mW power and 100 (μm)2 area in 65nm which is 16.8 times less power and 35 times less area than other works while power and area consumed in the PI-based PLL architecture depends upon the complexity of the PI itself.	clock synchronization;emoticon;group delay and phase delay;memory bandwidth;phase-locked loop;source-synchronous	Ashok Jaiswal;Yuan Fang;Peter Gregorius;Klaus Hofmann	2013	2013 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design	10.1109/DSD.2013.86	clock synchronization;circuit complexity;synchronization;real-time computing;phase-locked loop;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;low-power electronics	EDA	59.00303150532996	51.183033931316494	3130

The outage-constrained weighted sum rate maximization problem is a nonconvex optimization problem and is difficult to solve. While it is possible to optimally deal with this problem in an exhaustive search manner by finding all the Pareto-optimal rate tuples in the (discretized) outage-constrained achievable rate region, this approach, however, suffers from a prohibitive computational complexity and is feasible only when the number of transmitter-receive pairs is small. In this paper, we propose a convex optimization based approximation method for efficiently handling the outage-constrained weighted sum rate maximization problem. The proposed approximation method consists of solving a sequence of convex optimization problems, and thus can be efficiently implemented by interior-point methods. Simulation results show that the proposed method can yield near-optimal solutions.	approximation;brute-force search;computation;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;discretization;downtime;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;industry foundation classes;interference (communication);interior point method;mathematical optimization;multi-user;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;simulation;system analysis;transmitter;weight function	Wei-Chiang Li;Tsung-Hui Chang;Che Lin;Chong-Yung Chi	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5947107	mathematical optimization;transmitter;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;convex optimization;index term;entropy maximization;computer science;interior point method;brute-force search;mathematics;computational complexity theory;time division multiple access	Robotics	37.13497968793979	90.2532128510144	3135

Due to salient features of sensor networks, the security design for WSN is significantly challenging. Despite a good number of available surveys on this particular topic, we feel that there is a gap in the existing literature in terms of timeliness, emphasis, and comprehensiveness. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art for secure WSN routing protocols that illustrates the issues and challenges in the context design matters. Further, we propose the schematic taxonomy of key design issues for WSN routing protocols. We also define design factors categorization relevant to secure routing: basic, essential, and optional. The similarities and differences of secure routing approaches are summarized on the basis of key design attributes, security objectives, and attacks prevention. Finally, we outline possible future research trends on secure routing design in WSN. & 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

55d8c93a5402982262fa76285c4f34cd9974bccf	a new path-constrained rendezvous planning approach for large-scale event-driven wireless sensor networks	energy efficiency;fuzzy decision system;mobile sink;rendezvous point planning;wireless sensor network	We study the problem of employing a mobile-sink into a large-scale Event-Driven Wireless Sensor Networks (EWSNs) for the purpose of data harvesting from sensor-nodes. Generally, this employment improves the main weakness of WSNs that is about energy-consumption in battery-driven sensor-nodes. The main motivation of our work is to address challenges which are related to a network’s topology by adopting a mobile-sink that moves in a predefined trajectory in the environment. Since, in this fashion, it is not possible to gather data from sensor-nodes individually, we adopt the approach of defining some of the sensor-nodes as Rendezvous Points (RPs) in the network. We argue that RP-planning in this case is a tradeoff between minimizing the number of RPs while decreasing the number of hops for a sensor-node that needs data transformation to the related RP which leads to minimizing average energy consumption in the network. We address the problem by formulating the challenges and expectations as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Henceforth, by proving the NP-hardness of the problem, we propose three effective and distributed heuristics for RP-planning, identifying sojourn locations, and constructing routing trees. Finally, experimental results prove the effectiveness of our approach.	anatomy, regional;bloc1s3 gene;cns disorder;cessation of life;computer simulation;conflict (psychology);drug vehicle;event-driven programming;experiment;family computer disk system;hl7 2.5 event type;heuristics;integer (number);integer programming;linear programming;manuscripts;np-hardness;natural science disciplines;node - plant part;numerical analysis;rp (complexity);robot (device);routing;sensor node;trees (plant)	Ahmadreza Vajdi;Gongxuan Zhang;Junlong Zhou;Tongquan Wei;Yongli Wang;Tianshu Wang	2018		10.3390/s18051434	electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;engineering;path-constrained rendezvous;rendezvous;efficient energy use;energy consumption;distributed computing;trajectory;integer programming;heuristics	AI	11.24100243890137	79.0098508127507	3150

However, soft demodulating a high-order QAM constellation is complicated when applying traditional methods. In this paper, a novel de-mapper is proposed based on the fact that the clipped LLR can also offer sufficient soft-information, meanwhile the theoretical LLR curves are approximately linear in this clipped range. Hence a first-order linear function is designed to approximate the theoretical value. Simulation results and complexity analysis demonstrate that the proposed de-mapper outperforms traditional approaches in terms of BER performance, and also keeps low complexity.	analysis of algorithms;approximation algorithm;first-order predicate;first-order reduction;linear approximation;linear function;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;modulation;simulation;x.690	Yanbin Yao;Yongtao Su;Jinglin Shi;Jiangnan Lin	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343340	quadrature amplitude modulation;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio	Embedded	48.04403473380427	77.74248082469396	3151

The circuit consists of a two-stage topology to implement a low noise amplifier based on the TSMC 0.18-mum RF CMOS process. The first stage is the folded cascode configuration that is used to attain low-power dissipation and low supply voltage. Negative feedback is adopted to enhance the bandwidth of the first stage. In order to achieve simultaneously a high gain and ultra-wide bandwidth, the addition of a common-source stage behind the folded cascode circuit provides extra gain and gain flatness. A RLC shunt-shunt feedback is used to attain the broadband gain requirement of the second stage. The simulated results show the better performances of S21 above 12dB and noise figure below 3.6dB with the 3-dB bandwidth covering from 3.1GHz to 10.6GHz. The first-stage circuit of LNA drains 22mA from a 0.9V supply and the second-stage circuit of LNA drains 8mA from a 0.85V supply voltage. The total circuit consumes a very low power of 27mW.

Färnqvist et al. have introduced a parameter on the space of graphs that allows close study of t he approximability properties of MAX H -COL. Specifically, it can be used to extend previously known (in) approximability results to larger classes of graphs. Here, we investigate the proper ties of this parameter on circular complete graphsKp/q, where2 ≤ p/q ≤ 3. The results are extended to K4-minor-free graphs and graphs with bounded maximum average degree. We also cons ider connections with Šámal’s work on fractional covering by cuts: we address, and decide, two conjectures concerning cubical chromatic numbers.	approximation algorithm;graph homomorphism;max;maximal set	Robert Engström;Tommy Färnqvist;Peter Jonsson;Johan Thapper	2009	CoRR		degeneracy;1-planar graph;claw-free graph;outerplanar graph;block graph;pathwidth;split graph;factor-critical graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;cograph;universal graph;topology;pancyclic graph;forbidden graph characterization;symmetric graph;graph factorization;mathematics;distance-hereditary graph;approximation property;graph homomorphism;butterfly graph;complete graph;book embedding;line graph;coxeter graph	Theory	26.75311583135335	25.978280474295072	3163

Such methods converge rapidly near a solution but may not be reliable from arbitrary starting points. The well known software package MINOS has proven effective on many large problems. Its success motivates us to propose a variant of the LCL method that possesses three important properties: it is globally convergent, the subproblem constraints are always feasible, and the subproblems may be solved inexactly. The new algorithm has been implemented in Matlab, with the option to use either the MINOS or SNOPT Fortran codes to solve the linearly constrained subproblems. Only first derivatives are required. We present numerical results on a nonlinear subset of the COPS, HS, and CUTE test problems, which include many large examples. The results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the stabilized LCL procedure.	ampl;algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;automatic differentiation;binary combinatory logic;cops (software);code;computation;converge;expect;failure rate;first-order predicate;fortran;gams;iteration;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;local convergence;matlab;minos (optimization software);mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;penalty method;program optimization;quantum lc circuit;refinement (computing);retrospect (software);snopt;sequential quadratic programming;solver;stationary process;stellar classification;terminate (software);whole earth 'lectronic link	Michael P.

In particular, the results obtained by the same authors for RC tree circuits are generalized, allowing for a deep understanding of the impact of the inductance. The modeling approach proposed relies on the adoption of an equivalent second-order RLC circuit, whose energy consumption is evaluated in a closed form. These results are then extended to RLC circuits with arbitrary order, deriving a simple and accurate model. The energy dependence on the input rise time is also analyzed in detail, identifying the ranges for which the RLC circuit can be approximated to a simple capacitance or an RC circuit. The model equations provide an insight into the dependence of the energy consumption on the circuit parameters. Indeed, the energy is explicitly expressed as a function of the resistances, capacitances and inductances of the original network. The energy model proposed is shown to be accurate enough for modeling purposes through comparison with SPICE simulations, as the error is typically in the order of a few percentage points.	approximation algorithm;integrated circuit;rc circuit;rlc circuit;rise time;spice;simulation	Massimo Alioto;Gaetano Palumbo;Massimo Poli	2009	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2004546	control engineering;electronic engineering;inductance;engineering;electrical engineering;very-large-scale integration;second-order logic;rlc circuit;power network design;low-power electronics;integrated circuit design	EDA	24.143318088526673	58.81988551383352	3167
36dc69d44bd39d07afd549da9c80f3f1395cbd22	removing even crossings on surfaces	crossing number	In this paper we investigate how certain results related to the HananiTutte theorem can be extended to surfaces other than the plane. We give a new simple, topological proof that the weak Hanani-Tutte theorem is true on arbitrary surfaces, both orientable and nonorientable. We apply these results and the proof techniques to obtain new and old results about generalized thrackles, including that every bipartite generalized thrackle in a surface S can be embedded in S. We also extend a result of Pach and Tóth that allows the redrawing of a graph so as to remove all crossings with even edges to arbitrary surfaces. From this we can conclude that crS(G), the crossing number of the graph G on surface S, is bounded by 2 ocrS(G) , where ocrS(G) is the odd crossing number of G on surface S. Finally, we prove that ocrS(G) = crS(G) whenever ocrS(G) ≤ 2, for any surface S.	crossing number (graph theory);embedded system;hanani–tutte theorem;thrackle;tutte theorem	Michael J.

To address this problem, we propose an enhanced transport-layer protocol called gHSTCP, which is based on the HighSpeed TCP proposed by S. Floyd (see RFC 3649, 2003). By monitoring the changing trend of RTT (round trip time), gHSTCP adapts to the traffic load by switching between two congestion control modes, which is shown to provide significant performance improvement against traditional TCP Reno in terms of throughput and fairness. Furthermore, it is observed that the performance of gHSTCP is limited by both TailDrop and RED/ARED routers, thus we develop a modified adaptive RED called gARED to address the problem of simultaneous packet drops among multiple flows. By adapting to the trend in variation of the average queue length, gARED performs active queue management more effectively than ARED. Simulations show that combining gHSTCP with gARED leads to achieving utilization of network bandwidth and good fairness.	profiling (computer programming)	Zongsheng Zhang;Go Hasegawa;Masayuki Murata	2004		10.1109/MASCOT.2004.1348306	compound tcp;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;telecommunications;computer science;transmission control protocol;explicit congestion notification;h-tcp;tcp vegas;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;network congestion;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;active queue management;slow-start;transport layer;computer network	HPC	-3.641927449572222	94.40630913912388	3189
58af4bd5d1efc77af2bb70351622e124e0469d87	a big data architecture for spectrum monitoring in cognitive radio applications	spectrum sensing;big data;nosql;mapreduce;performance evaluation	Cognitive radio has emerged as a promising candidate solution to improve spectrum utilization in next-generation wireless networks. A crucial requirement for future cognitive radio networks is the wideband spectrum sensing, which allows detecting spectral opportunities across a wide frequency range. On the other hand, the Internet of Things concept has revolutionized the usage of sensors and of the relevant data. Connecting sensors to cloud computing infrastructure enables the so-called paradigm of Sensing as a Service (S2aaS). In this paper, we present an S2aaS architecture to offer the Spectrum Sensing as a Service (S3aaS), by exploiting the flexibility of software-defined radio. We believe that S3aaS is a crucial step to simplify the implementation of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio. We illustrate the system components for the S3aaS, highlighting the system design choices, especially for the management and processing of the large amount of data coming from the spectrum sensors. We analyze the connectivity requirements between the sensors and the processing platform, and evaluate the trade-offs between required bandwidth and target service delay. Finally, we show the implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype, used for assessing the effectiveness of the whole system in operation with respect to a legacy processing architecture.	big data;cognitive radio;data architecture	Giuseppe Baruffa;Mauro Femminella;Matteo Pergolesi;Gianluca Reali	2018	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/s12243-018-0642-7	electronic engineering;architecture;wireless network;cognitive radio;cloud computing;computer network;big data;systems design;mathematics;wideband;bandwidth (signal processing)	Mobile	22.090516502055728	86.12872144996177	3198

Countermeasures, reducing the standby current and its spread can be classified into 3 categories: First, improved devices can reduce leakage sources by orders of magnitude, requiring completely new process steps. Next, performance and leakage can be traded off for conventional technologies. Low leakage devices control standby currents but their performance loss will reduce applicability. Finally, power management implements and controls circuits, where leakage and performance can be tuned at run-time, saving power on idle. This part of the special session will focus on design of new devices, reducing the negative dependence on channel length, oxide thickness, and body potential and improving the switching behavior. Afterwards, device and circuit level techniques tackling drawbacks of popular power management techniques are presented. For power gating, this means a reduction of the recovery current, a circuit style having a predictable timing and low area overhead, and a design stabilizing the interface towards ungated parts. For body biasing, body currents dominating reverse bias and even influencing forward bias have to be regarded and controlled. The gain of state assignment techniques, which are easy to use with conventional EDA tools, needs to be boosted to justify their application.	biasing;countermeasure (computer);high-κ dielectric;image scaling;logic synthesis;overhead (computing);power gating;power management;p–n diode;p–n junction;spectral leakage;thickness (graph theory);time complexity	Domenik Helms;Wolfgang Nebel	2007	2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511141	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	19.122094990586284	58.39295918695506	3211

Different node allocation schemes will lead to the different sensing performance between the sub-bands that compose the wideband. If the detection accuracy of some sub-band is much low, the primary user (PU) will be interfered severely. Thus, the system fairness which is measured by the minimum sensing performance between the sub-bands is proposed. In order to guarantee wideband spectrum sensing fairness, in this paper, we investigate node allocation schemes to maximize the minimum sensing performance between the sub-bands. we propose iterative hierarchical hungarian allocation(IHHA), bow-shaped allocation(BSA), class division allocation(CDA) to realize the Max-Min objective. Furthermore, on the basis of PU priority level and anti-interference capability, the frequency band property parameter (BPP) is defined. By improving the minimum sensing performance with BPP, modified fairness that suits for the actual scene is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed schemes perform excellently in improving the overall sensing fairness of the whole system.	bpp (complexity);cognitive radio;fairness measure;frequency band;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);iterative method;simulation	Shang Liu;Long Zhang;Qixun Zhang	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666568	fairness measure;cognitive radio;max-min fairness;telecommunications;computer science;iterative method;detection theory;computer network	Mobile	33.79689481114515	90.01688815168112	3218

In the A@aFEM, the piecewise constant strain field of linear triangular FEM models is enhanced by additional strain terms with an adjustable parameter @a which results in an effectively softer stiffness formulation compared to a linear triangular element. The element is further extended to the free and forced vibration analyses of solids. Several numerical examples show that the A@aFEM achieves high reliability compared to other existing elements in the literature.	finite element method;triangle mesh;triangulated irregular network	N.

Synchronized phasor measurements, on the other hand, can track those dynamics but, in a foreseeable future, they will be available in scarce configurations that do not allow estimating the whole system state. State reconstruction precisely aims at using the available phasor measurements to track the evolution of the power system - at least in a region of interest - in between two runs of a traditional state estimator. It minimizes under constraints a weighted least square objective involving both the phasor measurements and bus power pseudo-measurements relative to a reference state. The placement of phasor measurement units at the generator buses is recommended for accuracy. Tests are reported with phasor measurements obtained from time simulation of post-disturbance system evolution. The results deal with the effect on accuracy of the relative weights assigned to phasor and pseudo-measurements, the benefit of taking the reference bus powers from the last reconstructed instead of the pre-disturbance state, and the rate of the state reconstructions.	algorithm;coherent states;computation;constrained optimization;instability;local variable;mathematical optimization;observable;phasor;power management unit;pseudo-spectral method;region of interest;simulation;sparse matrix;subnetwork	Mevludin Glavic;Th.

However, poor reliability and yield of TSV interconnects remain major challenges of this promising technology. In this paper, we propose an efficient Built-In Self-Repair (TSV-BISR) strategy for TSV faults due to manufacturing and aging defects. After interconnect tests, we replace faulty TSVs with fault-free spares using shift operations. Among the benefits of this solution is that the self-repair signals are determined on-chip without any external intervention. Moreover, we show that with TSV-BISR better reparability is achieved with fewer spares than in existing TSV repair techniques. We also show that for 3D chips with interconnect reparability targets above 98% we reduce the area needed for spares and repair logic by up to 40%.	built-in self-test;cmos;computation;copper interconnect;electrical connection;image scaling;iterative method;run time (program lifecycle phase);stacking;through-silicon via	Michael Nicolaidis;Vladimir Pasca;Lorena Anghel	2012	2012 IEEE 18th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)	10.1109/IOLTS.2012.6313847	reliability engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;logic gate;engineering	EDA	21.303005335981467	54.04022248329104	3249

28d72d702eaa534dadfef625b093c69a89289c13	improvement of the two-way decode-and-forward scheme by energy harvesting and digital network coding relay		In this paper, we propose a two-way decode-and-forward scheme with an energy-harvesting relay in which the relay harvests energy from radio-frequency signals of source nodes by applying a power-splitting receiver and broadcasts coded signals using digital network coding (NCTW protocol). The system performance of the proposed NCTW protocol is compared with that of a conventional two-way decode-and-forward scheme without digital network coding (CTW protocol) and a two-way amplify-and-forward scheme with analogue network coding (TWAF protocol). Exact outage probability expressions are obtained to the NCTW and CTW protocols, whereas a lower bound expression is used to evaluate the TWAF protocol. The theoretical analyses are verified by Monte Carlo simulations. Evaluations show that (1) the proposed NCTW protocol outperforms the CTW and TWAF protocols; (2) the NCTW, CTW and TWAF protocols achieve the best performance when the power-splitting ratios converge to optimal values; (3) at the midpoint of two source nodes, the sum system performance of the NCTW and CTW protocols is the best, whereas that of the TWAF protocol is the worst; and finally, (4) the theoretical analyses of the NCTW and CTW protocols match well with the Monte Carlo simulation results, and the lower bound expression of the TWAF protocol converges to the exact results at the high signal-to-noise ratio.

For MMSE receivers, exact closed-form expressions for the ergodic sum-rate of the system are derived. In addition, simplified expressions are obtained for the key parameters dictating the sum-rate performance of the system in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime (i.e., high SNR slope and power offset) and low SNR regime (i.e., minimum energy per information bit required to convey any positive rate and the wideband slope). While for ZF receivers, tight closed-form upper and lower bounds for the ergodic sum-rate of the system are derived. It is analytically proven that the ZF and MMSE receivers achieve the same sum rate performance in the high SNR regime. Moreover, for both MMSE and ZF receivers, the achievable diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of Rayleigh-product MIMO channels is characterized. The findings suggest that a larger number of scatterers will improve the the performance of Rayleigh-product MIMO channels with linear receivers, and the ZF receivers achieve the same performance as the MMSE receivers in Rayleigh-product MIMO channels in the high SNR regime. Moreover, it is demonstrated that as long as the number of the scatterers is greater than the number of receive antennas, linear receivers achieve the optimal DMT.	digital monetary trust;ergodicity;mimo;multiplexing;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-noise ratio;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Caijun Zhong;Tharmalingam Ratnarajah;Zhaoyang Zhang;Kai-Kit Wong;Mathini Sellathurai	2014	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2014.031314.131478	telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;statistics;mimo;technology	Networks	38.62625920519852	75.00731800248396	3253

However, the design of a switch matrix for imaging applications is a complex task, particularly for a 2-D array because it depends mainly on the array topology, the number of channels, and the required performance. In this letter, a switch submatrix approach for a passive imaging system is presented and discussed. The goal is to reduce the complexity and the cost of the system architecture while maintaining its high performance. An optimization method that is able to yield optimal sparse arrays with a very low redundancy and an optimized switching process is then proposed. Numerical results confirm the efficiency of the proposed method. A good tradeoff between cost, performance, and system complexity is also reported.	mathematical optimization;numerical method;optimization problem;requirement;software release life cycle;sparse matrix;systems architecture;user requirements document	Yassine Aouial;Stephane Meric;Olivier Lafond;Mohamed Himdi	2012	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2012.2188493	telecommunications	HPC	60.780757539018	73.05368167013745	3260

The cooperative phase steering scheme is to make the received signals from multiple relay nodes co-phased at a destination node by pre-adjusting the phase differences.With a reasonable amount of feedback information from a destination node, the cooperative phase steering scheme circumvents the drawbacks of conventional cooperative diversity techniques such as maximal ratio combining (MRC) reception, maximal ratio transmission (MRT), and opportunistic relay selection schemes. Our analytical and simulation results show that the cooperative phase steering scheme outperforms the opportunistic relay selection scheme and approaches the MRT scheme known as a theoretically optimal cooperative diversity technique. It is also shown that cooperative phase steering has sufficient robustness to phase incoherence.	direction finding;downtime;maximal set;relay;simulation	Tae Won Ban;Wan Choi;Bang Chul Jung;Dan Keun Sung	2009	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/T-WC.2009.080038	radio repeater;probability density function;index term;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;cooperative diversity;radio receiver;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless	Mobile	37.8951490844711	79.56489551057054	3267

a569235d0a2edeaaf5017edec9de9d8e774473ee	blind recognition of space-time block code in miso system	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;communications engineering networks	Blind recognition of space-time block codes (STBCs) used in multiple transmitter communication is an important research topic in the non-cooperative scenario, which has attracted more and more attention recently. However, all of the current recognition algorithms can only work well in multiple-input multiple-output system, i.e., the system employs multiple receive antennas. To our knowledge, there is no report in the literature on blind recognition of STBCs in multiple-input single-output (MISO) system, i.e., the system employs only one receive antenna. In this paper, this matter is addressed. An original method of feature extraction for STBCs in the MISO system is proposed using the second-order and higher-order statistics of the reconstructed receiver. After feature extraction, the classification of space-time code can be considered as a pattern recognition problem. A classifier based on a support vector machine is proposed for the recognition of STBCs by mapping these features into a high dimensional space. Simulations show that the proposed classifier can recognize STBCs with high performance and be robust to modulation.		Guobing Qian;Liping Li;Minggang Luo;Hong Shu Liao;Hua Guo Zhang	2013	EURASIP J.

Thanks to the elementary lemma given by Mizoguchi and Souplet [Ann. Inst. H. Poincaré – AN 31 (2014), 851–875], we can derive a new type of entropy–energy estimate, which enables us to prove the following: (1) for N = 2, there exists a unique global classical solution to the full chemotaxis–Navier– Stokes system, which converges to a constant steady state (n∞, 0, 0) as t → +∞, and (2) for N = 3, the existence of a global weak solution to the simplified chemotaxis–Stokes system. Our results generalize the recent work due to Winkler [Commun. Partial Diff. Equ. 37 (2012), 319–351; Arch. Rational Mech. Anal. 211 (2014), 455–487], in which the domain Ω is essentially assumed to be convex.	comstock–needham system;convex function;farkas' lemma;navier–stokes equations;rational unified process;steady state	Jie Jiang;Hao Wu;Songmu Zheng	2015	Asymptotic Analysis	10.3233/ASY-141276	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;chemotaxis	ML	83.20749139534968	8.5708814349986	3297
5ba7a4bc13699fd12611d3c472e9545ff00bc3c8	improved direct power control of a doubly fed induction generator based wind energy conversion system		In this paper, we proposed a novel direct power control (DPC) strategy for a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) used in wind energy generation system (WECS). Basing on estimated rotor flux position and the errors of the active and reactive power, the switching vectors for rotor side converter were selected from the switching table. The proposed method used a rotor flux observer which deals with a low-pass filter algorithm (LPF). Finally, the proposed control and system performances are evaluated through simulation under Matlab-Simulink. The obtained results of a DFIG system illustrated the robustness and the efficiency of the proposed control method DPC during wind speed variations and indicated that the control strategy is efficient and leads to the best performances. Some experimental results are presented, in this paper, using a realtime system controller based on dSpace 1104.	control theory;dspace;deferred procedure call;low-pass filter;matlab;performance;peterson's algorithm;r.o.t.o.r.;real-time computing;simulation;simulink	Ameni Kadri;Hajer Marzougui;Khaoula Omrani;Faouzi Bacha	2018	2018 5th International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)	10.1109/CoDIT.2018.8394875	flux;wind power;control theory;power control;rotor (electric);wind speed;ac power;control theory;computer science;low-pass filter	Robotics	66.27486385248721	37.44795381617294	3304

With MCTRP, the emergency messages can be quickly disseminated with bounded delay, and the desired quality-of-service (QoS) for multimedia traffic can be provided with limited hardware requirement and signaling cost. In addition, MCTRP ensures that all nodes have an equal opportunity to transmit their data to achieve fairness. Through extensive simulations, it is demonstrated that MCTRP can effectively meet the requirements of IVC.	access time;fairness measure;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;quality of service;requirement;simulation;throughput;token ring;vehicle information and communication system	Yuanguo Bi;Kuang-Hao Liu;Xuemin Shen;Hai Zhao	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.167	token bus network;communications protocol;quality of service;token passing;mobile telephony;token ring;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Embedded	5.962644051468757	90.7046900319076	3311

The problem is to 1nd the nearest (for the Hamming distance) [n; k]-code from these words. We formalize an associated decision problem and prove it is NP-complete. We then adopt a more pragmatic point of view and consider generalities about detection and recognition problems. Algorithms based on dual codewords recognition are suggested which will be e5cient for codes of length up to 512 if the codewords contain no more than 1.5 errors on average and from which one could derive an algorithm to recognize the length, the dimension and the synchronisation of the code. c © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.	algorithm;binary symmetric channel;code word;decision problem;hamming distance;linear code;np-completeness;sensor	Antoine Valembois	2001	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/S0166-218X(00)00353-X	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;np-complete;decoding methods;linear code;mathematics;moment;algorithm	Theory	38.767659304039825	56.67178269919399	3313

Circuit correctness is tied to a rigorous set of context free grammar composition rules. These rules define how a small set of module symbols may be combined for circuits adhering to the design methodology. Schematic netlists are represented as graphs, and composition rules are defined as graph transformations akin to grammatical productions. Starting with a circuit netlist, a hierarchical parse tree that can demonstrate the wellformedness of the circuit is constructed. The procedure is hierarchical, incremental, and fast. GRASP operates one to two orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches.	cmos;circuit design;clock rate;computer program;context-free grammar;correctness (computer science);experiment;front and back ends;grasp;graph (discrete mathematics);graph rewriting;netlist;parse tree;parser;schematic;string (computer science);verification and validation;yacc	Cyrus Bamji;Jonathan Allen	1989	26th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference	10.1145/74382.74457	layout versus schematic;electronic engineering;logic synthesis;logic optimization;schematic capture;design methods;computer science;theoretical computer science;context-free grammar;programming language;tree;algorithm	EDA	16.063867297249324	47.72613638198545	3320

In this paper, we impose convexity on the cost function and anchoring of the equalizer away from the all-zero setup. We establish that there exists a globally convergent blind equalization strategy for 1D pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) systems with bounded input data (discrete or continuous) even when the equalizer is truncated. The resulting cost function is a constrained ZI norm of the joint impulse response of the channel and the equalizer. Our results apply to arbitrary linear channels (provided there are no unit circle zeros) and apply regardless of the initial IS1 (that is whether the eye is initially open or closed). We also show a globally convergent stochastic gradient scheme based on an implementable approximation of the ZI cost function.	approximation;blind equalization;equalization (communications);finite impulse response;local convergence;loss function;modulation;stochastic gradient descent	Sridhar Vembu;Sergio Verdú;Rodney A.

6f5b0e7c9f9611b8a2917a0d0eb1786fae270dc0	parallel huffman decoding: presenting a fast and scalable algorithm for increasingly multicore devices		Huffman encoding provides a simple approach for lossless compression of sequential data. The length of encoded symbols varies and these symbols are tightly packed in the compressed data. Thus, Huffman decoding is not easily par- allelisable. This is unfortunate since it is desirable to have a parallel algorithm which scales with the increased core count of modern systems. This paper presents a parallel approach for decoding Huffman codes which work by decoding from every location in the bit sequence then concurrently combining the results into the uncompressed sequence. Although requiring more operations than serial approaches the presented approach is able to produce results marginally faster, on sufficiently large data sets, then that of a simple serial implementation. This is achieved by using the large number of threads available on modern GPUs. A variety of implementations, primarily OpenCL, are presented to demonstrate the scaling of this algorithm on CPU and GPU hardware in response to cores available. As devices with more cores become available, the importance of such an algorithm will increase.	application programming interface;cuda;central processing unit;code;computation;data compression;embedded system;experiment;graphics processing unit;huffman coding;image scaling;lossless compression;memory bandwidth;multi-core processor;opencl api;overhead (computing);parallel algorithm;prefix sum;shared memory;streaming media;vii	Beau Johnston;Eric McCreath	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications and 2017 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing and Communications (ISPA/IUCC)	10.1109/ISPA/IUCC.2017.00146	huffman coding;decoding methods;scalability;algorithm;multi-core processor;uncompressed video;parallel algorithm;thread (computing);computer science;lossless compression	HPC	-0.14634350571653817	43.905820722686634	3325
ca7f538b02c727fbb05f433a1e5330119ce2a9c3	multiscale model reduction for transport and flow problems in perforated domains		Abstract Convection-dominated transport phenomenon is important for many applications. In these applications, the transport velocity is often a solution of heterogeneous flow problems, which results to a coupled flow and transport phenomena. In this paper, we consider a coupled flow (Stokes problem) and transport (unsteady convection–diffusion problem) in perforated domains. Perforated domains (see Fig. 1) represent void space outside hard inclusions as in porous media, filters, and so on. We construct a coarse-scale solver based on Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) for a coupled flow and transport. The main idea of the GMsFEM is to develop a systematic approach for computing multiscale basis functions. We use a mixed formulation and appropriate multiscale basis functions for both flow and transport to guarantee a mass conservation. For the transport problem, we use Petrov–Galerkin mixed formulation, which provides a stability. As a first approach, we use the multiscale flow solution in constructing the basis functions for the transport equation. In the second approach, we construct multiscale basis functions for coupled flow and transport without solving global flow problem. The novelty of this approach is to construct a coupled multiscale basis function. Numerical results are presented for computations using offline basis. We also present an algorithm for adaptively adding online multiscale basis functions, which are computed using the residual information. Numerical examples using online GMsFEM show the speed up of convergence.		Eric Lim Teik Chung;Wing Tat Leung;Maria Vasilyeva;Yating Wang	2018	J.

The problem of estimating this number in terms of the involved degrees is commonly called the weakened Hilbert’s 16th Problem. Recently, people have paid more attention to system (1). The following cases have been studied.	constant function;limit cycle	Shiyou Sui;Baoyi Li	2017	I. J.

We extend Stolarsky's invariance principle to this case and prove upper and lower bounds for numerical integration in the corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space.The idea of separating the direction from the distance from the origin can also be applied to the construction of quadrature methods. An extension of the area-preserving Lambert transform is used to generate points on S d - 1 via lifting Sobol' points in 0 , 1 ) d to the sphere. The d th component of each Sobol' point, suitably transformed, provides the distance information so that the resulting point set is normally distributed in R d .Numerical tests provide evidence of the usefulness of constructing Quasi-Monte Carlo type methods for integration in such spaces.

Using this model, we have investigated the frequency response of GNR as a function of temperature for 16nm technology node. The effective mean free path (MFP) is calculated for different temperature and then the resistance of GNR interconnect is calculated. It is observed that for different interconnect length and for three different temperature (233K, 300K and 378K), the performance of GNR interconnect is almost consistent for a wide range of frequencies. Our analysis shows that GNR can operate up to 1000 THz frequency.	equivalent circuit;frequency response;graphene;profiling (computer programming);radio frequency;semiconductor device fabrication;simulation	Waikhom Mona Chanu;Vikash Prasad;Debaprasad Das	2016	2016 20th International Symposium on VLSI Design and Test (VDAT)	10.1109/ISVDAT.2016.8064864	electronic engineering;frequency response;graphene;radio frequency;computer science;terahertz radiation;mean free path;scattering	Arch	70.80596852712422	47.68116741932958	3374

Multiple antenna communication at millimeter wavelengths is a promising technology for both backhaul and access within these networks. We discuss a dual-polarized channel model for an outdoor, millimeter wave system and propose a beam-alignment algorithm that exploits the orthogonal polarizations. The proposed beam-alignment algorithm reduces the beam search time by sounding the orthogonal polarizations in parallel. Moreover, noise and interference immunity is improved with a joint search method. The proposed beam-alignment algorithm enables closed-loop multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication for either backhaul or access scenarios.	algorithm;automatic sounding;backhaul (telecommunications);beam search;beamforming;bose wave system;channel (communications);data rate units;diplexer;fifth generation computer;interference (communication);mimo;polarization (waves)	Jiho Song;Stephen G.

Experience has shown that block-oriented symmetric product ciphers constitute an adequate design paradigm for resolving this task, since they can offer a very high level of security as well as very high encryption rates. In this contribution we introduce a new product cipher which encrypts large blocks of plaintext by repeated intertwined application of substitution and permutation operations. While almost all of the current product ciphers use fixed (predefined) permutation operations on small data blocks, our approach involves parametrizable (keyed) permutations on large data blocks (whole images) induced by specific chaotic systems (Kolmogorov flows). By combining these highly unstable dynamics with an adaption of a very fast shift register based pseudo-random number generator, we obtain a new class of computationally secure product ciphers which offer many features that make them superior to contemporary bulk encryption systems when aiming at efficient image and video data encryption. © 1998 SPIE and IS&T.	encryption	Josef Scharinger	1998	J.

16e1a676e9b1ddf7f6766883a16f64f8baa021d3	reduction of the feature space for the detection of attacks of wireles sensor networks		The article evaluates the informativeness of the features of the abnormal behaviour of node in wireless sensor network. The estimation is carried out for the basic methods of attacking on wireless sensor networks, such as ≪funnel≫, ≪wormhole≫, ≪selective forwarding≫, etc. The estimation is performed using three basic methods: the method of Shannon, the method of Kullback and the method of accumulated frequencies. Special attention is paid to the dependence of the feature informativeness on various characteristics of the network (topology, packet generation periods, the degree of stochasticity of the selection of addresses for the generated packets transmission). Estimates are compared with previously obtained estimates for the simplest network with the mesh topology. Key results are the reduction of the feature space by uninformative features extracting (when reducing the introduced scale of feature informativeness degree is used), the formation of samples with estimates of informativeness for each network and each pair ≪normal behaviour≫-≪specific attack type≫. Also the program for automatic calculation of estimates of the informativeness and its subsequent analysis is created. In the future the obtained results can be used as the basis for methods of classification, aimed at identifying of anomalous behaviour in wireless sensor networks.	feature vector;mesh networking;network packet;network topology;shannon (unit)	Victoria M.

In this paper, we propose a coalition formation framework for interference management in VLC networks. VLC access points (APs) are designed to self-organize into cooperation coalitions for interference cancellation through orthogonal time or frequency domain. The performances of VLC APs with and without forming coalitions are both analyzed. Based on coalition formation game theory, a simple merge-and-split algorithm based on Pareto order is proposed. The convergence, stability, and complexity of the proposed algorithm are further discussed. Numerical results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.	algorithm;confidentiality;game theory;interference (communication);numerical method;pareto efficiency;performance;self-organization;vlc media player;wireless access point	Li Chen;Weidong Wang;Chi Zhang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2660495	game theory;single antenna interference cancellation;electronic engineering;frequency domain;computer network;visible light communication;wireless;computer science;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;open spectrum;convergence (routing)	Mobile	36.26093942928209	92.38425333348285	3399

We show that the determinant of the FIM is a supermodular function from which it follows that the Lagrangian bound can be computed in polynomial time. We note that the continuous relaxation of the sensor subset selection problem can be transformed to a convex optimization problem from which it follows that the continuous bound is also computable in polynomial time. We also point to the benefit of using the natural selection process to solve the continuous relaxation of a variation of the sensor subset selection problem where sensors are allowed to make more than one measurement.	combinatorial optimization;computable function;convex optimization;fisher information;formation matrix;lagrange multiplier;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;polynomial;selection algorithm;sensor;supermodular function;time complexity	Farhad Ghassemi;Vikram Krishnamurthy	2009	2009 12th International Conference on Information Fusion		optimization problem;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;lagrangian relaxation;mathematics;subset sum problem	Robotics	48.31126780392002	5.472245780288076	3403

Traditionally analog computers have computed ordinary differential equations of time, but analog field computation permits massively parallel temporal integration of partial differential equations. In principle many different physical media – not just electronics – can be exploited to implement the basic operations of analog computing, a small number of which are sufficient to approximate a wide variety of analog computations, thus providing a basis for universal analog computation and general-purpose analog computers. The contentious issue of the computational power of analog computers is addressed best on its own terms, rather by asking it within the context of Church-Turing computation, which distorts the relevant questions and their answers.	analog computer;approximation algorithm;artificial intelligence;book;church–turing thesis;computation;computer science;distortion;general-purpose markup language;model of computation;moore's law;parallel computing;software engineer;turing	Bruce J.

574f39a44959e78452bd56c6d33e6c69a2287bdb	the weak convergence of tcp bandwidth sharing		TCP is the dominating transmission protocol in the Internet since decades. It proved its flexibility to adapt to unknown and changing network conditions. A distinguished TCP feature is the comparably fair resource sharing. Unfortunately, this abstract fairness is frequently misinterpreted as convergence towards equal sharing rates. In this paper we show in theory as well as in experiment that TCP rate convergence does not exist. Instead, the individual TCP flow rate is persistently fluctuating over a range close to one order of magnitude. The fluctuations are not short term but correlated over long intervals, so that the carried data volume converges rather slowly. The weak convergence does not negate fairness in general. Nevertheless, a particular transmission operation could deviate considerably.	bandwidth (signal processing);bottleneck (engineering);converge;experiment;fairness measure;interval arithmetic;network congestion;network switch;randomness;sawtooth (cellular automaton);sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation;starvation (computer science);testbed	Wolfram Lautenschlaeger	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-31559-1_13	tcp global synchronization;cubic tcp;hstcp;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;dynamic bandwidth allocation	Networks	-3.4328904530430924	92.91276758311749	3425
1a5df4dcc4d019243f651e3b8e9aae73ebc42660	high order integration factor methods for systems with inhomogeneous boundary conditions		Abstract Due to the high order spatial derivatives and stiff reactions, severe temporal stability constraints on the time step are generally required when developing numerical methods for solving high order partial differential equations. Implicit integration method (IIF) method along with its compact form (cIIF), which treats spatial derivatives exactly and reaction terms implicitly, provides excellent stability properties with good efficiency by decoupling the treatment of reaction and spatial derivatives. One major challenge for IIF is storage and calculation of the potential dense exponential matrices of the sparse discretization matrices resulted from the linear differential operators. The compact representation for IIF (cIIF) was introduced to save the computational cost and storage for this purpose. Another challenge is finding the matrix of high order space discretization, especially near the boundaries. In this paper, we extend IIF method to high order discretization for spatial derivatives through an example of reaction diffusion equation with fourth order accuracy, while the computational cost and storage are similar to the general second order cIIF method. The method can also be efficiently applied to deal with other types of partial differential equations with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous boundary conditions. Direct numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the approach.		Sameed Ahmed;Xinfeng Liu	2019	J.

For this purpose, the knowledge of the complete forward solution may be required. Similar information is needed in the context of a posteriori error estimation with respect to a given functional. In the area of flow control, especially for three dimensional problems, it is usually impossible to keep track of the full forward solution due to the lack of storage capacities. Further, for many problems, adaptive time-stepping procedures are needed toward efficient integration schemes in time. Therefore, standard optimal offline checkpointing strategies are usually not well suited in that framework. In this paper we present two algorithms for an online checkpointing procedure that determines the checkpoint distribution on the fly. We prove that these approaches yield checkpointing distributions that are either optimal or almost optimal with only a small gap to optimality.

It employs minimum phase conditions reported in , and extends the same to SIDO boost converter to eliminate the effect of RHP zero. Further, the proposed work employs input-output linearization technique , to linearize the control-to-output transfer function across different operating points to achieve improved stability under unbalanced loads and a wide output voltage range on each output of the proposed SIDO boost power converter. The SIDO boost regulator was verified experimentally for an input voltage of 3.3 V and a maximum simultaneous load current of 350 mA on each output. Measurement results demonstrate that the proposed design achieves a wide output voltage range of 4.8 V-13.75 V, with ability to dynamically transition across these different output voltages in both small and big voltage steps.	boost converter;dynamic voltage scaling;electric power conversion;experiment;image scaling;minimum phase;power management;transfer function;unbalanced circuit	Sujan K.

3123c9352bb7013d6e280c3dd9faefc787a6ca80	design of sparse filters by a discrete filled function technique		In this paper, we consider the sparse filter design problem where some of the coefficients can be reduced to zeroes in order to lower implementation complexity. The objective is to choose the fewest number of nonzero filter coefficients to meet a given performance requirement. We formulate a discrete optimization problem to minimize the number of nonzero terms and develop a discrete search method to find the minimal nonzero terms. In each step, we need to consider a subproblem to design the filter coefficients with a given set of nonzero terms. We formulate this subproblem as a linear programming problem and apply an exchange algorithm to find the optimal coefficients. For illustration, we compare the proposed algorithm with existing methods and show that the proposed method gives better results in all our test cases.	sparse	Zhi Guo Feng;Ka Fai Cedric Yiu;Soon Yi Wu	2018	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-018-0758-z	mathematical optimization;test case;mathematics;discrete optimization;filter design;linear programming	Vision	64.61922104891023	17.17486925497864	3448

The resulting network can improve the original torus network by reducing the network diameter, node-to-node distances, and by increasing the bisection width without increasing wiring and other engineering complexity. We present and analyze the statement that a 3D iBT network proposed by our technique outperforms 4D torus networks of the same node degree. We found that interlacing rings of sizes 6 and 12 to all three dimensions of a torus network with meshes 30 × 30 × 36 generate the best network of all possible networks, including 4D torus and hypercube of approximately 32,000 nodes. This demonstrates that strategically interlacing bypass rings into a 3D torus network enhances the torus network more effectively than adding a fourth dimension, although we may generalize the claim. We also present a node-to-node distance formula for the iBT networks.	interlaced video;interlacing (bitmaps);routing;wiring	Peng Zhang;Reid Powell;Yuefan Deng	2011	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2010.89	routing;grid network;parallel computing;computer science;distributed computing;network topology;hypercube;computer network	HPC	0.047520861384959714	68.8980137250266	3449

Moreover, the problem is NP-complete for H-free subcubic graphs whenever H contains a connected component which is not a tree with at most 3 leaves. We show that if every connected component of H is a tree with at most 3 leaves and at most 7 vertices, then the problem can be solved for H-free subcubic graphs in polynomial time.	algorithm;connected component (graph theory);degree (graph theory);independent set (graph theory);np-completeness;p versus np problem;polynomial;random graph;time complexity	Vadim V.

As in ordinary MKP, by w j and p j we denote the weight and profit of item j ∈ N respectively, and the capacity of knapsack i ∈ M is ci. However, a fixed cost fi is imposed if we use knapsack i, and knapsacks are freely available within a fixed budget B. The problem is to determine the set of knapsacks to be employed as well as to fill the adopted knapsacks with items such that the capacity constraints are all satisfied and the total profit is maximized. Let yi and xi j be the decision variables such that yi = 1 if we use knapsack i, and yi = 0 otherwise. Also, xi j = 1 if item j is put into knapsack i, and xi j = 0 otherwise. Then, the problem is formulated as the following budget-constrained multiple knapsack problem.

While the Linear Time-Cost Tradeoff Problem can be solved in polynomial time, its discrete variant is known to be NP-hard. We present the first approximation algorithms for the Discrete Time-Cost Tradeoff Problem. Specifically, given a fixed budget we consider the problem of finding a shortest schedule for a project. We give an approximation algorithm with performance ratio 3/2 for the class of projects where all feasible durations of activities are either 0, 1, or 2. We extend our result by giving approximation algorithms with performance guarantee Olog l, where l is the ratio of the maximum duration of any activity to the minimum nonzero duration of any activity. Finally, we discuss bicriteria approximation algorithms which compute schedules for a given deadline or budget such that both project duration and cost are within a constant factor of the duration and cost of an optimum schedule for the given deadline or budget.	approximation algorithm	Martin Skutella	1997		10.1287/moor.23.4.909	partition;time complexity;minimisation;mathematical optimization;discrete time and continuous time;project;graph theory;discrete system;calculus;relaxation;mathematics;computational complexity theory;scheduling;approximation algorithm;algorithm	ML	17.749381195317135	10.74059550239328	3469

c9001fef2e36db79234fd6792af2e23652e3ea17	novel transmit antenna selection strategy for massive mimo downlink channel	massive mimo;antenna selection;channel state information;fdd;greedy algorithm	In this paper, we deal with the problem of acquiring the channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter in large-scale multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems, so-called massive MIMO systems. Clearly, obtaining CSI plays a central role to provide high system performance. Even though, in frequency-division duplexed systems, acquiring this information requires a prohibitive amount of feedback, since it increases with the number of transmit antenna. In this work, we design an efficient transmit antenna selection strategy aware of the amount of required CSI for a point-to-multipoint transmission in massive MIMO systems. The proposed strategy provides high sum-rate with limited CSI feedback and limited computational complexity. Innovatively, the antenna selection in our strategy is performed in a decentralized fashion successively at the receiving users. Two schemes are proposed in this work to perform the antenna selection at each user. Next, taking into consideration that the large-scale MIMO transmitter suffers from imperfect knowledge of CSI, we design a new performance criterion. Computer simulations validate that, when the CSI is perfectly known, the proposed strategy is able to achieve high performance in terms of system sum-rate while a significant reduction in both CSI feedback overhead and computational complexity is observed. Moreover, assuming imperfect CSI, the new proposed criterion achieves higher performance when the estimation accuracy is low and at high SNR regime.	mimo;telecommunications link	Mouncef Benmimoune;Elmahdi Driouch;Wessam Ajib;Daniel Massicotte	2017	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-016-1297-9	3g mimo;mimo;channel state information;electronic engineering;computational complexity theory;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;transmitter;distributed computing;greedy algorithm;communication channel	Mobile	39.637505103149955	86.69678187699621	3475

However, communication systems, including cellular networks, were usually crashed due to various causes making the coordination among a large number of disorganized disaster response workers extremely difficult. Survival rate can be greatly increased by breaking the communication bottleneck. Based on our firsthand experience in 921 Chi-Chi Earthquake and extensive research, we synthesize a set of requirements for deploying an emergency communication network for disaster response (ECN-DR), which can be deployed and operated under extreme environment and unusually communication behaviors in disaster areas. There are seven challenges, called 7-ability, that have to be addressed when designing an ECN-DR. 7-ability includes popularity, usability, practicability, capacity, reliability, operability and adaptability. Popularity and usability are used to fulfill end-user requirements. Practicability, capacity, reliability, operability and adaptability are used to fulfill operator requirements. Finally, we propose high level system architecture of ECN-DR. Several research issues about how 7-ability can be achieved will be presented.	chi;chaos theory;dr-dos;earthquake network;explicit congestion notification;high-level programming language;operability;requirement;systems architecture;telecommunications network;usability;user requirements document	Jyh-Shyan Huang;Yao-Nan Lien	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems (ICCS)	10.1109/ICCS.2012.6406204	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer security;emergency management;computer network	Robotics	3.156306849810912	72.21020925982378	3485

On the other hand, multilevel converters have become a mature technology mainly in medium- and high-power applications. One of the problems of multilevel converters is the dc voltage unbalance of the dc bus. Depending on the loading conditions and the number of levels of the converter, oscillations appear in the dc voltages of the dc link. This paper presents a feedforward modulation technique for multilevel multiphase converters that reduces the distortion under balanced or unbalanced dc conditions. The proposed modulation method can be applied to any multilevel-converter topology with any number of levels and phases. Experimental results are shown in order to validate the proposed feedforward modulation technique.	analog-to-digital converter;computation;computational complexity theory;distortion;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;modulation;online and offline;unbalanced circuit	Jose Ignacio León Galván;Óscar Lopez;Leopoldo García Franquelo;Jes&#x00FA;s Doval-Gandoy;Sergio Vazquez;Jacobo Álvarez;Francisco D.

They are locally exact, i.e., they preserve the linearization of the original system at every point. Their construction consists in modifying existing numerical schemes in order to make them locally exact. The resulting schemes preserve all fixed points and are A-stable. The most promising results concern the discrete gradient method (modified implicit midpoint rule) where we succeeded to preserve essential geometric properties and the final results have a relatively simple form. In the case of one-dimensional Hamiltonian systems numerical experiments show that our modifications can increase the accuracy by several orders of magnitude. The main result of this paper is the construction of energy-preserving locally exact discrete gradient schemes for arbitrary multidimensional Hamiltonian systems in canonical coordinates.	numerical analysis	Jan L.

e5e11106cca0662cd6384fde64cc2bd186e4f68d	distributed real-time shortest-paths computations with the field calculus		As the density of sensing/computation/actuation nodes is increasing, it becomes more and more feasible and useful to think at an entire network of physical devices as a single, continuous space-time computing machine. The emergent behaviour of the whole software system is then induced by local computations deployed within each node and by the dynamics of the information diffusion. A relevant example of this distribution model is given by aggregate computing and its companion language field calculus, a minimal set of purely functional constructs used to manipulate distributed data structures evolving over space and time, and resulting in robustness to changes. In this paper, we study the convergence time of an archetypal and widely used component of distributed computations expressed in field calculus, called gradient: a fully-distributed estimation of distances over a metric space by a spanning tree. We provide an analytic result linking the quality of the output of a gradient to the amount of computing resources dedicated. The resulting error bounds are then exploited for network design, suggesting an optimal density value taking broadcast interferences into account. Finally, an empirical evaluation is performed validating the theoretical results.

We consider a multirate WLAN with access point (AP), where there may be both elastic and inelastic traffic flows. Through our algorithm and leveraging previous theoretical results, the AP can estimate: (i) the available bandwidth that a new station wishing to associate with the AP can use, (ii) the impact on the system performance of admitting the new station, (iii) the bandwidth still available (if any) for inelastic traffic. The above quantities can be effectively used for admission control in WLANs and load balancing among APs with overlapping coverages. Indeed, simulation results show that the estimates yielded by our algorithm accurately reflect the system throughput behavior when there are both elastic and inelastic flows, in the uplink and downlink directions.	algorithm;autonomous robot;bandwidth (signal processing);bandwidth management;computation;load balancing (computing);real-time clock;simulation;stepping level;telecommunications link;throughput;wireless access point	Claudio Rossi;Claudio Casetti;Carla-Fabiana Chiasserini	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6133774	payload;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;load balancing;wireless network;traffic flow;computer performance;bandwidth;measurement;statistics;computer network	Embedded	2.1349164085317978	96.98906460107997	3499

The correction term is derived from an approximation of the difference between the exact solution of stochastic differential equations and the Euler-Maruyama's continuous-time extension. The method is proved to be mean-square convergent with order 1 2 and is as easy to implement as standard explicit schemes but much more efficient for solving stiff stochastic problems. For a linear scalar test equation with a scalar noise term, it is shown that the mean-square stability domain of the method is much bigger than that of the Euler-Maruyama method. It is proved the method preserves the mean-square stability and asymptotic stability of the linear scalar equation without any constraint on the numerical step size. Finally, numerical examples are reported to show the accuracy and effectiveness of the method.	euler;euler–maruyama method	Zhengwei Yin;Siqing Gan	2015	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2015.01.067	l-stability;mathematical optimization;backward euler method;mathematical analysis;calculus;control theory;mathematics;exponential stability;numerical stability	ML	86.38554140833196	16.222685968863047	3501

By comparing these to the unit cost of obtaining the parent of a node with an explicit parent-pointer field, it is possible to balance runtime and storage cost with respect to the task of finding parent nodes in binary trees. The results obtained show that, although the worst case complexity for ann-node tree is obviouslyO(n) for all three algorithms, the average case complexity for two input distributions is asymptotic (from below) to either 3 or 2.	recursion (computer science)	Keith Brinck	1986	BIT		random binary tree;left-child right-sibling binary tree;recurrence relation;binary expression tree;exponential tree;data structure;binary tree;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;mathematics;ternary tree;threaded binary tree;algorithm	Theory	15.576433336556189	29.26942989315991	3506
464313d8030b32dfa125cb3d442cb7013723674e	channel prediction techniques for a multi-user mimo system in time-varying environments		Although multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems provide high data rate transmission, they may suffer from interference. Block diagonalization and eigenbeam-space division multiplexing (E-SDM) can suppress interference. The transmitter needs to determine beamforming weights from channel state information (CSI) to use these techniques. However, MIMO channels change in time-varying environments during the time intervals between when transmission parameters are determined and actual MIMO transmission occurs. The outdated CSI causes interference and seriously degrades the quality of transmission. Channel prediction schemes have been developed to mitigate the effects of outdated CSI. We evaluated the accuracy of prediction of autoregressive (AR)-model-based prediction and Lagrange extrapolation in the presence of channel estimation error. We found that Lagrange extrapolation was easy to implement and that it provided performance comparable to that obtained with the AR-model-based technique. key words: channel prediction, multi-user MIMO system, block diagonalization, eigenbeam-space division multiplexing, time-varying environments, AR model, lagrange extrapolation	autoregressive model;beamforming;channel state information;data rate units;extrapolation;interference (communication);lagrange multiplier;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;propagation constant;transmitter	Kanako Yamaguchi;Huu Phu Bui;Yasutaka Ogawa;Toshihiko Nishimura;Takeo Ohgane	2014	IEICE Transactions		3g mimo;telecommunications;control theory;autoregressive model;statistics	Networks	42.277161458522535	83.2740102297798	3511

In WRP, routing nodes communicate the distance and second-to-last hop for each destination. WRP reduces the number of cases in which a temporary routing loop can occur, which accounts for its fast convergence properties. A detailed proof of correctness is presented and its performance is compared by simulation with the performance of the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm (DBF), DUAL (a loop-free distance-vector algorithm) and an ideal link-state algorithm (ILS), which represent the state of the art of internet routing. The simulation results indicate that WRP is the most eecient of the alternatives analyzed. The routing protocols used in multihop packet-radio networks implemented in the past 2, 3, 11] were based on shortest-path routing algorithms that have been typically based on the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm (DBF) 4]. According to DBF, a routing node knows the length of the shortest path from each neighbor to every network destination and this information is used to compute the shortest path and successor in the path to each destination. An update message contains a vector of one or more entries, each of which speciies as a minimum, the distance to a given destination. A major performance problem with DBF is that it takes a very long time to update the routing tables of network nodes after network partitions, node failures, or increase in network congestion. This performance problem of DBF stems from the fact that it has no inherent mechanism to determine when a network node should stop incrementing its distance to a given destination. This problem is usually called the counting-to-innnity problem.

The objective is to determine the optimal due-date and schedule simultaneously to minimize the total of due-date, earliness and tardiness penalties. We give a concise analysis of the problem and provide a polynomial time algorithm to solve the problem. Moreover, the algorithm can be easily applied to the ‘mirror’ scheduling problem in which the actual processing time of a job is a decreasing function of its starting time.	job stream;scheduling (computing);single-machine scheduling	W.-H.

To extend its applicability to simple rectangle packings, this paper addresses the problem of handling abutment constraints in the context of the CBL representation. We can obtain the abutment information by scanning the intermediate solutions represented by CBL in linear time during the simulated annealing process and fix the CBL by the heuristic method in case the constraints are violated. A novel penalty function is derived to measure the violation of the abutment constraints and help to ensure all the constraints are satisfied at the end of the annealing process. The experimental results are demonstrated by several examples of MCNC benchmarks and the performance shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.	floorplan (microelectronics)	Yuchun Ma;Xianlong Hong;Sheqin Dong;Yici Cai;Chung-Kuan Cheng;Jun Gu	2001	Integration	10.1016/S0167-9260(01)00022-0	embedded system;simulated annealing;computer science;artificial intelligence;computer aided design;mathematics;engineering drawing;algorithm	Vision	16.285235049061967	50.201413839362104	3515

Our approach optimizes the communication cost of the design. This aim can be reached by minimizing the transfer of data required between design partitions and the routing cost between FPGA modules. Consequently, our algorithm is composed by two main steps. The first step aims to find a temporal partitioning of the graph. This step gives the optimal solution in term of communication cost. Next, our approach builds the best architecture, on a partially reconfigurable FPGA, that gives the lowest routing cost between modules. The proposed methodology was tested on several examples on the Xilinx Virtex-II pro. The results show significant reduction in the communication cost compared with others famous approaches used in this field.

Firstly, we consider a special scenario with two source-destination pairs. For this network, there are two possible strategies in each hop: no-cooperation or cooperation. Considering the combination of the two strategies in two cascaded hops, we investigate four different end-to-end transmission strategies, and we find that the four strategies complement one another depending on channel conditions in terms of outage performance. To maximize the mutual information, we propose an optimum joint selection of source-destination pair and end-to-end transmission strategy. Then we show that the optimum joint selection scheme can be simplified without loss of outage performance, and derive its exact outage probability in closed-form. Secondly, we generalize the proposed transmission strategy into a scenario with multiple source-destination pairs. For this network, we first propose an optimum end-to-end transmission strategy to maximize the mutual information, then a suboptimum end-to-end transmission strategy to reduce the signaling overhead and computational complexity. For the suboptimum strategy, we derive the outage probability and diversity order.	computational complexity theory;downtime;end-to-end principle;mutual information;overhead (computing);relay	Min-Chul Ju;Il-Min Kim;Dong In Kim	2010	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2010.100110.100307	communications protocol;additive white gaussian noise;telecommunications;computer science;knowledge engineering;probability;mathematics;cooperative diversity;mutual information;computational complexity theory;statistics;computer network	Mobile	34.6339525692037	77.423714622446	3525

Designing LC VCO circuit with desired specifications is highly time consuming and tedious job. In this paper CMODE (Combining Multi objective Optimization with Differential Evolution) optimization technique is used to design an LC VCO of optimal FOM with a target frequency of 2.5 GHz. The design parameters of LC VCO are obtained from the CMODE algorithm used in the MATLAB environment to optimize FOM. By using these parameters the LC VCO circuit is designed and synthesized in 90 nm CMOS technology in the Cadence Spectre Analog Design Environment(ADE). This VCO achieves phase noise of -119.7 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset while consuming 515 uW power with a tuning range of 10.53%. The FOM is obtained to be -190.26 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset. Hence the best performance index meeting the desired specifications is obtained in a single run of the algorithm.	algorithm;cmos;differential evolution;matlab;mathematical optimization;phase noise;program optimization;voltage-controlled oscillator	Pravat K.

The theoretical models are based on expressions for the excess mean-square error (EMSE) and cross-EMSE of the component filters, which allows their application to different combinations of algorithms, such as least mean-squares (LMS), normalized LMS (NLMS), and constant modulus algorithm (CMA), considering white or colored inputs and stationary or nonstationary environments. Since the desired universal behavior of the combination depends on the correct estimation of the mixing parameter at every instant, its adaptation is also taken into account in the transient analysis. Furthermore, we propose normalized algorithms for the adaptation of the mixing parameter that exhibit good performance. Good agreement between analysis and simulation results is always observed.	adaptive filter;approximation algorithm;cma-es;emoticon;least mean squares filter;loss function;mean squared error;modulus of continuity;noise (electronics);noise power;offset binary;simulation;stationary process;steady state;transient state	Renato Candido;Magno T.

In Sensor-MAC (S-MAC), one of the first MAC protocols designed for sensor networks, nodes sleep and wake up periodically to save energy. MAC protocols such as Timeout-MAC (T-MAC) and Advertisement-MAC (ADV-MAC) improved upon S-MAC by introducing support for variable loads and providing further energy savings. In event-driven networks with sources generating bursty traffic or networks with period traffic, we can further reduce the energy consumption and increase node lifetime if we take into account the nature of the traffic. In this paper we propose Advertisement-based Time-division Multiple Access, or ATMA, a distributed TDMA-based MAC protocol for wireless sensor networks that utilizes the bursty or periodic nature of the traffic to prevent energy waste through advertisements and reservations for data slots. We provide detailed comparisons of the ATMA protocol with S-MAC, T-MAC and ADV-MAC through extensive simulations. The simulation results show that in bursty or periodic traffics, ATMA outperforms S-MAC, T-MAC and ADV-MAC in terms of energy consumption with reductions of up to 75%, while faring as well as T-MAC and ADV-MAC in terms of packet delivery ratio and latency.	design review (u.s. government);event-driven programming;mac address;network packet;performance;simulation	Surjya Sarathi Ray;Ilker Demirkol;Wendi B.

01068d826eda00ba36be2128ee990945c43a0c64	on shortening the effective mmwave mimo channel impulse response		mmWave communication typically resorts to beamforming in order to overcome the unfavorable propagation conditions in the high frequency bands. The directional transmission established using beamforming is beneficial also in terms of reducing the effective channel impulse response (CIR) and, correspondingly, the required guard periods in a block transmission scheme. While this effect has been investigated in the literature for the single stream case, in this paper we analyse the shortening of the effective multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) channel impulse response in a mmWave multistream transmission. It is shown that even though the complete effective MIMO channel impulse response might be relatively long, smart time delaying of streams sent over different physical paths can exploit the sparsity of the mmWave channel in the temporal-angular domain, and result in significant CIR shortening. In this way, guard period reduction can be achieved, with the overhead approaching that of the single stream case.	angularjs;beamforming;camera serial interface;channel state information;committed information rate;frequency band;mimo;overhead (computing);semiconductor industry;software propagation;sparse matrix	Nikola Vucic;Marcin Iwanow;Mario H.

Stochastic game (SG), together with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), offers a systematic framework for the study of information warfare in current and emerging cyber-physical systems. In practical security games, each player usually has only incomplete information about the opponent, which induces information asymmetry. This paper exploits information asymmetry from a new angle, considering how to exploit information unknown to the opponent to the player's advantage. Two new MARL algorithms, termed minimax post-decision state (minimax-PDS) and Win-or-Learn Fast post-decision state (WoLF-PDS), are proposed, which enable the LS to learn and adapt faster in dynamic environments by exploiting its information advantage. The proposed algorithms are provably convergent and rational, respectively. Also, numerical results are presented to show their effectiveness through three important applications.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;cyber-physical system;interaction;minimax;multi-agent system;numerical analysis;reinforcement learning;suicidegirls	Xiaofan He;Huaiyu Dai;Peng Ning	2016	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2016.2548987	games;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;information security;cyber-physical system;computer security;energy harvesting	ML	34.73630822027666	96.58007405216718	3554

The algorithms provide a tradeoff between complexity and decoding capability. Whereas the running time of the q-ary belief-propagation algorithms is m2m times that of its binary counterpart, in our case the complexity factor can be chosen between m and 2m, depending on the error-correction capability required. As such, the running time can be much better than the q-ary belief-propagation algorithm. The main idea behind our algorithm is to apply an appropriate set of GF(2)-linear forms of GF(q) to the Raptor code to obtain a set of binary codes which can be decoded independently in parallel. After a prescribed number of iterations, for each of the input symbols of the Raptor code and each of the linear forms an estimate is obtained on the probability that this linear form applied to the input symbol is zero. By gathering these probabilities and performing a maximum-likelihood decoding on a suitable code of very small blocklength, we are able to obtain a good estimate of the value of the input symbol. Simulations results are provided for a families of q-ary symmetric channels and non-symmetric channels which show the performance of our decoding algorithms.	algorithm;alphabet (formal languages);belief propagation;binary code;computer simulation;data compression;decoding methods;error detection and correction;iteration;linear code;raptor code;software propagation;standard streams;time complexity;whole earth 'lectronic link	Harm S.

Each supplier provides components of a specified family, which are assembled at a corresponding workstation. Units belonging to different models of products are sequentially fed onto the conveyor, and pass through the workstations to generate finished products. Each storehouse stores finished products belonging to a specific model for satisfying customer demands. The suppliers deliver components according to a just-in-time supply policy with stochastic leadtimes. Customer demands for a particular model of products arrive at the corresponding storehouse according to a Poisson stream. The paper conducts a modeling and performance analysis in the design stage of the system in the sense of ‘‘long-term-behavior’’. A rolling technique is constructed for analyzing stationary probability distributions of the numbers of components. A two-dimensional Markov chain with infinite states is introduced for analyzing stationary probability distributions of inventories of finished products. Based on these distributions, performance measures of the system, such as work-in-process of components, inventory amounts of finished products, as well as service levels for customers, can be easily obtained.

Nevertheless, there are no general statements as to whether the linearity of the Bayesian estimator is restricted to the Gaussian case. The two common strategies for non-Gaussian models are either finding the best linear estimator or numerically evaluating the Bayesian estimator by Monte Carlo methods. In this paper, we focus on Bayesian interpolation of non-Gaussian first-order autoregressive (AR) processes where the driving innovation can admit any symmetric infinitely divisible distribution characterized by the Lévy-Khintchine representation theorem. We redefine the Bayesian estimation problem in the Fourier domain with the help of characteristic forms. By providing analytic expressions, we show that the optimal interpolator is linear for all symmetric -stable distributions. The Bayesian interpolator can be expressed in a convolutive form where the kernel is described in terms of exponential splines. We also show that the limiting case of Lévy-type AR(1) processes, the system of which has a pole at the origin, always corresponds to a linear Bayesian interpolator made of a piecewise linear spline, irrespective of the innovation distribution. Finally, we show the two mentioned cases to be the only ones within the family for which the Bayesian interpolator is linear.	autoregressive model;first-order reduction;infinite divisibility;interpolation;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;piecewise linear continuation;spline (mathematics);time complexity	Arash Amini;Philippe Thévenaz;John Paul Ward;Michael Unser	2013	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2013.2258371	ornstein–uhlenbeck process;econometrics;mathematical optimization;interpolation;bayesian multivariate linear regression;signal processing;gaussian process;conjugate prior;mathematics;bayesian linear regression;fourier analysis;autoregressive model;bayesian statistics;statistics;monte carlo method	ML	52.561753095188	14.629275530927456	3568

However, DHT-based overlays are often largely oblivious to the underlying physical network and only assign second-rate effort to the exploitation of physical proximity. Hence, a single overlay hop often amounts to an unnecessarily large number of physical hops. While this might at best be considered inefficient in stationary networks, it could prove disastrous in mobile (and wireless) networks, thus, effectively limiting the deployability of P2P overlays on top of mobile and wireless networks. We present an approach that forms clusters in DHT-based P2P overlays based on physical proximity. By grouping physically close nodes into common overlay clusters, we can decrease the number of physical hops per overlay hop. Thus, the amount of physical traffic generated by overlays deployed on top of mobile and wireless ad-hoc networks can be reduced significantly.	cluster analysis;distributed hash table;hoc (programming language);overlay network;peer-to-peer;stationary process	Thomas Zahn;Rolf Winter;Jochen H.

To enhance the selection of channel with less noise among the white spaces (idle channels), the a priory knowledge of Radio Frequency (RF) power is very important. Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques cans be applied to these scenarios to predict the required RF power in the available channels to achieve optimum Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper, we developed a time domain based optimized Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models for the prediction of real world RF power within the GSM 900, Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) FM and TV bands. Sensitivity analysis was used to reduce the input vector of the prediction models. The inputs of the ANN and SVR consist of only time domain data and past RF power without using any RF power related parameters, thus forming a nonlinear time series prediction model. The application of the models produced was found to increase the robustness of CR applications, specifically where the CR had no prior knowledge of the RF power related parameters such as signal to noise ratio, bandwidth and bit error rate. Since CR are embedded communication devices with memory constrain limitation, the models used, implemented a novel and innovative initial weight optimization of the ANN's through the use of compact differential evolutionary (cDE) algorithm variants which are memory efficient. This was found to enhance the accuracy and generalization of the ANN model.	algorithm;artificial neural network;bit error rate;cognitive radio;computation;computational intelligence;differential evolution;embedded system;fm broadcasting;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;quality of service;radio frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;support vector machine;time series;ultra high frequency;white spaces (radio)	Sunday Iliya;Eric Goodyer;John A.

RSSI-based techniques have been the preferred method for GSM localization on the handset as RSSI information is available in all cell phones. Although the GSM standard allows for a cell phone to receive signal strength information from up to seven cell towers, many of today's cell phones are low-end phones, with limited API support, that gives only information about the associated cell tower. In addition, in many places in the world, the density of cell towers is very small and therefore, the available cell tower information for localization is very limited. This raises the challenge of accurately determining the cell phone location with very limited information, mainly the RSSI of the associated cell tower. In this paper we propose a Hidden Markov Model based solution that leverages the signal strength history from only the associated cell tower to achieve accurate GSM localization. We discuss the challenges of implementing our system and present the details of our system and how it addresses the challenges. To evaluate our proposed system, we implemented it on Android-based phones. Results for two different testbeds, representing urban and rural environments, show that our system provides at least 156% enhancement in median error in rural areas and at least 68% enhancement in median error in urban areas compared to current RSSI-based GSM localization systems.	android;application programming interface;cluster analysis;experiment;fingerprint;hidden markov model;location-based service;markov chain;mobile phone;testbed	Mohamed Ibrahim;Moustafa Youssef	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962993	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;location-based service;hidden markov model	Mobile	20.46560605743277	72.76587694338876	3580

Under realistic modeling assumptions, these models result stiff and exhibit frequent discontinuities making them difficult to simulate by classic solvers. However, there are Linearly Implicit QSS (LIQSS) methods that can efficiently handle these types of systems providing faster and more accurate results. In order to corroborate these features, we first built the models corresponding to the different topologies of SMPS, and we analyzed the resulting equation structures in order to establish if they can be efficiently simulated by LIQSS algorithms. Then, we compared the simulation performance of LIQSS and the classic solver DASSL, showing that LIQSS results are from 3 to 200 times faster and noticeably more accurate than DASSL.	approximation algorithm;power supply unit (computer);scanning mobility particle sizer;simulation;solver;switched-mode power supply	Gustavo Migoni;Ernesto Kofman;Federico Bergero;Joaquín Fernández	2015	Simulation	10.1177/0037549715575197	control engineering;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics	EDA	71.48087468218027	42.17635425234614	3587

When an event occurs, the nodes that has discovered the event, are supposed to report it to their respective cluster heads. All of these nodes would wait for a specific time (based on its residual energy) to send the information. However, only the one of the sensing nodes is going to send the data to the clusterhead. The most appropriate node is the one with more residual energy and it will take its tour sooner to report the data. The waiting time for each individual node is based on its residual energy and its respective cluster head's energy. A channel access management based on CSMA is used for avoiding collision and multiple sending. The performance of this algorithm is evaluated in the sense on network lifetime and event detection reliability.	algorithm;routing	Farzad Tashtarian;Mohsen Tolou Honary;Majid Mazinani;Abolfazl Toroghi Haghighat;Jalil Chitizadeh	2008	2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications	10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493538	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	9.589297020966871	80.98323325819915	3590
77bd25d60aaa1730b7d7bfe3d2e35e44d538b73e	local algorithms for block models with side information	community detection;random graphs;local algorithms	There has been a recent interest in understanding the power of local algorithms for optimization and inference problems on sparse graphs. Gamarnik and Sudan (2014) showed that local algorithms are weaker than global algorithms for finding large independent sets in sparse random regular graphs thus refuting a conjecture by Hatami, Lovász, and Szegedy (2012). Montanari (2015) showed that local algorithms are suboptimal for finding a community with high connectivityin the sparse Erdös-Rényi random graphs. For the symmetric planted partition problem (also named community detection for the block models) on sparse graphs, a simple observation is that local algorithms cannot have non-trivial performance.  In this work we consider the effect of side information on local algorithms for community detection under the binary symmetric stochastic block model. In the block model with side information each of the n vertices is labeled + or - independently and uniformly at random; each pair of vertices is connected independently with probability a/n if both of them have the same label or b/n otherwise. The goal is to estimate the underlying vertex labeling given 1) the graph structure and 2) side information in the form of a vertex labeling positively correlated with the true one. Assuming that the ratio between in and out degree a/b is θ(1) and the average degree (a+b) / 2 = n{o(1), we show that a local algorithm, namely, belief propagation run on the local neighborhoods, maximizes the expected fraction of vertices labeled correctly in the following three regimes: |a--b|<2 and all 0 < α < 1/2 (a--b)2 > C (a+b) for some constant C and all 0 < α < 1/2 For all a,b if the probability that each given vertex label is incorrect is at most α* for some constant α* ∈ (0,1/2).  Thus, in contrast to the case of independent sets or a single community in random graphs and to the case of symmetric block models without side information, we show that local algorithms achieve optimal performance in the above three regimes for the block model with side information.  To complement our results, in the large degree limit α → ∞, we give a formula of the expected fraction of vertices labeled correctly by the local belief propagation, in terms of a fixed point of a recursion derived from the density evolution analysis with Gaussian approximations.	approximation;belief propagation;degree (graph theory);fixed point (mathematics);graph labeling;local algorithm;mathematical optimization;partition problem;random graph;recursion;software propagation;sparse matrix;stochastic block model;universal quantification;vertex (geometry)	Elchanan Mossel;Jiaming Xu	2016		10.1145/2840728.2840749	random graph;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;machine learning;mathematics;statistics	Theory	40.4998516613953	15.900463061481501	3594

However the medium access control (MAC) protocol of FDDI allows transmission of synchronous messages up to at most one half of the total bandwidth of the network. Shin and Zheng has proposed a modification to the FDDI MAC protocol, called FDDI-M, which can double a ring’s ability in supporting synchronous traffic (Shin and Zheng, 1995). It is widely known that the ability of timed token protocols such as FDDI to guarantee synchronous message deadlines is very dependent on the synchronous bandwidth allocation (SBA) schemes used, but the original paper does not address this issue. In this paper, we will compare the ability of FDDI-M to support synchronous traffic under different SBA schemes with that of FDDI. We use a new taxonomy of SBA schemes based on the strategy used to partition the synchronous bandwidth, and present an analytical study of the timing properties of the FDDI-M protocol using the Worst Case Achievable Utilization (WCAU) as the performance metric. The results show that while FDDI-M improves the WCAU values under one class of SBA schemes, its performance under the other category of SBA schemes is mixed. We also perform extensive simulation to study performance of FDDI-M for MPEG video traffic, and conclude FDDI-M does outperform FDDI significantly at heavy load. The effect of SBA schemes under overload conditions is also shown to be relatively minor, with the local SBA schemes actually performing better than the global schemes. 1 Work undertaken while on leave from Nanjing University, supported by a research grant from the	access control;moving picture experts group;simulation	Edward Chan;Daoxu Chen;Victor Chung Sing Lee	2001	Journal of Systems and Software	10.1016/S0164-1212(00)00085-6	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	-3.129081389149106	94.56978695581223	3600

The high PAPR causes the amplitude distortion on OFDM signals of the output at high power amplifier. The distortion degrades the transmission efficiency and bit error rate. In this paper, spinal codes are introduced for PAPR control system of OFDM. In this system, PAPR can be reduced by two steps of partial transmit sequence (PTS) and spinal codes. PTS reduces PAPR by phase rotation of multiple clusters and spinal codes can control by puncturing high PAPR symbols which exceed the threshold.	audio power amplifier;bit error rate;code;control system;distortion;modulation;multiplexing;power architecture platform reference;puncturing;subcarrier	Hodaka Tashiro;Yu Morishima;Ikuo Oka;Shingo Ata	2016	2016 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications (ISITA)		nonlinear distortion;electronic engineering;telecommunications;electrical engineering;control theory;mathematics	Arch	46.74304291181325	80.9086007814489	3601
7f8457ccfa2e37ea75a858f1de1bde5c1a32b5c5	cooperative localization with bounding constraints in mobile wireless sensor networks		In mobile wireless sensor networks (WSNs), error accumulation, and outlier problem seriously decrease the localization accuracy. To find a more accurate and cost-effective localization algorithm, cooperative localization with bounding constraints is proposed in this paper. By depicting the factor graph, the cooperative localization combines the trajectory prediction and observation correction of adjacent node. The trajectory prediction utilizes the polynomial Newton interpolation and bounding box which avoid the gross error. The observation correction explores the belief propagation and variational message passing, which are improved by judgment factor and punctuation function. Experiments are conducted to verify the proposed method in the aspect of algorithm parameter configuration, experiment parameter configuration, and distribution parameter configuration. The experiment results show that the proposed method in this paper outperforms than existing methods in large-scale WSNs.	algorithm;belief propagation;experiment;factor graph;interpolation;minimum bounding box;mobile phone;newton;newton's method;polynomial;software propagation;tree accumulation;variational message passing;variational principle	Zhaoyang Wang;Baihai Zhang;Xiaoyi Wang;Senchun Chai;Yuting Bai	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2867338	interpolation;belief propagation;wireless sensor network;variational message passing;monte carlo method;factor graph;outlier;mathematical optimization;minimum bounding box;computer science;distributed computing	Robotics	17.447879955982692	74.63345136623667	3606

The feature allows functionally dependent relations among test factors to be defined as functions in a general purpose programming language, PHP. These relations enforce constraints among test factor values and insure that all valid combinations of determinant factors are considered for the test design. Resulting usability improvements enable automated pairwise test designs to meet novel objectives: Cover equivalence classes of expected results; verify univariate and multivariate equivalence class boundaries; verify corners among intersecting boundaries and edges. The demonstration illustrates how embedded functions can improve automation, accuracy, control and flexibility in the test design process.	automation;embedded system;test design	George B.

These matrices are parameterized by positive integers L and n and a prime power q. Based on Pascal’s triangle we give an explicit construction of universally decodable matrices for any non-zero integers L and n and any prime power q where L ≤ q + 1. This is the largest set of possible parameter values since for any list of universally decodable matrices the value L is upper bounded by q + 1, except for the trivial case n = 1. For the proof of our construction we use properties of Hasse derivatives, and it turns out that our construction has connections to Reed-Solomon codes, Reed-Muller codes, and so-called repeated-root cyclic codes. Additionally, we show how universally decodable matrices can be modified so that they remain universally decodable matrices.

f568a2da0dc363e805fd942157d9cf06df8a02f5	a multi-path qos multicast routing protocol with slot assignment for mobile ad hoc networks	multi path;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;tree based routing;multicast routing	Mobile multimedia applications have recently generated much interest in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) supporting quality-of-service (QoS) communications. Due to the limited bandwidth of a wireless node, a QoS multicast routing is often blocked if there is not a single multicast tree with the requested bandwidth, even when there is sufficient bandwidth in the network to support the call. In this paper, a multi-path QoS multicast routing (MQMR) protocol for MANETs is proposed. The scheme offers dynamic time slot control using a multi-path tree (or a uni-path tree) to meet the bandwidth requirements of a call. The final multi-path QoS multicast tree meets the QoS requirements, and the aggregate bandwidth of the paths meets the bandwidth requirements of a call. To avoid the hidden terminal problem or insufficient bandwidth in the bandwidth reservation process, each destination uses a decision rule. Moreover, a bandwidth reservation scheme is used for selecting the reserved time slots on each node in the multi-path QoS multicast tree. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of MQMR in reducing network blocking and improving the call success ratio.	hoc (programming language);multicast;quality of service;routing	Neng-Chung Wang;Chao-Yang Lee	2012	Inf.

J. Chorin, O. H. Hald and R. Kupferman, Optimal prediction with memory, Phys. D, 166 (2002), pp. 239–257]. The optimal prediction method deals with problems that possess large and small scales and uses the conditional expectation to model the influence of the small scales on the large ones. In the current paper, we develop a different variant of the optimal prediction method as well as introduce and compare several approximations of this method. We apply the original and modified optimal prediction methods to a system of ODEs obtained from a particle method discretization of a hyperbolic PDE and demonstrate their performance in a number of numerical experiments.	approximation;discretization;experiment;numerical analysis;optimal control	Alina Chertock;David I.

Base Station (BS) cooperation architectures jointly with block transmission techniques, such as OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) for the downlink and SC-FDE (Single-Carrier with Frequency-Domain Equalization) for the uplink, are proven to be suitable for broadband wireless transmission systems. In BS cooperation systems MTs (Mobile Terminals) in adjacent cells share the same physical channel allowing the reducing of the frequency reuse and improving the spectral efficiency of cellular systems. In this paper we present a set of multiuser detection techniques for the uplink transmission in clustered architectures based on the C-RAN (Centralized-Radio Access Network) concept. We consider BS cooperation systems employing a universal frequency reuse approach. Our performance results demonstrate that by employing clustered techniques for the detection procedure it is possible to reduce substantially the signal processing complexity and the side information that must be transmitted by the backhaul structure.	telecommunications link	Filipe Casal Ribeiro;Rui Dinis;Francisco Cercas;Adão Silva	2017	Physical Communication	10.1016/j.phycom.2017.01.006	real-time computing;telecommunications	Arch	40.86890705733822	85.45638588922024	3635

A neural approach is combined with reliability values of each link obtained from minimal cuts in increasing network. The method simply evaluates minimal cuts from highly increasing networks and a two-dimensional combinatorial spectrum is obtained from an approximation formula for assigning reliability values for each link. These reliability values will be used in a neural approach as the upper-bound on reliability for improving reliability. An increasing network is considered with random failure in links and nodes. Evaluating minimal cuts in increasing networks requires significant computational effort, but, when approximated, computational time reduces significantly. The result shows significant improvement in reliability for increasing networks design when an approximated combinatorial spectrum is used as input to the neural networks. The approach reduces significantly the computational effort for reliability calculation.

This will increase the traffic in an already burdened telecommunications network. This research aims to optimally allocate radio resources to UEs such that the Smart Grid Quality of Service requirements are satisfied, with minimal effect on pre-existing telecommunication traffic caused by the imposition of Smart Grid UEs. To address this resource allocation problem, a Lotka-Volterra based resource allocation algorithm and scheduler was developed due to its ability to easily adapt to the dynamics of a telecommunications environment. Each `species' in the Lotka-Volterra scheme is modelled as either Data, Voice or Smart Grid traffic class in a Rayleigh-Fading channel. Unlike previous resource allocation algorithms, the Lotka-Volterra scheme allocated telecommunications resources to each class as a function of its growth rate. Subcarrier power allocation is non-uniform and the total power allocated to each class is based on the size of its queued traffic. By doing so, the Quality of Service requirements of the Smart Grid are satisfied, with minimal effect on pre-existing traffic. Class queue latencies are reduced by intelligent scheduling of periodic traffic and forward allocation of resources. Results also proved that for high traffic situations, the Lotka-Volterra resource allocation algorithm and scheduler provided a high degree of fairness between traffic classes, whilst ensuring minimum latency requirements of Smart Grid data.	algorithm;fairness measure;lotka–volterra equations;memory management;non-functional requirement;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;scheduling (computing);subcarrier;telecommunications network;while	Robert Webster;Kumudu S.

A hierarchical model, called a hierarchical triangulation, is described which approximates a surface by a network of triangular, planar facets whose projections in the plane are nested. In the paper, a dual representation of such a triangulation in the form of a structured graph is defined and the fundamental properties of this representation are discussed. An algorithm for converting a hierarchical triangulation into its dual form is given. As an example of application, an algorithm is described for the conversion of the dual graph into the standard triangle-oriented structure used for encoding triangulated irregular networks.

We first consider a two-station queueing model with two customer classes in which customers that are awaiting service at any queue can move to the other station, whenever it is free, to be served there immediately. Then we consider a cascade-type three-station system in which the third station, whenever it is free, can assist the other two stations. In both models, each station is fed by a renewal input with general i.i.d. inter-arrival times and general i.i.d. service times. keywords: cascade networks, fluid limit approach, interacting servers, stability, X-model.	harris affine region detector;interaction;lyapunov fractal;queueing theory;stochastic process	Rosario Delgado;Evsey Morozov	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-08219-6_1	real-time computing;computer network	Metrics	8.100420830025518	10.916013150071002	3650
6f9869ede45013ec9e844c3ceb276a794cd2dfbc	parallel computer routing and communication		In recent years, the topic of quality of service (QoS) has garnered much discussion and research amongst network designers. QoS has many de nitions, but here we focus on the notion of predictable communication performance such as guaranteed bandwidth and maximum latency. Such predictability not only supports continuous media (e.g. audio, video, virtual reality) and interactive response (e.g. client response time, real-time control), but also good parallel application performance. We discuss three major approaches for quality of service and evaluate their match for high performance system-area networks. We classify the wealth of approaches to network quality of service into three classes: virtual circuits, physical circuits, and global scheduling. These approaches di er signi cantly in their assumptions about the network environment and in how they bind communication tasks to physical resources, how physical resources are multiplexed and scheduled, and what information is available to do so. These choices fundamentally a ect the cost, complexity, and performance of each approach. Virtual circuit approaches attain the greatest exibility, but require complex hardware for implementation. Physical circuit approaches reduce hardware complexity, but need research to understand to best exploit them to deliver quality of service. Finally, we discuss two promising avenues for combining external control with simple network switches to deliver both low cost and high performance (route based and time-based global scheduling). These approaches are in their infancy and many research questions remain about their capabilities and generality.	complexity;multiplexing;network switch;parallel computing;quality of service;real-time clock;response time (technology);routing;scheduling (computing);video;virtual circuit;virtual reality	Jan van Leeuwen;Sudhakar Yalamanchili	1998		10.1007/3-540-69352-1	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;route;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;parallel computing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;dynamic source routing;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;routing information protocol	HPC	1.3961301225201732	61.68081500458963	3651

The numerical method is developed for efficient modelling of multiphase flow in porous media with complex interface motion and irregular solid boundaries. The Navier–Stokes equations are discretised using a finite volume approach, while the volume-of-fluid method is used to capture the location of interfaces. Capillary forces are computed using a semi-sharp surface force model, in which the transition area for capillary pressure is effectively limited to one grid block. This new formulation along with two new filtering methods, developed for correcting capillary forces, permits simulations at very low capillary numbers and avoids non-physical velocities. Capillary forces are implemented using a semi-implicit formulation, which allows larger time step sizes at low capillary numbers. We verify the accuracy and stability of the numerical method on several test cases, which indicate the potential of the method to predict multiphase flow processes. 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Daeman and Rijmen (2007) had obtained the distributions of the correlations between linear input and output combiners of uniform random functions and uniform random permutations. Our first contribution is to generalise these results to obtain the distributions of the correlations between arbitrary input and output combiners of uniform random functions and uniform random permutations. Recently, Todo et al. (2018) have proposed nonlinear invariant attacks which consider correlations between nonlinear input and output combiners for a key-alternating block cipher. In its basic form, a nonlinear invariant attack is a distinguishing attack. The second and the main contribution of this paper is to obtain precise expressions for the errors of nonlinear invariant attacks in distinguishing a key-alternating cipher from either a uniform random function or a uniform random permutation.	block cipher;distinguishing attack;input/output;linear cryptanalysis;nonlinear system;random permutation;stream cipher	Subhabrata Samajder;Palash Sarkar	2018	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive			Crypto	41.78793947658697	44.8077781383423	3659

This waterfilling solution is derived from a maximum mutual information argument with single transmission point. Motivated by the new technology of coordinated multiple point (CoMP) transmission , a new closed form solution named as joint-waterfilling is derived for a multicarrier system with multiple coordinated transmission point (CTP) [2]. However, like traditional waterfilling, to utilize this joint-waterfilling in practical system, an important issue is the complex transmitter and receiver design, such as variable-rate variable-power MQAM modulation and coding. In this paper we investigate a new constant-power joint-waterfilling scheme for a coordinated transmission system, in which two constant power levels are used across a properly chosen subset of subchannels. A rigorous worst-case performance bound of the constant-power joint-waterfilling is given based on the \emph{duality gap} analysis. Furthermore, a low-complexity constant-power adaptation algorithm is also developed. Numerical simulation result shows that the proposed constant-power joint-waterfilling has a negligible performance loss compared with true joint-waterfilling.	best, worst and average case;expectation–maximization algorithm;gap analysis;modulation;mutual information;numerical method;simulation;transmitter	Bing Luo;Qimei Cui;Xiaofeng Tao	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6133511	convex function;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	37.25907729071322	87.7667117078363	3661

These routing protocols use location information of mobile nodes in forwarding decisions. However, geographic routing protocols require location management services that handle the location updates sent by nodes and resolve their queries. Most of the location services found in MANET literature resolve the queries as the last stored location which usually makes degradation in the accuracy of the location information due to mobility. In this paper we propose a scalable and energy efficient location service which employs hierarchical geographic clustering structure and considers energy when selecting cluster leaders. Furthermore, our location service is mobility adaptive as it is assisted by mobility prediction model using the well known Kalman Filter. In the proposed protocol, the location servers estimate the locations of the mobile nodes by using the last location information instead of resolving the queries by the last known locations. Through computer simulation, we evaluate the performance of our proposal. Results show an improved performance of our proposal.	algorithm;cluster analysis;computer simulation;elegant degradation;generalized least squares;geographic routing;high-level synthesis;hoc (programming language);kalman filter;location-based service;scalability;whole earth 'lectronic link	Ebtisam Amar;Selma Boumerdassi	2011	2011 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2011.5779200	computer simulation;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;data mining;computer security;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	2.6119152286300613	81.79064124210316	3668

56c972958a799f100507bc88d281de4fc169be60	a back-tracing partition based on-path caching distribution strategy over integrated leo satellite and terrestrial networks		In these years, hybrid low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and terrestrial networks are widely developed for a variety of content distribution services, such as internet of things, satellite sensor networks and tactical distribution networks, due to low deployment cost and broader coverage capability. However, an unreasonable distribution strategy in the integrated LEO satellite and terrestrial user network will incur prolonged content access latency and significant overheads for users, due to obviously time-varying topology and limited on-board resources. In this paper, therefore, we proposed a back-tracing partition directed on-path caching mechanism for the publisher/subscriber distribution over the hybrid LEO constellation and terrestrial network. In the proposed mechanism, a back-tracing algorithm instructed node selection strategy is well-designed as well as a cross-slot graph based Dijkstra routing algorithm. Through avoiding intermittent connectivity as much as possible, the proposed mechanism could efficiently reduce the redundant transmissions of data access for different users, by fetching objective file mainly from a limited group of intermediate caching nodes, instead of directly from the source node. The simulation results verified the proposed method can obviously degrade the overall overheads and access delay of all users compared with the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm.

(Xn, Yn) in R 2 is the subset of points (X~, Y~) having the property that one of the four quadrants centered at (X i, Yi) contains no (Xj, Yj), j 4: i. Sometimes, these points are also called maximal vectors, or admissible points. Algorithms for finding the outer layer include: (i) the naive algorithm: for each (Xi, Yi) , carry out n 1 comparisons to determine whether it is on the outer layer or not. The time taken by this algorithm is 0(n2), i.e., there exist positive constants c o, c t, n o such that, for n >/n 0, the time is bounded from below by Co n2 and from above by Cl n2.

The general goal is to remove a collection of edges from an undirected vertex-colored graph $$G$$ G such that in the resulting graph $$G'$$ G ′ all the connected components are colorful (i.e., any two vertices of the same color belong to different connected components). We want $$G'$$ G ′ to optimize an objective function, the selection of this function being specific to each problem in the framework. We analyze three objective functions, and thus, three different problems, which are believed to be relevant for the biological applications: minimizing the number of singleton vertices, maximizing the number of edges in the transitive closure, and minimizing the number of connected components. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for the first problem. This result disproves the conjecture of Zheng et al. that the problem is $$ NP$$ N P -hard (assuming $$P \ne NP$$ P ≠ N P ). Then, we show that the second problem is $$ APX$$ A P X -hard, thus proving and strengthening the conjecture of Zheng et al. that the problem is $$ NP$$ N P -hard. Finally, we show that the third problem does not admit polynomial-time approximation within a factor of $$|V|^{1/14 - \epsilon }$$ | V | 1 / 14 - ϵ for any $$\epsilon > 0$$ ϵ > 0 , assuming $$P \ne NP$$ P ≠ N P (or within a factor of $$|V|^{1/2 - \epsilon }$$ | V | 1 / 2 - ϵ , assuming $$ZPP \ne NP$$ Z P P ≠ N P ).	algorithm;color;connected component (graph theory);graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;loss function;optimization problem;polynomial;polynomial-time approximation scheme;time complexity;transitive closure;vertex (geometry);zpp (complexity)	Anna Adamaszek;Alexandru Popa	2014	Algorithmica	10.1007/s00453-014-9926-0	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;graph coloring;mathematics;geometry;hardness of approximation;algorithm	Theory	24.73140024038145	21.98663060261661	3696

The following discussion is concerned with such problems of initial verification and maintenance for digital systems. Systems can fail to function properly either because of incorrect specification, design, or implementation; or else because of physical deterioration or damage. Problems caused by incorrect specification are extremely difficult to deal with formally. Many cases of faulty design or implementation can be detected either by formal analysis techniques (e.g., logic circuit analysis) or by simulation methods. Of course, actual physical implentations such as integrated circuits must be subjected to measurement before final acceptance. This process of measuring the output response with specified signals applied to the inputs is called testing and is useful both for initial acceptance and also for verification of continued validity during use.	digital electronics;integrated circuit;logic gate;network analysis (electrical circuits);simulation;software testing	Edward J.

In this paper, we model a network of UAV-BSs as a Poisson point process (PPP) operating at a certain altitude above the ground users. We adopt an air-to-ground (A2G) channel model that incorporates line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation. Thus, UAV-BSs can be decomposed into two independent inhomogeneous PPPs. Under the assumption that NLoS and LoS channels experience Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading, respectively, we derive approximations for the coverage probability and average achievable rate, and show that these approximations match the simulations with negligible errors. Numerical simulations have shown that the coverage probability and average achievable rate decrease as the height of the UAV-BSs increases.

As increasingly expanding of network scale and increasing number of nodes and edges, it would spend a lot of time that using Floyd algorithm whose time complexity is defined O(n3) or Breadth-first Search(BFS) algorithm whose time complexity is defined O(nm) to compute network diameter. Moreover, BFS is only effective in non-weighted graph. For decreasing the time complexity of computing network diameter, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, Compressing Graph(CG), which bases on the correlative knowledge of graph compression. Through the analysis of time complexity, it shows our algorithm is a feasible method applied for diverse topology graphs and its range of time complexity is O(n) to O(n3).	data compression;floyd–warshall algorithm;time complexity	Rui Yang;Shijie Zhou;Chengyu Fan	2008	2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists	10.1109/ICYCS.2008.352	time complexity;combinatorics;average-case complexity;breadth-first search;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;worst-case complexity;approximation algorithm;algorithm;rabin–karp algorithm	HPC	16.05164223746615	32.53381839252782	3715

Furthermore, we analyze the file-transfer time of the proposed framework by Markov chain. The analysis results show that the proposed framework outperforms TCP in terms of the file-transfer time and the goodput. Furthermore, in the transfer of a large-sized file, the overhead of the proposed AL-FEC mechanism is small in terms of the resource efficiency.	acknowledgement (data networks);communications satellite;error detection and correction;file transfer;forward error correction;goodput;markov chain;overhead (computing);performance-enhancing proxy;proxy server	Kyu-Hwan Lee;Jong-Mu Kim;Jae Hyun Kim	2015	EURASIP J.

Clearly, there is a strong need for good high-performance, e.g., GPU-accelerated, algorithms to solve it. Unfortunately, among existing GPU-enabled algorithms to solve the problem, there is none that can be considered the best on every graph, disregarding the graph characteristics. Indeed, the choice of the right and most appropriate algorithm to be used is often left to inexperienced users. In this paper, we introduce a novel parametric multi-step scheme to evaluate existing GPU-accelerated algorithms for SCC decomposition in order to alleviate the burden of the choice and to help the user to identify which combination of existing techniques for SCC decomposition would fit an expected use case the most. We support our scheme with an extensive experimental evaluation that dissects correlations between the internal structure of GPU-based algorithms and their performance on various classes of graphs. The measurements confirm that there is no algorithm that would beat all other algorithms in the decomposition on all of the classes of graphs. Our contribution thus represents an important step towards an ultimate solution of automatically adjusted scheme for the GPU-accelerated SCC decomposition.	graphics processing unit;strongly connected component	Stefano Aldegheri;Jiri Barnat;Nicola Bombieri;Federico Busato;Milan Ceska	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-58943-5_42	mathematical optimization;computer science	Logic	27.01434801319896	7.279179647363851	3722

As an essential functionality in SON, cell outage detection is developed to autonomously detect macrocells or femtocells that are inoperative and unable to provide service. Previous cell outage detection approaches have mainly focused on macrocells while the outage issue in the emerging femtocell networks is less discussed. However, due to the two-tier macro-femto network architecture and the small coverage nature of femtocells, it is challenging to enable outage detection functionality in femtocell networks. Based on the observation that spatial correlations among users can be extracted to cope with these challenges, this paper proposes a Cooperative femtocell Outage Detection (COD) architecture which consists of a trigger stage and a detection stage. In the trigger stage, we design a trigger mechanism that leverages correlation information extracted through collaborative filtering to efficiently trigger the detection procedure without inter-cell communications. In the detection stage, to improve the detection accuracy, we introduce a sequential cooperative detection rule to process the spatially and temporally correlated user statistics. In particular, the detection problem is formulated as a sequential hypothesis testing problem, and the analytical results on the detection performance are derived. Numerical studies for a variety of femtocell deployments and configurations demonstrate that COD outperforms the existing scheme in both communication overhead and detection accuracy.	apache axis;collaborative filtering;downtime;multitier architecture;network architecture;organizing (structure);overhead (computing);self-organizing map;sun outage	Wei Wang;Jin Zhang;Qian Zhang	2013	2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6566865	telecommunications;computer science;collaborative filtering;computer security;computer network	Mobile	26.672621229584944	89.40401238154865	3731

As a rule, distributions with a special dependence structure (i.e., complying with a system of conditional independence relations) are considered; graphical Markov models and especially Bayesian networks are often used. This paper proposes application of compositional models for this puropose. In addition to a theoretical background, a heuristic algorithm solving one part of a model learning process is presented. Its basic idea, construction of an approximation exploiting informational content of given low-dimensional distributions in a maximal possible way, was proposed by Albert Perez as early as in 1977.	approximation algorithm;bayesian network;computational problem;heuristic (computer science);kullback–leibler divergence;markov chain;markov model;maximal set;possibility theory	Radim Jirousek	2003			probability distribution;random variable;geometric distribution;combinatorics;probability mass function;convolution of probability distributions;markov property;heavy-tailed distribution;regular conditional probability;inverse-chi-squared distribution;mathematical statistics;mathematics;additive markov chain;graphical model;markov model;joint probability distribution;generalized inverse gaussian distribution;inverse gaussian distribution;k-distribution;empirical probability;statistics;variable-order markov model	ML	39.19235205091776	11.302381306670313	3740

At each step, partial rectification can reduce the functional difference between an old implementation and a new specification. Our algorithm is especially effective for multiple error circuits.

In this talk, we consider three different aspects of implementing network coding in body area networks, from low-level construction of modules in chips, to full circuit integration, to protocol design. The first concerns the choices of implementation of finite field arithmetic for network coding, trading off computational complexity for retransmission. The second issue considers the overall use of energy, when network coding and physical-layer error correction can be used in a complementary fashion. Finally, we consider energy use when coding is incorporated in the transmission protocol. Coding changes the way in which acknowledgements are managed, as well as forwarding in the types of simple relay scenarios that arise in body area networks.	communications protocol;computational complexity theory;error detection and correction;high- and low-level;integrated circuit;linear network coding;relay;retransmission (data networks)	Muriel Médard	2015			linear network coding;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;multiple description coding;computer network	Networks	13.684718222133249	91.80072793650164	3762

Furthermore, we propose optimal adaptive scheduling of the in-band uplink-receptions and d ownlink-transmissions of the BS such that the uplink-downlink rate/throughput region is maximized a nd the outage probabilities of the uplink and downlink channels are minimized. Practically, this result s in selecting whether in a given time slot the BS should receive from user 1 or transmit to user 2 based on the qualities of the in-band uplink-reception and downlink-transmission channels. Compared to the perfo rmance achieved with a conventional fullduplex division (FDD) base station, two main gains can be hig hlighted: 1) Increased uplink-downlink rate/throughput region; 2) Doubling of the diversity gain o f b th the uplink and downlink channels.	dvd region code;duplex (telecommunications);period-doubling bifurcation;scheduling (computing);sun outage;telecommunications link;throughput	Mohsen Mohammadkhani Razlighi;Nikola Zlatanov	2017	CoRR		real-time computing;telecommunications	AI	37.77183445310396	84.96762045488629	3766
14ceeff804613bd1c4fd26e46977b5b724866cdb	asynchronous hardware implementations for crypto primitives		Abstract Cryptography plays a major role in all the modern applications, where the Galois field (GF) arithmetic circuits are inevitable. In this paper, asynchronous GF (2 m ) and m -bits GF ( p ) multiplier, inverter, and exponentiator are proposed, where the hardware is repeatedly reused for m iterations without synchronous registers ( m = l o g 2 p ). Also, this paper proposes an asynchronous implementation of GF (2 163 ) affine coordinate based ECC scalar multiplication that includes the point addition and point doubling. Here, the inverse is calculated using Fermatu0027s Little theorem. The entire scalar multiplication is done using only two GF (2 163 ) multipliers without any hardware registers that are replaced by a completion detection logic. The same proposed logic is used in the asynchronous 128-bits AES design. The power dissipation of these proposed designs are much less than the existing designs due to the elimination of synchronous registers. Our proposed asynchronous logic is free from the glitches and metastability . The proposed asynchronous GF (2 16 ) multiplier design achieves 99.6% of improvement in switching power reduction than scalable Montgomery [5] based multiplier using 45 nm CMOS technology.		M.

We apply optical wireless communication (OWC) for transmitting information. The thinfilm is used as a rechargeable battery that absorbs the power when the incident light beam goes through the CCR and reflects On-Off-Keying (OOK) modulated signals back to the reader. The energy harvested during the transmission is used to drive the CCR inside the tag to modulate the OWC signals back to the reader. The proposed system is proved to be more secure and having much higher available stored energy. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated based on the simulations and the results are discussed. According to the simulations, by using a 550nm wavelength with 0.4W of the transmitted power, the scheme achieves a data rate of 100bps and about 0.19W of the harvested power while the communication distance is up to 0.25m.	data rate units;embedded system;identification scheme;modulation;optical wireless;performance evaluation;radio-frequency identification;ray (optics);rechargeable battery;simulation;transmitter;uncompressed video;x.690	Khemry Khourn;Jiang Liu;Wasinee Noonpakdee;Shigeru Shimamoto	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666774	radio-frequency identification;embedded system;optical wireless communications;telecommunications;computer science;retroreflector;energy harvesting;thin film;optical communication;computer network	Mobile	63.170519238060834	60.459388880591604	3773
a5920ec0bfc0bcd00c868769aab6e77219b7fd1a	backdoors to tractable valued csp		We extend the notion of a strong backdoor from the CSP setting to the Valued CSP setting (VCSP, for short). This provides a means for augmenting a class of tractable VCSP instances to instances that are outside the class but of small distance to the class, where the distance is measured in terms of the size of a smallest backdoor. We establish that VCSP is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the size of a smallest backdoor into every tractable class of VCSP instances characterized by a (possibly infinite) tractable valued constraint language of finite arity and finite domain. We further extend this fixed-parameter tractability result to so-called “scattered classes” of VCSP instances where each connected component may belong to a different tractable class.	backdoor (computing);cobham's thesis;connected component (graph theory);parameterized complexity	Robert Ganian;M.

An extension namely, contourlet transform recently indicated its advantages in image fusion with better efficiency in multi-resolution and multi-direction representation and calculation. However, the even higher computational complexity it requires turns out to be a disastrous concern in embedded applications. In this paper, we implement an acceleration system on a heterogeneous TI Da Vinci dual core processor consisting of an ARM processor core and a DSP processor core. The ARM core controls the fusion procedure by extracting the luminance bits and invoking the DSP core to carry out the time-consuming part of the contourlet transform. The partitions of tasks are determined after the program is analyzed and profiled at functional level to make full use of the computational capability of the heterogeneous platform. Initial measured improved performance results are obtained and analyzed with projected further improvements.	arm architecture;algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;contourlet;digital signal processor;embedded system;image fusion;input/output;mathematical optimization;multi-core processor;optimizing compiler;run time (program lifecycle phase);speedup;the matrix;very long instruction word;vii;wavelet transform	Yipeng Wei;Yongxin Zhu;Yuehua Shi;Tingting Mo;Xiaoyi Ding;Jie Zhong	2009	2009 International Conference on Scalable Computing and Communications; Eighth International Conference on Embedded Computing	10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.30	embedded system;computer vision;computer science;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	10.088116954148537	39.16852260798117	3781

In particular, the paper deals with the stability of the problems in which the operator of mathematical expectation appears in the objective function, constraints set is “deterministic” and the probability measure space is equipped with the Kolmogorov or the Wasserstein metric. The stability results are furthermore employed to statistical estimates in the stochastic programming problems.

To date, mathematical developments of the basic properties of such systems have been based either on simplified continuous-time approximate models or on linearized discrete-time models where the quantizer is replaced by an additive white uniform noise source. In this paper, we rigorously derive several basic properties of a simple discrete-time single integrator loop sigma-delta modulator with an accumulate-and-dump demodulator. The derivation does not require any assumptions on the correlation or distribution of the quantizer error, and hence involves no linearization of the nonlinear system, but it does show that when the input is constant, the state sequence of the integrator in the encoder loop can be modeled exactly as a linear system in an appropriate space. Two basic properties are developed: 1) the behavior of the sigma-delta quantizer when driven by a constant input and its relation to uniform quantization, and 2) the rate-distortion tradeoffs between the oversampling ratio and the average mean-squared quantization error.	analog-to-digital converter;approximation algorithm;delta modulation;delta-sigma modulation;distortion;encoder;fitness approximation;linear system;noise generator;nonlinear system;oversampling;quantization (signal processing);utility functions on indivisible goods	Robert M.

To meet the strict time-to-market requirements of systems containing these chips, compilers require retargetable alogrithms for effectively assigning values to the memory partitions. The EMBARC algorithm described in this paper is the first algorithm to attempt to realize a comprehensive, retargetable algorithm for effective partition assignment of variables in an arbitrary memory hierarchy. It supports a wide variety of memory models including on-chip SRAMs, multiple layers of caches, and even uncached DRAM partitions. Even though it is designed to handle such a range of memory hierarchies, EMBARC is capable of generating partition assignments of similar quality to algorithms designed for specific memory hierarchies. We use a large range of benchmarks and memory models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the EMBARC algorithm. We found that EMBARC can achieve 99% of the improvement of a dedicated algorithm for cacheless systems without SRAM. Also, for cacheless systems with SRAM, EMBARC generated the optimal partition assignment for benchmarks that were simple enough to hand-generate an optimal partition assignment. As further proof of EMBARC's generality, we also show how EMBARC can be used to generate partition assignments for a memory hierarchies with two on-chip caches that can be accessed in parallel.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);compiler;dynamic random-access memory;embedded system;memory bank;memory hierarchy;memory management (operating systems);memory model (programming);requirement;static random-access memory	Jason Hiser;Jack W.

Disjoint multi-path routing (DMPR) requires the multiple paths to be link- or node-disjoint. Implementation of both MPR and DMPR poses significant challenges in obtaining loop-free multiple (disjoint) paths and effectively forwarding the data over the multiple paths, the latter being significant in data-gram networks. In this paper, we develop a disjoint multipath routing strategy using colored trees with an objective to minimize the total cost of the routing paths in a network. Two trees, namely red and blue, rooted at a given drain is formed. We demonstrate through extensive simulations that the developed technique is extremely effective in optimizing the average cost of the paths. In addition, we also observe that the developed approach minimizes the average minimum (minimum of the two paths) cost, which is lower than that obtained by earlier algorithms. The colored tree approach simply doubles the size of the routing table when two link- or node-disjoint paths to a specific node is needed.	algorithm;link-state routing protocol;load balancing (computing);minkowski portal refinement;multipath routing;network congestion;pokémon red;quality of service;routing table;simulation;throughput;transmitter	Ravi Balasubramanian;Srinivasan Ramasubramanian	2006	Proceedings of 15th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks	10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286270	mathematical optimization;routing;static routing;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;load balancing;multipath routing;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Networks	-4.104723324398464	82.54072968497529	3831

We consider the frequency selective fading channels and adopt the zero padding (ZP) based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) as the modulation of the transmission. Due to the mixture of the first and the second transmission phases, the joint estimation problem becomes much challenging than that in the traditional point-to-point communication systems. By introducing some redundancy, we modify the structure of ZP-OFDM to cope with non-zero frequency synchronization errors. We then propose a nulling-based least square (NLS) method for joint CFO and channel estimation. A detailed performance analysis of NLS has been conducted, where we prove that the unbiasedness of NLS and derive the closedform estimation mean-square-error (MSE) at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

However, there is some weakness in the conventional approach due to the fact that the real limit is more directly related to angle difference and its accuracy depends on the accuracy of dynamic models of the power system components. Thus, additional capacity can be released under normal conditions if transient constraints are applied in terms of angle difference instead of power flow. With the wider penetration of Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS), it is now possible to use angle measurements for transient stability limits. This paper investigates the effect of defining a transient stability limit in terms of angle rather than active power and presents the benefits that an angle constraint can offer.	bibo stability;ibm power systems;qualitative comparative analysis;system of measurement	Song Guo;Douglas Wilson;Sean Norris;Janusz Bialek	2011	2011 2nd IEEE PES International Conference and Exhibition on Innovative Smart Grid Technologies	10.1109/ISGTEurope.2011.6162665	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Visualization	66.29106501927733	36.613402004796804	3856

DQMAN organizes the network into dynamic clusters forming spontaneous master-slave architectures to manage the radio resources. In multihop settings its performance is hampered by intercluster interference (interference caused between adjacent clusters) and the presence of isolated nodes that cannot get associated to any cluster. The Three Hop Master minislot (3HMS) and the active listening (AL) mechanisms are presented in this paper to cope with these problems. It is worth noting that these mechanisms could be indeed applied to any centralized network or any clustered ad hoc network.

3612263ff2cc6bc18592fdd3fa62b1e050586eae	controlling the loss of quantum correlations via quantum memory channels	quantum correlations;quantum mutual information;entanglement of formation;fidelity	A generic behavior of quantum correlations during any quantum process taking place in a noisy environment is that they are non-increasing. We have shown that mitigation of these decreases providing relative enhancements in correlations is possible by means of quantum memory channels which model correlated environmental quantum noises. For two-qubit systems subject to mixtures of two-use actions of different decoherence channels we point out that improvement in correlations can be achieved in such way that the input-output fidelity is also as high as possible. These make it possible to create the optimal conditions in realizing any quantum communication task in a noisy environment.

8636c9a0d96cef61d6d18d5e10b9b0cbd1869b16	multi-cost routing for energy and capacity constrained wireless mesh networks	wireless mesh networks;energy and capacity constraints;multi cost routing	We propose a class of novel energy-efficient multi-cost routing algorithms for wireless mesh networks, and evaluate their performance. In multi-cost routing, a vector of cost parameters is assigned to each network link, from which the cost vectors of candidate paths are calculated using appropriate operators. In the end these parameters are combined in various optimization functions, corresponding to different routing algorithms, for selecting the optimal path. We evaluate the performance of the proposed energy-aware multi-cost routing algorithms under two models. In the network evacuation model, the network starts with a number of packets that have to be transmitted and an amount of energy per node, and the objective is to serve the packets in the smallest number of steps, or serve as many packets as possible before the energy is depleted. In the dynamic one-to-one communication model, new data packets are generated continuously and nodes are capable of recharging their energy periodically, over an infinite time horizon, and we are interested in the maximum achievable steady-state throughput, the packet delay, and the energy consumption. Our results show that energy-aware multi-cost routing increases the lifetime of the network and achieves better overall network performance than other approaches.

8b16b5df7b1450a9e788f85c0ac19966688ffc35	biologically inspired methods for organizing distributed services on sensor networks		We propose to make use of a completely distributed way of implementing OS services for wireless sensor networks (WSN). I.e. instead of having an instance of the OS on each node of a WSN the services of the OS are distributed over the WSN. Of course this approach implies specific challenges. Two of them are discussed in the paper: Migration of services to nodes such that the overall communication costs are minimized and forming clusters with the tendency to concentrate service requests inside the clusters and at the same time minimizing intra-cluster communication. For both problems biologically inspired solutions are discussed. Service migration is mapped on an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) technique while as a clustering heuristics Division of Labor in swarms of social insects is used.	ant colony optimization algorithms;cluster analysis;eusociality;heuristic (computer science);operating system	Franz-Josef Rammig;Tales Heimfarth;Peter Janacik	2007			wireless sensor network;ant colony optimization algorithms;computer network;heuristics;cluster analysis;computer science;distributed computing	Mobile	9.997557159695788	78.59949637801114	3879

0ecb5f370d8e66baeb853294ccefc270e8373a3b	exclusive graph searching	graph searching;pathwidth;trees;exclusivity	This paper tackles the well known graph searching problem, where a team of searchers aims at capturing an intruder in a network, modeled as a graph. This problem has been mainly studied for its relationship with the pathwidth of graphs. All variants of this problem assume that any node can be simultaneously occupied by several searchers. This assumption may be unrealistic, e.g., in the case of searchers modeling physical searchers, or may require each individual node to provide additional resources, e.g., in the case of searchers modeling software agents. We thus introduce and investigate exclusive graph searching, in which no two or more searchers can occupy the same node at the same time. As for the classical variants of graph searching, we study the minimum number of searchers required to capture the intruder. This number is called the exclusive search number of the considered graph. Exclusive graph searching appears to be considerably more complex than classical graph searching, for at least two reasons: (1) it does not satisfy the monotonicity property, and (2) it is not closed under minor. Moreover, we observe that the exclusive search number of a tree may differ exponentially from the values of classical search numbers (e.g., pathwidth). Nevertheless, we design a polynomial-time algorithm which, given any n-node tree T, computes the exclusive search number of T in time $$O(n^3)$$ O ( n 3 ) . Moreover, for any integer k, we provide a characterization of the trees T with exclusive search number at most k. Finally, we prove that the ratio between the exclusive search number and the pathwidth of a graph is bounded by its maximum degree.	approximation algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);cobham's thesis;graph (discrete mathematics);np-hardness;pathwidth;polynomial;software agent;time complexity;universal quantification;whole earth 'lectronic link	Lélia Blin;Janna Burman;Nicolas Nisse	2013	Algorithmica	10.1007/s00453-016-0124-0	graph power;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;graph bandwidth;null graph;graph toughness;regular graph;forbidden graph characterization;aperiodic graph;mathematics;distance-hereditary graph;critical graph;complement graph	AI	25.86866302353661	25.281103828388193	3888

In this paper, we generalize his construction to cnfs of arbitrary clause length and then show that the unsatisfiable cnfs generated are, usually, “minimally unsatisfiable,” that is, the removal of even one clause results in a satisfiable cnf. We first review Spence’s method in a more general setting and then illustrate this minimality property.	algorithm;automated theorem proving;conjunctive normal form;desktop computer;experiment;laptop;theory	Robert Cowen	2012	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	NLP	6.510547820393411	17.61436880071827	3890

This frequency assignment problem can be modelled with vertex labelings of graphs. An <i>L</i>(2,1)-labeling of a graph <i>G</i> is a function <i>f</i> from the vertex set <i>V</i>(<i>G</i>) to the set of all nonnegative integers such that |<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)-<i>f</i>(<i>y</i>)| ges 2 if <i>d</i>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)=1 and |<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)-<i>f</i>(<i>y</i>)| ges 1 if <i>d</i>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)=2 , where <i>d</i>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) denotes the distance between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> in <i>G</i>.

The basic idea of the method is to determine, for each criterion, the region of the weight space associated with the efficient solutions that have a value in that criterion below the minimum already known (by default, the minimum in the payoff table). If this region is empty, the nadir value has been found. Otherwise, a new efficient solution is computed using a weight vector picked from the delimited region and a new iteration is performed. The method is able to find the nadir values in MOLP problems with any number of objective functions, although the computational effort increases significantly with the number of objectives. Computational experiments are described and discussed, comparing two slightly different versions of the method.	linear programming	Maria João Alves;João Paulo Costa	2009	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2008.10.003	mathematical optimization;computer experiment;linear programming;nadir;mathematics;geometry;efficiency;algorithm	HPC	25.17421536859085	10.31364369632867	3898

Traditional hierarchical shared bus communication architectures can only support limited bandwidths and are not scalable for very high-performance designs. Bus matrix-based communication architectures consist of several parallel busses which provide a suitable backbone to support high-bandwidth systems but suffer from high-cost overhead due to extensive bus wiring inside the matrix. Manual traversal of the vast exploration space to synthesize a minimal cost bus matrix that also satisfies performance constraints is practically infeasible. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing an automated approach for synthesizing a bus matrix communication architecture, which satisfies all performance constraints in the design and minimizes wire congestion in the matrix. To validate our approach, we consider several industrial strength applications from the networking domain and show that our approach results in up to 9times component savings when compared to a full bus matrix, and up to 3.2times savings when compared to a maximally connected reduced bus matrix, while satisfying all performance constraints in the design.	coreconnect;internet access;internet backbone;mpsoc;multiprocessing;network congestion;overhead (computing);requirement;scalability;system on a chip;the matrix;throughput;wiring	Sudeep Pasricha;Nikil D.

Of course, the first step is to design the product with the performance requirements in mind. But the second step is equally important: testing and characterizing the device to guarantee that it fully meets customer performance expectations. Conducting this testing thoroughly for complex devices fabricated in deep-submicron (DSM) designs—now in the neighborhood of 130nm technologies and below—is becoming increasingly more difficult. But it’s not just microprocessor manufacturers that are using at-speed tests these days. Increasingly, more manufacturers of all types of ICs are aggressively moving to add at-speed tests to their portfolio. This special issue focuses on the important problem of speed test and speed binning of digital ICs. Topics in this issue span the entire design and fabrication process of an IC, from initial design through production test and characterization. First, Intel’s Kee Sup Kim, Subhasish Mitra, and Paul G. Ryan provide a comprehensive survey of delay testing techniques for high-performance designs. They begin by presenting manufacturing data to illustrate the necessity of delay testing. In particular, they show that 500 parts per million would not be achievable without delay testing. They then discuss how to differentiate between delay problems due to manufacturing variations and those from random defects. Any strategy for speed binning must consider random defects. Moreover, a structural test strategy, even running at a lower speed, can still play an important role in screening random delay defects. Finally, they discuss two important issues in structural testing: avoiding the adverse impact of a timeborrowing design style on signal propagation, and delivering test patterns with compression for test memory reduction. For speed binning of high-performance parts, high-quality transition fault testing is necessary, and structural delay testing requires a careful design of clock schemes to avoid potential yield loss. Next, Xijiang Lin et al. from Mentor Graphics discuss improved features in an ATPG tool for structural delay testing. They begin by discussing how to use on-chip phase-locked loop (PLL) clock generator circuitry to create at-speed scan patterns. They provide a detailed example to illustrate how to model a PLL in the ATPG tool, and how to devise the clock scheme in at-speed scan testing. They then propose an approach that combines stuck-at and transition fault tests to improve test quality and reduce tester memory requirements. The goal is to achieve a desirable stuck-at coverage level with reasonably high transition fault coverage. The second half of the article presents a case study of a large industrial design. The authors classify transition fault coverage within each clock domain and between clock domains, and they discuss combining stuck-at and transition fault tests. They conclude that using an on-chip clock generator for atspeed structural test is cost-effective. In the third article, LogicVision’s Stephen Pateras describes BIST implementation techniques to achieve structural at-speed testing, and he addresses important timing setup issues from a logic BIST perspective. These issues can occur at the interfaces between a logic BIST controller and scan chains, or between flip-flops in different clock domains. There are also timing issues in distributing the scan-enable signal, handling multicycle paths, and dealing with different frequency domains. Pateras proposes logic-BIST-based techniques to address each timing issue. He concludes that logic BIST is a fieldproven approach for at-speed structural test applications.

The axioms require that the sought metric respects the effects of additive and multiplicative noise in reducing our ability to discriminate spectra, as well as they require continuity of statistical quantities with respect to perturbations measured in the metric. We then present a particular metric which abides by these requirements. The metric is based on the Monge-Kantorovich transportation problem and is contrasted with an earlier Riemannian metric based on the minimum-variance prediction geometry of the underlying time-series. It is also being compared with the more traditional Itakura-Saito distance measure, as well as the aforementioned prediction metric, on two representative examples.	axiomatic system;itakura–saito distance;metric;multiplicative noise;rca spectra 70;requirement;scott continuity;spectral density;time series;transportation theory (mathematics);utility functions on indivisible goods	Tryphon T.

As in the case of orthogonal space-time block codes, all transmitted symbols are separately decoded both in the relays and the destination. Therefore, decoding complexity is linear. Many of the proposed solutions in the literature are distributed space-time codes which are designed for limited number of relays. In the proposed scheme, as many number of relays as necessary can be included to increase diversity. Moreover, the proposed scheme has better signal-to-noise ratio improvement compared to relay selection schemes. Lastly, the new method satisfies power consumption fairness among relay terminals and requires no knowledge of topology information.	code;discrete cosine transform;fairness measure;huffman coding;relay;signal-to-noise ratio	Ali Eksim;Mehmet Ertugrul Çelebi	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394532	block code;space–time block code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics;computer network;satisfiability	Mobile	35.1866570271984	75.6676706318272	3921

We introduce the true recurrence point recurrence plot, TRP, a variant of the traditional RP excluding the sojourn points. This is a cleaned up RP free from recurrence points originating from tangential motion, and hence a more robust representation of unstable periodic orbits.

0de2c40eba723b9a39eaad652183adcab07eb32c	energy efficient target coverage in partially deployed software defined wireless sensor network		Limited energy resources of sensor nodes are one of the main weaknesses of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It has long been recognized that conventional methods of data transmission in WSNs are energy inefficient. However, implementation of coordinated, energy-aware routing and power control strategies among sensor nodes is difficult due to distributed network control. Software defined networking (SDN) is a new networking paradigm which overcomes this issue by decoupling the network control and data planes. As an emerging technology, originally envisioned for wired networks, SDN cannot be expected to completely replace traditional WSNs in near future. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate how to save energy in partially deployed software-defined WSN (SD-WSN). In particular, the paper considers the scenario of WSN deployed for monitoring set of targets with known locations, and analyses how the incremental SDN deployment and various power- mode switching policies could affect the WSN lifetime.

For this purpose test patterns to detect shorts for each standard-cell are created separately. A new defect-oriented test generator (DOT) is using these single cell test pattern lists to create test patterns for the complete circuit. Additionally, test patterns for the routing network will be created. This work targets mainly shorts, but also other defects can be treated in a similar way. In order to generate tests only for relevant combinations of shorted nodes, the critical area for both the cells and the routing network is determined separately and the probability for each short is computed. Shorts inside the routing network can show sequential behaviour. The proposed test pattern generator is also able to find tests for such kind of defects. As the effort to test sequential defects can vary from short to short, a new testability analysis is presented. Based on this analysis a redesign of the circuit layout is proposed. This """"layout for testability"""" approach is therefore a defect oriented equivalent for """"design for testability"""" methods."""	application-specific integrated circuit;cell (microprocessor);circuit design;circuit diagram;design for testing;routing;software bug;standard cell;test card	Joachim Sudbrock;Jaan Raik;Raimund Ubar;Wieslaw Kuzmicz;Witold A.

This approach guides us to find the power-optimal solution corresponding to the specifications of various wireless standards by exploring single-loop feedback and feedforward topologies with different filter order, number of quantizer bits, and oversampling ratios. Unlike previous multimode designs, this approach provides a better power efficiency. Based on this approach, a system-level design of a digitally programmable delta-sigma modulator for 4G radios is presented.	delta-sigma modulation;electronic system-level design and verification;feedforward neural network;level design;oversampling;performance per watt;quantization (signal processing);reconfigurability;simulation	Yi Ke;Jan Craninckx;Georges G.

This statement is definitely true when amplitude, phase, frequency and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) fluctuate significantly within the observation interval used to estimate them. Unfortunately, these estimation algorithms can be very sensitive to narrow-band disturbances, unless these contributions are explicitly included in the model at the expense of a larger computational complexity. However, if the observation intervals are so short that the waveform parameter variations each of them are minor, then algorithms based on static phasor model can provide accurate results with a reasonably low computational burden. Since the waveform fundamental frequency is a key parameter for power systems monitoring and control, in this paper the estimation accuracy of three classes of state-of-the-art algorithms based on a static signal model is analyzed and compared when only few waveform cycles affected by both steady-state disturbances (e.g. harmonics) and amplitude or phase oscillations are collected.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;ibm power systems;neural oscillation;phasor;spectral density estimation;steady state;waveform	Daniel Belega;David Macii;Dario Petri	2016	2016 IEEE International Workshop on Applied Measurements for Power Systems (AMPS)	10.1109/AMPS.2016.7602810	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;computer science;statistics	Metrics	55.80843663130347	12.598113554884083	3963

The platform consists of two MicroBlaze RISC processors and a number of hardware co-processors used for the processing of packet payloads (Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Lempel-Ziv Compression). The co-processors can be connected either directly to the processors or using a shared bus. The functionality of the co-processors is dynamically reconfigured to meet the requirements of the network workload. The system has been implemented on the Xilinx Virtex II Pro platform and the network traces from real passive measurements have been used for performance evaluation. The use of dynamically reconfigurable co-processors for network applications shows that the performance speedup versus a static version varies from 12% to 35% in the best case and from 10% to 15% on average, depending on the network traffic fluctuation.	field-programmable gate array;performance evaluation	Christoforos Kachris;Stephan Wong;Stamatis Vassiliadis	2009	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2008.05.011	embedded system;reduced instruction set computing;parallel computing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;integrated circuit;interconnection;implementation;coprocessor;field-programmable gate array;access network	HPC	-0.5418610346436129	61.65181746716562	3968

However, this triangulation is not intrinsically distinguished from other triangulations with the same vertex set, it is not preserved under isometric deformations of the surface. Delaunay tessellations of polyhedral surfaces are defined intrinsically in terms of empty discs on surfaces. The edges of Delaunay tessellations are geodesics on the original polyhedral surface (and not necessarily straight edges in the 3-space). For any polyhedral surface there exists a unique Delaunay tessellation. It is not necessarily strongly regular, i.e. the intersection of two closed cells may not be a single closed cell.  For discretization of notions of Riemannian geometry it is natural to deal with intrinsic tessellations. We define a discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator for simplicial surfaces. It depends only on the intrinsic geometry of the surface and its edge weights are positive. The intrinsic Laplace-Beltrami operator is based on an intrinsic Delaunay triangulation of the surface. We describe an incremental flipping algorithm to construct such triangulations together with an overlay structure which captures the relationship between the extrinsic and intrinsic triangulations. We demonstrate some numerical benefits of the intrinsic Laplace-Beltrami operator.  This talk is based on the original results obtained in [1] and [2].	algorithm;delaunay triangulation;discretization;intrinsic dimension;isometric projection;numerical analysis;polyhedron;strongly regular graph;vertex (graph theory)	Alexander I.

For each l it is known that, up to only finitely many exceptional m, one can find x asking Berlekamp's minimum number ql(m) of questions, i.e., the smallest integer q satisfying the sphere packing bound for error-correcting codes. The Ulam-REnyi problem amounts to finding optimal error-correcting codes for the binary symmetric channel with noiseless feedback, first considered by Berlekamp. In such concrete situations as optical transmission, error patterns are highly asymmetric--in that only one of the two bits can be distorted. Optimal error-correcting codes for these asymmetric channels with feedback are the solutions of the half-lie variant of the Ulam-REnyi problem, asking for the minimum number of yes-no questions needed to find an unknown m-bit number x, if up to l of the negative answers may be erroneous/mendacious. Focusing attention on the case l = 1; in this self-contained paper we shall give tight upper and lower bounds for the half-lie problem. For infinitely many m's our bounds turn out to be matching, and the optimal solution is explicitly given, thus strengthening previous estimates by Rivest, Meyer et al.	set packing	Ferdinando Cicalese;Daniele Mundici	2000		10.1007/3-540-44968-X_16	combinatorics;error detection and correction;information theory;combinatorial optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	Theory	38.24458794381906	56.53724076158497	3986

We investigate some relations between the hyperbolicity of a graph and the hyperbolicity of its atoms, that are the subgraphs resulting from the clique-decomposition invented by Tarjan [34, 45]. More precisely, we prove that the maximum hyperbolicity taken over all the atoms is at least the hyperbolicity of G minus one. We also give an algorithm to slightly modify the atoms, which is at no extra cost than computing the atoms themselves, and so that the maximum hyperbolicity taken over all the resulting graphs is exactly the hyperbolicity of G. An experimental evaluation of our methodology is provided for large collaboration networks. Finally, we deduce from our theoretical results the first linear-time algorithm to compute the hyperbolicity of an outerplanar graph.	systolic freedom	Nathann Cohen;David Coudert;Guillaume Ducoffe;Aurélien Lancin	2017	Theor.

However, NEM switches have relatively slow switching times (tens of nanoseconds) due to their mechanical nature. Adiabatic Dynamic Logic (ADL) is an approach that can achieve ultra-low-energy dissipation when operating at electrically slow speeds. We show through simulation that NEM switches can be used to implement ADL circuits that exploit its zero leakage property while operating at mechanically fast switching speeds. At least an order of magnitude reduction in energy consumption compared to conventional circuit design is shown in simulation using analytical compact modeling.	cmos;circuit design;conductance (graph);image scaling;logic gate;nem (cryptocurrency);network switch;simulation;spectral leakage;thyristor	Christopher Lawrence Ayala;Antonios Bazigos;Daniel Grogg;Yu Pu;Christoph Hagleitner	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2015.7169217	control engineering;nanoelectromechanical systems;electronic engineering;adiabatic circuit;logic gate;network switch;computer science;engineering;pass transistor logic;control theory	Arch	18.166818691557967	57.65423802504287	3994

Such network attractors can display a high degree of sensitivity to noise both in terms of the regions of phase space visited and in terms of the sequence of transitions around the network. The two types of network are intimately related—one can directly bifurcate to the other. In this paper we attempt to quantify the effect of additive noise on such network attractors. Noise increases the average rate at which the networks are explored and can result in “macroscopic” random motion around the network. We perform an asymptotic analysis of local behavior of an escape model near heteroclinic/excitable nodes in the limit of noise η → 0 as a model for the mean residence time T near equilibria. The heteroclinic network case has T proportional to − ln η while the excitable network has T given by a Kramers’ law, proportional to exp(B/η). There is singular scaling behavior (where T is proportional to 1/η) at the bifurcation between the two types of network. We also explore transition probabilities between nodes of the network in the presence of anisotropic noise. For low levels of noise, numerical results suggest that a (heteroclinic or excitable) network can approximately realize any set of transition probabilities and any sufficiently large mean residence times at the given nodes. We show that this can be well modeled in our example network by multiple independent escape processes, where the direction of first escape determines the transition. This suggests that it is feasible to design noisy network attractors with arbitrary Markov transition probabilities and residence times.	additive white gaussian noise;bifurcation theory;dynamical system;excitable medium;image scaling;in-phase and quadrature components;markov chain;numerical analysis;utility functions on indivisible goods	Peter Ashwin;Claire M.

The locations of jump discontinuities of a function are recovered approximately, one by one, by means of ratios of so called higher order Fourier-Jacobi coefficients of the function. It is shown that the location of singularity of a piecewise constant function with one discontinuity is recovered exactly and the locations of singularities of a piecewise constant function with multiple discontinuities are recovered with exponential accuracy. The method is applicable to piecewise smooth functions as well, however the accuracy of the approximation sharply declines. In addition, the stability and complexity of the method is discussed and some numerical examples are presented.	approximation	George Kvernadze	2006	Mathematical and Computer Modelling	10.1016/j.mcm.2005.11.003	step function;singularity;smoothness;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;complexity;higher-order logic;piecewise linear function;numerical analysis;approximation;calculus;mathematics;fourier analysis;numerical stability;piecewise;classification of discontinuities	Theory	83.24582622453643	11.714760701717958	4015

The utilization of this capability includes the transmission of data stream for any interactive application. In this application the execution flow needs to be synchronized with video and audio streams. To transmit the data, video and audio streams in a synchronized way, the streams are packetized in data structures more adapted to the transmission. Some of these structures are PES (Packetized Elementary Stream) and TS (Transport Stream). TS packets are data structures that include information about synchronization, presentation and programs, which are being transmitted. The TS construction is an operation that can be called multiplexing. This operation includes some critical and complex tasks, such as PES analysis, table constructions, and the program clock reference calculation. This paper presents the design and implementation of a digital television multiplexer based on the ITU-T H.222.0 recommendation. This multiplexer was designed for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). With this implementation a 338 Mbps bitrate was achieved.

Our main result is to show that an appropriate compress-and-forward scheme supports essentially the same reliable data rate as the quantize-map-and-forward and noisy network coding schemes [1], [2]; thus, it is approximately optimal - in the sense the data rate is a universal constant away from the cut-set upper bound. We characterize the compress-and-forward scheme through an abstract flow formulation, a generalization of flow on linking systems. This characterization allows for efficient computation of the minimal amount of information that has to flow through each node in the network.	computation;data compression;data rate units;linear algebra;linear network coding;relay;shortest path problem;uncompressed video	Adnan Raja;Pramod Viswanath	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2011.6033835	linear network coding;telecommunications;information theory;theoretical computer science;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;statistics;computer network	Arch	33.66400544085712	71.6939555628551	4025
2465c8198aeaea437ce778fa886ca9caa55e547b	a fast dual gradient algorithm for distributed model predictive control with coupled constraints		This paper proposes a DMPC approach for a family of discrete-time linear systems with local (uncoupled) and global (coupled) constraints. The proposed approach is based on the dual problem of an overall MPC optimization problem involving all systems which is then solved distributively using a modified distributed Nesterov-accelerated-gradient algorithm. To further reduce the computational requirement, this approach allows for early termination of the distributed gradient algorithm. This is made possible via a consensus algorithm that determines the satisfaction of the termination condition and by appropriate tightening of the coupled constraints. Under reasonable assumptions, the approach is able to produce a suboptimal solution so long as the network of the systems is connected while ensuring recursive feasibility and exponential stability of the closed-loop system. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by a numerical example.	chandra–toueg consensus algorithm;computation;duality (optimization);gradient;iteration;linear system;mathematical optimization;minimal polynomial (field theory);numerical analysis;optimization problem;recursion;time complexity	Zheming Wang;Chong Jin Ong	2017	2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2017.8264592	mathematical optimization;control theory;distributed element model;duality (optimization);numerical stability;linear system;model predictive control;computer science;convex function;algorithm;optimization problem;exponential stability	EDA	63.992979934356086	8.813159056765638	4042

In modern complex systems, the powermanagement design is not a simple task and it is quite difficult to evaluate whether the designed strategy is the best. In this paper, we propose a new method for overhead estimation of the required power-management unit, based on system-level abstract specification. It enables a designer to explore various power-management strategies in a short time and select the most suitable one. It is especially useful for ultra low-power systems, in which the power-management unit is a significant power consumer. The proposed method is simpler and faster than the existing approaches, and thus it speeds-up the low-power systems development process.	algorithm;complex systems;complexity;floor and ceiling functions;high- and low-level;high-level synthesis;ibm power systems;low-power broadcasting;overhead (computing);power management unit;software development process;systemc;systems design	Dominik Macko	2017	2017 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)	10.1109/DSD.2017.19	power management unit;real-time computing;complex system;power management;computer science	EDA	3.456337008465287	55.20541009248162	4047

The proposed ultra-low-power transmitter and high-efficiency energy harvester facilitates battery-less remote control with a small feature size. Each shot of the PZT generator produces an energy of more than 20 μJ Moreover, the piezoelectric harvester achieves a high conversion efficiency of up to 80% through the use of an inductor-switching circuit. Finally, the wireless transmitter realizes ultra-low power frequency synthesis by means of injection locking and frequency multiplication techniques. Operating at the 433 MHz ISM band, the transmitter delivers an output power of −12.9 dBm with a power consumption of 750 μW.

a0cceacdf6a4058a897ad2ed7bd5dd8dca7f34ea	applications of α-strongly regular distributions to bayesian auctions		Two classes of distributions that are widely used in the analysis of Bayesian auctions are the monotone hazard rate (MHR) and regular distributions. They can both be characterized in terms of the rate of change of the associated virtual value functions: for MHR distributions, the condition is that for values <i>v</i> < <i>v</i><sup>′</sup>, φ (<i>v</i><sup>′</sup>) - φ (<i>v</i>) ≥ <i>v</i><sup>′</sup> - <i>v</i>, and for regular distributions, φ (<i>v</i><sup>′</sup>) - φ (<i>v</i>) ≥ 0. Cole and Roughgarden introduced the interpolating class of α-strongly regular distributions (α-SR distributions for short), for which φ (<i>v</i><sup>′</sup>) - φ (<i>v</i>) ≥ α (<i>v</i><sup>′</sup> - <i>v</i>), for 0 ≤ α ≤ 1.  In this article, we investigate five distinct auction settings for which good expected revenue bounds are known when the bidders’ valuations are given by MHR distributions. In every case, we show that these bounds degrade gracefully when extended to α-SR distributions. For four of these settings, the auction mechanism requires knowledge of these distributions (in the remaining setting, the distributions are needed only to ensure good bounds on the expected revenue). In these cases, we also investigate what happens when the distributions are known only approximately via samples, specifically how to modify the mechanisms so that they remain effective and how the expected revenue depends on the number of samples.	fault tolerance;interpolation;monotone	Richard Cole;Shravas Rao	2017	ACM Trans.

It is known that the problem is NP-hard and its optimization version admits a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS). Parameterized algorithms have been then developed to solve the problem when d is small. In this paper, with a new approach (called the 3-string approach), we first design a parameterized algorithm for binary strings that runs in O(nL+nd^3@?6.731^d) time, while the previous best runs in O(nL+nd@?8^d) time. We then extend the algorithm to arbitrary alphabet sizes, obtaining an algorithm that runs in time O(nL+nd@?(1.612(|@S|+@b^2+@b-2))^d), where |@S| is the alphabet size and @b=@a^2+1-2@a^-^1+@a^-^2 with @a=|@S|-1+13.

2a188dd1ea9f9ee97ac549a0f3e53efd0f31b027	impact of occupancy-based buildings-to-grid integration on frequency regulation in smart grids		The bulk of the produced electricity powers buildings; 120 million homes and 5 million commercial buildings dominate the U.S. energy consumption. Creative design of Buildings-to-Grid (BtG) integration methods is an essential component of smart cities. Buildings' occupancy behavior is a crucial component of successful BtG integration, as buildings become more sophisticated and people spend more time in offices and cities-making occupancy behavior one of the leading factors in energy consumption and thus largely impacting power grid dynamics. In this paper, we study the impact of integrating occupancy-based building dynamics and constraints with power grid transients, while focusing on frequency regulation. First, dynamics of building clusters and building-integrated power networks are presented-both operating at different time-scales. Second, occupancy-based building constraints are discussed. Third, the time-scale discrepancies are investigated, and a model predictive control-based algorithm that formulates occupancy-based BtG integration is given. Finally, case studies demonstrate the impact of the proposed framework on energy savings and significant frequency regulation.	algorithm;smart city	Bing Dong;Ahmad F.

This algorithm is unique in the sense that it does not rely on the maximum flow computations. Based on this, we then show that, given a positive integer k, the problem of making a multigraph G k-edge-connected by adding the smallest number of new edges can be solved in O(m+minen 2+n 3 log n, kn 3) time, where e (n 2) is the number of pairs of vertices between which G has an edge.	algorithm;k-edge-connected graph	Hiroshi Nagamochi;Toshihide Ibaraki	1995		10.1007/3-540-59408-6_68	maximum flow problem;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	24.78025589181449	24.53420723787492	4070

By means of this approach the packing problem becomes a global finitedimensional continuous optimization problem. The strategy is based on the new concept of sentinels. Sentinels sets are finite subsets of the items to be packed such that, when two items are superposed, at least one sentinel of one item is in the interior of the other. Minimal sets of sentinels are found in simple 2−dimensional cases. Numerical experiments and pictures showing the potentiality of the new technique are presented.	algorithm;approximation;continuous optimization;convex set;experiment;global optimization;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;quantum superposition;set packing	Ernesto G.

A simple analytical expression of the capacity is derived for any number of transmit and receive antennas. This characterization clearly shows the substantial gain in terms of capacity over the no CSI-T case and gives a good insight on the effect of the number of antennas used. In addition, an On-Off transmission scheme is proposed and is shown to be asymptotically capacity-achieving.	1-bit architecture;bang–bang control;channel capacity;channel state information;ergodicity;mimo;marginal model;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Abdoulaye Tall;Zouheir Rezki;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2012	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/WCL.2012.070512.120335	transmitter;3g mimo;spatial correlation;multi-user mimo;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;channel state information;radio receiver;precoding;channel capacity;computer network;mimo	Mobile	38.18075829920818	76.0710862929757	4085

Besides reachability computations, the proposed algorithms can also be used for solving path problems. We discuss issues related to the efficient implementation of these algorithms, and present experimental results that show the direct algorithms perform uniformly better than the iterative algorithms. A side benefit of this work is that we have proposed a new methodology for evaluating the performance of recursive queries.	algorithm;computation;directed graph;hierarchical and recursive queries in sql;iteration;iterative method;performance evaluation;reachability;recursion (computer science);transitive closure	Rakesh Agrawal;Shaul Dar;H.

This ensures efficient utilization of the spectrum. Energy detection is one of the technique to detect the primary users that are receiving data within the communication range of a CR user. In this work, detection performance of the primary user (PU) signal on CR receiver is investigated. In particularly, the OFDM based CR receiver detect the primary user OFDM signal, where CR receiver is equipped with multiple antennas based energy detector. We observe significant improvement in primary user detection with SLC based energy detection at the MIMO CRs in comparison to single antenna CRs.	cognitive radio;digraphs and trigraphs;ibm systems network architecture;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multi-level cell;signal-to-noise ratio;subcarrier;ti-nspire series;with high probability	Vijaykumar Kuppusamy;Rajarshi Mahapatra	2008	2008 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CrownCom 2008)	10.1109/CROWNCOM.2008.4562561	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	48.07502921775661	85.02960115020606	4099

Given a graph G = (V, E) , a clique is a complete subgraph in G. The clique partitioning problem is to partition the vertices in G into a number of cliques such that each vertex appears in one and only one clique. The clique partitioning problem has important applications in many areas including VLSI design automation, scheduling, and resources allocation. In this paper we present a parallel algorithm to solve the above problem for arbitrary graphs using a Hopfield Neural Network model of computation. Our model uses a large number of simple processing elements or neurons, based on the McCulloch-Pitts binary neuron. The proposed algorithm has a time complexity of O(1) for a neural network with n vertices and c cliques. A parallel simulator, based on PVM, was implemented for the proposed algorithm on a Linux Cluster. Many graphs were tested, all yielding optimum solutions.	artificial neural network;artificial neuron;clique problem;combinatorial optimization;computer cluster;graph partition;hopfield network;linux;mathematical optimization;model of computation;np-completeness;network model;optimization problem;parallel virtual machine;parallel algorithm;partition problem;scheduling (computing);time complexity;vertex (geometry);walter pitts	Haidar M.

A rich array of refinements of this basic algorithm are possible within the homotopy framework. Such refinements are needed in any practical implementation and are discussed in detail. Implications for the design of integrated large-scale mathematical programming software are also briefly considered.	algorithm;euler;kerrison predictor;linear programming;mathematical optimization;newton;numerical analysis;programming tool	John L.

Here, nodes are unnecessarily blocked from spatially reusing the channel although parallel transmissions would have most likely been successful had they occurred. For mitigating this well-known problem, transmit power control schemes have been at the forefront of solutions. In this paper, we propose another scheme: By the assignment of a 'cell number' selected by the coordinating node to all other nodes in each cell, nodes only retain the payload portion of frames with headers indicating the same number while their long-term fail rates do not exceed a limit. With the aid of a realistic IEEE 802.11b simulator as our evaluation platform, we show that this scheme provides comparable results to as well as enhances the performance of a conventional open loop transmit power control scheme.	fail-safe;ibm tivoli storage productivity center;interference (communication);microsoft forefront;simulation	Raymond J.

Since no convexity assumptions are made, the problem is reformulated in relaxed form. The state equation is discretized using a finite element method in space and a 0-scheme in time, while the controls are approximated by blockwise constant relaxed controls. The first result is that, under appropriate assumptions, the properties of optimality, and of extremality and admissibility, carry over in the limit to the corresponding properties for the relaxed continuous problem. We also propose progressively refining discrete conditional gradient and gradient-penalty methods, which generate relaxed controls, for solving the continuous relaxed problem, thus reducing computations and memory.

Such equation can be considered as a generalization of the Fisher equation and other wellknown convection–diffusion–reaction equations. Two important cases are considered. The case of density-independent diffusion and the case of density-dependent diffusion. When the parameters of the equation are constant, the Bernoulli equation is used as the simplest equation. This leads to new traveling-wave solutions. Moreover, some wavefront solutions can be derived from the traveling-wave ones. The case of time-dependent velocity in the convection term is studied also. We derive exact solutions of the equations by using the Riccati equation as simplest equation. The exact and traveling-wave solutions presented in this paper can be used to explain many biological and physical phenomena. 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The conventionally used optimization criterion for bandpass filtering is to maximize the sidelobe attenuation by minimizing the stopband energy and minimizing the maximum stopband ripple. The proposed optimization scheme is designed particularly to combat RFI with completely known or partially known statistics. Simulation results for the scenario of strong narrowband RFI show that the proposed optimization scheme offers about 14% data rate improvement in the system's data throughput when compared to the traditional schemes.	crosstalk;data rate units;digital monetary trust;digital subscriber line;discrete cosine transform;filter bank;frequency band;ici (programming language);information sciences institute;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;modulation;multi-chip module;radio frequency;ripple effect;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;throughput	Yingsi Liang;Oren Eliezer;Dinesh Rajan	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134453	telecommunications;computer science;band-pass filter;line filter	Vision	48.1605800087588	83.0854935081213	4131

Since then much work has been done in applying this to bubble chamber pictures. The parallel processing simulator, originally written for an IBM 7094 system, has now been rewritten for a CDC 3600 system. This paper describes briefly the structure of syntactic descriptive models by considering their specific application to bubble chamber pictures. How the description generated in this phase can be embedded in a larger “conversation” program is explained by means of a certain specific example that has been worked out. A partial generative grammar for “handwritten” English letters is given, as are also a few computer-generated outputs using this grammar and the parallel processing simulator mentioned earlier.	algorithm;cdc 3000;computer-generated holography;embedded system;generative grammar;ibm 7090;parallel computing;simulation	R.

The performance of channel aggregation represented by these strategies is evaluated using continuous time Markov chain models. Moreover, simulation results based on various traffic distributions are utilized in order to evaluate the validity and preciseness of the mathematical models.	aggregate data;blocking (computing);channel capacity;cognitive radio;erlang (unit);greedy algorithm;markov chain;markov model;mathematical model;numerical linear algebra;performance evaluation;simulation;superuser	Lei Jiao;Frank Y.

If ρATSP and ρATSPP denote the integrality ratios for the asymmetric TSP and its path version, then ρATSPP ≤ 4ρATSP − 3. We prove an even better bound for node-weighted instances: if the integrality ratio for ATSP on node-weighted instances is ρ ATSP , then the integrality ratio for ATSPP on node-weighted instances is at most 2ρ ATSP − 1. Moreover, we show that for ATSP node-weighted instances and unweighted digraph instances are almost equivalent. From this we deduce a lower bound of 2 on the integrality ratio of unweighted digraph instances.	directed graph;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;travelling salesman problem	Anna Köhne;Vera Traub;Jens Vygen	2018	CoRR		mathematics;combinatorics;linear programming relaxation;travelling salesman problem;upper and lower bounds	Theory	22.977343375655078	19.824804036270105	4144

Due to the uncertainty associated with renewable sources and prominent fluctuations in the load demand, it is extremely important to maintain the overall energy balance in such grids. In this paper, the distributed energy management is achieved using a Multi-agent System which provides a flexible and reliable solution to control and manage smart grids. Adaptive fuzzy systems are designed to instill intelligent decision making capability in the agents of multi-agent system. When renewable sources are inadequate, the sustainability of the system is not guaranteed and multi-agent system is capable of deciding the mode of operation such that the system reliability and performance is not compromised. The proposed algorithm maintains power balance in the system and also sustains desired values for the State of Charge of storage units in order to guarantee extended battery life. The Energy management system also implements a cost optimization algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to minimize operating costs and maximize profits earned by the grid. The proposed energy management algorithm is tested and validated on a practical test system which inherits most of the features of a small-scale smart grid.	multi-agent system	R.

6fa5ead3a379835e020e075fc8c3a9b35c208152	crosstalk free coding systems to protect noc channels against crosstalk faults		Reliability of modern multicore and many-core chips is tightly coupled with the reliability of their on-chip networks. Communication channels in current Network-on-Chips (NoCs) are extremely susceptible to crosstalk faults. In this work, we propose a set of rules for generating classes of crosstalk free coding systems to protect communication channels in NoCs against crosstalk faults. Codewords generated through these rules are free of u0027101u0027 and u0027010u0027 bit patterns, which are the main sources of crosstalk faults in NoC communication channels. The proposed rules determine: (1) the weights of different bit positions in a coding system to reach crosstalk free codings, and (2) how the coding might be utilized in an NoC to prevent crosstalk generating bit patterns in NoC channels. Using the proposed set of rules, designers can obtain coding systems which are crosstalk free for any widths of communication channels. Compared to conventional Forbidden Pattern Free (FPF) systems, the proposed methodology is able to provide unique representation to any input values at the lower bound of the codeword lengths. Analyses show that the proposed rules, along with the proposed encoding/decoding mechanisms, are effective in preventing forbidden pattern coding systems for network-on-chips of any arbitrary channel width.	algorithm;code word;crosstalk;manycore processor;multi-core processor;network on a chip;overhead (computing);parameter (computer programming);triplet state	Kimia Soleimani;Ahmad Patooghy;Nasim Soltani;Lake Bu;Michel A.

ba22bcc50af35c73522b973dab7a4eb21542da10	a two-dimensional kinetic triangulation with near-quadratic topological changes	convex hull;kinetics;kinetic data structure;lower bound;algebraic curve	A triangulation of a set S of points in the plane is a subdivision of the convex hull of S into triangles whose vertices are points of S. Given a set S of n points in ${\Bbb R}^2,$ each moving independently, we wish to maintain a triangulation of S. The triangulation needs to be updated periodically as the points in S move, so the goal is to maintain a triangulation with a small number of topological events, each being the insertion or deletion of an edge. We propose a kinetic data structure (KDS) that processes $n^2 2^{O(\sqrt{\log n \cdot \log \log n})}$ topological events with high probability if the trajectories of input points are algebraic curves of fixed degree. Each topological event can be processed in $O(\log n)$ time. This is the first known KDS for maintaining a triangulation that processes a near-quadratic number of topological events, and almost matches the $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound [1]. The number of topological events can be reduced to $nk\cdot 2^{O(\sqrt{\log k \cdot \log\log n})}$ if only k of the points are moving.	kinetic triangulation	Pankaj K.

d0d11a9b79539cbc3c6d8f2ea6d43c9cde6bd41e	on the integer-valued variables in the linear vertex packing problem		Given a graph with weights on vertices, the vertex packing problem consists of finding a vertex packing (i.e. a set of vertices, no two of them being adjacent) of maximum weight. A linear relaxation of one binary programming formulation of this problem has these two well-known properties: (i) every basic solution is (0, 1/2, 1)-valued, (ii) in an optimum linear solution, an integer-valued variable keeps the same value in an optimum binary solution.	independent set (graph theory);set packing	Jean-Claude Picard;Maurice Queyranne	1977	Math.

0514731282f09b4ca8c6fb079bc11cd79bce9254	50 years of the golomb–welch conjecture		Since 1968, when the Golomb–Welch conjecture was raised, it has become the main motive power behind the progress in the area of the perfect Lee codes. Although, there is a vast literature on the topic and it is widely believed to be true, this conjecture is far from being solved. In this paper, we provide a survey of papers on the Golomb–Welch conjecture. Furthermore, new results on Golomb–Welch conjecture dealing with perfect Lee codes of large radii are presented. Algebraic ways of tackling the conjecture in the future are discussed as well. Finally, a brief survey of research inspired by the conjecture is given.	berlekamp–welch algorithm;code;common lisp;computational complexity theory;disk sector;experiment;fourier analysis;golomb ruler;jeffrey lagarias;linear programming;polynomial;qr code;set packing;social inequality;tiling window manager;welch's method	Peter Horák;Dongryul Kim	2018	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2017.2786675	algebraic number;conjecture;combinatorics;lonely runner conjecture;lattice (order);beal's conjecture;golomb coding;collatz conjecture;linear programming;pure mathematics;mathematics	Theory	38.89475355625708	41.2904920673951	4189

fee43d78aaf545c640d612c0bf01ba3a73934146	towards computational complexity theory on advanced function spaces in analysis		Pour-El and Richards [PER89], Weihrauch [Weih00], and others have extended Recursive Analysis from real numbers and continuous functions to rather general topological spaces. This has enabled and spurred a series of rigorous investigations on the computability of partial differential equations in appropriate advanced spaces of functions. In order to quantitatively refine such qualitative results with respect to computational efficiency we devise, explore, and compare natural encodings (representations) of compact metric spaces: both as infinite binary sequences (TTE) and more generally as families of Boolean functions via oracle access as introduced by Kawamura and Cook ([KaCo10], Sect. 3.4). Our guide is relativization: Permitting arbitrary oracles on continuous universes reduces computability to topology and computational complexity to metric entropy in the sense of Kolmogorov. This yields a criterion and generic construction of optimal representations in particular of (subsets of) (L^p) and Sobolev spaces that solutions of partial differential equations naturally live in.	computation;computational complexity theory;spaces	Akitoshi Kawamura;Florian Steinberg;Martin Ziegler	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-40189-8_15	complexity;computational resource;computational learning theory;asymptotic computational complexity	Logic	-2.636639763777999	12.610346323812257	4204

This technique is based on modifying existing codes for generic bursts by replacing a portion of their check matrix with a more efficient one, in light of the additional constraints on the burst. We illustrate this procedure by modifying the Fire, Burton and Gilbert codes to address bursts with maximum Hamming weight, bursts with solid errors, or bursts with internal “mini-bursts”. We provide evidence that the redundancy of the codes we construct can be very good through examples, one of which is optimal within the class of cyclic codes.	1-bit architecture;cyclic code;gilbert cell;hamming code;hamming weight;parity-check matrix;polynomial;redundancy (engineering);vii;window function	Luis Alfonso Lastras-Montaño;Mario Blaum	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284044	block code;reed–muller code;cyclic redundancy check;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;discrete mathematics;hamming distance;online codes;burst error-correcting code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;cyclic code;tornado code;linear code;hamming code;expander code;luby transform code;mathematics;forward error correction;hamming(7,4);raptor code;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;algorithm;statistics;coding theory	Theory	41.15573393313452	57.779379873013234	4211

However, there are concerns regarding RF interference between PLC networks and other radio operators. It is imperative that the interference dynamics of PLC systems be fully understood in advance of any large-scale roll-out. In this work, we experiment with two interference scenarios: notch-infilling due to non-linear mixing and mitigation of radiated emissions using RF chokes. In our controlled test bed environment, we measure RF emissions from the power line devices in the 1 MHz to 30 MHz range. Through the results and simulation, we demonstrate that the effect of non-linear devices may be less of a concern than initially thought, and that simple methods can be employed to control local RF interference.	catastrophic interference;experiment;imperative programming;interference (communication);nonlinear system;power supply unit (computer);power-line communication;rf modulator;radio frequency;simulation;telecommunications network;testbed;the legend of zelda: the minish cap;vii	Brad W.

In many applications, e.g., power supplies for processors, the reference for the output is piecewise constant, and typically the power converter must effectively reject disturbances due to fast changes in the load behavior. Furthermore, the stress on the converter components must be kept within specified limits to ensure increased life-time and high reliability of the end equipment. To answer this challenge, this paper investigates a previously proposed set-theoretic method for constrained reference tracking, and extends the approach towards handling additive disturbances which can be either measured or estimated. Within the method a nominally stabilizing control law and the associated domain of attraction are exploited to define the tracking control law which inherits the domain of attraction from the stabilizing one even in the presence of bounded additive disturbance. The approach is experimentally validated on a real-life buck converter and the measurement results are provided. Although, the control solution is illustrated on a buck converter only, the result is generic, and can be applied to any power converter with a linear averaged model.	analog-to-digital converter;buck converter;central processing unit;control theory;electric power conversion;experiment;integrated circuit;linear system;optimal control;power electronics;power supply;real life;real-time clock;real-time locating system;set theory;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Veaceslav Spinu;Stefano Lisi;Mircea Lazar	2014	2014 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2014.6981501	forward converter;control engineering;electronic engineering;buck converter;power control;engineering;ćuk converter;control theory	EDA	65.5652230702452	38.25277713893128	4261

Their new methodology assumes networks, rather than trees, as the correct model to capture the evolutionary history of natural languages. They proved the NP-hardness of the problem of testing whether a network is a perfect phylogenetic one for characters exhibiting at least three states, leaving open the case of binary characters, and gave a straightforward brute-force parameterized algorithm for the problem of running time O(3 k n), where k is the number of bidirectional edges in the network and n is its size. In this paper, we first establish the NP-hardness of the binary case of the problem. Then we provide a more efficient parameterized algorithm for this case running in time O(2 k n 2). The presented algorithm is very simple, and utilizes some structural results and elegant operations developed in this paper that can be useful on their own in the design of heuristic algorithms for the problem. The analysis phase of the algorithm is very elegant using amortized techniques to show that the upper bound on the running time of the algorithm is much tighter than the upper bound obtained under a conservative worst-case scenario assumption. Our results bear significant impact on reconstructing evolutionary histories of languages—particularly from phonological and morphological character data, most of which exhibit at most two states (i.e., are binary), as well as on the design and analysis of parameterized algorithms.	algorithm;amortized analysis;analysis of algorithms;best, worst and average case;bidirectional search;heuristic;np-hardness;natural language;phylogenesis;phylogenetic network;phylogenetics;time complexity;worst-case scenario	Iyad A.

16e47005b19a9ab6a796cee5d6b63ec2473d8736	a graph localization approach to assist a diver-in-distress		In this paper, we focus on the problem of locating a diver-in-distress using graph localization tools. Without GPS reception while being submerged, a diver cannot report on his location and upon distress can only rely on help from fellow divers by sending periodic SOS messages using underwater acoustic communication. In areas where many obstacles exist like harbors or shallow reefs, these SOS messages may not reach all the divers in place, and thus localization through triangulation is not guaranteed. Instead, we gather information of the propagation delay between the divers and use graph localization tools to allow a distributed evaluation of the location of the SOS source by an assisting diver. Considering the need to fastly propagate the SOS information, we flood the SOS packet while piggybacking propagation delay information across the divers' network. To combat the expected packet collisions, we evaluate the propagation delays by identifying the times collisions occur. When the assisting diver forms the graph of the propagation delays between the divers, he is able to estimate the location of the SOS source relative to his own using only a single anchor position. Numerical results as well as a proof-of-concept test in a water tank show a relative localization accuracy on the order of a few tens of meters, which is beneficial for quickly locate the diver-in-distress.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;apple sos;distress (novel);global positioning system;network packet;numerical linear algebra;numerical method;piggybacking (security);propagation delay;simulation;software propagation;sparse matrix;the times	Roee Diamant;Roberto Francescon;Michele Zorzi	2017	2017 14th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communications (WPNC)	10.1109/WPNC.2017.8250076	periodic graph (geometry);computer network;real-time computing;piggybacking (internet access);global positioning system;underwater acoustic communication;propagation delay;triangulation (social science);underwater acoustics;computer science;network packet	Mobile	18.85008623815012	77.3543682652291	4268

In earlier work we highlighted the deficiencies of the current approach and proposed the concept of the ldquodual transmission mode cellrdquo, in which P-t-P (DCH) and P-t-M (FACH) transmissions can coexist and allowed to dynamically adapt through time, to address them. In this paper we further analyze the deficiencies of the current 3GPP approach and enhance our previous work to efficiently address the problem in high mobility scenarios as well. The proposed algorithm takes into consideration both the distribution and the movement of the MBMS userspsila within the cell (using the CPICH Ec/No signal strength as a reference) and dynamically decides which MBMS users should be served using FACH and which should be served using DCH. Simulation results show significant transmission power savings, considerable reduction on the aggregated signaling and processing effort introduced, while QoS requirements are still fulfilled.	algorithm;coexist (image);fibre channel point-to-point;multimedia broadcast multicast service;multipoint ground;point-to-multipoint communication;quality of service;requirement;simulation	Christophoros Christophorou;Andreas Pitsillides;Vasos Vassiliou	2008	2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699607	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;multimedia broadcast multicast service;computer network	Arch	26.898419564393986	92.97866683277752	4274

The process of sampling is extremely important because it is the only one that connects the real world with the digital world. In addition, the proposed technique can be embedded into sensors, allowing applications in sensor networks and sensors data fusion architectures like Internet of Things. A simplified version of these algorithms has been proposed as a standard for transducer signal feature extraction.

It is shown that its solution depends continuously on the coefficients and the initial data. Two applications of this result are given: the convergence of solutions to equations with vanishing delay to the solution of equation without delay and the convergence of Euler approximations for mixed stochastic differential equations. As a side result of independent interest, the integrability of solution to mixed stochastic delay differential equations is established.	approximation;brownian motion;coefficient;euler method;euler–lagrange equation;hurst exponent	Yuliya Mishura;Taras Shalaiko;Georgiy Shevchenko	2015	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2015.01.019	mathematical optimization;examples of differential equations;euler method;mathematical analysis;stochastic differential equation;diffusion process;runge–kutta method;calculus;stochastic partial differential equation;linear differential equation;delay differential equation;mathematics;distributed parameter system;fractional brownian motion;differential equation;geometric brownian motion;statistics;order of accuracy	Theory	81.24219901134344	9.01373086133616	4282

Two schemes, priority enabled MAC (PE-MAC) and optimized PE-MAC are proposed to ensure real-time and reliable data delivery in emergency and feedback systems. These schemes use a dynamic priority mechanism to offer improved network reliability and timely communication for critical nodes. Both schemes offer a notable improvement in comparison to the IEEE 802.15.4e low-latency deterministic networks. To ensure more predictable communication reliability, two reliability centric schemes, quality-ensured scheme (QES) and priority integrated QES, are also proposed. These schemes maintain a pre-specified successful packet delivery rate, hence improving the overall network reliability and guaranteed channel access.

We introduce a new processing technique at relay for above case in order to achieve higher throughput and lower bit error rate (BER) than traditional schemes.

However, most of the previous localization approaches demand that sensors have plenty of resources like power, memory, or extra hardware used for ranging. In this paper we propose a new localization algorithm that accurately localizes sensors while minimizing power consumption and memory requirement of the sensors, and without depending on any extra hardware. Moreover, the proposed algorithm does not necessitate the presence of many nodes with preconfigured positions, or anchor nodes. In the proposed algorithm, anchors are placed in a circle or a semi-circle around the perimeter of the WSN. Not only this placement strategy leads to more accurate localization, but also it is very convenient for WSNs used for environment monitoring or military surveillance or tracking applications, since in these applications it is not convenient to deploy anchors in the middle of a hostile or enemy terrain.	algorithm;html element;hop;perimeter;semiconductor industry;sensor	Fawzi Yassine;Haïdar Safa	2009		10.1145/1710035.1710083	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Mobile	16.355105828570448	74.65909199425955	4302

The main advantage of the nonnegativity constraint is that the approximation problem becomes well posed. To tackle simultaneously these two problems, we suggest the use of a weighted least square cost function whose weights are gradually modified through the iterations. Moreover, the nonnegative nature of the loading matrices is taken into account directly in the problem parameterization. Then, the three gradient components can be explicitly derived allowing to efficiently implement the CP decomposition using standard optimization algorithms. In our case, we focus on the conjugate gradient and the BFGS algorithms. Finally, the good behaviour of the proposed approaches and their robustness versus possible model errors is illustrated through computer simulations in the context of data analysis.	approximation;broyden–fletcher–goldfarb–shanno algorithm;cholesky decomposition;computer simulation;conjugate gradient method;iteration;loss function;mathematical optimization;missing data;regular expression	Jean-Philip Royer;Nadège Thirion-Moreau;Pierre Comon	2012	2012 Proceedings of the 20th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;mathematics	ML	64.9221157671878	19.100359984526982	4310

This paper proposes an efficient error detection technique, called fingerprinting, that detects differences in execution across a dual modular redundant (DMR) processor pair. Fingerprinting summarizes a processor's execution history in a hash-based signature; differences between two mirrored processors are exposed by comparing their fingerprints. Fingerprinting tightly bounds detection latency and greatly reduces the interprocessor communication bandwidth required for checking. This paper presents a study that evaluates fingerprinting against a range of current approaches to error detection. The result of this study shows that fingerprinting is the only error detection mechanism that simultaneously allows high-error coverage, low error detection bandwidth, and high I/O performance.	bandwidth (signal processing);central processing unit;dual modular redundancy;error detection and correction;fingerprint (computing);input/output;inter-process communication;microprocessor;soft error	Jared C.

The condition numbers of finite element approximations of this model deteriorate badly as t approaches 0. An overlapping domain decomposition method for the Reissner–Mindlin plate model discretized by the Falk–Tu elements is developed. A modern overlapping method which uses the subdomain Schur complements to define coarse basis functions is used and it is shown that the condition number of this overlapping method is bounded by C(1 + H δ )3(1 + log H h )2 if t is smaller than or comparable to the element size h. Here H is the maximum diameter of the subdomains and δ is the size of overlap between the subdomains.

The Schroder numbers enumerate several combinatorial families, such as partitions of polygons. We describe here the family of planar rooted hypermaps with all vertices on the outer face, which is also enumerated by this sequence of numbers. We describe then a one-to-one correspondence between these hypermaps and partitions of polygons.

The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a promising candidate for such situations since it relies on simple algebraic operations and shows large potential for problem-specific adaptation. In this paper, we exploit structure in the controlled system by introducing virtual subsystems, which make it possible to customize ADMM and to utilize this structure. When applied to an appropriate system, the resulting algorithm shows (i) reduced computational cost, (ii) the opportunity for parallelization, (iii) better scalability, and (iv) overall improved convergence performance.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;augmented lagrangian method;computation;embedded system;linear algebra;mathematical optimization;parallel computing;scalability	Felix Rey;Peter Hokayem;John Lygeros	2017	2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2017.8264302	algebraic operation;mathematical optimization;ask price;computer science;scalability;control system;model predictive control;exploit;linear system;convergence (routing)	Robotics	31.67250830313845	6.467203341346437	4315

More precisely, for generating a uniformly random word of length n in a given regular language, our algorithm has worst-case space bit-complexity O(n) and mean time bit-complexity O(n). The previously best algorithm, due to Denise and Zimmermann (Theor. Comp. Sci. 218(2):233–248, 1999), has worst-case space bit-complexity O(n 2) and mean time bit-complexity O(nlog (n)). The Denise et al. algorithm was obtained by performing a floating-point optimization on the general recursive method formalized by Nijenhuis and Wilf (and further developed by Flajolet, Zimmermann and Van Cutsem). Our algorithm combines the floating-point optimization with a new divide-and-conquer scheme.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;context of computational complexity;mathematical optimization;original chip set;recursion;regular language;sampling (signal processing);μ-recursive function	Olivier Bernardi;Omer Giménez	2010	Algorithmica	10.1007/s00453-010-9446-5	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;regular language;computer science;mathematics;programming language;algorithm	Theory	7.957675708337467	22.969602351460725	4323

This includes zero-forcing (ZF), regularized ZF (RZF), and dirty-paper coding (DPC). As a reference for comparison, we consider subsectorization and time-division multiple access (TDMA). Outof-cell interference, treated as additive Gaussian noise, is included in two modes: 1) all cells transmit simultaneously and 2) neighboring cells transmit in alternated time slots. We find that ZF, RZF, and DPC can offer increases in spectral efficiency over subsectorization and TDMA by factors of ~4 under interference-limited conditions. This contrasts with the estimated gains of only ~2 when using a standard 3GPP mode instead of our measured data. This difference is due to the greater inter-cell isolation that characterizes our street-canyon-type test environment. We find that RZF achieves over 80% of the DPC's spectral efficiency under virtually all operating conditions.	deferred procedure call;deployment environment;gaussian blur;interference (communication);overhead (computing);regularized meshless method;spectral efficiency;superuser;system analysis;telecommunications link;throughput;utility functions on indivisible goods;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Flávio Oliveira Silva;Rodolfo Feick;Reinaldo A.

The aim of this paper is to propose a new parametric models able to describe both the spectral support and spatial structure of each component.	evanescent field;nsa product types;stochastic process	Youssef Stitou;Flavius Turcu;Mohamed Najim;Larbi Radouane	2004	2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;statistics	Vision	53.01839592665048	17.236515266563867	4332

If the latter condition is not satisfied , then we have a weak generalized n-gon. In this paper, we will always consider generalized n-gons with n 3 (generalized 2-gons are trivial geometries). They are the irreducible spherical buildings of rank 2. A generalized polygon is a generalized n-gon, for some n 2. We will view generalized polygons as geometries of rank 2 whose elements are points and lines. The dual is obtained by interchanging these names. A flag is an incident point-line pair and hence a chamber in the corresponding spherical rank 2 building. Generalized polygons were introduced by Tits [10] and are the basic rank 2 incidence geometries.	girth (graph theory);gon;graph (discrete mathematics);incidence matrix;irreducibility;line pair	Peter Abramenko;Hendrik Van Maldeghem	1999	Eur.

The importance of a fast response makes distributed strategies, where nodes exchange information just with their one-hop neighbors to reach local decisions, more adequate than schemes where all nodes send observations to a central entity. Distributed detectors are usually based on average consensus, where all nodes iteratively communicate to asymptotically agree on a final result. In a realistic scenario, communications are subject to random failures, which impacts the performance of the consensus. We propose an alternative detector, which adapts to the statistical properties of the consensus and compensate deviations from the average. Simulation results show that this adaptive detector improves the performance and approximates to the one of the optimal detector.	consensus (computer science);distributed shared memory;hop-by-hop transport;sensor;simulation	Daniel Alonso-Roman;Baltasar Beferull-Lozano	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472516	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Robotics	15.468476834004923	77.91173361626129	4344

We analyze a recently proposed approximate dynamic programming algorithm (ADP), which provides a computationally efficient solution to the associated multidimensional multimodal optimization problem. We quantify the error introduced by the approximations in ADP and deviations from the key local interaction signal model (LISMO) modeling assumption in two ways. First, we upper bound the difference between the exact minimum of the GSF criterion and its value at the ADP estimate and compare the ADP with GSF estimates obtained by exhaustive multidimensional search on a fine lattice. Second, motivated by the similar accuracy bounds, we use perturbation analysis to derive approximate expressions for the MSE of the ADP estimates. These various results provide, for the first time, an effective tool to predict the performance of the ADP algorithm for various signal models at nonasymptotic conditions of interest in practical applications. In particular, they demonstrate that for the classical problems of sinusoid retrieval and array processing, ADP performs comparably to exact (but expensive) maximum likelihood (ML) over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR’s) and is therefore an attractive algorithm.	akaike information criterion;algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;array processing;dynamic programming;estimation theory;evolutionary multimodal optimization;generic sensor format;mathematical optimization;multimodal interaction;optimization problem;perturbation theory;profiling (computer programming);signal-to-noise ratio;usb on-the-go	Sze Fong Yau;Yoram Bresler	2000	IEEE Trans.

We concentrate on distributed algorithms for determining a tree over the network topology, rooted at the source and spanning the intended destinations. Quality of Service requirements for interactive continuous media typically impose constraints on some metric over the individual paths from the source to each destination, usually in the form of an upper bound on the delay. Thus, we focus on the problem of minimizing the cost of the tree while at the same time satisfying a common constraint over individual source-destination paths. We have shown that this problem is intractable, but have also devised centralized polynomial time heuristics that perform well. Here we present distributed algorithms to minimize tree cost while satisfying the constraints on the paths from the source to each destination.	centralized computing;distributed algorithm;file spanning;heuristic (computer science);multicast;network topology;non-functional requirement;polynomial;quality of service;real-time transcription;routing;time complexity	Vachaspathi P.

f818015cc5445fdd7e5ccffb1fc3ccaea41b2a1e	a fast and scalable graph coloring algorithm for multi-core and many-core architectures	conference paper	Irregular computations on unstructured data are an important class of problems for parallel programming. Graph coloring is often an important preprocessing step, e.g. as a way to perform dependency analysis for safe parallel execution. The total run time of a coloring algorithm adds to the overall parallel overhead of the application whereas the number of colors used determines the amount of exposed parallelism. A fast and scalable coloring algorithm using as few colors as possible is vital for the overall parallel performance and scalability of many irregular applications that depend upon runtime dependency analysis. Çatalyürek et al. have proposed a graph coloring algorithm which relies on speculative, local assignment of colors. In this paper we present an improved version which runs even more optimistically with less thread synchronization and reduced number of conflicts compared to Çatalyürek et al.’s algorithm. We show that the new technique scales better on multicore and many-core systems and performs up to 1.5x faster than its predecessor on graphs with high-degree vertices, while keeping the number of colors at the same near-optimal levels.	color;computation;dependence analysis;emoticon;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;greedy algorithm;image scaling;iteration;manycore processor;multi-core processor;optimistic concurrency control;overhead (computing);parallel algorithm;parallel computing;preprocessor;run time (program lifecycle phase);scalability;speculative execution;synchronization (computer science);vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Georgios Rokos;Gerard Gorman;Paul H.

Two problem decomposition techniques are discussed: dimension splitting for promoting parallelization in chemical transport models, and time splitting, for reducing truncation error. Additionally, a scalable method for accessing random rows or columns of a matrix of arbitrary size from the accelerator units of the Cell Broadband Engine is presented. This scalable access method increases chemical transport model efficiency by an average of 30% and significantly improves the scalability of dimension-splitting techniques on the Cell Broadband Engine. Experiments show that chemical transport models are 31% more efficient on the Cell Broadband Engine when only six accelerator units are used than on a shared-memory multiprocessor with eight executing cores. Our fully-optimized models achieve an average 118% speedup on the Cell Broadband Engine, and an average 87.5% speedup on a shared-memory multiprocessor with OpenMP.	cell (microprocessor);central processing unit;chemical transport model;chemical transport reaction;column (database);multi-core processor;multiprocessing;openmp;optimizing compiler;parallel computing;scalability;shared memory;speedup;truncation error	John C.

The graph G is δ-hyperbolic provided for any vertices x, y, u, v in it, the two larger of the three sums d(u, v) + d(x, y), d(u, x) + d(v, y) and d(u, y) + d(v, x) differ by at most 2δ. The graph G is k-chordal provided it has no induced cycle of length greater than k. Brinkmann, Koolen and Moulton find that every 3-chordal graph is 1-hyperbolic and that graph is not 12 -hyperbolic if and only if it contains one of two special graphs as an isometric subgraph. For every k ≥ 4, we show that a k-chordal graph must be ⌊ 2 ⌋ 2 -hyperbolic and there does exist a k-chordal graph which is not ⌊ 2 ⌋ 2 -hyperbolic. Moreover, we prove that a 5-chordal graph is 12 -hyperbolic if and only if it does not contain any of a list of five special graphs as an isometric subgraph.	connectivity (graph theory);emoticon;induced path;isometric projection;shortest path problem	Yaokun Wu;Chengpeng Zhang	2011	Electr.

These measures consider the number of communication steps, communication rules and total energy used per communication step, respectively. In this paper, we address a previous conjecture that states that only semilinear sets can be generated with bounded ComX, (X in {N,R,W}). Our result on bounded ComW seems to support such conjecture while the conjecture is not true for bounded ComN and ComR. We also show that the class of recursively enumerable sets can be computed using ECPe systems with two membranes. This improves a previous result that makes use of four membranes to show computational completeness.	p system	Richelle Ann B. Juayong;Nestine Hope S. Hernandez;Francis George Cabarle;Kelvin C.

This is possible when such dynamics can be programmed, controlled, and observed. In this talk, we will present some of our work where we are exploring the timeevolution of both deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems in both CMOS and post-CMOS computing substrates. Such systems find applications in solving inverse problems, distributed optimizations (convex and combinatorial) and machine learning. In this paper we will discuss our recent work that connects dynamics and algebraic graph theory. We will talk about implementation of such dynamics in mixed-signal CMOS, including a recent demonstration of reinforcement learning for energy-constrained edge devices. We will conclude with a brief discussion of the opportunities, potentials and challenges in realizing such computational systems.

To avoid long test times caused by large output cones, partial pseudo-exhaustive test (P-PET) has been proposed recently. Here only cones with a limited number of inputs are tested exhaustively, and the remaining faults are targeted with deterministic patterns. Using P-PET patterns for built-in diagnosis, however, is challenging because of the large amount of associated response data. This paper presents a built-in diagnosis scheme which only relies on sparsely distributed data in the response sequence, but still preserves the benefits of P-PET.	autonomous robot;canonical account;combinational logic;logic gate;microsoft windows;polyethylene terephthalate;requirement;software bug	Alejandro Cook;Sybille Hellebrand;Michael E.

GPRS/EDGE codecs require better quality channels to support higher data throughput, i.e. channels with lower collision rates and better average carrier-to-interference ratio (CII). With the continuing growth of mobile data traffic, networks must improve channel quality in a compact re-use environment. To achieve this, we recommend the introduction of timing synchronisation for base stations (BS) in a GSM/GPRS/EDGE network. Our analysis shows that BS synchronisation leads to a reduction in collision rates that can be exploited for either C/I or capacity improvement. More importantly, we propose timing groups (TG) for a synchronized network. In conjunction with frequency planning, TG offers greater flexibility in network design by providing superior quality channels to a category of users without dividing the available spectrum into carrier groups with different re-use schemes	codec;interference (communication);network planning and design;throughput	Maxim Gitlits;Jackson Yin;Paul Kubik	2006	2006 IEEE 63rd Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2006.1683011	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;base station;computer network	Mobile	24.458989535509335	86.71228528153884	4423

Using a successive interference cancellation (SIC) and a Gauss-Jordan elimination process, receivers can recover their original packets. We derive expressions for the total packet success probability for the case of NOMA (or OMA) with (or without) RLNC, and propose group based power allocation schemes in order to improve performance with a low overhead. Through the results of simulations, we verify our derivations and show that RLNC based on NOMA improves the packet success probability and decreases the packet delay.	bell laboratories layered space-time;interference (communication);linear network coding;multicast;multiplexing;network packet;oma;overhead (computing);power domains;simplified instructional computer;simulation;telecommunications link;transmitter	Sungjin Park;Dong-Ho Cho	2015	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2436392	linear network coding;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;signal-to-noise ratio;multiplexing;wireless;computer network	Networks	33.989639229611235	77.79744357743508	4429

The all-terminal reliability is a polynomial in qq whose roots (all-terminal reliability roots  ) were conjectured to have modulus at most 11 by Brown and Colbourn. Royle and Sokal proved the conjecture false, finding roots of modulus larger than 11 by a slim margin. Here, we present the first nontrivial upper bound on the modulus of any all-terminal reliability root, in terms of the number of vertices of the graph. We also find all-terminal reliability roots of larger modulus than any previously known. Finally, we consider the all-terminal reliability roots of simple graphs; we present the smallest known simple graph with all-terminal reliability roots of modulus greater than 11, and we find simple graphs with all-terminal reliability roots of modulus greater than 11 that have higher edge connectivity than any previously known examples.	polynomial	Jason Brown;Lucas Mol	2017	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2017.01.024	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;properties of polynomial roots;mathematics;algebra	Theory	23.731831240863066	33.56528867693964	4431

Further, let m(G) = maxF⊆G |E(F )|/|V (F )| and define the Ramsey density minf (H, r) as the infimum of m(G) over all graphs G such that G → (H, r). In the first part of this paper we show that when H is a complete graph Kk on k vertices, then minf (H, r) = (R − 1)/2, where R = R(k; r) is the classical Ramsey number. As a corollary we derive a new proof of the result credited to Chvatál that the size Ramsey number for Kk equals ( R 2 ) . We also study an on-line version of the size Ramsey number, related to the following two-person game: Painter colors on-line the edges provided by Builder, and Painter’s goal is to avoid a monochromatic copy of Kk. The on-line Ramsey number R(k; r) is the smallest number of moves (edges) in which Builder can force Painter to lose if r colors are available. We show that R(3; 2) = 8 and R(k; 2) ≤ 2k(2k−2 k−1 ) , but leave unanswered the question if R(k; 2) = o(R(k; 2)).	color;corel painter;graph coloring;monochrome;online and offline;ramsey's theorem	Andrzej Kurek;Andrzej Rucinski	2005	Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory	10.7151/dmgt.1268	combinatorics;ramsey's theorem	Theory	29.032111262467744	24.716170505165426	4449

This optimization problem is solved subject to a set of constraints. Previous research has suggested a minimum guaranteed quality of service plus bounds on individual transmission powers and the aggregate transmitted power as the constraints. Solving this problem, it is found out that the solution is very prone to including one station which transmits at a rate a hundred times as much as the others. Thus, it is concluded that the above constraints are not enough to produce a solution which can be realized in an actual system. It is suggested that lack of any constraint which explicitly controls either the maximum capacity of each station or the unfairness of the whole system is responsible for this shortcoming. In this paper, we include a maximum capacity constraint into the formulation and propose an algorithm for solving the resulting optimization problem. Then, empirical evidence are analyzed to show that the system actually becomes more balanced and practical after the new constraint is added to it.	alfa (xacml);adaptive binary optimization;aggregate data;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;constraint (mathematics);information theory;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;quality of service;regular expression;simulation;telecommunications link	Arash Abadpour;Attahiru Sule Alfa;Anthony C.

One explanation is the highly directional transmission in mmWave, which reduces the interference caused by one network on the other networks sharing the same resources. In this paper, we model a mmWave cellular system where an operator that primarily owns an exclusive-use license of a certain band can sell a restricted secondary license of the same band to another operator. This secondary network has a restriction on the maximum interference it can cause to the original network. Using stochastic geometry, we derive expressions for the coverage and rate of both networks, and establish the feasibility of secondary licensing in licensed mmWave bands. Results show that the restricted secondary operator can achieve good coverage with a small impact on the original operator. Our results also illustrate that the spectrum sharing gains increase with narrow beams and when the network densifies.	interference (communication)	Abhishek K. Gupta;Ahmed Alkhateeb;Jeffrey G.

2b0f5a26c8d84dd7e1ab9e2261ae4ce81aef9e99	studying vertical dependence to improve nfs performance in wireless networks	physical layer;wireless network;network file system;mobile environment	Wireless networks experience a high level of errors and losses. These physical layer characteristics have an impact on the performance of the higher layers. In addition, the performance of each protocol layer is contingent on the behavior of the other layers. Vertical dependency is a term which describes this inter-dependence between layers. In the wireless and mobile environment, the effects of vertical dependence are particularly pronounced due to the dynamic nature of the environment and due to the fact that traditional assumptions about protocol layer interactions do not always hold. In this paper, we consider the vertical dependencies between various layers in the protocol stack, studying the performance of the Network File System under various error models and improvement techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate the dependency of the application performance on the details of the error characteristics and other protocol layers. After studying the vertical dependencies, we improve NFS performance by implementing changes to the application level reliability mechanisms. Understanding of the vertical dependencies enables development of effective methods for performance enhancement and efficient reaction to errors and changes on the wireless media.	algorithm;contingency (philosophy);effective method;high-level programming language;information exchange;interaction;network congestion;protocol stack;retransmission (data networks);stationary process;subnetwork	Cynthia D.

Belief propagation (BP) algorithm, as one o f the popular approaches for decoding polar codes, has unique advantage of high parallelism but suffers from high computation complexity, which translates to very large silicon area and high power consumption. This paper, for the first time, exploits the design of polar BP decoder using stochastic computing. Several methods ranging from algorithm level to architecture level are presented to improve the error and hardware performances of the stochastic BP decoder. The approaches proposed in this work provide a potential low-cost solution for stochastic BP decoder design.	algorithm;backpropagation;belief propagation;coding theory;computation;parallel computing;performance;polar code (coding theory);provable security;software propagation;stochastic computing;stochastic gradient descent	Bo Yuan;Keshab K.

Such buffers offer potential as components of communication, transportation, and manufacturing networks because, unlike in the usual buffer model with fixed drain rate (in which overflow and loss are inevitable with standard input models), responsive buffers may or may not exhibit overflow. A simple condition characterizing losslessness in responsive buffers is given. The stationary buffer backlog distribution of lossless responsive buffers subject to a maximally bursty on–off input process is shown to be related to the beta distribution, and under the same conditions, overflow in lossy responsive buffers is shown generally to be exponentially distributed. An important special case of responsive buffers is considered, a linear filter dubbed the leaky bladder. The linearity of the leaky bladder enables us to determine its mean delay and relative smoothing.	responsive web design	Michael Frey	2006	J.

Particularly, body area networks, as a typical computing environment application in healthcare, allow ubiquitous monitoring of patients, and more thorough patient diagnoses can be done with the help of multimedia service. In this work, we propose a novel media-aware flow scheduling architecture with the aims of improving the multimedia quality and increasing the networku0027s lifetime. In order to avoid interfering with the multimedia applicationsu0027 delay requirements, this work also proposes to analyze frames delay and jitter. The proposal has proven to improve the multimedia quality and decrease the transmission delay in a controllable manner, and thus the tradeoffs between QoS, lifetime, and delay requirements can be achieved according to the considered scenario. In addition, extensive simulation results validates the efficiency of the proposed method.	cloud computing;scheduling (computing)	Joel Jos&#x00E9; P. C. Rodrigues;Liang Zhou;Lucas D. P.

1322cc558f186d42996babd0ae4f4d677616b4de	ctll: a cell-based transfer learning method for localization in large scale wireless sensor networks	期刊论文	Localization is emerging as a fundamental component in wireless sensor network and is widely used in the field of environmental monitoring, national and military defense, transportation monitoring, and so on. Current localization methods, however, focus on how to improve accuracy without considering the robustness. Thus, the error will increase rapidly when nodes density and SNR (signal to noise ratio) have changed dramatically. This paper introduces CTLL, Cell-Based Transfer Learning Method for Localization in WSNs, a new way for localization which is robust to the variances of nodes density and SNR. The method combines samples transfer learning and SVR (Support Vector Regression) regression model to get a better performance of localization. Unlike past work, which considers that the nodes density and SNR are invariable, our design applies regional division and transfer learning to adapt to the variances of nodes density and SNR. We evaluate the performance of our method both on simulation and realistic deployment. The results show that our method increases accuracy and provides high robustness under a low cost.

beae5338fbe29ecb1fc493e4914bde365119b6d1	memory-full context-aware predictive mobility management in dual connectivity 5g networks		Network densification with small cell deployment is being considered as one of the dominant themes in the fifth generation (5G) cellular system. Despite the capacity gains, such deployment scenarios raise several challenges from mobility management perspective. The small cell size, which implies a small cell residence time, will increase the handover (HO) rate dramatically. Consequently, the HO latency will become a critical consideration in the 5G era. The latter requires an intelligent, fast, and light-weight HO procedure with minimal signaling overhead. In this direction, we propose a memory-full context-aware HO scheme with mobility prediction to achieve the aforementioned objectives. We consider a dual connectivity radio access network architecture with logical separation between control and data planes because it offers relaxed constraints in implementing the predictive approaches. The proposed scheme predicts future HO events along with the expected HO time by combining radio frequency performance to physical proximity along with the user context in terms of speed, direction, and HO history. To minimize the processing and the storage requirements whilst improving the prediction performance, a user-specific prediction triggering threshold is proposed. The prediction outcome is utilized to perform advance HO signaling whilst suspending the periodic transmission of measurement reports. Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme provides promising gains over the conventional approach.	angularjs;compaq lte;direct-broadcast satellite;fifth generation computer;hysteresis;network architecture;overhead (computing);radio access network;radio frequency;requirement;scheme;simulation;software deployment;sound quality;time series;unreal development kit;while	Abdelrahim Mohamed;Muhammad Ali Imran;Pei Xiao;Rahim Tafazolli	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2796579	latency (engineering);handover;residence time;software deployment;computer network;computer science;architecture;radio frequency;radio access network;mobility management	Mobile	23.03221000229459	89.79415864613868	4482

Comparing with the known “universal switch modules,” where only 2-pin nets are considered, the hyper-universal switch box model is more general and powerful. This paper studies the generic problem and proposes a systematic designing methodology for hyper-universal ðk;W Þ-switch boxes, where k is the number of sides and W is the number of terminals on each side. We formulate this hyper-universal ðk;WÞ-switch box design problem as a k-partite graph design problem and propose an efficient reduction design technique. Applying this technique, we can design hyper-universal ðk;W Þ-switch boxes with low OðWÞ switches for any fixed k. For illustration, we provide optimum hyper-universal ð2;W Þ and ð3;W Þ-switch boxes and a hyper-universal ð4;WÞ-switch box with switch number quite close to the lower bound 6W , which is used in a well-known commercial design without hyper-universal routability. We also conclude that the proposed reduction method can yield an efficient detailed routing algorithm for any given routing requirement as well.	algorithm;field-programmable gate array;graph theory;kvm switch;network switch;reduction (complexity);routing;symmetric multiprocessing;talk box	Hongbing Fan;Jiping Liu;Yu-Liang Wu	2003	IEEE Trans.

In the process, we clarify the origin of their relations and the properties of this formulation. We also investigate the extension of their form to nonuniform grids. We show the strict conservation form only extends to grids with quadratic or exponential stretching. However, a slight generalization can be applied to all smoothly stretched grids with no loss of essential properties.	discretization;essence;finite difference;geodesic grid;numerical method;smoothing;standard cell;tian yuan shu;time complexity	Barry Merriman	2003	J.

DualSPHysics is an open-source code that provides GP-GPU acceleration, allowing for highly refined simulations. The automatic optimization framework combines the global-convergence capabilities of a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) with Response Surface Method (RSM) based on a Kriging approximation. The proposed Metamodel-Embedded Evolutionary framework is used to find the set of SPH model parameters that ensures an accurate reproduction of a 2 n d order Stokes wave propagating in a numeric flume tank. In order to demonstrate the consistency of the obtained results, the optimum set of parameters found by the framework is finally used to reproduce other 2 n d and 3 r d order Stokes waves propagating over the same flume tank.	genetic algorithm;numerical stability;response surface methodology;software propagation	Riccardo Angelini Rota Roselli;Giuliano Vernengo;Corrado Altomare;Stefano Brizzolara;Luca Bonfiglio;Roberto Guercio	2018	Environmental Modelling and Software	10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.02.003	acceleration;computational physics;hydrology;wave propagation;genetic algorithm;computer science;stokes wave;wind wave;numerical stability;kriging;solver	Robotics	92.48219698994899	11.96063921180958	4492

2a9472ff5d3960c9c0080d354c42f835faddf1cf	multidimensional sampling of isotropically bandlimited signals		A new lower bound on the average reconstruction error variance of multidimensional sampling and reconstruction is presented. It applies to sampling on arbitrary lattices in arbitrary dimensions, assuming a stochastic process with constant, isotropically bandlimited spectrum and reconstruction by the best linear interpolator. The lower bound is exact for any lattice at sufficiently high and low sampling rates. The two threshold rates where the error variance deviates from the lower bound gives two optimality criteria for sampling lattices. It is proved that at low rates, near the first threshold, the optimal lattice is the dual of the best sphere-covering lattice, which for the first time establishes a rigorous relation between optimal sampling and optimal sphere covering. A previously known result is confirmed at high rates, near the second threshold, namely, that the optimal lattice is the dual of the best sphere-packing lattice. Numerical results quantify the performance of various lattices for sampling and support the theoretical optimality criteria.	bandlimiting;classical limit;line graph;multidimensional sampling;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;nyquist rate;sampling (signal processing);set packing;stochastic process	Erik Agrell;Balázs Csébfalvi	2018	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2017.2720143	mathematical optimization;mathematics;multidimensional signal processing;nyquist rate;sampling (statistics);multidimensional sampling;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;stochastic process;bandwidth (signal processing);upper and lower bounds	Theory	41.52107107299792	17.57271139742275	4511

For computational efficiency conservative multi-tracer semi-Lagrangian type transport schemes are appropriate. Global models based on high-order Galerkin approach employ highly non-uniform spectral-element grids, and semi-Lagrangian transport is a challenge on those grids. A conservative semi-Lagrangian scheme (SPELT - SPectral-Element Lagrangian Transport) employing a multi-moment compact reconstruction procedure is developed for non-uniform quadrilateral grids. The scheme is based on a characteristic semi-Lagrangian method that avoids complex and expensive upstream area computations. The SPELT scheme has been implemented in the High-Order Method Modeling Environment (HOMME), which is based on a cubed-sphere grid with spectral-element spatial discretization. Additionally, we show the (strong) scalability and multi-tracer efficiency using several benchmark tests. The SPELT solution can be made monotonic (positivity preserving) by combining the flux-corrected transport algorithm, which is demonstrated on a uniform resolution grid. In particular, SPELT can be efficiently used for non-uniform grids and provides accurate and stable results for high-resolution meshes.	geodesic grid	Christoph Erath;Ramachandran D. Nair	2014	J.

A unit disk graph is a graph in which each vertex corresponds to a unit disk in the plane and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their disks have a non-empty intersection. We present the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for the minimum-weight dominating set problem in unit disk graphs, a problem motivated by applications in wireless ad-hoc networks. The algorithm is obtained in two steps: First, the problem is reduced to the problem of covering a set of points located in a small square using a minimumweight set of unit disks. Then, a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the latter problem is obtained using enumeration and dynamic programming techniques exploiting the geometry of unit disks. Furthermore, we show how to obtain a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the minimum-weight connected dominating set problem in unit disk graphs. Our techniques also yield a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the weighted disk cover problem (covering a set of points in the plane with unit disks of minimum total weight) and a 3-approximation algorithm for the weighted forwarding set problem (covering a set of points in the plane with weighted unit disks whose centers are all contained in a given unit disk).	apx;approximation algorithm;connected dominating set;dynamic programming;graph (discrete mathematics);hoc (programming language);ptas reduction;polynomial;time complexity;unit disk graph;vertex (geometry)	Christoph Ambühl;Thomas Erlebach;Matús Mihalák;Marc Nunkesser	2006		10.1007/11830924_3	wireless ad hoc network;mathematical optimization;unit disk graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;feedback arc set;independent set;bidimensionality;feedback vertex set;bipartite graph;dominating set;vertex cover;combinatorial optimization;degree;metric k-center;graph theory;metric dimension;cycle graph;vertex;connected dominating set;mathematics;distributed computing;maximal independent set;domatic number;indifference graph;approximation algorithm;neighbourhood;algorithm;matching	Theory	22.230127558909583	28.69715073094492	4518

This salesperson has a map (a weighted graph) in which each city has an attached demand specifying the number of brushes that can be sold in that city. What is the best route to take to sell the quota while traveling the least distance possible? Notice that unlike the standard traveling salesman problem, not only do we need to gure out the order in which to visit the cities, but we must decide the more fundamental question: which cities do we want to visit? In this paper we give the rst approximation algorithms with poly-logarithmic performance guarantees for this problem, as well as for the slightly more general PCTSP problem of Balas, and a variation we call the \bank-robber problem"""" (also called the \orienteering problem"""" by Golden, Levi, and Vohra). We do this by providing an O(log2 k) approximation to the k-MST problem which is de ned as follows. Given an undirected graph on n nodes with non-negative edge weights and an integer k n, nd the tree of least weight that spans k vertices. (If desired, one may specify in the problem a \root vertex"""" that must be in the tree as well.) Our result improves on the previous best bound of O(pk) of Ravi et al. and comes quite close to the bound of O(log k) of Garg and Hochbaum for the special case of points in 2-dimensional Euclidean space."""	approximation algorithm;graph (discrete mathematics);travelling salesman problem	Baruch Awerbuch;Yossi Azar;Avrim Blum;Santosh Vempala	1995		10.1145/225058.225139	edge;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;fault tree analysis;computer science;computation;mathematics;node;graph;algorithm;bottleneck traveling salesman problem	Theory	24.461897923167722	17.783724304772623	4520

90a50c60b7edccc6cb81bcd19a377dba3be6df51	a forwarding pointer-based cache scheme for reducing location management cost in pcs networks	personal communication service;location management;call to mobility ratio;mobile user	This paper proposes a forwarding pointer-based cache scheme (PB-Cache scheme) that can reduce the signaling cost for location management in PCS networks. In the existing cache scheme, the use of cache information can effectively reduce the signaling traffic for locating frequently called mobile users. However, when the cache information is obsolete, it results in much more signaling traffic than that of the IS-41. In order to solve this problem, we propose a new location cache scheme called the PB-Cache scheme, which exploits a user’s movement locality as well as call locality. Even if the cached information is not up-to-date, the called user can be found by tracing forwarding pointers starting from that VLR pointed in the cache instead of querying the HLR. Thus, the PB-Cache scheme can effectively reduce the frequent access to the HLR and the signaling traffic for location management. Moreover, it distributes the signaling and database access load on the HLR to the VLR’s. Analytical results indicate that the PB-Cache scheme significantly outperforms the other schemes when a user’s call-to-mobility ratio is high or the signaling traffic to the HLR is heavy.	algorithm;cpu cache;hidden line removal;locality of reference;pointer (computer programming)	Ki-Sik Kong;Joon-Min Gil;Youn-Hee Han;Ui-Sung Song;Chong-Sun Hwang	2002	J.

The goal is to provide satisfactory quality of service (QoS) to both real-time and non-real-time applications, despite the rapid variations in available resources caused by the activities of the primary users. The dynamic nature of the available spectrum gives rise to two resource allocation issues: 1) problem feasibility and 2) false urgency. To solve the problem-feasibility issue, which arises when resources are insufficient to meet all user QoS requirements, we adopt a goal-programming approach. The false-urgency issue that was caused by variations in available system resources is effectively avoided by a proposed rate-requirement calculation mechanism based on the status of the packets in queue and system resource availability. Simulation results show that the proposed cross-layer resource-allocation algorithm for CR systems performs better than existing algorithms that were designed for multiuser OFDM systems.	algorithm;cognitive radio;goal programming;multi-user;multiplexing;quality of service;real-time clock;requirement;simulation	Yonghong Zhang;Cyril Leung	2009	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2009.2020801	electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer network	Embedded	33.02153822075901	89.99020863142775	4546

Optimization Methods and Software, 17, 869-889.], we describe a QR-based nullspace factorization of KKT matrices. We illustrate the linear algebra in detail and present a theory for maintaining factorized matrices after low-rank updates. Each update of the whole system is incorporated with a computational effort that grows only quadratically with respect to the number of variables and active constraints. Furthermore, our method is special in making use of quasi-Newton updates for the constraint Jacobian approximation, instead of the usual way of using the exact derivative or divided differences. To avoid singularity or blow-up of the KKT matrix, we limit the variations of its determinant to a certain factor and dampen or augment the updates if necessary. We maintain the reduced Hessian positive definite, so that the resulting quasi-Newton steps in the primal and dual variables are downhill for suitably weighted merit functions.	karush–kuhn–tucker conditions	Andreas Griewank;Andrea Walther;Maciek Korzec	2007	Optimization Methods and Software	10.1080/10556780500487867	mathematical optimization;constrained optimization;mathematical analysis;quasi-newton method;linear algebra;calculus;mathematics;positive-definite matrix;divided differences;qr decomposition	Logic	77.77601146975242	24.296878960694876	4578

This paper proposes a heterogeneous implementation of optical space switches based on two gating elements, amplifiers such as semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) and modulators such as Mach-Zehnder modulators. The heterogenous implementation has the advantage of being more power-efficient than a homogeneous implementation based only on SOAs and more scalable than a homogeneous implementation based only on modulator-based gates as the optical power loss can be compensated by the SOAs. The paper derives the requirements in number of gating elements for different space switch architectures (i.e., crossbar, Beneš, Spanke, Clos, Spanke-Benes, and hybrid Clos). Based on the such derivation, the scalability and the power-efficiency of the different non-blocking architectures with heterogeneous design are assessed, with the aim at identifying the most suitable architecture based on today's available optical technologies. Results show that power saving around 80% are achievable when using a heterogeneous implementation instead of a homogenous SOA-based implementation.	blocking (computing);clos network;conley–zehnder theorem;crossbar switch;interconnection;modulation;network switch;non-blocking algorithm;optical amplifier;requirement;routing;scalability;semiconductor;service-oriented architecture;traverse	Pier Giorgio Raponi;Nicola Andriolli;Isabella Cerutti;Piero Castoldi;Odile Liboiron-Ladouceur	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6363696	electrical efficiency;energy conservation;logic gate;telecommunications;computer science;service-oriented architecture;optical switch;optical amplifier	HPC	3.7123359933055227	60.46925951586348	4593

The ubiquity of the nonlocal operator is illustrated by a number of applications ranging from continuum mechanics to graph theory. These applications elucidate different interpretations of the operator and the governing equation. A probabilistic perspective explains that the nonlocal operator corresponds to the infinitesimal generator for a symmetric jump process. Sufficient conditions on the kernel of the operator and the notion of volume constraints lead to a well-posed problem. The volume constraints are a proxy for boundary conditions that may not be defined for the given kernel. In particular, we demonstrate for a general class of kernels that the nonlocal operator is a mapping between a constrained subspace of a fractional Sobolev subspace and its dual. We also demonstrate for some other kernels the operator’s inverse does not smooth but does correspond to diffusion. The impact of our analyses is that both a continuum analysis and a numerical method for the modeling of anomalous diffusion on bounded domains in R are provided. The analytical framework also allows us to consider finite dimensional approximations using both discontinuous or continuous Galerkin methods that are conforming for the nonlocal diffusion equation; error and condition number estimates are derived. The nonlocal vector calculus enables striking analogies to be drawn with the problem of classical diffusion including a notion of nonlocal flux.	aharonov–bohm effect;approximation;condition number;galerkin method;graph theory;krylov subspace;nonlocal lagrangian;numerical method;proxy server;quantum nonlocality;triune continuum paradigm;variational analysis;well-posed problem	Qiang Du;Max Gunzburger;Richard B.

In this work, the FDTD method is applied at optical wavelengths. More precisely, we present the results obtained using the FDTD algorithm to simulate the performance of optical devices such as volume diffraction gratings. The Perfectly Matched Layers (PML), Total-Field Scattered-Field formulation (TF/SF) and Near-Field to Far-Field transformation (NF/FF) are some add-ons included in order to correctly calculate the far field distribution obtained from the numerical near-field values computed in the simulation region. These values in the near-field region are computed by illuminating the grating with of a plane wave at the Bragg angle of incidence. In addition, we compare the results obtained by the FDTD method to those obtained using the Rigorous Coupled Wave Theory (RCWT) applied to diffraction gratings. As will be seen in this paper there is good agreement between the two approaches, thus validating our FDTD implementation.	angularjs;computation;finite-difference time-domain method;holographic principle;holography;interference (communication);numerical analysis;requirement;software propagation	Jorge Francés;Cristian Neipp;Manuel Pérez-Molina;Augusto Beléndez	2010	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2010.09.005	finite-difference time-domain method;plane wave;diffraction grating;perfectly matched layer;near and far field;diffraction efficiency;optics;holography;physics	Logic	90.86597678602192	6.308704401158437	4614

More specifically, we extend the definition of outage capacity to account for the secrecy constraint and obtain sharp characterizations of the corresponding fundamental limits under two different assumptions on the transmitter channel state information (CSI). First, we find the outage secrecy capacity assuming that the transmitter has perfect knowledge of the legitimate and eavesdropper channel gains. In this scenario, the capacity achieving scheme relies on opportunistically exchanging private keys between the legitimate nodes. These keys are stored in a key buffer and later used to secure delay sensitive data using the Vernam's one time pad technique. We then extend our results to the more practical scenario where the transmitter is assumed to know only the legitimate channel gain. Here, our achievability arguments rely on privacy amplification techniques to generate secret key bits. In the two cases, we also characterize the optimal power control policies which, interestingly, turn out to be a judicious combination of channel inversion and the optimal ergodic strategy. Finally, we analyze the effect of key buffer overflow on the overall outage probability.	sun outage	Onur Güngör;Jian Tan;Can Emre Koksal;Hesham El Gamal;Ness B. Shroff	2013	IEEE Trans.

The study focuses on the practical aspects of deployment, data gathering and retrieval events. The trial sensor network was used to retrieve temperature and illuminance data from the seabed of Moreton Bay, Australia. The application described possesses features and implements technical solutions that distinguish it from previous deployments. For example, the particular mooring system maintains the buoys horizontal on the water's surface even in strong tidal current conditions, thus enabling reliable communication at 2.4 GHz. In this application, the underwater sensors were wired to surface wireless nodes, and this arrangement led to various difficulties in the network's deployment, maintenance and retrieval phases. For this reason, the knowledge acquired through this experience is presented in this paper to provide insight into, and to further stress, the importance of using fully wireless systems in monitoring applications for the marine environment.	sensor;software deployment	Umberto M.

f1c20cf32c0bc4a4ce66ba8d495c4809753fee3f	providing primary frequency control with residential scale photovoltaic-battery systems		Decentralized photovoltaic (PV) battery systems have recently received great attention from consumers around the world. PV battery systems allow consumers to reduce their dependence on the local electricity supplier at lower or equivalent costs. However, the profitability of PV battery systems depends greatly on the local meteorological conditions and the local electricity retail tariff. In central European countries, PV battery systems generate and store less electricity in winter months due to lower irradiation. The battery, in particular, can be reserved to provide ancillary services during winter months and thereby improves the overall systems economics. In this study, a large dataset consisting of individual load profiles is used to simulate a virtual power plant which provides ancillary services during battery idle times. The results show that participants with large batteries can greatly increase their overall systems economics by participating in reserve markets. However, participants with small battery capacities may not be able to recover the additional costs for communication with the virtual power plant and are thus not suitable candidates to provide grid stabilizing services (ancillary services).	page view;simulation	Sandro Schopfer;Verena Tiefenbeck;Elgar Fleisch;Thorsten Staake	2016	Computer Science - Research and Development	10.1007/s00450-016-0318-3	simulation;stand-alone power system	AI	2.128129882838237	5.222234642233588	4644

The proposed detector is derived from the sum-product (SP) algorithm and the factor graph (FG) framework, and performs approximate maximum a posteriori bit detection. A convenient FG of the actual MU detection problem is considered, rather than only FGs of the individual single-user detection problems combined with ad-hoc inter-user interference cancellation. A suitable set of SP messages is approximated by a Gaussian distribution; this considerably reduces the computational complexity and memory size requirements as compared to a straightforward application of the SP rules. The resulting algorithm succeeds in achieving a good error performance.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;computational complexity theory;factor graph;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);iterative method;job control (unix);modulation;multi-user;requirement;spectral efficiency;utility functions on indivisible goods;iui	Nele Noels;Marc Moeneclaey	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214503	additive white gaussian noise;mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;approximation algorithm;statistics	Mobile	46.8079679681112	74.23987021855007	4648

However, because such nodes increase the amount of sensory data, some nodes (especially near the sink) may blackout because more transmitted data can make relaying nodes expend more energy. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware control scheme of data compression and sensing rate to maximize the amount of data collected at the sink, while minimizing the blackout time. In this scheme, each dominant node determines the data quota that all its descendant nodes can transmit during the next period, which operates with an efficient energy allocation scheme. Then, the node receiving the quota selects an appropriate data compression algorithm and sensing rate according to both its quota and allocated energy during the next period, so as not to exhaust the energy of nodes near the sink. Experimental results verify that the proposed scheme collects more data than other schemes, while suppressing the blackout of nodes. We also found that it adapts better to changes in node density and harvesting environments.	allocation;anatomic node;data compression;download;node - plant part;rechargeable battery;algorithm;disease transmission	Ikjune Yoon;Dong Kun Noh	2018		10.3390/s18082609	wireless sensor network;electronic engineering;engineering;data compression;wireless	Mobile	11.27103087424299	80.44397699836018	4651

0b2ec881cbc24064598a89127dde4293b9e0b91b	a note on semi-algebraic proofs and gaussian elimination over prime fields		In this note we show that unsatisfiable systems of linear equations with a constant number of variables per equation over prime finite fields have polynomial-size constant-degree semi-algebraic proofs of unsatisfiability. These are proofs that manipulate polynomial inequalities over the reals with variables ranging in {0, 1}. This upper bound is to be put in contrast with the known fact that, for certain explicit systems of linear equations over the two-element field, such refutations require linear degree and exponential size if they are restricted to so-called static semi-algebraic proofs, and even tree-like semi-algebraic and sums-of-squares proofs. Our upper bound is a more or less direct translation of an argument due to Grigoriev, Hirsch and Pasechnik (Moscow Mathematical Journal, 2002) who did it for a family of linear systems of interest in propositional proof complexity. We point out that their method is more general and can be thought of as simulating Gaussian elimination. 1 Semi-algebraic proofs The proof system we consider is inspired by the Sherali-Adams and Lovász-Schrijver liftand-project methods for combinatorial optimization [8, 4], seen as proof systems for deriving polynomial inequalities (see also [6, 3, 5]). In addition to the axioms xi ≥ 0 1− xi ≥ 0 x 2 i − xi ≥ 0 xi − x 2 i ≥ 0 for formal variables x1, . . . , xn, it has the following inference rules: P (x) ≥ 0 Q(x) ≥ 0 a · P (x) + b ·Q(x) ≥ 0 P (x) ≥ 0 P (x) · xi ≥ 0 P (x) ≥ 0 P (x) · (1− xi) ≥ 0 where P (x) and Q(x) are polynomials with rational coefficients and variables within x = (x1, . . . , xn), and a and b are non-negative rational numbers. The first rule is called positive linear combination and the second and third rules are called multiplication or lifting rules. 1 It follows from [4] that if a system of linear inequalities over the reals in n variables does not have any solution in {0, 1}, then the trivial contradiction −1 ≥ 0 can be derived from the given inequalities, even if all polynomials are restricted to total degree two. In general, the length of such a proof could be exponential in a polynomial in n, but the shortest such proof is never worse than that. Here, by length we mean the number of derived inequalities. This and other complexity measures for proofs are defined next. The degree of a proof is the maximum of the total degrees of the polynomials that appear in it. The length of a proof is the number of inferences. The size of a proof is the sum of the sizes of the polynomials that appear in it, where the size of a polynomial is the sum of the degrees of its monomials. A proof is tree-like if every derived inequality is used at most once as the hypothesis of another rule, i.e. the shape of the proof is a tree, with the hypotheses and the axioms at the leaves and the conclusion at the root. A refutation is a proof of −1 ≥ 0. When we write an inequality P (x) ≥ Q(x) what we really mean is P (x)−Q(x) ≥ 0. Similarly, when we write an equation P (x) = Q(x) what we really mean is the set of the two inequalities P (x)−Q(x) ≥ 0 and Q(x)− P (x) ≥ 0. 2 Some facts about semi-algebraic proofs For every linear form L(x) = ∑n i=1 aixi with rational coefficients and every integer c, let Dc(L(x)) be the quadratic polynomial (L(x)− c) · (L(x) − c + 1). In words, the inequality Dc(L(x)) ≥ 0 states that L(x) does not fall in the open interval (c− 1, c). Such statements have short proofs of low degree: Lemma 1 (Grigoriev, Hirsch, and Pasechnik [3]). For every integer c and for every linear form L(x) = ∑n i=1 aixi with integer coefficients a1, . . . , an, the inequality Dc(L(x)) ≥ 0 has a tree-like proof of length polynomial in max{|ai| : i = 1, . . . , n} and n, and degree at most 3. The next lemma states that polynomial equalities can be freely substituted. A similar statement appears in [3][Lemma 5.2]; our statement is slightly stronger. Lemma 2. Let P (x), Q(x), and R(x, y) be polynomials with variables as indicated, and let d be the degree of y in R(x, y). The equation R(x, P (x)) = R(x, Q(x)) has a proof from P (x) = Q(x) of length bounded by a degree-d polynomial in the sizes of P (x), Q(x) and R(x, y), and degree at most linear in the degree of R(x, y) and d times the degrees of P (x) and Q(x). Proof. It suffices to prove the statement when R(x, y) is linear in y; the general statement in which y has degree d ≥ 1 in R(x, y) follows from iterating the lemma on the polynomial R(x, y1, . . . , yd) obtained fromR(x, y) by replacing each y s by ∏s i=1 yi. Write every monomial in R(x, y) in the form y ·M(x), where M(x) is a monomial without y. The equality P (x) · M(x) = Q(x) ·M(x) follows at once from P (x) = Q(x) by the multiplication rule. Adding up over all monomials of R(x, y) we get the result. To see the bound on the size note that, in case R(x, y) is linear in y, the size of R(x, P (x)) is bounded by the product of the sizes of R(x, y) and P (x), and similarly for R(x, Q(x)). Iterating d times to handle the general d ≥ 1 case we get the degree-d polynomial bound on the length of the proof. 2 3 Two-element field We identify the elements of the two-element field F2 with {0, 1}. Let x = (x1, . . . , xn) be formal variables ranging over F2 or Q, depending on the context. For every linear equation of the form ax = b, where a ∈ Fn2 and b ∈ F2, let S(a, b) be the system of linear inequalities	aixi;alexander schrijver;algebraic equation;coefficient;combinatorial optimization;degree (graph theory);degree of a polynomial;emoticon;formal language;gaussian elimination;iterated function;lambda lifting;linear algebra;linear equation;linear inequality;linear multistep method;linear system;lovász number;mathematical optimization;monomial;proof calculus;proof complexity;quadratic function;regular semi-algebraic system;semi-thue system;semiconductor industry;simulation;social inequality;system of linear equations;time complexity	Albert Atserias	2015	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	39.86015563180052	38.22626201941226	4671

This scheme, called IS1 coding, combines trellis coding with precoding (used to combat ISI). Like the recently introduced precoding scheme of Laroia, Tretter, and Farvardin (LTF), the IS1 coder makes it possible to achieve both shaping and coding gains over IS1 channels. By combining coding and precoding, however, the IS1 coder makes the “precoding loss” independent of the number of coset partitions used to generate the trellis code. At high rates (large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)), this makes it possible to approach the Shannon capacity of an IS1 channel. The V.34 (formerly V.fast) international modem standard for high-speed (up to 28.8 kb/s) communication over voice-band telephone lines uses the version of the IS1 coder described in Section IV of this paper.	catastrophic interference;channel capacity;convolutional code;data rate units;information sciences institute;interference (communication);large-signal model;list of itu-t v-series recommendations;modem;noise shaping;shannon capacity of a graph;signal-to-noise ratio;telephone line;trellis quantization	Rajiv Laroia	1996	IEEE Trans.

The approach has a deterministic runtime of O(1/ε2 log n. TMIS(nO(1/ε))), where TMIS(m) denotes the distributed time of computing a maximal independent set on a graph with m nodes. An immediate result of the presented approach is a local algorithm with expected O(log2 n) time complexity. If the given graph stems from a wireless ad-hoc network, characterized by the bounded growth property, we can further improve the algorithm by a preprocessing step that first locally constructs a colored clustering structure. This structure is then used in the matching algorithm to speed up the procedure significantly; we obtain a deterministic local algorithm that requires O(log n log* n) communication rounds. The main part of the algorithm works by repeatedly modifying and improving an existing matching in the network, and can thus be easily adapted to cope with changing and mobile topologies.	binary logarithm;cluster analysis;distributed algorithm;hoc (programming language);independent set (graph theory);local algorithm;matching (graph theory);maximal independent set;maximal set;maximum cut;message passing;michael luby;preprocessor;randomized algorithm;time complexity;whole earth 'lectronic link;wireless router	Tim Nieberg	2008		10.1145/1400863.1400880	combinatorics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;blossom algorithm	Theory	18.627509432604164	33.5306305079915	4680

Applications are mapped to MPSoC's by representing it in the form of a task graph. Task scheduling involves mapping task to processor cores so as to meet the deadline. For a given deadline, slack at each node is defined by the amount of time by which a task execution can be delayed without missing the deadline. With increase in the number of cores and high application parallelism, NoC is becoming a bottleneck due to the presence of large number of concurrent communications. Increasing network resources (links and routers) reduces the communication time but the area and power goes up. In this paper we present an application aware heuristic to synthesize a minimal network connecting a set of cores in an MPSoC in the presence of hard deadlines. Our approach is based on modeling communication between a pair of processors as tasks known as “Comtasks”. The network is generated by “scheduling” these comtasks onto a set of routers so as to obtain a network with minimum area which fills up the available slack. Moreover, we also identify the set of overlapping comtasks and generate a minimal network to allow the maximum set of overlapping comtasks to execute concurrently. We compared our approach with a greedy network generation heuristic and the results show 80% benefit in the router area.	bottleneck (software);central processing unit;greedy algorithm;heuristic;image scaling;mpsoc;multi-core processor;multiprocessing;network on a chip;parallel computing;router (computing);scheduling (computing);slack variable;system on a chip	Bharath Phanibhushana;Kunal P.

In this letter, the impact of position estimation errors of the receiver on the finite-SNR DMT of the MIMO system is investigated. Formulas of the biased Cramér-Rao bound and the mean-square error lower bound of the biased finite-SNR DMT are proposed when the DMT value is influenced by the position estimation error of the receiver induced by a biased position estimator. Furthermore, based on the developed formulas, the case of the DMT over the Rayleigh fading channel and the position estimation errors raised by a radar is analyzed.	digital monetary trust;mimo;mean squared error;multiplexing;radar;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio	Tsung-Wei Chiang;Ju-Hong Lee	2016	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2578926	telecommunications;computer science;control theory;signal-to-noise ratio;radar;multiplexing;statistics;mimo	Mobile	41.09321679882466	74.26645789348561	4686

To assist with this analysis, we present a framework for performing joint exploration of both the architectural and circuit design spaces. In our approach, we use statistical inference techniques to create a model of a large micro-architectural design space from a small number of simulation samples. We then characterize the design tradeoffs of each of the underlying circuits and integrate these with the higher level architectural models to define the joint circuit-architecture design space. We use posynomial forms for all our models, enabling the use of convex optimization tools to efficiently search the joint design space. As an example, we apply this methodology to explore the power-performance tradeoffs in a dual-issue superscalar out-of-order processor, showing how the framework can be used to determine the optimal set of design parameters for energy efficiency. Compared to current architectural tools that use fixed circuit costs, joint optimization can reduce energy by up to 30% by considering circuit tradeoff characteristics.	circuit design;convex optimization;design space exploration;digital electronics;mathematical optimization;microarchitecture;posynomial;simulation;superscalar processor	Omid Azizi;Aqeel Mahesri;John P.

Voronoi diagrams has received a lot of attention in the literature. While the Delaunay triangulation is an important basic tool in geometric optimization algorithms, it is nontrivial to achieve a numerically stable computer implementation. In this technical note we assume that all generating points are grid points of a regularM byM lattice in the plane. Depending onM we derive the necessary word length a binary computer must have for integer representation in order to obtain exact Delaunay triangulations.

A possible connection has been highlighted by the results (based on experimental evidence and nonrigorous arguments from statistical mechanics) of Monasson et al. [1, 2]. Studying a version of random satisfiability that “interpolates” between 2-SAT and 3-SAT, they concluded that the order of the phase transition, combinatorially expressed by continuity of an order parameter called the backbone, might have algorithmic implications for the complexity of the important class of Davis-Putnam-Longman-Loveland (DPLL) algorithms [3]. A discontinuous or first-order transition was symptomatic of exponential complexity, whereas a continuous or second-order transition correlated with polynomial complexity. It is well understood by now that this connection is limited. For instance, k-XOR-SAT is a problem believed, based on arguments from statistical mechanics [4], to have a first-order phase transition. But it is easily solved by a polynomial algorithm, Gaussian elimination. One way to clarify the connection between phase transitions and computational complexity is to formalize the underlying intuition in a purely combinatorial way, devoid of any physics considerations. Firstorder phase transitions amount to a discontinuity in the (normalized) size of the backbone. For random k-SAT [5], and more specifically for the optimization problem MAX-k-SAT, the backbone has a combinatorial interpretation: it is the the set of literals that are “frozen” (assume the same value) in all optimal assignments. Intuitively, a large backbone size has implications for the complexity of finding such assignments: all literals in the backbone require well-defined values in order to satisfy the formula, but an algorithm assigning variables in an iterative fashion has very few ways to know what the “right” values to assign are. In the case in a first-order phase transition, the backbone of formulas just above the transition contains with high probability a fraction of the literals that is bounded away from zero. DPLL algorithms would then misassign a variable having Ω(n) height in the tree representing the behavior of the algorithm, forcing it to backtrack on the given variable. Assuming the algorithm cannot significantly “reduce” the size of the explored portion of this tree, a first-order phase transition would then w.h.p imply a 2 lower bound for the running time of DPLL on random instances located slightly above the transition. There exists, however, a significant flaw in the heuristic argument above: the backbone is defined with respect to optimal solutions, and would seem to imply that it is difficult to find solutions to, e.g., MAXK-SAT using algorithms that assign variables iteratively. But why should the continuity/discontinuity of the backbone be the relevant predictor for the complexity of the (often easier) decision problem, which is what DPLL algorithms try to solve anyway?	2-satisfiability;analysis of algorithms;backtracking;boolean satisfiability problem;computational complexity theory;constraint satisfaction;dpll algorithm;davis–putnam algorithm;decision problem;exclusive or;first-order predicate;first-order reduction;flaw hypothesis methodology;gaussian elimination;heuristic;internet backbone;interpolation;iterative method;kerrison predictor;mathematical optimization;max;optimization problem;polynomial;reflections of signals on conducting lines;scott continuity;time complexity;with high probability	Stefan Boettcher;Gabriel Istrate;Allon G.

96a6b7886c97ef97a5e5b9520ec047a07efa7c56	eave: error-aware video encoding supporting extended energy/qos trade-offs for mobile embedded systems	energy qos trade offs;distributed embedded systems;energy consumption;error resilience;error aware video encoding	Energy/QoS provisioning is challenging for video applications over lossy wireless network with power-constrained mobile handheld devices. In this work, we exploit the inherent error tolerance of video data to generate a range of acceptable operating points by controlling the amount of errors in the system. In particular, we propose an error-aware video encoding technique, EAVE, that intentionally injects errors while ensuring acceptable QoS. The expanded trade-off space generated by EAVE allows system designers to comparatively evaluate different operating points with varying QoS and energy consumption by aggressively exploiting error-resilience attributes, and could potentially result in significant energy savings. The novelty of our approach resides in active exploitation of errors to vary the operating conditions for further optimization of system parameters. Moreover, we present the adaptivity of our approach by incorporating the feedback from the decoding side to achieve the QoS requirement under the dynamic network status. Our experiments show that EAVE can reduce the energy consumption for an encoding device by up to 37% for a video conferencing application over a wireless network without quality degradation, compared to a standard video encoding technique over test video streams. Further, our experimental results demonstrate that EAVE can expand the design space by 14 times with respect to energy consumption and by 13 times with respect to video quality (compared to a traditional approach without active error exploitation) on average, over test video streams.	data compression;elegant degradation;embedded system;error-tolerant design;experiment;lossy compression;mathematical optimization;mobile device;provisioning;quality of service;streaming media	Kyoungwoo Lee;Nikil D.

Layered space-time coding with decision-feedback detection is a promising technique for future wireless communications. In this paper, we investigate power allocation at the transmitter to improve the performance of the decision-feedback detection. The proposed power allocation method may only depend on or is even independent of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the MIMO systems. When the SNR at the transmitter is not available, the power of each data stream is allocated according to the required bit-error-rate (BER) of the system. Computer simulation shows that the proposed method can improve the performance of a 2-input and 2-output system by 4 dB at 1% BER and that of a 4-input and 4-output system by 3.5 dB.	bit error rate;computer simulation;experiment;feedback;mimo;mobile phone;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter;x.690	Geoffrey Ye Li;Anthony C.

In most embedded systems, information processing is invisible to the user. The main reason for buying such a system is not information processing, but the system’s overall functionality. Embedded systems must also be efficient in terms of weight, cost, size, and energy consumption. Moreover, they must be dependable and in many cases must meet real-time constraints. The market for embedded systems will grow significantly over the next years. For example, Kontron, one of the leading vendors of embedded computers, expects 40% annual growth over the next four years in the voice-traffic network-equipment market (http://www.icsadvent.com/applications/ap_convergence.cfm).	computer;dependability;embedded system;information processing;real-time clock	Peter Marwedel	2002	IEEE Design & Test of Computers	10.1109/MDT.2002.1018128	process design;embedded system;job shop scheduling;embedded operating system;application software;parallel computing;real-time computing;embedded software;computer science;software design;operating system;software engineering;system testing	Embedded	8.849637336315949	55.42659397155947	4727

To enhance network performance in a urban environment a controller to auto-tune parameters has been proposed. An urban mobility model has also been defined in order to test the proposed method under realistic conditions. This model allows to investigate some performance features, wich are not visible with a simple mobility model. In this paper, we propose to use a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) for the optimization of handover parameters for adaptive load balancing. Results show that under an agglomeration of vehicles in a main road of the scenario, the proposed method achieves an improvement in the global Call Blocking Ratio (CBR).	admissible heuristic;auto-tune;case-based reasoning;compaq lte;fuzzy logic;load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;network performance;self-tuning;unified extensible firmware interface	Jaime Rodríguez Membrive;Isabel de la Bandera;Pablo Muñoz Luengo;Raquel Barco	2011	2011 IEEE 73rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2011.5956149	real-time computing;simulation;resource allocation;computer science;engineering;load balancing;computational model;fuzzy control system;computer network	Robotics	24.469185714748374	91.99725156751879	4728

In contrast with most unidirectional MFSA, a metasurface as a superstrate is employed to reduce the back-lobe radiation and enhance the gain without a metal reflector. The metasurface exhibits the near-zero permeability (0&#60; μ &#60;1) and negative reflection phase. Design considerations for the proposed structure are given, and the design is validated by measurements. The measured radiation patterns show that the proposed structure can offer a high radiation efficiency, a good front to back radiation ratio, and a high co-cross polarization ratio. Due to the negative reflection phase of metasurface, the overall thickness of the proposed antenna is only 9.9 mm, which corresponds to λ0/12 at center frequency of 2.45 GHz.	acoustic lobing;bandwidth (signal processing);fr-4;microstrip;polarization (waves);printed circuit board;printing;radiation pattern;thickness (graph theory)	Sarawuth Chaimool;Chawalit Rakluea;Prayoot Akkaraekthalin	2011	2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)	10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146078	electronic engineering;microstrip antenna;telecommunications;antenna measurement;directional antenna;patch antenna;antenna;radiation pattern;optics;slot antenna	Arch	66.27912933827281	57.81226716637552	4732

With the rising impact of process variations on block characteristics such as width, length and aspect ratio, a traditional deterministic floorplanner is unable to take block variations into account and a variability-aware floorplanner is needed. In this paper, we use an affine arithmetic (AA) model to develop a fast and optimized variability-aware floorplanner. The AA model enables a fast and accurate estimation of the variable range of floorplan metrics such as area and wirelength in the presence of variations of each block dimension. Compared with the Monte Carlo simulation results, the average errors of mean and range values computed by the proposed method are −0.78% & −12.96% respectively for area, −2.43% & −13.23% respectively for wirelength and up to 1000X speed up by testing on five MCNC benchmarks. Our solution to this problem is also interesting to related problems such as warehouse floorplanning.	affine arithmetic;floorplan (microelectronics);image scaling;monte carlo method;simulation;spatial variability	Wenjuan Zhang;Shefali Srivastava;Yajun Ha	2010	2010 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/APCCAS.2010.5775008	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method	EDA	22.779073850931653	57.86160126083768	4746

A wireless link is generally characterized by high transmission errors, random interference and a varying latency. The erratic packet losses usually lead to a curbing of the flow of segments on the TCP connection and thus limit TCP's performance. This paper examines the impact of the lossy nature of IEEE 802.11 wireless networks on the TCP performance and proposes a scheme to improve the performance of TCP over wireless links. A negative acknowledgment scheme, selective negative acknowledgment (SNACK), is applied on TCP over wireless networks and a series of ns-2 simulations are performed to compare its performance against that of other TCP schemes. The simulation results confirm that SNACK and its proposed enhancement SNACK-S, which incorporates a bandwidth estimation model at the sender, outperform conventional TCP implementations in 802.11 wireless networks.	acknowledgment index;bandwidth management;end-to-end principle;interference (communication);lossy compression;network packet;router (computing);simulation	Rung-Shiang Cheng;Hui-Tang Lin	2007	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2007.6182851	tcp westwood;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;radio link protocol;tcp delayed acknowledgment;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;telecommunications;computer science;bic tcp;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;transport layer;computer network	Mobile	0.08760194602300012	101.94866214153936	4758

The algorithms are derived in the Bird-Meertens calculus for program transformations. This calculus provides a concise functional notation for algorithms, and a few powerful theorems for proving equalities of functions. The theory for the derivation of on-line algorithms is illustrated with the derivation of an algorithm for finding palindromes. An on-line linear-time random access machine (RAM) algorithm for finding the longest palindromic substring in a string is derived. For the purpose of finding the longest palindromic substring, all maximal palindromic substrings are computed. The list of maximal palindromes obtained in the computation of the longest palindrome can be used for other purposes such as finding the largest palindromic rectangle in a matrix and finding the shortest partition of a string into palindromes.	computation;largest empty rectangle;longest palindromic substring;maximal set;online algorithm;online and offline;program transformation;random access;random-access machine;random-access memory;time complexity	Johan Jeuring	1994	Algorithmica	10.1007/BF01182773	time complexity;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;data type;computer science;mathematics;geometry;programming language;algorithm	Theory	13.280510709387421	27.006885653241397	4761

First, the well-known Alamouti scheme is extended to NT = 2m transmit antennas achieving high transmit diversity. Many receiver details are worked out for four and eight transmit antennas. Further, solutions for arbitrary, even numbers (NT = 2k) of transmit antennas are presented achieving decoding advantages due to orthogonalization properties while preserving high diversity. In a final step, such extended Alamouti and BLAST schemes are combined, offering a continuous trade-off between quality of service (QoS) and data rate. Due to the simplicity of the coding schemes, they are very well suited to operate under UMTS with only very moderate modifications in the existing standard. The number of supported antennas at transmitter alone is a sufficient knowledge to select the most appropriate scheme. While the proposed schemes are motivated by utilization in UMTS, they are not restricted to this standard.	blast;data rate units;mimo;quality of service;transmitter;whole earth 'lectronic link	Christoph F.

We present results of Soft Error Rate (SER) analysis of an embedded processor. Our SER analysis platform accurately models all generation, propagation and masking effects starting from a technology response model derived using TCAD simulations at the device level all the way to application masking. The platform employs a combination of empirical models at the device level, analytical error propagation at logic level and fault emulation at the architecture/application level to provide the detailed contribution of each component (flip-flops, combinational gates, and SRAMs) to the overall SER. At each stage in the modeling hierarchy, an appropriate level of abstraction is used to propagate the effect of errors to the next higher level. Unlike previous studies which are based on very simple test chips, analyzing the entire processor gives more insight into the contributions of different components to the overall SER. The results of this analysis can assist circuit designers to adopt effective hardening techniques to reduce the overall SER while meeting required power and performance constraints.	clock rate;clock signal;combinational logic;electronic component;embedded system;emulator;flops;flip-flop (electronics);logic level;propagation of uncertainty;simulation;single event upset;soft error;software propagation;static random-access memory;traffic collision avoidance system	Mojtaba Ebrahimi;Adrian Evans;Mehdi Baradaran Tahoori;Razi Seyyedi;Enrico Costenaro;Dan Alexandrescu	2014	2014 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)		nanoelectronics;embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;engineering;electrical engineering;operating system	EDA	21.808788870308362	56.62627800362376	4772

However, these two criteria can potentially be in conflict in a generic-topology multihop wireless network where a single logical channel is shared among multiple contending flows and spatial reuse of the channel bandwidth is possible. In this paper, we propose a new model for packet scheduling that addresses this conflict. The main results of this paper are the following: (a) a two-tier service model that provides a minimum “fair” allocation of the channel bandwidth for each packet flow and additionally maximizes spatial reuse of bandwidth, (b) an ideal centralized packet scheduling algorithm that realizes the above service model, and (c) a practical distributed backoff-based channel contention mechanism that approximates the ideal service within the framework of the CSMA/CA protocol.	algorithm;backoff;centralized computing;emoticon;multitier architecture;network packet;provable prime;scheduling (computing);simulation;traffic flow (computer networking)	Haiyun Luo;Songwu Lu;Vaduvur Bharghavan	2000		10.1145/345910.345923	fair-share scheduling;web application;real-time computing;packet analyzer;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;evaluation;service-oriented modeling;fair queuing;distributed computing;interactivity;round-robin scheduling;proportionally fair;computer network	Mobile	0.9358919125565526	95.09665871912277	4776

The availability of each node is modeled by an independent, {0, 1}-valued continuous time Markov chain. Sensor locations form a nonhomogeneous spatial Poisson process. The sensing areas of the sensors are circles of i.i.d. radii. We first describe the induced nonstationary Markov-Boolean model and obtain k-coverage of the target at an arbitrary time instant. We then obtain k-coverage statistics for the time interval [0, T]: A pointwise stationary approximation that yields a limit theorem is also discussed.

The main emphasis is on the optimisation of a new design of a perfect reconstruction QMF bank using infinite impulse response (IIR) filters based on transformation of variables technique. The genetic algorithm (GA) optimisation is used for the initial design of the QMF bank and for the IIR filters using finite word length coefficients. The optimised results are then applied to a real time digital signal processing kit. Finally, some test results for data compression achievable using different values of encoded bits are included.	coefficient;data compression;digital signal processing;filter bank;genetic algorithm;infinite impulse response;mathematical optimization;quadrature mirror filter;real-time transcription;reconstruction filter;software release life cycle	Gurvinder S.

In this paper, we introduce a simulation-based architecture dedicated to performance assessment that has been initially designed for pure production control schemes and finally extended to planning algorithms. After the description of the framework and its implementation, the performance of two mid-term planning approaches is assessed with the help of the proposed architecture. The planning performance is evaluated by means of a stability measure in a rolling horizon environment.

This shows that these algorithms are fundamentally more complex to analyze than backtracking and forward checking.

In this paper, the fundamental features of the in-car UWB channel in terms of large-scale and small-scale parameters are investigated. These values are based on measurement data collected with a vector network analyzer (VNA) in the frequency band of 3-8 GHz. With the aid of the measurements, simple preliminary empirical models have been derived describing both, path loss as well as small-scale features of the channel. The results are shown for LOS and NLOS situations as well as for an empty car and a car occupied with persons.	bit error rate;frequency band;multipath propagation;packet analyzer;ray tracing (graphics);simulation;ultra-wideband	Moritz Schack;Jaouhar Jemai;Radoslaw Piesiewicz;Robert Geise;Ingo Schmidt;Thomas Kürner	2008	VTC Spring 2008 - IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2008.107	electronic engineering;network analyzer;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;path loss;ultra-wideband;empirical modelling;computer-aided manufacturing;data collection	Vision	25.53532995835179	80.1162505700478	4792

ef0fbc439b6d3e59fc21f13bee835241f56bd03e	onboard beam generation for multibeam satellite systems		This paper aims at designing an onboard beam generation process for a hybrid onboard on-ground multibeam satellite architecture. The proposed method offers a good tradeoff between total throughput and feeder link bandwidth requirements compared with pure on-ground systems. Full frequency reuse among beams is considered, and the beamforming at the satellite is designed for supporting interference mitigation techniques. In addition, in order to reduce the payload cost and complexity, this onboard beamforming is assumed to be constant and the same for forward and return link transmissions so that the same array-fed reflector can be used for forward and return links, leading to a substantial reduction of the payload mass. To meet all these requirements, a novel robust minimum mean square error optimization is conceived. The benefits of the considered scheme are evaluated with respect to the current approaches both analytically and numerically. Indeed, we show that with the DVB-RCS and DVB-S2 standards, our proposal allows increasing the total throughput within a range between 6% and 15% with respect to other onboard processing techniques in the return and forward link, respectively.	beamforming;dvb-s2;digital video broadcasting;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;mean squared error;numerical analysis;on-board data handling;requirement;return channel;telecommunications link;throughput	Vahid Joroughi;Miguel &#x00C1;ngel V&#x00E1;zquez;Ana I.

Architectural Vulnerability Factor (AVF) modeling is often used to capture the probability that a radiation-induced fault in a hardware structure will manifest as an error at the program output. AVF estimation requires detailed microarchitectural simulations which are time-consuming and typically present aggregate metrics. Moreover, it requires a large number of simulations to derive insight into the impact of microarchitectural events on AVF. In this work we present a first-order mechanistic analytical model for computing AVF by estimating the occupancy of correct-path state in important microarchitecture structures through inexpensive profiling. We show that the model estimates the AVF for the reorder buffer, issue queue, load and store queue, and functional units in a 4-wide issue machine with a mean absolute error of less than 0.07. The model is constructed from the first principles of out-of-order processor execution in order to provide novel insight into the interaction of the workload with the microarchitecture to determine AVF. We demonstrate that the model can be used to perform design space explorations to understand trade-offs between soft error rate and performance, to study the impact of scaling of microarchitectural structures on AVF and performance, and to characterize workloads for AVF.	aggregate data;aggregate function;approximation error;first-order predicate;image scaling;microarchitecture;microprocessor;re-order buffer;register renaming;simulation;soft error	Arun Asokan Nair;Stijn Eyerman;Lieven Eeckhout;Lizy Kurian John	2012	2012 39th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)		computer simulation;design;computer architecture;supercomputer;parallel computing;real-time computing;soft error;prediction;first principle;microarchitecture;computer science;operating system;diameter;mathematical model;steady state;mean absolute error;integrated circuit design	Arch	-2.7056189746680794	56.12225380475018	4812

Our lemma corresponds to the nonsystematic encoding of affine variety codes, and can be stated by giving a canonical linear map as the composition of an extension through linear feedback shift registers from a Gröbner basis and a generalized inverse discrete Fourier transform. We clarify that our lemma yields the error-value estimation in the fast erasure-and-error decoding of a class of dual affine variety codes. Moreover, we show that systematic encoding corresponds to a special case of erasure-only decoding. The lemma enables us to reduce the computational complexity of error-evaluation from O(n3) using Gaussian elimination to O(qn2) with some mild conditions on n and q, where n is the code length and q is the finite-field size.	coding theory;computational complexity theory;discrete fourier transform;erasure code;folded reed–solomon code;gaussian elimination;gröbner basis;linear algebra;linear-feedback shift register	Hajime Matsui	2014	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2014.2311042	block code;reed–muller code;list decoding;concatenated error correction code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;fountain code;sequential decoding;serial concatenated convolutional codes;bcjr algorithm;linear code;gaussian process;feedback;luby transform code;mathematics;shift register;computational complexity theory;berlekamp–welch algorithm;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;statistics;algebra	Theory	41.434228031082014	56.02715388132768	4817

We consider mixed traffic with voice over IP (VOIP) and best effort (BE) services. In order to improve cell-edge performance and guarantee diverse quality of service (QoS), a utility-based joint scheduling algorithm is proposed, which consists of two steps: ant colony optimization (ACO) based joint user selection and greedy subchannel assignment. We compare the proposed algorithm with the optimal algorithm and the greedy user selection (GUS) based scheme. Via simulation results, we show that the performance of our proposed algorithm well approaches to that of the optimal solution. It is also observed that 95% of BE users are satisfied with average cell-edge data rate greater than 200kbps by using either of the two algorithms. Whereas, our proposed algorithm ensures that more than 95% of VoIP users are satisfied with packet drop ratio less than 2%, compared to 78% by the GUS based algorithm.	ant colony optimization algorithms;best-effort delivery;combinatorial optimization;data rate units;digital subchannel;greedy algorithm;mathematical optimization;network packet;optimization problem;performance;provisioning;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Binru Huang;Tommy Svensson	2012	2012 IEEE 75th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240135	greedy algorithm;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;telecommunications service;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	27.95196741821535	93.39811981220969	4819

3363147bd13d7aa35169c62dfe818148c59d3967	the load-distance balancing problem	approximation algorithms;facility assignment	Problems dealing with assignment of clients to servers have been widely studied. However, they usually do not model the fact that the delay incurred by a client is a function of both the distance to the assigned server and the load on this server, under a given assignment. We study a problem referred to as the load-distance balancing (LDB) problem, where the objective is assigning a set of clients to a set of given servers. Each client suffers a delay, that is, the sum of the network delay (which is proportional to the distance to its server) and the congestion delay at this server, a nondecreasing function of the number of clients assigned to the server. We address two flavors of LDB—the first one seeking to minimize the maximum incurred delay, and the second one targeted for minimizing the average delay. For the first variation, we present hardness results, a best possible approximation algorithm, and an optimal algorithm for a special case of linear placement of clients and servers. For the second one, we show the problem is NP-hard in general, and present a 2-approximation for concave delay functions and an exact algorithm, if the delay function is convex. We also consider the game theoretic version of the second problem and show the price of stability of the game is at most 2 and at least 4/3. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We consider the decode-and-forward protocol which is divided into two phases: Multiple Access phase and Broadcast phase. The main focus of this work is on the broadcast phase during which two data blocks received by the RS have to be sent to the BS and MS using the same channel resources. It may be achieved by incorporating network coding, where the binary sum of two data blocks is broadcast to both end nodes. In this paper, we demonstrate that when multiple antennas are available at the transmitter and receiver, applying network coding is not the optimal solution. We present a novel approach that exploits the MU-MIMO scheme and together with the proposed SVD precoding algorithm and interference cancellation receiver, provides a significant performance improvement. In the proposed scheme, we assume full channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), which in a time division duplex (TDD) system may be obtained by exploiting the reciprocity of the wireless channel. The performance of the considered scenario is analyzed and verified through multi-link level simulations.	algorithm;broadcast relay station;channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);linear network coding;mimo;modulation;multi-user mimo;propagation constant;simulation;singular value decomposition;software propagation;test-driven development;transmitter	Karolina Ratajczak;Krzysztof Bakowski;Krzysztof Wesolowski	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952037	3g mimo;linear network coding;telecommunications;sine;computer network	Mobile	38.30652924884137	83.23707584334029	4846

The pre-allocated backup bandwidth cannot provide 100% protection guarantee when multiple failures occur in a network. In this article, we focus on how to recover the protecting capabilities of FIPP (Failure-independent path-protecting) p-cycles against the subsequent links failure on WDM networks, after recovering the working paths affected by the failure of link. Two recovering policies are designed to recover the protecting capabilities of the FIPP p-cycles if possible, unless there is no sufficient network resource. They are Cycle Recovery Policy and Path Recovery Policy. In addition, a Cycle Adjust algorithm is proposed and used to recover the affected cycles. The simulation results of the proposed methods are also given.	algorithm;backup;chi;computation;din connector;disaster recovery plan;information and computer science;information engineering;information science;java community process;parallel redundancy protocol;routing;senao networks;simulation;software engineer;wavelength-division multiplexing;word error rate	Der-Rong Din;Hsin-Chi Lai	2011	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-011-0307-1	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer security;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network	HPC	-1.0314828993845684	83.14244186434664	4862

The estimator utilizes the approximate orthogonality of the array response vectors of large arrays to obtain a vector which is the superposition of the probability distributions of the direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) of the sources. Then, the angular parameters can be estimated by fitting distribution functions to this vector successively. Hence, the complexity of the proposed approach is much lower than that of other well-known estimators which require the fitting of a matrix. Analysis and numerical results show that the proposed estimator can achieve better performance than other estimators.	angularjs;approximation algorithm;curve fitting;numerical analysis	Anzhong Hu;Tiejun Lv	2013	MILCOM 2013 - 2013 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2013.84	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;smart antenna;mathematics;statistics	Vision	52.66481741280494	7.504328988248097	4865

The wireless channel in such systems is shared by vehicles within the transmission range of each other. Due to the near-linear spatial distribution of vehicles in a highway scenario, the vehicular broadcast network is heavily affected by the hidden node interference phenomenon, which considerably limits its capacity. The performance of vehicle tracking application that is the basis for CVSS is therefore significantly affected by the performance of the underlying network. The two main parameters that affect the network condition and performance are the range and rate (frequency) of transmission of safety and tracking messages. In this paper, we analyze the effect of different choices of rate and range and present models that quantify network performance in terms of its ability to disseminate tracking information. Following a thorough analysis of the hidden node affected VANET, we show that channel occupancy or busy ratio can be used as a feedback measure that quantifies the success of information dissemination and, consequently, the CVSS, under different network conditions. These findings are used to design feedback control schemes for transmission range adaptation, which are robust to variations of road and network traffic.	feedback;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);network performance;network traffic control;vehicle tracking system	Yaser P.

Error detection and correction techniques are therefore required. Orthogonal Code is one of the codes that can detect errors and correct corrupted data. An n-bit orthogonal code has n/2 is and n/2 0s. In a previous work these properties have been exploited to detect and correct errors. In this paper we present a new methodology to enhance error detection capabilities of the orthogonal code. The technique was implemented experimentally using field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). The results show that the proposed technique improves the detection capabilities of the orthogonal code by approximately 50%, resulting in 99.9% error detection, and corrects as predicted up to (n/4-1) bits of error in the received impaired code with bandwidth efficiency.	code;convolution;crosstalk;emi;error detection and correction;experiment;field-programmable gate array;spectral efficiency	Naima Kaabouch;Aparna Dhirde;Saleh Faruque	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology	10.1109/EIT.2007.4374465	systematic code;parallel computing;constant-weight code;error detection and correction;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;cyclic code;code rate;mathematics;field-programmable gate array;statistics	EDA	44.990504945538845	67.02796654688832	4878

This paper derives the exact and approximate cumulative density function and probability density function (PDF) for the dual selection with MRC over nonidentical imperfect channel estimation. Using the distribution, the exact and approximate closed-form expressions of the outage probability are derived with quantification of diversity order. Further, this paper derived the exact ergodic capacity and approximate outage capacity of the the dual selection via Gaussian and Gamma approximations. The numerical results show that the capacity of the dual selection with MRC is enhanced by the number of receive antennas as well as the number of user terminals and sum of channel correlation coefficients, while the order of the receive spatial diversity for outage probability is eliminated by the nonidentical channel estimation error.	approximation algorithm;channel state information;coefficient;downtime;ergodicity;gamma correction;mimo;maximal set;numerical analysis;portable document format;profiling (computer programming);sun outage	Donghun Lee	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2774365	electronic engineering;probability density function;cumulative distribution function;algorithm;capacity planning;antenna diversity;computer science;gaussian;maximal-ratio combining;communication channel;signal-to-noise ratio	Metrics	38.619656271010406	77.50792274052513	4894

The sensor is allowed to take one observation at a time. It has been shown in a recent work that if each observation comes from one sequence, Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) test is optimal. In this paper, we propose a new approach in which each observation can be a linear combination of samples from multiple sequences. The test has two stages. In the first stage, namely scanning stage, one takes a linear combination of a pair of sequences with the hope of scanning through sequences that are unlikely to be generated from F1 and quickly identifying a pair of sequences such that at least one of them is highly likely to be generated by F1. In the second stage, namely refinement stage, one examines the pair identified from the first stage more closely and picks one sequence to be the final sequence. The problem under this setup belongs to a class of multiple stopping time problems. In particular, it is an ordered two concatenated Markov stopping time problem. We obtain the optimal solution using the tools from the multiple stopping time theory. Numerical simulation results show that this search strategy can significantly reduce the searching time, especially when F1 is rare.	concatenation;markov chain;refinement (computing);simulation	Jun Geng;Weiyu Xu;Lifeng Lai	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620693	probability distribution;mathematical optimization;statistical hypothesis testing;combinatorics;sequence;mathematics;markov process;statistics	Theory	45.76435096613631	7.928328759730987	4910

The target environment is partitioned into grids and the sensors within each grid elect one representative to carry out the sense task in turn, with low communication overhead, balanced energy consumption and good scalability. It is demonstrated by analysis and simulation that the grid-based sense schedule can achieve energy saving proportional to the node density and guaranty better detection quality than random schedule.

Broline, Crowe and Isaacs have assigned a symmetric matrix to each polygon triangulation and computed the determinant. In this paper we consider d-angulations of polygons and generalize the combinatorial algorithm for computing the entries in the associated symmetric matrices; we compute their determinants and the Smith normal forms. It turns out that both are independent of the particular d-angulation, the determinant is a power of d − 1, and the elementary divisors only take values d − 1 and 1. We also show that in the generalized frieze patterns obtained in our setting every adjacent 2× 2determinant is 0 or 1, and we give a combinatorial criterion for when they are 1, which in the case d = 3 gives back the Conway-Coxeter condition on frieze patterns.	algorithm;combinatorial optimization;conway's game of life;database normalization;eisenstein's criterion;polygon (computer graphics);polygon triangulation	Christine Bessenrodt;Thorsten Holm;Peter Jørgensen	2014	J.

bf653ac8bfddd48181904b638602bde82c746be7	joint radar-communications design based on time modulated array		Abstract The demand for coexistence of radar and communication systems is increasing rapidly in recent years. In this paper, we propose a joint radar-communications design based on time modulated array (TMA) to satisfy the need of electronic system integration in civil and military, and mitigate the tension of spectrum resource. First, we investigate the basic characteristics of the TMA. Then, we present a TMA-based waveform design algorithm for joint radar-communications. By using the derived results, a dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) system is established, which can detect targets in a large scanning range and maintain the communication direction static simultaneously, while avoiding the mutual interference. Moreover, the communication direction can be adjusted easily as needed. The validity of the theoretical derivations is demonstrated via simulations.	modulation;radar	Chengzhao Shan;Yongkui Ma;Honglin Zhao;Xiaoping Liu	2018	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2018.07.013	system integration;mathematical optimization;communications system;mathematics;waveform;radar;electronic engineering;interference (wave propagation);communication design	EDA	45.76870511032546	84.9487629543848	4927

It is possible to monitor phenomena such as physical loads on joints or implants, vital signs, or osseointegration in vivo and in real time. Microelectromechanical (MEMS)-based generation techniques can allow for the autonomous operation of implantable biosensors by generating electrical power to replace or supplement existing battery-based power systems. By supplementing existing battery-based power systems for implantable biosensors, the operational lifetime of the sensor is increased. In addition, the potential for a greater amount of available power allows additional components to be added to the biosensing module, such as computational and wireless and components, improving functionality and performance of the biosensor. Photovoltaic, thermovoltaic, micro fuel cell, electrostatic, electromagnetic, and piezoelectric based generation schemes are evaluated in this paper for applicability for implantable biosensing. MEMS-based generation techniques that harvest ambient energy, such as vibration, are much better suited for implantable biosensing applications than fuel-based approaches, producing up to milliwatts of electrical power. High power density MEMS-based approaches, such as piezoelectric and electromagnetic schemes, allow for supplemental and replacement power schemes for biosensing applications to improve device capabilities and performance. In addition, this may allow for the biosensor to be further miniaturized, reducing the need for relatively large batteries with respect to device size. This would cause the implanted biosensor to be less invasive, increasing the quality of care received by the patient.	autonomous robot;biosensors;computation;electromagnetics;electrostatics;ibm power systems;implantable cardioverter-defibrillator;implantable defibrillator;implants;medication event monitoring system;microelectromechanical systems;osseointegration;patients;piezoelectricity;video-in video-out	Jonathan Lueke;Walied A.

Mobile Wireless Sensors Networks (MWSNs) is a subclass of WSNs in which some or all sensors are mobile. Although such mobility has benefits for extending network coverage, the existence of nodes mobility imposes challenges in the data delivery process as connectivity changes dynamically. This issue is exacerbated when nodes move in uncontrollable manner, e.g. mounted on helmets of factory workers or on vehicles. Existing WSNs routing protocols are mainly designed to support static or semi-dynamic scenarios. Due to the similarity between MWSNs and Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs), existing MANET routing protocols can be used for this purpose. In this paper, we use ns2 to evaluate the performance of two MANET routing protocols, GPSR and AOMDV, in the field of MWSNs with a location-based sensing application assuming the nodes move in an uncontrollable manner. We use metrics such as packet delivery ratio, routing overhead, hop count, and energy consumption to test protocols performance. We also use a utility function to estimate the performance of the application. We find that the geographic-based routing, GPSR, works better than AOMDV due to its lower routing protocol overhead.	greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;uncontrolled format string	Hosam Rowaihy;Ahmed BinSahaq	2016		10.1016/j.procs.2016.09.010	wireless routing protocol;routing;static routing;mobile ad hoc network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	HCI	6.255868258060703	80.00342761020845	4937

160cc5811d4f6d66dfc00a23149dde92d6de2ed1	construction of irregular qc-ldpc codes in near-earth communications		—High-speed, high-reliability requirements and strict power limitation of near-earth communications yield that the channel coding must have high coding gain and lower error floor. In this paper, an irregular quasi-cyclic low-density paritycheck (QC-LDPC) code for specific use in near-earth communications is proposed. In order to eliminate the impact of short-cycles and further improve the performance of codes, a base matrix with girth at least 8 is employed. Then dualdiagonal structure is adopted in parity check matrix to reduce encoding complexity. Besides, circulant permutation matrices and zero matrices with different sizes are used to fill the nonzero positions and zero positions of the base matrix so as to remove the complexity of the selection of cyclic shift coefficients. The adoption of circulant permutation matrices with different sizes ensures that the parity check matrix is full rank, which makes the code rate controllable. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the performance of the constructed codes by comparing with several existing codes.	channel capacity;circulant matrix;circular shift;code rate;coding gain;coefficient;communications satellite;error floor;forward error correction;girth (graph theory);low-density parity-check code;parity bit;parity-check matrix;requirement;simulation	Hui Zhao;Xiaoxiao Bao;Liang Qin;Ruyan Wang;Hong Zhang	2014	JCM	10.12720/jcm.9.7.541-547	turbo code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;generator matrix;hamming code;mathematics;algebra	Networks	42.157126187493446	58.73302282757555	4945

Three ways of using the evolution programs are investigated: sequential, all-parallel and one-parallel (with the same variable used in all programs or in only one, respectively); moreover, both deterministic and non-deterministic systems are considered. The Turing universality of some of the obtained classes of numerical P systems is proved (for polynomials with the smallest possible degree, one, also introducing a new proof technique in this area, namely starting the universality proof from the characterization of computable sets of numbers by means of register machines). The power of many other classes remains to be investigated.	autonomous robot;computable function;numerical analysis;p system;polynomial;register machine;robot control;universal turing machine;universality probability	Cristian Ioan Vasile;Ana Brândusa Pavel;Ioan Dumitrache;Gheorghe Paun	2012	Acta Informatica	10.1007/s00236-012-0166-y	discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	1.4619397887709873	24.122916532692166	4950

We minimize the costs of operating servers and serving appointments, subject to a joint chance constraint limiting the risk of server overtime. Using finite samples of the uncertainty, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program, and propose a two-stage programming framework where we keep cross-server decisions and constraints at the first stage, so that the remaining problem features a server-wise decomposable structure. The first-stage problem is a variant of the chance-constrained binary packing problem discussed in Song et al. (2014), in which appointments are packed to servers with a probabilistic overtime-free guarantee. The second-stage problem seeks feasible appointment schedules given appointment-to-server assignments. We solve the problems at both stages by methods of coefficient strengthening, bounding, and branch-and-cut with diverse forms of cutting planes. We also investigate variants that consider bounded appointment waiting time, expected overtime/waiting penalty, and use individual chance constraints to limit server overtime. We test instances with diverse problem and sample sizes to demonstrate the computational efficacy of different approaches.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;branch and cut;central processing unit;coefficient;computation;concave function;crew scheduling;cutting-plane method;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;operations research;parallel computing;scheduling (computing);server (computing);set packing	Yan Deng;Siqian Shen	2016	Math.

In this chapter, we investigate the challenges and opportunities in the design of scalable wireless systems to embrace such a “big data” era. We review state-of-the-art techniques in wireless big data processing and study the potential implementations of key technologies in the future wireless systems. We show that proper wireless system designs could harness, and in fact take advantages of the mobile big data traffic.	backhaul (telecommunications);big data;scalability;signal processing;spectral efficiency;systems design;telecommunications network	Suzhi Bi;Rui Zhang;Zhi Jun Ding;Shuguang Cui	2016		10.1017/CBO9781316162750.008	computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	22.349372203084624	86.09372282129044	4955

In this paper, we focus on solving the WSRMax optimization problem in a Home eNodeB (HeNB) wireless network for the multiple input single output (MISO) downlink transmission. Based on an ameliorated max-min multi-cell uplink-downlink throughput duality, we design a distributed algorithm which contains Loop1 and Loop2 associating with the max-min procedure, respectively. Especially, in Loop2 procedure, we propose a new distributed iteration scheme with the complete proof. During the implementation of the proposed algorithm, randomly deployed HeNBs only need to share information with their neighboring nodes. Simulation results show that the two processes can converge to a stable state, and the network capacity is dramatically improved with the coordination among HeNBs.	converge;distributed algorithm;expectation–maximization algorithm;iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;multistage interconnection networks;optimization problem;randomness;simulation;system analysis;telecommunications link;throughput;weight function	Zeming Hu;Yuanping Zhu;Jing Xu;Jiang Wang;Yang Yang	2015	EURASIP J.

We start by studying the recently proposed quadratic Lyapunov function based algorithms (QLA, also known as the MaxWeight algorithm). We show that for every stochastic problem, there is a corresponding deterministic problem, whose dual optimal solution “exponentially attracts” the network backlog process under QLA. In particular, the probability that the backlog vector under QLA deviates from the attractor is exponentially decreasing in their Euclidean distance. This is the first such result for the class of algorithms built upon quadratic Lyapunov functions. The result quantifies the “network gravity” role of Lagrange Multipliers in network scheduling. It not only helps to explain how QLA achieves the desired performance but also suggests that one can roughly “subtract out” a Lagrange multiplier from the system induced by QLA.	algorithm;euclidean distance;lagrange multiplier;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;network utility;queueing theory;scheduling (computing)	Longbo Huang;Michael J.

2a1eed3201e060f1b3565401d34bf08f4f621285	a slotted floor acquisition multiple access based mac protocol for underwater acoustic networks with rts competition	liang fang qian sen lin zhang mei qin liu a slotted floor acquisition multiple access based mac protocol for underwater acoustic networks with rts competition;underwater acoustic networks medium access control mac request to send rts competition throughput energy consumption	Long propagation delay, limited bandwidth, and high bit error rate pose great challenges in media access control (MAC) protocol design for underwater acoustic networks. A MAC protocol called slotted floor acquisition multiple access (slotted-FAMA) suitable for underwater acoustic networks is proposed and analyzed. This FAMA based protocol adds a time slot mechanism to avoid DATA packet collisions. However, slotted-FAMA is not suitable for dense networks since the multiple request-to-send (RTS) attempts problem in dense networks is serious and greatly limits the network throughput. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a slotted-FAMA based MAC protocol for underwater acoustic networks, called RC-SFAMA. RC-SFAMA introduces an RTS competition mechanism to keep the network from high frequency of backoff caused by the multiple RTS attempts problem. Via the RTS competition mechanism, useful data transmission can be completed successfully when the situation of multiple RTS attempts occurs. Simulation results show that RC-SFAMA increases the network throughput efficiency as compared with slotted-FAMA, and minimizes the energy consumption.	access control;acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;backoff;bit error rate;communications protocol;internet protocol suite;network packet;propagation delay;rc circuit;simulation;software propagation;throughput	Liang-fang Qian;Senlin Zhang;Meiqin Liu	2015	Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering	10.1631/FITEE.1400187	telecommunications;computer science;computer security;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless	Mobile	8.524697752839034	90.09723534880195	4978

488caed5bf975458e98f420e0e046e975e23f74d	towards optimal simulations of formulas by bounded-width programs	branching program	"""We show that, over an arbitrary ring, for any fixed e > 0, all balanced algebraic formulas of size s are computed by algebraic straight-line programs that employ a constant number of registers and have length O(sl+C). In particular, in the special case where the ring is GF(2) , we obtain a technique for simulating balanced Boolean formulas of size s by bounded-width branching programs of length O(sl+e), for any fixed c > 0. This is an asymptotic improvement in efficiency over previous simulations in both the Boolean and algebraic setting. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n The first investigation of the computational power of programs whose storage capacity is limited to a constant number of items was made by Borodin et al. (1983), and Chandra, et al. (1983). These authors considered the polynomial-length boundedwidth branching program as a model of computation for functions from {0, 1} ~ to {0, 1}. These programs are equivalent to polynomial-length straightline programs that employ a constant number of {0, 1}-valued read/wri te registers and have read-only access to their inputs. It had been conjectured that the polynomial-length bounded-width branching program was a weaker model of computation than the polynomial-size formula (and this conjecture was partially supported by the results of Borodin et al. (1983), Chandra et al. (1983), Yao (1983), Pfidlak (1984), and Ajtai et al. (1986)). Then Barrington (1986), using a beautiful construction, proved that in fact the two models of computation are equivalent.

To copy otherwise, or to republish, requires a fee and/or specific permission. (1988) extended Barrington's result to an algebraic setting by showing that, over an arbitrary ring, the functions computed by polynomial-size algebraic formulas are also computed by polynomial-length algebraic straight-line programs that use only a constant number of registers. This result generalizes Barrington's since, in the special case where the ring is GF(2) , it implies the former result. A feature of the constructions of Barrington (1986) as well as those of Ben-Or and Cleve (1988) is that, in general, they incur a polynomial increase in the total amount of work required to perform the computation: if the original formulas have size s and are balanced (i.e. have depth bounded by [logs]) then the resulting straight-line programs may have length up to f2(s2). (And when the formulas are not balanced, the resulting straight-line programs may have length even more than quadratic in s.) Cai and Lipton (1989) showed an alternative construction for the Boolean case that is subquadratic for balanced formulas. Their construction translates balanced Boolean formulas of size s into bounded-width branching programs of length 0(81""""811""""""""). We show that (in the algebraic as well as the Boolean setting) the exponent in the simulation can be made arbitrarily close to one. Tha t is, given any fixed e > 0, we show that all (algebraic or Boolean) balanced formulas of size s are computed by straightline programs that use a constant number of registers and have length O(sl+C). This affirms a conjecture of Cai and Lipton (1989), whose O(s l m l ' ) construction is the most efficient previously known one for tile Boolean case. In the algebraic case, the most efficient previously known construction is that of Ben-Or and Cleve (1988), which is O(s~). Also, for our O(s 1+~) construction, the formulas only need to be """"approximately balanced"""" in the sense that their depth is bounded by [(1 + ~)logs] for 'some ~ < e. In our constructions, the number of registers required to attain a particular bound on the exponent increases as the exponent approaches 1. More specifically, to achieve an exponent of 1 + e, the number of registers in our construction must be 4(~ +t) 1. For © 1990 ACM 089791-361-2/90/0005/0271 $1.50 271 this reason, it is impor tan t to regard the value of e as fixed. In practical terms, c cannot be made too small without a huge number of registers. It is of interest that the straight-line programs that arise in our constructions have a special form: they consist of s ta tements that apply (special) invertible linear operations to the registers. More precisely, if the number of registers is w, and one regards each possible configuration of values of the registers as a vector in 7""""¢ w then the effect of executing a s ta tement of these programs is equivalent to multiplying this vector by a w × w mat r ix with determinant 1 (and one entry of this mat r ix is an input or its negation, and the other entries are constants). Thus, the s ta tements that constitute these programs can be viewed as elements of SLw (7""""¢), the special linear group, consisting of w × w matrices with determinant 1. (In Barrington 's (1986), and Cai and Lipton 's (1989) constructions, the s ta tements of the programs can be viewed as elements of the group Ss, of permuta t ions on a five-element set. To further compare our results, we note that , when the ring is GF(2) , our programs are, in the language of Barrington, """"permutat ion branching programs of width 2 ~° 1"""" (where the """"states"""" are the nonzero elements of {0, 1}w).) The pr imary motivat ion for this research is complexity theoretic: to determine more precise relationships between two different characterizations of the complexity class NC 1. Also, there are a number of potential applications. Cai and Lipton (1989, p. 569) explain that computat ions expressed in terms of bounded-width branching programs, if they are efficient enough, are particularly well suited for hardware implementat ions by certain """"reconfigurable"""" VLSI chips. Also, Kilian (1988, pp. 23-26) has shown how to use permuta t ion branching programs to reduce the number of rounds of interaction required for certain cryptographic protocols. Roughly, by expressing formulas as bounded-width permuta t ion branching programs, Kilian shows how to construct protocols tha t perform """"oblivious function evaluations"""" of formulas in a constant number of rounds (whereas, previously proposed constructions require f~(s) rounds, for formulas of size s). A possible drawback of Kilian's construction is that , in exchange for the reduction in the number of rounds of interaction, the total number of bits that the parties need to communicate increases. This increase is due to the cost incurred by simulating formulas by bounded-width permuta t ion branching programs. Thus, more efficient simulations are of w lue here. 2 M o d e l s o f C o m p u t a t i o n Let (T¢, + , . , 0, 1) be an arbi trary ring. In this section, we define formulas and straight-line programs over """"/'¢. Our definition of a formula is very standard, and our definition of a """"linear bijection straight-line program"""" is compatible with the s tandard definition of a straight-line program (with additional restrictions). D e f i n i t i o n 1: A formula over (7~, + , . , 0, 1) of depth d is defined as follows. A depth 0 formula is either c, for some c E 7~ (a constant) or xu, for some u E {1,2, ...} (an input). For d > 0, a depth d formula is either ( f + g) or ( f g ) , where f and g are formulas of depth d / a n d d a (respectively) and d = max(d / , dg)+ 1. The size of a formula is defined as follows. A depth 0 formula has size 1, and if f and g have size s! and sg (respectively) then the sizes of ( f + g) and ( f . g) are both s! +_% + 1.

Brzozowski presented a selection of six open problems about regular languages and mentioned two other problems in the conclusion of his article. These problems have been the source of some of the greatest breakthroughs in automata theory over the past 35 years. This survey article summarizes the state of the art on these questions and the hopes for the next 35 years. Thirty-five years ago, at the IFIP Congress in 1980, Janusz A. Brzozowski [8] presented a selection of six open problems about regular languages and mentioned two other topics in the conclusion of his article. These six open problems were, in order, star height, restricted star height, group complexity, star removal, regularity of non-counting classes and optimality of prefix codes. The two other topics were the limitedness problem and the dot-depth hierarchy. These problems proved to be very influential in the development of automata theory and were the source of critical breakthroughs. The aim of this paper is to survey these results, to describe their impact on current research and to outline some hopes for the next thirty-five years. Due to the lack of space, the dot-depth hierarchy is treated in a separate article [61]. 1 Terminology, notation and background This goal of this section is to fix notation and terminology. We define in particular the notions of syntactic monoid, class of languages, variety, profinite word, profinite identity, semiring and weighted automaton. In the sequel, A denotes a finite alphabet and 1 denotes the empty word. A semigroup S divides a semigroup T if S is a quotient of a subsemigroup of T . ∗The author was funded from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 670624).	automata theory;automaton;context-free language;emoticon;empty string;finite-state transducer;graph coloring;international federation for information processing;prefix code;regular language;star height;syntactic monoid	Jean-Éric Pin	2017		10.1142/9789813148208_0007	programming language;regular language;mathematics	Theory	3.5754184514295666	21.40198975612398	4990

The BKK bound gives a much lower upper bound for the number of solutions, but unfortunately, constructing a start system based on this bound seems as hard as solving the original given polynomial system. This paper presents a way for computing an upper bound together with the construction of a start system. The first computation is performed symbolically. Due to this symbolic computation, the constructed start system can be solved numerically more efficiently. The paper generalizes current approaches for homotopy construction towards the BKK bound.	algorithm;bekenstein bound;numerical analysis;numerical continuation;preprocessor;symbolic computation;system of polynomial equations	Jan Verschelde;Ronald Cools	1993	Applicable Algebra in Engineering, Communication and Computing	10.1007/BF01202036	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;symbolic computation;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;algebra	Logic	48.74887380634133	36.986108512282506	4991

Solid-state memory— static RAM (SRAM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), and flash (initially EPROM)—is based on electron storage in transistors, while mechanical memory—tape and the hard disk drive (HDD)—relies on magnetic storage. These two storage media have had an amazingly long life, roughly doubling in density and halving in cost every two years according to Moore’s law. The scalability of these technologies explains why they have been a key enabler in the emergence of increasingly complex computing devices. Memory is a defining component in many of today’s portable devices that themselves are becoming indispensable to our lives. In a smartphone or tablet, memory is typically second, and often equal, to the display as the largest cost component of the system, well above the CPU. For high-end computing systems such as servers, memory defines system performance and power more than any other component. As the demand for large amounts of data instantly accessible to millions of users continues to increase, memory technology becomes both a solution and a bottleneck, spurring the industry to redefine how these systems use memory. One of the best examples of this is the emergence of solid-state drives (SSDs) across the range of computing devices. The rapid density growth and cost reduction of memory has been enabled by scaling the underlying technologies to ever-smaller feature sizes and thus smaller memory-bit sizes. Unfortunately, this scaling is starting to approach the limitations of the storage physics, making the task of maintaining the cost/density value curve increasingly difficult. In a state-of-the-art 20-nm NAND multilevel cell (MLC) memory unit, the memory state is stored using only a few tens of electrons. Increasing management of the memory bits is required for the system to be able to continue to use them. Fortunately, the ability of modern manufacturing tools to manipulate materials at the atomic level, combined with an improved understanding of and ability to model fundamental storage physics, is opening the door for new advances in memory. Emerging memory devices could prove to be even more scalable than current devices, ensuring continuation of the cost/density value curve.	adobe flash;cell (microprocessor);central processing unit;continuation;disk storage;division by two;dynamic random-access memory;electron;emergence;hard disk drive;image scaling;magnetic storage;mobile device;moore's law;multi-level cell;nand gate;period-doubling bifurcation;scalability;semiconductor industry;server (computing);smartphone;solid-state drive;static random-access memory;tablet computer;transistor	Greg Atwood;Soo-Ik Chae;Simon S.

Several C++-based general-purpose simulation tools such as systemC and CynLib have also been introduced. However, these tools are cycle-based, which simulates a system synchronously under the assumption that all modules are invoked every cycle, thus eliminating scheduling overhead. In order to simulate a system containing multiple clocks or asynchronous circuits with accuracy, an event-driven approach is highly desirable. We have developed an event-driven framework of computer system simulation in C++, called simCore, which is mainly targeted for performance evaluation simulation of computer systems, providing concurrent execution of multiple modules and event-driven module interaction mechanisms. However, in order to demonstrate its cycle-accuracy and high simulation speed, we compared two MIPS-based system simulators, one based on the C++-based event-driven simulation core and the other based on Verilog-XL.	event-driven programming;hardware description language;performance evaluation;simulation	Yoochang Jung;Yukio Chiba;Donglok Kim;Yongmin Kim	2000		10.1109/MASCOT.2000.876549	computer simulation;computer architecture;parallel computing;real-time computing;concurrent computing;asynchronous circuit;computer science;virtual machine;discrete event simulation;operating system;object-oriented programming;computational model	Metrics	6.014215063269212	52.72038912191269	5009
f4edf51d04738c1bd70762b3d15e3a4695a26113	an integrated maxfit genetic algorithm-spice framework for 2-stage op-amp design automation		The Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools have achieved high degree of maturity and reliability over the years for digital design. The design of analog circuits is a challenge attributed to the existence of multi-dimensional tradeoffs among multiple analog performance metrics like gain, bandwidth, power dissipation, supply voltage, input/output impedances, linearity, voltage swings and noise. The analog design proves to be a significant bottleneck in a System on Chip (SoC) implementation due to lack of automation techniques. To address this issue, the algorithms of the functioning of human brain or soft computing techniques can be gainfully deployed. This work proposes an integrated MaxFit Genetic Algorithm (GA) and GA-SPICE framework to achieve multi-objective optimization of analog design automation. The design of two-stage op-amp is demonstrated in this framework to optimize the objectives of open-loop DC gain, phase margin, unity gain-bandwidth, slew rate, power dissipation and area. The design is performed by proposed MaxFit GA programming of op-amp design equations in MATLAB environment and the design is transmitted seamlessly to LTspice to perform SPICE simulations for design verification. The dynamic fitness evaluation on SPICE generated performance metrics at each iteration of GA programming by transmitting them to MATLAB environment enhances the robustness of analog design significantly.	analogue electronics;capability maturity model;electronic design automation;gain–bandwidth product;genetic algorithm;input/output;iteration;logic synthesis;matlab;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;operational amplifier;phase margin;spice;scalability;simulation;soft computing;system on a chip;transmitter	V.

To find out under which circumstances the PTD contribution is significant compared to the Po, the ratio of the eTD field and the po field is evaluated as a maximum and a mean value over every direction of observation in the Keller cone, as well as in the special direction of backscattering. We employ the incremental length diffraction coefficients for a wedge with finite sized faces based on equivalent edge currents derived recently for truncated wedge strips. The numerical behaviour in the limiting cases of the diffraction coefficients are discussed extensively.	coefficient;numerical analysis;recession cone;strips	Arto Hujanen;Johan C. E.

It is usually given in the standard parametric form. However, it can also be in the forms than the standard one. For these forms, it is necessary to determine and find the standard form. In this paper, we present algorithms to determine whether a given implicit surface is a rational ruled surface. A parametrization of the surface is computed for the affirmative case. We also consider the parametric situation. More precisely, after a given rational parametric surface is determined as a ruled one, we reparameterize it to the standard form.	algorithm;computer-aided design;geometric design;implicit surface;linear algebra;monomial;whole earth 'lectronic link	Li-Yong Shen;Sonia Pérez-Díaz	2014	J.

cea81d2ea04da31773fab533747dac873e730ee9	inversion of magnetotelluric measurements using multigoal oriented hp-adaptivity	inverse problems	The inversion of magnetotelluric measurements require the computation of the quantity of interest (solution at the receivers) at different positions. Using a multigoal-oriented adaptive strategy for an hp Finite Element algorithm, we ensure accurate solutions in all receivers. With them, and using a limited memory algorithm for bound constraint optimization (L-BFGS-U method) to solve the Inverse Problem, we show that we are able to invert properly the simulated measurements in order to recover the subsurface conductivity distribution. We emphasize that the choice of the unknown of the Inverse Problem affects significantly the convergence of the inversion. We also exhibit the limitations of the electric field as the quantity of interest. When the distribution of the subsurface contains big jumps, the solution of the problem is not unique.

More precisely, for any ε > 0, we compute a rigid motion such that the area of overlap is at least 1 - ε times the maximum possible overlap. Our algorithm uses O(1/ε) extreme point and line intersection queries on P and Q, plus O((1/ε<sup>2</sup>) log(1/ε)) running time. If only translations are allowed, the extra running time reduces to O((1/ε) log(1/ε)). If P and Q are convex polygons with n vertices in total, the total running time is O((1/ε) log n + (1/ε<sup>2</sup>) log(1/ε)) for rigid motions and O((1/ε) log n + (1/ε) log(1/ε)) for translations.	algorithm;convex set;line–line intersection;time complexity	Hee-Kap Ahn;Otfried Cheong;Chong-Dae Park;Chan-Su Shin;Antoine Vigneron	2005		10.1145/1064092.1064146	extreme point;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;pattern matching;mathematics;geometry;convex set;programming language;approximation algorithm	Theory	30.882557881046065	19.239252181658834	5028

The signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) performance has been investigated for such system. A channel model that allows multirate overlapped transmission is presented based on which a closed form solution for the SIR has been derived. In addition, a simple yet very efficient block diagram of the transmitter and the receiver architecture has been proposed for such a system. Based on the proposed block diagram, the encoder-decoder has been implemented using an FPGA. Numerical results show that the newly proposed OV-CDMA scheme outperforms the classical variable processing gain fast frequency hopping CDMA (VPG-FFH-CDMA) for different system scenarios. Finally, real-time measurements have been successfully obtained using a hardware prototype utilizing the simple Xilinx Spartan IIE (XC2S200E) FPGA.	channel (communications);diagram;encoder;field-programmable gate array;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);process gain;prototype;real-time clock;simulation;spartan;transceiver;transmitter	Elie Inaty;Rafic A.

00eeabb877b36743eabf277cb029d27fb0b78b6c	fault-tolerant routing algorithm for meshes without using virtual channels	fault tolerant routing;virtual channel;wormhole routing;mesh network	We present a fault-tolerant routing algorithm which requires no virtual channels for mesh networks. Our method employs the concepts of fault rings and fault chains, which were previously used with virtual channels, to facilitate fault-tolerant routing. Typically, the number of faults that can be tolerated in a mesh without virtual channels is very small, or the number of nonfaulty nodes that must be disabled is large. The method tolerates any number of faults without disabling a large number of nonfaulty nodes. The proposed algorithm tolerates any number of faults without disabling a large number of nonfaulty nodes. Moreover, only the nodes on fault rings and fault chains need to maintain a small amount of routing information. The algorithm avoids the formation of the rightmost column segment of a circular waiting path to ensure the property of deadlock freedom. Simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our algorithm without virtual channels.	byzantine fault tolerance;computer simulation;deadlock;dijkstra's algorithm;markov chain;mesh networking;routing	Kuo-Hsuan Chen;Ge-Ming Chiu	1998	J.

Moreover, the Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) congestion control algorithm of the TCP Reno has equilibrium and dynamic problems that become more and more severe as the bandwidth-delay product increases. An ideal TCP congestion control algorithm that achieves a high utilization, a small queueing delay, a stable behavior and fairness in bandwidth allocation has been major objectives of networking research in recent years. In this paper, we propose a new congestion control protocol, called TCP KWIK, a modification to the TCP Reno for HSLD networks. TCP KWIK uses delay-based feedback information to address these problems in order to stabilize a network around a fair and efficient operating point. We argue that the delay-based approach is better than the end-to-end congestion control as the networks capacity increases. Their advantage is small at low speed but decisive at high speed. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.	tcp congestion control	Byunghun Song;Kwangsue Chung;Seung Hyong Rhee	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-25978-7_61	tcp westwood;compound tcp;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;tcp delayed acknowledgment;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;telecommunications;computer science;bic tcp;h-tcp;tcp vegas;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;scalable tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;network congestion;mobile computing;tcp acceleration;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;transport layer;computer network	Networks	-0.35672353889337094	102.28238807504354	5040

These problems can be static (one stage), dynamic with finite (multistage) or infinite horizon, single objective or multiobjective.We focus on one-stage case in multiobjective setting. Evidently, well known results from the deterministic optimization theory can be employed in the case when the “underlying” probabilitymeasure is completely known. The assumption of a complete knowledge of the probability measure is fulfilled very seldom.Consequently, we havemostly to analyze themathematicalmodels on the data base to obtain a stochastic estimate of the corresponding “theoretical” characteristics. However, the investigation of these estimates has been done mostly in one-objective case. In this paper we focus on the investigation of the relationship between “characteristics” obtained on the base of complete knowledge of the probability measure and estimates obtained on the (above mentioned) data base, mostly in the multiobjective case. Consequently we obtain also the relationship between analysis (based on the data) of the economic process characteristics and “real” economic process. To this end the results of the deterministic multiobjective optimization theory and the results obtained for stochastic one objective problems will be employed.	convex function;convex set;database;linear function;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;multistage amplifier;stochastic optimization;stochastic programming	Vlasta Kanková	2016	CEJOR	10.1007/s10100-015-0414-7	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;stochastic optimization;mathematics	Theory	34.89629540586889	4.963420231968558	5059

The basic idea is to exclude the low priority nodes in the network encoder when their channel gains towards the destination are above a threshold, and vary the threshold to provide a variable QoS. The proposed technique can provide a soft-level prioritized service to different nodes depending on their assistance needs. They are a natural generalization of current prioritized network coding techniques which can provide only a hard-level (fixed) prioritized service. We derive the outage probability for the prioritized and non-prioritized nodes in Rayleigh flat fading channel with additive white Gaussian noise and derive optimum threshold based on QoS constraints.	additive white gaussian noise;channel state information;data compression;downtime;encoder;linear network coding;quality of service;rayleigh–ritz method;relay;utility functions on indivisible goods	Navneet Malani;Sang Wu Kim	2012	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2012.052512.120771	linear network coding;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;adaptive system;signal-to-noise ratio;encoding;computer network	Mobile	34.78597470166173	78.64530264981481	5065

A number of deterministic channel access methods introduced in recent Wi-Fi standards allow to reserve a set of periodical time intervals, during which a single station can access channel without contention. Providing collision free transmission, these methods are favourable for real-time multimedia traffic which demands high quality of service (QoS). However, QoS provisioning for multimedia transmission is significantly complicated by the bursty nature of multimedia traffic and random noise inherent to wireless channels. In this paper, we propose an analytical model of multimedia transmission via periodic reservations considering both multimedia traffic bursty nature and random noise. The model can be used to find reservation parameters which allow to meet QoS requirements while transmitting multimedia data.	display resolution;mathematical model;maximal set;multicast;noise (electronics);noisy-channel coding theorem;provisioning;quality of service;real-time transcription;requirement;transmitter	Alexander S.

In this paper, bit error rate (BER) performance of FSO link using low-overhead technique i.e., aperture averaging is investigated for coherent (sub-carrier BPSK) and non-coherent (OOK) modulation schemes in weak atmospheric turbulence channel. RSoft OptSim software is used to design communication links for these modulations and simulation is done in the block mode. It is seen that aperture averaging along with coding schemes provides robust mitigation strategies. It is observed that sub-carrier BPSK modulation outperforms the other modulation scheme i.e., OOK in terms of less probability of error rate if all other parameters are kept constant or varied accordingly. Also, sensitivity of modulation schemes towards different channel parameters is observed for aperture averaging.	bit error rate;coherence (physics);modulation;overhead (computing);profiling (computer programming);simulation;subcarrier;turbulence;x.690	Aniruddh Malpani;Aditya Malpani	2012	2012 Ninth International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks (WOCN)	10.1109/WOCN.2012.6335523	telecommunications;probability;communications satellite;statistics	Mobile	41.000186630404876	78.67703383177611	5085

A genetic algorithm based optimization algorithm is also adopted to minimize the fuel consumption of the DSV. The DSV in study spends a majority of its time in dive or dynamic positioning (DP) mode, in which all four diesel generators are online to ensure redundancy and fast response to unpredictable sea conditions. Conventionally, the allocation of power generation for the diesel generators is performed via equal loading, which may not result in minimal fuel consumption. A comparison of fuel consumption in normal operation modes for the conventional LVAC and proposed LVDC architectures are performed, both with equal loading and optimization with GA. Additional constraints are then applied for fuel consumption comparisons in dive and DP operating modes.	diesel;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;microsoft sql server;operating point;operation time;software release life cycle	Merlin Chai;Lingeshwaren Sobrayen;B.

In this algorithm, multiple social features of the nodes' behaviors are utilized to quantify the nodes pairs' social links. The social links of the nodes pairs are computed based on their encounter history. These social links can be used to construct the friendship communities of the nodes. The intra-community and inter-community forwarding mechanisms are implemented to raise the successful delivery ratio with low overhead and decrease the transmission delay. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm shortens the routing delay and the overhead, and increases the successful delivery ratio, thereby improving the routing efficiency.	algorithm;link awareness;network congestion;network security;overhead (computing);routing;simulation	Kun Wang;Huang Guo;Meng Da Wu;Zhen Yang;Yan Liu	2013	2013 IEEE 77th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2013.6691872	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;virtual routing and forwarding;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	EDA	2.5299673161456813	83.51066967413314	5092

5974cb1a0567d21c53003196142126f363383b8d	optimal pilot overhead for fdd full-duplex communication and radar sensing (comsens)		In this paper, we propose and analyze new spectrum-efficient communication and radar sensing systems (named ComSens) operating in full-duplex mode with frequency division duplex scheme. ComSens simultaneously use the pilot overhead for channel estimation and radar sensing. The performances of ComSens are analyzed in terms of ergodic communication data-rate and radar estimation rate. The total system rate is optimized with respect to the pilot overhead size and the pilot powers. The numerical results show that the optimization of the pilot overhead is critical for ComSens. The radar-estimation rate increases with pilot size, pilot power, and self-interference cancellation level. With an average self-interference cancellation of 110 dB, our radar-estimation rate values are similar to the radar-estimation rate values derived for a stand-alone radar system.	channel state information;coefficient;cross section (geometry);data rate units;duplex (telecommunications);ergodicity;frequency divider;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);performance;radar;simulation;uncompressed video	Hamza Soury;Besma Smida	2017	MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)	10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170820	electronic engineering;duplex (telecommunications);radar;computer science;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;frequency divider;communication channel	Mobile	35.95304200777809	85.38038970140194	5101

A significant advance in recent years is the observation that a decomposition of the Lagrangian suggests an approach where transmissions are scheduled to minimize backpressure. However, a satisfactory Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol that can realize such a scheduling algorithm is notably missing, and that is the goal of this paper. We present a candidate random access MAC protocol that extends an existing algorithm to calculate the access probabilities. We also consider the online adaptation of access probabilities using local information about queue lengths and active links. In addition, we also modify the backpressure algorithm itself, by incorporating a minimum hop bias to alleviate the inherent problem of routing loops. We have implemented a general purpose simulation framework to study the comparative performance of network management protocols for congestion control, routing, MAC, and their cross-layer interaction. Using this, we compare the performance of our scheme with the leading schemes.	access control;communications protocol;expectation–maximization algorithm;message passing;network congestion;network utility;random access;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Robert J.

In this paper we determine, up to a constant factor, the time complexity of several approximation problems in the common parallel comparison tree model of Valiant, for all admissible values of n, p and e, where e is an accuracy parameter determining the quality of the required approximation. The problems considered include the approximate maximum problem, approximate sorting and approximate merging. Our results imply as special cases, all the known results about the time complexity for parallel sorting, parallel merging and parallel selection of the maximum (in the comparison model), up to a constant factor. We mention one very special but representative result concerning the approximate maximum problem; suppose we wish to find, among the given n elements, one which belongs to the biggest n/2, where in each round we are allowed to ask n binary comparisons. We show that log* n + O(1) rounds are both necessary and sufficient in the best algorithm for this problem.	approximation algorithm;parallel computing;sorting;time complexity	Noga Alon;Yossi Azar	1991	Combinatorica	10.1007/BF01206355	time complexity;combinatorics;polynomial-time approximation scheme;image;comparative research;mathematics;parallel algorithm;hardness of approximation;algorithmics;l-reduction;approximation algorithm;total order;algorithm	Theory	14.760537449424003	30.296522408143417	5112

This result is one of the basic blocks to prove the correctness of the finite element method which approaches the solution of partial differential equations. The exact solution is valued in a continuous volume (Hilbert space) while the approximation is valued in a mesh (finite dimensional subspace) which fits the shape of the volume. When applied to a submodule which is finite dimensional, Lax--Milgram Theorem and CÃ©a Lemma ensure the finite element method is sufficiently precise. We rely on filters as basis for topological reasoning: filters provide a very general framework to express local properties and limits. However, most such mathematical literature does not rely on filters, making our Coq formalization unusual.	approximation;basic block;coq (software);correctness (computer science);fits;finite element method;hilbert space;milgram experiment	Florian Faissole	2017	2017 19th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC)	10.1109/SYNASC.2017.00030	discrete mathematics;linear subspace;hilbert space;formal proof;correctness;finite element method;mathematical analysis;subspace topology;functional analysis;partial differential equation;mathematics	Theory	75.75685197179105	18.312393693545225	5113

The joint transmit and relay precoding design problem has been investigated for multicasting multiple data streams based on min-max mean-squared error (MSE) criterion. We aim at minimizing the maximal MSE of the signal waveform estimation among all receivers subjecting to power constraints at the transmitters and all the relay nodes. This problem is highly nonconvex with matrix variables and the exactly optimal solution is very hard to obtain. We develop an iterative algorithm to jointly optimize the transmitter, relay, and receiver matrices by solving convex subproblems. By exploiting the optimal structure of the relay precoding matrices, we then propose a low complexity solution for the problem under some mild approximation. In particular, we show that under (moderately) high signal-to-noise ratio assumption, the min-max optimization problem can be solved using the semidefinite programming technique. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.	algorithm;approximation;best, worst and average case;computational complexity theory;hop;mimo;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;maximal set;mean squared error;multicast;numerical linear algebra;optimization problem;relay;semidefinite programming;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;transceiver;transmitter;waveform	Muhammad R.

A \reversible"""" PCAAG (RPCAAG) is a backward deterministic PCAAG, and thus parsing of two-dimensional patterns can be performed without backtracking by an \inverse"""" system of the RPCAAG. Hence, a parallel pattern recognition mechanism on a deterministic cellular automaton can be directly obtained from a RPCAAG that generates the pattern set. In this paper, we investigate the generating ability of RPCAAGs and their subclass. It is shown that the ability of RPCAAGs is characterized by two-dimensional deterministic Turing machines, i.e., they are universal in their generating ability. We then investigate a monotonic RPCAAG (MRPCAAG), which is a special type of an RPCAAG that satisses monotonic constraint.

This technique is known as multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO). However, performance of MU-MIMO is sensitive towards propagation imperfections, such as time dispersion and inter-stream interference due to antenna correlation. In this paper we investigate the performance of MU-MIMO operation in 3GPP-LTE downlink transmission by employing a novel multiuser allocation, known as dynamic subcarrier allocation (DSA) that aims to minimize the effect of antenna correlation from the knowledge of the Effective Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (ESINR) metric. The suboptimal scheme is especially attractive when the number of users is large in highly correlated channel conditions where it is able to minimize the effect of spatial correlation and thereby achieve improved BER performance.	compaq lte;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;transmitter;worst-case scenario;x.690	R.

A large block length lossless turbo source encoder offers compression rates close to the source entropy, but with large latency. In this note, we propose a lossless compression technique for binary memory less sources using short block length turbo codes. To achieve compression rates close to the source entropy, we modify different components of the encoder. We focus on the design of the parity interleaver for different compression rates. Also, we replace the square shape puncturing array with a rectangular shape array that allows finer puncturing and hence improved compression rates. Finally, instead of a single code, we employ many codes operating in parallel.

It is also shown that the Torsion Theorem for elliptic curves follows directly from the WL-conjecture. Since the current proof of the Torsion Theorem for elliptic curves uses considerable machinery from arithmetic geometry, and the WL-conjecture differs from the trivial lower bound only at a constant factor, these results provide an interesting example where increasing the constant factor in a trivial lower bound of straight-line complexity is very difficult. Our results suggest that the Torsion Theorem may be viewed as a lower bound result in algebraic complexity, and a lot can be learned from the proof of the Uniform Boundedness Theorem to construct the proofs of the WL-conjecture or even the L-conjecture.	linear algebra;torsion (gastropod)	Qi Cheng	2003	computational complexity	10.1007/s00037-003-0180-0	supersingular elliptic curve;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;topology;fundamental theorem of curves;sato–tate conjecture;division polynomials;twists of curves;lenstra elliptic curve factorization;counting points on elliptic curves;mathematics;four-vertex theorem;elliptic curve;modularity theorem;upper and lower bounds;modular elliptic curve;elliptic curve point multiplication;schoof's algorithm	Theory	41.84315562784547	36.14692933963158	5147

To enable the deployment of multiple sensors in an SoC, the power and size of such sensors has been steadily reduced. Although most solutions are PNP-based [1-4], recently a low-power NPN-based current-mode thermal sensor [5] was implemented to meet the power and form-factor requirement with a robust architecture. However, since NPN devices are only available in a triple-well process, its use in low-cost dual-well processes is limited. This paper demonstrates a current-mode hybrid thermal sensor in an advanced 22nm FinFET process [6] based on subthreshold NMOS transistors and a parasitic PNP [7]. A simple voltage-based single-point soft-trimming was implemented to mitigate the sensitivity of the sensor to the subthreshold factor variability during manufacturing. Instead of placing the whole sensor system in multiple locations in a system, the hybrid architecture also supports single-element remote sensing. Only a 0.00021mm2 PNP device placed in the area of interest and a signal connection to the main sensor are then needed for temperature sensing. The sensor system achieves +/−1.07°C (±3σ) precision with 0.0043mm2 silicon area and 50uA current consumption from a 1V supply.	form factor (design);legacy plug and play;low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;nmos logic;polish notation;sensor;software deployment;spatial variability;system on a chip;systems architecture;transistor	Cho-Ying Lu;Surej Ravikumar;Amruta D.
