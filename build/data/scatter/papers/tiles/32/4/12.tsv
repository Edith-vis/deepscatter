Given the extensive adoption of social media technologies in the anorexia affected demographic, we study behavioral characteristics of this population focusing on the social media Tumblr. Aligned with observations in prior literature, we find the presence of two prominent anorexia related communities on Tumblr -- pro-anorexia and pro-recovery. Empirical analyses on several thousand Tumblr posts show use of the site as a media-rich platform replete with triggering content for enacting anorexia as a lifestyle choice. Through use of common pro-anorexia tags, the pro-recovery community however attempts to """"permeate"""" into the pro-anorexia community to educate them of the health risks of anorexia. Further, the communities exhibit distinctive affective, social, cognitive, and linguistic style markers. Compared with recover- ing anorexics, pro-anorexics express greater negative affect, higher cognitive impairment, and greater feelings of social isolation and self-harm. We also observe that these characteristics may be used in a predictive setting to detect anorexia content with 80% accuracy. Based on our findings, clinical implications of detecting anorexia related content on social media are discussed."""	cognition;sensor;social media	Munmun De Choudhury	2015		10.1145/2750511.2750515	psychology;social psychology;clinical psychology	HCI	-85.68778960489976	-19.65144789977675	167511

One of the central characteristics of this youth culture is the use of the mobile phone as a means to display or enhance one's status in the peer group. To date, however, little attention has gone out to the different uses adolescents may have for their mobile phones. Therefore, this study aims to further our understanding of the heterogeneity in adolescent mobile phone use by examining whether we can distinguish between different 'mobile lifestyles' within the Mobile Youth Culture. Drawing on a quantitative survey among 1943 Flemish adolescents (12-18years), we differentiated three lifestyles based on their attitudes towards the mobile phone as a fashion article, as a display of one's popularity and as a display of one's time scarcity. A two-step cluster procedure based on respondents' scores on these three mechanisms revealed three different segments: trendy users (N=603), engaged users (N=864) and thrifty users (N=436). These segments showed significantly different profiles in terms of socio-demographics, their use of the mobile phone in the presentation of the Self and the mobile phone's role in their friendship relationships.	mobile phone	Mariek Vanden Abeele;Marjolijn L.

50dd5a24895718b58ae7be413733a77805acf4f8	gender composition and group confidence judgment: the perils of all-male groups		We explore the joint effects of group decision making and a group’s gender composition on the calibration of confidence judgments. Participants in a laboratory experiment, individually and in groups of three, stated confidence intervals for answers to general-knowledge questions and in two types of forecasting tasks. Our results reveal that groups with at least one female member are significantly better calibrated than all-male groups. This effect is mediated by the extent to which group members share opinions and information during the group discussion. Moreover, we found that compared to a statistical aggregation of individual confidence intervals, group discussions have a mostly positive effect on judgment calibration for groups with at least one female group member, but actually harm calibration for all-male groups. Overall, our findings demonstrate that even the inclusion of just one female member into a group can have strong effects on the quality of group judgments.u0000		Steffen Keck;Wenjie Tang	2018	Management Science	10.1287/mnsc.2017.2881	psychology;genealogy;communication;social psychology	Logic	-90.09769589539775	-18.490209840903617	169177

Many of the reported cases are in the college-age and infection might have occurred through unprotected sexual behaviors. This study was to identify the effectiveness of a video-based intervention has important implications for health provider to plan evidence-based address the specific needs of college students.The research design of this study was based on TranstheoreticalModel (TTM). In addition, through an experimental design with groups: (i) to evaluate the effectiveness of a video-based intervention on the TTM stages of change,condom use self-efficacy, perceived benefits of and barriers to condom use by Taiwanese college students and (ii) to explore the factors affecting the TTM constructs for condom use. Overall, students have higher score in the pretest HIV knowledge scale, pretest self-efficacy scale and perceived benefits scale than the posttest. The score in perceived barriers scale of condom use also reduced after receiving intervention. This result shows that the videos and health education intervention can be effective in changing the college's intention to use condoms.

To improve the understanding of individuals' learning patterns, we extend prior cognition based models by incorporating emotions. Moreover, we highlight the role of perceived radicalness, which mediates the relationship between emotions and individuals' willingness to learn. The proposed research model draws from the appraisal tendency framework and includes four distinct classes of emotions: challenge, achievement, loss, and deterrence. The model was tested via a lab experiment in which participants (Nź=ź145) played an ERP simulation game. The hypothesized links were tested using structural equation modeling. Anger and excitement were negatively associated with perceived radicalness. Anxiety was positively associated with perceived radicalness and the positive effect of happiness on perceived radicalness was insignificant. Finally, perceived radicalness was positively related to individuals' willingness to learn. Results indicate that perceived radicalness is an important mechanism via which classes of emotions impact students' ERP learning behaviors. In addition, negative emotions have greater effects on radicalness perceptions compared to positive emotions. We examine perceived technology radicalness (PR) via a simulation game experiment.Emotions triggered in the early stages of IT training impact one's PR.PR mediates between one's emotional state and willingness to learn ERP systems.Negative emotions (i.e., anxiety and anger) have larger effects on PR.

It was hypothesized that selections are affected by users' ingroup minority-versus-majority status, valence of portrayals, and ingroup and outgroup membership of featured individuals, specifically among users with low or moderate self-esteem. A sample of 113 women, 30-45 years old, served to test hypotheses. Examined numeric minority groups were stay-home mothers and working women without children as, as well as working mothers as numeric majority. As predicted, the majority group avoided positive ingroup member portrayals, whereas both minority groups preferred them.	outgroup (cladistics)	Silvia Knobloch-Westerwick;Axel Westerwick	2011		10.1145/2527031.2527036	psychology;developmental psychology;communication;social psychology	HCI	-87.05735782679763	-20.315855505826345	169817

In addition, it examined how, as sojourners, Chinese international students' perceived acculturative stress varied. Data were collected from 142 Chinese international students. The results indicated that the intensity of SNS use was unable to predict individuals' perceived social capital and psychological well-being. The effect of SNS use varied according to the functions it serves. Specifically, SNS use for social and informational functions (SIF) increased individuals' levels of perceived bridging social capital and perceived life satisfaction, while SNS use for entertaining recreational functions (ERF) was unable to predict perceived social capital but increased individuals' levels of loneliness. It was also found that, in the intercultural environment, Chinese international students' levels of perceived acculturative stress were decreased by their perceived bonding social capital and increased by their perceived loneliness but had no relationship with their SNS use. Findings of the study suggest that individuals using SNSs to stay informed and connected will benefit with regard to their social network building and psychological well-being.

We attempted to extend the general strain theory to Internet addiction by exploring psychological pathways from academic stress to Internet addiction using a national and longitudinal panel study. A total of 512 adolescents completed self-reported scales for academic stress, negative emotions, and Internet addiction. We found that academic stress was positively associated with negative emotions and Internet addiction, and negative emotions were positively associated with Internet addiction. Further, the results of structural equation modeling revealed that adolescents’ academic stress had indirectly influenced Internet addiction through negative emotions. The results of this study suggest that adolescents who experience academic stress might be at risk for Internet addiction, particularly when accompanied with negative emotions. These findings provided significant implications for counselors and policymakers to prevent adolescents’ Internet addiction, and extended the general strain theory to Internet addiction which is typically applicable to deviant behavior. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Both offenders and non-offenders (or citizens) were modeled as agents living in neighborhoods, with a set of rules controlling changes in behavior based on individual experience. Offenders may become more or less inclined to actively commit criminal offenses, depending on the behavior of the neighborhood residents and other nearby offenders, and on their arrest experience. In turn, citizens may become more or less inclined to report crimes, based on the observed prevalence of criminal activity within their neighborhood. This paper describes the basic design and dynamics of the model, and how such models might be used to investigate practical crime intervention programs.		Michael A. Yonas;Jeffrey D.

2adc7820b86d9976e8ea3502ccf7e840de822f6d	bullying victimization and poor relationships with parents as risk factors of problematic internet use in adolescence		Abstract During adolescence, adolescents move away from their parents in order to establish their place in society. Therefore, there are two arenas that have a significant impact on adolescents; the family and the social one. Adolescents’ intensive internet use leads to concern about Problematic Internet Use (PIU) (Siciliano et al., 2015). Therefore, the goal of this study was to examine if stressful environments such as being a victim to bullying and/or cyberbullying, and poor relationships with parents could be linked directly and indirectly to PIU. Data was collected from a representative sample of 1000 Israeli adolescents aged 12–17 (53% females, average age 14.19 (SD = 1.34)). Measures included demographics, a short problematic internet use test, relationships with parentsu0027 questionnaire, cyberbullying scale and, separately, a traditional bullying test. Path analysis model revealed that both poor parent-child communication and being a cyberbullying victim were related to PIU. Correspondingly, Poor parent-child communication had an indirect effect on PIU through bullying and/or cyberbullying victimization. Conversely, both positive mother-child communication and positive father-child communication had an indirect effect on PIU through bullying or cyberbullying victimization, implying that good communication with parents actually can assist reducing bullying victimization and PIU behavior. Limitations, conclusions, and suggestions for further research are discussed.	internet addiction disorder	Meyran Boniel-Nissim;Hagit Sasson	2018	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2018.05.041	social psychology;psychology;the internet;demographics;path analysis model	HCI	-86.80602295995813	-21.892963910441466	172518

These include the increasing prevalence of image/video content, perceived ephemerality, anonymity, and hyperlocal communication. Based on qualitative analysis of focus groups and follow-up individual interviews with high school students, these features were found to influence the practice of cyberbullying, as well as creating negative socio-psychological effects. For example, visual data was found to be used in cyberbullying settings as evidence of contentious events, a repeated reminder, and caused a graphic impact on recipients. Similarly, perceived ephemerality of content was found to be associated with """"broken expectations"""" with respect to the apps and severe bullying outcomes for those affected.

This experiment exploredthe differences in willingness to take risks on events portrayed over the Internet via a videolink, relative to events occurring in close proximity (collocated). Thirty-four participants played a roulette game on a computer, wagering points upon the outcomes of spins of a real roulette wheel. The amounts, types of bets and the time to place them were analysed. It was found that confidence (points wagered) did not change, but people went for lower risk (when more was at stake), or thought more about the risks they took (when more was at stake) over a videolink. People accepted greater risk on outcomes occurring in close proximity, than those events portrayed over a videolink. Variations in perceived risk in response to online versus offline events probably reflect differences in the potential to influence outcomes.	computer-mediated communication	Lynette Y. Q.

The neutral observer based system forms the basis for formal medical science and relies on the science of the independent observer. In the neutral observer based system, the physician is assumed to be neutral, objective, an unbiased scientific observer of the patient. The subjectivity of the physician observations are deemed to be immeasurable or irrelevant medical information. Medical information, in the active observer based system, often taught at the patient's bedside has to grapple with the reality of the uniqueness of each patient and physician. They form an interdependent system where each of them is simultaneously an observer and also the observed. Active observations are ubiquitous in medical practice, but it has been difficult to conceptualize a method to measure and communicate. However, active observer systems can be empirically studied. We describe a set of personal and empathic measurements made by a patient and therapist in psychotherapy concerning the patient's level of functioning according to the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) using the active observer system model. The patient's GAF is rated from 4 points of view: the therapist's view (TGAF), the patient's own view (PGAF), the therapist's empathic view (TEGAF) which seeks to estimate the PGAF, the patient's empathic view (PEGAF) that seeks to estimate the TGAF. Using these ratings, this presentation will describe a method to measure the degree of accuracy of therapist's empathy, the degree of patient Over/under-idealization of the therapist's empathic capacity, and the degree of therapist Over/under-confidence concerning his or her own empathic capacity.	grapple;interdependence;relevance	Bhaskar N.

Some employees, however, use their work computers in unproductive ways as well, such as sending personal email and playing computer games. We call this Personal Use of Work Computers (PUWC). Using a work computer for personal reasons deviates from many organizations' norms. In the current study, we surveyed employees at an educational institution and asked them to report how they use their computers at work. These respondents also answered questions related to their sensation seeking, impulsiveness, conscientiousness, and job satisfaction as well as demographic information. We found that people who use their computers in unproductive ways tend to be men, younger, more impulsive, and less conscientious. We also found that those who use their computers for riskier PUWC behaviors (like viewing sexual content) tended to have sensation seeking personalities.	computers;desktop computer;email;host-seeking behavior;impulsive character (finding);job syndrome;pc game;personality;school	Wendi J.

Cyberbullying describes a pervasive form of aggressive behaviour aimed at offending victims who are unable to protect themselves. A considerable sample of Italian young people were interviewed using standardized questionnaires. The results of the current study showed that, although few subjects were affected by cyberbullying (perpetrators and victims), a relationship exists between lower levels of self-esteem and cyberbullying risks. The role of parental control represents a good opportunity for the subjects in preventing aggressive behaviour. In general, this study underlines the importance to design and realize specific didactical programs to prevent aggressive behaviour, and to increase parental awareness about cyberbullying risks.	cyberbullying	Anna Lisa Palermiti;Rocco Servidio;Maria Giuseppina Bartolo;Angela Costabile	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2016.12.026	psychology;developmental psychology;social psychology;clinical psychology	HCI	-86.50873319637189	-20.97900603148074	174313

1b7c172d46b18b828f68f1cb0cce6aa00da312c0	formation of homophily in academic performance: students prefer to change their friends rather than performance		Homophily, the tendency of individuals to associate with others who share similar traits, has been identified as a major driving force in the formation and evolution of social ties. In many cases, it is not clear if homophily is the result of a socialization process, where individuals change their traits according to the dominance of that trait in their local social networks, or if it results from a selection process, in which individuals reshape their social networks so that their traits match those in the new environment. Here we demonstrate the detailed temporal formation of strong homophily in academic achievements of high school and university students. We analyze a unique dataset that contains information about the detailed time evolution of a friendship network of 6,000 students across 42 months. Combining the evolving social network data with the time series of the academic performance (GPA) of individual students, we show that academic homophily is a result of selection: students prefer to gradually reorganize their social networks according to their performance levels, rather than adapting their performance to the level of their local group. We find no signs for a pull effect, where a social environment of good performers motivates bad students to improve their performance. We are able to understand the underlying dynamics of grades and networks with a simple model. The lack of a social pull effect in classical educational settings could have important implications for the understanding of the observed persistence of segregation, inequality and social immobility in societies.

A compensatory satisfaction theory was proposed to explain the role of need satisfaction online in pathological internet use. Cross-sectional data were collected from 4559 Chinese students from 12 to 20 years of age. The participants responded to an anonymous questionnaire concerning their internet use behavior, their perceived level of need and their need satisfaction online and offline. The results of structural equation modeling showed that pathological internet use was predicted not by the level of need, but rather by the way in which the need was satisfied. Need satisfaction perceived online predicted adolescent pathological internet use positively, while need satisfaction perceived offline predicted pathological internet use negatively. Furthermore, the direct comparison of need satisfaction online and offline showed that the advantage of need satisfaction online completely mediated the effect of unsatisfied need on adolescent pathological Internet use. Enlightenment of the theory and implications for efforts to encourage offline activities are discussed. Expand the understanding of need satisfaction in PIU.PIU was predicted not by the level of need, but rather by the way it was satisfied.Need satisfaction online predicted PIU positively.Need satisfaction offline predicted negatively.The advantage of need satisfaction online mediated the effect of unsatisfied need on PIU completely.	online and offline	Qin-Xue Liu;Xiao-Yi Fang;Jing-Jing Wan;Zong-Kui Zhou	2016	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2015.09.048	psychology;motivation;social psychology	Web+IR	-87.6646569288126	-21.557852929024286	175011

Taking an interactional approach to support requires group participants be viewed not only as targets and recipients but also as sources and providers of various types of support. An analysis was performed on the interactions of a group listserve and model of online interactional support. The aim was to explore the communication process children follow. The analysis revealed self-disclosure was used in the support group in three distinct ways. Its function for the support recipient is to initiate a transactional relationship with another member for the purpose of attracting social support through the open expression of concerns and frustrations. It is then used by the support provider to demonstrate that coping is possible for the recipient through the reciprocal self-disclosure of similar concerns and situations with which the member has successfully dealt. The third use of self-disclosure was to share reciprocal social companionship relationships.

Along with the advancement of persuasive technology and social networking technologies, the place where social interaction occurs has expanded. As a result, mediators who influence an individual's behavior change can come from diverse social channels. However, little work exists on what roles the mediators have and how differently the mediators motivate and affect the maintenance of health behavior changes of users through various social channels. To investigate this, we conducted interviews with 13 participants who use a running exercise application for maintaining their health behavior changes. This study reveals the roles of mediators from three different social channels, which are the social feature in the application, general social media, and the agent feature in the application. Mediators from the application could influence participants' health behavior change either positively or negatively according to the level of intimacy and the similarity of the physical condition. Social media mediators influence participants' social face and support their health behavior changes by keeping participants in countenance. Lastly, the agent mediator of the application provides continuous reinforcement to participants for maintaining their health behavior changes.	persuasive technology;social media	Yeoreum Lee;Youn-Kyung Lim	2015		10.1145/2675133.2685032	psychology;social relation;social science;social competence;mediator;socioeconomics;behavior change;communication;social psychology	HCI	-87.12873629956778	-18.83536947873403	176210

Experiment 1 ( N  = 116), a 2 (viewers' narcissism: narcissist vs. non-narcissist) x 4 (posts: selfies vs. groupies vs. photos taken by others vs. neutral) between-subjects factorial design, tested effects of viewers' narcissism and Instagram post sources' differential levels of narcissism manifested by different photos. Experiment 2 ( N  = 160), a 2 (posts: selfies vs. neutral) x 2 (post source: popular vs. unpopular) x 2 (viewers' need for popularity [NfP]: high vs. low) between-subjects factorial design, examined effects of the source's popularity and viewers' need for popularity. Results of Experiment 1 show selfies and groupies are interpreted as more negatively narcissistic than photos taken by other and neutral photos. Perceived similarity between the Instagram post source and the viewer mediates the causal effects of Instagram post types on attitude toward taking selfies, intention to take selfies, and intention to follow the Instagram post source. Results of Experiment 2 indicate that the post source's popularity and viewers' need for popularity interact to moderate the causal effect of post types on perceived narcissism. Envy mediates the causal effects of the post source's popularity on attitude toward taking selfies, intention to take selfies, and intention to follow the post source.	instagram	Seunga Venus Jin;Aziz Muqaddam	2018	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.11.042		HCI	-86.22365639112633	-17.036724522630287	177556

How do people use this information when initiating relationships? In the present study, participants either had access to an unknown partner's Facebook profile or did not, and were instructed to get their partners to like them in a short instant messaging conversation. Participants used social network and profile information in two ways: probes, asking questions whose answer they already knew, and implicit mentions, referencing information that made them seem more similar to their partner. These strategies successfully increased interpersonal attraction. Participants, however, frequently rated these strategies as deceptive, raising important concerns about the use of asymmetrical personal information for interpersonal gain.	instant messaging;personally identifiable information;social network	Jeffrey T.

Consequently, there is a risk of addiction to certain web applications such as social networking sites (SNSs) which are easily accessible via smartphones. There is also the risk of an increase in narcissism amongst users of SNSs. The present study set out to investigate the relationship between smartphone use, narcissistic tendencies and personality as predictors of smartphone addiction. The study also aimed to investigate the distinction between addiction specificity and co-occurrence in smartphone addiction via qualitative data and discover why people continue to use smartphones in banned areas. A self-selected sample of 256 smartphone users (Mean age = 29.2, SD = 9.49) completed an online survey. The results revealed that 13.3% of the sample was classified as addicted to smartphones. Higher narcissism scores and neuroticism levels were linked to addiction. Three themes of social relations, smartphone dependence and self-serving personalities emerged from the qualitative data. Interpretation of qualitative data supports addiction specificity of the smartphone. It is suggested smartphones encourage narcissism, even in non-narcissistic users. In turn, this increased use in banned areas. Future research needs to gather more in-depth qualitative data, addiction scale comparisons and comparison of use with and without SNS access. It is advised that prospective buyers of smartphones be pre-warned of the potential addictive properties of new technology.	prospective search;sensitivity and specificity;smartphone;web application	Claire Pearson;Zaheer Hussain	2015	IJCBPL	10.4018/ijcbpl.2015010102	psychology;psychiatry;social psychology;clinical psychology	HCI	-85.82113875954443	-19.650323263242125	180729

Experiment 1 demonstrates that messages with more forceful language, compared to messages with less forceful language, produce an overall threat to face (i.e., negative and positive face). A second experiment was conducted to replicate the findings of Experiment 1 and to extend the process model by testing the hypothesis that controlling language produces a threat to face because of the meta-communicative content (i.e., unsubstantiated claim of relative power) implied by the language selected by the source. Overall, the data provide support for a politeness theory based understanding of resistance to persuasion.

Examination of the literature containing quantitative measurements of both Facebook use and loneliness, including close variations of the definition of loneliness, produced a sample of 18 research effects (N = 8798) for review. This study asks two main questions: (1) Does using Facebook increase or decrease loneliness?; and (2) What causes what?: Does Facebook make its users lonely (or less lonely), or do lonely people (or less lonely people) use Facebook? First, researchers observed a significant overall average effect in the positive relationship between Facebook use and loneliness. Researchers also point to measurements of Facebook use as well as measurements of loneliness (and its variations) as possible moderating features or sources of variability in the relationship. Testing the relationship between Facebook use and loneliness in the context of two causal models revealed that (a) the first model outlining a path from elements of loneliness to Facebook use was not an adequate explanation of the data; whereas, (b) testing the relationship for a path in the second model from elements of Facebook use to loneliness showed results consis-	causality;emoticon;internet;social support;spatial variability	Hayeon Song;Anne Zmyslinski-Seelig;Jinyoung Kim;Adam Drent;Angela Victor;Kikuko Omori;Mike Allen	2014	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2014.04.011	psychology;the internet;meta-analysis;social media;computer science;internet privacy;social psychology;world wide web;cyberpsychology	HCI	-86.15481172903712	-19.581752910355853	181942

Information related Internet use and interactive contacts predict college students' internal political efficacy. An unexpected finding was that visiting public agency sites negatively influenced college students' external political efficacy. This implies that the quality of current public sites is below the expectation of college students and that respondents who visited those sites might develop political cynicism. This study also reveals that online news sites are becoming a primary news source for college students.

Using data from a national sample of adults in the United States, I do not find evidence for the direct effect of parenthood on the three dimensions of social capital (diversity, extensity, and quality), but instead I find evidence for its interaction effects on the quality of social capital. There is marginal evidence that parenthood status is associated with the quality of social capital positively for men but negatively for women. There is evidence that parenthood status is associated with the quality of social capital positively for the married but negatively for the unmarried. Also parenthood status is associated with the quality of social capital negatively for unmarried women but positively for the other three gender-marital groups, in particular unmarried men. These findings suggest the structural interplay of parenthood status with gender and marital status, and indicate the motherhood penalty, the fatherhood premium, the singleparenthood penalty, the married-parenthood premium, and the single-motherhood penalty in reaching higher-quality, rather than more diverse and extensive, social capital.	marginal model;social capital	Lijun Song	2012	Social Networks	10.1016/j.socnet.2011.12.005	social science;social capital;social status;social mobility;socioeconomics;sociology;social position;social psychology;social transformation	HCI	-86.67108899050046	-20.98511662886984	183266

The questionnaire was filled out twice, once with the participant's own personal responses, and a second time with what each participant imagined that his/her romantic partner's responses would be like. The data indicated that females were more prone to Facebook-evoked feelings of jealousy and to jealousy-motivated behavior than males. Males accurately predicted these sex differences in response to the jealousy scale, but females seemed unaware that their male partners would be less jealous than themselves.		Francis T.

e751c4fc326ffbb549fcc1a77541d69daecc0413	on predicting sociodemographic traits and emotions from communications in social networks and their implications to online self-disclosure		Social media services such as Twitter and Facebook are virtual environments where people express their thoughts, emotions, and opinions and where they reveal themselves to their peers. We analyze a sample of 123,000 Twitter users and 25 million of their tweets to investigate the relation between the opinions and emotions that users express and their predicted psychodemographic traits. We show that the emotions that we express on online social networks reveal deep insights about ourselves. Our methodology is based on building machine learning models for inferring coarse-grained emotions and psychodemographic profiles from user-generated content. We examine several user attributes, including gender, income, political views, age, education, optimism, and life satisfaction. We correlate these predicted demographics with the emotional profiles emanating from user tweets, as captured by Ekman's emotion classification. We find that some users tend to express significantly more joy and significantly less sadness in their tweets, such as those predicted to be in a relationship, with children, or with a higher than average annual income or educational level. Users predicted to be women tend to be more opinionated, whereas those predicted to be men tend to be more neutral. Finally, users predicted to be younger and liberal tend to project more negative opinions and emotions. We discuss the implications of our findings to online privacy concerns and self-disclosure behavior.	blood glucose self-monitoring;demography;emotions;happiness;inference;internet privacy;machine learning;sadness;self disclosure;social media;social network;thinking, function;trait;user-generated content;virtual reality	Svitlana Volkova;Yoram Bachrach	2015	Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking	10.1089/cyber.2014.0609	psychology;multimedia;social psychology	Web+IR	-85.30168272174225	-19.162916534852506	184475

Four hundred eighty-three Taiwanese high school students were surveyed during March 2002. The results indicated that intention increased with positive attitude toward visiting Internet cafés, the intention was only rarely affected by significant others, intention strengthened with the quantity of resources and skills perceived, and past behavior negatively influenced the intention. Three conclusions were drawn: (a) The proposed model can effectively predict adolescent intention to visit Internet cafés. (b) Past behavior was the main predictor of intention. (3) In terms of intention to visit Internet cafés, there is a strengthening of individualism and a weakening of normative influences. Finally, suggestions and recommendations were made for practice and future research.	eighty;emoticon;kerrison predictor;optimism	Yi-Chung Hsu;Tai-Kuei Yu	2007	Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society	10.1089/cpb.2007.9983	psychology;social psychology	Web+IR	-86.78848761551623	-21.56009321250743	184649

More specifically, we estimate versions of the three key relations from his framework using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) Survey. Our primary models provide evidence that skills are related to involvement in cognate activities with a parent, indicating a behavioural relationship between capabilities and activities which is not explicit in Sen’s original set-up, but is key to the development and happiness of young children. A second set of models indicates that the daily activities of very young children are related to household income but that in some cases the association with parenting inputs is stronger. Thirdly, we report happiness regressions for the children which seem to suggest that shopping and reading are valued but that their distribution is limited in some cases – probably either by household income or parental education. Across the piece, we find that the number of siblings is negatively related to activity involvement with parents, as hypothesised by Becker, but positively related to everyday, motor and social skills. Combined with evidence from other studies, we conclude that the capability approach provides a useful framework for understanding the economics of wellbeing across the entire life course.

Content analysis was conducted with reference to five types of social support (information support, tangible assistance, esteem support, network support, and emotional support) on 85 threads (1,138 messages). Our analysis revealed that many of the messages offered informational and emotional support, followed by esteem support and network support, with tangible assistance the least frequently offered. Results suggest that this online support group is a popular forum through which individuals living with HIV/AIDS can offer social support. Our findings have implications for health care professionals who support individuals living with HIV/AIDS.		Phoenix K. H. Mo;Neil S.

When shocks occur, individuals often rely on resources embedded within informal insurance networks. Resource access is related to network position and reflected in properties such as centrality and reachability. We analyze a complete informal lending network (188 nodes, 295 ties) among the Sidama, an agro-pastoralist population in southwestern Ethiopia. Results indicate that culturally salient indicators of wealth, such as cattle ownership and gender, largely account for network structure. Analysis of a complete network further allows us to discuss the impact of global network properties, such as overall typology, on a communities response to different types of shocks (covariate and idiosyncratic). These findings extend our understanding of how individuals and communities engage informal lending networks in response to exogenous shocks.

To date, however, most studies have addressed only coarse-grained effects of metaphor framing, leaving many questions unanswered about the relative power of metaphor compared to more literal linguistic framing devices. We addressed this issue in a large, pre-registered framing study, comparing the effects of describing the role of police officers as (a) metaphorical guardians of a community (b) literal protectors of a community, and (c) a no-label control. We found no main effect of framing condition, suggesting that positively valenced metaphors may exert little influence on their own in this domain. However, we did observe an interaction between condition and political ideology, such that the guardian metaphor was especially effective at improving attitudes towards police officers for liberals, whose initial approval ratings were relatively low.	emoticon;framing (world wide web);framing (social sciences);interface metaphor;literal (mathematical logic);noise shaping	Paul H.

Learning lifelong and adult education are strategies that aim to achieve social, cultural and economic development [4]. They are, undoubtedly, strategies that have a positive impact on society. Intergenerational learning is a practice that allows us to include not only the older, as far as the younger population, benefiting from this strategy two disparate generations. Learning throughout life, through intergenerational sociability, has added value, encourages the closeness between the generations: the younger ones, develop a positive image and value the knowledge and skills of the older generations contradicting the myths rooted in society related to aging. At the same time, they acquire scholarship and life experiences from older people, which contributes to the general education of younger people. However, also the elderly benefit from these strategies because they also feel the positive impact of intergenerational learning: well-being and independence, improved self-esteem, with confidence in the future and sense of usefulness and value.	centrality;experience;intergenerational struggle;whole earth 'lectronic link	Ricardo Pocinho;Pedro Belo;Eva T.

Employing a unique study design that allows creating matrices of social distance (based on demographic characteristics) between 11 residents on each of over 650 blocks at three time points, we find that more socially distant residents perceive more disorder than their neighbors. Consistent with the bridging social capital literature, overall social distance in the block has a curvilinear relationship with perceived crime. And blocks with two cohesive subgroups, based on social distance, have lower levels of perceived disorder.		John R.

Yet individuals often do not seek feedback. Because feedback can be evaluatively negative, people avoid face-to-face seeking to reduce the risk of damaging one's self-concept and ego. Information technology can conceivably mitigate some of these risks in seeking. Because computermediated feedback mechanisms such as electronic mail and computer-generated feedback mechanisms as in performance monitoring systems reduces the personal delivery of evaluative feedback, these mechanisms should induce a greater desire for, and promote a higher frequency of, feedback seeking. A laboratory experiment was designed to examine the effects of face-to-face, computer-mediated, and computer-generated feedback channels on feedback seeking behavior. Individuals in the computermediated or computer-generated conditions sought more feedback than those in the face-to-face condition. Task performance, however, was not significantly related to the amount of feedback requested. We discuss the differences in feedback seeking in terms of changes in social contextual cues mitigated by information technology during feedback seeking sessions.	computer-generated holography;computer-mediated communication;email;negative feedback;organizational behavior	Soon Ang;Detmar W.

This investigation focused on the use of home computers for educational purposes. It compared computer anxiety in adolescents with and without a history of special needs related to language difficulties. Participants were 55 17-year-olds with specific language impairment (SLI) and 72 typically developing (TD) peers. Participants completed interviews regarding computer anxiety as well as computer importance and computer enjoyment. Measures of psycholinguistic skills, perceived ease of use and general anxiety were also obtained. Results showed that adolescents with SLI experience more computer anxiety than TD peers and that females are more anxious than males. Level of general anxiety, perceived ease of use and language ability had a direct association and were predictive of level of computer anxiety in adolescents with SLI. In contrast, only perceived ease of use was significantly predictive in TD adolescents. Gender was not a significant predictor in the context of other influential variables. The findings reveal a complex relationship between linguistic, attitudinal and emotional factors and computer anxiety.

By looking at these opinions (satisfaction versus dissatisfaction) in relation to certain features of internships as well as to the more general labour market regulatory framework, this project aims to give a voice to young people, enabling them (indirectly) to provide policy suggestions to law-makers. Furthermore, we propose a preview of a possible empirical model for data collection based on the manual coding of Tweets. By employing a Probit regression and Blinder-Oaxaca and Fairlie decompositions, we have tried to establish a link between the perceived evaluation of internships and the country where the internship is based, the latter being used as a proxy for the legal system. In all our tests we found that the country in which the internship is placed is the main factor in the positive or negative perception. Ultimately we shall propose the use of Twitter not only as a relevant research tool, but also as an instrument for bringing young people’s needs to the attention of law-makers.

650861c9ab120bb72c2d64e85a9893b95c06ee30	narrative framing of consumer sentiment in online restaurant reviews		The vast increase in online expressions of consumer sentiment offers a powerful new tool for studying consumer attitudes. To explore the narratives that consumers use to frame positive and negative sentiment online, we computationally investigate linguistic structure in 900,000 online restaurant reviews. Negative reviews, especially in expensive restaurants, were more likely to use features previously associated with narratives of trauma : negative emotional vocabulary, a focus on the past actions of third person actors such as waiters, and increased use of references to “we” and “us”, suggesting that negative reviews function as a means of coping with service–related trauma. Positive reviews also employed framings contextualized by expense: inexpensive restaurant reviews use the language of addiction to frame the reviewer as craving fatty or starchy foods. Positive reviews of expensive restaurants were long narratives using long words emphasizing the reviewer’s linguistic capital and also focusing on sensory pleasure . Our results demonstrate that portraying the self, whether as well–educated, as a victim, or even as addicted to chocolate, is a key function of reviews and suggests the important role of online reviews in exploring social psychological variables.	framing (world wide web)	Daniel Jurafsky;Victor Chahuneau;Bryan R.

In so doing, others’ responses were shown as either individual comments or aggregate approval ratings of the article, and the individual’s need for cognition (NFC) was considered as a potential moderator of their relative effects. High NFC individuals relied more on the approval ratings than individual postings in estimating media influence on general public, but low NFC individuals’ presumption about media influence remained unaltered, regardless of how others’ reactions were presented. However, exposure to dissenting comments led both high and low NFC individuals to perceive the public opinion as more discrepant from the news position, with no corresponding effect for approval ratings. Others’ comments significantly affected participants’ personal opinion, but only for those less prone to engage in analytical thinking.

We perform this study on the US presidential debates and show that a candidate’s power, modeled after their poll scores, affects how often he/she attempts to shift topics and whether he/she succeeds. We ensure the validity of topic shifts by confirming, through a simple but effective method, that the turns that shift topics provide substantive topical content to the interaction.	effective method;interaction;off topic;text segmentation	Vinodkumar Prabhakaran;Ashima Arora;Owen Rambow	2014		10.3115/v1/W14-2514	artificial intelligence;data mining	Web+IR	-89.92773105575488	-19.088023009139608	191353

Distinguishing interpersonal from broadcast messages in computer-mediated communication (CMC) may be an important individual tactic for avoiding information overload and filtering spam; however, we found no existing measures suitable for assessing these factors in CMC. This deficiency motivated the present study to develop and validate feedback and coherence questionnaire measures and conduct an initial test of the relevance of these measures to CMC. The measures met recommended criteria for content validity, construct validity, reliability, and predictive validity. In addition, the measures predicted most of the variance in social presence subjects perceived in our test messages and entirely mediated effects of whether the purported message sender was known or unknown to our subjects. These findings suggest feedback and coherence are important antecedents to persuasion in email, texting, instant messaging and similar forms of CMC.	angular defect;computer-mediated communication;definition;email filtering;error message;feedback;information overload;instant messaging;relevance;reliability engineering;social presence theory;spamming	E.

Unfortunately there is an inclination towards violence and other objectionable scenes in cartoon videos that have very bad impact on the developing personality of children. Extensive use of such violent scenes is one of the factors of increase of violence in society. Parents rely on cartoons as a mean of amusement for their children without analyzing its content which can pose serious negative impacts on child behavior. To protect children from violent content means are require for automatic detection of violence content in cartoon videos. In this paper different low-level visual features are evaluated for violence detection in cartoon videos using indigenously developed dataset that is categorized as violent and non-violent. From our results it has been observed that low-level visual features could not be used efficiently for the detection of violence. However these features are very helpful in identifying the character and situation that if combined with a knowledgebase capability can be used for detection of violence and other objectionable elements in the cartoon videos.	baseline (configuration management);categorization;high- and low-level;information;knowledge base;microsoft visio;television	Tahira Khalil;Javed Iqbal;Awais Adnan	2016	2016 Sixth International Conference on Innovative Computing Technology (INTECH)		psychology;computer vision;multimedia;advertising	Robotics	-85.13801116650328	-19.238773230284938	193313
d70b2e0ec5a4a332f853c5b9a87241aa621370fa	interconnected but underprotected? parents' methods and motivations for information seeking on digital safety issues		Parents need information and skills to meet the demands of mediating connected technology in their homes. Parents' methods and motivations for learning to protect children from digital risks were reported through a survey. This study explores relationships between information seeking, parents' concerns, risks children have experienced, and access to connected devices, in addition to the use and satisfaction of various digital safety resources. Three types of information-seeking behavior were identified: (a) protective information seeking, to protect children from being confronted with harmful content; (b) problem-solving information seeking, to help children who have been negatively affected by connected technology; and (c) attentive learning, by attending to media resources passively encountered on this topic. Friends and family are the dominant source of digital safety information, followed by presentations and the Internet. Parents' top concerns for their children using connected technology were accidental exposure to pornography, and sexual content in Internet-based entertainment. Higher numbers of risks experienced by children were positively associated with parents' problem-solving information seeking and level of attentive learning. Parents who were more concerned exhibited more problem-solving information seeking; but despite the high level of concern for children's safety online, 65 percent of parents seek information on this subject less than twice per year. Children have access to a mean of five connected devices at home; a higher number of devices was correlated with increased risks experienced by children, but was not associated with increased concern or information seeking from parents.

Rather than looking at Internet addiction per se, this study focused on particular activities on the Internet that might be potentially addictive and linked them to personality traits that might predispose individuals to Internet addiction. The aims of this study were (i) to assess the prevalence of clinically significant levels of Internet addiction, and to (ii) discern the interplay between personality traits and specific Internet uses in increasing the risk for Internet addiction. This cross-sectional online survey used data from 2,257 students of an English university. Results indicated that 3.2% of the students were classified as being addicted to the Internet. The included personality traits and uses of online activities explained 21.5% of the variance in Internet addiction. A combination of online shopping and neuroticism decreased the risk for Internet addiction, whereas a combination of online gaming and openness to experience increased it. In addition to this, frequent usage of online shopping and social online activities, high neuroticism and low agreeableness significantly increased the chances of being addicted to the Internet.

Sixty-eight fourth-graders participated in this study. A synchronous gaming learning system was developed to have dyads compete against each other in answering multiple-choice questions set in accordance with the school curriculum in two conditions (face-to-face and anonymous). The results showed that students who were exposed to the anonymous team competition condition responded significantly more positively than those in the face-to-face condition in terms of motivation and satisfaction at the 0.050 and 0.056 levels respectively. Although further studies regarding the effects of anonymous interaction in a networked gaming learning environment are imperative, the positive effects detected in this preliminary study indicate that anonymity is a viable feature for mitigating the negative effects that competition may inflict on motivation and satisfaction as reported in traditional face-to-face environments.	imperative programming;learning disorders;real-time transcription	Fu-Yun Yu;Chialing Han;T M Vanessa Chan	2008	Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society	10.1089/cpb.2007.0171	psychology;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;multimedia;social psychology	HCI	-87.88747794037958	-21.86468960992285	195966
b19ef096942911d17d77830f40a0a094921e45a4	spatio-temporal analysis of reverted wikipedia edits		Little is known about what causes anti-social behavior online. The paper at hand analyzes vandalism and damage in Wikipedia with regard to the time it is conducted and the country it originates from. First, we identify vandalism and damaging edits via ex post facto evidence by mining Wikipedia’s revert graph. Second, we geolocate the cohort of edits from anonymous Wikipedia editors using their associated IP addresses and edit times, showing the feasibility of reliable historic geolocation with respect to country and time zone, even under limited geolocation data. Third, we conduct the first spatiotemporal analysis of vandalism on Wikipedia. Our analysis reveals significant differences for vandalism activities during the day, and for different days of the week, seasons, countries of origin, as well as Wikipedia’s languages. For the analyzed countries, the ratio is typically highest at nonsummer workday mornings, with additional peaks after break times. We hence assume that Wikipedia vandalism is linked to labor, perhaps serving as relief from stress or boredom, whereas cultural differences have a large effect. Our results open up avenues for new research on collaborative writing at scale, and advanced technologies to identify and handle antisocial behavior in online communities.	country life;geolocation;image noise;online community;sensor;social media;wikipedia	Johannes Kiesel;Martin Potthast;Matthias Hagen;Benno Stein	2017			information retrieval;data mining;computer science;spatio-temporal analysis	HCI	-85.30700924156714	-20.56838380330265	196045
0b0a530df04065320ca3c1040c7f1ed6a2be1cb4	using social media to measure student wellbeing: a large-scale study of emotional response in academic discourse		Student resilience and emotional wellbeing are essential for both academic and social development. Earlier studies on tracking students’ happiness in academia showed that many of them struggle with mental health issues. For example, a 2015 study at the University of California Berkeley found that 47% of graduate students suffer from depression, following a 2005 study that showed 10% had considered suicide. This is the first large-scale study that uses signals from social media to evaluate students’ emotional wellbeing in academia. This work presents fine-grained emotion and opinion analysis of 79,329 tweets produced by students from 44 universities. The goal of this study is to qualitatively evaluate and compare emotions and sentiments emanating from students’ communications across different academic discourse types and across universities in the U.S. We first build novel predictive models to categorize academic discourse types generated by students into personal, social, and general categories. We then apply emotion and sentiment classification models to annotate each tweet with six Ekman’s emotions – joy, fear, sadness, disgust, anger, and surprise and three opinion types – positive, negative, and neutral. We found that emotions and opinions expressed by students vary across discourse types and universities, and correlate with survey-based data on student satisfaction, happiness and stress. Moreover, our results provide novel insights on how students use social media to share academic information, emotions, and opinions that would pertain to students academic performance and emotional well-being.	categorization;computer science;discourse types;geolocation;predictive modelling;sadness;social media;uc browser	Svitlana Volkova;Kyungsik Han;Courtney Corley	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-47880-7_32	social psychology	HCI	-85.25239450313136	-19.765714283150032	196783

Can this phenomenon of behavioral contagion be seen in the workplace? Using employees' organizational social media data and their workplace hierarchical network structure, we studied contagion across a large multinational corporation, focusing on an important workplace behavior - employee engagement. We measured employees' engagement based on their word choice in organizational social media, and we applied a longitudinal statistical technique which controls for homophily, employees' traits and prior expressions of engagement. We found that engagement and disengagement spread from one employee to another with direct peers exerting the strongest influence. While engagement-spread was more powerful laterally among people at the same organizational level, disengagement-spread followed the vertical managerial chain. Further, we found that disengaged co-workers exerted a stronger influence on employee's future engagement compared to the engaged co-workers. Our results suggest the need for organizations to sense and address workplace disengagement promptly. Moreover, our findings offer opportunities for using workplace interventions to promote engagement and mitigate disengagement.	behavioral contagion;social media;tree network	Tanushree Mitra;Michael J.

These societies are thought to respond adaptively to changes in the physical and social environment, and are thus ideal for testing hypotheses about the evolutionary forces that shape sociality. However, few models have been developed to measure and explain fissionfusion dynamics. Here we isolate several key components of the social behavior of wild African elephants (Loxodonta africana) using a bilinear mixed effects model, proposed by Peter Hoff (J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 100(469):286–295, 2005). The model enables inference on environmental effects, such as rainfall and seasonality, and is flexible enough to include predictors of pairwise affiliation, such as kinship, which allows large-mammal ecologists to test assumptions about elephant social structure and to develop new theories of why and how elephants interact. In addition, this model includes an unobserved latent social space to represent the interactions between elephants not incorporated by the measured covariates.	bilinear filtering;interaction;seasonality;singlet fission;social network;social structure;theory	Eric A.

Edit wars can last from a few days to several years before reaching consensus often leading to a loss of content quality. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to create an agent-based model of edit wars in order to study the influence of various factors involved in consensus formation. We model the behavior of agents using theories of group stability and reinforcement learning. We show that increasing the number of credible or trustworthy agents and agents with a neutral point of view decreases the time taken to reach consensus, whereas the duration is longest when agents with opposing views are in equal proportion. Our model can be used to study the behavior of members in online communities and to inform policies and guidelines for participation.	agent-based model;cognition;natural language processing;online community;reinforcement learning;social simulation;trustworthy computing;user-generated content;wiki;wikipedia	Arun Kalyanasundaram;Wei Wei;Kathleen M.

Voice therapy has been found to help improve voice and speech in individuals with PD, but the majority of these individuals do not enroll in voice therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether watching short videos about voice symptoms and treatment in Parkinson's disease influences readiness to change, stages of change, and self-efficacy in individuals with PD. Eight individuals with PD participated in the study. Fifteen videos were chosen, three representing each of the five stages of change. We chose videos from YouTube that represented variety in speakers, content, and genre. We found that readiness to change significantly increased after watching videos, suggesting that watching videos helped these individuals move closer to actively improving their voice and speech. In addition, five of the eight participants showed forward movement in stages of change. Finally, self-efficacy demonstrated a positive trend following video watching. Overall, our results demonstrate that watching videos available on the internet can influence individuals with Parkinson's disease in changing vocal behavior.

Most studies focus on the positive aspects of flow experience and its effect on performance. In stark contrast, gambling research focusing on the negative side of addiction lacks an in-depth investigation of gamblers' (positive) flow encounters. This separation of research lines seems out of place given that recent research indicates connections between flow and addiction. Joining both constructs in a causal-effects model helps one gain a better understanding of their relationship and its contingencies. This article empirically investigates whether and how it is possible to observe a """"Janus face"""" of flow with its various sub-dimensions in online gambling. Empirical data were collected from 500 online gamblers by applying a structured questionnaire with established scales. The data were analyzed with a confirmatory factor analysis and a double-hurdle model to separate casual gamblers who are unsusceptible to any addiction issues from gamblers affected by initiatory addiction issues. The findings indicate that online gambling addiction is negatively influenced by two sub-dimensions of flow experience, namely a sense of control and concentration on the task at hand, whereas it is enhanced by a transformation of time and autotelic experience."""	addictive behavior;causality;confirmatory factor analysis;dimensions;gambling;gambling, pathological;internet;janus;munchausen syndrome;performing arts;sports	Rohit H.

16d43299deea88ae372d846b751fe7c664852c4c	priming to induce paranoid thought in a non clinical population		Freeman et al. reported that a substantial minority of the general population has paranoid thoughts while exposed in a virtual environment. This suggested that in a development phase of a virtual reality exposure system for paranoid patients initially a non-clinical sample could be used to evaluate the system's ability to induce paranoid thoughts. To increase the efficiency of such an evaluation, this paper takes the position that when appropriately primed a larger group of a non-clinical sample will display paranoid thoughts. A 2-by-2 experiment was conducted with priming for insecurity and vigilance as a within-subject factor and prior-paranoid thoughts (low or high) as a between-subjects factor. Before exposure into the virtual world, participants (n=24) were shown a video and read a text about violence or about mountain animals. While exposed, participants were asked to comment freely on their virtual environment. The results of the experiment confirmed that exposure in a virtual environment could induce paranoid thought. In addition, priming with an aim to create a feeling of insecurity and vigilance increased paranoid comments in the non-clinical group that otherwise would less often exhibit ideas of persecution.	large;norm (social);patients;priming exercise;thinking, function;violence;virtual reality;virtual world;insecurity	Reza Giga Isnanda;Willem-Paul Brinkman;Wim Veling;Mark Van Der Gaag;Mark A.

Jerome As computer use becomes prevalent at work and in leisure pursuits it presents a potential barrier to regular physical activity. However an individual’s confidence in overcoming such barriers may moderate the relationship between computer use and physical activity levels. This study examined the associations among computer use, self-efficacy in overcoming barriers to exercise, and physical activity levels among adult computer users. Participants (N = 615) were recruited through national email and newsletters announcements, and completed standardized self-report questionnaires online. Computer use was not associated with meeting physical activity guidelines (adjusted odds ratio, AOR = 0.63–1.00, n.s.). Among leisure computer users, the moderate efficacy group (AOR = 3.72, 95% CI = 1.59–8.69) and the high efficacy group (AOR = 5.31, 95% CI = 2.37–11.91) had higher odds of meeting physical activity guidelines compared to the low efficacy group. Among the work related computer users, the high efficacy group (AOR = 2.83, 95% CI = 1.18–6.77) had higher odds of meeting physical activity guidelines than the low efficacy group. These results suggest that barriers posed by high levels of computer use are surmountable. Efforts to increase efficacy in overcoming barriers to exercise may be more practical and have a greater impact on physical activity levels than trying to decrease computer use among adults. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To do this a study was conducted, in which 1486 young people aged from 9 to 16 took part. After grouping risk behaviors into five areas, the results indicate that young people have a greater perception of the risk related to the publication of data and photographs. It should be stressed that significant differences were found with respect to age and sex. Cluster analysis shows the existence of a group with a low perception of risk, made up largely of older boys. Finally, the data suggests the need to encourage ethical and technical training for young people regarding the use of technology, specially focused on the aforementioned group.
