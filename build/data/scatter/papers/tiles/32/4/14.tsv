d2e2d219e6585843dcefda39a3e7bf245d6fbb61	trust in digital currency enabled transactions model	trust;business to consumer;e commerce;digital currency;bitcoin	This research extends theories of trust from e-commerce to incorporate digital currencies. In particular trust in business to consumer e-commerce transactions carried out using digital currencies such as Bitcoin is explored. A model of online trust is considered to be valid in this different transaction context but the significance of each construct changes and some extensions are necessary. The role of institutional trust in transactions has differences that are explored and new constructs are suggested. These new constructs are incorporated into a new digital currency enabled transactions trust model. The results support the validity of the role of the rate of adoption and reputation of digital currencies as part of situational normality. The nature of the digital currency itself, the digital currency payment system, the payment intermediary, the digital currency P2P infrastructure, self-imposed and external regulation are also considered valid as part of structural assurance. These findings can be used by those developing the related technology, the vendors and regulatory institutions to increase consumer trust in digital currency enabled transactions in order to extend adoption and use.	bitcoin;digital currency;e-commerce;peer-to-peer	Alex Zarifis;Xusen Cheng;Salomi Dimitriou;Leonidas Efthymiou	2015			virtual currency;marketing;business;commerce	HCI	-85.8398930832727	-6.132054435277788	161792

In this paper, a cross-disciplinary model, established with established critical factors derived from traditional information systems models and the means-end chain approach, is used to explore what affects customers' willingness to pay for MDS. In addition, the hybrid framework highlights the multiple attributes of MDS, user's multiple dimensions of needs and multiple purposes for adopting MDS. Testing the model with survey data collected from 271 MDS users, the research shows that users' perceived benefits of MDS most significantly explain their desire and demand for MDS. Financial indicators (e.g., affordability and income) also play an important role in determining users' willingness to spend on MDS. Past experiences slightly affect users' willingness to spend on MDS. While gender makes a difference, age and education do not show such a significant effect.	experience;html5 in mobile devices;information system	Cong Kristy Shi;Xiaoming Hao;Ravi S.

This study provides qualitative analysis and assessment of the multidimensional impacts of the recent proposals of introducing Assured Service Quality (ASQ) in the Internet interconnection (IC) market. The analysis focuses on the impacts in three distinct, though strongly interrelated aspects: Business, Socioeconomic and Regulatory. Methodologically, the impacts are identified through a focus group which involved representatives from 17 European organizations. Exploring how these complementary impacts may affect the ASQ offer is fundamental for envisioning the Internet evolution and for setting appropriate governance policies. This study identifies and discusses the expected impacts, thus shedding light on the key implications of assured quality Internet interconnection.	best-effort delivery;bilateral filter;focus group;interconnection;internet	Antonio Ghezzi;Raffaello Balocco;Manos Dramitinos	2013		10.1145/2507248.2507253	regulation;the internet;computer science;interconnection;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-89.09254642178288	-6.423187867199594	162463
d220bdca1ec29588a97d7d57c9e413b26eb76b86	acceptance and willingness to pay for mobile tv apps		In recent years, smart phone market has risen and the demands of mobile applications increase sharply. Daily mobile applications have shown their great potential and influences throughout mobile commerce. Mobile TV app is one of the most popular mobile applications in the entertainment genre. Advances in 4G mobile network make high-quality mobile TV and video streaming apps prospective. With the emergence of mobile TV apps, there is a pressing need to understand the determinants of users' intention to use and willingness to pay. This study aims to advance our understanding of the factors that influence the intention to use and willingness to pay for mobile TV apps by triangulating the social cognitive theory, motivation theory and the notion of perceived value. An empirical survey of 497 subjects who have used the mobile TV app was conducted to examine our proposed model. The results reveal that interpersonal/external social influence, personal mobile innovativeness, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment and perceived utilitarian/hedonic value significantly affect an individual's intention to use mobile TV apps, while mobile-specific self-efficacy does not. On the other hand, perceived utilitarian value and perceived hedonic value influence a user’s willingness to pay. Theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed.	emergence;mobile app;mobile commerce;mobile television;prospective search;smartphone;streaming media	Chen-Ya Wang;Hsia-Ching Chang;Seng-cho Timothy Chou;Fung-Fei Chen	2013			marketing;advertising;internet privacy	HCI	-88.44657769617265	-9.646769559518571	163376

Thus, a number of studies have investigated user acceptance of e-government through the use of adoption models, such as the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. However, these models do not focus sufficiently on security. In order to develop a more security-focused adoption model for investigating user acceptance of e-government, it is important to first understand the security challenges that may inhibit the adoption of e-government. This paper considers these security challenges based on the end user's perspective, identifying the extent of the challenges. For example, 85.5% of the participants agree that there is a lack of user awareness. In addition, 62.4% of the participants believe that culture plays an important role in e-government security. Also, 49.8% of the participants are worried about privacy when using e-government services.	display resolution;e-government;privacy	Nawaf Alharbi;Maria Papadaki;Paul Dowland	2014	The 9th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST-2014)	10.1109/ICITST.2014.7038781	computer security model;standard of good practice;public relations;cloud computing security;critical security studies;security through obscurity;security information and event management;security convergence;knowledge management;information security;human-computer interaction in information security;security service;business;network security policy;commerce	EDA	-86.60624999566934	-8.224962088732811	163772

However, several previous studies point out that TAM may not effectively explain the adoption process of complex information technologies. This study manifests the limitations of TAM and suggests a new research model that incorporates the concept of perceived behavioral control from the theory of planned behavior into TAM. Further, this study compares the two models in the case of acceptance of object-oriented programming. The results support the view that the perceived behavioral control concept should be employed to better predict the relationship between external variables and acceptance of the technology. Overall, the model developed in this study is significantly better than TAM in explaining the acceptance process of object-oriented programming. This study shows that length of training, organizational support, and personal experience are significant predictors of acceptance of object-oriented programming.	ibm tivoli access manager	Injai Kim	2004			computer science;knowledge management;inductive programming;programming language;object-oriented programming	HCI	-90.54343886806105	-3.0091090915661334	164027

To provide a real-world testbed to study the impact of novel mobile crowd-sourcing strategies, we have designed, developed and experimented with a real-world mobile crowd-tasking platform on the SMU campus, called TA&Sslash;Ker. We enhanced the TA$Ker platform to support several new features (e.g., task bundling, differential pricing and cheating analytics) and experimentally investigated these features via a two-month deployment of TA$Ker, involving 900 real users on the SMU campus who performed over 30,000 tasks. Our studies (i) show the benefits of bundling tasks as a combined package, (ii) reveal the effectiveness of differential pricing strategies and (iii) illustrate key aspects of cheating (false reporting) behavior observed among workers.	authorization;crowdsourcing;elasticity (data store);experiment;fairness measure;last mile;logistics;microsoft windows;mobile app;product bundling;software deployment;system management unit;testbed	Thivya Kandappu;Nikita Jaiman;Randy Tandriansyah;Archan Misra;Shih-Fen Cheng;Cen Chen;Hoong Chuin Lau;Deepthi Chander;Koustuv Dasgupta	2016		10.1145/2971648.2971690	embedded system;simulation;human–computer interaction;operating system;multimedia;empirical research;computer security;computer network	HCI	-89.45956518050679	-8.031238656460262	164381

A cross-country examination using regression shows that Internet use is constrained by structural as well as cost factors. Field data from interviews of over 200 academics in 10 universities in Kenya and Nigeria confirmed much of the aggregate country level findings. Our study found that initial investment cost of end-user equipment limits the ownership of PCs, compelling academics to seek Internet access in cyber cafes and other public places.	internet access	Banji Oyelaran-Oyeyinka;Catherine Nyaki Adeya	2004	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/S0736-5853(03)00023-6	public relations;empirical evidence;internet access;marketing;advertising;exploratory research;commerce	ML	-87.85085951740503	-8.719406325358236	164542

The use of computers in organizations may be influenced by both technical and social factors. In addition, the way in which these factors operate in any specific organization may be affected by the particular type of computer being used. This paper reports the results of semistructured interviews with users of Apple Macintosh computers in three different organizations. The relevance of factors identified in earlier interviews with academic Macintosh users to the use of microcomputers in the business context is considered. It was found that, while there was considerable individual variation in attitudes to microcomputer use, many of the factors identified in the earlier study were also present in the business organizations. Some reasons for the attitudes found are discussed.	microcomputer	Michael R Jones	1994	Inf. Syst.

d05d07e8d52a6aa9829f96f6b884d41b5be235e6	an empirical assessment of user perceptions of feature versus application level usage		Users often use application software because of particular features. However, little remains known on whether user perceptions of application use is merely feature-driven or whether users perceive their application use as being more than an amalgamation of features. As the software industry ushers trends such as Web services, it becomes evermore important for vendors and users alike to clarify how users perceive features and applications. The paper is an attempt to confirm whether users can perceptively unbundle application software features from the overall applications themselves. Using a modified version of the repertory grid technique, this study investigates user perceptions of application features using data collected from users in the design and development departments across five firms. The results suggest that user perceptions of overall applications overshadow their perceptions of independent features, suggesting application-level lock-in effects and pointing out the difficulty in vendor attempts to unbundle features from feature categories and applications. The study closes with a discussion of the findings and offering cues for future research.		Michael J.

However, literature suggests the existence of potential gaps between the views of what these roles and skills should be and what they are, as perceived by ISPS and their clients. Ideally, ISPS should be agents of change with a balanced mix of business, behavioral and technical skills. However, literature characterzes 1S workers (as technical experts who lack the requisite “soil” and business skills they are supposed to have. These descriptions raise doubt as to whether ISPS actually measure up to the idealizedview of their rolesand skills which possibly explains why 1[S credibility k problematic in many organizations. Is there a gap in role behaviors,skills, or both? Do the gaps exist only in the eyes of clients, or do ISPS rdso jperceive the gaps? What phenomena explain the gaps, if they indeed exist? These are the questions addressed in this research-inprogress study. The study will utilize a case research strategy to gain an in-depth understanding of the nature and direction of the potential “role/skill gaps” and the processes influencing them. The investigation will be carried out at multiple levels of analyses. Beliefs and perceptions of ISPS and clients about what IS roleskkills should be and what they are will be examinecl at the individual level of analysis. The social-psychological processes that may cause or reinforce the gaps -selection I personnel recruitment, academic preparation, socialization, and social categorization--will be assessed at both individual and organizational levels of analysis. This work will shed new light on the current crisis of confidence in the Information Systems (IS) field, as evidenced, for example, by managements’ beliefs in the “productivity paradox”. It is very important for our field to determine the causes of dissatisfaction with the work of ISPS and ident.@ what can be done to improve the credibility of IS. Failure to recognize and reduce the gaps, if they indeed exist, may eventually spell danger to the IS profession, as clients re-engineer ISPS out of their jobs.	categorization;information system;job stream;socialization	Lara Preiser-Houy;Carole Agres;M.

This study aims to examine the satisfaction levels of mobile financial services users under different dimensions using SERVQUAL instrument. A self-administered questionnaire was used to survey in Dhaka with a sample of 201 respondents of various strata and data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics and ANOVA. The findings reveal that the overall satisfaction level of the users is somewhat satisfactory. The results also show that there are significant differences in satisfaction levels among the MFS user groups in terms of service providers' commitment, speed and sincerity and these differences are insignificant in terms of service users' income and convenience. The study suggests that the services need to be more customized and developed to improve the levels of satisfaction of the users.

However, the traditional expectation-disconfirmation theory (EDT), often employed to study satisfaction and continuance intentions has failed to recognize the role of CFTs. Accordingly, this study presents a conceptual model and empirically examines the moderating role of CFTs in the relationship between expectation disconfirmation and satisfaction, and the effect of CFTs on disappointment and IS continuance intentions. Results strongly support the hypothesized role of CFTs. This study contributes to a better conceptualization of the post-implementation user cognition and EDT, which has been traditionally used to examine user satisfaction and continuance intentions.	chicago engineering design team;cognition;conceptualization (information science);counterfactual conditional;event dispatching thread;pervasive informatics	Vidhya Mellarkod;Radha Appan;Glenn J.

c59f8729af12d3faae198d715752fe55e59fca6e	consumer acceptance of biometrics for identity verification in financial transactions	health;record;consumer;systems	Recently, there has been a growing trend towards consumer-based healthcare in which consumers are increasingly becoming partners in their own care. One way of accomplishing this is to provide consumers with access to their health records through the use of Personal Health Record (PHR) systems. In spite of their potential benefits, recent research has shown that PHRs are not yet popular or well known to consumers. The overall objective of this research is to investigate the influences of various personal, behavioral, and environmental factors on the adoption and use of PHR systems by Canadian consumers. Drawing on both the information systems and behavioral healthcare literatures such a model is developed and presented. The proposed model will be validated using a longitudinal design over a period of 16 months involving patients from two local clinics. The study participants will be introduced to an existing PHR system at those clinics. The system will subsequently be made available for their potential use. Users will be surveyed at various points in time regarding their perceptions about the system utilizing both close-ended and open-ended questions. Collected data will be analyzed using structure equation modeling and qualitative data analysis techniques.	biometrics;identity verification service;user interface	Michael Breward;Milena M.

Rogers’ diffusion of innovation model has been widely recognized as a powerful model for predicting technology adoption. This study adopted Rogers’ model to examine the adoption intentions of the three new types of computers. A telephone survey was conducted to collect data. This study made 1757 telephone calls, from which 1100 valid calls were obtained, representing a response rate of 62.61%. The data analysis demonstrates that the findings are generally congruent with the predictions of Rogers’ model. However, this study’s results also reveal one limitation of Rogers’ model, its pro-innovation bias, which explains why the diffusion of netbooks was incongruent with Rogers’ model.	classes of computers;netbook;smartphone;tablet computer	Shu-Chu Sarrina Li	2014	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2014.03.001	simulation;multimedia	HCI	-88.88211499412193	-9.03141689001092	173882

The assumption is that consumers choose to only use the superior alternative, yet, we often observe coexistence of old and new technologies. The contribution of this paper is to offer insights to the phenomenon of partial adoption: a little investigated and thus a quite new phenomenon within IS research. Our empirical findings suggest that positive attitude toward adoption, and intention to adopt, are not sufficient drivers of full adoption. Consumers do not generalize the positive experiences related to the partially adopted technology to all use situations. Rather, they think that the service provider should be active and instruct them how, when, and where to change their behavior. Thus, consumers expect the service providers to take the responsibility of the adoption.	coexist (image);device driver	Miira Juntumaa;Anssi Öörni	2011	2011 44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2011.340	service provider;the internet;interview;organization;knowledge management;marketing;management;law;information system;commerce	HCI	-85.2328061575125	-9.646219591642655	174128

However, gathering also the user-related success factors, that explain the reasons why users choose, download, and install apps as well as the user-related failure factors that explain the reasons why users delete apps, might help practitioners understand how to improve the market impact of their apps. The objectives were to: identify (i) the reasons why users choose and installing mobile apps from app stores; (ii) the reasons why users uninstall the apps.

67129c51017b77a30b710e6419ee148287c8c7fc	a study on the connotation, measuring dimensions and influence factors of sense of circle in mobile social networks	mobile social networks;sense of circle;measuring dimensions;influence factors	The cultural psychology of Chinese differential pattern has produced the circle phenomenon, and the objective existence of the circle is also eroding all aspects of our life. Sense of circle is the subjective cognition of circle, guiding the expression and coordination of interpersonal relationships. With the rapid development of mobile social networks, the research of network circles has become a hot topic nowadays. This paper explores the structural connotation, measuring dimensions and influence factors of sense of circle by qualitative research and empirical test method. Results from this study shows that the connotation of sense of circle consists of four dimensions: shared beliefs, reciprocal exchange, role orientation, social structure and twelve component factors, Among them, shared beliefs consists of emotional attribution, common values, demand fulfillment. Reciprocal exchange consists of sense of resources, thinking orientation, interactive acquisition. Role orientation consists of responsible consciousness, learning consciousness, volunteering consciousness. Social structure consists of stratum categories, implicit norms, and tie strength. And these 4 dimensions has different significance level, especially the finding of role orientation improving and developing existing circle theory in social network. These conclusions make up the deficiency of the existing research, and have guiding influence on enterprises’ innovation and strategy. & Sung Won Lee swlee@stepi.re.kr Hong Jin jinhong0238@hanmail.net Fan Zhang 1468575662@qq.com Jeong Eun So sso4387@cbnu.ac.kr 1 School of Business, Jiangxi Normal University, Jiangxi Province, China 2 Department of MIS, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju-si, Chungbuk, South Korea 3 Science and Technology Policy Institute, Sejong-si, South Korea 123 Wireless Pers Commun DOI 10.1007/s11277-017-4120-8	angular defect;cognition;consciousness;mobile social network;social structure;the circle (file system)	Hong Jin;Fan Zhang;Jeong Eun So;Sung Won Lee	2018	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-017-4120-8	empirical research;real-time computing;social psychology;computer science;learning circle;interpersonal relationship;connotation;social network;cultural psychology;cognition;phenomenon	AI	-86.40739510468201	-2.8687205320917046	175372

Before being adopted, all innovations face various types of resistance that may paralyse customers' desire to adopt an innovation. Following Ram and Sheth (1989), resistance was measured with five barriers, namely, usage barrier, value barrier, risk barrier, tradition barrier and image barrier. An internet questionnaire was developed and 1,540 responses from the non-users of mobile banking were collected. The results of the cluster analysis showed that different bank customers do indeed have different reasons for resisting mobile banking. The study provides academics and bank managers with an enhanced understanding of the different reasons inhibiting mobile banking adoption and the consumer demographics that determine such resistance.	mobile banking	Tommi Laukkanen;Suvi Sinkkonen;Pekka Laukkanen;Marke Kivijarvi	2008	IJMC	10.1504/IJMC.2008.017513	innovation;questionnaire;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;marketing;cluster analysis;retail banking;resistance;segmentation;computer security	Mobile	-90.9101062718449	-8.595529309883357	175525

In this paper, the authors analyze the current state of e-marketing in Jordanian travel agencies by examining the implantation of critical success factors of e-marketing. The research model analyzes the relationship between critical success factors and online direct marketing. Explanatory studies were used by distributing a qualified questionnaire to the employees of seventeen important travel agencies in Jordan to get results and test the research model. The paper concludes that a need exists to consolidate and strengthen the integration of the critical success factors of e-direct marketing in Jordanian travel agencies. Travel agencies must use a new business model and find a new way to contact their customers so to increase customer loyalty. Further research on the field of e-direct marketing and in travel agencies is needed. E-direct marketing can increase revenue for travel agencies in Jordan.

Specific benefits of e-marketing include: global reach, lower cost, tractable, measurable results, and 24-hour marketing (Nory, Jones, & Kochtanek, 2002). E-commerce and online marketing play a great role in the travel sector in Jordan and worldwide. Turban (2008) argued that travel agency services would be replaced by the rise of travel superstores on the internet. The economist predicted that the critical success factors are a popular approach that can be used to help companies identify the information system they need to improve and flush organizations. In this case, travel agencies will be gaining an advantage through the critical success factors. Turban (2008) identifies the critical success factors of direct online marketing as: new business model, interesting site, switching cost, and customer relations. This research paper adapts these factors to build a model on direct online marketing in Jordanian travel agencies. The paper also describes and illustrates the importance of critical success factors, and how they are required for the success of direct e-marketing.

fa707a2d1a959410c478048c7ca4ec6a53993a66	investigating mobile messaging in healthcare organizations: a sensemaking perspective		Hospitals are adopting advanced messaging systems to facilitate communication among healthcare personnel with the aim of improving patient care. However, users face various challenges in employing these systems, with serious consequences of miscommunication. Nevertheless, past studies on healthcare messaging systems tend to be descriptive with a lack of theoretically grounded and empirical validated research to explain their nature of use. Motivated thus, we study the usage patterns of a web-based messaging system (WMS) in the context of a public hospital. Using media synchronicity and sensemaking theories, we explain how healthcare personnel on the move use WMS to make sense of their work for achieving a shared understanding for patient care. Through a preliminary content analysis of the WMS messages during a month, our results showed salient differences in the usage patterns of different user groups and for different kinds of sensemaking. The studyu0027s potential contributions and future plan are discussed.	sensemaking	Zhenbin Yang;Atreyi Kankanhalli;Boon-Yuen Ng;Kee Kiat Koo	2013			public hospital;knowledge management;marketing;sensemaking;synchronicity;content analysis;health care;computer science	Vision	-84.71609770511522	-3.5762165355667643	178734

Given these interesting communication trends, we develop a structural model to understand mobile users’ behavior in the individual level consumption of voice and SMS services, allowing for cross-service dependencies. The key issues are the own-price elasticity and the cross-price elasticities of these services. The cross-price elasticity is of significant importance because the marketing activities are critically influenced by whether the goods are substitutes or complements. The research context also poses interesting econometric challenges (One-way and ‘Step’ Nonlinear pricing and Discrete (bundle choice)/continuous quantity model). Using a detailed individual level consumption data, we estimate that there is small substitution effect between voice service and SMS services. We also find that own price elasticity for voice services is relatively small. Younger users are far more inelastic than the older group in four kind of elasticity (ownand cross vs. voice and SMS). This is somewhat counter intuitive and gives some unique insight in understanding mobile service.	bivariate data;elasticity (data store);email;expectation–maximization algorithm;icis;image scaling;information systems;interdependence;landline;marginal model;observable;time complexity	Youngsoo Kim;William B.

However, most of the relevant research on electronic research quality is preoccupied with the website Internet context and most of the studies are single-country studies, inhibiting conclusions of generalizibility. Theoretically rooted in the Nordic Model of perceived service quality, this exploratory study uses an e-service quality scale to measure mobile Internet service quality in different national settings. Consistent with the available e-service quality literature, results indicate that e-service quality is a second-order factor, with three reflective first-order dimensions: efficiency, outcome, and customer care. Most important, cross-validation investigations using samples drawn from Korean, Hong Kong, and Japanese mobile Internet user populations, support the factorial structure invariance of the construct.

The advancement of mobile devices and their usage have increased the uptake of financial technology (FinTech) innovation. Financial sectors and startups see FinTech as a gateway to increase business opportunities, but mobile applications and other technology platforms must be launched to explore such opportunities. Mobile application security threats have increased tremendously and have become a challenge for both users and FinTech innovators. In this paper, the authors empirically inspect the components that influence the expectations of both users and organizations to adopt FinTech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, user interface design and FinTech promotion. The empirical results definitely confirm that data security, customer trust and the user design interface affect the adoption of FinTech. Existing studies have used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to address this issue. The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity.rnrnrnrnrnDesign/methodology/approachrnrnrnrnrnIn this paper, the authors empirically consider factors that influence the expectations of both users and organizations in adopting FinTech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, the user design interface and FinTech promotion.

This research proposes a model called “Intention to adopt FinTech in Germany,” constructs of which were developed based on the TAM and five additional components, as identified. The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnThe authors demonstrated that the number of mobile users in Germany is rapidly increasing; yet the adoption of FinTech is extremely sluggish. It is intriguing to reckon that 99 per cent of respondents had mobile devices, but only 10 per cent recognized FinTech. Further, it is significantly discouraging to perceive that only 10 of the 209 respondents had ever used FinTech services, representing under 1 per cent of the surveyed respondents. It is obvious that the FinTech incubators and banks offering FinTech services need to persuade their customers regarding the usefulness and value added advantages of FinTech. This study has been carried out to determine the key factors that influence and provoke FinTech adoption.rnrnrnrnrnResearch limitations/implicationsrnrnrnrnrnThere are a few limitations in this study. Initially, this study focuses on FinTech implementation in Germany and not the whole of Europe. In addition, demographic and regional factors could be consolidated to inspect their particular impact on the intention to use FinTech services, particularly among younger users with a high interest in technology. Without these constraints, the authors could have gathered additional data for a more robust result and obtained new knowledge to further upgrade polices to enhance the FinTech adoption process. Future analysts can assist exploration of this topic by altering determinants in the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model. Additionally, because the cluster sampling technique was used, the reported outcomes are not 100 per cent generalized to the German population. To accomplish a complete generalization, a basic random sampling strategy for the whole population is essential. The authors could also alleviate some limitations by examining how online vendors are performing with regard to FinTech to satisfy the needs of customers via case studies.rnrnrnrnrnPractical implicationsrnrnrnrnrnThis study was conducted in Germany and might have produced different results if held in other countries, as technology acceptance is different in a different environment. For instance, the authors suspect that the results would be somewhat different, were the research to be conducted in the United Kingdom, where take-up of FinTech appears to be far greater than in Germany. Therefore, the authors’ results are only generalized for the country of Germany and not other geographical areas. Furthermore, respondents may have been influenced by past experiences about FinTech usage which might have led them to neglect to answer some questions. In spite of this, this study did not consider the influence of moderating variables such as age, education and FinTech services experience. The authors also neglected social impact and control factors, as their corresponding items disregarded the instrument dependability. Accordingly, the authors could not quantify social impact and control factors on FinTech use.rnrnrnrnrnSocial implicationsrnrnrnrnrnThe outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to accomplish economies of scale for global intensity. The authors do hope that this paper will serve to encourage FinTech innovators in their approach to FinTech and enable FinTech researchers to use past work with more prominent certainty, resulting in rigid hypothesis improvement in the future.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnA considerable amount of revenue has been invested in the information technology (IT) infrastructure of banks to enhance their performance, but investment in IT remains a substantial risk regarding the return on investment (Carlson, 2015). Most banks and financial organizations around the globe are engaging in an extreme pressure from their customers and competitors to enhance IT.	data security	Harrison Stewart;Jan Jürjens	2018	Inf. & Comput.

To fill up the existing knowledge gap in this area, this paper examines factors influencing behavioral intention and attitude toward government websites usage among citizens in Taiwan. Drawing on widely employed intention-based models and on the literature on trustworthiness factors, this paper develops an integrated framework and proposes influences positively related to the adoption intention. We examined this framework using survey data from 200 citizens with prior usage experience in Taiwan. The results show that trust of government, facilitating conditions, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use have significant positive effects on usage intention to e-government. The results can help the policy makers identify the factors significant for encouraging adoption of e-government services and strategic revision.	e-government;emergence;itil;imperative programming;internet;noise shaping;trust (emotion);usability	Hui-Ju Wang;Jin Lo	2010		10.1145/1967486.1967567	public relations;knowledge management;marketing;business	HCI	-87.79447654426016	-8.992954701258528	184394

Then a questionnaire on trust evaluation of mobile commerce is designed, and reliability analysis and validity analysis on the trust evaluation scale are conducted respectively. Based on SEM, first-order confirmatory factor analysis is used to test the established trust evaluation model for mobile commerce, and second-order factor analysis is applied to determine the weights of trust influence factors. An indicator system for evaluating the trustworthiness of mobile vendors is proposed. The openness for the transaction-related data of four main mobile commerce platforms is analyzed. An ELECTREIII-based algorithm for evaluating the trustworthiness of mobile-vendors is designed. Empirical analysis shows that the proposed trust model and trustworthiness evaluation algorithm can be rationally and meaningfully used to make mobile vendors recommendation by third party trust service provider.	algorithm;confirmatory factor analysis;e-commerce;first-order predicate;mobile commerce;openness;trust (emotion);trust service provider	Chunhui Piao;Shuzhen Wang;Jie Wen;Yongchun Luo	2012	2012 IEEE 14th International Conference on Commerce and Enterprise Computing	10.1109/CEC.2012.27	mobile commerce;trust anchor;computer science;internet privacy;mobile computing;computer security;statistics	SE	-89.73630144428	-9.699295452039584	184909
21e4a93dcdc59a6b5bf1e9eb2e6a763b86304ccf	a typology of user liability to it addiction	liability;it addiction;user profile;typology;smartphone	To date, information systems (IS) research mainly has provided a monolithic view of information technology (IT) use, considering it to be a desired behaviour with positive outcomes. However, given the dramatic increase in the use of technology during the last few years, susceptibility to ITaddiction is increasingly becoming an important issue for technology users and IS researchers. In this paper, we report the results of a study that focuses on identifying variations in user liability to ITaddiction, which reflects the susceptibility of individual users to develop IT addiction. First, a review of the literature in different disciplines (e.g. health, psychology and IS) allows us to better understand the concepts of IT addiction and liability to addiction. The literature review also provides an overview of the antecedents and consequences associated with IT addiction. Then, building on the analysis of 15 in-depth interviews and 182 exploratory open-ended surveys collected from smartphone users, we apply the concept of liability to addiction in the IT use context and propose a typological theory of user liability to IT addiction. Our typology reveals five ideal types; each can be associated to a user profile (ADDICT, FANATIC, HIGHLY ENGAGED, REGULAR AND THOUGHTFUL). Building upon both the extant literature and our results, we put forth propositions to extend the theoretical contributions of the study. We finally discuss the contributions and implications of our paper for research and practice.	biological anthropology;information system;nonlinear gameplay;smartphone;user profile	Isaac Vaghefi;Liette Lapointe;Camille Boudreau-Pinsonneault	2017	Inf.

While empirical research states that the usefulness of a methodology is the single most important determinant of its acceptance and use by actual users, studies have not examined which aspects of usefulness are more important for which type of people in which situations. Our study is a step toward filling the gap in methodology evaluation, development, and adoption literature, which to date has not developed a theoretically and practically complete as well as relevant typology of the usefulness of a methodology and has also not studied the effect of personal traits such as needs. Based on needs and expectancy theories, we develop a conceptual model that holds that individual needs and contextual factors such as gender and age determine which aspect of the usefulness of a methodology has a bigger effect on individuals’ intentions to actually use the methodology.	biological anthropology;categorization;emoticon;information systems;interaction;point of view (computer hardware company);theory;utility	Kunal Mohan;Frederik Ahlemann	2010				HCI	-86.76419440390674	-8.028613642338264	187225

Recent studies have shown that the two factors Expertise and the Motivation to process information have a significant influence on the preference of configurators. In this paper we consider the influence of those two factors on the fit of two types of configuration systems: Parameter-based and Needs-based configurators. While a Parameter-based system allows users to specify design parameters, a Needs-based configurator calculates those parameters based on the users weighted needs. To test the fit of each configurator depending on the Expertise and the Motivation of users, we carried out an experiment. Therefore, we developed a prototype for both types of configuration systems. We found out that Parameter-based systems are more appropriate for customers with high Expertise and high Motivation to process information. Contrary, for customers with low Expertise and Motivation companies are better advised to use Needs-based configurators.	configuration management;fits;prototype	Markus Weinmann;Martin Hibbeln;Susanne Robra-Bissantz	2011			economics;marketing;personalization;configuration design	HCI	-90.31112749604301	-5.1249947132105245	188211
3d7c24be9e4316f77c8f94b6d80b770bd35abf98	relationships among knowledge management, organisational innovativeness and performance: covariance-based versus partial least-squares structural equation modelling		The relationships among e®ective knowledge management (KM), organisational innovativeness (OI), market orientation (MO) and organisational performance (OP) have been explored in the literature. These constructs are generally analysed in pairs, such as the in°uence of KM on OI, or KM on OP, and other combinations, but the relationships among the full set of constructs in question are not fully understood yet. In the extant literature, the relationships among them are analysed for the most part with covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM). Partial least-squares (PLS) path modelling is a component-based approach to SEM that is not as widely used as CB-SEM, but it has the potential to allow increased °exibility in handling various modelling problems in comparison with CB models, particularly for predictive and exploratory purposes. This paper aims to verify whether the PLS method could con ̄rm or reject the results of the more restrictive covariance-based method in modelling the relationships among KM, OI, MO and OP. The results indicate that both methods yielded convergent and discriminant validity for the constructs, displaying stability across model analysis and depuration. The PLS model revealed the in°uence of KM on MO, OI and OP. It also shows that OI is the main driving factor for OP. KM seems to have a direct e®ect on OP, which is greatly magni ̄ed when mediated by OI. The sample size, although borderline adequate for the CB method, was more than adequate for PLS, yielding excellent model stability.	component-based software engineering;discriminant;knowledge management;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;partial least squares regression;structural equation modeling	José Roberto Frega;Alex Antonio Ferraresi;Carlos O.

This study explored consumer acceptance after the implementation of online games through mobile phones, based on the 'Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology' (UTAUT) model, while considering the moderating effects of the online gaming experience and experience of web browsing on mobile phones. The research results indicate that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions are all significant determinants of attitudes toward playing online games through mobiles and following the attitude positively influences behavioural intention. This research also reveals that the experience of playing online games and the experience of web browsing on mobile phones have a moderating effect on the acceptance of playing online games through mobile phones. Finally, management implications and future research are also presented in this research.	mobile phone	Lily Shui-Lien Chen;Chi Jung Kuan	2012	IJMC	10.1504/IJMC.2012.049758	simulation;mobile telephony;computer science;web navigation;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-88.57854531647999	-9.860420271304418	190027

The model of e-Government acceptance in public sector integrates constructs from TAM, the extended TAM (TAM2), the diffusion of innovation (DOI), and trust literature. To empirically test the model, the data were collected from 112 public officers in 10 ministries in Cambodia. The finding shows that image and output quality are significant influential determinants toward perceived usefulness. Perceived usefulness, relative advantage, and trust are significant determinants toward the acceptance of e-Government usage in public sector.	computer simulation;e-government;ibm tivoli access manager	Sinawong Sang;Jeong-Dong Lee;Jongsu Lee	2009			computer science;empirical research;angular velocity;data mining;rotation;e-government;reciprocating motion;crank;public sector;groove (music);mechanical engineering	HCI	-89.89419011326756	-5.874740274079699	190223

The necessary data can be generated through attaching identifiers to items and deploying suitable readers all over the supply chain that capture the information on the identifiers. Organizations only have access to data about item movements within their organizational boundaries. Therefore sharing of data between organizations is required to gain full visibility. However, the willingness of organizations to share data is considered to be low. In this paper we present the results of a study that aimed at investigating the actual willingness of companies to share item-level data and at exploring the perceived privacy risks that may restrain companies from sharing item-level data. From the findings, requirements for the design of inter-organizational data sharing infrastructures are derived.	privacy;security through obscurity	Markus Eurich;Nina Oertel;Roman Boutellier	2010	Electronic Commerce Research	10.1007/s10660-010-9062-0	computer science;marketing;supply chain;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;internet of things	DB	-85.92010070048168	-7.218861739417078	191304

It is affected by many internal and external factors. These factors might change overtime. Therefore trust value becomes dynamic and creates a big challenge. Although, many researchers studied the effect of different factors on consumers’ trust, the trust literature lacks clear differentiation among the factors contributing to trust and fails to capture its multidimensional nature. Thus, this research presents a holistic approach that study trust empirically in the context of B2C EC and attempts to determine the major factors that affect consumers’ trust. The research provides a valuable feedback for e-commerce web site designers and for e-vendors as well.	e-commerce;holism;web design	Radwan M. Al-Dwairi;Mumtaz A.

We study this question in the context of cloud infrastructure services. The provider offers two levels of support, basic and full. Under basic support, the provider handles simple service quality issues. Under full support, the provider also offers education, training, and personalized guidance through two-way interactions with buyers. Using unique data on public cloud infrastructure services use by 22,179 firms from March 2009 to August 2012, we find that buyers who receive full support use the service 34.85 percent more than other users. We further show that buyers who have full support deploy infrastructure services more efficiently, increasing the fraction of servers they run in parallel by 3.53 percentage points relative to those who do not. Furthermore, buyers who drop full support and switch back to basic support continue using 15.01 percent more of the service and have a proportion of servers running in parallel that is 2.82 percentage points higher compared to buyers who have never received full support. These findings provide suggestive evidence of buyer learning as a result of provider support.	cloud computing;scalability	German F. Retana;Chris Forman;Sridhar Narasimhan;Marius F. Niculescu;D. J.

EMR systems are expected to make benefits for healthcare providers, professionals and the health population as a whole. Actually, the EMR benefits cannot be achieved without the adoption of the system by users in the healthcare. There has been much research suggested that EMR has not been adopted as expected. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack in research which provides a comprehensive taxonomy of the factors affecting EMR user adoption. The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic literature review to extract factors impacting EMR user adoption and to clarify them into meaningful categories. We searched in nine scientific databases and 9684 papers found as initial screening. We excluded papers based on their title, abstract and full text and finally we had 89 relevant papers which focus on factors impacting EMR adoption. We extracted factors and identified 8 main categories: individual, psychological, behavioural, environmental, organizational, financial, legal, and technical. Our results have important implications for researchers and practitioners, including policy makers, marketers, information technology (IT) professionals, and EMR system developers.	database;excalibur: morgana's revenge;systematic review;taxonomy (general)	Mohammadreza Najaftorkaman;Amir Hossein Ghapanchi	2014			knowledge management;systematic review;health care;health informatics;population;information and communications technology;information technology;computer science;management information systems;emix	HCI	-87.08833942518694	-6.192406562433518	194997

Drawing on users’ different dispositional attribution of these trusting beliefs, we investigate the different influence of two sets of experiential reasons on the competence belief versus the benevolence and integrity beliefs in online recommendation agents (RAs). The two sets of experiential reasons encompass interactive reason, including three performance factors (namely, perceived cognitive effort, advice quality, and perceived strategy restrictiveness), and knowledge-based reason (i.e., perceived transparency of an RA). Data were collected through a laboratory experiment to test our hypotheses. Results demonstrate that the three performance factors affect only the competence belief, whereas perceived RA transparency influences all three trusting beliefs.

An extended technology acceptance model (TAM) is developed to test citizen engagement towards online e-government services from a sample of 307 citizens who used the benefits advisor tool within a Spanish City Hall. Although the proposed model follows TAM and explains the intention towards the actual use of e-government by postulating four direct determinants, “A, PU, PEOU and BI” have been considered as parallel processes, meaning that each can have separate influence in different levels of citizen engagement. To achieve this goal, a multinomial logistic regression is developed and tested to confirm the explanatory power of the four technology enablers on the four different levels of e-government. Our findings further suggest that in order to implement egovernment, some of the enablers matter more than others to move from one level of citizen engagement to another. The main contribution of the paper is to question the use of existing models which seek to represent the relationship between technology enablers and the adoption of e-government services without considering their impacts on citizens’ engagement.

A measurement instrument is developed to measure an end-user computing competency in this environment. Using an exploratory factor analysis of 348 respondents, four factor dimensions for the measurement of EUCC is first identified, and then structural equation modeling techniques are utilized to examine the relationship between EUCC and user performance. It is shown that the four factor dimensions of EUCC account for a significant portion of the variation in user performance.	end-user computing	Chui Young Yoon	2008	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2008.03.002	structural equation modeling;simulation;exploratory factor analysis;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;end-user computing;statistics	HPC	-90.04583740993066	-4.872078167980894	198849

While several existing methods such as conjoint analysis (CA), Kano model and quality function deployment support the translation of customer requirements into technical specifications, researchers are now working to develop methods aimed at integrating affective aspects into product design. Kansei engineering (KE) is a design philosophy that considers customer perceptions and emotions by adopting a multi-disciplinary approach. CA is a useful tool within a KE project. This article presents a methodology for conducting a KE project in early development phases. This methodology is based on two new procedures. The first one is aimed at calculating attribute importance weights by using respondent choice time in controlled interviews. The second procedure allows the exploitation of such weights in an ordinal logistic regression model for analysing the results of CA experiments. By using the proposed methodology, it is possible to identify product/service attributes able to induce specific emotions and feelings in customers and consequently choose the right development strategy. An application of the method for the design of mobile phones is presented.
