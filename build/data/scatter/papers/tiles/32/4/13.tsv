When this happens, interactants may only have limited information about their partners on which to make judgments. Avatars can provide important cues to a person's identity, such as likes, appearance, or personality. The present study tests whether the type of anticipated future interaction (i.e., online or face-to-face) moderates the avatar creation process. Findings from an experiment indicate that any expectation of future interaction impacts attractiveness and similarity ratings of an avatar in comparison to the self, while text- based avatar descriptions vary according to the modality of expected future interaction. Results are discussed as they apply to hyperpersonal model of computer-mediated communication [3].

However, this high activity rate has made it difficult for businesses to decide where to build their web presence in their e-commerce website or in SNSs. This paper explores the impact of social plugins integration into e-commerce website. An empirical study was undertaken to investigate the impact of social plugins on consumer's perceived trust, word-of-mouth (WOM) effect, and consumer's purchase intention. The result shows that there is positive impact on consumer purchase intention by integrating social plugins in e-commerce website. Recommendations for future research are outlined in this paper.	e-commerce;interactive media;interactivity;plug-in (computing);recommender system;web presence	Yoke Yie Chen;F. W.

One form of boundary maintenance is hazing, or subjecting potential group members to degrading initiation rituals. This article presents a case study of how one online community employs hazing techniques. Using both quantitative and qualitative computer-mediated discourse analysis, the study examines how the elite members of the community enact violence, withhold cultural capital, and control access as a means to retain their power and maintain their boundaries. The results of this study have implications for understanding boundary maintenance, hazing in online contexts, and online communities in general.	online community	Courtenay Honeycutt	2005	J.

We want to investigate such behavior for developers while they are learning and contributing on socially collaborative environments, specifically code hosting sites and question/answer sites. In this study, we investigate the following questions about advocates, developers who can be identified as well-rounded community contributors and active learners. Do advocates flock together in a community? How do flocks of advocates migrate within a community? Do these flocks of advocates migrate beyond a single community? To understand such behavior, we collected 12,578 common advocates across a code hosting site GitHub and a question/answering site Stack Overflow. These advocates were involved in 1,549 projects on GitHub and were actively asking 114,569 questions and responding 408,858 answers and 1,001,125 comments on Stack Overflow. We performed an in-depth empirical analysis using social networks to find the flocks of advocates and their migratory pattern on GitHub, Stack Overflow, and across both communities. We found that 7.5% of the advocates create flocks on GitHub and 8.7% on Stack Overflow. Further, these flocks of advocates migrate on an average of 5 times on GitHub and 2 times on Stack Overflow. In particular, advocates in flocks of two migrate more frequently than larger flocks. However, this migration behavior was only common within a single community. Our findings indicate that advocates’ flocking and migration behavior differs substantially from the ones found in other social environments. This suggests a need to investigate the factors that demotivate the flocking and migration behavior of advocates and ways to enhance and integrate support for such behavior in collaborative software tools.

bff4d2607d4580d21760e1ae7d64a16288f98b8e	perceived value of information sharing in online environments: user engagement and social reputation	consumer review;information sharing;helpfulness	Consumer reviews have received much attention both in academia and industry, since it has been found that they have significant effects on people’s decision-making behaviors relating to online shopping or choosing services. The readers/visitors on various online communities where such reviews are posted evaluate the helpfulness of a review based on the extent to which the review is helpful in their information seeking and decision-making tasks. However, it is often not clear what makes a review useful to a reader. Several previous works have analyzed textual features relating to reviews to determine their usefulness, but given that most of these reviews are generated and shared through community-based or social media sites, the features that incorporate social features and social engagement could have an important role to play in making a review useful. The work described in this paper uses data available from Yelp, a social review and recommendation site, to build models that examine the impact of various features, including basic, reviewer’s engagement, social reputation, and business type, based on the number of votes for helpfulness a review receives. Our findings suggest that reviewer’s social contextual information (engagement and reputation) is influential in affecting perceived helpfulness of a review and improves the accuracy of prediction model. The findings also suggest that business type (restaurants vs. transportations) affects the ways in which consumers consider a review.	bricx command center;customer to customer;ibm notes;information seeking;online community;online shopping;product type;purchasing;social media;systems design	Dongho Choi;Chirag Shah	2014		10.1002/meet.2014.14505101052	world wide web	HCI	-88.56152586564727	-13.034557642498015	168432

Since receiving phishing e-mails is an important prerequisite of victimization, this study focusses on becoming a phishing target. More precisely, we use an integrative lifestyle exposure model to study the effects of risky online routine activities that make a target more likely to come across a motivated offender. Insights of the lifestyle exposure model are combined with propensity theories in order to determine which role impulsivity plays in phishing targeting. To achieve these objectives, data collected in 2016 from a representative sample ( n  = 723) were used. Support was found for a relationship between both online purchasing behavior and digital copying behavior, and phishing targeting. Moreover, a relationship was found between all online activities (except for online purchasing behavior) and impulsivity. The present study thus suggests that especially online shoppers and users who often share and use copied files online should be trained to deal with phishing attacks appropriately.

5b1d88802dbecd4909a23fca26cdafb56c61f089	the interpersonal privacy identity (ipi): development of a privacy as control model		The Internet and social computing technology have revolutionized our ability to gather information as well as enabled new modes of communication and forms of self-expression. As the popularity of social computing technologies has increased, our society has begun to witness modifications in socialization behaviors. Social psychology theory suggests that technological changes can influence an individual’s expectation of privacy, through adaptive behaviors resulting from use (Laufer and Wolfe in J Soc Issues 33(3): 22–42 (1977)). We adapt traditional privacy theory to explore the influence of developmental and environmental factors on the individual’s inner privacy identity, which is comprised of the individual’s belief in his or her right to control (1) personal information and (2) interactions with others, and is continuously shaped by privacy experiences. We then use the inner privacy identity to examine interpersonal behaviors in the online context. We find that individuals’ belief in their right to control their information impacts their information disclosure practices when consequences are implied and that their belief in their right to control the interaction impacts their online information sharing practices. We do not find support for a relationship between the interaction management component of the IPI and online interaction behavior, which considered in the presence of the relationship between interaction management and online information sharing, suggests that interaction behavior is more complicated in the online context. Insights from the model developed in this study can inform future studies of situational privacy behaviors.	futures studies;interaction;internet;personally identifiable information;privacy;social computing;socialization	Tabitha L.

The effectiveness of mobile coupon is context dependent which involves reaching customers with the right promotion strategies that differs in time-limited scarcity messages and quantity-limited scarcity messages. However, the joint effects of mobile coupon promotions under different time pressure, quantity limitation and discount strategies on consumers’ purchase intention have been unexplored in the literature. Drawing from the value-risk paradigm, we develop a new research model to examine consumers’ responses to mobile coupon with different time-limited scarcity messages and quantity-limited scarcity messages across different promotion strategies. An experiment is designed to test the research model. The findings of this study will have implications for future research and marketing practice. Specifically, Information Systems (IS) and marketing personnel will gain a fresh insight on how mobile couponing with different time-limited scarcity messages, quantity-limited scarcity messages and discount strategies can be effective for consumer purchase.

This study explored factors that affect consumer acceptance of e-book use by applying a model that incorporates the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the theoretical basis of the hypotheses. The model differentiated external factors-compatibility, relative advantage, self-efficacy, and subjective norms-from internal factors-perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, satisfaction with e-book usage, and intention to continue using e-books. The study (n=1030) found statistically significant support for the hypothesized model, indicating that the tested relationships between the revised TAM and user intention to continue using e-books were positive and statistically significant. The study's findings provide potentially significant implications that can be used to develop guidelines and a framework for assessing e-book users' behavior.	e-book;ibm tivoli access manager	Chang-Hyun Jin	2014	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2014.09.056	social psychology	HCI	-89.63058131954432	-10.350045231884495	169547
ad5d704099bcae16fabd40e72f1a92c5c6876264	continued intention to use online participatory budgeting: the effect of empowerment and habit		Online participatory budget, an e-participation platform to engage citizens in decision-making processes, has become more popular in the last decade in several cities across Europe. Nevertheless, to assure its continuity of use and keep the citizens' engagement over time remains a challenge year by year for the local governments. This paper explores the effect of empowerment and habit on the continued intention to use online participatory budget considering the individual differences by age and gender. We develop a research model that is evaluated using structural equation modelling based on the responses of 370 citizens that experienced the online participatory budget in the city of Lisbon, which was the first capital in Europe to implement the online platform in 2008. Results suggest that competence, meaning, and habit positively influence the continued intention to use online participatory budgeting, and that meaning has a stronger effect on older men than younger women. The paper discusses the implications for local governments.	participatory ergonomics;scott continuity;structural equation modeling	Mijail Naranjo Zolotov;Tiago Oliveira;Sven Casteleyn	2018		10.1145/3209415.3209461	participatory budgeting;computer science;public relations;e-participation;habit;citizen journalism;empowerment	HCI	-85.61938548072213	-10.136338717261	169713

This study suggests that human values is a determinant of innovativeness toward adopting online services. A questionnaire was administered to 300 undergraduate and postgraduate students in a large public university in Hong Kong. Empirical results showed that individuals with achievement, self-direction and stimulation values were relatively more innovative in adopting online services than others in the social system. On the contrary, people who attach more importance to conformity, security and tradition values were relatively less innovative in adopting online services than others in the social system.	branch predictor;conformity;e-services;online service provider;social system;value (ethics)	Renee H.

217d0746ea85f09e83d340bf0f170ec508bafc1f	factors for customer information satisfaction: user approved and empirically evaluated		ABSTRACTOverall customer satisfaction with websites has been linked with many positive customer behaviors and attitudes. In the highly competitive e-markets, website designers are consistently searching for new ways to gain an edge. Customer information satisfaction (CIS) studies have demonstrated the positive impact that information content has on customer’s overall satisfaction. Additionally, content preparation (CP) studies have focused on developing models and content factor structures to illustrate customer information needs. Reviewing the literature, there is a lack of research in these areas that focus on U.S. Internet users and online customers. In addition, guidelines and tools are needed to support designers. Thus, the objectives of this study are to (1) empirically evaluate a theoretical CP model; (2) derive a content factor structure; and (3) interpret results as design guidelines for online CIS.

8884b4b6a4c6b89978399b88fd4f6ceb5b6e47da	perceptions of justice or injustice as determinants of contributor defections from online communities	virtual communities	Much of the recent research on user contributions to electronic networks has focused on attracting and motivating participations. We, instead, investigate online community defections,1 their cause, and their impact through an empirical investigation of defections from Wikipedia. Our research uses justice theory to determine the effects of injustice perceptions on contributor defections and draws on fairness heuristic theory to distinguish the relative effects of distributive injustice and procedural injustice. The results show that perceptions of injustice concerning collaboration outcomes (“distributive injustice”) raise contributor dissatisfaction, which in turn leads to defection. Perceptions of injustice concerning the process (“procedural injustice”), by comparison, have a direct impact on defections and exert a stronger influence on dissatisfaction than distributive injustice. Justice emerges as a hygiene factor adding to the level of dissatisfaction among dissatisfied contributors but not among satisfied contributors. The findings contribute to our understanding of collaborative knowledge creation by drawing attention to contributors' post hoc passive emotions and behaviors instead of predominantly investigating their initial prosharing behaviors. The work also has practical implications for community governance because it suggests how to sustain communities in the long term.	online community	Ling Jiang;Christian Wagner	2015	JASIST	10.1002/asi.23261	computer science	ECom	-87.09081672763305	-16.808677125211453	170704

However, the type of information that effectively recommends a product is not clearly understood. To allow consumers to select an optimal product, it is necessary to understand the human purchasing model and discover an interface design that can effectively present information. It has been predicted that pages that include negative eWOM facilitate trust toward the system, although cognitive resources are required to process the information. The results of a controlled experiment show that participants who encountered negative eWOM and have less cognitive load could developed higher trust toward the product and were motivated to purchase it. This study implies that cognitive factors such as access to negative eWOM are important for developing trust and motivating product buying behavior. It contributes to determining when negative eWOM can be effective and provides new knowledge about developing consumer buying models on the web.	association rule learning;purchasing;recommender system;social media marketing	Yugo Hayashi;Ryo Orita;Sayuri Kajiwara	2017		10.1145/3022198.3026321	computer science;interface design;multimedia;social psychology;world wide web;recommender system	HCI	-90.03523716420982	-13.846476516637887	171268

In this paper, an online trust model is presented that exhibits the impact of four external factors (personal innovativeness, propensity to trust, familiarity, and presence of third-party seals) on the intention to use an online payment via the mediation of three endogenous variables (enjoyment, risk, and customer trust). The data was collected from Kuwait, an Arab country, with a mixed of data collection survey methods of 150 online questionnaires and 200 paper-based questionnaires. The data was then analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) regression. The findings revealed that customer trust and enjoyment are two important drivers of the online payment adoption, which neutralized risk perceptions. This study discusses these results as well as research and a managerial perspectives that could assist in enhancing online payment acceptance in Kuwait.	e-commerce payment system;it risk;partial least squares regression;ws-trust	Kamel Rouibah;Paul Benjamin Lowry;Yujong Hwang	2016	Electronic Commerce Research and Applications	10.1016/j.elerap.2016.07.001	public relations;marketing;risk;advertising	HCI	-89.25408357378262	-11.663361969831534	172243

ATTITUDE TOWARDS ONLINE SHOPPING Despite an increasing number of online shoppers and offering of wide range of products on Internet, one finds paucity of research work undertaken with a focus on demographic variables especially gender as well as the attitudes; perceptions and profiling of online shoppers worldwide and especially in India. An attempt has been made by the researcher to throw light on attitudes of online shoppers reflected through their online shopping activities as follows. Anne (2007)1 focused on the appearance of new kinds of risk and new risk-relievers in electronic buying situations. A qualitative study was conducted in order to identify risk dimensions and risk relievers. The links between risk and risk-relievers were taken into account. A quantitative survey was conducted to measure perceived risk level and risk-reliever utility, and to present a cluster analysis of consumer risk reduction behaviour based on risk-reliever utility scores. Author identified different type of risks such as the risks of Security; Confidentiality and Credibility which were perceived as the strongest risks. The results of the study suggested that online retailers should build web sites that are not only useful, secure, and respect privacy, but it should be trustworthy to reduce risk associated with buying of product or service. Higher Perceptions of privacy and security were found as highly associated with a promise of safeguards for personal information (Anne-Sophie Cases, 2007). Shwu (2003), examined relationships between Internet users’ concerns and perceptions of online shopping. The attitude of Internet users toward online shopping was measured using the relationship between the attitudes and its attitude and influence factors showed that Fishbin Model could effectively measure consumer characteristics. Author analyzed the factors affecting the online consumer’s behavior and examined how e-marketers can influence the outcome of the virtual interaction and buying process by focusing their marketing efforts on elements shaping the customer’s virtual experience (Shwu, 2003). Chanaka (2004) studied on a ValueAttitude-Behaviour Model to investigate the role of personal values in online shopping consumer behaviour. Structural Equation Modelling identified that personal values such as self-direction, enjoyment, and self-achievement were significantly related to positive attitudes towards online shopping. Individual attitudes toward online shopping were direct predicator of buying behaviour, and mediated the relationship between personal values and behaviour of online shoppers. This hierarchical relationship among personal values, attitudes and behaviour need to exploited by e-tailors to position e-shops that provides a persuasive means to e-shoppers to better satisfy needs of online shoppers(Jayawardhena, 2004). Glenn.J. Browne and others (2004) undertook study to develop insight into problems concerning online shopping by assessing online shoppers’ beliefs and preferences from physical stores. Internet business problems included the need to structure internal and external business processes to serve customers appropriately for online shopping.

c4dc0601302532bf296fc4afcb624a2fe7432ca9	user's adoption of mobile o2o applications: perspectives of the uses and gratifications paradigm and service dominant logic		The rapid adoption of smart phones and mobile Internet usage is now changing the way consumers shop. With the emerging application of SOLOMO (social, location, mobile) concept, O2O (online to offline) application has become the unique and major attribute for mobile commerce. Consumers can use O2O application not only for pure consuming purpose, but they can act as opinion providers, idea creators or the roles of marketing and sales representatives for online retailers as well. Though the above important and unique O2O application features can be well-recognized from the many practical retailing evidences, academic attention paid to understand the impacts of seamless and mobile O2O features on the formation of the degree of perceived customer participation, relationship quality toward O2O application and subsequent behavioural outcomes is still relatively sparse. In order to address the above research gaps, the objectives of this study are to investigate the effects of the unique attributes of O2O smart phone application on customer participation, relationship quality and subsequent behavioural outcomes through the lens of the uses and gratifications (U&G) and servicedominant logic. The research context of our study focused on the O2O application platform or hub combining internal and external resources from both a single supply chain and a set of supply and demand networks, such as the O2O app of Starbucks coffee, Mos Burger, or AccuPas, an integrated platform for external companies and it allows these external companies to create any marketing or sales activities across pre-purchase, purchase and post-purchase stages. The online survey yielded a total of 196 completed questionnaires. Results confirmed that user participation and relationship quality are two significant determinants to facilitate user’s behavioural loyalty toward the usage of O2O application and impulse buying intention. Besides, we also confirmed that user’s O2O application adoption motivation is a second-order composite assessment, in terms of information, convenience, entertainment and social interaction, and such motivation has positive effect both on user participation and relationship quality. Theoretical and practical implications were also addressed in this study.	internet;mobile app;mobile commerce;online and offline;online shopping;paradigm;seamless3d;smartphone;sparse matrix;usb hub	Chun-Der Chen;Cheng-Kui Huang;Mei-Ju Chen;Edward C.

In this research, we analyze the impact of phishing alerts released in public databases on the market value of global firms. Using a sample of 1942 phishing alerts related to 259 firms in 32 countries, we show that the release of each phishing alert leads to a statistically significant loss of market capitalization that is at least US$ 411million for a firm. We propose a theoretical framework for analyzing the impact of threats on firm value, and determine that the negative investor reaction is strongly significant for alerts released in 2006-2007 and for those targeted to financial holding companies, and weakly significant for firms listed in the US. We derive and validate these results using a combination of event study, subsampling analysis, and cross-sectional regression analysis. Our research makes a contribution by providing a new model for conducting multi-country event studies. We also contribute to the information systems literature by quantifying the loss in market value caused by phishing, and provide compelling evidence to information security administrators of firms that urge them to adopt adequate countermeasures to prevent phishing attacks. We study the impact of release of phishing alerts on firm value.We use a novel asset pricing model for conducting an event study.Phishing alerts negatively impact firm value for global companies.Financial holding companies are strongly affected by release of such alerts.	phishing	Indranil Bose;Alvin Chung Man Leung	2014	Decision Support Systems	10.1016/j.dss.2014.04.006	public relations;event study;phishing;computer science;marketing;world wide web;computer security;enterprise value;commerce	Metrics	-85.25990132581573	-12.440841673328423	174238

It has reduced search costs, opened up barriers to entry, and diminished distinctiveness of firms. Effective retention of customers allows firms to grow in size and popularity, thereby increasing their profitability. We extended Commitment–Trust theory, an expectation–confirmation model, and technology acceptance theory to develop a model of IS continuance intention of customers of web-based applications. Relationship commitment and trust were found to be central to IS continuance intention. Also, perceived empowerment influenced relationship commitment, while perceived security influenced trust. Our findings thus supported traditional intention factors, highlighting the role of trust as a stronger predictor of intention than commitment but, contradicting findings from marketing research, trust was found to be a stronger predictor of retention in the e-commerce context. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we seek to determine what factors will influence bloggers' intent to use SMRs or their components. Our global survey of 332 bloggers finds that bloggers' perceptions of the effectiveness of the SMR and the use of SMRs by companies positively affect their decisions to use SMRs now and in the future. We also find that bloggers' current use of SMRs influences their decisions to continue using SMRs. Implications on the use of SMRs as corporate communication tools are discussed.	blog;shingled magnetic recording;social media	Leyland F. Pitt;Michael Parent;Peter G. Steyn;Pierre R.

It also examined the impact of self-monitoring and social support on these connections. We used questionnaires to survey 314 customer contact employees. We found that customer mood did affect employees’ mood and their emotional labor perceptions, and that employees’ self-monitoring moderated the relationship between customer mood and employees’ emotional labor perception. Additionally, when customers were in a good mood, employees’ emotional labor perception was negatively related to employees’ service performance, while employees’ self-monitoring moderated the relationship between customer mood and employee mood. When employees were in a bad mood, the degree of social support they obtained moderated the relationship between their mood and service performance. Managerial implications and suggestions for future research were also provided.	social support	Perng-Fei Huang;Chia-Wen Dai	2010	IJEBM		public relations;applied psychology;business;social psychology	HCI	-89.29173656781988	-11.314468924827777	175201

In answering the question of how e-business customers develop initial trust especially in unknown online retailers, we propose a model with a two-factor initial trust model (competence and goodwill) and three different types of predictors: two trustee's characteristic-based factors (company profile and website quality), one institution-based factor (third-party support) and one trustor's personality-based factor (propensity to trust). This model was empirically tested and we found some evidence that website quality and third-party support had significant effect on initial trust. Company profile and propensity to trust didn't have any direct effects on initial trust, but a type of propensity to trust showed some moderating effects.	online shopping	Euijin Kim;Suresh Tadisina	2010	IJBIS	10.1504/IJBIS.2010.035740	e-commerce;public relations;the internet;economics;computer science;marketing;competence;electronic business;empirical research;management;world wide web;commerce	ECom	-89.79566090133324	-11.851524464167474	175439

a4814081c3d1e4b1f9fe37361f9aec6fc0de6c51	potential for discrimination in online targeted advertising		Recently, online targeted advertising platforms like Facebook have been criticized for allowing advertisers to discriminate against users belonging to sensitive groups, i.e., to exclude users belonging to a certain race or gender from receiving their ads. Such criticisms have led, for instance, Facebook to disallow the use of attributes such as ethnic affinity from being used by advertisers when targeting ads related to housing or employment or financial services. In this paper, we show that such measures are far from sufficient and that the problem of discrimination in targeted advertising is much more pernicious. We argue that discrimination measures should be based on the targeted population and not on the attributes used for targeting. We systematically investigate the different targeting methods offered by Facebook for their ability to enable discriminatory advertising. We show that a malicious advertiser can create highly discriminatory ads without using sensitive attributes. Our findings call for exploring fundamentally new methods for mitigating discrimination in online targeted advertising.	affinity analysis;high- and low-level;ibm notes;malware;online advertising;personally identifiable information;population;processor affinity;sensor;software propagation	Till Speicher;Muhammad Ali;Giridhari Venkatadri;Filipe Nunes Ribeiro;George Arvanitakis;Fabrício Benevenuto;Krishna P.

Although the extant research has studied the effect of design elements, such as product presentation, recommendation agents, and image and text on consumer choice, little is known about how Internet vendors could distribute products in a multi-page online product catalog for better performance. It is well-known that the first page of an online product catalog is particularly important to a vendor. Based on price signaling literature and cue consistency theory, this study investigates how price and product popularity cues could be carefully designed for the first page to achieve better sale performance. This study suggests there is a delicate balance point where price cues and popularity cues can achieve consistency and synergy and lead to better page value perceptions for the first page. The boosted page value perceptions, in turn, lead to better sales from the first page.

The author previously developed a computational model, called an inference space model, that predicts potency-magnitude relations of eWOM messages involving subjective rank expressions, which refer to the linguistic representations related to the attitude-levels of the benefits of product attributes. This paper mathematically investigates the potencymagnitude relations of message types differentiating the attitude direction and the strength. The investigations include the developments of a Q-magnitude Relation Map (Q-Map) which illustrates how the relations change based on the values of two parameters: evaluation target size and scale-size balancing indicator. The results show that three scale-classes of bipolar rating scales have a critical role in knowing how the relations change. Based on observations of the Q-Maps, unexplored hypotheses on the potency-magnitude relations are developed with respect to messages involving attitude direction without its strength.	computation;computational model;information source	Kazunori Fujimoto	2013	2013 IEEE 12th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics and Cognitive Computing	10.1109/ICCI-CC.2013.6622257	psychology;artificial intelligence;communication;social psychology	SE	-90.85079863131095	-13.53206066554533	176274

The study will focus on three major online industries – online bookstores, travel websites, and online retail – and take an empirical analysis using a questionnaire. Results from the survey of Taiwan websites are as follows: 1 Marketing’s influence and cross-functional interactions play a mediating role, which enables strategy typology and market orientation to influence business performance. 2 Differentiation strategies and market orientation are positively related to both marketing’s influence and cross-functional interactions, and a lowcost strategy is positively related to cross-functional interactions. 3 Other marketing’s influence and cross-functional interaction influence business performance positively. 4 The dimensions (contingency, structure, performance) of one industry are different from those of other industries.	biological anthropology;e-commerce;interaction;online shopping	Jyh-Jeng Wu	2004	IJSTM	10.1504/IJSTM.2004.004299	e-commerce;public relations;digital marketing;marketing management;business marketing;computer science;marketing research;marketing;influencer marketing;marketing strategy;quantitative marketing research;profit impact of marketing strategy;world wide web;relationship marketing;commerce	Web+IR	-88.64441571978571	-11.658475958403198	177324

The user interface to implement and the influence of the interface on various process and outcome measures, however, are not well understood. We developed a Flow-based model consisting of seven hypotheses regarding the user interface and its consequents. We conducted a field experiment to test an attribute-based interface vs. a questionbased interface on three variables (perceived control, shopping enjoyment and choice satisfaction) as well as two web site intentions: intention to return and intention to purchase. Six of the seven hypotheses were supported in a parsimonious model. Variance explained was 16.3% for perceived control, 45.6% for shopping enjoyment, 59.3% for choice satisfaction and 63.1% for web site intentions. The main finding is that an attribute-based interface for retail eshopping increases the shopper’s sense of control and feeling of enjoyment in the process more than a question-based interface, and thereby increases satisfaction with the outcome. This combination of influences increases the intention of the shopper to return to the web site and to purchase the item. We discuss the results and suggest areas for future research in user-customization, which may apply to many different industries that engage in online commerce.	e-commerce;occam's razor;user interface	Arnold Kamis;Tziporah Stern;Daniel M.

Thus, a structural equation model is developed and several hypotheses are tested based on 157 Chinese College-graduate Village Officials' samples. Results showed that three social network dimensions, which are network size, network heterogeneity, properties of top node, affect entrepreneurial intentions significantly. Specifically, entrepreneurial intention is negatively correlated with properties of top node, and the size of the social network; a significant positive correlation is found between heterogeneity of social network and entrepreneurial intentions. Besides, Entrepreneurial desirability and entrepreneurial feasibility are two mediators between network heterogeneity and entrepreneurial intension. This work has also found that social networks sometimes may become an obstacle for College-graduate Village Official to start a business.

Incorporating commitment theory from social psychology and management science literature, this paper proposes an IS continuance model that explains why some IS technologies enjoy continued use after adoption and others are often relegated to the basement as shelfware. This paper uses a technology commitment perspective to unravel why adopted technologies experience mixed success. Specifically, the authors argue that IS continuance may be best understood by investigating user commitment toward specific technologies. Three components of technology commitment, that is, affective commitment, calculative commitment, and normative commitment, are used to formulate a research model. The model is empirically tested in the context of instant messaging software. Results show a strong support for the model and explicate commitment differentials among users across different brands of instant messaging software. The study ends with a discussion of the results and their implications for research and practice.	instant messaging	Y.

c7e614040c0308ddbaa5a7f47ffdf15c5609daa4	effects of review spam in a firm-initiated virtual brand community: evidence from smartphone customers		Abstract Previous studies of spam focus on how to develop effective and efficient algorithms and technologies to monitor, identify, and filter spam to minimize its negative consequences. Few studies have examined the social and psychological impacts of spam on social media users and participants of virtual brand communities (VBCs). This paper develops and tests a research model to explain the mechanism of how review spam influences customer participation in VBCs. We collected both objective data and subjective data from smartphone users in China. We also developed a measure of review spam using objective data. We found that hyper review had positive effects on membership and influence (two dimensions of sense of virtual communities (SOVC)), while the effects of defaming review on membership and influence were negative. Neither hyper view nor defaming review impacted immersion (the third dimension of SOVC). Further, non-review had negative effects on all three dimensions of SOVC that positively influenced future customer participation.	smartphone;spamming	Nan Feng;Zhenjing Su;Dahui Li;Chundong Zheng;Minqiang Li	2018	Information & Management	10.1016/j.im.2018.05.012	marketing;immersion (virtual reality);brand community;social media;engineering	HCI	-88.2674273277531	-14.073954021122038	179223

Drawing upon control theory and regulatory focus theory, this study investigates the relationships among regulatory focus, reward, punishment, and compliance behavior in mandatory IT settings. Survey data were collected from 186 employees in companies where enterprise resource planning (ERP) compliance was mandated. Analyses reveal that punishment expectancy is a strong determinant of compliance behavior, whereas the main effect of reward expectancy is not significant. Moreover, the relationship between reward expectancy and compliance behavior is moderated by promotion focus and the relationship between punishment expectancy and compliance behavior is moderated by prevention focus. This study provides an in-depth understanding of reward and punishment in mandatory IT settings and suggests that regulatory foc...

Nevertheless, this service has not been widely used, because of users are still scared of the risks of online transactions. Thus, the in-depth and distinct works of risks in risk awareness are an essential and meaningful assignment for the banking sector. This study investigates the role of perceived risk on intention to use online banking. The results of SEM (structural equation modelling) evidence risk factors (privacy risk, security risk, social risk, time risk, and financial-performance risk) in perceived risk, which has a negative effect on intention to use online banking in Vietnam. Research results can help to propose solutions for enhancing the safety and mitigating the risks in online banking.	confirmatory factor analysis;discriminant;e-commerce;exploratory factor analysis;first-order predicate;online banking;reliability engineering;structural equation modeling	Thanh D.

c95249079a923d508772f4b6396443fd3720041a	examining impacts of technostress on the professional salesperson's performance		This paper explores technostress in the context of the professional sales area. This area is unique in that sales professionals prefer to spend time with customers in developing interpersonal relationships, rather than on technology related tasks. At the same time, the modern sales environment requires the use of IS such as sales force automation applications. The sales role also offers increased possibility of role stress and very high expectations for technology-enabled performance, making this an ideal context to explore how technostress operates through role stress in negatively impacting technology-enabled performance. It also means that finding ways to mitigate this negative impact is of strategic importance, and a review of the sales technology literature points to self-efficacy as a potential factor to reduce the effects of technostress. Integrating literature from technostress, sales and social cognitive theory, we explore the relationships between technostress, role stress, technology self-efficacy and technology-enabled performance among business-to-business salespeople. Our findings show a positive association between technostress and role stress, and a negative one between role stress and performance. We find that technology self-efficacy can counter the decrease in performance and increase in role stress due to technostress. Theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed.	sales force management system	Monideepa Tarafdar;Ellen Bolman Pullins;T. S.

df433cc50c303a0e6a7903d2a297134ef3173c9c	impact of credibility on opinion analysis in social media		In conjunction with the rapid growth and adoption of social media, people are more and more willing to share their personal experiences and opinions about products and/or services with the community. Opinions could be the basis of developing systems that would advise future users on how to proceed with any purchase without risking any disappointment. Unfortunately, opinions are not always genuine due to for instance, biased users as well as mixed feedback coming from the same users (i.e., multi-identity). This paper presents an approach for opinion analysis using credibility as a decisive criterion for supporting future users make sound decisions. The effectiveness of this approach has been tested using opinions posted on Twitter.	social media	Fatima Zohra Ennaji;Lobna Azaza;Zakaria Maamar;Abdelaziz El Fazziki;Marinette Savonnet;Mohammed Sadgal;Eric Leclercq;Idir Amine Amarouche;Djamal Benslimane	2018	Fundam.

In discussion boards, customers post questions about products and receive answers from their peers. The sustainability of discussion boards depends on attracting volunteers who are willing to contribute answers to posted questions. Many IT firms use token recognition, such as titles, profiles, or lists of top 10 contributors, to motivate customer contribution. However, little is known about the effects of such incentives. By studying half a million postings collectively from the technical support discussion boards of four different IT companies, we find that some incentives can cannibalize socially based processes and reduce customer contribution. Our findings have implications for service firms as they strive to increase customer knowledge coproduction in service activities.

But, while much existing research examines how formal reputation signals, like ratings or reviews, enhance trust and facilitate market transactions, almost no research explores the role of networked social signals in generating trust in such marketplaces. Here, we measure the extent to which situating transactions in networks can generate trust in online marketplaces with an empirical approach that provides external validity while eliminating many potential confounds. Using micro-level data on ~1.6M sales posts in Facebook buy and sell groups, we find that both increased network density and seller degree centrality increase two-sided interest in transacting. These results suggest that network structure can produce trust in marketplace transactions and imply that network-based trust mechanisms can offer an appealing alternative to formal reputation systems in mitigating moral hazard and adverse selection in digital marketplaces.	centrality;computational trust;external validity;moral hazard;online marketplace;reputation system;social structure	David Holtz;Diana L.

Response times vary considerably, and the chronemics of email are an important non-verbal cue which can convey meaning as well as influence interactional coherence. While privacy and technical challenges have so far limited quantitative assessment of responsiveness chronemics, an opportunity became available with the recent release into the public domain of an unprecedentedly large corporate collection of private email messages. An analysis of over 16,000 responses extracted from a large database of email messages created by Enron employees was performed. Responsiveness profiles of individual users and of all users are described, and their aggregate temporal distribution is evaluated. The generalizability of these findings as well as their implication to current theory on email response times is discussed.	aggregate data;database;email;responsiveness	Yoram M.

Abstract Having the advantage of reaching massive audience, mainstream media can frequently influence public opinions and attitudes. However, recent statistical data shows that the average user stickiness of mainstream media websites is much lower, in comparison with other types of media websites in China. To gain insights into this phenomenon, we construct a model to examine the impacts of various website attributes and user influence on user stickiness. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that media website attributes and user characteristics have different effects on user stickiness. Our results shed fresh light on how to enhance mainstream media website user stickiness in a competitive and ever-evolving landscape.

We examine the limitations of such an approach and discuss future plans to incorporate this approach into the development of an automated system for helping users define privacy policy. As part of future work, we discuss how to define/expand policy to the entire social network. We also present additional collected data similar to other studies such as perceived tie strength and information revelation preferences for OSN users.		Lerone D.

While the cause on the supply side is well-known, research on the demand side has largely focused on the awareness effect of online information that helps consumers discover new and often niche products. This study expands the demand side factors by showing that online information also influences the long tail phenomenon through the informative effect, which affects consumersu0027 evaluation of product quality. We examine the informative effect in the context of online WOM. Two sets of theories suggest opposite directions for the implication of the informative effect. Information search and information cascade literatures indicate that WOM provides additional information to consumers, reduces the occurrence of information cascade, and encourages the formation of long tail. Studies on behavior heuristics, however, suggest that consumers tend to ignore online information inconsistent with their prior beliefs, which leads to a rich-gets-richer effect for popular products and curtail the formation of the long tail. We empirically examine the conflict by analyzing different impacts of online WOM across product popularity and WOM ratings. Using a panel data collected from Amazon.com, we show that positive reviews improve the sales of popular products more than the sales of niche products, while negative reviews hurt niche products more than popular products. The results are consistent with the prediction of the behavior heuristic and suggest that online WOM restrains the formation of long tail.	long tail	Bin Gu;Qian Tang;Andrew B.

We have defined the index of the trend leader with the criteria for the day and the sales number. Using with the results, we are able to make detailed decisions in the following three points: 1) to make appropriate recommendations to the other group member based on the transitions of the trend leaders' preferences; 2) to evaluate the effect of the recommendation with the trend leaders' preferences; and 3) to improve the retail management processes: prevention from the stock-out, sales promotion for early purchase effects and the increase of the numbers of sales.	point of sale	Masakazu Takahashi;Kazuhiko Tsuda;Takao Terano	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04592-9_36	public relations;marketing;sales management;advertising;business	DB	-90.07881723738019	-11.881254515876702	184651

The authors discuss three fields of knowledge—usability, human computer interaction (HCI) and branding—and demonstrate how each field alone is insufficient but taken together they can enlighten all perspectives of communication through the Internet. By measuring the relationships between user (customer) and site (firm), they show how usability, cultural background and group affiliation influence general perception.

Our longitudinal analysis shows, among other things, that the bandwidth share distributions – and thus bandwidth differences – exhibit considerable path dependence where country proportions of international bandwidth in 2011 can be substantially accounted for by a preferential attachment based mixture of micro-level processes. Interestingly, our preferential attachment model, consistent with empirical data, does not predict increasing concentration of bandwidth within top ranked countries. We argue that recognizing the strong, but nuanced, historical inertia of bandwidth distributions is helpful in better discriminating among competing theoretical perspectives on the global digital divide as well as in clarifying policy discussions related to gaps between bandwidth rich and bandwidth poor countries.	attachments;bandwidth management;mixture model;path dependence	Hyunjin Seo;Stuart Thorson	2016	JASIST	10.1002/asi.23523	the internet;telecommunications;computer science;connectivity;operations research;law;world wide web;bandwidth	Networks	-85.01115332095604	-15.413162791471041	185625

Drawing upon data from a 2012 sample of 1100 Seoul citizens, findings reveal that greater use of e-government websites is negatively related to citizens' satisfaction and perceptions of public sector trustworthiness. Conversely, use of public sector social media accounts is positively related to satisfaction and perceptions of public sector trustworthiness. Drawing upon the concept of psychological distance, these findings are interpreted to suggest that forms of e-government conducive to the transmission of less detailed information (social media) may bemore effective at improving relationships between citizens and their government than forms of e-government that are more commonly used to transmit detailed information (e-government websites). © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the outcomes of a barcamp are largely unknown before the event. This raises the question of the participants' motivations to attend and contribute. To answer this question, we conducted an exploratory empirical study at Barcamp Graz 2012. We applied a mixed-method approach: first we used a socio-demographic questionnaire (n=99) which allowed us to characterize the 'typical barcamper'. Second, we conducted qualitative interviews (n=10) to get a deeper understanding of the participants' motivations to attend, expectations, and the use of social media in that context. We identified three concepts, which could be deducted from the interviews: people, format and topics. We found that the motivation to attend and even a common identity is quite strongly based on these three factors. Furthermore, the results indicate that participants share a set of activities and methods by following the barcamp's inherent rules and make extensive use of social media.	hoc (programming language);social media	Sebastian Dennerlein;Robert Gutounig;Peter Kraker;Rene Kaiser;Romana Rauter;Julian Ausserhofer	2013		10.1145/2494188.2494208	public relations;knowledge management;political science;social psychology	HCI	-86.58405036644523	-16.175907743897763	186569

2db9516be019d82ec0f57393e2f9e2571e855049	beyond quality and accessibility: source selection in consumer health information searching	user studies;citation searching;information seeking	A systematic understanding of factors and criteria that affect consumers’ selection of sources for health information is necessary for the design of effective health information services and information systems. However, current studies have overly focused on source attributes as indicators for 2 criteria, source quality and accessibility, and overlooked the role of other factors and criteria that help determine source selection. To fill this gap, guided by decision-making theories and the cognitive perspective to information search, we interviewed 30 participants about their reasons for using a wide range of sources for health information. Additionally, we asked each of them to report a critical incident in which sources were selected to fulfill a specific information need. Based on the analysis of the transcripts, 5 categories of factors were identified as influential to source selection: source-related factors, user-related factors, user-source relationships, characteristics of the problematic situation, and social influences. In addition, about a dozen criteria that mediate the influence of the factors on source-selection decisions were identified, including accessibility, quality, usability, interactivity, relevance, usefulness, familiarity, affection, anonymity, and appropriateness. These results significantly expanded the current understanding of the nature of costs and benefits involved in source-selection decisions, and strongly indicated that a personalized approach is needed for information services and information systems to provide effective access to health information sources for consumers.	accessibility;common criteria;experience;futures studies;information needs;information source;information system;interactivity;norm (social);personalization;relevance;social media;stepping level;theory;usability	Yan Zhang	2014	JASIST	10.1002/asi.23023	knowledge management;data mining;information quality;world wide web	HCI	-88.64161717875213	-15.837057385784146	188411

One benefit of actively involving the public on key governmental decisions is the belief that it enhances the public’s trust and/or confidence in government. Does it make a difference in the public’s confidence assessments which public engagement technique is used? If enhancing the public’s trust/confidence is a specific objective of a public engagement, which technique is to be preferred? This article presents public trust and confidence data we have been collecting as part of ongoing public engagements in Lincoln, Nebraska, USA. We compare differences in the public’s trust and confidence in government as a function of online input versus phone surveys versus face-to-face discussions. Results suggest that there are significant differences in the public’s trust and confidence in government as a function of the type of engagement. Engagements that expose residents to governmental officials in a more salient way may be superior for increasing public trust and confidence compared to those engagements that involve less exposure to governmental officials.	municipal wireless network	Alan J.

In order to help link website design and investment decisions to the strategy for retaining customers, we propose a model by extending the user satisfaction perspective into research on online service continuance. We empirically tested the model within the context of a social network service. The analysis results found that website information satisfaction and system satisfaction play key roles in forming continuance intention through perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment. It is also noted that computer anxiety serves as an important moderator toward continuance intention. Theoretical and practical implications are offered for better understanding of the role of the IT artifact in online service post-adoption phenomena. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

822e327bda9f4f986f273d5440b2660ffd1c371e	logistics service design for cross-border e-commerce using kansei engineering with text-mining-based online content analysis	text mining;kansei engineering;partial least squares;service design;cross border logistics service	A procedure of integrating text mining into Kansei engineering (KE) is proposed.Kansei design for cross-border logistics services (CBLS) is studied.Text mining provides an alternative way to capture customer Kansei toward CBLS.KE and text mining can play a complementary role in developing CBLS design ideas. With the rapid development of cross-border e-commerce, the demand for and importance of cross-border logistics service (CBLS) also increase. A satisfactory CBLS can help promote business activities in cross-border e-commerce. Because customers logistical needs are increasingly complex and the logistics market is increasingly competitive, a CBLS provider has to be devoted to continually improving and differentiating services to maintain its competitive advantage. Kansei engineering (KE) is an approach to design the elements which satisfy customers affective and emotional perceptions into services and products. In this study, the KE approach is applied to derive ideas for the development of CBLS. For this purpose, Partial Least Squares (PLS) is used to analyze the relationships between the feelings of customers and service elements of CBLS. Moreover, this study demonstrates the applications of text mining techniques to analyze the online contents regarding CBLS. Online content mining assists in identifying the service elements and Kansei words for CBLS. Importantly, the relationship between the feelings of customers and service elements of CBLS obtained by online content mining provides complementary results for CBLS design.Relevance to industry: this study offers an exemplification on applying the integration of Kansei engineering and online content analysis to obtain ideas for the process Kansei design in service industry. Our findings imply that in addition to conventional customer survey, user generated online content analysis should be effective way of catching customer-oriented design elements; they provide complementary effects for Kansei design.	e-commerce payment system;exemplification;knowledge engineering;logistics;partial least squares regression;relevance;text mining;web content	Yu-Hsiang Hsiao;Mu-Chen Chen;Wei-Chien Liao	2017	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2016.08.002	e-commerce;competitive advantage;marketing;exemplification;kansei engineering;computer science;service design;kansei;online content analysis;text mining	Web+IR	-91.00392924891723	-11.795413759249309	189407

The introduction and popularity of Mozilla Firefox Web browser provided an ideal empirical setting for this study. Drawing upon literature on post-adoption user behavior, consumer behavior, and online user research, we propose a research model and validate it using cross-sectional field data collected from 306 users on their decision to switch from Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) to Mozilla Firefox. Findings suggest that user satisfaction and breadth of use of the incumbent product are negatively associated with switching behavior. Perceived ease of use, relative advantage, and perceived security of the substitute product are positively associated with switching behavior. In addition, the effects of perceived ease of use and relative advantage are not moderated by user experience. This study contributes to both research and practice by advancing our understanding of information technology (IT) users' post-adoption behavior in general and their switching behavior on Web-related IT products specifically. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	user experience	Chen Ye;DongBack Seo;Kevin C.

This paper offers new insights on the motives and antecedents of the reading behaviour of consumer reviews in online opinion platforms. This research was carried out from 2005 to 2008 using a case study approach. The case involved working with a prominent and successful online opinion platform (CIAO.com). The company was so successful it was purchased by Microsoft for $486 million in 2008 and is now incorporated into their main search engine which is still a market leader today. The research highlights four different types of motives that drive customers to read online reviews: decision-involvement, product-involvement, social-involvement and economic-involvement motives. The outcomes also demonstrated four different new types of motives: self-involvement motives, consumer-empowerment motives, new social-involvement motives and site-administration motives. Several related themes were also investigated, such as the preference for reading or writing online reviews and the reasons for choosing one over the other. The research tested the relevance of the online reading motives and their influence on consumer buying and communication behaviour. In summary, some theoretical and practical implications are highlighted and discussed.		Marwan Khammash;Gareth H. Griffiths	2011	Int J.

Based on such theories as customer engagement, value co-creation, and relationship marketing, this paper presents a model of the influence of customer engagement on stickiness. Data collected from 260 valid questionnaires from Sina’s enterprise microblog users were analyzed by structural equation modeling. Empirical results show that customer engagement has a direct and positive influence on customer stickiness as well as an indirect influence through customer value creation.

This paper studies the nature of cyber credit from the perspective of social capital. We propose the credit assessment model using social capital variables extracted from the reputation system of an e-commerce platform and the associated online social network. In addition, we consider the dynamic and diversified effects of online reputation on sellers’ cyber credit, and we verify the rationality of the credit assessment model through analyzing the relationship between cyber credit and social network variables. We take Alibaba C2C e-commerce market as our experimental study platform and use the social networking information from Sina’s microblogging services. We find that social capital variables can be used to effectively measure the cyber credit of online sellers in C2C businesses.

61f207b1819bd705d9a2cf908c6b614defa7e90d	awareness of behavioral tracking and information privacy concern in facebook and google		Internet companies record data about users as they surf the web, such as the links they have clicked on, search terms they have used, and how often they read all the way to the end of an online news article. This evidence of past behavior is aggregated both across websites and across individuals, allowing algorithms to make inferences about users’ habits and personal characteristics. Do users recognize when their behaviors provision information that may be used in this way, and is this knowledge associated with concern about unwanted access to information about themselves they would prefer not to reveal? In this online experiment, the majority of a sample of web-savvy users was aware that Internet companies like Facebook and Google can collect data about their actions on these websites, such as what links they click on. However, this awareness was associated with lower likelihood of concern about unwanted access. Awareness of the potential consequences of data aggregation, such as Facebook or Google knowing what other websites one visits or one’s political party affiliation, was associated with greater likelihood of reporting concern about unwanted access. This suggests that greater transparency about inferences enabled by data aggregation might help users associate seemingly innocuous actions like clicking on a link with what these actions say about them.	algorithm;data aggregation;freedom of information laws by country;information privacy;speeded up robust features	Emilee J.

Successful development of such personalisation products is the challenge to R&D managers. Additionally, existing products that are shared among a group of users can also be personalised and become individually owned products. This research first defines personalisation as a process, through which products are adopted to personalise consumer goods. Derived from adoption theories of innovation and personalisation, this research aims to explain the adoption of products for personalisation. Using mobile phones as the example, the developed theoretical framework is empirically tested. The findings indicate that some classical attributes of innovations including relative advantage, ease of use and observability are influential to personalisation adoption.

52cbd21f1d925e0e83443ef9f6e80b4b7f7ab165	a tangled web: evaluating the impact of displaying fraudulent reviews		The growing interest in social media for legitimate promotion has been accompanied by an increasing number of fraudulent reviews. Beyond fraud detection, little is known about what review portals should do with fraudulent reviews after detecting them. In this paper, we study how consumers respond to potentially fraudulent reviews and how review portals can leverage such knowledge to design better fraud management policies. To do so, we combine randomized experiments with statistical learning using large-scale archival data from Yelp. Our experiments show that consumers tend to expand the variety of their choice set during product search and to increase their trust towards the review portal when it displays fraudulent reviews along with non-fraudulent reviews, rather than censor fraudulent information. Finally, our archival analysis using a Maximum Likelihood Estimation method allows us to design a novel fraud-awareness reputation system that platforms can deploy to better improve consumer trust and decision making.

But the Internet penetration growth does not commensurate with the online retail sales. This necessitates unraveling and understanding the online buying behavior. This paper employs 'Theory of planned behavior TPB', 'Technology acceptance model TAM' and self-image to unfold the online consumer behavior. It proffers an integrated model of online consumer behavior by integrating the self-image variable with the TPB and TAM models. The study tests the various components of integrated model and find that attitudes, subjective norms, self-image, and self-efficacy significantly impact online purchase intentions. The study makes significant theoretical contributions and provides valuable insights into the consumers' online purchase behavior.	ibm tivoli access manager	Devinder Pal Singh	2015	IJOM	10.4018/IJOM.2015010102	marketing;advertising;business;commerce	HCI	-88.64519832475857	-10.890026446261642	191074

Knowledge-based trust is especially important for online business environments where there are repeated transactions between fixed pairs of consumers and merchants. Building on previous studies of trust, this paper examines the proposition that players' knowledge about website characteristics (i.e., security and interface design) and about website outputs (i.e., online game quality and service quality) has an effect on the development of trust in the context of online game websites. The impact of trust on building an effective online game website is also investigated. A conceptual model of knowledge-based trust is tested with questionnaire responses of 253 online game players. Overall, the results indicate that all of these four classes of knowledge engender trust and that trust helps develop effective online game websites.		Clyde W.

We further explore the role of promotional tools on persistence and drug choice, and we investigate whether physicians who exhibit persistence respond differently to three forms of sales promotion: one-to-one meetings (detailing), out-of-office meetings, and symposium meetings.#R##N##R##N#Our results show significant levels of physician persistence in drug choice. We find that persistence is mostly a cross-sectional physician feature. Nonpersistent physicians appear to be responsive to detailing and symposium meetings, whereas persistent physicians seem to be responsive only to symposium meetings. Out-of-office meetings, such as golf or lunch, have no effect on physicians' drug choice. We also find that (1) older physicians and those who work in smaller practices are more likely to be persistent and (2) physicians who are more willing to receive sales force representatives have a lower likelihood of being persistent.

5e772007554a62c0683ac51c080544b621b6045b	rebuilding consumer trust in ecommerce relationships	ecommerce;trust;trust relationships	Several researchers have studied trust in the electronic commerce context. Much of this work is aimed at establishing initial trust, with some recent research on maintaining on-going trust between consumer and vendor. This paper examines a related aspect of trust in the e-Commerce environment, namely trust violations and their subsequent repair. It draws upon research in professional trust relationships and adapts it to the e-Commerce context. It proposes a conceptual model that relates trust violation characteristics, vendor reconciliation tactics, and individual consumer characteristics as relevant determinants of the consumer's willingness to reconcile. Given the large range of possible trust violations in on-line purchases, and increasing competition among vendors, it becomes imperative for earnest vendors to provide sincere opportunities to repair the trusting relationship with devoted consumers.	e-commerce;imperative programming;online and offline;process modeling;purchasing;trust (emotion);ws-trust	Jae Choi;Derek L.

1ad1ea89d6ae62104d157acb7141b70cf6f2333a	the influence of website functionality, drivers and perceived risk on customer satisfaction in online shopping: an emerging economy case		The study analyzed website functionality, perceived risk and drivers of online shopping to evaluate their impact on customer satisfaction in India. The study empirically validates ease of ordering, Cash-on-delivery mode of payment, website functionality and different facets of perceived risk with Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) (Venkatesh et al. in MIS Q 36(1):157–178, 2012). Findings of the study revealed that perceived risk had a negative relation with customer satisfaction where as the website functionality and drivers were positively associated with customer satisfaction. The research will help online retailers to recognize the important success factors that instill confidence among the consumers in developing economies. The study will also help online retailers to focus in the right direction to eliminate threats and convert non shoppers to online shoppers. The study throws light on a new aspect to research by validating the role of cash-on-delivery (COD) mode of payment as a construct and ease of ordering as new dimension to UTAUT2.	device driver;management information systems quarterly;online shopping;threat (computer)	Urvashi Tandon;Ravi Kiran;Ash N.

This study sheds light on consumer attitudinal responses, namely attitudes toward the corporate and product brand, by examining the effects of sequencing rational and emotional appeals in marketing messages. Using a between-subjects experiment and a stratified random sample, the study found that using an emotional-rational message sequence produces more favorable product brand attitudes among consumers as compared to using a rational-emotional message sequence. However, message sequencing had no significant effects on consumers' attitudes toward the corporate brand. Implications, limitations, and future research directions from the study's findings are discussed.	stratified sampling	Weng Marc Lim;Pei-Lee Teh;Pervaiz Khalid Ahmed	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management	10.1109/IEEM.2014.7058863	public relations;appeal to emotion;economics;marketing;advertising;brand awareness;consumer behaviour	Visualization	-89.36653557437882	-12.839850074888266	195656

As compared to having no idea exposure, exposure to an original idea decreased fluency and increased the average originality of ideas generated by each person. By contrast, exposure to a common idea had no effect on either idea originality or fluency. However, the two exposure conditions showed no significant difference in either fluency or idea originality. The semantic similarity between a stimulus idea and the first idea generated was higher when the stimulus was common, as opposed to original, as measured by latent semantic analysis. The implications of these results for research and practice are discussed.	conformity;crowdsourcing;latent semantic analysis;semantic similarity	Kai Wang;Jeffrey V.

0aa4e41c81837f37a0ba928cc060782d0b63b9b5	exploring the impact of restrictive default privacy settings on the privacy calculus on social network sites		Research about self-disclosure on social network sites (SNS) is based on the assumption that all entered personal information is publicly available by default. Literature lacks empirical insights on how restrictive default privacy settings influence the privacy calculus and the self-disclosure on SNS. To gain empirical insight we analyzed how the perception of users regarding the benefits and privacy costs of self-disclosure on SNS changes by making users aware of restrictive default privacy settings. The results of our exploratory study using Facebook show that making users aware of restrictive default privacy settings significantly changes the perceived benefit of relationship maintenance and the perceived privacy costs of privacy concerns and the likelihood of a privacy violation.	personally identifiable information;privacy;security through obscurity;social network	Markus Tschersich;Reinhardt A.
