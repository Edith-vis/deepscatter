Data are being collected in laboratory studies where subjects interact through a computer-mediated decision support system. This paper presents the major research hypotheses, a theoretical framework for the study, describes the methodology, and presents preliminary results for two of the hypotheses. This research aims to make a significant contribution to understanding information exchange in teams.	computer-mediated communication;decision support system;information exchange	Babajide Osatuyi;Starr Roxanne Hiltz;Jerry Fjermestad	2012	2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2012.568	information exchange;decision support system;shape;computer science;knowledge management;group method of data handling;management science;group	Robotics	-87.02511859626651	0.07725916735793391	161510

Implicit in this approach is the assumption that teams are stable in their membership and internal organization. In practice, however, such stability is rare, because the composition and structure of teams often change over time (e.g., between projects). In this paper, we use detailed data from an Indian software services firm to examine how such changes may affect the accumulation of experience within, and the performance of, teams. We find that the level of team familiarity (i.e., the average number of times that each member has worked with every other member of the team) has a significant positive effect on performance, but we observe that conventional measures of the experience of individual team members (e.g., years at the firm) are not consistently related to performance. We do find, however, that the role experience of individuals in a team (i.e., years in a given role within a team) is associated with better team performance. Our results offer an approach for capturing the experience held by fluid teams and highlight the need to study context-specific measures of experience, including role experience. In addition, our findings provide insight into how the interactions of team members may contribute to the development of broader firm capabilities.	ieee xplore	Robert S. Huckman;Bradley R.

In this paper, we adopt social network analysis, graph theory and data mining techniques to analyze groups in a community at their different project periods. Each group is presented by several attributes that are computed from social network analysis and graph theory to represent various interactions of the group members. The evolution of these attributes enables the discovery of the interaction patterns of different groups in their life cycles. With these discoveries, team leaders can obtain concise information about their teams’ performance, and community managers can cluster groups to capture stereotypes of virtual teams in the community. Such knowledge will benefit group development in a community.	cohesion (computer science);data mining;effective method;graph theory;interaction;interaction design pattern;social network analysis	Fu-Ren Lin;Chun-Hung Chen;Kuo-Lung Tsai	2003		10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174266	biological life cycle;community development;social network analysis;the internet;computer science;knowledge management;graph theory;data science;data mining;world wide web	HCI	-89.94266238728473	-1.0321742620148935	163478

An important aspect of what determines a good team model is the extent to which the model is shared by the team members. This paper presents suggestions for measuring the extent to which teams have a shared mental model and describes how these measures are related to team performance. The most promising measures of sharedness proposed so far rely on using a compositional approach for team modeling and on a situation-sensitive relevance relation that indicates to what extent components contribute to team performance. A case study illustrates the approach and initial results on measuring performance when teams use different levels of sharedness.	complexity;experiment;mental model;relevance	Catholijn M. Jonker;M.

The proposed model—a modification of Kauffman's NK model—has the property that team performance decreases as the size of the team increases. Analytical results and computer simulations show how team size, the amount of supervision, worker performance, interaction among employees, relationships between management and labor, and leadership skill affect when a team should be split. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study examines the multitude of measures of GSS success which have been employed in this research and organises them into categories previously used to study information systems (IS) success, namely systems and information quality, use, user satisfaction, and individual and organisational impact. An extensive literature analysis of 210 GSS papers was undertaken and 95 were identified which collected data concerned with the measurement of GSS success in some way. The analysis reveals a variety of success measures and of different instruments used for each success measure. It reveals gaps in the study of GSS success, suggests research opportunities in areas such as system quality and use, information quality, and organisational impact, and recommends more work in the field.<>	recommender system	Graham Pervan	1994			meta-analysis;decision support system;computer science;knowledge management;human factors and ergonomics;management science;information quality;world wide web;information system	HCI	-88.09446067496461	-2.444306657061245	166700

The risk of communication breakdowns increases due to cultural and organizational differences grounded in the geographical distribution of the participants. Such breakdowns indicate general misunderstandings and a lack of shared meaning between participants. In this paper, we address the complexity of building shared meaning. We examine the communication breakdowns that occurred in two globally distributed virtual teams by providing an analytical distinction of the organizational context as the foundation for building shared meaning at three levels. Also we investigate communication breakdowns that can be attributed to differences in lifeworld structures, organizational structures, and work process structures within a virtual team. We find that all communication breakdowns are manifested and experienced by the participants at the work process level; however, resolving breakdowns may require critical reflection at other levels. Where previous research argues that face-to-face interaction is an important variable for virtual team performance, our empirical observations reveal that communication breakdowns related to a lack of shared meaning at the lifeworld level often becomes more salient when the participants are co-located than when geographically distributed. Last, we argue that creating translucence in communication structures is essential for building shared meanings at all three levels.		Pernille Bjørn;Ojelanki K. Ngwenyama	2009	Inf. Syst.

74953093e7d124ec07b62466e4d8c3f048a20d6b	an analysis of web-based document management and communication tools usage among project managers		The article analyzes modern cloud document management systems and communication tools from the viewpoint of a EU project managers, who lead multidisciplinary, multilingual and international teams. It also explores the types of users who use these tools as well as the motivation factors guiding their choices. The research includes observation within the project group, interviews and semi-structured surveys among 40 EU project managers, who have managed 244 EU projects. The main finding is that a lot of project managers still don't use shared, cloud document system. The biggest obstacle to more efficient usage of existing systems is their un-friendliness, security concerns and lack of skills. Meetings are still perceived as the most efficient channel for distributing and receiving project tasks, but they are closely followed by communication software. Applying the authors' findings to the project management practice can lead to better communication and shared document storage management, which can influence overall effectiveness of project management.

Firms sponsoring OSS projects may face substantial challenges in soliciting such contributions, since volunteer participants are neither regulated by an employment contract nor offered financial incentives. Although prior work has shown the positive impact of motivation on the effort expended by volunteer participants, there is limited understanding of how specific firm attributes shape volunteers' intrinsic motivation. We offer a theoretical model of how the perceived community-based credibility and openness of the sponsoring firm have a positive impact on the intrinsic motivation of volunteer participants. The model is explored using survey data on volunteer participants from two sponsored OSS projects. Results show that a sponsoring firm's community-based credibility OSS developers' perception of its expertise and trustworthiness and openness its mutual knowledge exchange with the community strengthen the volunteer participants' social identification with the firm-sponsored community, which in turn reinforces their intrinsic motivation to participate. Moreover, the perceived community-based credibility of a sponsoring firm directly enhances volunteer participants' intrinsic motivation, whereas perceived openness fails to affect motivation without the mediating mechanism of social identification. Implications for firms seeking voluntary contributions for their sponsored OSS projects are discussed.	open-source software	Sebastian Spaeth;Georg von Krogh;Fang He	2015	Information Systems Research	10.1287/isre.2014.0539	public relations;motivation;knowledge management;marketing;management;social psychology	SE	-86.79130657057341	-2.1502239923156283	171463

The influence of industrial sector to which a firm belongs and the combined application of these politics are also considered. These hypotheses are tested with a survey of 670 innovations developed by the Spanish firms.

This paper reports an initial empirical study to investigate the relationship between agile work artefacts and communication  during stand-up meetings and pair programming sessions, specifically focusing on gathering and clarifying requirements. Using  Bateson’s communication theory, we found that the work artefacts, and other individuals form an external event system which  supports Agile teams during the gathering and clarifying of requirements. Using this communication theory together with Clancey’s  situated cognition, we predict that if the two do not exist together throughout the interactions, then teams members will  form discoordinated actions together.

We explain this as an outcome resulted from decentralized knowledge contributions from individuals who maximize their own utilities. Our model sheds insights on how knowledge creation, knowledge citation, and knowledge heterogeneity affect the emergence of knowledge core, in both cases of direct and indirect citations. We find through simulations that the core-periphery architecture of citation networks is robust to generalizations on knowledge heterogeneity and knowledge creativity. By studying the incentive rationale that underlies the growth of citation networks, our research has potential implications on the design and administration of intellectual communities.	citation analysis;citation graph;core-periphery structure;design rationale;emergence;simulation	Yonghui Zhang;Chi Zhang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering	10.1109/TKDE.2015.2454512	nickel;database index;computer science;knowledge management;knowledge engineering;data mining;management science;citation analysis;world wide web;complex network;robustness	DB	-88.04500613274281	1.439256322356102	174731

Greater task variability in Perrow's technology grid was associated with the use of a greater variety of computing tools. Task analyzability was related to the type of computer application used. Where tasks were less analyzable, users opted for personal computers, mostly for analysis and inquiry applications. For more analyzable tasks, mainframe computers were used more extensively, mostly for exception and monitoring applications. Implications are drawn for future research on the use of computer technology.		Jawaid A.

ba105eb3bae1fc0466bf0a14d7a7ccfcfc03d2cf	understanding user adaptation toward a new it system in organizations: a social network perspective		Social networks can be a vital mechanism for users to adapt to changes induced by new IT systems in organizations. However, we do not adequately understand the effect of social networks on post-adoption IT use. Drawing on coping theory and the social network literature, we develop a cognitive-affective-behavioral classification of user adaptation and identify seeking-network closure and giving-network closure as key network characteristics pertinent to postadoption IT use. Thereafter, we establish a theoretical link from seeking-network closure and giving-network closure to post-adoption IT use through the underlying mechanisms of user adaptation. We operationalize the research model using a field survey of a newly implemented electronic medical record system in a hospital in Northeast China, where we collected network data and objective system logs of 104 doctors. We found that seeking-network closure was positively associated with cognitive adaptation but negatively associated with affective adaptation and behavioral adaptation, whereas giving-network closure was negatively associated with cognitive adaptation but positively associated with affective adaptation and behavioral adaptation. Moreover, cognitive adaptation and affective adaptation were determinants of post-adoption IT use, but behavioral adaptation was not. We discuss our study’s theoretical and practical contributions.

Informed by related arguments, we present two hypotheses that are tested using a between subjects experimental design. The first hypothesis concerns the accuracy of software process elicitation, which we characterize as the human perception of error between description and performance of a process. The second hypothesis explores the detection of subtle differences in process articulation using latent semantic analysis, a computational technique for measuring patterns in written discourse. The results of our analyses are compared along with discussion of theoretical implications. We define a new type of process property, Coherence, which represents a measure of relatedness in process knowledge. Results also indicate that Coherence may be increased with the use of a conceptual model. Future research is guided by experimental and industrial application.

The paper contains a brief description of the political and electoral system of the Weimar Republic and a characterization of the main political actors and their political views. The power distributions are evaluated by means of the Banzhaf index and two new indices which take into account the parties’ preferences to coalesce. A model is constructed to evaluate the parties’ preferences with reference to the closeness of the ideological positions in a one-dimensional political space.	weimar map	Fuad Aleskerov;Manfred J.

However, coordinating multiple group members to work together effectively while minimizing process losses remains an open challenge. We conducted an experiment comparing the effectiveness of two coordination strategies (simultaneous vs. sequential work) on a complex creative task as the number of group members increased. Our results indicate that, contrary to prior work, a sequential work structure was more effective than a simultaneous work structure as the size of the group increased. A mediation analysis suggests that social processes such as territoriality partially accounts for these results. A follow up experiment giving workers specific roles mitigated the detrimental effects of the simultaneous work structure. These results have implications for small group theory and crowdsourcing research.	crowdsourcing;interdependence;mediation (statistics)	Paul André;Robert E.

Using scientometric concepts, small group theory, organizational ecology, and process-based organizational theory, we developed a life cycle based theoretical model for analyzing long-term development of research groups and institutes. Three bibliometric indicators are proposed for growth, activity profile stability, and focus. With these, the research dynamics of the case institute are described. First, overall output growth matches developments internationally in developmental biology and stem cell research, and, in line with this, journal article output increasingly dominates the institute’s activity profile. Second, superposed on the overall growth curve, a stepwise development is observed, consisting of long phases of growth and stabilisation. These steps reflect local conditions and events. Historical sources from the Institutes’ archive and interviews with the current staff of the institute suggest that the pattern of life cycles reflects a strong influence of pioneering individuals. But once settled, pioneering directors who remain in function for many years delay adaptation of the institutes’ mission to field developments. Furthermore, national science policies on PhD training, and on priority areas have influenced the life cycles, as did merging with other institutes. As in a social science case, also in this case study stabilized local conditions lead to adaptation to research field dynamics in a delayed fashion. In the present case stable output periods lasted at most 15 years, when local impulses led to new growth of research output and thus prevented onset of a lifecycle decline. The continued growth in the larger field both promoted and legitimized these local impulses.	archive;bibliometrics;ecology;enterprise life cycle;onset (audio);quantum superposition;scientometrics;stepwise regression;theory	Robert Braam;Peter Van den Besselaar	2014	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-014-1235-5	biological life cycle;social science;computer science;organizational ecology;operations management;sociology;management;operations research;economic growth	ML	-85.38188869775529	4.146020854520037	185456
acc3938b6eee57ea33f1f5de4d9fae3c8c574b3f	continued voluntary participation intention in firm-participating open source software projects		Firm participation in open source software (OSS) development is a noteworthy phenomenon and includes two types of firm-participating OSS projects: community founded (developed from an open project) and spinout (spun out from an information technology firm’s internal project). OSS project leaders implement quality controls to improve the quality of developed products. They may not be aware that their implementation of quality controls produces a side effect—quality controls signal unobservable project quality to volunteers and promote volunteers’ continued participation intentions (VCPI). We focus on two quality controls—accreditation and code acceptance, which, respectively, map to the input and output quality of an OSS project—and compare their respective effects on VCPI in community-founded and spinout projects. We propose that accreditation and code acceptance influence VCPI by signaling unobservable input and output quality to volunteers.

In order to determine the social and organizational factors that help support a scientific team's successful transition from short-term experiments to long-term programs of ongoing scientific research, this study used observations of teams conducting experiments at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory to determine what teams actually do during these experiments. As part of a larger, ongoing research project using mixed methods, our findings describe the scientific culture of hybrid teams at work, and demonstrate how multiple, overlapping, and nested lifecycles and information worlds play an important role in promoting successful and continuing scientific collaboration. The boundaries between worlds and efforts to span them are particularly important, requiring greater attention. Our future research will develop a model including these factors and add further practical and theoretical implications to those we have already identified.	experiment	Adam Worrall;Paul F.

The nostalgia effect, whereby individuals feel satisfied or dissatisfied when thinking about past goal attainment or failure, has been observed to influence analysts' decisions with respect to ongoing systems development. The Yield Shift Theory (YST) of Satisfaction offers an explanation for the nostalgia effect as a function of changes in an individual's active goal set. This paper reports on an exploratory field investigation of nostalgia effect among 105 working IS/IT professionals in India reflecting on past collaboration experiences. The study revealed a measurable nostalgia effect, and revealed a strong association between satisfaction responses and the antecedents proposed by Yield Shift Theory.	experience;software development process	Birud Sindhav;Bruce A.

These changes can effect worker attitudes and associated behaviors, such as absenteeism and productivity. This study examines the effect of differences in key entry settings and technologies on perceived job characteristics and worker attitudes and behaviors. The results are based upon a study of 350 operators working in 87 key entry environments drawn from 29 organizations. It is found that new technologies and the movement of key entry into user areas affect perceived task characteristics, including task significance, autonomy, and feedback from the job. Job satisfaction, worker motivation, absenteeism, and productivity are also influenced (but to a lesser degree) by changes in key entry technology and setting. The implications of the findings for the design of key entry equipment and jobs are discussed. The conclusion is drawn that designers of key entry technologies and environments will benefit from a knowledge of the dimensions comprising meaningful work.		Blake Ives;Norman L.

1c6f2c07e3587825646d17fdcd67655ab30fe4b9	expectations and influencing factors of is graduates and education in thailand: a perspective of the students, academics and business community		As academic we have always been entrusted with developing the knowledge, skills, and capability of our IS students. In the strive for excellence in education, there is always the question of what has been implemented is appropriate and finally achieves its u ltimate goals of delivering qua lity, capable and intellectual students as workforce for the business. To this end, this exploratory research tries to discover what knowledge, skills and capability are expected of an IS gr aduate, the fac ilities expected to develop these qualities and what influencing factors make the students go for an IS education. The research will be based on the perspectives of the student, academic an business community. The major findings highlight the overall tendency of higher mean expectation of the business community in most of the fundamental expectations of the type of kn owledge, s ills and capability and the fac ilities essential to the development of these attributes. The academics are normally s upportive of the business community’s perspectives except in the dimensions of skill expectation nd attitudinal factors. Overall, it also appears that the students show a lower average means on most attributes as compared to the academics and business community. Based on this research, there appears to be disti nctive expectations of an IS graduate. Based on the balanced technology approach of looking at the development of the IS graduate from degree of so phistication of the Technoware (T), Humaware (H), Inforware (I) and Orgaware (O), it is hoped that the following can be achieved: 1. A newly revise d and revamped IS curriculum, 2. A linkage of the THIO to develop the IS graduate and 3. A linkage of the academia-industry THIO linkage to de velop the IS graduate.	linkage (software);non-functional requirement	Teay Shawyun	1999	InformingSciJ		engineering;knowledge management;operations management;management	Web+IR	-85.09312516625828	2.269364547843822	190618
1263963cbe40ac38c4106b4dbdab0c039e4c5a57	guiding cooperative stakeholders to compromise solutions using an interactive tradespace exploration process	compromise;utility;visual analytics;systems engineering	Engineering projects frequently involve the cooperation of multiple stakeholders with varying objectives and preferences for the resulting system. Finding a mutually agreeable solution is of paramount importance in order to assure the successful completion of these projects, particularly when different stakeholders are splitting the costs because none can afford to finance the project on their own. This paper proposes a process for uncovering potential mutually agreeable solutions between conflicting stakeholders, without relying on hypothetical aggregate or super-stakeholder preferences, by using guided individual preference compromises and efficiency tradeoffs. Opportunities for experimentally testing the process, with results investigating its usability and solution quality, are discussed. Further directions to improve and expand the process are also discussed, with attention paid to the design of the process as it relates to promoting an implied concept of “goodness” or “fairness” of compromise along with the ability of the process to incorporate advanced interactive technology to improve knowledge retention and understanding of the participating stakeholders. © 2013 The Authors.

54b953b6a1b1316c6cef062882532b2fa7e1288f	adopting collaborative games into agile requirements engineering		In agile software development, where great emphasis is put on effective informal communication involving diverse stakeholders, success depends on human and social factors. Not surprisingly, the Agile Manifesto advocates principles and values such as “individuals and interactions over processes and tools”, “focus on the customer”, “collaborate regularly”, “communicate face-to-face within the team” and “have regular team introspection”. However, agile methodologies have hardly provided any tools or techniques that aid the human side of software development. Additionally, more and more research suggests that customers no longer should be viewed as a passive source of information but need to be engaged in envisioning future business practice, discovering opportunities, and shaping solutions. To deal with these challenges, we propose a framework for extending Scrum with 9 collaborative games. Collaborative games refer to several structured techniques inspired by game play and designed to facilitate collaboration, foster customer involvement, and stimulate creative thinking. The feedback received from a Scrum team that leveraged our framework in two commercial projects, indicates that the adopted collaborative games: (1) make customers more willing to attend the meeting; (2) foster stakeholders’ commitment; and (3) produce better results than the standard approach.	agile software development;collaborative software;information source;interaction;introspection;noise shaping;requirements engineering;scrum (software development)	Adam Przybylek;Mateusz Zakrzewski	2018		10.5220/0006681900540064	manifesto;introspection;engineering management;systems engineering;computer science;software development;requirements engineering;agile software development;scrum	HCI	-88.74072193524815	0.07777826922270122	191545

We use a novel multiple input environment for collaboration and data collection, and a hidden profile task given to groups, whose goals are to find the correct solution. We observe that groups elect 0, 1 or 2 leaders, and the best results are obtained by the groups with a single leader. Prior acquaintance (familiarity), does not show any effect on the success or on the group strategies. Groups with a single leader tend to be more successful, and leaders expressed their authority verbally rather than by through the collaborative system.	focus group;problem solving	Flaviu Roman;Himanshu Verma;Patrick Jermann;Pierre Dillenbourg	2012		10.1145/2389176.2389232	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;computer-supported cooperative work;communication;management;social psychology;collaboration	ML	-87.35959979679203	-0.9942864982982782	193898

We draw on affective events theory, as well as the literature on IT personnel and leader support to explicate these relationships. We conducted a field study of 289 IT workers in a Fortune 500 company. LMX and career mentoring explained 28% of the variance in organizational commitment. Additionally, we found that the impact of career mentoring on organizational commitment is stronger for women than for men and that career mentoring influences organizational commitment for non-minority races but not minority races. Finally, the influence of LMX on organizational commitment is stronger for minority races than for non-minority races. This study contributes to the body of literature on IT personnel issues by exploring whether and how organizational support mechanisms enhance organizational commitment for private sector IT workers. We also demonstrate that race and gender are important considerations for researchers studying organizational commitment, mentoring, and LMX. Our findings suggest that managers can boost organizational commitment among IT workers by focusing on LMX and career mentoring. Moreover, they may want to place particular emphasis on career mentoring programs for women and on the development of supervisor/employee relationships for their minority race IT workers.	field research	Jaime B.

However, few empirical studies of cognitive style have been conducted in the discipline of negotiation systems (NS). To draw the attention of NS researchers, this study applied Foxall's style/involvement model (SIM) to reveal the relationship between users' unique cognitive styles and their ENS future use intentions. The theoretical model was tested using empirical data collected from an online laboratory experiment involving 92 subjects. Findings confirmed that underlying differences in individuals' adaptive- innovative styles and involvement levels were associated with significant differences in their future use intention towards ENSs. More specifically, more- involved innovators reported the highest future use intention towards ENSs among the four segments. This study not only extends the IS research stream of cognitive style in the context of ENS, but also broadens the knowledge of cognitive styles in the context of information systems by introducing a SIM that has been well examined in the disciplines of social psychology and marketing.	information system;theory	Hersen Doong;Hui-Chih Wang	2008	Proceedings of the 41st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2008)	10.1109/HICSS.2008.439	cognition;cognitive style;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;marketing;management science;empirical research;management;information system;statistics;data collection	HCI	-85.81182646318891	0.13538375819727835	196943

Groupware is widely touted as the information technology that can support this new mode of work by fostering collaboration. In a study of Lotus Notes, a popular groupware product, implemented throughout the professional staff of a large American insurance company, we found the impact of groupware to be somewhat different from what many might have expected. While almost everyone was quite pleased with the Notes implementation and its perceived impact, there was no evidence of a change in the degree of collaboration among organization members. Two key themes are explored as possible explanations for this result: the fit of the technology to the organization, and limited training in how best to use this new technology.	ibm notes	Betty Vandenbosch;Michael J.
