In this paper, we optimize traffic grooming for static traffic in mesh Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks with wavelength converters. The optimization objective is to maximize network profit, which is the difference between resource cost and the revenue generated (by selecting profitable traffic flows). A constrained integer linear programming formulation is given, and a decomposition using Lagrangian relaxation is proposed. We then present a systematic approach to solve this problem and to obtain a performance bound for an arbitrary topology mesh network. Our approach can select traffic flows based on their profit, while obtaining their data path routing, lightpath routing and wavelength assignment at the same time. Our performance evaluation also reveals the impact of various cost parameters on the profit objective.	integer programming;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming formulation;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;network topology;performance evaluation;routing and wavelength assignment;wavelength-division multiplexing	James Yiming Zhang;Jing Wu;Oliver W.

This behaviour results in various types of race conditions in accord with various packet and message orderings. Increased forwarding delay of data packets, increased complexity in performing software verification, and increased load on switch and controller processors are the ill effects of these races.	central processing unit;network packet;openflow;race condition;software verification	Xiaoye Sun;Apoorv Agarwal;T.

9ba350e7c308f099a503cbd1635dab9c8c7e3303	energy-efficient traffic engineering for future core networks		Introduction: Traffic engineering (TE) plays a crucial role in determining the performance and reliability of network deployments. A major challenge in traffic engineering is how to cope with dynamic and unpredictable changes in traffic demands and how the network could handle possible traffic variations in a way that load balancing, congestion avoidance and efficient service provisioning are ensured. A more straightforward explanation of TE is given in [1]: “to put the traffic where the network bandwidth is available”. The rapid growing of the users and the services that must be supported, the spreading of broadband access in conjunction with the increased energy prices affected the demand for energy-aware service provisioning. A challenging task is to identify the main parts of the Internet that dominate its power consumption and investigate methods for improving energy consumption [2]. The first attempt to introduce energy savings in the Internet was made in [3]. The authors in [4] discuss the idea of dynamically turning part of the network operations into sleeping mode, during light utilization periods, in order to minimize the energy consumption. The authors in [5] identified the power saving problem in the Internet, and propose sleeping as the approach to conserve energy. Moreover, routing, rate adaptation and network control are mobilized towards energy-efficient network operation [6]. Unfortunately, none of these approaches provide a problem formulation in the direction of jointly studying the “traditional” objectives and the new objectives (energy-awareness) of TE. This work is an attempt to put these objectives under a joint problem formulation and to propose lightweight solutions that could be applied in real network deployments. We provide a joint problem formulation for optimal energy-aware load balancing in the network. Then, we propose a distributed ENergyEfficient TRaffic Engineering (ENTRE) scheme that smoothly introduces the aforementioned major issues in real deployments.	internet access;load balancing (computing);network congestion;provisioning;routing;smoothing;test engineer	George Athanasiou	2012	CoRR		simulation;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-11.321169464338945	83.85723611042762	193213

Since reliability is such a critical issue in these broadband networks, we propose an integrated design method which addresses the problem of survivability as viewed from the IP/MPLS layers but taking into account the failure mechanisms in the optical layer. This approach is becoming practical because of the emergence of generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) as a multilayer control plane that can support the signaling required for coordinating the restoration mechanisms in multiple layers. The model relies on network calculus to evaluate a quality of service (QoS) metric as actually perceived by end users and computes a preplanned restoration scheme to recover from failures. We discuss the numerical implementation, the convergence and the solutions produced by the algorithm and show that the resulting network can provide the prescribed QoS guarantees for all failure states.	algorithm;backup;blocking (computing);circuit restoration;control plane;egress filtering;elegant degradation;emergence;end-to-end principle;erlang (unit);failure cause;generalized multi-protocol label switching;internet backbone;multiprotocol label switching;network calculus;network congestion;network performance;network planning and design;network topology;network traffic control;numerical analysis;quality of service;routing;virtual private network;wavelength-division multiplexing	Florent Mobiot;Brunilde Sansò;André Girard	2005	Journal of Network and Systems Management	10.1007/s10922-005-1862-5	internet protocol;telecommunications;computer science;optical ip switching;distributed computing;computer network;broadband networks	Networks	-9.241493038410015	84.92777686491866	193455

The architecture is based on the adaptive highest random weight (Adaptive HRW) algorithm proposed to design load balanced Internet routers. To reduce flow remapping, the architecture extends the adaptive HRW algorithm with a minimal flow remapping selection scheme that identifies the traffic causing imbalance in the network and needs to be rerouted, where rerouting is implemented by adapting the weight vectors associated with the traffic. Compared to the adaptive HRW method, the selection scheme further reduces flow remapping and the effect of packets reordering. The architecture is stateless and can compute routes quickly based on the packet flow identifier. This is important when deploying the VLB network as a backbone network where the number of flows is large and storing flow state information in lookup tables could limit the network performance.	algorithm;identifier;internet backbone;linear programming formulation;lookup table;mesh networking;network packet;network performance;routing;simulation;stateless protocol;traffic flow (computer networking);vesa local bus	Imad Khazali;Anjali Agarwal	2012	2012 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2012.6249383	the internet;resource allocation;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-6.779077013659307	82.84839089601448	193633

We argue that the solution is to redesign the Internet by gradually replacing IP with a carrier grade transport system. In practice such a packet transport system can be created based on Carrier Grade Ethernet. We call the resulting network Internet by Ethernet.

Recently, there has been a significant interest in a novel paradigm of network coding. Network coding generalizes the traditional routing approach by allowing the network nodes to generate new packets by performing algebraic operations on packets received over the incoming links. It has been shown that network coding can increase the throughput of multicast communication. In this paper, we explore the benefits of network coding for improving the routing characteristics of VLSI designs. We demonstrate that when data has to be routed across the IC, it is often beneficial to perform network coding. Initial results demonstrate that network coding can result in a healthy reduction in wire length, wire area, interconnect power as well as the active area associated with the interconnects.

This paper provides an extensive resource, serving the motivation for MPLS and traffic engineering. General issues such as setting up the Label switching paths, Label substitution and retention schemes are addressed in the first part of the paper. The core value of MPLS is then described followed by a brief comparison of two MPLS protocols: RSVP (Resource reservation protocol) and CR LDP (constraint based routing Label distribution protocol) dealing with integration of MPLS with Quality of Service.

9ae052d45a425ed5f900a1b387b74cd2ba6e69cb	scari: a strategic caching and reservation protocol for icn		In the last decade, the Internet service model has shifted from sharing resources to distributing content. Certain applications such as large science data, CDNs, VoIP and multimedia applications transfer a significant amount of data over the Internet in a time-constrained manner that requires guaranteed in-network resources. The networking community often achieves this by creating point-to-point guaranteed bandwidth paths. However, the current resource reservation solutions are end-to-end and often initiated by users without the knowledge of the underlying network conditions. As a result, the data flowing through these reserved tunnels are not reusable, and in-network resources are not optimally utilized.  On the contrary, Information-Centric Networking architectures such as NDN[16] has several properties that can facilitate resource reservations more intelligently. In this work, we present Strategic Caching And Reservation in ICN (SCARI), a protocol for reserving resources on ICN networks. Similar to RSVP[17] in IP networks, SCARI acts as a signaling mechanism before the actual data transfer. In this work, we focus explicitly on scientific dataflows and not on other types of traffic such as real-time audio/video. We show that SCARI reduces network resource consumption by aggregating reservations and strategically caching content in the network.	acknowledgement (data networks);architecture as topic;audio media;behavior;cache;clients;communications protocol;deploy;downstream (software development);end-to-end principle;feeding behaviors;flow;icn gps;inter-domain;internet protocol suite;multimedia;ndn gene;node - plant part;point-to-point protocol;real-time clock;routing;software deployment	Susmit Shannigrahi	2018		10.1145/3289166.3289167	computer science;computer network;distributed computing;reservation;information-centric networking;bandwidth (signal processing);resource (disambiguation)	Networks	-8.822278669544977	88.51313347987427	196323

In our approach, multiple DIN Nodes in the core network form the DINloop using MPLS so that multiple multicast sessions share a single DINloop. We adopts a label stack method to use fewer labels and label switch paths (LSPs) are established between DIN Nodes to create the DINloop. Packet processing module analyzes the coming multicast packet and MPLS Manager assigns a label stack to it. Simulations show that DINloop based multicast uses the least message load needed to form the multicast architecture. In addition, the routing table size in the core router does not increase as the number of multicast group increases, and therefore DINloop based multicast increases the routing scalability for inter-domain multicast. Finally, the multicast delay in DINloop based multicast is moderate lager than other protocols.	core router;inter-domain;multicast;multiprotocol label switching;network packet;router (computing);routing table;scalability	H.

However, it degrades the efficiency of network utilization. Spare bandwidth demand can be reduced significantly by letting spare bandwidth be shared among several network services. Spare bandwidth reserved on a network element can be shared by a set of network services for a network fault if they are not simultaneously affected by the network fault. A new, and more practical spare bandwidth sharing scheme, which is based on the network reliability, is proposed in this paper. In the proposed scheme, multiple link failures are allowed with a given link failure rate, and a reasonable restoration level of near 100%; while in the conventional scheme, only a single link failure, and 100% restoration level are considered. To develop the spare bandwidth sharing scheme, we first investigate the framework for evaluating the reliability of path-based network services, and then we explain the proposed spare bandwidth sharing scheme with decision parameters such as lifetime of the path, restoration level, and the maximum number of working paths which can be protected by a backup link. Simulation results show that the proposed spare bandwidth sharing scheme requires a smaller amount of spare bandwidth than the conventional scheme.	backup;circuit restoration;failure rate;simulation	Kyu-Seek Sohn;Seung Yeob Nam;Dan Keun Sung	2005	IEEE Transactions on Reliability	10.1109/TR.2004.842532	multiprotocol label switching;reliability engineering;communications protocol;failure analysis;bandwidth management;fault tolerance;network traffic control;the internet;degradation;amplitude modulation;engineering;probability;distributed computing;reliability;bandwidth;statistics;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Networks	-7.702047180505107	82.7584397434835	197461

However, it is difficult to adjust the path of the generated multicast spanning tree (MST) if the multicast source and group members are unchanged. OpenFlow has been a key technology to realize the software defined networking and makes the flow control feasible. This paper presents an OpenFlow-based solution to dynamically adjust the path of MST by configuring the paths according to the requirements of the network loads and specific conditions. In addition, we propose a distributed MST strategy to satisfy the requirements of inter-domain multicast transmissions. Experimental results show that the proposed solution can effectively adjust the paths of MST and facilitate the generation of MST by parallel computation in the construction of distributed MST.	algorithm;computation;file spanning;inter-domain;multicast;openflow;parallel computing;requirement;software-defined networking;spanning tree	Jingguo Ge;Hanji Shen;E Yuepeng;Yulei Wu;Junling You	2013	2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2013.179	real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;xcast;computer network;multicast address	HPC	-6.916066322048061	82.31945564699383	197629

Compared to its single radio counterpart for which solutions exist, this problem is significantly more complex because it requires the radio channel assignments and the traffic allocations per channel be jointly optimized. We address the problem by introducing a formulation that allows its decomposition in two subproblems: A congestion control subproblem for traffic allocation to a fixed channel assignment over a node path and a discrete combinatorial channel assignment subproblem. We solve the conditional congestion control subproblem by mapping it to an optimization problem of traffic distribution to a set of radio paths. The solution provides channel congestion information that is utilized to address the channel assignment subproblem. This leads to an iterative procedure which guarantees successive increases to overall network utilization. Compared to existing work on multi- radio, multi-channel mesh networks, we show that our approach can yield significant gains both in terms of network utilization and establishing fairness.	fairness measure;iterative method;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;network congestion;optimization problem;wireless mesh network	Anastasios Giannoulis;Theodoros Salonidis;Edward W.
