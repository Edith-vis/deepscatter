This approach is illustrated with the plurality vote by characterizing all possible profiles which cause all possible conflicts between the plurality and other pairwise and/or positional procedures. The approach then is used to cast doubt on an often-cited plurality vote property.		Donald G. Saari	2002	Math. Oper.

In line with theoretical predictions, we nd that majority rule with veto power dominates unanimity rule. We also nd that the strategic voting model is a fairly good predictor of subject behavior. Finally, we exploit a framing e¤ect to study how the presence of less sophisticated agents a¤ects Vetos welfare properties.

Firstly, we present a coordination algorithm, which ensures the agent places appropriate bids in the different auctions to buy exactly the right number of goods. Secondly, we combine this with an algorithm to determine what maximum bid an agent should place in an auction that is about to terminate. This algorithm combines a belief-based model of the auctions with a utility analysis. This analysis is to trade off the certain outcome of the terminating auction against the possible outcomes of the remaining auctions, and hence to place appropriate bids in each.	algorithm design;divergence (computer science);forward error correction;refinement (computing);terminate (software)	Chris Preist;Claudio Bartolini;Ivan Phillips	2000		10.1007/3-540-44723-7_10	algorithm design;combinatorial auction;bidding;unique bid auction;computer science;common value auction;english auction;algorithm;forward auction	ECom	-6.219226085334977	-5.1204995405871205	196283

One recently proposed mechanism for curbing the harm by misbehaving nodes is that of an introduction-based reputation protocol [1]: transactions are permitted only between two nodes who (i) consent to being connected through introduction via a third node and (ii) provide binary-valued feedback about one another to that introducer when the connection closes. This paper models probabilistically the decision processes by which this feedback is both generated and interpreted-the associated reputation management algorithms account for different modes of misbehavior, respect the inherent information decentralization and are consistent with the utility-maximizing decisions established previously for other parts of the protocol.	algorithm;binary data;node (computer science);reputation management	Patrick Caldwell;O.

22d6afaaa5055a25de7ced24936ef21e0a24ae49	bounty hunters and multiagent task allocation	bounty hunting;task allocation;auctions	We propose a system for multiagent task allocation inspired by the model used by bounty hunters and bail bondsmen. A bondsman posts tasks for agents to complete, along with bounties to be collected by an agent on completion. Multiple agents, taking the role of the bounty hunters, compete to finish tasks and collect their bounties. While a task remains uncompleted, its bounty gradually rises, making it more and more desirable to pursue. Unlike auctions, this model does not assume rationality in agents’ bids (as there are none), and since tasks are not exclusive to given agents, the system is robust to highly noisy environments. We examine how agents may locally develop rational task valuations in such an environment, gradually adapting to dividing tasks according to the agents best suited to them. We compare different methods for building these valuations against approaches which are more “auction-like” in that they permit exclusivity, and we do so under both static environments and ones in which agents, and task details, change dynamically.	agent-based model;augmented assignment;experiment;image noise;logical equality;rationality	Drew Wicke;David Freelan;Sean Luke	2015			simulation;artificial intelligence;common value auction	AI	-9.945814318967638	-5.832061189361755	199614

In the mechanism, each participating agent generates many instances of itself to help it find an appropriate strategy. The generated instances adopt alternative strategies from the agent's strategy set. While all instances generated by different agents meet randomly to complete a task, every instance adapts its strategy according to the difference between the average utilities of its current strategy and all its strategies. We give a complete analysis of the mechanism for the case with two agents when each agent has two strategies, and show that by the tenet of Darwinism, agents can find their appropriate strategies through evolution and adaptation: 1) if dominant strategies exist, then the proposed mechanism is guaranteed to find them; 2) if there are two or more strict Nash equilibrium strategies, the proposed mechanism is guaranteed to find them by using different initial strategy distributions; and 3) if there is no dominant strategy and no strict Nash equilibrium, then agents will oscillate periodically. Nevertheless, the mechanism allows agent designers to derive the appropriate strategies from the oscillation by integration. For cases with two agents when each agent has two or more strategies, it is shown that agents can reach a steady state where social welfare is optimum.	fixed point (mathematics);intelligent agent;interaction;nash equilibrium;population;randomness;simulation;steady state	Kwang Mong Sim;Yuanshi Wang	2005	IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation	10.1109/TEVC.2005.856204	mathematical optimization;simulation;coevolution;computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;social welfare;mathematical economics;steady state;oscillation;nash equilibrium	AI	-9.756778665016148	-7.403282085526339	199677
