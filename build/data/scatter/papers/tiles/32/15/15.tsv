By relaxing the assumptions in Weber [41], we show that these risk measures can be identified with a class of generalised shortfall risk measures. As a direct consequence, we are able to extend the results in Ziegel [42] and Bellini and Bignozzi [7] on convex elicitable risk measures and confirm that expectiles are the only elicitable coherent risk measures. Further, we provide a simple characterisation of robustness for convex risk measures in terms of a weak notion of mixture continuity.	coherence (physics);risk measure;scott continuity	Freddy Delbaen;Fabio Bellini;Valeria Bignozzi;Johanna Fasciati-Ziegel	2016	Finance and Stochastics	10.1007/s00780-015-0279-6	financial economics;mathematical optimization;economics;decision theory;mathematics;mathematical economics;welfare economics;time consistency;statistics;robustness	ML	-7.594703844707398	-0.5552787371062837	194751
96f8f1d3f1f21f91d3b090985c6056f023aa6693	optimization implementation and characterization of the equal allocation of nonseparable costs value		This paper devotes to the study of the equal allocation of nonseparable costs value for cooperative games. On the one hand, we show that the equal allocation of nonseparable costs value is the unique optimal solution that minimizes the total complaints for individual players over the pre-imputation set. On the other hand, analogously to the way of determining the Nucleolus, we obtain the equal allocation of nonseparable costs value by applying the lexicographic order over the individual complaints. Moreover, we offer alternative characterizations of the equal allocation of nonseparable costs value by proposing several new properties such as dual nullifying player property, dual dummifying player property and grand marginal contribution monotonicity.	emoticon;geo-imputation;lexicographical order;lexicography;marginal model;mathematical optimization;maximal set;optimization problem	Panfei Sun;Dongshuang Hou;Hao Sun;Theo S.

We address two fundamental questions: how can we represent a game? and how can we represent a game with polynomial pay-off functions? Our results show that the computational complexity of deciding the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium in a strategic game depends on two parameters: the number of players and the size of the sets of strategies. In particular we show that deciding the existence of a Nash equilibrium in a strategic game is NP-complete when the number of players is large and the number of strategies for each player is constant, while the problem is Σ$^{p}_{\rm 2}$-complete when the number of players is a constant and the size of the sets of strategies is exponential (with respect to the length of the strategies).	nash equilibrium	Carme Àlvarez;Joaquim Gabarró;Maria J.

24f60ce14741a79768a774f78f81fa3d8a8ed248	manipulation and bribery in preference reasoning under pareto principle		Manipulation and bribery have received much attention from the social choice community. We consider these concepts in the setting of preference formalisms, where the Pareto principle is used to assign to preference theories collections of optimal outcomes, rather than a single winning outcome as is common in social choice. We adapt the concepts of manipulation and bribery to this setting. We provide characterizations of situations when manipulation and bribery are possible. Assuming a particular logical formalism for expressing preferences, we establish the complexity of determining a possibility for manipulation or bribery. In all cases that do not in principle preclude a possibility of manipulation or bribery, our complexity results show that deciding whether manipulation or bribery are actually possible is computationally hard.	computational complexity theory;decision problem;formal system;graph coloring;human body weight;lambda lifting;lift table;lifting scheme;logic programming;mathematical optimization;pareto efficiency;preference learning;regular expression	Ying Zhu;Miroslaw Truszczynski	2014			computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;welfare economics;pareto principle;social choice theory;formalism (philosophy);as is	AI	-8.494721469439718	2.588610704304262	197814
67a03a5428fe98db0794aacfd605acac11f031a1	on the relations between the value of a game and its information structure	information structure	In deterministic zero-sum two-person games, the upper and lower values move towards each other as the information available to the players is increased. This basic fact still holds, with appropriate interpretation, even when the closed loop equations fail to have a unique solution for all pairs of strategies, a hypothesis that would at times be overly restrictive.  In particular, if a saddle-point exists for some information pattern, then it remains a saddle-point when the information available is increased. In that case, the additional information can only enable a player to come closer to the ideal of permanent optimality.  These results, though, fail to hold in an essential way when the game is stochastic.		Hans S.

5c46c1513ec1e15df1cd25bad63a626d85ec44f0	z-equilibrium for a csp game		Constraint programming and game theory are two active research domains providing a powerful framework for modeling and solving several important applications in computer science, artificial intelligence and decision aiding in general. However, only little attention has been paid to their possible connexions and relationships. In this paper, we first prove the equivalence between the concept of solution of a constraint satisfaction problem and the Z-equilibrium of its associated game. Then, we propose a backtrack search based procedure for computing such equilibrium. Introduction Constraint programming (CP) is a flexible programming paradigm in which problems are specified declaratively as constraints between variables and a general search procedure is responsible for finding a valuation of the variables satisfying the constraints. Constraint Programming draws on a wide range of methods from artificial intelligence, computer science, databases, logic programming and operations research. It has been successfully applied in a number of fields such as scheduling, configuration, computational biology and vehicle routing. On the other hand, game theory is a branch of mathematics devoted to studying interactions among rational agents. It can be used as framework for modeling and solving a variety of problems encountered in several application domains such as economy, transportation and logistics, telecommunications and biology. The rise of distributed/parallel computing made game theory increasingly necessary for computer scientists to study settings in which intelligent agents reason and interact with other agents. One can cite, distributed constraint satisfaction problems where the problem is modeled as a constraint network in which variables and constraints are distributed among multiple agents (Yokoo et al. 1992). Various applications of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) can be formalized as distributed CSPs (Béjar et al. 2005; Yokoo and Hirayama 2000). In this dynamic, there are some innovative work establishing relationships between game theory and constraint satisfaction problems (CSP). Indeed, (Ricci 1991) proposed a representation of a CSP as a noncooperative game with n players. He proved that each solution of a given CSP is also a Nash equilibrium of the associated game. Furthermore, when the CSP is consistent, the set of solutions of the CSP coincides with the set of admissible Nash equilibria of the game. Another possible modeling can be obtained by representing CSPs as cooperative games (Bistarelli and Gosti 2009), aiming to solve a distributed CSP via naming game. Furthermore, in (Kolaitis and Vardi 2000), the authors proved that the main consistency concepts used to derive tractability results for CSPs are intimately related to certain combinatorial pebble games, called the existential k-pebble games. More precisely, they particularly show that strong k-consistency is equivalent to a condition on winning strategies for the duplicator player in the existential k-pebble game. We can also represent a game as a constraint satisfaction problem solving. Bordeaux and Pajot adopted this approach for computing Nash equilibrium (Bordeaux and Pajot 2005). For the same purpose, simple backtrack search methods have been adopted in (Porter, Nudelman, and Shoham 2008). In (Vickrey and Koller 2002; Soni, Singh, and Wellman 2007), efficient algorithms based on constraint satisfaction were proposed for computing approximate Nash equilibria for arbitrary one-shot graphical games. A similar approche was also proposed in (Soni, Singh, and Wellman 2007) for solving repeated graphical games. In (Apt, Rossi, and Venable 2008), the authors have compared the notions of optimality in strategic game and soft constraints. It is important to note that most of the contributions in this domain focused on Nash equilibrium, a fundamental concept in game theory (Jiang 2007; Porter, Nudelman, and Shoham 2008; Bordeaux and Pajot 2005). In this paper, we deal with another related concept called Z-equilibrium, and we prove its equivalence with a solution of its associated CSP. As no algorithm exists in the literature allowing us to compute Z-equilibrium, we exploit this theoretical results to propose a backtrack search procedure for computing a Z-equilibrium of the CSP game. Preliminary definitions and notations The class of problems that constraint programming systems focus on are constraint satisfaction problems. A Constraint Network (CN) P is a pair (X , C) where X is a finite set of n variables and C a finite set of e constraints. Each variable X ∈ X has an associated domain, denoted DX , which contains the set of values allowed for X . Each constraint C ∈ C involves an ordered subset of variables of X , called scope and denoted scp(C), and has an associated relation, denoted RC , which contains the set of tuples allowed for its variables. The arity of the constraint C is given by kC = |scp(C)|. A solution to a CN is the assignment of a value to each variable such that all the constraints are satisfied. A CN is said to be satisfiable (or consistent) iff it admits at least one solution. Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) consists in determining whether a given CN is satisfiable or not. A CSP instance is then defined by a CN, and solving it involves either finding one solution or proving its unsatisfiability. Representing a CSP as a Game Solving a CSP may be reduced to the problem of finding an equilibrium in a game (Ricci 1991; Bistarelli and Gosti 2009; Kolaitis and Vardi 2000; Apt, Rossi, and Venable 2008). Let us consider a constraint network P = (X , C) and its associated game G(P) (Ricci 1991): G(P) = < I, {Si}i∈I , {Ui}i∈I >, (1) ◦ Each variable Xi ∈ X is associated to a player i. We note by I = {1, . . . , n} the set of players involved in the game G(P). There is a one to one mapping between the set of variables X and the set of players I . ◦ Si = DXi is the set of pure strategies associated to the player i ∈ I i.e. there is a one to one mapping between the values of the domain of the variable Xi and the pure strategies of the player i. ◦ The utility function of the player i ∈ I is given by Ui(s1, . . . , sn) = ∑ Cj∈C(Xi) kCj × χCj (sj1 , . . . , jkCj ) (2) where s = (s1, . . . , sn) ∈ S = ∏n i=1 Si is a complete instantiation of the n variables of the CSP P corresponding to a game issue (situation) of G(P) and C(Xi) defines the set of constraints involving the variable Xi. For a constraint Cj ∈ C(Xi) with scp(Cj) = {Xj1 , . . . , jkCj } and a game issue s, we note (sj1 , . . . , jkCj ) the projection of s on the players {j1, . . . , jkCj } ⊆ I . We define, χCj (sj1 , . . . , jkCj ) = { 1, if (sj1 , . . . , jkCj ) ∈ RCj , 0, otherwise. The utility or payoff function of a player i ∈ I measures the degree of satisfaction of the constraints involving Xi. The payoff represents the number of constraints involving Xi that the game issue satisfies, weighted by the arity of the constraints. As mentioned in (Ricci 1991), to express the relevance or the hierarchy of the constraints, one could associate a different weight for every constraint. Other weighting schemes can also be defined by associating different weights on variables or players. In the sequel, we heavily use the following notations and definitions: 1. si ∈ Si: the strategy chosen by a player i ∈ I; 2. s−i: a combination of strategies chosen by the opponents of a player i ∈ I; 3. s = (si, s−i): an issue (situation) of the game;	approximation algorithm;backtrack;backtracking;computational biology;computer science;computer scientist;constraint (mathematics);constraint programming;constraint satisfaction problem;cryptographic service provider;database;directx plugin;distributed artificial intelligence;game theory;graphical user interface;intelligent agent;interaction;local consistency;logic programming;logistics;mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints;nash equilibrium;operations research;parallel computing;pebble game;problem solving;programming paradigm;rational agent;relevance;scheduling (computing);turing completeness;universal instantiation;utility;value (ethics);vehicle routing problem	Kahina Bouchama;Mohammed Said Radjef;Lakhdar Sais	2016				AI	-6.96472996682708	2.1725079914447565	199338

Also, the justification of the preference order formalism begins with the concept of utility i.e. an alternative is preferred to another one if the utility over the first is higher then the utility over the second. In this paper is proposed an ideal model of measuring utilities by considering individuals and alternatives no more as atomic concepts but as being composed by other entities. 1 Basic definitions Individuals, along their existence, tries to reach a series of objectives that, according to them, ensure a satisfiable individual welfare. When an individual judges over an alternative considers his own objectives and observes the possibility that this particular alternative will allow him to reach these objectives. Definition 1 Given a society V = {V1, V2, ..., VN} and an environment A = {A1, A2, ..., AM}, we define the universe of the objectives, the set: Γ = {γ1, γ2, ..., γR} as the set of all the required objectives by the individuals in I and the objectives offered by the alternatives in A. For each alternative Am ∈ A we can put in evidence the set of the offered objectives, that for simplicity we will give it the same name as the alternative itself: Am = {α m 1 , α m 2 , ..., α m H} where αmh ∈ Γ for all h = 1, ..., H . Similarly, each individual Vn ∈ V is characterised by the set of the required objectives: Vn = {ν n 1 , ν n 2 , ..., ν n K} where ν k ∈ Γ for all k = 1, ..., K. Considering the universe Γ as a-priori entity, we can treat a given alternative or individual as an element of ℘(Γ) The set of all the alternatives 1 ℘(Γ) is the set of all subsets of Γ	entity;semantics (computer science);set theory;utility	Redjan F.

In its simplest form, the two-person MSG is shown to have a price of anarchy (PoA) which is bounded by 0.5. The PoA bound provides a measure on the efficiency of the worst Nash Equilibrium in social (or global) terms. The approach taken by the present paper introduces the Cost of Cooperation (CoC) for games. The CoC is defined with respect to different global objective functions and provides a measure on the efficiency of a solution for each participant (personal). Applying an “egalitarian” objective, that maximizes the minimal gain among all participating agents, on our simple example results in a CoC which is non positive for all agents. This makes the MSG a cooperation game. The concepts are defined and examples are given within the context of the MSG. Although not all games are cooperation games, a game may be revised by adding a mediator (or with a slight change of its mechanism) so that it behaves as a cooperation game. Rational participants can cooperate (by taking part in a distributed optimization protocol) and receive a payoff which will be at least as high as the worst gain expected by a game theoretic equilibrium point.	anarchy;matchware mediator;mathematical optimization;scheduling (computing);software agent;theory	Alon Grubshtein;Amnon Meisels	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03214-1_24	price of stability;epsilon-equilibrium;mathematical optimization;best response;economics;subgame;microeconomics;mathematical economics;subgame perfect equilibrium;price of anarchy;nash equilibrium	ECom	-4.79317504247631	0.3113926466631634	199971
