Existing proposals, for example, UPnP, MIDCOM, TURN, STUN, STUNT, P2PNAT, NATBlaster among others, offer only partial, limited and non-deterministic solutions. A framework that offers a complete solution to the P2P communication problem is presented. The proposed framework is based on the use of IPv4Ã¾4 addresses and the standard IPv4 Loose Source Record Route (LSRR) option and requires no changes whatsoever to end-host protocol stacks and Internet routers. The only requirement is a simple upgrade of border routers with a new LSRR-based packet-forwarding algorithm for the P2P traffic. The implementation of a Linux-based border router that runs the proposed forwarding algorithm is detailed, and how P2P applications can benefit from this framework is described.	algorithm;linux;network address translation;network packet;peer-to-peer;realms;router (computing);universal plug and play	Cihan Topal;Cuneyt Akinlar	2009	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2008.0364	internet protocol;shared resource;communications protocol;routing;the internet;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;network address translation;deterministic system;implementation;computer security;packet switching;computer network	Networks	-5.335346422663176	76.23381290420751	191877
97c32bbb81806fc90077ede32716c2413a19ae59	comparative analysis of sdn and conventional networks using routing protocols		Conventional routing protocols such as RIP, OSPF, EIGRP and BGP have a very rigid and intricate system thus narrowing the adaptability of networks to the ever changing Internet. The emergence of Software Defined Networking (SDN) provides a solution for this problem. Due to the handiness of a centralized controller, SDN has provided an effective method in terms of routing computation and fine control over data packets. Due to the increase in unpredicted failures taking place the ability to predict/know the approximate maximum time it takes for these networks to converge in order to avoid and/or minimize loss of packets/data during these failures has become crucial in today's world. This time that the routers in the network take to converge via the implemented routing protocol and resume communication or transfer of information is called the routing convergence time. In this work, the performance is measured using routing convergence time during link failure with respect to the topology scale to show that SDN routing/forwarding is better compared to conventional routing. Further the results indicate that the routing convergence time is less in SDN networks on comparison with conventional networks when the topology scale is increased, indicating that SDN networks converge faster in comparison with Conventional networks and that routing convergence time is greatly influenced with the changing topological size.	approximation algorithm;border gateway protocol;centralized computing;computation;converge;effective method;emergence;like button;network packet;network switch;router (computing);routing table;software propagation;software-defined networking	Deepthi Gopi;Samuel Cheng;Robert C.

The tree connection is based on the use of local identifiers that are swapped at every intermediate node of the tree. Local identifiers are simple to manage, provide fast access to the routing tables, and are very efficient in terms of the size of the resulting routing space. The context of the present work is a high-speed network in which the local label swapping on data messages is performed in hardware by the switching subsystem, while the connection setup is done in software by the switch control subsystem. The correctness of the protocol is formally proved. The protocol ensures the integrity of the tree, and, when failures occur, the tree is gracefully degraded into a smaller tree. >		Adrian Segall;Tsipora P.

5523695fac7de6cd84bc933759d6e64fa83e1426	detector: a topology-aware monitoring system for data center networks		Troubleshooting network performance issues is a challenging task especially in large-scale data center networks. This paper presents deTector, a network monitoring system that is able to detect and localize network failures (manifested mainly by packet losses) accurately in near real time while minimizing the monitoring overhead. deTector achieves this goal by tightly coupling detection and localization and carefully selecting probe paths so that packet losses can be localized only according to end-to-end observations without the help of additional tools (e.g., tracert). In particular, we quantify the desirable properties of the matrix of probe paths, i.e., coverage and identifiability, and leverage an efficient greedy algorithm with a good approximation ratio and fast speed to select probe paths. We also propose a loss localization method according to loss patterns in a data center network. Our algorithm analysis, experimental evaluation on a Fattree testbed and supplementary large-scale simulation validate the scalability, feasibility and effectiveness of deTector.	analysis of algorithms;approximation algorithm;data center;end-to-end principle;greedy algorithm;network packet;network performance;overhead (computing);real-time computing;scalability;simulation;testbed;the matrix;traceroute	Yanghua Peng;Ji Yang;Chuan Wu;Chuanxiong Guo;Chengchen Hu;Zongpeng Li	2017			parallel computing;data center;detector;distributed computing;computer science	OS	-9.134565574363599	80.84787666639369	192633

To retain a good quality of service (QOS), the computer network is required to preserve a sufficient capacity level so that it can send d units of data from the source (a cloud computing center) to the sink (a set of clients) through multiple paths within time T. Thus, the maintenance action should be taken when the computer network falls to a specific state so that it cannot provide sufficient capacity to satisfy demand d. Given the maintenance budget B and time constraint T, we evaluate the probability that d units of data can be sent from the source to the sink, where the probability is referred to as the system reliability. A branch-and-bound approach including an adjusting procedure is proposed to obtain all minimal capacity vectors satisfying d, B, and T. Subsequently, the corresponding system reliability can be derived in terms of such vectors by applying the recursive sum of disjoint products algorithm. 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Although the shift from a traditionally packet-switched core to switching between server aggregations (or servers) at circuit granularity requires system redesign, the approach has been shown to fit well to the traffic requirements of certain classes of high-performance computing applications, as well as to the traffic patterns exhibited by typical data center workloads. Recent proposals for such system designs have looked at small/medium scale hybrid interconnects. In this paper, we present a hybrid optical/electrical interconnect architecture intended for large-scale deployments of high-performance computing systems and server co-locations. To reduce complexity, our architecture employs a regular shuffle network topology that allows for simple management and cabling. Thanks to using a single-stage core interconnect and multiple optical planes, our design can be both incrementally scaled up (in capacity) and scaled out (in the number of racks) without requiring major re-cabling and network re-configuration. Also, we are the first to our knowledge to explore the benefit of using multi-hopping in the optical domain as a means to avoid constant reconfiguration of optical circuit switches. We have prototyped our architecture at packet-level detail in a simulation framework to evaluate this concept. Our results demonstrate that our hybrid interconnect, by adapting to the changing nature of application traffic, can significantly exceed the throughput of a static interconnect of equal degree, while at times attaining a throughput comparable to that of a costly fully-connected network. We also show a further benefit brought by multi-hopping, that it reduces the performance drops by reducing the frequency of reconfiguration.	computer cluster;computer port (hardware);data center;electrical connection;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;network packet;network switch;network topology;packet switching;requirement;server (computing);simulation;supercomputer;throughput	Diego Lugones;Kostas Katrinis;Martin Collier	2012		10.1145/2212908.2212913	embedded system;real-time computing;engineering;computer network	Arch	-10.877039488107433	80.15102722740191	193977

Most researches focused on protecting unicast traffic against the failure of a single network component such as a link or a node. In this paper, we investigate the protection scheme for multicast traffic in meshed WDM optical networks under dual-link failure consideration, and propose a novel protection algorithm called shared segment protection with reprovisioning (SSPR). Through dynamically adjusting link-cost according to the current network state, SSPR establishes a primary light-tree and corresponding link-disjoint backup segments for each multicast connection request. A backup segment can efficiently share wavelength capacity of its working tree or the common resource of other backup segments. Capacity reprovisioning establishes new segments for the vulnerable connections after a link failure and tolerates following link failures. The simulation results show that SSPR not only can make good use of wavelength resources and protect multicast sessions against any single-link failure, but also can greatly improve the traffic restorability in the event of dual-link breakdown.	multicast;wavelength-division multiplexing	Luhua Liao;Lemin Li;Sheng Wang	2008	J.

When traffic is forwarded between the many ASes on the Internet according to that protocol, each AS selfishly routes the traffic inside its own network according to some internal protocol that supports the local objectives of the AS. We consider possibilities of achieving higher global performance in such systems while maintaining the objectives and costs of the individual ASes. In particular, we consider how path trading, i.e. deviations from routing the traffic using individually optimal protocols, can lead to a better global performance. Shavitt and Singer (âLimitations and Possibilities of Path Trading between Autonomous Systemsâ, INFOCOM 2010) were the first to consider the computational complexity of finding such path trading solutions. They show that the problem is weakly NP-hard and provide a dynamic program to find path trades between pairs of ASes. In this paper we improve upon their results, both theoretically and practically. First, we show that finding path trades between sets of ASes is also strongly NP-hard. Moreover, we provide an algorithm that finds all Pareto-optimal path trades for a pair of two ASes. While in principal the number of Pareto-optimal path trades can be exponential, in our experiments this number was typically small. We use the framework of smoothed analysis to give theoretical evidence that this is a general phenomenon, and not only limited to the instances on which we performed experiments. The computational results show that our algorithm yields far superior running times and can solve considerably larger instances than the previous dynamic program.	algorithm;autonomous system (internet);border gateway protocol;computation;computational complexity theory;experiment;fast fourier transform;internet;np-hardness;pareto efficiency;reachability;routing;smoothed analysis;smoothing;time complexity	AndrÃ© Berger;Heiko RÃ¶glin;Ruben van der Zwaan	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-20662-7_4	smoothed analysis;mathematical optimization;border gateway protocol;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;computational complexity theory;path vector protocol;algorithm	Metrics	-7.135876993341094	78.64600562794463	195375

For efficient use of network resources, it is important to efficiently map traffic demands to network resources. However, most of the existing TE schemes are not aware of underlying network topology, Indeed, they try to dynamically map traffic demands to network resources in response to traffic trends in a short period of time. The paper addresses the issue of network congestion due to inefficient mapping between traffic demand and network resources. We propose a new routing metric to allocate forwarding route from source node to its destinations for effective use of network resources in scale-free networks. We show that the best routing metric is $p$-norm based on node degrees along a path to destination node. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the parameter, $p$, on congestion level of each link, and show the best parameter $p$ to minimize the maximum stress centrality in a network.	centrality;load balancing (computing);metrics (networking);network congestion;network topology;routing;test engineer	Hitomi Tamura;Masato Uchida;Masato Tsuru;Jun'ichi Shimada;Takeshi Ikenaga;Yuji Oie	2011	2011 IEEE/IPSJ International Symposium on Applications and the Internet	10.1109/SAINT.2011.96	traffic generation model;routing table;routing domain;routing;network planning and design;static routing;network traffic control;the internet;overlay network;network architecture;hierarchical routing;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;load balancing;multipath routing;ip forwarding;distributed computing;routing protocol;law;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;network topology;computer network;network traffic simulation	Networks	-9.238483361063741	78.99780308806474	195605

This problem is more challenging than the traditional one for electronic communication networks, because it has the wavelength-continuous constraint and it involves routing and wavelength assignment. In this problem, we are given the number of lightpaths required by every node pair and a cost specification, and our objective is to determine a physical topology of minimal cost. We formulate the problem, prove that it is NP-hard, and design an efficient algorithm called two-stage cut saturation algorithmfor it. In the first stage, we relax the wavelength-continuous constraint and apply the main idea of the cut saturation method to determine a good initial network. In the second stage, we impose the wavelength-continuous constraint and perform routing and wavelength assignment to establish the specified lightpaths on the initial network. When some lightpaths cannot be established, we apply the main idea of the cut saturation method to optimize the insertion of additional links into the network. Simulation results show the following: 1) the proposed algorithm can efficiently design networks with low costs and high utilization and 2) if wavelength converters are available to support full wavelength conversion, the total cost of the links can be significantly reduced.	algorithm;np-hardness;routing and wavelength assignment;saturation arithmetic;simulation;telecommunications network	Gaoxi Xiao;Yiu-Wing Leung;Kwok-Wah Hung	2001	IEEE Trans.

The proposed protocol has high scalability and speed, but at the cost of increased computational complexity. To provide the maximum level of transparency, the protocol skips any optical power monitoring or spectrum analysis at the intermediate nodes of established lightpaths. Moreover, to narrow down the associated time and space complexities, it restricts the fault-localisation area to a small area called limited-perimeter. These functions are implemented by means of five phases, namely pausing, flooding, multicasting, matching, and concluding. Although the protocol has been developed to pinpoint single failures, it could track down multiple failures that occur in nonoverlapped limited-perimeters. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, time and space complexities are calculated and compared with a counterpart protocol that does not limit the fault-localisation area.	computational complexity theory;dspace;distributed control system;multicast;perimeter;scalability;telecommunications network	Atousa Vali Sichani;H.

This could enable the provisioning of many desired services in the current architecture and allow effective sharing and use of resources. Providing virtual networks (VNs) means that virtual nodes and links need to be embedded in the underlying shared infrastructure. This embedding process, where VNs with resource demands are mapped onto a substrate with finite resources is a challenging and NP-hard problem. In this paper the focus is on mapping the VNs in such a way that node resources in the substrate are not completely exhausted. To achieve this objective, an approach referred to as bottleneck node reduced mapping is presented. This method is evaluated and compared with an approach, where resource exhaustion is not considered.	artificial neural network;embedded system;internet;np-hardness;provisioning;resource exhaustion attack	Adil Razzaq;Peter SjÃ¶din;Markus Hidell	2011	2011 International Conference on the Network of the Future	10.1109/NOF.2011.6126679	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-11.683708418715781	81.45146660946646	198176

a2781f4b5d1dfdd8ff2d7d1bb0295f579c46d1d9	path-based multipath protection: resilience using multiple paths		The Multipath Protection (MPP) network resilience methods route and protect the upcoming demand over multiple paths. Although these schemes are able to allocate resources efficiently in the network, the length of the paths that the packets traverse cannot be controlled. Accordingly, to control the latency of the connections, we reuse the idea of MPP when we propose the Path-based Multipath Protection (PMPP) scheme. By controlling the maximal length of the paths, we increase the availability as well, because on shorter paths, fewer failures happen. The contribution of our work is threefold. First, we give the linear programming formulation of the PMPP method that does not have any integer variables resulting from polynomial runtime, similar to the former MPP methods. Second, we present extensive simulation results including the blocking ratios, the properties of the paths and the availabilities. Finally, we compare the PMPP resilience scheme with the original and improved versions of MPP method on the basis of several metrics. Copyright Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. *Correspondence L.

The method is based on a dynamical system, called attractor selection, which models behavior where living organisms adapt to unknown changes in their surrounding environments and recover their conditions. One of important things of our VNT control method is how to determine attractors, i.e., VNT candidates, because a VNT configured by our VNT method finally converges on one of the VNT candidates. However, since the number of VNT candidates is limited, it is crucial that the limited number of attractors have diversity so that various kinds of VNTs are searched by attractor selection. In this paper, we propose a method to decide the VNT candidates. Our approach prepares the VNT candidates whose bottleneck links (lightpaths) are different to each other. However, this approach has a problem that it takes a heavy computational time for large-scaled networks. We therefore propose a method that divides a network into clusters for which our algorithm can be applied. Evaluation results show that the VNT candidates prepared by our method can suppress maximum link utilization than the ones prepared in a random manner or by an existing heuristic algorithm.	algorithm;computation;control theory;dynamical system;heuristic (computer science);network topology;time complexity	Toshihiko Ohba;Shin'ichi Arakawa;Yuki Koizumi;Masayuki Murata	2015	2015 12th Annual IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2015.7157997	stochastic process;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;distributed computing;optical switch;network topology;computer network	Robotics	-7.324789058984459	79.8924386556816	198515

An amplifier placement algorithm using spanning tree traversal is proposed. Using this algorithm, the authors show that it is possible to equalize the arriving optical signals at each receiver of the network. This technique enhances other static or dynamic gain equalization schemes and presents a more effective and robust solution to the power equalization problem for WDMA networks with arbitrary topology. >	optical amplifier	Chung-Sheng Li;Franklin Fuk-Kay Tong;Christos J.
