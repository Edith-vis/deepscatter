Its major feature is the use of the line adjacency graph for the contour in order to fill correctly nonconvex and multiply connected regions, while starting from a “seed.” Because the same graph is used for a “parity check” filling algorithm, the two types of algorithms can be combined into one. This combination is useful for either finding a seed through a parity check, or for resolving ambiguities in parity on the basis of connectivity.	algorithm;contour line;parity bit;raster graphics	Theodosios Pavlidis	1981		10.1145/800224.806786	combinatorics;shading;computer science;theoretical computer science;graph traversal;mathematics	Graphics	35.73523117272067	19.901593988658654	120933

As a main result we show that the number of different order types that can be obtained as cross-sections of L is O(n9), and that this bound is tight.

454085ea37e71bbbbd907014656f10c9e99be976	contraction and expansion of convex sets	nonconvex;helly type theorems;hausdorff distance;convex set	Let S be a set system of convex sets in R. Helly’s theorem states that if all sets in S have empty intersection, then there is a subset S ′ ⊂ S of size d+1 which also has empty intersection. The conclusion fails, of course, if the sets in S are not convex or if S does not have empty intersection. Nevertheless, in this work we present Helly type theorems relevant to these cases with the aid of a new pair of operations, affine-invariant contraction and expansion of convex sets. These operations generalize the simple scaling of centrally symmetric sets. The operations are continuous, i.e., for small ε > 0, the contraction C−ε and the expansion C are close (in Hausdorff) to C. We obtain two results. The first extends Helly’s theorem to the case of set systems with non-empty intersection: (a) If S is any family of convex sets in R then there is a finite subfamily S ′ ⊆ S whose cardinality depends only on ε and d, such that ∩C∈S′C−ε ⊆ ∩C∈SC. The second result allows the sets in S a limited type of non-convexity: (b) If S is a family of sets in R, each of which is the union of k fat convex sets, then there is a finite subfamily S ′ ⊆ S whose cardinality depends only on ε, d and k, such that ∩C∈S′C−ε ⊆ ∩C∈SC.	ada;convex function;convex set;emoticon;hausdorff dimension;image scaling	Michael Langberg;Leonard J.

In the currently known constructions, most of the effort is put on garanteeing the size of the output object, whereas the geometrical efficiency of the assembling of the shape itself is left aside. We propose in this paper a framework to obtain provably time efficient selfassembling tile systems. Our approach consists in studying how the flow of information has to circulate within the desired shape to guarantee an optimal time construction. We show how this study can yield an adequate ordering of the tiling process from which one can deduced a provably time efficient tile systems for that shape. We apply our framework to squares and cubes for which we obtain time optimal self-assembling tile systems.	cubes;gnu nano;olap cube;self-assembly;tiling window manager	Florent Becker;Eric Rémila;Nicolas Schabanel	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-03076-5_12	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;engineering drawing	Theory	33.25151138646435	18.475706769036144	124422

An n-omino is de ned generally as a connected union of n unit squares on the integer grid. Our best dissection uses 2(n 1) polygons. We generalize this result to the connected unions of nonoverlapping equal-size regular k-gons joined edge-toedge, which includes n-iamonds (k = 3) and n-hexes (k = 6). Our best dissection uses dk=2e(n 1) polygons. We also explore polyabolos, that is, connected unions of nonoverlapping equal-size isosceles right triangles joined edge-to-edge, and give a hinged dissection using 4n polygons. Finally, we generalize our result about regular polygons to connected unions of nonoverlapping copies of any polygon P , all with the same orientation, that join corresponding edges of P . This solution uses kn pieces where k is the number of vertices of P .	existential quantification;gon;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;olap cube;polygon (computer graphics);vertex (geometry)	Erik D.

He investigates the link between the topological complexity and the number of exchanges in a sequentialisation. The theorem he achieves is about a particular rule of exchange (transpositions by blocks). We complete his approach by showing that the topological complexity does not provide any information in other cases (arbitrary exchange, upper bound of the number of exchanges). Then, we show that, on the other hand, the surface associated to a proof-structure is the surface of minimal complexity on which the proof can be drawn without crossing and respecting the local orientation.

It is shown that there exists continuous affine invariants. It is shown that many curves can be projected arbitrarily close to a circle in a strengthened Hausdorff metric. This does not infer any limitations on projective invariants, but it is clear that projective normalization by maximizing compactness is unsuitable. It is also shown that arbitrarily close to each of a finite number of closed planar curves there is one member of a set of projectively equivalent curves. Thus there can not exist continuous projective invariants, and a projective normalisation scheme can not have both the properties of continuity and uniqueness. Although uniqueness might be preferred it is not essential for recognition. This is illustrated with an example of a projective normalization scheme for non-algebraic, both convex and non-convex, curves (Less)		Kalle Åström	1993		10.1007/3-540-58240-1_11	projective plane;line at infinity;rational normal curve;projective line;projective space;duality;projective geometry;discrete mathematics;topology;homography;projective harmonic conjugate;quaternionic projective space;blocking set;twisted cubic;collineation;mathematics;geometry;projective cover;projective orthogonal group;complex projective space;projective differential geometry;correlation;real projective line;pencil	Vision	38.94987682431594	24.3592554227319	127575

Thus a key problem is to estimate the error of the approximation. So far, many papers have given various estimate bounds of the distance between a parametric patch of a C 2 surface and an arbitrary triangle whose vertices are on the patch, but these estimates are all imperfect, some of them have large error, some of them have complicated representation formulae. By using a succinct new method, a sharp upper estimate of the maximum distance between a patch and a triangle is obtained and a strict proof is given. This is very valuable for CAGD.	approximation algorithm;computer graphics;computer-aided design;geometric design;interpolation;parametric array	Renjiang Zhang;Guojin Wang	2008	Science in China Series F: Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-008-0018-0	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;triangulation;computer science;mathematics;geometry;upper and lower bounds	Theory	34.208996396496936	20.097740989529726	133064

Among the alternative transforms which possess the APIC property, one of the most interesting is polar transform (PT) which exchanges a point (a, b) and the straight line with equation ax+by=1. This transform represents classical duality between a pole and its polar line with respect to the unit circle. Another property common to both HT and PT is the correspondence between the shapes' Boundary Length and connected Areas (BLA property), either directly or compensated by a weight function, allowing an efficient measure of these lengths on a digital screen. PT is shown to be connected to projective and integral (or stochastic) geometry with an important role given to a weight function 1/d/sup 3/.	hough transform;image processing	Jean-Marie Becker;Stéephane Grousson;Daniela Coltuc	2002		10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1026143	integral geometry;hough transform;combinatorics;weight function;topology;image processing;multiple sequence alignment;mathematics;geometry;statistics;stochastic geometry	Vision	37.25568919432973	21.814490731354873	133624

Researchers have investigated multiple variations of these notions, including orthogonal, finitely oriented, and restricted-orientation visibility and convexity, as well as nesw and link convexity. Rawlins introduced the notions of strong visibility and convexity in his doctoral dissertation, as part of his research on restricted-orientation geometry. Rawlins and Wood studied strongly convex sets, and demonstrated that they generalize not only standard convexity, but also the notions of ortho-rectangles and C-oriented polygons.

It was shown that there are infinitely many orthogonal polygons that fold to two incongruent orthogonal boxes in 2008. In this paper, we first show that there is an orthogonal polygon that fold to three boxes of size 1×1×5, 1 × 2 × 3, and 0 × 1 × 11. Although we have to admit a box to have volume 0, this solves the open problem mentioned in literature. Moreover, once we admit that a box can be of volume 0, a long rectangular strip can be folded to an arbitrary number of boxes of volume 0. We next consider for finding common non-orthogonal developments that fold to plural incongruent orthogonal boxes. In literature, only orthogonal folding lines or with 45 degree lines were considered. In this paper, we show some polygons that can fold to two incongruent orthogonal boxes in more general directions.	fold (higher-order function)	Zachary Abel;Erik D. Demaine;Martin L.

These systems are known to be Hamiltonian or reversible. Here we provide an improvement of the algorithm that characterizes these systems and we give a new normal form. Our main result is the systematic classification of the global phase portraits of the cubic Hamiltonian irs-systems respecting time (i.e. σ = 1) up to topological and diffeomorphic equivalence. In particular there are 22 (resp. 14) topologically different global phase portraits for the Hamiltonian (resp. reversible Hamiltonian) irs-systems on the Poincaré disc. Finally we illustrate how to generalize our results to polynomial irs-systems of arbitrary degree. In particular we study the bifurcation diagram of a 1-parameter subfamily of quintic Hamiltonian irs-systems. Moreover we indicate how to construct a concrete reversible irs-system with a given configuration of singularities respecting their topological type and separatrix connections.		M.

ae5ad334125b5d03fd89e7ff73b78165a6e9bbed	piercing d -intervals		A (homogeneous) d-interval is a union of d closed intervals in the line. Using topological methods, Tardos and Kaiser proved that for any finite collection of d-intervals that contains no k + 1 pairwise disjoint members, there is a set of O(dk) points that intersects each member of the collection. Here we give a short, elementary proof of this result. A (homogeneous) d-interval is a union of d closed intervals in the line. Let H be a finite collection of d-intervals. The transversal number τ(H) of H is the minimum number of points that intersect every member of H. The matching number ν(H) of H is the maximum number of pairwise disjoint members of H. Gyárfás and Lehel [3] proved that τ ≤ O(νd!) and Kaiser [4] proved that τ ≤ O(d2ν). His proof is topological, applies the Borsuk-Ulam theorem and extends and simplifies a result of Tardos [5]. Here we give a very short, elementary proof of a similar estimate, using the method of [2]. Theorem 1 Let H be a finite family of d-intervals containing no k + 1 pairwise disjoint members. Then τ(H) ≤ 2d2k. Proof. Let H′ be any family of d-intervals obtained from H by possibly duplicating some of its members, and let n denote the cardinality of H′. Note that H′ contains no k + 1 pairwise disjoint members. Therefore, by Turán’s Theorem, there are at least n(n − k)/(2k) unordered intersecting pairs of members of H′. Each such intersecting pair supplies at least 2 ordered pairs (p, I), where p is an end point of one of the intervals in a member of H′, I is a different member of H′, and p lies in I. Since there are altogether at most 2dn possible choices for p, there is such a point that lies in at least n(n−k) k2dn members of H ′ besides the one in which it is an endpoint of an interval, showing that there is a point that lies in at least n 2dk of the members of H ′. This implies that for any rational weights on the members of H there is a point that lies in at least a fraction 1 2dk of the total weight. By the min-max theorem it follows that there is a collection of m points so that each member of H contains at least m/(2dk) of them, and thus contains an interval that contains at least m/(2d2k) of the points. Order the points from left to right, and take the set of all points whose rank in this ordering is divisible by dm/(2d2k)e. This is a set of at most 2d2k points that intersects each member of H, completing the proof. 2 Remarks. It may be possible to improve the constant factor in the above proof. Kaiser’s estimate is indeed better by roughly a factor of 2; τ(H) ≤ (d2 − d+ 1)ν(H). It will be interesting to decide if the quadratic dependence on d is indeed best possible.

First, we show that, if the convex cone is not homogeneous, then the duality mapping does not have to be an involution. Next, we show that there are very elementary convex cones that are not homogeneous but have invariant CarathA©odory number in the interior. Third, we show that the invariance of the CarathA©odory number in the interior of the convex cone does not suffice to make the cone homogeneous even if the cone is self-dual. Finally, we characterize the CarathA©odory number of epigraphs of matrix norms.		Levent Tunçel;Song Xu	2001	Math. Oper.

The cd-index was first defined by J. Fine (see [3], Proposition 2.). The intriguing property of the cd-index due to Stanley [14] is that it is nonnegative (i.e., all its coefficients are nonnegative) for all (face posets of) simplicial spheres, and, more generally, for all Gorenstein ∗ s mplicial posets (that is, Eulerian and Cohen–Macaulay posets). (Another large class of complexes with nonnegative cd-index is the class of S-shellable spheres, which ncludes, for example, all convex polytopes, see [ 4, 14].) The aim of this paper is to extend Stanley’s theorem in the following way: our main result is that many of the coefficients of the cd-index of an odd-dimensional simplicial manifold (i.e., a simplicial complex whose geometric realization is a manifold) are positive. (By Poincaŕ e’s duality theorem every odd-dimensional simplicial manifold is a Eulerian complex, and thereforeits cd-index is well defined.) Even more generally, the same result holds for all odd-dimensional simplicial complexes which are Eulerian and Buchsbaum (over a field of characteristic 0).

This algorithm may on occasion report failure, but it can then be repeated with a modified isolating interval and a likelihood of success.		Scott McCallum;George E. Collins	2002	J. Symb.

Supermodularity of the λ function which defines a permutation polytope has proved to be crucial for the polytope to have some nice fundamental properties. Supermodularity has been established for the λ function for the sum-partition problem under various models. On the other hand, supermodularity has not been established for the mean-partition problem even for the most basic labeled single-shape model. In this paper, we fill this gap and also settle for all other models except one. We further extend our results to other types of supermodularity.		F. H. Chang;Frank K. Hwang	2005	J.

0c896e18c0147cc33b744dda1d85bacb0c642c71	walk on city maps - mathematical and physical phenomenology of the city, a geometrical approach. (promenade dans les cartes de villes - phénoménologie mathématique et physique de la ville - une approche géométrique)		We are interested in the phenomenology of cities by restricting them to the geometry of their street network. This study aims at being synthetic, functional and interdisciplinary. It follows the large work that has been performed from the early XXth century by townplanners, social scientists, geographers, statisticians, physicists. We try to demonstrate that the street as a coherent alignment of street segments can be considered as an essential elementary structure of the city. How much information is encoded in the street network? To what extent does it constraint the city use? How are the current urban layout and its evolution determined jointly by tra c axis and structuring elements? We present a mathematical and computational framework allowing to consider the map of a city as a geometric continuum associated to the topology of a planar graph. To this graph we juxtapose a hypergraph structure using the street geometry to obtain easily the notion of axis and a multi-scale representation of the city. In spite of an apparent shape diversity, we show that the street network of a city is subjected to general laws that leave hallmarks on a city map. We propose several morphogenesis models of the city, implementing the idea that the city's growth follows a structured extension / division of space logic and able to reproduce hallmarks observed on actual maps. The understanding of regulation mechanism of the city allows us to propose functional algorithms whose computational e ciencies are very interesting. We present an algorithm recovering streets from a collection of street segments; the notion of simplest centrality whose calculus on a map allows a hierarchical analysis of it, revealing for instance main tra c axis and ill-deserved area; a fast approximate algorithm to nd the shortest path between two random points; and a Spectral Clustering based algorithm to produce morphological segmentations of maps. We also work on the identi cation of random tessellation models to be substituted to an actual road network and to solve large optimization problems using statistical equivalence.	apache axis;approximation algorithm;centrality;centre de morphologie mathématique;coherence (physics);computation;linear algebra;map;mathematical optimization;planar graph;shortest path problem;spectral clustering;synthetic intelligence;triune continuum paradigm;turing completeness	Thomas Courtat	2012				ML	39.16280541418025	21.53621076540982	141900

The polygon is input as a chain of incremental moves. These algorithms are automatic in the sense that they require no manually specified interior point. First a distinction is made between two possible coordinate systems for a raster display, the region-oriented and vector-oriented coordinate systems. The Edge Fill algorithm of Ackland and Weste is given for the region-oriented coordinate system, and then is adapted for the vector-oriented coordinate system. Next the algorithm is enhanced in two ways, denoted Fence Fill and Pairwise Fill, which trade storage for speed. Finally, in the Appendix, a correctness property of the vector-oriented version of Edge Fill is proved.	algorithm;correctness (computer science);graph coloring;raster graphics	M. R.

Based on this definition of weak convexity, we introduce a spectral method that decomposes a given shape into weakly convex regions. The decomposition is applied without explicitly measuring the convexity rank. The method merely amounts to a spectral clustering of a matrix representing the all-pairs line of sight. Our method can be directly applied on an oriented point cloud and does not require any topological information, nor explicit concavity or convexity measures. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm on a large number of examples and compare them qualitatively with competitive approaches.	algorithm;cluster analysis;concave function;convex function;point cloud;spectral clustering;spectral method	Shmuel Asafi;Avi Goren;Daniel Cohen-Or	2013	Comput.

The discovery process consists of moving a point probing device in the free space around O so that it repeatedly comes in contact with S. We propose a probing strategy for generating a sequence of surface samples on S from which a triangulated surface can be generated that approximates S within any desired accuracy. We bound the number of probes and the number of elementary moves of the probing device. Our solution is an extension of previous work on Delaunay refinement techniques for surface meshing. The approximating surface we generate enjoys the many nice properties of the meshes obtained by those techniques, e.g. exact topological type, normal approximation, etc.	apache axis;approximation;constraint (mathematics);convex set;delaunay triangulation;displacement mapping;elementary;euclidean distance;functional renormalization group;ibm notes;medial graph;refinement (computing);ruppert's algorithm;sampling (signal processing);voronoi diagram	Jean-Daniel Boissonnat;Leonidas J.

This condition is based on the general properties of the distance function to a compact set and relies on the recently introduced critical function and μ-reach.	apache axis;complement (complexity);computer-aided design;geometric design;image processing;medial graph;smoothing	Frédéric Chazal;David Cohen-Steiner;André Lieutier;Boris Thibert	2007		10.1145/1236246.1236273	mathematical optimization;medial axis;metric;image processing;mathematics;geometry;offset;solid modeling;upper and lower bounds;smoothing	Theory	33.85935473676204	20.92261859516945	144617

It appeared to be a very useful parameter to determine the area of lattice figures in the planar tilings with congruent regular polygons. The purpose of this paper is to extend the notion of the boundary characteristic to lattice polyhedra inR 3 . Studying some of its properties we show, in particular, that it can be applied to determine the volume of lattice polyhedra.	polyhedron	Krzysztof Kolodziejczyk	1998	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/S0012-365X(98)00039-9	hexagonal lattice;lattice plane;combinatorics;lattice reduction;topology;primitive cell;empty lattice approximation;lattice model;integer lattice;congruence lattice problem;mathematics;geometry;lattice;map of lattices;lattice field theory;particle in a one-dimensional lattice;reciprocal lattice	Vision	36.234512571600575	22.76948431163729	146095

We first establish some general properties about such configurations and give conditions of existence of double contacts for two or three objects. For three convex polygons moving in a polygonal environment or three simple polygons moving in a rectangle there always exists a double contact. Two examples without possibility of double contacts are given, one with three polygons (not convex) moving in a polygonal environment, and one with four convex polygons moving in a rectangle. We deduce an algorithm detecting a double contact position in time O(n) (resp. O(n)) for two (resp. three) convex polygons of constant sizes moving in a non-convex polygon of size n. keywords: Motion planning, polygon containment, robotics.	algorithm;connected component (graph theory);francis;fastest;jean;motion planning;polyhedron;robotics;sensor	Olivier Devillers	1993	Int.

The vol ume of the latter is u003c 0.95, as the reader can deduce from the calculations above. Thus at some point the volume of P? stops increasing and maximizes at about 1.1820. In [3], Bleecker presented a different isometric deformation of a cube, where the vol ume maximizes at about 1.2187. This value was further improved to 1.2567 in [4]. The largest value obtained by a bending of a cube remains an open problem (see [7]). The construction in this paper is a special case of a general approach by the au thor [7].

We then use this result to quantify the extent of a neighbourhood on which the Riemannian barycentric coordinates of a set of n+1 points on an n-manifold provide a true coordinate chart, i.e., the barycentric coordinates provide a di↵eomorphism between a neighbourhood of a Euclidean simplex, and a neighbourhood containing the points on the manifold.	barycentric subdivision	Ramsay Dyer;Gert Vegter;Mathijs Wintraecken	2016	CoRR		isometry;mathematical analysis;topology;mathematics;geometry;barycentric coordinate system;harmonic coordinates	Vision	37.61942807239486	21.56234130991109	149643

On the other hand, we prove that any such polyhedron must have genus at least 3. These results improve the bounds of Donoso and O’Rourke [4] that there are nonorthogonal polyhedra with orthogonal faces and genus 7 or larger, and any such polyhedron must have genus at least 2. We also demonstrate nonoverlapping one-piece edge-unfoldings (nets) for the genus-7 and genus-6 polyhedra.	genus (mathematics);polyhedron	Therese C. Biedl;Timothy M. Chan;Erik D. Demaine;Martin L.

a9974d4e323379ba877e3551f04062fcdbb487e0	measuring linearity of planar curves	qa75 electronic computers computer science	In this paper we define a new linearity measure which can be applied to open planar curve segments. We have considered the sum of the distances between the curve end points and the curve centroid. We have shown that this sum is bounded from above by the length of the curve segment considered. In addition, we have proven that this sum equals the length of the curve segment only in the case of straight line segments. Exploiting such a nice characterization of straight line segments, we define a new linearity measure for planar curves. The new measure ranges over the interval (0, 1], and produces the value 1 if and only if the measured line is a perfect straight line segment. Also, the new linearity measure is invariant with respect to translations, rotations and scaling transformations.	approximation algorithm;graph (discrete mathematics);image scaling;linear discriminant analysis;recurrence plot;requirement	Jovisa D.

afd3cc7595227af7b2916b2bd4301166a76237cd	transversal helly numbers, pinning theorems and projection of simplicial complexes. (nombres de helly, théorèmes d'épinglement et projection de complexes simpliciaux)		The efficient resolution of various problems in computational geometry, for instance visibility computation or shape approximation, raises new questions in line geometry, a classical area going back to the mid-19th century. This thesis fits into this theme, and studies Helly numbers of certain sets of lines, an index related to certain basis theorems arising in computational geometry and combinatorial optimization. Formally, the Helly number of a family of sets with empty intersection is the size of its largest inclusion-wise minimal sub-family with empty intersection. For d > 2 let Hd denote the least integer such that for any family {B1, . . . ,Bn} of pairwise disjoint balls of equal radius in R, the Helly number of {T(B1), . . . ,T(Bn)} is at most Hd, where T(Bi) denotes the set of lines intersecting Bi. In 1957, Ludwig Danzer showed that H2 equals 5 and conjectured that Hd is finite for all d > 2 and increases with d. We establish that Hd is at least 2d− 1 and at most 4d− 1 for any d > 2, proving the first conjecture and providing evidence in support of the second one. To study Danzer’s conjectures, we introduce the pinning number, a local analogue of the Helly number that is related to grasping questions studied in robotics. We further show that pinning numbers can be bounded for sufficiently generic families of polyhedra or ovaloids in R, two situations where Helly numbers can be arbitrarily large. A theorem of Tverberg asserts that when {B1, . . . ,Bn} are disjoint translates of a convex figure in the plane, the Helly number of {T(B1), . . . ,T(Bn)} is at most 5. Although quite different, both our and Tverberg’s proofs use, in some way, that the intersection of at least two T(Bi)’s has a bounded number of connected components, each contractible. Using considerations on homology of projection of simplicial complexes and posets, we unify the two proofs and show that such topological condition suffice to ensure explicit bounds on Helly numbers.

0acfcdc2a3d9cb2803d63570fb0d68bebd84be6a	on low discrepancy samplings in product spaces of motion groups		Deterministically generating near-uniform point samplings of the motion groups like SO(3), SE(3) and their n-wise products SO(3), SE(3) is fundamental to numerous applications in computational and data sciences. The natural measure of sampling quality is discrepancy. In this work, our main goal is construct low discrepancy deterministic samplings in product spaces of the motion groups. To this end, we develop a novel strategy (using a two-step discrepancy construction) that leads to an almost exponential improvement in size (from the trivial direct product). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first nontrivial construction for SO(3),SE(3) and the hypertorus T. We also construct new low discrepancy samplings of S and SO(3). The central component in our construction for SO(3) is an explicit construction of N points in S with discrepancy Õ(1/ √ N) with respect to convex sets, matching the bound achieved for the special case of spherical caps in [ABD12]. We also generalize the discrepancy of Cartesian product sets [Cha04] to the discrepancy of local Cartesian product sets. The tools we develop should be useful in generating low discrepancy samplings of other complicated geometric spaces. ∗Department of Computer Science and The Institute of Computational Engineering and Sciences, Center for Computational Visualization, The University of Texas at Austin.

Moreover, we generalize this result for higher dimensions and more general patterns. It complements recent results concerning line 2-nonrepetitive colorings of the plane.	color;graph coloring;lambda cube	Michal Debski;Jaroslaw Grytczuk;Urszula Pastwa;Barbara Pilat;Joanna Sokól;Michal Tuczynski;Przemyslaw Wenus;Krzysztof Wesek	2017	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2017.06.056		Theory	32.69487771988821	23.59608573002021	154581

An efficient combinatorial algorithm to construct an approximate 3D orthogonal convex skull of a digital object is presented in this paper. The 3D orthogonal inner cover, an orthogonal polyhedron which tightly inscribes the digital object, is divided into slab polygons and 2D orthogonal skulls of these slab polygons are combined together using combinatorial techniques to obtain an approximate 3D orthogonal convex skull. The algorithm operates in integer domain and requires at most two passes. The current version of the algorithm deals with non-intersecting objects free from holes and cavities. Experimentation on a wide range of digital objects has provided expected results, some of which are presented here to demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm.

We present a method based on Locality Sensitive Hashing to compute all near neighbours of points within a certain distance. Our construction of the net-forest is probabilistic, and we guarantee that with high probability, the net-forest is supplemented with the correct neighbouring information. We apply our net-forest construction scheme to create an approximate Čech complex up to a fixed scale; and its complexity depends on the local intrinsic dimension up to that scale.	approximation algorithm;intrinsic dimension;locality of reference;locality-sensitive hashing;period-doubling bifurcation;with high probability	Aruni Choudhary;Michael Kerber	2015	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computational geometry;computer science;mathematics;geometry;complex dimension;minkowski–bouligand dimension;algebraic topology	Theory	32.97141819180446	19.028707291843514	156470

This paper examines the properties needed for planar trees to lock, with a focus on finding the smallest locked trees according to different measures of complexity, and suggests some new avenues of research for the problem of algorithmic characterization. First we present a locked linear tree with only eight edges. In contrast, the smallest previous locked tree has 15 edges. We further show minimality by proving that every locked linear tree has at least eight edges. We also show that a six-edge tree can interlock with a four-edge chain, which is the first locking result for individually unlocked trees. Next we present several new examples of locked trees with varying minimality results. Finally, we provide counterexamples to two conjectures of [12], [13] by showing the existence of two new types of locked tree: a locked orthogonal tree (all edges horizontal and vertical) and a locked equilateral tree (all edges unit length).	attack tree;interlock (engineering);linear genetic programming;lock (computer science);time complexity	Brad Ballinger;David Charlton;Erik D.

b70e2ceeefe250d863e8b4dff7ee4517f383adb2	on the limiting distribution for the length of the longest alternating sequence in a random permutation	limit distribution;generating function;random permutation;symmetric group	Recently Richard Stanley initiated a study of the distribution of the length asn(w) of the longest alternating subsequence in a random permutation w from the symmetric group Sn. Among other things he found an explicit formula for the generating function (on n and k) for Pr (asn(w) ≤ k) and conjectured that the distribution, suitably centered and normalized, tended to a Gaussian with variance 8/45. In this note we present a proof of the conjecture based on the generating function. If w = (w1 · · ·wn) is a permutation in the symmetric group Sn then an increasing subsequence of length k is a subsequence wi1 · · ·wik satisfying wi1 < wi2 · · · < wik . The random variable isn(w), the length of the longest increasing sequence in a random permuation w from Sn, has been much studied. Its mean was first determined asymptotically by Logan-Shepp [2] and Vershik-Kerov [4], proving a conjecture of Ulam, and the limiting distribution was determined in the celebrated work of Beik-Deift-Johansson [1]. Recently Richard Stanley [3] initiated a study of the distribution of the length of the longest alternating subsequences of w, a subsequence such that wi1 > wi2 < wi3 > · · ·wik . the electronic journal of combinatorics 13 (2006), #R25 1 If asn(w) denotes the length of the longest alternating sequence in a random permutation w from Sn denote by pn(k) the distribution function for asn(w), pn(k) = 1 n! {#w : asn(w) ≤ k}. Stanley found an explicit formula for the generating function B(x, y) = ∑ k,n≥0 pn(k) y k x. It is given by B(x, y) = 1 + ρ + 2y e + (1 − ρ) e 1 + ρ − y2 + (1 − ρ − y2) e2ρx , where ρ = √ 1 − y2. Using certain consequences of this formula he made the conjecture that the limit K(t) = lim n→∞ pn(2n/3 + √ n t). exists. We shall show here that this is so, and that K(t) is a Gaussian with variance 8/45: K(t) = 1 √ π ∫ t√45/4 −∞ e−s 2 ds. Two other proofs of the conjecture, very different from this one, are indicated in [3]. We use the integral representation pn(k) = 1 (2πi)2 ∫ ∫ B(x, y) x−n−1 y−k−1 dx dy, where the contours of integration are little curves around zero. We begin by making the substitution y = sech u, where u runs along a vertical line from a+iπ to a−iπ, with a a large positive real number. Then y runs counterclockwise around a little curve surrounding zero. With this substitution ρ = √ 1 − sech 2u = tanhu (when y is small ρ is close to 1, which is why ρ is given by this square root rather than its negative) and we find that pn(k) = 1 (2πi)2 ∫ ∫ e u + 2 e e tanh u + e x tanh u e2 u − e2 x tanh u cosh k u x−n−1 dx du, where now u runs from a − πi to a + πi. We perform the x integration first. The poles of the integrand are at x = 0 and x = (u + jπi) cothu, −∞ < j < ∞. the electronic journal of combinatorics 13 (2006), #R25 2 The residue of the quotient in the integrand at the jth point is computed to be zero when j is odd (so there is actually no pole there) and −2 cothu when j is even. We evaluate the x-integral by integrating around a sequence of expanding contours passing half-way between the poles and find that pn(k) = 1 πi ∫ cosh u tanh u ∞ ∑ j=−∞ (u + 2jπi)−n−1 du. (1) (Since j was even we replaced it by 2j.) Because of the periodicity of the integrand, we may take any real a and as contour of integration any curve from a − πi to a + πi as long as it stays in the region |Im u| ≤ π and to the right of the poles at zero and ±iπ/2. Here is how we will proceed. Because u lies in the region |Im u| ≤ π it seems likely that the term of the sum corresponding to j = 0 will dominate the rest. Suppose this is so, and that k will be of the order n, say equal to αn + o(n) for some positive constant α. Then the main part of the resulting integrand will be (cosh u) ( tanhu u )n , which we write as e . The method of steepest descent, or saddle point method, tells us that we should try to take as our contour of integration one on which Imσ(u) is constant and on which Re σ(u) achieves its maximum at a point u0. If u0 is not an end-point of the curve then σ′(u0) = 0. This u0 is a saddle point for the function |eσ(u)| and at all points of the curve its direction away from the saddle point is that of most rapid decrease of the function — whence the names for the method. The main contribution to the integral will come from the immediate neighborhood of the single saddle point, and so one only has to use an expansion of the integrand near this point to determine the asymptotics. In practice one first locates a saddle point, follows a steepest descent curve until it ends (at a zero of the integrand, at another saddle point, or the boundary of the region which could include ∞), and then sees if the original contour may be deformed to it. In our case the saddle points are the zeros of σ′(u) = α sinh u cosh u + 1 sinh u cosh u − 1 u . We shall show that there are three saddle points in the region |Imu| < π, and that they coincide when α = 2/3. Let us consider ∆ argσ′(u) over the boundary of the region, with little semi-circular indentations of diameter δ below the pole at iπ and above the pole at −iπ. Using the The quotient in the integrand equals 1 plus a constant times (1 + eu−x tanh )/ sinh(u − x tanhu). There is an expanding sequence of contours on which this is uniformly bounded. A linear change of variable shows that it is enough to show this for the function (1 + e)/ sinh z. One can take the jth contour to be the square with vertices ±(j + 1/2)π ± (j + 1/2)πi. the electronic journal of combinatorics 13 (2006), #R25 3 fact that σ′(u) is odd we need consider only the upper part. We also use the fact that when Im u = π the first two summands in the expression for σ′(u) are real while −1/u has positive imaginary part. As u goes from +∞ + iπ to −∞ + iπ along the upper boundary with indentation σ′(u) goes from α to δ−1 + O(1) staying in the upper halfplane, then counterclockwise around a large semi-circle (more precisely, within O(1) of one) to −δ−1 + O(1), then to −α while again staying in the upper half-plane. Clearly, then, ∆ argσ′(u) over this upper boundary is π, and so ∆ argσ′(u) over the full boundary is 2π. This means that in our region the number of zeros of σ′(u), counting multiplicity, is one more than the number of poles. There are two poles, at ±iπ/2, so there are three zeros. We compute that in the neighborhood of u = 0 σ(u) = α ( 1 2 u − 1 12 u + O(u) ) − 1 3 u + 7 90 u + O(u). When α = 2/3 this has a zero of order four at u = 0, so σ′(u) has a zero of order three and therefore this is the only saddle point. So we do take α = 2/3, and near u = 0 σ(u) = 1 45 u + O(u). The next step is to determine the steepest descent curve, or at least to describe it in sufficient detail. It is a curve (or curves) emanating from the saddle point on which Im σ(u) is constant (in this case zero) and on which Reσ(u) decreases as we move away from the saddle point. We see that there are four such curves, emanating from 0 in the directions arg u = ±π/4 in the right half-plane and the directions arg u = ±3π/4 in the left half-plane. By the symmetries of σ(u) (namely that it is even and takes conjugate values at conjugate values of u) these curves are reflections of each other in the real and imaginary axes. On all of them σ(u) is real and decreases as we move away from the saddle point. None of the four curves, when extended, can intersect in the interior of the region in question because if they did it would have to be at a saddle point other than u = 0, and there are none. It follows from this, and the symmetry of the four curves, that the ones emanating from zero in the directions arg u = ±π/4 stay in the right half-plane and meet the upper boundary of our region at points a±iπ with a ≥ 0. The two together, from a− iπ to 0 to a+ iπ, constitute the curve we use as our contour. We denote it by Γ. Its important properties are its location (to the right of the poles at ±iπ/2 and therefore giving the same integral as the original contour) and the fact that on it σ(u) is real and decreases from zero as we move away from the saddle point. Let us now take k = 2n/3 + √ n t in (1). The integrand has a pole at u = 0, coming from the term of the sum with j = 0. Since 0 was to the left of the original contour of integration, we replace the term 1/u by 1/(u − ε), then deform the contour to Γ, and then take the limit as ε → 0. This is indicated by replacing the factor 1/u by 1/(u − 0). (The integral arising from this term can also be expressed in terms of a principal value the electronic journal of combinatorics 13 (2006), #R25 4 integral.) Thus (1) becomes in present notation pn(2n/3 + √ n t) = 1 πi ∫ Γ e σ(u) (cosh u) √ n t du u − 0	argument (complex analysis);conjugate variables;contour line;emoticon;expanded memory;gradient descent;imaginary time;longest alternating subsequence;quasiperiodicity;random permutation;reflection (computer graphics);semiconductor industry;the stanley parable;vertical bar	Harold Widom	2006	Electr.

Our complete arcs are obtained by taking the union of such a “seed arc” with some orbits of a subgroup of its stabilizer. Using this approach we construct five different complete 15arcs fixed by Z3 in PG(2, 37), a complete 20-arc fixed by S3 in PG(2, 61), and two different complete 22-arcs fixed by D5 in PG(2, 71). In all three cases, the size of complete arcs constructed in this paper is strictly smaller than the size of the smallest complete arcs (in the respective plane) known so far.	stabilizer code;z3 (computer)	Petr Lisonek;Stefano Marcugini;Fernanda Pambianco	2008	Contributions to Discrete Mathematics		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics	Theory	34.721956677922776	24.30050318911799	159254

0f34ddd16b02f5f68c0087e899c790c362cb4905	arithmetic polygons		We consider the question of the existence of equiangular polygons with edge lengths in arithmetic progression, and show that they do not exist when the number of sides is a power of two and do exist if it is any other even number. A few results for small odd numbers are given. An Olympiad problem [1] asked the following. Prove that there exists a convex 1990-gon with the following two properties: (a) all angles are equal. (b) the lengths of the 1990 sides are the numbers 12, 22, 32, . . . , 19902 in some order. Recently, remembering the question imperfectly, I constructed a convex 1990-gon with side lengths 1, 2, 3, . . . , 1990, and wondered for which other N such an N -gon could be constructed. This note gives a partial answer. Define an arithmetic polygon to be an equiangular polygon with edge lengths forming (upon suitable rearrangement) a nondegenerate arithmetic sequence. Lemma 1. For any N, if there exists an arithmetic N-gon, there exists one such with edge lengths 1, 2, . . . , N. Proof. We work in the complex plane, so that an edge of length L oriented at an angle θ to the positive real axis is represented by the complex number Leiθ . An equiangular N -gon has edge orientations (in cyclic order) e2( j/N )π i , and edge lengths a + p( j)b for some permutation p : (0, 1, . . . , n − 1)→ (0, 1, . . . , n − 1).

Choose at random n points out of N on this circle and append clockwise an arc of integral length k to each such point. The resulting random set is made of a random number of connected components. Questions such as the evaluation of the probability of random covering and parking configurations, number and length of the gaps are addressed. They are the discrete versions of similar problems raised in the continuum. For each value of k, asymptotic results are presented when n,N both go to ∞ according to two different regimes. This model may equivalently be viewed as a random partitioning problem of N items into n recipients. A grand-canonical balls in boxes approach is also supplied, giving some insight into the multiplicities of the box filling amounts or spacings. The latter model is a k−nearest neighbor random graph with N vertices and kn edges. We shall also briefly consider the covering problem in the context of a random graph model with N vertices and n (out-degree 1) edges whose endpoints are no more bound to be neighbors.

53f07956babd8775289061bba1741210eba1a7fd	on reconfiguration of disks in the plane and related problems	convex body;lower bound	We revisit two natural reconfiguration models for systems of disjoint objects in the plane: translation and sliding. Consider a set of n pairwise interior-disjoint objects in the plane that need to be brought from a given start (initial) configuration S into a desired goal (target) configuration T , without causing collisions. In the translation model, in one move an object is translated along a fixed direction to another position in the plane. In the sliding model, one move is sliding an object to another location in the plane by means of a continuous rigid motion (that could involve rotations). We obtain various combinatorial and computational results for these two models: (I) For systems of n congruent unlabeled disks in the translation model, Abellanas et al. showed that 2n− 1 moves always suffice and ⌊8n/5⌋ moves are sometimes necessary for transforming the start configuration into the target configuration. Here we further improve the lower bound to ⌊5n/3⌋ − 1, and thereby give a partial answer to one of their open problems. (II) We show that the reconfiguration problem with congruent disks in the translation model is NP-hard, in both the labeled and unlabeled variants. This answers another open problem of Abellanas et al. (III) We also show that the reconfiguration problem with congruent disks in the sliding model is NP-hard, in both the labeled and unlabeled variants. (IV) For the reconfiguration with translations of n arbitrary labeled convex bodies in the plane, 2n moves are always sufficient and sometimes necessary.	computation;floppy disk;graph coloring	Adrian Dumitrescu;Minghui Jiang	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03367-4_23	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;convex body;computer science;mathematics;geometry;upper and lower bounds;algorithm	Theory	32.62730989166927	19.671580157496454	165106

We provide an algorithm for generating all combinatorial (nk)-configurations that admit a topological realization, for given n and k. This is done without enumerating first all combinatorial (nk)-configurations.

We show that for any such partition and any configuration T which is a vertex set of a nonequilateral triangle there is a copy of T contained in the interior of one of the two partition classes. Furthermore, we give the characterization of these “polygonal” partitions that avoid copies of a given equilateral triple. These results support a conjecture of Erdős, Graham, Montgomery, Rothschild, Spencer and Straus, which states that every two-coloring of the plane contains a monochromatic copy of any nonequilateral triple of points; on the other hand, we disprove a stronger conjecture by the same authors, by providing non-trivial examples of two-colorings that avoid a given equilateral triple.	erdős number;graham scan;graph coloring;monochrome;montgomery modular multiplication;piecewise linear continuation;vertex (graph theory)	Vít Jelínek;Jan Kyncl;Rudolf Stolar;Tomás Valla	2009	Combinatorica	10.1007/s00493-009-2291-y	combinatorics;topology;piecewise linear function;mathematics;geometry	Theory	33.39350788812821	24.14927691732894	167797

The modern theory of these ellipsoids is pioneered by Fritz John in his seminal 1948 paper. This paper has two, related goals. First, we investigate the symmetry properties of a convex body by studying its (affine) automorphism group Aut(K), and relate this group to the automorphism groups of its ellipsoids. We show that if Aut(K) is large enough, then the complexity of determining the ellipsoids CE(K) and IE(K) is greatly reduced, and in some cases, the ellipsoids can be determined explicitly. We then use this technique to compute the extremal ellipsoids associated with some classes of convex bodies that have important applications in convex optimization, namely when the convex body K is the part of a given ellipsoid between two parallel hyperplanes, and when K is a truncated second-order cone or an ellipsoidal cylinder.	convex optimization;convex set;cylinder seal;graph automorphism;mathematical optimization	Osman Güler;Filiz Gürtuna	2012	Optimization Methods and Software	10.1080/10556788.2011.626037	convex analysis;subderivative;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;convex optimization;convex combination;haar measure;mixed volume;convex body;linear matrix inequality;mathematics;geometry;convex set;proper convex function	ML	38.75509236317505	24.357550763375333	171457

We can have equality to zero iff i.e. if all the corresponding sides of the two polygons are parallel. (e, d) We must prove that the minimal polygon has at least one vertex on the boundary of the corresponding domain. In fact, consider a minimal polygon: there will be at least a couple of adjaeent noncollinear sides. The corresponding vertex must lie on the boundary, otherwise a shorter perimeter polygon could be found (see Figure 7 (a), (b)). Furthermore, from simple geometrical considerations it can be deduced that the normal to the boundary must bisect the angle between the two adjacent sides (Figure 7 (b)). Conversely, if a constraint is not active, i.e. a vertex is not on the boundary, the adjacent sides in the minimal polygon must be collinear. (e) From the convexity properties of the domain D and of the function f it can be deduced that: (i) all local minima are global; (ii) any convex linear combination of minima is a minimum as well; (iii) Jensen's relation (3) applied to two minima obviously holds with equality. We have proved in (b) that in our ease Jensen's relation holds with equality if and only if the corresponding sides of the two polygons are parallel. Now assume to have found a (global) minimum: any vertex between two noncollineax sides will satisfy the bisection property proved in (d). If no straight line segments axe present on the boundary of domain C (e.g. if domain C is a circle), it is not possible to translate two adjacent noncollinear sides still satisfying the bisection property. Therefore, all minimal polygons have the vertices between two noncollinear sides in the same position. Thus they differ only in the position of vertices corresponding to nonactive constraints: the minimal reduced polygon is unique. * The work forms part of a research program supported by the Bundesministerium fiir wissenschaftliche Forsehung and the Fritz ter Meer-Stiftung. c o m m e n t If a Laplace transform P(s) is given in the form of a real procedure, L/nv produces an approximate value Fa of the inverse F(t) at T.

Polygons which are k-convex can be triangulated with fast yet simple algorithms. However, recognizing them in general is a 3SUM-hard problem. We give a characterization of 2-convex polygons, a particularly interesting class, and show how to recognize them in O(n log n) time. A description of their shape is given as well, which leads to Erdős-Szekeres type results regarding subconfigurations of their vertex sets. Finally, we introduce the concept of generalized geometric permutations, and show that their number can be exponential in the number of 2-convex objects considered.	3sum;algorithm;erdős number;erdős–szekeres theorem;polygon triangulation;time complexity	Oswin Aichholzer;Franz Aurenhammer;Erik D.

Given a set of n point sites, the korder Voronoi diagram partitions the plane into several regions such that all points in a region share the same k nearest sites. The nearest-site (first-order) geodesic Voronoi diagram has already been well-studied, and its total complexity isO(n+c). On the other hand, Bae and Chwa [3] recently proved that the total complexity of the farthest-site ((n− 1)-order) geodesic Voronoi diagram and the number of faces in the diagram are Θ(nc) and Θ(nh), respectively. It is of high interest to know what happens between the first-order and the (n− 1)order geodesic Voronoi diagrams. In this paper we prove that the total complexity of the k-order geodesic Voronoi diagram is Θ(k(n − k) + kc), and the number of faces in the diagram is Θ(k(n− k)+ kh). Our results successfully explain the variation from the nearest-site to the farthest-site geodesic Voronoi diagrams, i.e., from k = 1 to k = n − 1, and also illustrate the formation of a disconnected Voronoi region, which does not occur in many commonly used distance metrics, such as the Euclidean, L1, and city metrics. We show that the k-order geodesic Voronoi diagram can be computed in O(k(n+c) log(n+c)) time using an iterative algorithm.	algorithm;distance (graph theory);euclidean distance;first-order predicate;first-order reduction;iterative method;output-sensitive algorithm;voronoi diagram	Chih-Hung Liu;D.

The quadrilateral coordinates of Tollefson alleviate this problem considerably for normal surfaces, by reducing the dimension of this vector space from 7n to 3n (where n is the complexity of the underlying triangulation). Here we develop an analogous theory for octagonal almost normal surfaces, using quadrilateral and octagon coordinates to reduce this dimension from 10n to 6n. As an application, we show that quadrilateral-octagon coordinates can be used exclusively in the streamlined 3-sphere recognition algorithm of Jaco, Rubinstein and Thompson, reducing experimental running times by factors of thousands. We also introduce joint coordinates, a system with only 3n dimensions for octagonal almost normal surfaces that has appealing geometric properties.

The group testing problem originated with the famous Dorfman’s blood testing problem and has since found many industrial applications including a recent one on multiple-access communication. Unfortunately, optimal group testing algorithms are not known in general. In particular, a very plausible conjecture that the expected number of tests should be nondecreasing in p for $0\leqq p < 1$ has remained open since 1981. In this paper we prove this conjecture by an innovative approach.		Y. C. Yao;Frank K. Hwang	1988	SIAM J.

The domain of the function is required to be a finite PLmanifold modeled by a simplicial complex. Given a starting point in such a domain, the resulting steepest descent path is represented by a sequence of segments terminating at a local minimum. Existing approaches for two and three dimensions define few ad-hoc procedures to calculate these segments within simplexes of dimension 1, 2 and 3. Unfortunately, in a dimension-independent setting this case-by-case approach is no longer applicable, and a generalized theory and a corresponding algorithm must be designed. In this paper, the calculation is based on the derivation of the analytical form of the hyperplane containing the simplex, independently of its dimension. Our prototype implementation demonstrates that the algorithm is efficient even for significantly complex domains.	algorithm;discretization;gradient descent;hoc (programming language);interpolation;linear function;maxima and minima;newman's lemma;phase diagram;prototype;sampling (signal processing);simplicial complex	Mattia Natali;Marco Attene;Giulio Ottonello	2013	Computers & Graphics	10.1016/j.cag.2013.05.003	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics;geometry;gradient	Graphics	32.544993415518256	18.409150039346265	177295

e5c438ed9b376bf8f517befe435cd5d5a7536502	a bijection for essentially 4-connected toroidal triangulations		Transversal structures (also known as regular edge labelings) are combinatorial structures defined over 4-connected plane triangulations with quadrangular outer-face. They have been intensively studied and used for many applications (drawing algorithm, random generation, enumeration. . . ). In this paper we introduce and study a generalization of these objects for the toroidal case. Contrary to what happens in the plane, the set of toroidal transversal structures of a given toroidal triangulation is partitioned into several distributive lattices. We exhibit a subset of toroidal transversal structures, called balanced, and show that it forms a single distributive lattice. Then, using the minimal element of the lattice, we are able to enumerate bijectively essentially 4-connected toroidal triangulations.	algorithm;delaunay triangulation;enumerated type;procedural generation;toroidal graph	Nicolas Bonichon;Benjamin Lévêque	2017	CoRR		bijection;distributive lattice;lattice (order);maximal element;topology;enumeration;distributive property;toroid;mathematics;transversal (geometry)	Theory	34.704340093174864	25.049192455436632	180223

As an application, we describe a fast new algorithms for computing the penetration distance along a direction between two arbitrary meshes. Penetration distance is important for computing collision response for rigid body dynamics solvers. Finally, we describe a simple way to find a good direction of penetration: the gradient of the penetration volume between the meshes. We give a simple algorithm to obtain this direction which requires only the intersection curve between the meshes.	algorithm;gradient;local interconnect network;sensor	Marek Teichmann;Zhaoheng Liu	2003		10.1145/965400.965443	rigid body dynamics;computer science	Robotics	34.314991910418826	19.230797741713783	182665

The geometric properties of the triangular mesh can be very different from the geometric properties of the smooth surface, even if both surfaces are very close from one another. In this paper, we give examples of """"developable"""" triangular meshes (the discrete Gaussian curvature is equal to 0 at each interior vertex) inscribed in a sphere (whose Gaussian curvature is equal to 1 at every point). However, if we make assumptions on the geometry of the triangular mesh, on the curvature of the smooth surface and on the Hausdorff distance between both surfaces, we get an estimate of several properties of the smooth surface in terms of the properties of the triangular mesh. In particular, we give explicit approximations of the normals and of the area of the smooth surface. Furthermore, if we suppose that the smooth surface is developable (i.e., """"isometric"""" to a surface of the plane), we give an explicit approximation of the """"unfolding"""" of this surface. Just notice that in some of our approximations, we do not suppose that the vertices of the triangular mesh belong to the smooth surface. Oddly, the upper bounds on the errors are better when triangles are right-angled (even if there are small angles): we do not need every angle of the triangular mesh to be quite large. We just need each triangle of the triangular mesh to contain at least one angle whose sine is large enough. Besides, approximations are better if the triangles of the triangular mesh are quite small where the smooth surface has a large curvature.

Given a point p = (a, b, c) in R, we define its dual plane as H (p) = ` (x, y) = ax + by − c, and given a plane π (x, y) = ax + by + c, we define its dual point as H (π) = (a, b,−c).

The topology is defined in terms of adjacency among binary components. Parallel local operations treated here are allowed to alter the topology only by deleting simply connected components. They also are required to annihilate all components except for the background. The window for these operations is 2 × 2, and is asymmetric with respect to the point whose value is to be calculated at the next step of operation. The group of operations are obtained by determining the necessary and sufficient conditions for a parallel operation to satisfy the quasi-preservation property thus defined. Some other considerations are also given.

(1) If the intersection curve of each pair of functions intersects each plane x = eonst in exactly one point and s = 1 (but not if s = 2) then ~r is at most O(n), and can be calculated in time O(n log n) by a method extending Shamos' algorithm for the calculation of planar Voronoi diagrams.

In order to show non-realizability of simplicial spheres, we extend the method of finding biquadratic final polynomials for matroid polytopes to partial matroid polytopes. Combining these two methods we obtain a complete classification of neighborly polytopes of dimension 4, 6 and 7 with 11 vertices, of neighborly 5-polytopes with 10 vertices, as well as a complete classification of simplicial 3-spheres with 10 vertices into polytopal and non-polytopal spheres. Surprisingly many of the realizable polytopes are also inscribable.	mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system	Moritz Firsching	2017	Math.

A similar result had been proved by Guibas et al. [8] for simple cycles in R. We prove that the result for cycles does not extend to R by giving two simple cycles, with corresponding edges parallel, that represent the same knot, and yet have no parallel morph.	cycle (graph theory);morphing;parallel redrawing	Therese C.

Our methods work best on sparse polynomials of high degree (in any number of variables) but are nevertheless completely general. The underlying ideas, which we take the time to describe without an excess of algebraic geometry terminology, come from tropical geometry. We then apply our methods to finding roots of n×n systems near a given query point, thereby reducing a hard algebraic problem to high-precision linear optimization. We prove new upper and lower complexity estimates along the way.

f6f2875ad7ffd65cce134fec548e2b0c2c97747e	ball packings with high chromatic numbers from strongly regular graphs	chromatic number;generalized quadrangles;ball packing;strongly regular graphs	Inspired by Bondarenko’s counter-example to Borsuk’s conjecture, we notice some strongly regular graphs that provide examples of ball packings whose chromatic numbers are significantly higher than the dimensions. In particular, from generalized quadrangles we obtain unit ball packings in dimension q3 − q2 + q with chromatic number q3 + 1, where q is a prime power. This improves the previous lower bound for the chromatic number of ball packings. 1. The problem and previous works A ball packing in d-dimensional Euclidean space is a collection of balls with disjoint interiors. The tangency graph of a ball packing takes the balls as vertices and the tangent pairs as edges. The chromatic number of a ball packing is defined as the chromatic number of its tangency graph. The Koebe–Andreev–Thurston disk packing theorem says that every planar graph is the tangency graph of a 2-dimensional ball packing. The following question is asked by Bagchi and Datta in [BD13] as a higher dimensional analogue of the four-colour theorem: Problem. What is the maximum chromatic number χ(d) over all the ball packings in dimension d? The authors gave d + 2 ≤ χ(d) as a lower bound since it is easy to construct d + 2 mutually tangent balls. By ordering the balls by size, the authors also argued that κ(d) + 1 is an upper bound, where κ(d) is the kissing number for dimension d. However, the case of d = 3 has already been investigated by Maehara [Mae07], who proved that 6 ≤ χ(3) ≤ 13. His construction for the lower bound uses a variation of Moser’s spindle, which is the tangency graph of an unit disk packing in dimension 2 with chromatic number 4, and the following lemma: Lemma. If there is a unit ball packing in dimension d with chromatic number χ, then there is a ball packing in dimension d+ 1 with chromatic number χ+ 2. The technique of Maehara [Mae07] can be easily generalized to higher dimensions and gives d+ 3 ≤ χ(d). Another progress is made by Cantwell in an answer on MathOverflow [Can], who proved that the graph of the halved 5-cube (also called the Clebsch graph) is the tangency graph of a 5dimensional unit ball packing with chromatic number 8. Then the Lemma implies that 10 ≤ χ(6). This argument can be generalized to higher dimensions using a result of Linial, Meshulam and Tarsi [LMT88, Theorem 4.1], and gave d+ 4 ≤ χ(d) for d = 2 − 2. As we have seen, both constructions study the chromatic number of unit ball packings and invoke the Lemma. We will do the same. A unit ball packing can be regarded as a set of points such that the minimum distance between pairs of points is at least 1, then the tangency graph of the packing is the unit-distance graph for these points. The finite version of the Borsuk conjecture can be formulated as follows: the chromatic number of the unit-distance graph for a set of points with maximum distance 1 is at most d+ 1. So the chromatic number problem for unit ball packings is the “opposite” of the Borsuk conjecture. By ordering the unit balls by height, we see that the chromatic number of a unit ball packing is at most one plus the one-side kissing number. 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 05C15, 05E30, 52C17.	ball project;contact graph;four color theorem;graph coloring;hard disk drive;mathematics subject classification;moser spindle;planar graph;set packing;strongly regular graph	Hao Chen	2017	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2017.03.006	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics	Theory	32.63929113174868	22.88054155181213	192477

When the square is equally likely to occur at any position, it is shown that the average and worst case numbers of nodes in the quadtree are both on the order of the region's perimeter plus the logarithm of the image's diameter.	quadtree	Charles R.

A tree can be straightened if all its edges can be aligned along a common straight line such that each edge points “away” from a designated leaf node. A polygon can be convexified if it can be reconfigured to a convex polygon. A lattice tree (resp. polygon) is a tree (resp. polygon) containing only edges from a square or cubic lattice. We first show that a 2D lattice chain or a 3D lattice tree can be straightened efficiently in O(n) moves and time, where n is the number of tree edges. We then show that a 2D lattice tree can be straightened efficiently in O(n) moves and time. Furthermore, we prove that a 2D lattice polygon or a 3D lattice polygon with simple shadow can be convexified efficiently in O(n) moves and time. Finally, we show that two special classes of diameter-4 trees in two dimensions can always be straightened.	algorithm;cubic function;lattice graph;net (polyhedron);tree (data structure)	Sheung-Hung Poon	2006		10.1007/11809678_21	internal and external angle;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;complex polygon;topology;integer lattice;simple polygon;computational geometry;rectilinear polygon;star-shaped polygon;polygon;carpenter's rule problem;mathematics;equiangular polygon;geometry;affine-regular polygon;monotone polygon;midpoint polygon;polygon covering;apothem;pick's theorem	Theory	32.97147100727702	19.79280855910071	196709

We also survey the different notions of sampling, used in computational geometry, learning, and other areas, and show how they relate to each other. We then give constructions of smaller-size relative (p, ε)-approximations for range spaces that involve points and halfspaces in two and higher dimensions. The planar construction is based on a new structure—spanning trees with small relative crossing number, which we believe to be of independent interest. Relative (p, ε)approximations arise in several geometric problems, such as approximate range counting, and we apply our new structures to obtain efficient solutions for approximate range counting in three dimensions. We also present a simple solution for the planar case.	approximation algorithm;computational geometry;counting problem (complexity);crossing number (graph theory);file spanning;graph coloring;sampling (signal processing);spanning tree;vc dimension	Sariel Har-Peled;Micha Sharir	2009	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;vc dimension;mathematics;computational geometry;sampling (statistics);geometry;upper and lower bounds;spanning tree;crossing number (graph theory)	Theory	33.83159577940317	20.085702880785107	197421

A new combinatorial tool in the form of a mathematical series, called a 0 series, is associated with an arrangement of hyperplanes in R d. It is used to study the combinatorial as well as algorithmic complexity of the geometric problems under consideration. 1. Statement of the Results In this section we state our results precisely. 1.1. Levels in Arrangements A level in an arrangement is a generalization of the extensively studied notion of a convex polytope. But the importance of levels in computational geometry extends well beyond this, mainly because several well-known problems regarding k-sets, higher Voronoi diagrams, half-space range queries can all be translated to problems concerning levels. Crudely speaking, a kth level in an arrangement of hyperplanes in R d is a polyhedral surface, such that each point on this surface is separated by roughly k hyperplanes from the origin. One simple method of constructing a level is to construct it, on an edge-by-edge basis, starting from a vertex on it. For d = 3 and d = 2 the cost per edge is O(x/~ log n), because of the external query results [10], but for d > 4 the only known method of constructing an edge is the obvious O(n)-time brute-force search, and this is quite inefficient. In this paper we give an efficient randomized algorithm for constructing levels of	analysis of algorithms;brute-force search;computation;computational complexity theory;computational geometry;convex function;k-set (geometry);polyhedron;randomized algorithm;range query (data structures);voronoi diagram	Ketan Mulmuley	1991	Discrete & Computational Geometry	10.1007/BF02574692	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;higher-order logic;topology;voronoi diagram;mathematics;geometry;arrangement of hyperplanes;randomized algorithm	Theory	32.03313691602282	19.902710253863003	198218

b2160149ea4931ac23c0f5928a563e3d6fb0aba5	computational lower bounds for colourful simplicial depth		The colourful simplicial depth problem in dimension d is to find a configuration of (d + 1) sets of (d + 1) points such that the origin is contained in the convex hull of each set (colour) but contained in a minimal number of colourful simplices generated by taking one point from each set. A construction attaining d 2 + 1 simplices is known, and is conjectured to be minimal. This has been confirmed up to d = 3, however the best known lower bound for d ≥ 4 is ⌈ (d+1) 2 2 ⌉. A promising method to improve this lower bound is to look at combinatorial oc-tahedral systems generated by such configurations. The difficulty to employing this approach is handling the many symmetric configurations that arise. We propose a table of invariants which exclude many of partial configurations, and use this to improve the lower bound in dimension 4.	algorithm;color;computation;convex hull;invariant (computer science);monochrome;vertex (graph theory)	Antoine Deza;Tamon Stephen;Feng Xie	2012	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;geometry	Theory	32.61049265019336	21.97150819181524	199070
