It has been shown that the existing algorithms almost achieve the sum capacity. However, the rate region does no longer feature a rectangular shape as for VDSL systems, that motivates the utilization of operating points suboptimal w.r.t. sum rate to meet the individual users demands. In these points, the gap between existing zero-forcing techniques and the corresponding weighted sum capacity is significantly larger. Therefore, we propose to improve the linear zero-forcing precoding by employing generalized inverses, for which we present methods that enable us to cope with the large system size of G.fast systems. Our simulations show that our proposed precoding scheme outperforms linear ZF solutions based on the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse significantly in scenarios with greatly varying user demands.	algorithm;digital subscriber line;moore–penrose pseudoinverse;nonlinear system;simulation;throughput;weight function;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Andreas Barthelme;Michael Joham;Rainer Strobel;Wolfgang Utschick	2017	2017 51st Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers	10.1109/ACSSC.2017.8335652	moore–penrose pseudoinverse;mathematical optimization;throughput;telecommunications link;precoding;g.fast;computer science;crosstalk;digital subscriber line;zero-forcing precoding	EDA	38.85607696862454	86.98169978680664	153937
46a9963db78f3e277e3c3622fcfb8a931d3a9759	cellular multiuser two-way relay network with cochannel interference and channel estimation error: performance analysis and optimization		"""In this paper, we study the impacts of cochannel interference (CCI) and channel estimation error (CEE) on the performance of a cellular multiuser two-way relay network. The network comprises of one <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$N_{a}$</tex-math></inline-formula>-antenna base station (BS), <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$M$</tex-math></inline-formula> single-antenna users, and one <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$L$</tex-math></inline-formula>-antenna relay with <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$N_{r}$</tex-math></inline-formula> number of interferers. In particular, by employing antenna selection at the relay, we propose beamforming and antenna selection transmission schemes at the BS with user scheduling in the presence of CEE and CCI. Then, we derive the tight closed-form lower bound expressions for the overall outage probability under Nakagami-<italic>m</italic> fading. We also deduce the asymptotic outage expressions in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime, from which the impacts of CEE and CCI on the achievable diversity order are highlighted. Moreover, using the asymptotic expressions, three optimization problems to minimize the outage probability are formulated and solved: first, optimal power allocation (OPA) with fixed relay location. Specifically, we develop two OPA approaches, namely, OPA I and OPA II. OPA I allocates the total power appropriately at each terminal, whereas OPA II allocates the fixed half of the total power at the relay and remaining power to base station and users; second, optimal relay location with fixed power allocation; and third, jointly optimal power allocation and relay location. Our results reveal that the OPA I outperforms OPA II, irrespective of different channel/system parameters, interferers, and relay locations. In addition, we demonstrate that the effect of interferers at the relay can be ignored if we allocate sufficient power to the base station and users. It is also shown that the CEE and CCI can severely degrade the outage performance, and even reduce the diversity order to zero. Further, it is highlighted that the impact of CCI can be alleviated by increasing the number of relay antennas. The numerical and simulation results validate our analytical findings, and also demonstrate that the antenna selection scheme offers comparable outage performance as beamforming scheme."""	beamforming;brainfuck;catastrophic interference;channel state information;controlled cryptographic item;downtime;elegant degradation;interference (communication);internet relay chat;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;multi-user;norm (social);numerical analysis;opa;pa-risc;portable document format;profiling (computer programming);scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sun outage	Mahendra K.

The basic idea is to split up the role of the transmit beamforming matrix according to the type of interference caused by each base station. It will be shown that, for a network of L base stations, the proposed method would result in achieving (L - 1) degrees of freedom per user and convert the multi-cell multi-user MIMO channel into a set of single-cell single-user MIMO channels. Finally, we derive the relationship between all the relevant network elements as Nt = (L - ds + 1)K'Nr + 1, where Nt and Nr are the numbers of transmit and receive antennas, respectively, L and ds denote the number of cells and the number of data streams transmitted from each base station, and K' is the number of users per cell defined under the proposed system model. Hence, we show that the proposed scheme makes it possible to implement interference alignment using less antenna resources.	algorithm;beamforming;csi-dos;interference (communication);multi-user mimo;simulation;telecommunications link;transmitter;x.690	Galymzhan Nauryzbayev;Emad Alsusa	2015	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2470252	3g mimo;electronic engineering;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;radio resource management;mathematics;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial multiplexing;precoding;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	38.275182388460685	83.81921847036539	155043

A secondary short-range wireless system with single/multi-hop unicast or broadcast ability is considered for the channel state information (CSI) dissemination. To reduce the CSI dissemination overhead, the relays are grouped in several independent clusters. Distributed diversity gain is attained at the destinations by applying phase rotations between clusters. The CSI dissemination is analyzed thoroughly, and compared with that of previous works on MU relaying. It is shown that for a given number of clusters and relays, the most uniform distribution of relays to clusters is optimum to minimize the CSI exchange traffic overhead and transmit energy consumption for CSI dissemination; besides it maximizes the average achievable rate for source/destination links. Furthermore, a new solution for a maxmin fairness based relay gain allocation is proposed and formulated as a semidefinite program.	channel state information;coherence (physics);fairness measure;minimax;multi-user;optimistic concurrency control;overhead (computing);relay;semidefinite programming;unicast	Celal Esli;Armin Wittneben	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.746	telecommunications;channel state information;uniform distribution;cooperative diversity;statistics;computer network	Visualization	35.72020740171131	85.06373579929333	155129

We propose a novel algorithm that jointly maximizes the OFDM-based cognitive radio system throughput and minimizes its transmit power, while guaranteeing a target bit error rate per subcarrier and restricting both co-channel interference (CCI) and adjacent channel interference (ACI) to existing primary users. Since estimating the instantaneous channel gains on the links between the SU transmitter and the PUs receivers is impractical, we assume only knowledge of the path loss on these links. Closed-form expressions are derived for the close-to-optimal bit and power distributions. Simulation results are described that illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme and show its closeness to that of an exhaustive search for the discrete optimal allocations. Further, the results quantify the violation ratio of both the CCI and ACI constraints at the PUs receivers due to the partial channel information. The effect of adding a fading margin to reduce the violation ratio is also studied.	algorithm;bit error rate;brute-force search;centrality;channel capacity;cognitive radio;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;simulation;subcarrier;throughput;transmitter;x.690	Ebrahim Bedeer;Octavia A.

Each transmitter is equipped with a finite battery to store the harvested energy, and a finite buffer to store the data that arrive during the communication session. We consider delay sensitive applications and maximize throughput while enabling timely delivery of data with delay constraints. We show that the resulting delay limited throughput maximization problem can be solved using alternating maximization of two decoupled problems termed the energy scheduling problem and the data scheduling problem. We solve the energy scheduling problem using a modified directional waterfilling algorithm with right permeable taps, water pumps, and overflow bins and the data scheduling problem with forward induction. Additionally, we identify the online optimum policy for throughput maximization. We provide numerical results to verify our analytical findings and to demonstrate the impact of the finite data buffer capacity and the delay requirements on the throughput. We observe that larger buffer sizes become useful for more lenient delay requirements, and a data buffer size that is comparable to the throughput within one time slot accounts for the majority of the increase in throughput.	data buffer;data storage tag;dynamic programming;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;network packet;numerical analysis;relay channel;requirement;scheduling (computing);session (computer science);throughput;transmitter	Burak Varan;Aylin Yener	2016	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2016.2545418	transmitter;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;energy harvesting	Metrics	32.68306334062757	85.64377332134247	156739
a0790e732d232408695bd923ac6bde2c426b3e44	adaptive wireless-powered relaying schemes with cooperative jamming for two-hop secure communication		"""A two-hop relay network is considered, in which an eavesdropper can overhear the relaying signal. To prevent the eavesdropper from decoding this signal, a destination transmits a jamming noise while a source transmits the data signal to the relay. At the same time, the relay can harvest energy from both the source signal and the jamming noise, and use this harvested energy to forward the received signal to the destination. In such a wireless-powered relay system with cooperative jamming, we propose two adaptive relaying schemes based on power splitting and time switching techniques. In the proposed power splitting-based relaying (PSR) and time switching-based relaying (TSR) schemes, the relay controls the power splitting ratio (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\rho }$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) and time switching ratio (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\alpha }$ </tex-math></inline-formula>), respectively, in order to achieve a balance between signal processing and energy harvesting. We find analytically the optimal values of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\rho }$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\alpha }$ </tex-math></inline-formula> in each scheme to maximize the secrecy capacity under the assumption of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Interestingly, although the eavesdropper’s channel state information (CSI) is used in the derivation of the optimal control parameters (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\rho }$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\alpha }$ </tex-math></inline-formula>), they are shown not to be affected by the eavesdropper’s CSI in a high SNR regime. This implies that the proposed schemes can be effective even for practical environments where there is no eavesdropper’s CSI. Furthermore, simulation results show that they well coincide with the exact solutions in practical environments even though the closed-form solutions are obtained with a high SNR assumption. Moreover, the comparisons of PSR and TSR in various scenarios show that the two relaying schemes have complementary performances depending on the network conditions. Specifically, PSR achieves greater secrecy capacity than TSR when the channel condition is unfavorable to the eavesdropper for wiretapping."""	channel state information;concave function;hop;information security;optimal control;performance;radio jamming;relay;secure communication;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software deployment;traffic sign recognition	Kisong Lee;Jun-Pyo Hong;Hyun-Ho Choi;Marco Levorato	2018	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2018.2830880	channel state information;computer network;hop (networking);computer science;decoding methods;signal processing;relay;control theory;secure communication;communication channel;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	34.75636755170352	83.07982724978227	156805

Firstly, by considering the direct link, an energy-efficient transmission scheme (EET) is proposed, which can be suitable for the resource-constrained devices and applications in IoT communication. Moreover, the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and secure energy efficiency (SEE) of different transmission strategies are derived, which contributes to the design of energy-efficient secure transmission. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that EET outperforms other transmission protocols in terms of SEE in most situations. To improve the secrecy performance and energy efficiency of the IoT deployment, EET can be adopted as an effective additional strategy in practical applications.

Multinode sensing is a technique being used in cognitive radio networks to enhance the sensing performance using space diversity concept. The challenges in multinode spectrum sensing are the prediction of signal status in multiple frequency bands in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and sensing reliability. The weighted gain combining (WGC) and the equal gain combining are the two soft decision cooperative sensing techniques being used frequently in literature. In this paper, we introduce weighted gain cooperative sensing using differential evolution (DE) and adjusted box-plot methods to exalt the sensing reliability together with the sensing performance. The main advantage of the WGC method using DE is that it can generate optimal weights independent of received signal characteristics, which is an indispensable condition to realize the system in real time. The proposed optimal cooperative sensing method with entropy and cyclic features enhances the sensing performance, and it is less severe to noise uncertainties compared with the traditional sensing methods. It can detect the low SNR signals up to -24 dB at desired sensing performance (Pf = 0.1 and Pd = 0.9) with a frame size of 256 and using five nodes in cooperation. It is a significant improvement for IEEE 802.22 WRAN systems, which work under low SNR regime.	algorithm;alternating bit protocol;cognitive radio;decibel;differential evolution;entropy (information theory);field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;frequency band;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;malware;real-time clock;security hacker;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Sesham Srinu;Samrat L.

d135e1a28aadc46f1abf576c60236a537222a41e	design for noma: combat eavesdropping and improve spectral efficiency in the two-user relay network		Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is important in 5G, and the users served in NOMA are often paired to avoid the excessive interference. However, for a two-user network, if the channel condition of one user is serious, this network may require the other user to relay this useru0027s signals. In this case, the demands of these users are possibly different. Specifically, the relay user may want the node to increase the spectral efficiency for compensating the cost of relay. On the other hand, because privacy information may be contained in signals, the indirect communication user may primarily focus on his or her information security. Therefore, we propose a novel physical layer scheme to satisfy these demands. Different from the existing relay schemes in NOMA, our scheme has the following characteristics: (i) through power allocation, the relay user can extract his or her signals with spectral efficiency improvement; (ii) through a signal-level method, the relay user can forward the indirect communication useru0027s signals, but he or she is difficult to learn the privacy information in these signals; (iii) through a mechanism, the indirect communication user can attain his or her privacy information. Our scheme is able to support the relay useru0027s demand, and this eavesdropping suppression in our scheme doe not depend on the complicated encryption techniques and positive secrecy rate.	coefficient;design of experiments;encryption;information security;interference (communication);international components for unicode;numerical analysis;relay;spectral efficiency;zero suppression	Datong Xu;Pinyi Ren;Qinghe Du;Li Sun;Yichen Wang	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254022	real-time computing;secrecy;computer network;information security;encryption;physical layer;computer science;spectral efficiency;communication channel;eavesdropping;relay	Mobile	35.27607281515317	83.61827685896081	158190

In this paper, an energy awareness optimal relay selection (EAORS) scheme is proposed, in which the number of optimal relays is determined by a weighted objective function considering energy consumption in both spectrum sensing and the cooperative transmission phases, under the constraints of the global misdetection requirement and secondary cooperative transmission bit error rate (BER). In the proposed EAORS scheme, we investigate the tradeoff between detection accuracy and energy efficiency and construct the objective function as a weighted convex function of relay numbers with the consideration of global missing detection probability and cooperative transmission BER. This nonlinear convex problem is solved by applying numerical analysis to obtain the optimal relay numbers. Energy consumption analysis is conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed EAORS scheme. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms a compressed sensing (CS)-based energy-efficient cooperative detection scheme and provides a tradeoff between detection accuracy and energy efficiency.	bit error rate;cognitive radio;compressed sensing;constraint algorithm;convex function;convex optimization;dirac comb;loss function;mathematical optimization;modulation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;optimization problem;overhead (computing);relay;requirement;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;x.690	Xiaorong Xu;Jianrong Bao;Haiyan Cao;Yu-Dong Yao;Sanqing Hu	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2389810	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;spectrum analyzer;telecommunications;numerical analysis;computer science;mathematics	Mobile	34.79476803755938	88.14251576774012	159325

Further, decentralized transceiver optimization of the relay nodes and users are developed to maximize the weighted sum rate. For the second proposed approach, we provide a novel structure of the precoding matrix of the base station.

c1c8093946d4c094711d75334807611aa0b2e9d5	physical layer security in af and cf relay networks with rf-energy harvesting		In this paper, we investigate the achievable secrecy rate in a relay channel where the source and the destination wish to keep the information confidential from an untrusted relay (potential eavesdropper). The relay has no energy supply, and harvests its required energy for relaying from its received signals. For radio-frequency (RF) Energy Harvesting (EH) at the relay, we adopt power splitting (PS) approach. We study the problem of achieving positive secrecy rates between the transmitter and the receiver while making use of an untrusted relay. Energy limitation at the relay makes the problem more interesting. Because, the relay must choose either to eavesdrop the signal to be able to decode or to harvest energy (from the information signal) to be able to forward the message. Our scheme to guarantee the secrecy uses cooperative jamming by either the destination or an extra jammer node. We derive the achievable secrecy rates for the compress-and-forward (CF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relays for two different scenarios. First, we assume the destination and the jammer are two separate nodes. Then, we consider destination-assisted jamming. In addition, we let the relay to use both the sources and the jammers transmitted signals to harvest energy. Our numerical results show that our proposed schemes guarantee a positive secrecy rate by properly locating the jammer and allocating enough jamming power. However, for a given power budget (i.e., fixed total transmission and jamming power) there is an optimum amount for the jamming power.	anisotropic filtering;confidentiality;cooperative multitasking;exponential hierarchy;inline linking;internet relay chat;numerical analysis;radio frequency;radio jamming;relay channel;secure communication;transmitter	Ali Soleimani;Mahtab Mirmohseni;Mohammad Reza Aref	2017	2017 14th International ISC (Iranian Society of Cryptology) Conference on Information Security and Cryptology (ISCISC)	10.1109/ISCISC.2017.8488378	energy supply;secrecy;computer security;physical layer;computer science;wireless;relay channel;transmitter;power budget;computer network;relay	Mobile	34.935040074339895	83.34906949758859	159802

The transmitter sends a common message to both users, a confidential message to User 1 and a private (non-confidential) message to User 2. The secrecy-capacity region is characterized by showing that certain inner and outer bounds coincide and that the boundary points are achieved by Gaussian inputs. The proof relies on factorization of upper concave envelopes and a variant of dirty-paper coding (DPC). The entire region is exhausted by using DPC to cancel out the signal of the non-confidential message at Receiver 1, making DPC against the signal of the confidential message unnecessary. The secrecy-capacity results are visualized using a numerical example.	anshel–anshel–goldfeld key exchange;concave function;confidentiality;deferred procedure call;mimo;numerical analysis;transmitter	Ziv Goldfeld;Haim H.

Our results demonstrate that separate optimization of relay location is more significant than that of power allocation to improve the overall system outage performance.

Therefore, for battery-powered terminals, energy efficiency represents a favorable metric in system design. One of the ways to improve the energy efficiency in CR is to optimize the fusion rule (FR) by which the individual results are processed. In this paper, we optimize the well known FR K-out-of-N for maximizing energy efficiency and detection accuracy. Mathematical expressions for the optimal N and K for both objectives are obtained. Simulation and analytical results show that significant improvement in energy efficiency can be achieved through FR optimization while satisfying a predefined threshold on the missed detection probability.	cognitive radio;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;network performance;optimizing compiler;simulation;systems design;whole earth 'lectronic link	Saud Althunibat;Marco Di Renzo;Fabrizio Granelli	2013	2013 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831303	throughput;cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;interference;cascading style sheets;computer network	Robotics	33.55614262140972	87.11926680891975	160405
fdae91976547a2a0cf9069eb8db0a7bab36084f4	joint energy harvesting and jamming design in secure communication of relay network		This paper investigates the secrecy performance of amplified-and-forward (AF) relay wiretap model by using energy harvesting (EH) and signal alignment technique. All nodes equipped with multi antennas play different roles in terms of source, destination, relay, eavesdropper and jamming node. The jamming node designs artificial noise based on signal alignment principle, and then transmits it to the eavesdropper with harvested energy. Due to different power limitations, we propose power allocation schemes called Local Power Constraints scheme (LPCS) and Global Power Constraints scheme (GPCS), which maximize the secrecy rate of the system and obtain better secrecy performance when compared with the non-EH scheme and the partial nodes power allocation EH scheme. Furthermore, we also analyze the effect of the energy harvesting on the secure degrees of freedom (SDOF) in the high signal-to-noise (SNR) region, and simulate the secrecy performance with convex optimization method by proving the convexity of the optimization problem. Results show that the proposed schemes outperform the compared schemes on the secrecy performance, and achieve more secrecy rate when the destination and the relay have more antennas.	anisotropic filtering;convex optimization;exponential hierarchy;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;radio jamming;relay;secure communication;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Ye Fan;Xuewen Liao;Zhenzhen Gao	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8253997	secrecy;computer network;computer science;convex optimization;jamming;secure communication;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;artificial noise;optimization problem	Mobile	34.8435106645866	83.69736803522812	160549

To deal with this uncertainty, this paper proposes a queue-aware distributed access scheme, in which each transmitter optimizes a transmission probability profile based on which it decides whether to transmit or to enqueue its packets over a series of time slots based on a statistical characterization of interference obtained through its past observations. To model the effect of unaligned interference, we propose a so-called L-measurement method, where interference is measured at multiple instants of time in each time slot to capture the effects of temporal uncertainty.  We present a mathematical formulation of the problem of dynamic transmission strategy optimization and propose an iterative distributed solution algorithm designed based on a best-response strategy. At each iteration, each node individually solves a nonconvex optimization problem of logarithmic complexity with the number of time slots jointly considered. The performance of the proposed distributed solution algorithm is evaluated by comparing it to two alternative distributed schemes and to the global optimum obtained through a newly-developed centralized globally optimal solution algorithm. Results indicate that considerable improvement in terms of sum-throughput can be achieved by the proposed distributed algorithm by jointly taking the queueing and multi-slot optimization into consideration.	access control;acoustic cryptanalysis;centralized computing;distributed algorithm;global optimization;interference (communication);iteration;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;optimization problem;software propagation;throughput;transmitter	Zhangyu Guan;Tommaso Melodia;Dongfeng Yuan	2012		10.1145/2398936.2398960	electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	32.87482572563878	86.35549343454305	160940

Both the circuitry power and the transmission power of all nodes are taken into consideration. In addition, three different coding schemes for two-way DF relaying strategy with two phases and two-way DF relaying with three phases are considered. The aim is to maximize the EE of the system for a constant spectral efficiency (SE). For this purpose, the transmission time and the transmission power of each node are optimized. Simulations are used to compare the EE---SE curve of different DF strategies with one-way and two-way amplify and forward (AF) strategies and direct transmission (DT), to find the best energy efficient strategy in different SE conditions. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that in low SE conditions, DF relaying strategies are more energy efficient compared to that of AF strategies and DT. However, in high SE conditions, the EE of two-way AF relaying and DT strategy outperform some of the DF relaying strategies. In simulations, the impact of different circuitry power and different channel conditions on the EE---SE curves are also investigated.	direction finding;mathematical optimization;one-way function	Mohammad Hossein Chinaei;Mohammad Javad Omidi;Jafar Kazemi;Foroogh S.

An approach that the source and the relay use some of their available power to transmit jamming signals in order to create interference at the eavesdropper is investigated. Assume that the relay and destination have an a priori knowledge of the jamming signals. A power allocation policy that defines how the available power is distributed between the message signal and that of the jamming signal is presented. The results show that the proposed approach can increase the secrecy level and that a positive secrecy rate can be achieved even when the eavesdropper may be near the source.

3dbba8f13791e1e04ba7da0123ac35371805149e	theoretical analysis of full-duplex system with power control		Full-duplex transceivers have the potential to double the wireless system spectral efficiency by enabling transmission and reception at the same time on the same frequency. However, full-duplex transceivers face the challenge of inter-user interference and the residual self-interference. Hence, it is not expected that full-duplex technology to enhance the system performance compared to half-duplex technology in all scenarios. In this paper, we provide theoretical analysis for the conditions under which the full-duplex system can outperform the performance of half-duplex systems in single-cell settings. Specifically, we first provide the uplink power control that enables gain in downlink full-duplex over downlink half-duplex. Then, based on the derived power control, we find the required self-interference cancellation at the base-station to achieve gain in the downlink and uplink full-duplex transmissions. Furthermore, given the uplink power control to improve the downlink rate, we show the scenarios where no gain can be achieved in uplink full-duplex over uplink half-duplex regardless of the achievable self-interference cancellation factor. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of full-duplex using the derived required power control and self-interference cancellation under different assumptions.	duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);rain fade;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;transceiver	Mohammed Al-Imari	2016	2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600948	power-flow study	Mobile	37.19008084157654	83.39108138852208	161854

In this paper, we consider a large-scale multi-cell MIMO where the number of users per cell K is proportional to that of base station antennas M. Both performances with and without pilot contamination are analyzed in a quantitative way with closed-form expressions. Unlike some existing works, we derive the result by coping with the fast fading explicitly, which makes our result far more accurate for moderate to large antenna numbers. From our derived results, it is found that the interference still exists when both M and K tend to infinity with a fixed ratio, and larger K/M results in a smaller performance degradation due to the pilot contamination in the multi-cell large-scale MIMO.	elegant degradation;expanded memory;interference (communication);mimo;matrix multiplication;multiplexing;performance;pilot ace;profiling (computer programming);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;stellar classification;telecommunications link;test-driven development	Xian Wu;Wei Xu	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6951952	3g mimo;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;control theory;spatial multiplexing	Networks	37.846531236220784	82.20120391850548	162835

We analyse the resulting energy efficiency taking into account the additional energy consumed by the overhead required to obtain channel state information, to select relay subset and to perform cooperative beamforming. We also study the impact of the number of cooperating relays, their location and different data packet length on energy efficiency. The simulation results show that for relays located close to the source the proposed scheme is more energy efficient than direct communication, conventional best relay selection, all relay selection and an existing cooperative relaying scheme. Moreover, through simulation it is revealed that increasing data packet length leads to significant energy savings.	beamforming;channel state information;multi-user mimo;network packet;overhead (computing);relay;simulation;timer	Bleron Klaiqi;Xiaoli Chu;Jie Zhang	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2015.7127498	telecommunications;cooperative diversity;relay channel;computer network	Mobile	32.58593866987964	84.29703221259267	163808

This study investigates the downlink performance of relay-assisted CoMP transmissions. The non-ideal transceiver scenario that considers the effects of hardware impairments on the performance of CoMP transmission is presented. The performance of relay-assisted CoMP transmission using a hybrid opportunistic cooperative (HOC) protocol is evaluated and compared for two different CoMP transmission strategies: coordinated beam-forming and joint processing (JP). For each strategy, the performance in terms of outage probability, average sum rate and throughput is studied. The non-COMP strategy is also included for comparison. Both theoretical and simulation results are considered to test the performance of ideal and practical scenarios of both CoMP transmission using HOC protocol and other relaying protocols such as amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols. The obtained results show that the HOC protocol with ideal scenario, significantly improves the average sum rate, the net throughput and the outage probability of CoMP transmission especially when considering the JP strategy. The obtained results also indicate that, the performance degradation due to non-ideal transceiver with HOC protocol is small when compared with AF and DF protocols.	profiling (computer programming);relay;transceiver	Emad S.

Cognitive radio designed with single purpose may not be suitable for the next generation of heterogeneous network, where there are multiple QoS requirements on application/user side, experiences a different kind of channel condition and must support different frequency band of transmission. So, there is a need for cognitive radio that will meet the multi-scenario requirements or context aware cognitive radio communication system for the heterogeneous network. This work presents five transmission mode cognitive waveforms for handle five different contexts. The five transmission waveforms are (1) Energy efficient QoS CR waveform using Genetic algorithm. (2) Low data rate FBMC based subcarrier level interleave CR waveform. (3) Emergency communication support underlay spatial coder waveform. (4) Hardware impairment handling waveform using prewhitened precoding. (5) Imperfect channel state handling adaptive training sequence design based interleave CR waveform. Optimal decision making based on observed values and receiver feedback relies on the accuracy level of observed values which is not a precise one. The fuzzy logic is tolerant of such impreciseness of data. So a cognitive engine deigns with fuzzy based decision system to select optimal waveform for the given context is presented. The system is designed to take input from spectrum hole from detecting unit and database, inputs from receiver feedback like BER, data rate, channel gain, channel imperfection, SINR from PR receiver, input from the transmitter about hardware impairment and finally input from user application about the QoS requirement.	cognition;cognitive radio;data rate units;decision support system;frequency band;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithm;modulation;next-generation network;quality of service;requirement;sensor;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;transmitter;uncompressed video;waveform;x.690;zero-forcing precoding	Ponnusamy Vijayakumar;S.

In this letter, we propose an energy-harvesting receiver for two-way orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under hostile jamming. More specifically, in the downlink, the receiver is designed to simultaneously process information and harvest energy from the received desired signal as well as the jamming interference through a power splitter. The harvested energy can then be used as an additional source of power to enhance the uplink transmission. We investigate the optimal power allocation and power splitting ratio to maximize the sum-rate of the uplink and downlink transmissions. To reduce the complexity, a suboptimal energy harvesting scheme with closed-form solution is proposed. We also obtain a lower bound on the sum-rate of the proposed scheme under strong full-band jamming.	demultiplexer (media file);elegant degradation;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency divider;interference (communication);multiplexing;power dividers and directional couplers;radio jamming;simulation;telecommunications link	Zhaoxi Fang;Tianlong Song;Tongtong Li	2015	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2014.2361717	telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer network	Mobile	37.25138083242054	86.87742809827984	165218

Specifically, we assume that a sensor node sends information signals to a base station (BS) and then the BS sends some processed signals to some mobile terminals (MTs). The objective is to minimize the total over-the-air transmission latency under stringent UL-DL reliability constraints and power limit. The achievable rate formula of finite blocklength codes is used to explicitly model the relation between the transmission rate, latency and reliability. While the formulated problem is difficult to solve, we explore the problem structure by analyzing monotonicity and convexity of the objective function with respect to system variables. Then we develop an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to solve the considered problem. Simulation results demonstrate interesting trade off between various system parameters and show that the proposed AO algorithm yields near-optimal solutions.	algorithm;ambient occlusion;code;convex function;ibm notes;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;requirement;sensor node;simulation;telecommunications link	Chao Shen;Tsung-Hui Chang;Hanqing Xu;Yajun Zhao	2018	2018 15th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2018.8491069	wireless network;real-time computing;monotonic function;latency (engineering);telecommunications link;sensor node;trade-off;computer science;convexity;base station	Mobile	32.821618214173576	87.84825403499451	165506
17e4c96770da0eb069439aa389b3b16995b10825	wireless transmission design with neural network for radio-frequency energy harvesting		Devices with the capability of radio-frequency energy harvesting can collect the radiated energy from adjacent wireless energy transmitters. If the multi-antenna transmitter knows the vector channel to the energy harvester, it can design an optimal transmit covariance matrix that satisfies the energy harvesting requirement. However, it is impractical for the energy harvester to estimate the channel. In this paper, we propose a method to design the wireless transmission with a neural network. The transmitter uses a set of special beam patterns and the energy harvester measures the received power and feeds the power values back to the transmitters. The neural network then takes in the power values and outputs the transmit covariance matrix that can meet the energy harvesting requirement. The neural network is trained offline with a large number of simulated data. Simulation results validate the proposed method and show better performance than other wireless energy transmission methods.	artificial neural network;bioinformatic harvester;online and offline;radio frequency;simulation;time complexity;transmitter;on-line system	Yuchen Qian;Yuan Xing;Liang Dong	2018	2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377410	computer network;electronic engineering;electric power transmission;transmitter;radio frequency;wireless;covariance matrix;energy harvesting;transmission (mechanics);communication channel;computer science	Mobile	32.562759291896995	86.93402522651905	166078

A key feature of NOMA is that users with better channel conditions have prior information about the messages of other users. This prior knowledge is fully exploited in this letter, where a cooperative NOMA scheme is proposed. The outage probability and diversity order achieved by this cooperative NOMA scheme are analyzed, and an approach based on user pairing is also proposed to reduce system complexity.	downtime	Zhiguo Ding;Mugen Peng;H.

The proposed transmitter represents a nonlinear one-to-one mapping between the transmitted data vector and the symbol vector. The transmitted data vector going through the base station antennas is obtained as a solution to the proposed convex error probability optimization problem that can be solved using computationally efficient interior point algorithms. It is proved that the proposed transmitter is always optimal unless the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is too low or the channel is nearly singular.

The main idea behind these schemes is that slight reduction in the prospected multiuser diversity gains is an acceptable trade-off for great savings in terms of required channel-state-information feedback messages. In this work, we characterize the achievable rate region of multiuser switched diversity systems and compare it with the rate region of full feedback multiuser diversity systems. We propose also a novel proportional fair multiuser switched-based scheduling scheme and we demonstrate that it can be optimized using a practical and distributed method to obtain the feedback thresholds. We finally demonstrate by numerical examples that switched-diversity scheduling schemes operate within 0.3 bits/sec/Hz from the ultimate network capacity of full feedback systems in Rayleigh fading conditions.	channel state information;crew scheduling;fairness measure;mathematical optimization;multi-user;numerical analysis;optimization mechanism;proportionally fair;rayleigh fading;real-time clock;requirement;scheduling (computing)	Mohammed Shaqfeh;Hussein M.

The transmitter has two independent messages, each of which is intended for one of the receivers but needs to be kept as secret as possible from the other. Recently, it has been proved that, under an input power-covariance constraint, the secret dirty paper coding (S-DPC) scheme is optimal, but under the average power constraint, there is not a computable secrecy capacity expression for the general MIMO case. In fact, for this case, the secrecy capacity region must in general be found through an exhaustive search over the set of all possible matrix power constraints. Clearly, this exhaustive search, as well as the complexity of dirty-paper encoding and decoding, motivates us to consider low complexity linear beamforming technique whose performance is close to the optimal S-DPC scheme. In this paper, we propose a GSVD-based beamforming scheme for the general MIMO broadcast channel with confidential messages. Moreover, an optimal power allocation is obtained to maximize the sum-secrecy rates for the GSVD-based beamforming technique, under the average power constraint. Numerical results are presented to illustrate that the secrecy rate region of the linear precoding approach is nearly identical to that of the optimal S-DPC scheme.	beamforming;brute-force search;computable function;confidentiality;deferred procedure call;mimo;numerical analysis;numerical method;singular value decomposition;transmitter	S.

The multiple antennas can also be utilized for WSDs to protect the DTT receivers and simultaneously increase the WSDs' system performance. However, due to the lack of channel information at the transmitter, conventional multiple-antenna-based cognitive radio (CR) techniques cannot be applied to WSD transceivers. In this paper, we develop the transmission strategies for multiple-antenna-based WSDs operating on the geolocation database framework. We analyze the achievable throughput when the WSD receiver exploits zero-forcing (ZF) linear processing under imperfect channel estimation and, based on the analytic results, propose a dynamic WSD transmission strategy in which the number of active transmit antennas and the associated antenna indexes are determined according to the WSD operational parameters obtained from the geolocation database.	algorithm;channel state information;cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;differential dynamic programming;geolocation;image scaling;mimo;mathematical optimization;maximum power transfer theorem;overhead (computing);simulation;system on a chip;terrestrial television;throughput;transceiver;transmitter;web services for devices;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Jung-Sun Um;Jaehyun Park;Joohwan Chun;Seungkeun Park	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2476816	transmitter;throughput;electronic engineering;digital television;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;channel state information;location;statistics	Mobile	39.171731879464886	82.39454772964518	167340

592057e40591e961a8978b0b5122393866c612ec	nash bargaining in beamforming games with quantized csi in two-user interference channels		In this paper, we consider a beamforming game of the transmitters in a two-user multiple-input single- output interference channel using limited feedback and investigate how each transmitter should find a strategy from the quantized channel state information (CSI). In the beamforming game, each transmitter (a player) tries to maximize the achievable rate (a payoff function) via a proper beamforming strategy. In our case, each transmitter's beamforming strategy is represented by a linear combining factor between the maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) and the zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming vectors, which is shown to be a Pareto optimal achieving strategy. With the perfect CSI, each transmitter can know the exact achievable rate region, and hence can find the beamforming strategy corresponding to any point in the achievable rate region. With limited feedback, however, the transmitters can only conjecture the achievable rate region from the quantized CSI, so their optimal strategies may not be optimal anymore. Considering the quantized CSI at the transmitter, we first find the Nash equilibrium in a non-cooperative game. Then, in a cooperative (Nash bargaining) game, we find a Nash bargaining solution and test its validity. Finally, we propose three bargaining solutions that improve the validity of the cooperation or the average Nash product. Our proposed bargaining solutions utilize the codebook structure; instead of each quantized channel itself, its Voronoi region is considered.	beamforming;channel state information;codebook;interference (communication);nash equilibrium;pareto efficiency;quantization (signal processing);system analysis;transmitter;voronoi diagram;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Jeong Hoon Lee;Huaiyu Dai	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417263	games;transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;precoding;wireless	Mobile	38.11345488536369	84.70617969118193	167560

Moreover, the results give insight into the optimal behavior of the proposed capacity-aware cooperative spectrum sensing based on noise power estimation regarding the common cooperative spectrum sensing parameters.	cascading style sheets;channel capacity;experiment;mathematical optimization;modal logic;noise power;optimal control;optimization problem;radio resource management;signal-to-noise ratio;superuser;vp/css	Valentin Rakovic;Daniel Denkovski;Vladimir Atanasovski;Petri Mähönen;Liljana Gavrilovska	2015	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2433297	estimation;electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;sensor;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;radio frequency;statistics	Mobile	34.42987502837536	87.08699999196517	167749

A malicious user tries to disturb the channel estimation process by sending interference symbols to the basestation (BS) via the uplink. Another legitimate user counters by sending random symbols. The BS does not possess any partial channel state information (CSI) and distribution of symbols sent by malicious user a priori. For such scenario, this paper aims to separate the channel directions from the legitimate and malicious users to the BS, respectively. A blind channel separation algorithm based on estimating the characteristic function of the distribution of the signal space vector is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides good channel separation performance in a typical massive MIMO system.	algorithm;channel state information;characteristic function (convex analysis);estimated;interference (communication);multi-user mimo;security hacker;simulation;spoofing attack;telecommunications link;visually impaired persons	Ruohan Cao;Tan F.

The conventional multiuser switched diversity scheduling scheme uses a single feedback threshold for every user, where the threshold is a function of the average signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the users as well as the number of users involved in the scheduling process. The proposed scheme, however, constructs a sequence of feedback thresholds instead of a single feedback threshold such that each user compares its channel quality with the corresponding feedback threshold in the sequence. Numerical and simulation results show that thanks to the flexibility of threshold selection, where a potentially different threshold can be used for each user, the proposed scheme provides a higher system capacity than that for the conventional scheme.	channel capacity;exptime;kleene's recursion theorem;multi-user;numerical method;recurrence relation;rewrite (programming);scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;social inequality	Haewoon Nam;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2010	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2010.05.090037	computer simulation;electronic engineering;real-time computing;voltage;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;engineering;base station;signal-to-noise ratio;scheduling;diversity combining;fading;statistics	Mobile	38.39098409907619	86.07976311276123	168037

However, the energy efficiency trade-offs of relay networks have not been thoroughly investigated using a more complete energy model of the system. In this paper we present an energy model for a cooperative dual-relay system using decode-and-forward (DF) protocol with receiver diversity. Energy consumption is based on models of both analog and digital components for transmission and reception. A quartic transmit power amplifier (PA) energy equation is derived that is a function of the following parameters: relay location, relative transmit power allocation amongst the relays, spectral efficiency, transmission distance, pathloss, and target bit-error rate (BER). The energies of the remaining circuit components are added to form a multi-relay DF system energy equation, which is then numerically evaluated to minimize total energy by finding the optimal relay locations, relay transmit PA power allocations, and spectral efficiency. Results are compared to our previous work that considered the energy of direct transmission and a single-relay system, and the minimum-energy system as a function of source-destination distance is considered.	adaptive histogram equalization;algebraic equation;analog signal;audio power amplifier;bit error rate;cooperative mimo;direction finding;energy systems language;energy modeling;lagrange multiplier;numerical analysis;optimizing compiler;point-to-point (telecommunications);polynomial;quartic function;relay;sextic equation;spectral efficiency;time complexity;transmitter;x.690	Dinuka Kudavithana;Qasim M.

Cooperative diversity can be applied to wireless sensor networks to significantly reduce node energy consumption. However, judicious selection and coordination of cooperation partners is essential to exploiting this energy saving potential of cooperation. In this paper we investigate optimal partner choice and power allocation for energy efficient cooperation in wireless sensor networks. Our insights lead us to formulate power allocation and partner choice heuristics which form a simple and practical cooperation strategy for energy-constrained wireless sensor networks, allowing nodes to autonomously make near-optimal cooperation decisions. We show that the power allocation optimisation problem is non-linear, necessitating the use of a search to find the optimum solution. We present the resulting cooperative energy savings in terms of network geometry for a range of potential partner locations. Our results reveal that the partner-destination and the source-partner channels have roughly equal influence over cooperation decisions for optimal energy efficiency. We use this observation to devise a simple yet near-optimal power allocation heuristic.	brute-force search;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;nonlinear system	Ljiljana Simic;Stevan M.

86149a80c9c43877deb796353da7792494b56997	optimized cooperative multiple access in industrial cognitive networks		We consider optimized cooperation in joint orthogonal multiple access and nonorthogonal multiple access in industrial cognitive networks, in which lots of devices may have to share spectrum and some devices (e.g., those for critical control devices) have higher transmission priority, known as primary users. We consider one secondary transmitter (less important devices) as a potential relay between a primary transmitter and receiver pair. The choice of cooperation scheme differs in terms of use cases. With decode-and-forward relaying, the channel between the primary and secondary users limits the achievable rates especially when it experiences poor channel conditions. To alleviate this problem, we apply analog network coding to directly combine the received primary message for relaying with the secondary message. We find achievable rate regions for these two schemes over Rayleigh fading channels. We then investigate an optimization problem jointly considering orthogonal multiple access and nonorthogonal multiple access, where the secondary rate is maximized under the constraint of maintaining the primary rate. We find both analytical solutions as well as solutions based on experiments through the time sharing strategy between the primary and secondary system and the transmit power allocation strategy at the secondary transmitter. We show the performance improvements of exploiting analog network coding and the impacts of cooperative schemes and user geometry on achievable rates and resource sharing strategies.	cognitive network;experiment;linear network coding;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;rayleigh fading;relay;terms of service;time-sharing;transmitter	Nan I.

In a realistic power constraint scenario, where each base-station has a limitation on the maximum power available power to be transmitted, the precoder filter can be analytically solved and this solution is provided. The simulated performance of the interference-aware filter in terms of achievable rates and MSE shows some advantages compared to other solutions in the literature designed with the aim of full interference cancellation such as block diagonalization schemes.	algorithmic efficiency;blu-ray;gaussian elimination;ici (programming language);interference (communication);mimo;maximum power transfer theorem;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;statistical interference;telecommunications link;throughput;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Felipe Llinares-López;Matilde Sánchez Fernández;Emilio Parrado-Hernández;Ana García Armada	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC)	10.1109/ICCW.2013.6649221	telecommunications;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;precoding;statistics	EDA	39.05828338576976	86.78261415802396	168645

We present a new exact closed-form expression of the SOP, and two kinds of asymptotic form of SOP are further derived to explicitly show secrecy performance. In addition, we show that the SOP can be reduced by increasing the number of relays through analysis and simulation results.

To characterize the performance, we develop a mathematical analysis framework for instantaneous and average secrecy rates. We consider the practical interference limited scenario, and derive exact closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function of the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR) at the destination and eavesdropper nodes. Accordingly, the asymptotic average secrecy rates are derived. We show that the proposed protocol improves the average secrecy rate of a wireless cooperative network substantially. However, the instantaneous secrecy rate performance gain is highly depend on the duration of energy harvesting, the amount of self-interference and the corresponding channels and positions of the nodes in the system.	duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);radio jamming;relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio	Zahra Mobini;Mohammadali Mohammadi;Chintha Tellambura	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)	10.1109/ICCW.2017.7962843	secrecy;duplex (telecommunications);computer network;wireless network;jamming;real-time computing;computer science;energy harvesting;wireless;relay;communication channel	Mobile	34.87685932494971	81.68824452703993	168684

Since these cooperative communication systems use cooperative relays with diverse fading coefficients to transmit information, having all relays participate in cooperative communication may result in unnecessary waste of resources, and thus relay selection schemes are required to efficiently use wireless resources. In this paper, we propose an efficient relay selection scheme through self-learning in cooperative wireless networks using Q-learning algorithm. In this scheme, we define states, actions and a reward to achieve good SER (Symbol Error Rate) performance, while selecting a small number of cooperative relays. When these parameters are well-defined, we can obtain good performance. The simulation results show that, compared to a scheme that obtains optimum numbers of relays through a mathematical analysis, the proposed scheme uses resources efficiently by using smaller numbers of relays with comparable SER performance. In particular, whereas the number of cooperative relays linearly increases as the number of relays that can participate increases in the case of the scheme modeled by a mathematical analysis, the proposed scheme selects 2.5 relays on average for cooperative communication. According to these simulation results, the proposed scheme can be considered as a good attempt for future communication.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;coefficient;cooperative mimo;dbpedia;emoticon;multi-user mimo;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;q-learning;relay;simulation	Honggyu Jung;Kwang-Yul Kim;Junsu Kim;Oh-Soon Shin;Yoan Shin	2012	2012 18th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2012.6388091	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;cooperative diversity;communication	Mobile	35.38301024988491	86.66914027569183	169251

In the hybrid paradigm, the secondary network cycles through the interweave or the underlay paradigms depending on whether spectrum holes are detected or the primary network is active, respectively. The outdated CSI is described via a correlation model, and the interference outage probability constraint (IOPC) and the average interference power constraint are considered. In general, determining the boundary of this region is a nonconvex problem. To navigate around solving this nonconvex problem, we replace the IOPC with its equivalent constraint on the peak transmit power, and we propose a power allocation algorithm for solving the latter problem. Simulations show that utilizing the outdated CSI of the interference channel reduces the secondary network's capacity as compared with when the current CSI is utilized. This reduction is a function of the correlation between the current and outdated CSI values, the interference outage probability in the primary network, and imperfect spectrum sensing.	algorithm;coefficient;computer simulation;downtime;increment and decrement operators;interference (communication);multi-user;programming paradigm;sun outage;telecommunications link;transmitter	Mohsen Jazaie;Ahmad R.

A simple time-switching protocol with a time-switching ratio <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\alpha $ </tex-math></inline-formula> is used to supply power for the energy-constrained legitimate transmitter. To improve the physical layer security, we first propose a protocol that combines maximum ratio transmission with zero-forcing (ZF) jamming for the case without Eve’s channel state information (CSI), i.e., Alice has access to Bob’s CSI only. Then, we propose a protocol that uses a ZF transmitting strategy to minimize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at Eve for the case that Alice is capable of obtaining partial CSI related to Eve. Closed-form expressions and simple approximations of the connection outage probability and secrecy outage probability are derived for both protocols. Furthermore, the secrecy throughput as well as the diversity orders achieved by our proposed protocols are characterized, and the optimal time-switching ratio <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\alpha $ </tex-math></inline-formula> and power allocation coefficient <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\beta $ </tex-math></inline-formula> for secrecy throughput maximization are derived in the high SNR regime.

In this paper, downlink secure transmission in two-cell base station cooperation multiuser network is studied. The two base stations are fully cooperated and an artificial noise (AN) is added to degrade the eavesdropper(EVE)'s channel. Perfect channel state information (CSI) of all users is known by the base stations and regularized channel inversion (RCI) precoding is used. The close form expression of secrecy sum rate is derived in the large system regime. The regularization parameter and the power allocation ratio are optimized based on larger system regime results. From analysis, base station cooperation network could serve more users per cell in secure transmission than single cell network. The numerical results show large system regime results are accurate even in finite case. In the simulation figures, the analytical optimal results can well approximate to the simulation results.	approximation algorithm;channel state information;multi-user;numerical analysis;secure transmission;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link	Xidong Mu;Li Guo;Chao Dong	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925741	telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	36.85583265358831	85.0826821218245	170943

By deploying SM in downlink multi-user (DL-MU) scenarios, conventional orthogonal multiple access-based SM (OMA-SM) allocates exclusive time-frequency resources to users, but suffers from low spectral efficiency. TA grouping-based SM (TAG-SM) divides TAs into sub-groups to serve different users independently, but suffers from severe inter-user interference. By introducing non-OMA (NOMA) into SM for DL-MU transmission, NOMA-based SM (NOMA-SM) is proposed to mitigate inter-user interference, while maintaining high spectral efficiency. Specifically, by applying successive interference cancellation at user side, the inter-user interference could be effectively eliminated with the sacrifice of increased computational complexity. Afterward, based on a symbol error rate analysis, a low-complexity power allocation scheme is provided to achieve high spectral efficiency through power domain multiplexing. When considering near-far effect from user distribution, user pairing issue is also discussed. Numerical simulation compares NOMA-SM with OMA-SM and TAG-SM, and verifies the effectiveness of the proposed low-complexity power allocation and user pairing methodologies.	computational complexity theory;interference (communication);mimo;modulation;multi-user;multiplexing;oma;power domains;simulation;spatial reference system;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Xudong Zhu;Zhaocheng Wang;Jianfei Cao	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2688019	cellular network;time–frequency analysis;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;interference;quantum mechanics;statistics;mimo	Mobile	38.05383467070413	85.7684292753111	171279
8de71f5f32321c43a60533eaefd2581dad5439df	optimal relay selection and power control for energy-harvesting wireless relay networks		Ambient energy harvesting (EH) has emerged as a promising technique to improve the energy efficiency and reduce the total greenhouse gas emissions for green relay networks. In this paper, we study the joint relay selection and power control problem for the decode-and-forward EH wireless relay network. In particular, the problem formulation is to maximize the end-to-end system throughput by a deadline under the limitations of data and energy storage. To solve the problem under an offline optimization framework, we decompose such an optimization problem into two subproblems: 1) the joint time scheduling and power control subproblem and 2) the relay selection subproblem. Due to the convex nature of the joint time scheduling and power control subproblem, we derive the optimal solution via the primal decomposition. Based on the obtained system throughput, we can quickly select the best relay that achieves the maximum throughput. For the practical implementation, we further design the sub-optimal online joint time scheduling and power control algorithm. Specifically, the best relay is first obtained based on the statistical knowledge of energy arrivals and channel states, and then the best relay decides the time scheduling and power control that maximizes the total throughput according to the instantaneous state of channel fading, energy arrival, and queue data in each time slot. Simulation results show that the proposed offline algorithm can guarantee the maximum system throughput. Moreover, the simulation results show that compared to the optimal offline algorithm, the sub-optimal online algorithm suffers only a small degradation in performance.	computational complexity theory;direction finding;elegant degradation;end system;end-to-end encryption;exponential hierarchy;mathematical optimization;maximum throughput scheduling;multi-source;numerical analysis;online algorithm;online and offline;optimization problem;relay;scheduling (computing);selection algorithm;simulation	Yuan Wu;Li ping Qian;Xuemin Shen	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7997145	fading;real-time computing;online algorithm;throughput;power control;scheduling (computing);computer science;optimization problem;relay;communication channel	Mobile	32.81187520373719	87.40457299073032	171542

The throughput criteria within the sophisticated precoding strategy is addressed for PM and BM designs in the considered communication scheme, and we show that this problem is non-linear non-convex and the optimal solutions remain unsolved. In order to find an efficient solution, we first convert it into a series of tractable subproblems, and then an iterative design algorithm is proposed based on alternative optimization, which can obtain the optimal matrices for BS and RS.

Furthermore, the trend of the sum rate of the network well coincides with the analysis of DoF, which verifies our work.	align (company);channel state information;expanded memory;interference (communication);mimo;telecommunications link;the semware editor (tse);time-sharing;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Liyu Xu;Xuewen Liao;Zhenzhen Gao;Jingke Wan	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504115	transmitter;electronic engineering;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;base station;control theory;interference;co-channel interference;statistics;mimo	Mobile	38.721112906329004	84.69857980524014	172685

Since the ultimate goal of a WMN is to provide Internet connectivity to residential clients, WMN traffic is mainly routed over the backbone either toward the Internet gateways (IGWs) or from the IGWs to the APs. In principle, the transport capacity of a WMN can further be upgraded by equipping the underlying backbone routers with multiantenna (MA) radio modules. Motivated by the above consideration, in this paper, we focus on the optimized node selection (e.g., path-routing) over MA mesh backbones when the target is to maximize the end-to-end routed information rate subject to a constraint on the total power available for the relays. Under the assumption of Rayleigh-distributed block fading, we assume that point-to-point capacity-achieving space-time codes (STCs) are used for the single-hop link. At first, we tackle the routing problem when neither interference mitigation (IM) nor transmit beamforming (TB) is performed at the relay nodes, and then, we extend the analysis to the cases when IM and/or TB are also carried out. The effects of channel-state-information (CSI) possibly available at the relay nodes are also investigated. So doing, we are able to gain insight about the combined effect of spatial multiplexing and IM capabilities of the overall MA architecture on both end-to-end capacity and access medium performance of the considered WMN.	access control;battle.net;beamforming;care-of address;channel state information;code;emoticon;end-to-end principle;expanded memory;integer programming;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);internet relay chat;internet backbone;mimo;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;noise reduction;numerical recipes;point-to-point protocol;programming paradigm;rayleigh–ritz method;routing;spatial multiplexing;spectral efficiency;terabyte;wireless access point;wireless mesh network	Enzo Baccarelli;Mauro Biagi;Cristian Pelizzoni;Nicola Cordeschi	2009	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2008.171	wireless mesh network;routing;the internet;spine;telecommunications;point-to-point;social connectedness;computer science;rayleigh fading;wireless network;signal processing;noise reduction;channel state information;estimation theory;beamforming;space–time code;spatial multiplexing;fading;channel capacity;statistics;computer network	Mobile	32.131555671727966	82.99674107341177	173298
1c945d977821f803c389dc2d10037a2bfeb60b15	nonadaptive transmission for slow fading misose wiretap channel with adjustable power allocation		This paper proposes a new nonadaptive (NADP) transmission scheme with adjustable power allocation based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the main channel for the multiple-input-single-output-single-eavesdropper (MISOSE) system. With the assistance of the adjustable power allocation ratio, we can improve the secure transmission performance under the constraints of secrecy outage probability (SOP) and upper bound rate (UBR). To verify the superiority of our new approach, we consider the multi-antenna communication systems with NADP scheme and give the optimal solution for achieving the maximum secrecy throughput based on a two-dimensional (2-D) searching method. In addition, a good suboptimal solution is also provided to reduce the time complexity of the optimal solution. Simulation results are provided and confirm that the proposed NADP scheme has significant advantages over the existing work especially when the transmit power is high.	channel state information;downtime;mimo;numerical analysis;secure transmission;simulation;throughput;time complexity;upwind scheme	Zongze Li;Pengcheng Mu;Zongmian Li;Hui-Ming Wang;Weile Zhang;Tong-Xing Zheng	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254422	communications system;real-time computing;secure transmission;transmitter power output;time complexity;channel state information;throughput;fading;computer science;communication channel	Mobile	36.09796576720318	82.61970929017139	173383

In contrast to previous SWIPT systems based on the information rate, this paper addresses the problem in terms of the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) criterion. First, we formulate the WMMSE-SWIPT problem which minimizes the weighted sum-MSE of the message signal arrived at the ID user, while satisfying the requirement on the energy that can be harvested from the signal at the EH user. Then, we propose the optimal precoder structure of the problem and identify the best possible MSE-energy tradeoff region through the alternative update of the linear precoder at the transmitter with the linear receiver at the ID user. From the derived solution, several interesting observations are made compared to the conventional SWIPT designs.	exception handling;exponential hierarchy;mimo;mean squared error;transmitter;weight function	Chang-Ick Song;Cong Ling;Jaehyun Park;Bruno Clerckx	2014	2014 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2014.7063588	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	37.02930398589196	87.20021410785318	174231

In this work, we extend the distributed selection cooperation protocol with feedback to multisource multidestination cooperative networks and investigate the best relay confliction problem existing in the scenario. In the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, due to the fact that sharing the same best relay by multiple source nodes has no influence on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) performance for each communication pair, the single relay sharing method is a simple and effective solution. For some practical systems with low or medium SNR, we propose two power allocation algorithms for the shared best relay and show that the method based on maximizing the number of successful relay flows is efficient in distributed scenarios with low complexity.	algorithm;digital monetary trust;memory management;multiplexing;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Heng Wang;Shizhong Yang;Jinzhao Lin;Yuanhong Zhong	2010	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2010.2085043	telecommunications;computer science;resource management;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	DB	37.68349786723244	87.36098096729738	174371

Due to the complexity of wireless environment and the primary user's location is unknown, the sensing performance will be affected by many unfavorable factors such as multipath fading, shadowing, and so on. Especially, some secondary users (SUs), defined as attackers, could cause security problem by reporting false information to other SUs. In this paper, we proposed a Dynamic Suspicious Reputation Scheme to detect attackers in collaborative sensing. In the proposed scheme, a SU with suspicious reputation makes the sensing decision by evaluating the correlation value between its own sensing reports and those from other SUs. If the correlation value exceed a given threshold, the compared SU is regarded as an attacker. The suspicious reputation is updated according to its own sensing reports in each collaborative sensing iteration. Once the suspicious reputation of a SU exceed a certain threshold, the SU is regarded as Malicious Attacker, and removed out the collaborative sensing group. Numerical analysis show that the proposed scheme can achieve a considerable performance improvement compared with a User-centric Misbehavior Detection Scheme for secure collaborative sensing. In addition, we also discuss the affection of the suspicious reputation to the probability of false alarm and detection.	ansi escape code;cognitive radio;interference (communication);iteration;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;simulation;superuser	Xiaoge Huang;Yongxu Zou;Bin Shen;Qianbin Chen	2014	2014 14th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2014.7011881	telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Mobile	35.01995340893316	84.16145093380837	175267

However, it is usually assumed that there exists orthogonal channels for the cognitive users to send the detection information to the decision center, which is not realistic. In this paper, we consider a practical scenario in which there is a random access channel shared by different cognitive radio users. We then propose a two-threshold opportunistic feedback scheme to judiciously select some cognitive users who have much confidence in the spectrum sensing decision to share the random access channel. The thresholds are determined to maximize the detection probability while keeping the collision of the random access as minimal. The analytical results of the distributed spectrum sensing with the proposed opportunistic feedback are derived. Numerical results show that the proposed opportunistic feedback scheme in distributive spectrum sensing is superior to the conventional cooperative spectrum sensing where the orthogonal access channels are applied.	algorithm;cognitive radio;feedback;multi-user;numerical analysis;random access	Wei Zhang;Zhu Han	2010	2010 IEEE Wireless Communication and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2010.5506759	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;mobile computing;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	34.950721091759746	84.4155796033878	176148

We derive the average normalized MSE and the individual MSEs of users. At first, we optimize the average normalized MSE with respect to the transmit covariance matrices of the users. Next, adaptive power allocation is applied to further minimize the average normalized MSE. This leads to the general average normalized MSE optimization under a sum power constraint. We analyze the optimization problems and their connections by their Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The covariance matrix optimization is solved by iteratively single-user average MSE optimization in which the interference is treated as noise. We develop an iterative algorithm that performs power allocation and covariance matrix optimization. In addition to this, we study the achievable MSE region. We show that the MSE region is convex for the two-user MIMO case. Furthermore, we characterize the optimum power allocation among the users with regard to the single-user range. We show that the user with the maximum singular value of its channel matrix is the first supported user. For low SNR values, the optimal strategy is to have the best user transmitting only. In addition, we derive the individual MSE using single-user MMSE detectors and study the fulfillment of MSE requirements.	mimo;mathematical optimization	Eduard Axel Jorswieck;Holger Boche	2003	IEEE Trans.

Different from traditional strategies in relay systems, which would halt the communication if the relay could not decode the signal successfully, we propose a robust secure transmission strategy which switches between cooperative jamming and decoded-and-forward. Our objective is to maximize secrecy rate, given the unavailability of the perfect eavesdropper channel state information, we propose a worst-case robust design based on secrecy rate. In addition, a traditional robust scheme and a non-robust scheme are put forward as benchmarks. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme based on robust designs can achieve significant security performance gains over other approaches. More interestingly, because of the influence of cooperative jamming, the security performance of non-robust scheme outperforms the traditional robust designs in low transmit power and low channel error coefficient regions.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);best, worst and average case;channel state information;coefficient;direction finding;etsi satellite digital radio;halting problem;network switch;radio jamming;relay;secure transmission;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;unavailability;writing commons	Zhi Lin;Lei Wang;Yueming Cai;Weiwei Yang;Wendong Yang	2015	2015 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2015.7341319	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;relay channel;computer network	Mobile	35.78934832667493	83.39607375246455	176758

It has been shown that these criteria belong to a set of reasonable Schur-concave or Schur-convex objective functions of the diagonal entries of the system mean-square error (MSE) matrix. In this paper, assuming only the knowledge of channel mean and transmit correlation at both ends, a general theoretical framework is presented to derive the optimum precoder and decoder for MIMO systems using these objective functions. It is shown that for all these objective functions the optimum transceivers share a similar structure. Compared to the case with perfect CSI, a linear filter is added to both ends to balance the suppression of channel noise and the additional noise induced from channel estimation error.

The techniques of NOMA and CR have improved the spectrum efficiency greatly in the traditional networks. Because of the difference in principles of spectrum improving, NOMA and CR can be combined together, i.e. CR NOMA network, and have great potential to improving the spectrum efficiency. However the physical layer security in CR NOMA network is different from any single network of NOMA or CR. We will study the physical layer security in underlay CR NOMA network. Firstly, the wiretap network model is constructed according to the technical characteristics of NOMA and CR. In addition, new exact and asymptotic expressions of the security outage probability are derived and been confirmed by simulation.

9d5af4a9f373c65407e0c8feb802bdc7ddcd31f1	secure transmit antenna selection protocol for mimo noma networks over nakagami-m channels		In this paper, we studied a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network consisting of one source and two legitimate users (LUs), so-called near and far users according to their distances to the source, and one passive eavesdropper, over Nakagami-m fading channel. Specifically, we investigated the scenario that the signals of the far user might or might not be decoded successfully at the eavesdropper and the near user. Thus, we aimed at designing a transmit antenna selection (TAS) secure communication protocol for the network. Then, two TAS solutions, namely Solutions I and II, were proposed. Specifically, solutions I and II focus on maximizing the received signal power between the source and the near user, and between the source and the far user, respectively. Accordingly, the exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability for the LUs and the overall system were derived. Our analytical results corroborated by Monte Carlo simulation indicate that the secrecy performance could be significantly improved by properly selecting power allocation coefficients and increasing the number of antennas at the source and the LUs. Interestingly, solution II could provide a better overall secrecy performance over solution I.	approximation;binary prefix;clenshaw–curtis quadrature;code;coefficient;communications protocol;downtime;emoticon;filezilla client;mimo;monte carlo method;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;pictbridge;rewrite (programming);secure communication;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;thermal-assisted switching	Duc-Dung Tran;Ha-Vu Tran;Dac-Binh Ha;Georges Kaddoum	2018	CoRR		secrecy;computer network;mimo;fading;monte carlo method;expression (mathematics);computer science;secure communication;nakagami distribution;communication channel	Mobile	35.61159201562456	82.08365837010513	177561

This paper presents an analytical framework to compare the performance of two resource allocation schemes, using CSI-based and random sub-carrier selection, in terms of their user outage probability and throughput in relation to the system load in frequency-selective fading and interference-limited environments. Analytical and simulation results are in good agreement and indicate that a proper use of CSI can achieve substantially better performance in interference limited cellular systems as compared to the blind approach and thus show the benefits of multi-user diversity.	ati radeon r200 series;algorithm;channel state information;downtime;exptime;interference (communication);load (computing);memory management;multi-user;multiplexing;randomness;real-time clock;reversing: secrets of reverse engineering;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;throughput	Navid Damji;Tho Le-Ngoc	2011	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-010-0029-1	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;channel state information;statistics;computer network	Metrics	31.91145962600042	88.42527784204508	177598

It is assumed that the transmitter can perform power adaptation under peak and average power constraints based on the channel state information fed back by the receiver. Using results from measure theory and convex analysis, it is shown that this optimization problem, which is in general nonconvex, has an equivalent Lagrangian dual that admits no duality gap and can be solved using dual decomposition. Efficient numerical algorithms are proposed to determine the optimal power allocation scheme under peak and average power constraints. Furthermore, the continuity and monotonicity properties of the corresponding optimal power allocation scheme are characterized with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio for any given value of the false alarm probability. Simulation examples are presented to corroborate the theoretical results and illustrate the performance improvements due to the proposed optimal power allocation strategy.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;channel state information;convex analysis;duality gap;lagrange multiplier;lagrangian relaxation;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;scott continuity;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Serkan Saritas;Berkan Dulek;Ahmet Dundar Sezer;Sinan Gezici;Serdar Yüksel	2017	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2016.2634552	mathematical optimization;transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;control theory;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio	Metrics	35.62910340857616	88.24332842536735	178548

Recently, the use of the timing channel has been proposed as a countermeasure to reactive jamming attacks performed by an energy-constrained malicious node. In fact, while a jammer is able to disrupt the information contained in the attacked packets, timing information cannot be jammed, and therefore, timing channels can be exploited to deliver information to the receiver even on a jammed channel. Since the nodes under attack and the jammer have conflicting interests, their interactions can be modeled by means of game theory. Accordingly, in this paper, a game-theoretic model of the interactions between nodes exploiting the timing channel to achieve resilience to jamming attacks and a jammer is derived and analyzed. More specifically, the Nash equilibrium is studied in terms of existence, uniqueness, and convergence under best response dynamics. Furthermore, the case in which the communication nodes set their strategy and the jammer reacts accordingly is modeled and analyzed as a Stackelberg game, by considering both perfect and imperfect knowledge of the jammer's utility function. Extensive numerical results are presented, showing the impact of network parameters on the system performance.	channel (communications);emoticon;frequency response;game theory;interaction;interference (communication);iteration;jacobian matrix and determinant;like button;nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;numerical method;radio jamming;sensor;timing channel;transmitter;universal quantification;utility	Salvatore D'Oro;Laura Galluccio;Giacomo Morabito;Sergio Palazzo;Lin Chen;Fabio Martignon	2015	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2014.2385709	games;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;nash equilibrium;wireless	Mobile	34.66883239186139	84.12582416921195	179111

We propose a simple relay selection scheme to improve wireless transmission security based on the instantaneous channel information of all legitimate users and the statistical information about the eavesdropper channels. The closed-form expressions of the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity and the secrecy outage probability (SOP) are derived over independent and non-identically distributed Rayleigh fading environments. Furthermore, we conduct the asymptotic analysis to evaluate the secrecy diversity order performance and prove that full diversity is achieved by using the proposed relay selection. Finally, numerical results are presented to verify the theoretical analysis and depict that primary interference constrain has a significant impact on the secure performance and a proper transmit power for the second transmitters is preferred to be energy-efficient and improve the secure performance.

We focus on the cache-aided Gaussian interference channel in the low-SNR regime. We propose a strategy that creates content overlaps at the transmitter caches to allow for co-operation between the transmitters. This co-operation yields a beamforming gain, which has to be traded off against a multicasting gain. We evaluate the performance of this strategy and show its approximate optimality in both the single-receiver case and the single-transmitter case.	approximation algorithm;beamforming;cache (computing);interference (communication);multicast;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Jad Hachem;Urs Niesen;Suhas N.

In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio frequency (RF) signals has drawn a lot of attention recently. In this paper, we apply simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) to a clustered sensor network such that a cluster head node harvests the wireless energy of received RF signals from its cluster members and then employs the harvested energy to compensate the energy consumed by data aggregating and forwarding. In such a network, how to achieve high energy efficiency through trading off between energy harvesting and information decoding is a critical issue. To this end, we formulate the rate and power resource allocation problem in a clustered WSN with SWIPT as a non-convex constrained energy efficiency maximization problem. By exploiting fractional programming and dual decomposition, we further propose a cross-layer resource allocation (ResAll) algorithm consisting of subalgorithms of rate control, power allocation and power splitting to solve the problem efficiently and optimally. Our simulation results reveal that the proposed ResAll algorithm converges within a small number of iterations, and achieves optimal system energy efficiency by balancing energy efficiency, data rate, transmit power and power splitting ratio.	criss-cross algorithm;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;fractional programming;iteration;lagrangian relaxation;radio frequency;simulation;uncompressed video	Songtao Guo;Chunrong He;Yuanyuan Yang	2015	2015 12th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)	10.1109/SAHCN.2015.7338292	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;energy harvesting;wireless;computer network	Mobile	33.35575470640785	87.69767742092965	179729
06c9b8fd1bf734b73a630dff8242556f3fe77375	energy efficient artificial fast fading for miso-ofdm systems		For secure wireless communications, physical layer security techniques, which degrade the received signal quality of the eavesdropper, are useful. Among the physical layer security techniques, an artificial fast fading (AFF) technique degrades the received signal quality of eavesdroppers by causing pseudo fast fading to the transmitting signals. This is realized by multiplying the signals to be transmitted by random weights every symbol interval. However, the AFF technique often increases the power of the weighted signals. In such cases, the weighted signals must be normalized before transmission. This causes energy loss in the legitimate receiver. Therefore, we consider minimizing the norm of the weight vector to prevent the power of the weighted signals from being increased. In this paper, we propose three energy efficient AFF generation schemes. In the first scheme, the phases of random weights are adjusted to minimize the norm of the non-random weight which is required to cancel AFF out at the legitimate receiver. In the second scheme, two or more non-random weights are used for minimizing the norm of the weight vector. The third proposed scheme is the combination of these two schemes. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes achieve higher ergodic mutual information as compared with the conventional AFF generation scheme.	automated flight following;ergodicity;mimo-ofdm;mutual information;randomness;simulation;system analysis;transmitter	Tomoki Akitaya;Takahiko Saba	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417411	transmitter;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;information security;frequency domain;physical layer	Mobile	35.6027399583924	83.8803419449883	180279

It is assumed that the eavesdropper’s (Eve’s) channel state information (CSI) is unknown to the transmitter (Alice) and legitimate receiver (Bob). Recent studies have shown that the achievable sdof in the sense of strong secrecy is zero when Eve’s number of antennas is equal to or more than Bob’s number of antennas, which is the scenario considered in this paper. To this end, we propose a novel precoding technique and a coding strategy that together achieve full sdof in the sense of strong secrecy without knowing Eve’s CSI and without using artificial noise. The proposed precoding method uses the CSI of the Alice-Bob channel in a nonlinear fashion, which makes the transmitted symbols undecodable at Eve. The proposed coding scheme is based on the channel resolvability concept and ensures strong secrecy. Achieving full sdof with an unknown Eve’s CSI is significant, because it is contrary to what is believed about the achievable sdof for the MISO wiretap channel in the sense of strong secrecy. We also show that the proposed scheme achieves near Alice-Bob’s channel capacity in the sense of strong secrecy with a probability approaching one at finite signal-to-noise ratio.	alice and bob;beamforming;binary logarithm;c4 engine;channel capacity;channel state information;eve;gaussian blur;hp 48 series;nonlinear system;p (complexity);scalability;signal-to-noise ratio;social inequality;strong secrecy;system analysis;transmitter;z1 (computer);z2 (computer)	Mohaned Chraiti;Ali Ghrayeb;Chadi M.

e8d6094685fb4965232a8e2863117fa445f00701	secure multi-antenna transmission in three-tier wireless sensor networks		This paper develops a tractable framework for exploiting the potential benefits of physical layer security in three-tier wireless sensor networks. In such networks, the sensing data from the remote sensors are collected by sinks with the help of access points, and the external eavesdroppers intercept the data transmissions. We adopt the stochastic geometry approach to model the random locations and spatial densities of the sensors, access points, sinks, and eavesdroppers. We focus on the secure transmission in two scenarios: i) the active sensors transmit their sensing data to the access points, and ii) the active access points forward the data to the sinks. We derive new compact expressions for the overall average secrecy rate in such networks. Numerical results corroborate our analysis and show that multiple- antenna technique at the access points can enhance the security. Our results show that the overall average secrecy rate first increases with increasing the number of access points, and there exists a critical value beyond which the overall average secrecy rate decreases with increasing the number of access points. When adding the number of active sensors, the overall average secrecy rate decreases. In contrast, increasing the number of sinks improves the overall average secrecy rate.	cobham's thesis;multitier architecture;secure transmission;sensor;visual intercept;wireless access point	Yansha Deng;Lifeng Wang;Maged Elkashlan;Arumugam Nallanathan;Ranjan K.

The hybrid spectrum access is responsible for throughput enhancement by escaping the waiting states whereas the spectrum prediction alleviates the sensing errors in the high-traffic communication environment. The closed-form expression for the throughput of cognitive user (CU) communication is derived and validated the proposed approach with the reported literature. Moreover, a new framework is proposed to conquer the sharing issues of conventional and proposed approaches. In addition to this, the performance metrics of proposed framework such as the data-loss, energy-loss of the CU and interference at the PU have been analyzed.	cognitive radio;profiling (computer programming)	Prabhat Thakur;Alok Kumar;Shweta Pandit;Ghanshyam Singh;S.

beff6be15adf1ee700ac2cf3d0a74fd686ac4a2e	alternating iterative secure structure between beamforming and power allocation for uav-aided directional modulation networks		Abstract In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, directional modulation (DM) is adopted to improve the secrecy rate (SR) performance. In this paper, an alternating iterative structure (AIS) between beamforming and power allocation (PA) is proposed to further improve the SR performance. Specifically Alice, a ground base station, behaves as a control center, and Bob is a UAV of flying along a linear flight trajectory who optimizes its SR performance by dynamically adjusting its beamforming vectors and PA strategy. Per fixed time interval during the Bob’s flight process, the transmit beamforming vectors for useful messages and artificial noise (AN) projection are given by the rule of maximizing signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (Max-SLNR) and maximizing AN-and-leakage-to-noise ratio (ANLNR), and the optimal PA strategy is based on maximizing SR (Max-SR). Simulation results show that the proposed AIS converges rapidly, and can achieve substantial SR gains over Max-SLNR plus Max-ANLNR with fixed PA such as PA factor β = 0 . 5 , and 0.9. In particular, in the case of small-scale antenna array, the SR performance gain achieved by the proposed AIS is more attractive. Additionally, as the number of antennas tends to be large-scale, the average SR performance of the proposed AIS approaches an SR ceil.	aerial photography;beamforming;converge;floor and ceiling functions;iterative method;mathematical optimization;modulation;optimization problem;pa-risc;ps (unix);simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle	Feng Shu;Zaoyu Lu;Jinyong Lin;Linlin Sun;Xiaobo Zhou;Tingting Liu;Shuo Zhang;Wenlong Cai;Jinhui Lu;Zhongjing Wang	2018	CoRR		flight (process);real-time computing;antenna array;trajectory;modulation;computer science;control theory;beamforming;artificial noise;base station	Robotics	38.90651811069645	86.99825772461327	181376

The CR system operates in a slotted mode, in which the SUs have no power supplies and harvest energy from ambient radio signal. Assuming SUs operate in a time switching fashion, the time slot is partitioned into three non-overlapping parts devoted for energy harvesting, spectrum sensing and data transmission. Then, the general problem of sum rate maximization is formulated as a mixed integer programming task. Since this problem is intractable, we propose a sub-channel allocation scheme based on a factor called Energy Figure of Merit to approximately satisfy SUs' rate requirements. Then, the integer constraints of the optimization problem are removed and the problem can be reduced to a convex optimization task. Considering the trade-off between fractions of the time slot, we focus on finding the optimal structures of SUs that maximize the total throughput while guaranteeing the rate requirements of both real-time (RT) and non-real-time (NRT) SUs. The numerical results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our sub-channel allocation method as well as performance gain of the optimal structure.	cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;ibm notes;integer programming;interference (communication);linear programming;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;optimization problem;power supply;radio wave;real-time clock;real-time computing;requirement;simulation;throughput;windows rt	Ali Shahini;Nirwan Ansari	2016	2016 IEEE 37th Sarnoff Symposium	10.1109/SARNOF.2016.7846741	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Embedded	32.986810282313726	88.2120803980281	181551

In particular, we investigate the robustness of the AF-CS scheme in the presence of a group of coordinated eavesdropping nodes under the assumption that they have corrupted channel state information. In order to fulfil this assumption, we propose a channel estimation technique based on pseudorandom pilots. This technique introduces extra uncertainty only in the channel estimation of the eavesdroppers. Our simulation results evaluate the physical-layer protection as a function of the total number of coordinated eavesdroppers and the level of channel estimation distortion of the eavesdroppers. We demonstrate that a small number of eavesdroppers (small being defined later on) has a zero probability of recovering the intended signal. We also show that a very large number of eavesdropping nodes are required to perfectly recover the signal in comparison with other distributed compressed sensing schemes in the literature.	anisotropic filtering;cs games;channel state information;compressed sensing;distortion;information-theoretic security;isometric projection;malware;pseudorandomness;relay;simulation;sparse matrix;with high probability	Joan Enric Barceló-Lladó;Antoni Morell;Gonzalo Seco-Granados	2012	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2014.2309855	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;compressed sensing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	35.381219969367756	83.55641486036703	182007
008d43378efe6be136e25732b0578ba468020942	detection of pilot contamination attack based on uncoordinated frequency shifts		Pilot contamination attack is an important activity of active eavesdropping conducted by a malicious user during channel training phase. This attack is potentially harmful to the physical layer security. In this paper, motivated by the fact that frequency asynchronism could introduce divergence of the transmitted pilot signals between intended user and attacker, we propose a new uncoordinated frequency shift (UFS) scheme for detecting pilot contamination attack in multiple antenna system. During the reverse training phase of the UFS scheme, the legitimate user Bob deliberately introduces multiple random frequency shifts in the publicly known pilot sequence. Since eavesdropper Eve has no knowledge of these random frequency shifts, it is almost impossible for her to pretend exactly like Bob. This provides the opportunity to detect the presence of Eve. An attack detection algorithm is then developed based on source enumeration method. Both the asymptotic performance analysis and numerical results are provided to verify the proposed detection scheme. The proposed scheme is also enhanced based on noise power estimation to cope with attacks from a multi-antenna Eve. Furthermore, the proposed UFS scheme is extended by introducing general parameterized phase shifts. It is demonstrated that the proposed UFS scheme can achieve comparable detection performance as the existing superimposed random sequence based scheme, without sacrifice of legitimate channel estimation performance.	algorithm;channel state information;eve;malware;man-in-the-middle attack;newton's method;noise power;numerical analysis;security hacker;sensor;universal flash storage	Weile Zhang;Hai Lin;Ruonan Zhang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2791535	electronic engineering;random sequence;parameterized complexity;noise power;physical layer;telecommunications link;computer science;algorithm;eavesdropping;communication channel	Security	35.92489864427018	83.35143755379507	182050
3507a5d63c040cadaafc13e12b849b1425a15c14	opportunistic early decoding for nb-iot devices using link abstraction based on rbir metric		Narrow Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is the specification defined by 3GPP for cellular IoT devices spanning a variety of IoT applications. Typical NB-IoT applications demand very long battery life. Improving battery life without impacting the application's communication needs is of great importance to extend the battery life in many applications. Coverage enhancement feature of NB-IoT requires eNB to choose a repetition from the finite set of values ranging from 1 to 2048. When the channel is favourable, user equipment (UE) may not need all the repetitions for decoding in downlink (DL). In this paper, we propose, an opportunistic early decode algorithm for downlink, using received bit information rate (RBIR) based link abstraction. This helps in reducing the total active time and hence the power consumption of device aiding the longer battery life.

Specifically, it is shown that the MSE duality holds for three levels of MSE which are sum-MSE (SMSE), per user MSE, and per stream MSE. For each case of duality level, we consider both total power constraint and separate power constraint. We also provide a conversion method which transforms a given transceiver and scale factor in DL to equivalent ones in UL for each case of duality level and each case of power constraint.	algorithm;constraint logic programming;direct manipulation interface;fenchel's duality theorem;fixed point (mathematics);lambda calculus;linear function;mean squared error;multi-user mimo;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;relay;social inequality;telecommunications link;transceiver	Seung-Hun Jang;Young-Min Cho;Janghoon Yang;Dong Ku Kim	2012	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2012.091712.121143	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;statistics;transceiver	Vision	37.961171840141844	88.14086724090446	183795

In this pape r, w consider the cognitive access of primary channels by a secondary user (SU). We evaluate the average de tection time and the maximum achievable average throughput of the SU when the sequential method for h and-over (SMHO) is used. We assume that a prior knowledge of the primary users’ presence and abs ence probabilities are available. In order to investigate the maximum achievable throughput of the SU, we end into an optimization problem, in which the optimum value of sensing time must be selected. I n our optimization problem, we take into account the spectrum hand over due to false detection of the primary user. We also propose a weighted based hand-over (WBHO) scheme in which the impacts of channels conditions and primary users’ presence probability are considered. This spectrum handover scheme provides higher average throughput for the SU compared to the SMHO method. The tradeo ff b tween the maximum achievable throughput and consumed energy is discussed, and finally an e nergy efficient optimization formulation for finding a proper sensing time is provided.	astrophysics data system;cognitive radio;mathematical optimization;norm (social);optimization problem;profiling (computer programming);superuser;throughput;wilhelm pape	Hossein Shokri Ghadikolaei;Mohammad Mahdi Mozaffari;Masoumeh Nasiri-Kenari	2011	CoRR		cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	33.512720826651666	86.92170745294635	185861
6b9485117b19ffcee9a59b52820d65a1698e75e1	asymptotic performance analysis of gsvd-noma systems with a large-scale antenna array		This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink communication scenario with one base station and two users, where each user is equipped with  $m$  antennas and the base station is equipped with  $n$  antennas. To efficiently exploit the spectrum resources, we propose a transmission protocol which combines generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The expected data rates achieved by the two users are adopted as performance metrics for the evaluation of the proposed GSVD-NOMA scheme. In particular, we first characterize the limiting distribution of the squared generalized singular values of the two users’ channel matrices for the asymptotic case, where the numbers of transmit and receive antennas approach infinity. Then, we calculate the expected normalized individual rates of the users in the considered asymptotic regime. Furthermore, we extend the proposed GSVD-NOMA scheme to the general MIMO downlink communication scenario with more than two users. To this end, we propose a hybrid multiple access approach, where the base station divides the users into different groups, the proposed GSVD-NOMA scheme is implemented within each group, and different groups are allocated orthogonal bandwidth resources. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed GSVD-NOMA protocol and the accuracy of the developed analytical results.

A non-cooperative game is proposed in which each user seeks to choose its transmit power (and possibly transmit symbol rate) as well as the constellation size in order to maximize its own utility while satisfying its delay quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. The utility function used here measures the number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed, and is particularly suitable for energy-constrained networks. The best-response strategies and Nash equilibrium solution for the proposed game are derived. It is shown that in order to maximize its utility (in bits per joule), a user must choose the lowest constellation size that can accommodate the user's delay constraint. Using this framework, the tradeoffs among energy efficiency, delay, throughput and constellation size are also studied and quantified.

In the case of a single target legitimate signal, we sh ow t at the existing result based on the simplification of the system model by neglecting the jamming channel leads t o losing important insights regarding the effect of jamming power and jamming channel on the jamming strategy. W e find a closed-form optimal solution for the problem under a positive semi-definite (PSD) condition without cons idering simplifications in the model. If the condition is not satisfied and the optimal solution may not exist in closed -form, we find the optimal solution using a numerical method and also propose a suboptimal solution in closed-for m as a close approximation of the optimal solution. Then, the possibility of extending the results to solve the p roblem of multi-target jamming is investigated for four scenarios, i.e., multiple access channel, broadcasting ch annel, multiple transceiver pairs with orthogonal transmi ssions, and multiple transceiver pairs with interference, respect iv ly. It is shown that the proposed numerical method can be extended to all scenarios while the proposed closed-form so lutions for jamming may be applied in the scenarios of the multiple access channel and multiple transceiver pairs with orthogonal transmissions. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. Index Terms jamming MIMO channels, closed-form solution, suboptimal s olution, multi-target jamming. I. I NTRODUCTION Security is a major concern in wireless communications [1]4 . Due to the rapid development of wireless communications, the security issue rises while wireless co mmunication networks of different scales containing devices for different purposes become more common and popul ar. Major threats to wireless communications include passive wiretapping and active jamming [5]. While the passi ve threat can be addressed by using well-designed security architectures, wireless communications are vuln erable to the active jamming attack [6]. Jamming aims at degrading the quality of communication or disrupting the in formation transmission in a communication system by directing energy toward the target receiver in a destructiv e manner [7]. A jamming attack is particularly effective because it is easy to launch using low-cost and small-sized d evices while causing very significant security threat [8]. The threat of jamming has been studied in many research works [9]–[11], and one of the relevant research interests is to investigate the optimal jamming strategy from the pers ctive of a jammer [8], [12], [13]. Such perspective helps to reveal the effect of jamming on legitimate communic ations in the worst case. January 16, 2014 DRAFT 2 When a jammer has multiple antennas, it can maximize the effe ctiveness of jamming by optimizing its jamming signal. The optimal jamming on multiple-input multiple-ou tp t (MIMO) channels is investigated in [14][17]. It is shown in [14] that without knowledge of the target signal or i ts covariance, the jammer can only use basic strategies of allocating power uniformly or maximizing the total power of the interference at the target receiver. In [15], the transmit strategies of a legitimate transmitter and a jamme r on a Gaussian MIMO channel are investigated under a game-theoretic modeling with a general utility function. I t is assumed that the jammer and the legitimate transmitter have the same level of channel state information (CSI), i.e. , both uninformed, both with statistical CSI, or both with exact CSI. The optimal transmitted strategies of the legiti ma e transmitter and the jammer are represented as solution s to different optimization problems versus different types of CSI. The worst-case jamming on MIMO multiple access and broadcast channels with the covariance of the target sig nal and all channel information available at the jammer is studied in [16] based on game theory. Some properties of th e optimal jamming strategies are characterized through the analysis of the Nash equilibrium of the game. The necessary condition for optimal jamming on MIMO channels with arbitrary inputs when the covariance of the ta rget signal and all channel information are available at the jammer is derived in [17]. For the case of Gaussian targ e si nal, the solution of optimal jamming is given in closed-form. However, it is derived without considering the jamming channel. As a result, the system model is oversimplified by implicitly assuming that the received jam ming signal at the target receiver is exactly the same as the transmitted jamming signal at the jammer. With the objective of providing a general solution without o versimplifications of the system model, this work addresses the problem of optimal jamming on MIMO Gaussian ch annels. First, the problem of jamming a single target communication between a legitimate transceiver pai r will be investigated. Then, we show that the methods used for obtaining the solution of the single-target jammin g problem can be extended to solve multi-target jamming problem. The main contributions of this work are as follows. First, for the general case of jamming a target communicatio n on a MIMO Gaussian channel, we show that the optimal solution may or may not exist in closed-form. It is sh own that the existence of the optimal solution in closed-form, given the target signal and the legitimate com munication channel, depends on the jammer’s power limit and the jamming channel. The optimal solution in close d-form is given under a positive semi-definite (PSD) condition and the solution in [17] is shown to be a special cas e of our general solution. Second, we propose a suboptimal solution in closed-form as a n alternative strategy for the jammer so that the complexity of finding the solution remains low when there is n o closed-form expression for the optimal solution. For finding the optimal solution in this case, a numeric metho d which is proved to converge to optimality is used. The two alternative solutions provide a choice between low c mplexity and high accuracy. Simulation demonstrates that the proposed suboptimal solution is in fact very close t o the optimal one, and thereby qualifies as a very good approximation of the optimal solution. Third, we extend the above results by considering multi-tar get jamming. Four scenarios of multi-target jamming are considered, i.e., jamming a multiple access channel, ja mming a broadcast channel, jamming multiple transceiver pairs with orthogonal transmissions, and jamming multiple transceiver pairs with interference. It is shown that while January 16, 2014 DRAFT 3 the numeric method for finding the optimal solution to the pro blem of single target jamming can be extended, after proper modifications, to all four scenarios, the metho dol gy in obtaining the closed-form expressions of the optimal/suboptimal solution can be adopted for the scenari o of jamming a multiple access channel and possibly the scenario of jamming multiple transceiver pairs with orthog onal transmissions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II give s the system model of this work. The closedform solution to the problem of jamming a single legitimate c ommunication and the condition for it to exist are investigated in Section III. When this condition is not met, the optimal numerical solution and a suboptimal solution in closed-form are found in Sections IV and V, respectively. The possibility of extending the results to multi-target jamming and the corresponding modifications required are de monstrated in Section VI. Section VII shows the simulation results which verify the effectiveness of the so luti ns obtained in previous sections and Section VIII concludes the paper. Section IX “Appendix” provides proofs f r the lemmas and theorems. II. SYSTEM MODEL A legitimate transmitter withnt antennas sends a signal s to a receiver withnr antennas. The elements of s are independent and identically distributed Gaussian with zer o mean and covariance Qs. A jammer withnz antennas attempts to jam the legitimate communication by transmitti ng a jamming signalz to the receiver. Denote the legitimate channel from the legitimate transmitter to the r eceiver asHr (of sizenr × nt) and the jamming channel from the jammer to the receiver as Hz (of sizenr×nz). In the presence of the jamming signal, the received signal at the legitimate receiver is expressed as y = Hrs+Hzz+ n (1) wheren is the noise at the legitimate receiver with zero mean and cov arianceσI. Here I denotes the identity matrix of an appropriate size. Note that given the Gaussian c hannel and Gaussian target signal, the worst-case form of jamming signal is also Gaussian [18]. Denote the cova riance ofz asQz. Then the information rate of the legitimate communication in the presence of the jamming is e xpr ssed at R = log |I+HrQsH H r (HzQzH H z + σ I)| (2) where| · | and(·) denote the determinant and the Hermitian transpose, respec tively. The jammer aims at decreasing the above rate as much as possible given its power limit Pz. The jammer is assumed to have the knowledge of Hr, Hz, andQs but not the exact s. As a result, it is not able to perform correlated jamming [19 ]. However, the jammer can use the available knowledge to find the optimal Qz such that the rate (2) is minimized. This problem is studied in details in the following section. January 16, 2014 DRAFT 4 III. O PTIMAL JAMMING IN CLOSED-FORM UNDERPSDCONDITION Given the system model, the optimal jamming strategy can be f ound by solving the following problem 1 min Qz R (3a) s.t. Tr{Qz} ≤ Pz (3b) where Tr{·} denotes the trace. With only one pair of transceiver, the abo ve problem is a basic jamming problem on a MIMO channel. Denote the singular value decomposition (SVD) of Hz asHz = UzΩzV z . The matricesUz, Ωz, andVz are of sizesnr × nr, nr × nz, andnz × nz, respectively.

The optimal transmit power adaptation policy with average transmit power constraint is found to be “water-pouring” in the frequency-time domain. We also show that the channel capacity with the frequency-time domain transmit power adaptation is greater than that with only the frequency domain transmit power adaptation.

Limited by the rank and power constraints, the precoding matrices are designed under two interesting scenarios. The first scenario assumes the availability of pilots that can be precoded, using which the transmitter can convey any choice of transmit precoders to the users. Consequently, the sought transmit precoders can be any complex-valued matrices subject to given rank (dimensionality) and power (norm) constraints. A provably convergent cyclic alternating ascent based algorithm is proposed for a relaxed version of the problem, and is shown to attain at least a stationary point. Assuming that no such pilots are available, the second scenario constrains the transmit precoders to lie in a finite codebook. A concatenation based approach is adopted for constructing higher rank precoding matrices, which can facilitate the precoder search and allow for efficient signaling. A simple deterministic algorithm is proposed which involves maximizing a submodular rate function per step, and yields a worst-case performance guarantee.	alternating turing machine;best, worst and average case;codebook;concatenation;deterministic algorithm;mimo;multicast;stationary process;submodular set function;times ascent;transmitter;weight function	Hao Zhu;Narayan Prasad;Sampath Rangarajan	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503455	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics	Vision	36.520794936702934	88.16098397019996	187066

The feedback channel (the corresponding uplink) is modeled as a MIMO multiple access channel. Under the assumption that data transmission, downlink training, and feedback are performed within the same channel coherence interval of length T symbols, the optimization of a lower bound on the achievable ergodic rate sum yields a non-trivial resource allocation tradeoff.We solve this tradeoff and provide the optimal training and feedback resource allocation for the case of zero-forcing beamforming. When the same power level is used during all stages, it is found that the optimal length of the training + feedback phases increases as O(radicT) for large T. On the other hand, when different power levels can be used for different stages, for sufficiently large T it is optimal to use the minimum number of symbols for training + feedback but to use power of order O(radicT).	beamforming;channel state information;ergodicity;feedback;mimo;mathematical optimization;systems design;telecommunications link;transmitter	Mari Kobayashi;Giuseppe Caire;Nihar Jindal	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595475	zero forcing equalizer;coherence;telecommunications link;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;base station;control theory;feedback;mathematics;channel state information;upper and lower bounds;signal-to-noise ratio;precoding;statistics;data transmission;mimo	Mobile	38.75921745399673	84.27376936416437	187103

We consider a multi-user environment, where users transmit to a common destination, without engaging the idle users into cooperation. Two nodes constituting a pair periodically swap the roles of source and relay to mutually achieve spatial diversity. As such, conditioned on the successful detection of the source's packet, a network coded packet is formed at the relay by a linear combination of its own packet and the source's packet. A single transmission of this network coded packet therefore helps both nodes to achieve diversity gain. We address the problem of finding the optimal user pairing which maximizes the network capacity. Using this optimal capacity pairing, we subsequently solve a constrained optimization problem to minimize the transmission power, such that the network performance constraint in terms of the maximum average outage probability per user is met.	constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);downtime;linear network coding;mathematical optimization;multi-user;network packet;network performance;optimization problem;paging;power optimization (eda);relay;sun outage;throughput;user interface	Talha Rasheed;Mohamed Hossam Ahmed;Octavia A.

Recently, energy harvesting cognitive radio networks have been proposed to attempt to solve both the issues simultaneously. In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio network in which a primary transmitter mainly occupies the channel, and a secondary transmitter equipped with an energy harvesting device is allowed to opportunistically access the primary channel at any time if it is detected to be idle. Here, we assume that energy arrival process and primary channel state are random process and two-state time-homogenous discrete Markov process, respectively. Instead of the expected number of successful spectrum access attempts per time slot as a design criterion in current literature, we use the average channel capacity as the achievable throughput to jointly optimize energy harvesting and spectrum sensing subject to the constraints on the energy causality, collision, and temporal correlation of probability of sensing the idle/occupied channel, thus achieving or almost achieving both the energy efficiency and the spectrum efficiency in certain conditions. In addition, the corresponding optimum detection threshold and the maximum achievable throughput are obtained, which are substantiated by our comprehensive computer simulations.	causality;channel capacity;cognitive radio;computer simulation;primary channel;spectral efficiency;stochastic process;telecommunications network;throughput;transmitter	Gangtao Han;Jian-Kang Zhang;Xiaomin Mu	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2616353	throughput;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;electrical engineering;efficient energy use;energy harvesting;computer network	Mobile	32.535157422070526	85.95613884373	188718

However, its implementation in a wireless network involves the fundamental challenge of ensuring phase coherence of the radio frequency signals from the different transmitters in the presence of unknown phase offsets between the transmitters and unknown channel gains from the transmitters to the receiver. In this paper, it is shown that such phase alignment can be achieved using distributed adaptation by the transmitters with minimal feedback from the receiver. Specifically, each transmitter independently makes a small random adjustment to its phase at each iteration, while the receiver broadcasts a single bit of feedback, indicating whether the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improved or worsened after the current iteration. The transmitters keep the ¿good¿ phase adjustments and discard the ¿bad¿ ones, thus implementing a distributed ascent algorithm. It is shown that, for a broad class of distributions for the random phase adjustments, this procedure leads to asymptotic phase coherence with probability one. A simple analytical model, borrowing ideas from statistical mechanics, is used to characterize the progress of the algorithm, and to provide guidance on parameter choices. This analytical model is based on a conjecture on the distribution of the received phases when the number of transmitters becomes large. Finally, the proposed system is shown to be scalable: the random phase perturbations can be chosen such that the convergence time is linear in the number of collaborating nodes.	algorithm;beamforming;feedback;information theory;iteration;radio frequency;scalability;signal-to-noise ratio;times ascent;transmitter	Raghuraman Mudumbai;João Pedro Hespanha;Upamanyu Madhow;Gwen Barriac	2010	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2009.2034786	distributed algorithm;transmitter;telecommunications;information theory;statistical mechanics;computer science	Mobile	38.67081727235357	81.90442277981761	188924

In the considered system, the power beacon can provide wireless energy for the source and relays which deploy time-switching-based radio frequency energy harvesting technique. Two relay selection schemes, namely partial relay selection and optimal relay selection, are proposed in order to enhance the system performance. In the former, the source only has the channel state information of the first hop, while in the latter it has the full knowledge of the channel state information. The eavesdropper is able to wiretap to the signal transmitted from the source and the relays. The exact closed-form expressions of secrecy outage probability are derived. The results show that optimal relay selection performs better than partial relay selection. With increasing number of relays, the considered system shows better performance. In addition, the energy harvesting duration has a significant effect on the secrecy outage probability.

Most existing works mainly investigate the system performance given the attacking patterns. In this paper, we investigate how the attacker should design its DoS attacking policy so that the system performance can be deteriorated as much as possible. Specifically, we consider the scenario where a sensor sends its data to a remote estimator through a wireless channel for state estimation, while an attacker decides whether to jam the channel at each sampling time. For two typical system performance indexes, i.e., the expected average estimation error and the expected terminal estimation error, we construct optimal attack scheduling schemes, respectively. We also propose the optimal attack schedules to avoid the given intruder detection mechanism. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our results.	cyber-physical system;dos;denial-of-service attack;experiment;feedback;intruder detection;jam;like button;mean squared error;sampling (signal processing);schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);social inequality	Heng Zhang;Peng Cheng;Ling Shi;Jiming Chen	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760746	telecommunications;computer science;engineering;scheduling;computer security;computer network	EDA	33.545374939832364	83.22123896219212	189681

This paper considers energy-efficient relaying schemes through selection of mobile relays in cooperative cellular systems with asymmetric traffic. The total energy consumption per information bit of the battery-powered terminals, i.e., the mobile station (MS) and the relay, is derived in theory. In the Joint Uplink and Downlink Relay Selection (JUDRS) scheme we proposed, the relay which minimizes the total energy consumption is selected. Additionally, the energy-efficient cooperation regions are investigated, and the optimal relay location is found for cooperative cellular systems with asymmetric traffic. The results reveal that the MS-relay and the relay-base station (BS) channels have different influence over relay selection decisions for optimal energy-efficiency. Information theoretic analysis of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) demonstrates that the proposed scheme achieves full spatial diversity in the quantity of cooperating terminals in this network. Finally, numerical results further confirm a significant energy efficiency gain of the proposed algorithm comparing to the previous best worse channel selection and best harmonic mean selection algorithms.	algorithm;anisotropic filtering;architecture tradeoff analysis method;digital monetary trust;multiplexing;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);relay;telecommunications link;theory	Wei Yang;Lihua Li;Wanlu Sun	2010	CoRR	10.1016/S1005-8885(09)60529-X	cellular network;antenna diversity;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;base station;efficient energy use;mobile station;relay channel;harmonic mean;statistics;computer network	Mobile	32.250463087312994	84.64650294628586	190167

However, this is not true when deploying FD-communication in a large-scale setup due to the induced mutual interference. Therefore, a large-scale study is necessary to draw legitimate conclusions about gains associated with FD-communication. This paper studies the FD operation for underlay device-to-device (D2D) communication sharing the uplink resources in cellular networks. We propose a disjoint fine-tuned selection criterion for the D2D and FD modes of operation. Then, we develop a tractable analytical paradigm, based on stochastic geometry, to calculate the outage probability and rate for cellular and D2D users. The results reveal that even in the case of perfect SIC, due to the increased interference injected to the network by FD-D2D communication, having all proximity UEs transmit in FD-D2D is not beneficial for the network. However, if the system parameters are carefully tuned, non-trivial network spectral-efficiency gains (64% shown) can be harvested. We also investigate the effects of imperfect SIC and D2D-link distance distribution on the harvested FD gains.	block cipher mode of operation;cobham's thesis;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);link distance;programming paradigm;simplified instructional computer;spectral efficiency;sun outage;telecommunications link	Konpal Shaukat Ali;Hesham Elsawy;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2016	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2601912	stochastic process;electronic engineering;telecommunications link;telecommunications;power control;theoretical computer science;mathematics;interference	Mobile	36.94633140562402	82.14230595126963	190665
ef69d23eadd7efbd74572c1458bdf8b5810ac757	joint optimization of cognitive rf energy harvesting and channel access using markovian multi-armed bandit problem		With the growing number of connected devices (e.g. smartphones, sensors, actuators and cameras) in 5G, the massive Internet of Thing (IoT) is expected to address a wide range of characteristics and demands, with more radio-frequency (RF) bands to support multiple frequency transmission by 2020. Separate antennas and RF chips may be required for widely separated frequency bands. The development of cognitive radio systems focused on channel access and spectrum sensing, which can be programmed and configured dynamically, is therefore fundamental for the successful deployment of such systems. This paper introduces an innovative system for spectrum sensing, channel access and power for energy constrained wireless sensor networks. A commercially available evaluation board is used to detect and convert RF signals to a DC voltage for powering a sensor board that communicates over other channels to an access point. Our spectrum sensing conceptualizes the Markovian formulation of the exploration/exploitation balancing technique of available frequency bands, also known as the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem. To optimize RF energy harvesting and data transmission in channels modeled by a Rayleigh distribution, we formulate and solve a joint reward equation for the MAB Gittins indices, then compare with another MAB algorithm. The simulation results show the optimality of the Gittins index allocation strategy in terms of channel selection percentage and minimization of the regret.	cognitive radio;exploit (computer security);frequency band;greedy algorithm;mathematical optimization;miwi;microcontroller;microprocessor development board;multi-armed bandit;multiplexer;radio frequency;rayleigh–ritz method;regret (decision theory);sensor;simulation;smartphone;software deployment;wireless access point	Fahira Sangare;Zhu Han	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)	10.1109/ICCW.2017.7962705	gittins index;cognitive radio;computer network;wireless sensor network;real-time computing;radio frequency;data transmission;multi-armed bandit;radio spectrum;computer science;communication channel	Mobile	32.66339990668071	86.80271641059372	191946

One challenging task in the MIMO system design is to accommodate the multiple antennas in the mobile device without compromising the system capacity, due to spatial and electrical constraints. Based on an interface between the antenna model and the propagation channel model, the ergodic capacity is considered as the objective function of the MIMO array optimization. Simulation results corroborate the importance of polarization and antenna pattern diversities for MIMO in small terminals. Our results also show that the electromagnetic coupling effect can be exploited by the optimizer to decrease signal correlation and increase MIMO capacity. A comparison among a uniform linear array (ULA), a uniform circular array (UCA), and a genetic algorithm (GA)-optimized array is also carried out, showing that the topology given by the optimizer is superior to that of the standard ULA and UCA for the considered propagation channel.

0c63be817a696a1ca5f1a870e616a82841822103	optimal jamming attack strategy against wireless state estimation: a game theoretic approach		The performance of wireless remote state estimation depends on the wireless channel quality, and hence is vulnerable to wireless channel jamming attack. In this paper, we investigate the problem of optimal jamming attack schedule that causes the largest performance degradation to the remote state estimation system. Unlike many previous studies, we consider that the sensor transmit data to the remote estimator through one of multiple independent wireless channels. Due to radio constraint of the attacker, we assume that it can only launch jamming attack on one of the channels at each step. We propose a matrix game approach to model the interactions between the attacker and the sensor and theoretically prove the existence of an optimal attack strategy. We further design an online algorithm based on temporal-difference learning for the attacker to make attack decisions. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the game theoretical method.

We construct groups within the MCN, where each group comprises of a source node, a destination node, their intermediate relay nodes and assign a correlated PN sequence to each such group. Within a particular group, a single carrier is assigned to each intermediate hop. The sub carriers assigned to the intermediate hops in a given group are mutually orthogonal. Hence the proposed OFDM is FDMA in nature. The sub carriers and transmit power levels to the relay nodes are assigned in such a way as to maximize the end-to-end throughput. The end-to-end throughput is formulated by assuming a Rayleigh flat fading channel between nodes. We present a method to reuse the PN codes assigned to the groups in a particular cell. We also introduce a novel architecture for MCN. Simulation results show that the proposed access mechanism achieves better end-to-end throughput and bit error rate (BER) performance as compared to standard access mechanisms like CDMA and OFDM-FDMA. Furthermore the proposed access mechanism has considerably higher BER performance in the presence of multiple transmit sources.	bit error rate;code;constrained optimization;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;genetic algorithm;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;pseudorandom number generator;rayleigh–ritz method;relay;simulation;throughput;x.690	Kannan Govindan;S.

The proposed scheme uses a maximum-ratio combining (MRC) detector in the uplink together with a maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) precoder in the downlink. By using minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation, the total uplink and downlink transmit power is minimized under per-user signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement and per-user power consumption constraints. Lower bounds of the average SINR are derived and used in the power allocation algorithm in order to simplify the optimization problem. The tightness of the derived SINR lower bounds and the advantage of the proposed power saving scheme as compared to equal power allocation among all users are validated by computer simulation.	algorithm;channel state information;computer simulation;convex optimization;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multi-user mimo;optimization problem;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;test-driven development	Yingjie Zhang;Jun Yan;Jian Ouyang	2016	2016 IEEE 84th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7880987	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;resource management	EDA	37.9242776737766	86.86948426769096	193948

We propose a method to obtain everlasting secrecy by exploiting inter-symbol interference (ISI) in eavesdropper. In the proposed method, the pulse shaping filter in the transmitter changes with time in the faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling structure. The filter hopping pattern is pre-shared between the transmitter and the legitimate receiver. Knowing the hopping pattern, the legitimate receiver can mitigate the ISI as that in FTN. Otherwise, the eavesdropper will experience severe interference. The results show that even the eavesdropping link is much better than the legitimate link, a positive secrecy rate is also obtained. The secrecy rates for various examples of the proposed method are evaluated and the comparisons with other information-theoretic security schemes are also shown.

The results show that the outage performance of secondary system improves with the increase of maximum tolerated interference power before a specific threshold, but it keeps unchanged after the threshold. The results also show that more relays can provide higher diversity gain to get better outage performance in this kind of cognitive radio system. It is also indicated that the outage performance of secondary system is affected by the activity behavior of primary network, and relay cooperation can decrease this kind of affection.	cognitive radio;downtime;interference (communication);relay;sun outage	Zhi Yan;Xing Zhang;Wenbo Wang	2011	2011 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2011.5779452	transmitter;cognitive radio;index term;telecommunications;computer science;interference;upper and lower bounds;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Mobile	35.55457880021233	85.3727964046739	196126

This scheduler collects channel state information (CSI) from all users and allocates the resources to the user(s) experiencing favorable channel conditions. However, for a frequency-division-duplex system with a large number of users, how to efficiently collect the required CSI will be a challenging task, especially when the feedback links are of limited capacity. In this paper, we propose a scheduling algorithm to exploit multiuser diversity with possibly imperfect one-bit channel state feedback. The basic idea is to define a threshold lambda and let each user report one-bit information to the scheduler about the comparison between its measured channel fading level and lambda. Correspondingly, the scheduler uses these feedback bits to classify all users into two sets and assigns the channel to one user belonging to the set experiencing favorable channel conditions. Several implementation schemes are developed by attacking the optimization of lambda under different system configurations, covering both the case when the one-bit feedback is perfect and those when the one-bit feedback is imperfect. Computer simulations show that when the user number is large, say, more than ten users, the proposed scheduling supports significantly larger data rate over the round-robin scheduling, while in comparison with the optimum scheduling with complete CSI, the performance loss is limited if the one-bit feedback is of high reliability. In addition, our studies show that we can effectively enhance the robustness against feedback imperfectness by incorporating the feedback reliability into optimization of lambda	algorithm;channel state information;data rate units;duplex (telecommunications);feedback;mathematical optimization;multi-user;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Yisheng Xue;Thomas Kaiser	2007	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2006.883784	computer simulation;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;operating system;scheduling;statistics;computer network	Mobile	38.275016811839755	82.11795979538213	196328

05e4b3b8e8af21e82304b73074c2f847811a9b7d	a new energy-efficient relay selection technique for large-scale randomly distributed wireless networks		Correspondence Ibrahim Aydin, Istanbul Technical University, Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, 34469, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey. Email: iaydin@itu.edu.tr Abstract The key question need to be answered about relay selection in a large-scale randomly distributed wireless network is that how to select a relay energy efficiently under a throughput (i.e., effective data rate) constraint with a reasonable complexity. It is not practical to collect instantaneous channel state information of all relays for relay selection because of excessive control packet transmission and useless energy consumption because to hold a relay in active mode to participate relay selection process needs significantly more power consumption than to hold in sleep mode. In this paper we propose a new energy-efficient relay selection technique for large-scale randomly distributed wireless networks for which an active relay region is introduced where only the relays in the region are taken into consideration for relay selection. Then, we propose a simple relay selection technique, which is only based on the channel state information of source-relay channels of the relay subset to reduce the complexity and signaling overhead. The proposed relay selection technique increases energy efficiency at an acceptable complexity level without jeopardizing the effective data rate. We investigate the optimum size of the active relay region for energy efficient in which relays perform decode-and-forward technique. A detailed and realistic power consumption model is studied by taking all possible sources of power consumption into consideration, i.e., data transmission, signaling packets transmission, and circuit power consumption during all phases of the communication. We show that the proposed technique is more energy efficient and provides better effective data rate in comparison to the reference techniques.		Ibrahim Aydin;Ümit Aygölü	2017	Trans.

In our proposal, zero-forcing DPC is employed to cancel the interference not only from the primary user but also from other cognitive users. The transmit power constraint is satisfied by the application of the multiuser trellis shaping. The optimal values of the power allocation parameter and the scaling factor are derived. The performance of this scheme is compared using simulations with that employing conventional trellis shaping.	coexist (image);cognition;cognitive radio;deferred procedure call;image scaling;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;noise shaping;shaping codes;simulation;transmitter;trellis quantization;x.690;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Yuting Sun;Wenbo Xu;Jiaru Lin	2014	2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136455	3g mimo;cognitive radio;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;encoding;statistics;mimo	Mobile	38.452513351880846	85.55858193259108	196670

We derive the closed-form expression of coverage probability for two NOMA users as a function of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To fully take into account the effect of ICI, we adopt more practical parameters to evaluate the optimal power splitting coefficient regarding energy harvesting system performance analysis. Furthermore, to consider a more practical scenario, based on the fact that the number of ICI sources can affect wireless powered relays, we investigate the average outage probability by considering impacts of the reasonable number of participating ICI.

The new combining scheme, compared to conventional Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC), not only combats multi-path fading, but also mitigates interference by further scaling the finger output inversely proportional to its total average interference power. This interference power is found to be mutually uncorrelated among fingers and its average power is proportional to its instantaneous channel gain. The reason being that the interference power varies at the chip rate (MHz) while channel gain varies at the fading rate (Hundreds of Hz). It is also found that the interference caused by non-orthogonality due to multi-path delays is same for all the fingers. This makes the optimum weights depend only on the channel impulse response and renders an easy way to obtain the optimum weights without actually measuring or estimating the interference power. In this paper, we show how the proportional scaling of finger outputs can be performed based on a finger’s own instantaneous channel gain. Therefore the new combining Rake receiver is simply an MRC Rake receiver with each finger’s weight further scaled proportionally to the instantaneous channel gain. Compared with other optimum combining schemes, such as DMI or LMS, the new scheme has much lower cost, does not have sample support problems and converges to MRC when there is no interference or the multi-paths have equal average power. Simulation results show that the proposed optimum combining Rake receiver has a 0.3dB to 2.5dB gain over the MRC Rake receiver.	direct media interface;image scaling;interference (communication);maximal set;rake;rendering (computer graphics);simulation;telecommunications link	Ning Kong;Ian Riphagen;Michiel P.

50a346530a619bc858e80e498d3ddf3eca3f34eb	spectrum sensing and power classification in spatially correlated noise scenarios		"""In this paper, we propose a spectrum sensing and power classification scheme in hybrid interweave- underlay cognitive radio networks, considering that the primary system is with multiple transmission powers and the noise at the secondary user (SU) is spatially correlated. The primary target is to detect the presence of the primary user (PU), while the secondary target is to classify the transmission power of the PU, such that the SU can switch to underlay model with a flexible transmission power for fully exploring the spectrum access opportunities. The proposed scheme is a non-coherent detection scheme, where the weighted energy of the received signals serves as the decision metric. We derive the optimal sensing threshold for detecting the ``on/off"""" state of the PU as well as closed-form decision thresholds for classifying the PU's transmission power. The proposed scheme can efficiently identify the PU's transmission power by leveraging the correlation information of the noise observations.

The secondary user assigned to one of the primary frequency bands is aided by a set of nearby secondary users, which we refer to as secondary relays. We assume that each secondary relay participates in relaying the secondary packets with certain probability. In a given time slot, each secondary relay indicates its ability of decoding the secondary packet and being a relay for the secondary transmission. Our proposed protocol exploits the sparsity of the participating relays set and is efficient as it allows dynamic relay assignment. When the primary user is inactive, the relays send their states to the secondary source which, in turn, transmits its own packet if the received number of decoding relays satisfies a predefined threshold. When the primary user is active, the relays perform cooperative beamforming to achieve a cooperative diversity gain for the secondary source while completely eliminating the interference to the primary destination. We study the performance of the system from a cross-layer point of view.	beamforming;chi;cognitive radio;compressed sensing;downtime;emoticon;frequency band;interference (communication);network packet;point of view (computer hardware company);rayleigh–ritz method;relay;secondary source;sparse matrix;throughput	Ahmed El Shafie;Naofal Al-Dhahir;Ridha Hamila	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2015.7127632	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;compressed sensing;beamforming;queue;computer network	Mobile	34.85224789132987	84.2721270451733	196892
0a8b59d0249a2ae35cf06b392ab705a98ca954b1	multiple amplify-and-forward full-duplex relays for legitimate eavesdropping		In this paper, we consider a legitimate proactive eavesdropping scenario where a central monitor tries to intercept the information exchanged between a pair of suspicious entities through amplify-and-forward full- duplex relays and a cooperative jammer. Specifically, the eavesdropping relays simultaneously listen to the suspicious transmitter and forward the eavesdropped information to the central monitor. At the same time, the jammer broadcasts the jamming signal to maintain the suspicious data rate below the channel capacity of the central monitor so that the eavesdropped information can be successfully decoded by the central monitor. In this system, we jointly design the relay precoders at the eavesdropping relays and the transmit covariance matrix at the jammer to maximize the eavesdropping rate by a two-layer semi-definite relaxation approach.

The association (or the integration) of base station assignment with power control allows a given network to have better achievable performance. I n this paper, we investigate the association of base station assignment and power control in order to study the best achievable signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) behaviour. The existence of a feasible solution to the quality constraints problem, along with the choice of the base station assignment in order to have the minimal sum of transmitted powers, are discussed. This is done for a unique SIR target and for multi-target environment. We also address two problems: the base station assignment as a function of network quality targets and best achievable perjormance which is represented by the highest achievable SIR for every possible BS assignment vector. This last value is computed with less computations than when it is directly calculated. Simulations show that appropriate base station assignment may give interesting capacity gains, especially for non-uniform distributions.	computation;computer simulation;interference (communication);rain fade;regular expression;telecommunications link	Loutfi Nuaymi;Philippe Godlewski	2000		10.1109/ISCC.2000.860723	telecommunications;computer science;base station;base station identity code;computer network	Arch	32.96031671787012	88.39439362450145	199633

The optimal policies result in a coding scheme that is simpler than the one for a general multiple access channel with generalized feedback. This simpler coding scheme also leads to the possibility of formulating an otherwise non-concave optimization problem as a concave one. Using the perfect channel state information available at the transmitters to adapt the powers, we demonstrate gains over the achievable rates for existing cooperative systems.	channel state information;code;concave function;consensus dynamics;convex optimization;convex set;entropy maximization;markov chain;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation;transmitter;universal quantification	Onur Kaya;Sennur Ulukus	2007	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2007.05858	transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	35.74770707619319	87.91993553526221	199902
