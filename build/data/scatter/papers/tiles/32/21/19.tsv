68b3fd39e60b62dda9de9cf280b44da984cc9a92	appendix: on set coverings in cartesian product spaces	cartesian product;number of cliques;stable set;set cover	Consider (X, E), where X is a finite set and E is a system of subsets whose union equals X. For every natural number n ∈ N define the cartesian products Xn = ∏n 1 X and En = ∏n 1 E . The following problem is investigated: how many sets of En are needed to cover Xn? Let this number be denoted by c(n). It is proved that for all n ∈ N exp{C · n} ≤ c(n) ≤ exp{Cn + log n + log log |X|} + 1. A formula for C is given. The result generalizes to the case where X and E are not necessarily finite and also to the case of non–identical factors in the product. As applications one obtains estimates on the minimal size of an externally stable set in cartesian product graphs and also estimates on the minimal number of cliques needed to cover such graphs. 1 A Covering Theorem Let X be a non–empty set with finitely many elements and let E be a set of non–empty subsets of X with the property ⋃ E∈E E = X . (We do not introduce an index set for E in order to keep the notations simple). For n ∈ N, the set of natural numbers, we define the cartesian product spaces Xn = ∏n 1 X and En = ∏n 1 E . The elements of En can be viewed as subsets of Xn. We say that E ′ n ⊂ En covers Xn or is a covering of Xn, if Xn = ⋃ En∈E′ n En. We are interested in obtaining bounds on the numbers c(n) defined by c(n) = min E′ n covers Xn |E ′ n|, n ∈ N. (1) Clearly, c(n1 + n2) ≤ c(n1) · c(n2) for n1, n2 ∈ N. Example 1 below shows that equality does not hold in general. Denote by Q the set of all probability distributions on the finite set E , denote by 1E(·) the indicator function of a set E, and define K by K = max q∈Q min x∈X ∑	cartesian closed category;characteristic function (convex analysis);maxima and minima;spaces	Rudolf Ahlswede	2006		10.1007/11889342_58	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics	Theory	32.96195191950746	28.184579609629527	120957

The Terwilliger algebra T  Tx is the subalgebra of MatX C generated by A, E 0 , E 1 ; . . . ;E D, where A denotes the adjacency matrix for G and E i denotes the projection onto the i subconstituent of G with respect to x. An irreducible T-module W is said to be thin whenever dimE i W U 1 for 0U i UD. The endpoint of W is minfi jE i W 0 0g. We determine the structure of the (unique) irreducible T -module of endpoint 0 in terms of the intersection numbers of G. We show that up to isomorphism there is a unique irreducible T-module of endpoint 1 and it is thin. We determine its structure in terms of the intersection numbers of G. We determine the structure of each thin irreducible T-module W of endpoint 2 in terms of the intersection numbers of G and an additional real parameter c  cW , which we refer to as the type of W . We now assume each irreducible T-module of endpoint 2 is thin and obtain the following two-fold result. First, we show that the intersection numbers of G are determined by the diameter D of G and the set of ordered pairs fc;multcjc A F2g; where F2 denotes the set of distinct types of irreducible T-modules with endpoint 2, and where multc denotes the multiplicity with which the module of type c appears in the standard module.

Combining the above two results, we conclude that if every irreducible T-module of endpoint 2 is thin, then the intersection numbers of G are determined by the diameter D of G , the intersection numbers k, b2, b3 of G, and the spectrum of G 2 2 . * This paper is based upon research supported under a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship 1. Introduction to Part I Let G  X ;E denote a bipartite distance-regular graph with diameter DV 4 (formal de®nitions appear in Section 2 below), and ®x a vertex x of G . The Terwilliger algebra T  Tx of G with respect to x is the subalgebra of MatX C generated by A, E 0 , E 1 ; . . . ;E D, where A is the adjacency matrix for G , and where E i denotes the projection onto the i th subconstituent of G with respect to x. An irreducible T-module W is said to be thin whenever dimE i W U 1 for 0U i UD. The endpoint of W is minfi jE i W 0 0g. The diameter of W is jfi j 0U i UD; E i W 0 0gj ÿ 1. This paper contains the following results. We begin with a description of the (unique) irreducible T-module of endpoint 0, which is known to be thin and have diameter D [4, Lemma 3.6]. We ®nd an orthogonal basis for this module (Theorem 5.4) and describe the action of T on this basis (Lemmas 5.2 and 5.3). Next, we study the irreducible T-modules of endpoint 1. We show that up to isomorphism there is a unique irreducible T-module of endpoint 1 (Corollary 7.7(i)). This module is thin (Theorem 7.6), has diameter Dÿ 2 (Theorem 7.6), and appears with multiplicity k ÿ 1 in the standard module (Corollary 7.7(ii)). We ®nd an orthogonal basis for the module of endpoint 1 (Theorem 7.6) and describe the action of T on this basis (Lemma 7.3, Corollary 7.4). In general the irreducible T-modules of endpoint 2 are not so well behaved. There may be many nonisomorphic irreducible T-modules of endpoint 2, they need not be thin, and their diameter can vary. In Part II we will study the irreducible T-modules of endpoint 2, focusing on those which are thin. We will then study the bipartite distance-regular graphs for which every irreducible T-module of endpoint 2 is thin.	adjacency matrix;communication endpoint;distance-regular graph;dual independent map encoding;existential quantification;irreducibility;microatx;ordered pair;urban dictionary;vertex (graph theory)	Brian Curtin	1999	Graphs and Combinatorics	10.1007/s003730050049	spectrum;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;intersection number;metric;distance-regular graph;mathematics;adjacency matrix	Theory	33.08568302922125	29.542083121667304	121629

We employ exhaustively generated networks and demonstrate that our defined graph measures based on the moduli of the zeros of permanental polynomials are quite efficient when distinguishing graphs structurally. In this work, we continue with a line of research that relates to the search of almost complete graph invariants. These highly unique network measures may serve as a powerful tool for tackling graph isomorphism.	polynomial	Matthias Dehmer;Frank Emmert-Streib;Bo Hu;Yongtang Shi;Monica Stefu;Shailesh Tripathi	2017	Inf.

Wheeler, the authors wish to point out that Lemma 1 is incorrect. The reason for this error is because we used a necessary condition for proving planarity. As a result, the phylogenetic networks that we consider are not necessarily planar. Other results in the manuscript remain unaffected in the absence of this lemma. A sufficient condition for planarity of a graph is given by Kuratowski’s theorem (Kuratowski, 1930) as follows. A subdivision of a graph results from inserting vertices into edges. Theorem 1 (Kuratowski’s theorem): A finite graph is planar if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on six vertices, three of which connect to each of the other three). Indeed it would be possible to obtain a phylogenetic network by adding edges and vertices to K3,3 and directing the edges. A good exercise would then be to obtain phylogenetic network(s) with the minimum number of vertices. We noted earlier in the conclusion of the paper that it has been proven in Hartvigsen (1998) that the hardwired problem is polynomially solvable. In view of this, it would be a worthwhile effort to characterize planar phylogenetic networks. It would be possible to obtain an algorithm for computing the hardwired score on planar phylogenetic networks, perhaps similar to Fitch algorithm (Fitch, 1971) for phylogenetic trees. Acknowledgment: We thank Mike Steel for rightly pointing out the error that was committed in proving Lemma 1. This went unnoticed until publication. We also assure the readers that the results in the paper are unaffected because of the error, for planarity is not used in any of the results.	acknowledgment index;algorithm;computation;decision problem;dynamic programming;fitch notation;graph (discrete mathematics);journal of computational biology;maximum parsimony (phylogenetics);occam's razor;phylogenesis;phylogenetic network;phylogenetic tree;phylogenetics;planar graph;subdivision surface;vertex (geometry)		2014	Journal of Computational Biology	10.1089/cmb.2014.Cor1		Theory	32.135770668021195	28.032893950069624	122823

Let P1,P2, . . . ,Pn be properties of graphs. A graph G is (P1,P2, . . . ,Pn)-partitionable if the vertex set V (G) can be partitioned into n sets, {V1, V2, . . . , Vn}, such that for each i = 1, 2, . . . , n, the graph G[Vi] ∈ Pi. We write P1◦P2◦ · · · ◦Pn for the property of all graphs which have a (P1,P2, . . . ,Pn)-partition. An additive inducedhereditary propertyR is called reducible if there exist additive inducedhereditary properties P1 and P2 such that R = P1◦P2. Otherwise R is called irreducible. An additive induced-hereditary property P can be defined by its minimal forbidden induced subgraphs: those graphs which are not in P but which satisfy that every proper induced subgraph is in P. We show that every reducible additive inducedhereditary property has infinitely many minimal forbidden induced subgraphs. This result is also seen to be true for reducible additive hereditary properties.	existential quantification;forbidden graph characterization;forbidden subgraph problem;graph (discrete mathematics);graph property;hereditary property;induced subgraph;irreducibility;utility functions on indivisible goods	Amelie J.

a55fc99b4eceff0e2dd4a3ce742fb05b7ba985c2	a simple approach for lower-bounding the distortion in any hyperbolic embedding		We answer open questions of [Verbeek and Suri, SOCGu002714] on the relationships between Gromov hyperbolicity and the optimal stretch of graph embeddings in Hyperbolic space. Then, based on the relationships between hyperbolicity and Cops and Robber games, we turn necessary conditions for a graph to be Cop-win into sufficient conditions for a graph to have a large hyperbolicity (and so, no low-stretch embedding in Hyperbolic space). In doing so we derive lower-bounds on the hyperbolicity in various graph classes – such as Cayley graphs, distance-regular graphs and generalized polygons, to name a few. It partly fills in a gap in the literature on Gromov hyperbolicity, for which few lower-bound techniques are known.	distortion	David Coudert;Guillaume Ducoffe	2017	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2017.06.051	combinatorics;mathematics;hyperbolic group;discrete mathematics;polygon;topology;distortion;embedding;graph;cayley graph;hyperbolic space	Theory	33.05889586078547	26.788076744866263	123720

The large cardinal hypothesis on λ is necessary, as we further demonstrate by constructing via forcing two distinct models in which either A1 = ∅ or A2 = ∅.

It is shown that if δ has the tree property then δ +K = δ + and δ is weakly compact in K. Let ¬L strong denote the assumption that there is no transitive (set or proper class sized) model of ZF C + there is a strong cardinal. We have shown in [9] (cf. Theorem 5) that K c correctly computes successors of weakly compact cardinals, provided that ¬L stong holds. Here, K c is the countably complete core model below a strong cardinal. In fact, a straightforward adaptation of the argument given in [9] also yields that K, the true core model below a strong cardinal, has the same weak covering property. (Schimmerling had earlier proved this for the core model below a Woodin cardinal, cf. [7]. See [3], [8], or [11] on the theory of K c and K.) The purpose of this note is to prove a more general result, namely the following Theorem. If ¬L strong holds then δ +K = δ + for every cardinal δ having the tree property, and such a δ is weakly compact in K. A cardinal δ is said to have the tree property if there is no Aronszajn δ-tree, i.e., if every tree of height δ whose levels all have size less than δ has a cofinal branch. It is elementary that ω has the tree property but ω 1 does * 1991 Mathematics subject classification: 03E35, 03E45, and 03E55. † The author gratefully acknowledges a grant of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)	aronszajn tree;german research centre for artificial intelligence;mathematics subject classification;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Ralf Schindler	1999	Arch.

They have been developed by many authors since, for various combinatorial objects such as strings, subsets, permutations, partitions, vector spaces, and designs. One generalization of universal cycles, which require almost complete overlap of consecutive words, is s-overlap cycles, which relax such a constraint. In this paper we study weak orders, which are relations that are transitive and complete. We prove the existence of universal and s-overlap cycles for weak orders, as well as for fixed height and/or weight weak orders, and apply the results to cycles for ordered partitions as well.	code;de bruijn graph;freedman–diaconis rule;graham scan;resource bounded measure;string (computer science)	Victoria Horan;Glenn H.

Let π : Σ → Γ be a function between finite alphabets Σ and Γ , and let V, H ⊆ Σ ×Σ be binary relations over Σ. Given a picture N over Γ , the picture satisfiability problem consists in determining whether there exists a picture M over Σ such that π(Mij) = Nij , and such that the constraints imposed by V and H on adjacent vertical and horizontal positions of M are respectively satisfied. This problem can be easily shown to be NP-complete. In this work we introduce the notion of s-smooth picture. Our main result states the satisfiability problem for s-smooth pictures can be solved in time polynomial on s and on the size of the input picture. With each picture N , one can naturally associate a CNF formula F (N) which is satisfiable if and only if N is satisfiable. In our second result, we define an infinite family of unsatisfiable pictures which intuitively encodes the pigeonhole principle. We show that this family of pictures is polynomially smooth. In contrast we show that the formulas which naturally arise from these pictures are hard for boundeddepth Frege proof systems. This shows that there are families of pictures for which our algorithm for the satisfiability for smooth pictures performs exponentially better than certain classical variants of SAT solvers based on the technique of conflict-driven clause-learning (CDCL).	algorithm;boolean satisfiability problem;conflict-driven clause learning;conjunctive normal form;frege;np-completeness;pigeonhole sort;polynomial	Mateus de Oliveira Oliveira	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-40970-2_2	computer science;pigeonhole principle;pi;combinatorics;matrix (mathematics);topology;satisfiability;exponential growth;boolean satisfiability problem;binary relation;polynomial	Logic	34.42357443437239	28.778520657807427	125558

The skeleton describes the topological structure of a network. The constitutive relation describes the physical properties assigned to its branch set. The behavior of a network is defined as the set of all signal pairs obeying its constitutive relation and both Kirchhoff's laws. Multipoles are introduced as ordered pairs consisting of a network and a family of terminal classes. The terminal classes are disjoint subsets of the node set of the corresponding network. Multiports are defined as multipoles whose terminal classes contain exactly two nodes. Based on these concepts a general theory of the terminal behavior of multipoles is developed.	kirchhoff's circuit laws;kirchhoff's theorem;obedience (human behavior);ordered pair	Albrecht Reibiger	2013	2013 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;geometry;network topology;quantum mechanics	Robotics	35.291476120977975	28.72738911003023	125613

We prove that, under the above hypothesis, for k I> 6, a binary matroid will also have a 6-element set that is the intersection of a circuit and a cocircuit. In addition, we determine explicitly the regular matroids which do not have a 6-element set that is the intersection of a circuit and cocircuit. Finally, we prove that in the case of graphs, if for some k 1> 4, a circuit and a cocircuit intersect in k elements, then there must be a circuit and a cocircuit that intersect in (k 2) elements. @ 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

There exists a product formula which enumerates these objects according to type. We define a notion of ‘connectivity’ for these objects and prove an analogous product formula which counts connected objects by type. Our proof of this product formula is combinatorial and bijective. We extend this to a product formula which counts objects with a fixed type and number of connected components. We relate our product formulas to symmetric functions arising from parking functions. We close by presenting an alternative proof of our product formulas communicated to us by Christian Krattenthaler [7] which uses generating functions and Lagrange inversion.	connected component (graph theory);dyck language;euler–lagrange equation	Brendon Rhoades	2011	Eur.

2a89ef07a65fb035236d9eaf7e24f137ae5ddf86	minimum number of monotone subsequences of length 4 in permutations	qa mathematics	We show that for every sufficiently large n, the number of monotone subsequences of length four in a permutation on n points is at least (bn/3c 4 ) + (b(n+1)/3c 4 ) + (b(n+2)/3c 4 ) . Furthermore, we characterize all permutations on [n] that attain this lower bound. The proof uses the flag algebra framework together with some additional stability arguments. This problem is equivalent to some specific type of edge colorings of complete graphs with two colors, where the number of monochromatic K4’s is minimized. We show that all the extremal colorings must contain monochromatic K4’s only in one of the two colors. This translates back to permutations, where all the monotone subsequences of length four are all either increasing, or decreasing only.	color;edge coloring;extremal optimization;monochrome;monotone polygon	József Balogh;Ping Hu;Bernard Lidický;Oleg Pikhurko;Balázs Udvari;Jan Volec	2015	Combinatorics, Probability & Computing	10.1017/S0963548314000820	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics	Theory	34.11310677834032	29.151526338854435	128465

A vertexmagic total labeling is a bijection from V (G) ∪ E(G) to the consecutive integers 1, 2, . . . , p + q, with the property that, for every vertex u in V (G), one has f (u) +  uv∈E(G) f (uv) = k for some constant k.

In the imprimitive cases an unknown graph must have a primitive core of diameter at least two and valency at least three. It seems that the known list of primitive graphs is complete.

898f76f83e6cfd4d77b53148bb92bb363e5c4f5d	decompositions of the boolean lattice into rank-symmetric chains	chain decompositions;boolean lattice	The Boolean lattice 2[n] is the power set of [n] ordered by inclusion. A chain c0 ⊂ · · · ⊂ ck in 2[n] is rank-symmetric, if |ci|+ |ck−i| = n for i = 0, . . . , k; and it is symmetric, if |ci| = (n− k)/2 + i. We prove that there exist a bijection p : [n] → [n] and a partial ordering < on [n](>n/2) satisfying the following properties: • ⊂ is an extension of < on [n](>n/2); • if C ⊂ [n](>n/2) is a chain with respect to <, then p(C)∪C is a rank-symmetric chain in 2[n], where p(C) = {p(x) : x ∈ C}; • the poset ([n](>n/2), <) has the so called normalized matching property. We show two applications of this result. A conjecture of Füredi asks if 2[n] can be partitioned into ( n bn/2c ) chains such that the size of any two chains differ by at most 1. We prove an asymptotic version of this conjecture with the additional condition that every chain in the partition is rank-symmetric: 2[n] can be partitioned into ( n bn/2c ) rank-symmetric chains, each of size Θ( √ n). Our second application gives a lower bound for the number of symmetric chain partitions of 2[n]. We show that 2[n] has at least 2Ω(2n logn/ √ n) symmetric chain partitions.	boolean algebra;existential quantification;symmetric multiprocessing	István Tomon	2016	Electr. J.

The ball Br(v) denotes the vertices within graphical distance r from v. A subset C ⊆ V is called an (r,≤ l)-locating-dominating code of type B if the sets Ir(F ) = ⋃ v∈F (Br(v)∩C) are distinct for all subsets F ⊆ V \C with at most l vertices. A subset C ⊆ V is an (r,≤ l)-locatingdominating code of type A if sets Ir(F1) and Ir(F2) are distinct for all subsets F1, F2 ⊆ V where F1 = F2, F1 ∩ C = F2 ∩ C and |F1|, |F2| ≤ l. We study (r,≤ l)-locating-dominating codes in the infinite king grid when r ≥ 1 and l ≥ 3. The infinite king grid is the graph with vertex set Z and edge set {{(x1, y1), (x2, y2)} | |x1 − x2| ≤ 1, |y1 − y2| ≤ 1}.	code;graph (discrete mathematics);graphical user interface;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Mikko Pelto	2011	Australasian J.

Equivalently, we find the (n− k)-regular subgraphs of Kn,n which have the greatest number of perfect matchings, and the (0, 1)-matrices with exactly k zeroes in every row and column which maximise the permanent. Without the restriction on n being a multiple of k we solve the above problem (and the corresponding minimisation problem) for k = 2.

Theorem 1 Suppose that λ is a singular cardinal, λ′ < λ, and the ultrafilter D is κ-decomposable for all regular cardinals κ with λ′ < κ < λ. Then D is either λ-decomposable, or λ-decomposable. Corollary 2 If λ is a singular cardinal, then an ultrafilter is (λ, λ)regular if and only if it is either cf λ-decomposable or λ-decomposable. We give applications to topological spaces and to abstract logics (Corollaries 8, 9 and Theorem 10). If F is a family of subsets of some set I, and λ is an infinite cardinal, a λ-decomposition for F is a function f : I → λ such that whenever X ⊆ λ and |X| < λ then {i ∈ I|f(i) ∈ X} 6∈ F . The family F is λ-decomposable if and only if there is a λ-decomposition for F . If D is an ultrafilter (that is, a maximal proper filter) let us define the decomposability spectrum KD of D by KD = {λ ≥ ω|D is λ-decomposable}. The question of the possible values the spectrum KD may take is particularly intriguing. Even the old problem from [P; Si] of characterizing those cardinals μ for which there is an ultrafilter D such that KD = {ω, μ} is not yet completely solved [Shr, p. 1007]. The case when KD is infinite is even more involved. [P] studied the situation in which λ is limit and KD ∩ λ is unbounded in λ; he found some assumptions which imply that λ ∈ KD. This is not always the case; if μ is strongly compact and cf λ < μ < λ then there is an ultrafilter D such that KD ∩ λ is unbounded in λ, and D is not λ-decomposable.

These coefficients count the number of times a finite word appears as a subsequence of another finite word. The finite words occurring in this paper belong to the language of a Parry numeration system satisfying the Bertrand property, i.e., we can add or remove trailing zeroes to valid representations. It is a folklore fact that the Sierpiński gasket is the limit set, for the Hausdorff distance, of a convergent sequence of normalized compact blocks extracted from the classical Pascal triangle modulo 2. In a similar way, we describe and study the subset of [0, 1] × [0, 1] associated with the latter generalization of the Pascal triangle modulo a prime number. 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification: 11A63, 11A67, 11B65, 11K16, 68R15.

By a positional game we shall mean a game played by two players on { A   i  }. The players alternately pick elements of  S  and that player wins who fist has all the elements of one of the  A   i  . This paper deals with almost disjoint hypergraphs only, i.e., | A   i  ∪ A   j  | ⩽ 1 if  i  ≠  j . Let   M     ∗   (n)   be the smallest integer for which there is an almost disjoint  n -uniform hypergraph   |T| = M     ∗   (n)  , so that the first player has a winning strategy. It is shown that   lim     n    [M     ∗   (n)]      1  n     = 4  , which was conjectured by Erdos. The same method is applied to prove a conjecture of Hales and Jewett on  r -dimensional tick-tack-toe if  r  is large enough. Finally we prove that for an arbitrary almost disjoint  n -uniform hypergraph the second player has such a strategy that the first player unable to win in his  m th move if  m   ϵ )  n  .

Using a difficult construction, Du and Wang showed that these conditions are also sufficient, but left open the corresponding conjecture for complete multigraphs λ K m , n . In this paper we reformulate the problem to make it more tractable in individual cases. Using this new approach we prove the multigraph conjecture; our proof yields a much simpler proof for the original case λ = 1 .

We prove almost matching lower and upper bounds on the density of a set required to guarantee the existence of a d-dimensional projection. We also prove almost tight upper and lower bounds on the dimension of monochromatic projections in arbitrary Boolean functions. We then prove almost tight upper and lower bounds on the dimension of monochromatic projections in Boolean functions represented by low degree GF(2) polynomials. It follows from these lower bounds that low-degree GF(2) polynomials can define Boolean functions which are close to being extremal with respect to the property of having no large dimensional monochromatic projections.	boolean algebra;monochrome;polynomial	Ramamohan Paturi;Francis Zane	1998	SIAM J.

Considering that graphic structures can be used to describe the crossing of edges in an m-polar fuzzy multi-graph with certain amount of m-polar fuzzy planarity value, first of all the notion of m-polar fuzzy multi-set is introduced. Then m-polar fuzzy multi-graphs, m-polar fuzzy planar graphs and m-polar fuzzy strong edges are defined. Several properties of m-polar fuzzy planar graphs are also studied.	artificial neural network;fuzzy set;geographic information system;graph theory;planar graph;printed circuit board;soft computing;user-generated content;vagueness	Ganesh Ghorai;Madhumangal Pal	2016	IJCSM	10.1504/IJCSM.2016.077854	1-planar graph;pathwidth;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;dense graph;fuzzy number;planar straight-line graph;mathematics;chordal graph;indifference graph;book embedding	Theory	35.43449662426942	28.003078530233566	139163

However, there is no standardized formal definition of dC for a network. We consider various possible definitions of dC for a finite unweighted and undirected rectilinear grid in one, two, and three dimensions. We propose a simple “overall slope” definition for dC which yields an exact closed form expression for such grids. We prove that the overall slope definition satisfies two properties that should be satisfied by any definition of the correlation dimension of a network. Lastly, we present a conjecture giving a closed form expression for the overall slope correlation dimension of a finite rectilinear grid in E dimensions, for any positive integer E.	correlation dimension;regular grid	Eric Rosenberg	2016	Journal of Interconnection Networks	10.1142/S0219265915500103	correlation dimension;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;effective dimension;computer science;mathematics;fractal dimension;minkowski–bouligand dimension;complex network	HPC	34.527086904060724	27.167481587065744	139354

In 1990, Tuza asked for which graphs F and large t, one has that st(F ) is exponential in a power of t. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, the only such F are complete graphs, and for every F which is not complete, st(F ) is polynomial in t. Further, for a natural strengthening of the local condition above, we also characterise those F for which st(F ) is exponential in a power of t.

5b83f185a9210faac11e71a7533bc139b0763e75	a complete grammar for decomposing a family of graphs into 3-connected components	asymptotic enumeration;stability condition;canonical decomposition;connected component;planar graph;limit laws	Tutte has described in the book “Connectivity in graphs” a canonical decomposition of any graph into 3-connected components. In this article we translate (using the language of symbolic combinatorics) Tutte’s decomposition into a general grammar expressing any family G of graphs (with some stability conditions) in terms of the subfamily G3 of graphs in G that are 3-connected (until now, such a general grammar was only known for the decomposition into 2-connected components). As a byproduct, our grammar yields an explicit system of equations to express the series counting a (labelled) family of graphs in terms of the series counting the subfamily of 3-connected graphs. A key ingredient we use is an extension of the so-called dissymmetry theorem, which yields negative signs in the grammar and associated equation system, but has the considerable advantage of avoiding the difficult integration steps that appear with other approaches, in particular in recent work by Giménez and Noy on counting planar graphs. As a main application we recover in a purely combinatorial way the analytic expression found by Giménez and Noy for the series counting labelled planar graphs (such an expression is crucial to do asymptotic enumeration and to obtain limit laws of various parameters on random planar graphs). Besides the grammar, an important ingredient of our method is a recent bijective construction of planar maps by Bouttier, Di Francesco and Guitter. Finally, our grammar applies also to the case of unlabelled structures, since the dissymetry theorem takes symmetries into account. Even if there are still difficulties in counting unlabelled 3-connected planar graphs, we think that our grammar is a promising tool toward the asymptotic enumeration of unlabelled planar graphs, since it circumvents some difficult integral calculations. : LIX, École Polytechnique, Paris, France. chapuy@lix.polytechnique.fr : Dept.

194b0aa51f90b79150fe760885bf0fea16090da6	local and union boxicity		The boxicity box(H) of a graph H is the smallest integer d such that H is the intersection of d interval graphs, or equivalently, that H is the intersection graph of axis-aligned boxes in R. These intersection representations can be interpreted as covering representations of the complement H of H with co-interval graphs, that is, complements of interval graphs. We follow the recent framework of global, local and folded covering numbers (Knauer and Ueckerdt, Discrete Mathematics 339 (2016)) to define two new parameters: the local boxicity box`(H) and the union boxicity box(H) of H. The union boxicity of H is the smallest d such that H can be covered with d vertex-disjoint unions of co-interval graphs, while the local boxicity of H is the smallest d such that H can be covered with co-interval graphs, at most d at every vertex. We show that for every graph H we have box`(H) ≤ box(H) ≤ box(H) and that each of these inequalities can be arbitrarily far apart. Moreover, we show that local and union boxicity are also characterized by intersection representations of appropriate axis-aligned boxes in R. We demonstrate with a few striking examples, that in a sense, the local boxicity is a better indication for the complexity of a graph, than the classical boxicity.	apache axis;boxicity;discrete mathematics	Thomas Bläsius;Peter Stumpf;Torsten Ueckerdt	2018	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2018.02.003	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;boxicity;mathematics;geometry	Theory	33.35224592599209	26.676639403981383	141125

We say n is the size of the partition, ai is the ith part of the partition and we call p(n) the number of partitions of n. For instance the 11 partitions of n = 6 are 6, 15, 24, 33, 222, 123, 114, 1113, 1122, 11112 and 111111, i.e., p(6) = 11. We define an ascent of size d or more whenever ai+1 ≥ ai + d. In this paper we aim to look at the distribution of the number of ascents of size d or more in the partitions of n. The case for d = 0, equivalent to the number of parts in partitions of n, was first studied by P. Erdős and J. Lehner in [5]. Henceforth we will restrict our attention to the case where d ≥ 1.	erdős number;times ascent	Charlotte A. C. Brennan;Arnold Knopfmacher;Stephan G.

We show that ∆ACY G is homotopy equivalent to the (n−1−k)-dimensional sphere if G is a disjoint union of k strongly connected graphs. Otherwise, it is contractible. If G belongs to a certain class of graphs, the homotopy type of ∆NSC G is shown to be a wedge of (2n − 4)-dimensional spheres. The number of spheres can easily be read off the chromatic polynomial of a certain associated undirected graph. We also consider some consequences related to finite topologies and hyperplane arrangements.	chromatic polynomial;directed acyclic graph;directed graph;graph (discrete mathematics);nondeterministic finite automaton;simplicial complex;strongly connected component	Axel Hultman	2004	Electr.

In particular, it implied that there is no tournament with a partition A,B of its vertex set, such that every transitive subset of A is in the out-neighbour set of some vertex in B, and vice versa. But in fact there is such a tournament, as we show in this paper, and so Schwartz’ conjecture is false.

d8223aadf57a92431c5feca19ca29a6fd32a817b	on the existence of indiscernible trees	netcommons;cms;maple	We introduce several concepts concerning the indiscernibility of trees. A tree is by definition an ordered set (O,<) such that, for any a ∈ O, the initial segment {b ∈ O : b < a} determined by a is a linearly ordered set. A typical example of a tree is the set ω of finite ω-sequences with the order relation <ini, where η <ini ν means that η is a proper initial segment of ν. In this paper, we consider some structure M in the language L and are interested in sets A of the form (aη)η∈O, where O is a tree, and aη labeled by η is an element in M . Such a set A is also called a tree in this paper. We study the indiscernibility of trees A in general settings and apply the obtained results to the study of unstable theories.

Similarly for dκ,λ,μ, the general dominating number, which is the smallest size of a subset B of λμ such that for every g ∈ λμ there is an f ∈ B such that the above set has size less than κ . These cardinals are generalizations of the usual ones for κ = λ = μ = ω. When all three are the same regular cardinal, the relationships between them have been completely described by Cummings and Shelah. We also consider some variants of the functions, following van Douwen, in particular the version b ↑ κ,λ,μ of bκ,λ,μ in which B is required to consist of strictly increasing functions. Some of the main results of this paper are: (1) bμ,μ,cfμ ≤ bcfμ,cfμ,cfμ; (2) for λ ≤ μ, b ↑ κ,λ,μ always exists; (3) if cfλ = cfμ < λ ≤ μ, then bcfμ,cfμ,cfμ = b ↑ λ,λ,μ; (4) dω,μ,μ = d1,μ,μ. For background see Section 1 of the paper. Several open problems are stated. 1 Definitions We make the standing assumptions that we have cardinals κ, λ,μ with (1) κ = 1 or κ is infinite, (2) κ ≤ λ, and (3) λ and μ are infinite. Note in particular that we allow for the possibility that λ > μ. The definitions of our functions depend on some quasi orders defined as follows. For f, g ∈ μ we write f ≤κ g iff |{ξ < λ : f (ξ) > g(ξ)}| < κ, f <κ g iff |{ξ < λ : f (ξ) ≥ g(ξ)}| < κ, f ≤ g iff ∀ξ < λ[ f (ξ) ≤ g(ξ)], f < g iff ∀ξ < λ[ f (ξ) < g(ξ)].

This improves a previous result of Betten et al. (Discrete Math. 197/198 (1999) 83–109). c © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. We use the notation and terminology of [1] and assume that the reader is familiar with the concept of graphical t-designs [2]. All polynomials in this note are polynomials in n. Betten et al. [1, Theorem 10] have shown that there exist only """"nitely many nontrivial graphical t-(( 2 ); k; ) designs when k = t+1. In this note, we show that this """"niteness result remains true when the condition k = t + 1 is relaxed to k 6 4t=3. Let t ¿ 3 and k 6 4t=3. Let I(t) denote the graph consisting of t independent edges and de""""ne K to be the set of all graphs, each having k edges and contains I(t) as a subgraph. Then if G ∈ K, G must contain at least t=3 isolated edges. By Alltop’s Lemma (see [1, Lemma 2]), the entry in row G and column H of the polynomial Kramer–Mesner matrix is a polynomial whose degree is the di@erence in the sizes of the supports of G and H . Hence, the entry in row I(t) and column I(k) of the polynomial Kramer–Mesner matrix is a polynomial of degree 2(k − t). The other entries in row I(t) are polynomials of degree strictly less than 2(k − t). Without loss of generality, assume that I(k) is a block of a graphical t-(( 2 ); k; ) design D. The columns indexed by graphs in K\{I(k)} each has an entry a polynomial of degree 2(k − t), precisely in the row indexed by the graph obtained by removing k − t 6 t=3 isolated edges from the graph indexing the corresponding column. Hence for large n, all graphs in K\{I(k)} must also be blocks of D. This forces D to be the complete design and establishes the following result. ∗ Corresponding author. 12 Jambol Place, Singapore 119339, Singapore. E-mail address: ymchee@coolconnect.com (Y.M.

In a graph representation of f, the set of vertices denotes the set of legal sequences off. Note that, if u is a legal sequence off, thm every subsequence of u is also a legal aequmce of f. This is obvious from the definition of legal aequmces. Furthermore, the null sequence A is always a legal sequmce of any learning system f. From the above discussion it is concluded that a legal sequence u, with length n, detines n vertices of the graph. The edges of the gmph represent the “immediate follows” relation of the s-r pairs in a legal sequmce. Thus, the sequence u is represented by the following digraph: A (sl,r,) (sl,r,)(~,r~ u *-_ > *___– > *___ >*.. *_._>* In an alternative way, a can be represmted by a labeled digraph with the s-r pairs as its edge labels @ 193 AN 0d9791—SW2@MKBM4M9.JISl 469 (s,,r,, (s2,rJ (~,rJ (~,rJ *._>*_ >*_>*,... *_>* The graph representation of f c4msi* of the union of the graphs that represent the legal sequences off.

The above relation is an equivakmt relation and therefore &finea equivalence classes of legal sequences (vertices). A mapping that maps a vertex to its equivalent class is a homommphic mapping and therefore it defines an induced relation among the equivalence classes from the relation of the vertices. Thus, a new graph can be derived from the original graph with vertices representing equivalence classes of the original vertices and with edges denoting the induced relation among the classes. The new graph is a reduced graph representation off.

Furthermore, we improve an exponentially growing lower bound on the chromatic number of distance graphs with large girth. These refinements are obtained by improving known upper bounds on the product of cardinalities of two families of homogeneous subsets with one forbidden cross-intersection.

941d0534ce3845a1352014b2d9f3dbe69326dc0f	chromatic graphs, ramsey numbers and the flexible atom conjecture	complete graph;ramsey number	Let KN denote the complete graph on N vertices with vertex set V = V (KN ) and edge set E = E(KN ). For x, y ∈ V , let xy denote the edge between the two vertices x and y. Let L be any finite set and M ⊆ L3. Let c : E → L. Let [n] denote the integer set {1, 2, . . . , n}. For x, y, z ∈ V , let c(xyz) denote the ordered triple (c(xy), c(yz), c(xz)). We say that c is good with respect to M if the following conditions obtain: (i) ∀x, y ∈ V and ∀(c(xy), j, k) ∈ M, ∃z ∈ V such that c(xyz) = (c(xy), j, k); (ii) ∀x, y, z ∈ V , c(xyz) ∈ M; and (iii) ∀x ∈ V ∀` ∈ L ∃ y ∈ V such that c(xy) = `. We investigate particular subsets M ⊆ L3 and those edge colorings of KN which are good with respect to these subsets M. We also remark on the connections of these subsets and colorings to projective planes, Ramsey theory, and representations of relation algebras. In particular, we prove a special case of the flexible atom conjecture. 1 Motivation and background Let KN denote the complete graph on N vertices with vertex set V = V (KN) and edge set E = E(KN). For x, y ∈ V , let xy denote the edge between the two vertices x and the electronic journal of combinatorics 15 (2008), #R49 1 y. Let L be any finite set and M ⊆ L. Let c : E → L. Let [n] denote the integer set {1, 2, . . . , n}. For x, y, z ∈ V , let c(xyz) denote the ordered triple (c(xy), c(yz), c(xz)). We say that c is good with respect to M if the following conditions obtain: (i) ∀x, y ∈ V and ∀(c(xy), j, k) ∈ M, ∃z ∈ V such that c(xyz) = (c(xy), j, k); (ii) ∀x, y, z ∈ V , c(xyz) ∈ M; and (iii) ∀x ∈ V ∀` ∈ L ∃ y ∈ V such that c(xy) = `. If K = KN has a coloring c which is good with respect to M, then we say that K realizes M (or that M is realizable). If we take Rα = {(x, y) : c(xy) = α}, and let | stand for ordinary composition of binary relations, ie. Rα|Rβ := {(x, z) : ∃y (x, y) ∈ Rα, (y, z) ∈ Rβ}, then conditions (i) and (ii) imply (Rα|Rβ) ∩ Rγ 6= ∅ =⇒ Rγ ⊆ Rα|Rβ. Conditions (i) (iii) are given in [1] where the author calls a coloring on KN that realizes some M a symmetric color scheme. It is proved in [2] that if M is a set of triples that is closed under permutation such that there is at least one α ∈ L such that for all β, γ ∈ L, (α, β, γ) ∈ M, then M is realized by a coloring on Kω, the complete graph on countably many vertices. Any such color α is called a flexible color, since it can participate in any triple. Conditions (i) (iii) may seem quite stringent, but in fact these conditions are satisfied in many natural situations. Recall the notation for the Ramsey numbers; that is, R(k1, k2, . . . , k`) is the minimum integer n such that in any `-coloring of the edges of Kn there is a monochromatic complete graph on kj vertices in color j for some j. In particular, the coloring of K5 which shows R(3, 3) ≥ 6 satisfies (i) (iii), as does the coloring of K8 which shows R(4, 3) ≥ 9, the colorings of K16 that show R(3, 3, 3) ≥ 17, both “twisted” and “untwisted”, and the coloring of K29 given in [7] and [4] that shows that R(4, 3, 3) ≥ 30. In fact, the coloring of K5 without monochromatic triangles is a realization of M0 = {(r, b, b), (b, r, b), (b, b, r), (r, r, b), (r, b, r), (b, r, r)}. The coloring of K8 mentioned above is a realization of M = M0 ∪ {(r, r, r)}; the col orings of K16 are realizations of M = {r, b, g}\{(r, r, r), (b, b, b), (g, g, g)}; the coloring of K29 is a realization of M = {r, b, g}\{(b, b, b), (g, g, g)}. In [1], Comer introduces the number r(k) which is the largest N such that there is a coloring on KN that realizes M = { r1, ..., rk} \{(ri, ri, ri) : i ∈ [k]}. Clearly, r(k) ≤ R( k times { }} { 3, 3, . . . , 3)−1; equality holds for k = 2 and k = 3. An interesting open problem is whether equality holds for all values of k. the electronic journal of combinatorics 15 (2008), #R49 2 Realizations of color schemes arise in connection with projective planes as well. Let L = {r1, . . . , r`}, and let M` = {(ri, rj, rk) : |{i, j, k}| ∈ {1, 3}} . Lyndon proved in [5] that M` is realizable in some complete graph if and only if there exists a projective plane of order `−1, for ` > 2. This result has been extremely important in the theory of relation algebras. In [3], Maddux, Jipsen and Tuza show that for M = L, KN realizes M for arbitrarily large finite N . In the case when M = L, every color in L is a flexible color.	amd k5;atom;color;douglas comer;emoticon;graph coloring;monochrome;ramsey's theorem;twisted;vertex (geometry)	Jeremy F. Alm;Roger D.

13ecd048a8e91df5ac7cd70efe7f52921c632d77	a counterexample to thiagarajan's conjecture on regular event structures		We provide a counterexample to a conjecture by Thiagarajan (1996 and 2002) that regular prime event structures correspond exactly to finite 1-safe Petri nets. The same counterexample is used to disprove a closely related conjecture by Badouel, Darondeau, and Raoult (1999) that domains of regular event structures with bounded \-cliques are recognizable by finite trace automata. Event structures, trace automata, and Petri nets are fundamental models in concurrency theory. There exist nice interpretations of these structures as combinatorial and geometric objects and both conjectures can be reformulated in this framework. Namely, from a graph theoretical point of view, the domains of prime event structures correspond exactly to median graphs; from a geometric point of view, these domains are in bijection with CAT(0) cube complexes. A necessary condition for both conjectures to be true is that domains of respective regular event structures admit a regular nice labeling (which corresponds to a special coloring of the hyperplanes of the associated CAT(0) cube complex). To disprove these conjectures, we describe a regular event domain (with bounded \-cliques) that does not admit a regular nice labeling. Our counterexample is derived from an example by Wise (1996 and 2007) of a nonpositively curved square complex X with six squares, whose edges are colored in five colors, and whose universal cover X̃ is a CAT(0) square complex containing a particular plane with an aperiodic tiling.	automata theory;automaton;color;concurrency (computer science);covering space;graph coloring;median graph;petri net;tiling window manager	Jérémie Chalopin;Victor Chepoi	2017		10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2017.101	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;algorithm	Logic	34.70854678722938	27.696644409789528	146723
4032ea39eaa155724067b4ead25a6fc7da95b03c	on tours that contain all edges of a hypergraph		Let H be a k-uniform hypergraph, k > 2. By an Euler tour in H we mean an alternating sequence v0, e1, v1, e2, v2, . . . , vm−1, em, vm = v0 of vertices and edges in H such that each edge of H appears in this sequence exactly once and vi−1, vi ∈ ei, vi−1 6= vi, for every i = 1, 2, . . . ,m. This is an obvious generalization of the graph theoretic concept of an Euler tour. A straightforward necessary condition for existence of an Euler tour in a k-uniform hypergraph is |Vodd(H)| 6 (k − 2)|E(H)|, where Vodd(H) is the set of vertices of odd degrees in H and E(H) is the set of edges in H. In this paper we show that this condition is also sufficient for hypergraphs of a broad class of k-uniform hypergraphs, that we call strongly connected hypergraphs. This result reduces to the Euler theorem on existence of Euler tours, when k = 2, i.e. for graphs, and is quite simple to prove for k > 3. Therefore, we concentrate on the most interesting case of k = 3. In this case we further consider the problem of existence of an Euler tour in a certain class of 3-uniform hypergraphs containing the class of strongly connected hypergraphs as a proper subclass. For hypergraphs in this class we give a sufficient condition for existence of an Euler tour and prove intractability (NP-completeness) of the problem in this class in general.	euler method;eulerian path;euler–maclaurin formula;graph theory;np-completeness;strongly connected component;vertex (geometry);virtual tour	Zbigniew Lonc;Pawel Naroski	2010	Electr.

5b20cf563aba6cdc79faae91d27ef58463029b3f	special asteroidal quadruple on directed path graph non rooted path graph		An asteroidal triple in a graph G is a set of three nonadjacent vertices such that for any two of them there exists a path between them that does not intersect the neighborhood of the third. Special asteroidal triple in a graph G is an asteroidal triple such that each pair is linked by a special connection. A special asteroidal triples play a central role in a characterization of directed path graphs by Cameron, Hoáng and Lévêque [2]. They also introduce a related notion of asteroidal quadruple and conjecture a characterization of rooted path graphs [1]. In its original form this conjecture is not complete, still in leafage four, as was showed in [3]. But, as suggested by the conjecture, a characterization by forbidding particular types of asteroidal quadruples may hold. We prove that the conjecture in the original form is true on directed path graphs with leafage four having two minimal separators with multiplicity two. Thus we build the family of forbidden subgraphs in this case.	forbidden subgraph problem;path (graph theory);quadruple-precision floating-point format	Marisa Gutierrez;Silvia B.

7c3dda4d0abef60e3522d4c280f06f2beaaf5aee	algebraic methods proving sauer's bound for teaching complexity	sauer s bound;maximum classes;vc dimension;teaching	This paper establishes an upper bound on the size of a concept class with given recursive teaching dimension (RTD, a teaching complexity parameter). The upper bound coincides with Sauer’s well-known bound on classes with a fixed VC-dimension. Our result thus supports the recently emerging conjecture that the combinatorics of VC-dimension and those of teaching complexity are intrinsically interlinked. We further introduce and study RTD-maximum classes (whose size meets the upper bound) and RTDmaximal classes (whose RTD increases if a concept is added to them), showing similarities but also differences to the corresponding notions for VC-dimension. Another contribution is a set of new results on maximal classes of a given VC-dimension. Methodologically, our contribution is the successful application of algebraic techniques, which we use to obtain a purely algebraic characterization of teaching sets (sample sets that uniquely identify a concept in a given concept class) and to prove our analog of Sauer’s bound for RTD. Such techniques have been used before to prove results relevant to computational learning theory, e.g., by Smolensky (1997), but are not standard in the field.

Instead of considering several color interchanges along alternating chains (Vizing, Gupta), using counting arguments (Ehrenfeucht, Faber, Kierstead), or improving nonvalid colorings with Fournier's Lemma, the method of proof consists of using one single easy transformation, called “sequential recoloring”, to augment a partial k-coloring of the edges.	vadim g. vizing;vizing's theorem	Claude Berge;Jean-Claude Fournier	1991	Journal of Graph Theory	10.1002/jgt.3190150309	independence;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;multigraph;harmonic analysis;mathematics;matching	Theory	32.46534072165191	30.054834541899325	150045
04cab9ba587c0d1420611ccbfa9c64b68fdd2641	asymptotic enumeration of compacted binary trees		A compacted tree is a graph created from a binary tree such that repeatedly occurring subtrees in the original tree are represented by pointers to existing ones, and hence every subtree is unique. Such representations form a special class of directed acyclic graphs. We are interested in the asymptotic number of compacted trees of given size, where the size of a compacted tree is given by the number of its internal nodes. Due to its superexponential growth this problem poses many difficulties. Therefore we restrict our investigations to compacted trees of bounded right height, which is the maximal number of edges going to the right on any path from the root to a leaf. We solve the asymptotic counting problem for this class as well as a closely related, further simplified class. For this purpose, we develop a calculus on exponential generating functions for compacted trees of bounded right height and for relaxed trees of bounded right height, which differ from compacted trees by dropping the above described uniqueness condition. This enables us to derive a recursively defined sequence of differential equations for the exponential generating functions. The coefficients can then be determined by performing a singularity analysis of the solutions of these differential equations. Our main results are the computation of the asymptotic numbers of relaxed as well as compacted trees of bounded right height and given size, when the size tends to infinity.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;binary tree;coefficient;computable function;computation;computer science;converge;counting problem (complexity);data compaction;data structure;directed acyclic graph;graph (discrete mathematics);human height;maximal set;polynomial;procedural generation;recurrence relation;time complexity;tree (data structure);tree structure	Antoine Genitrini;Bernhard Gittenberger;Manuel Kauers;Michael Wallner	2017	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;geometry	Theory	35.661214304568546	26.52619629840263	150496

They are collections of bipartitions of a finite set X of taxa (e.g. species) with the property that, for every four taxa, at least one of the three bipartitions into two pairs (quartets) is not induced by any of the X-splits.We characterize all split systemswhere exactly two quartets from every quadruple are induced by some split. On the other hand, we construct maximal weakly compatible split systems where the number of induced quartets per quadruple tends to 0 with the number of taxa going to infinity. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

e97229b1858e0d3c15e8b341c5a77f250d6e1812	uniform s-cross-intersecting families		In this paper we study a question related to the classical Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem, which states that any family of k-element subsets of the set [n] = {1, . . . , n} in which any two sets intersect, has cardinality at most (︀ n−1 k−1 )︀ . We say that two non-empty families are A,B ⊂ (︀[n] k )︀ are s-cross-intersecting, if for any A ∈ A, B ∈ B we have |A ∩ B| ≥ s. In this paper we determine the maximum of |A|+ |B| for all n. This generalizes a result of Hilton and Milner, who determined the maximum of |A|+ |B| for nonempty 1-cross-intersecting families.

2daae6ddb90e5b76fdc1584f403d5d1a0fc3b48a	properties determined by the ihara zeta function of a graph	spectrum;zeta function;regular graph	In this paper, we show how to determine several properties of a finite graph G from its Ihara zeta function ZG(u). If G is connected and has minimal degree at least 2, we show how to calculate the number of vertices of G. To do so we use a result of Bass, and in the case that G is nonbipartite, we give an elementary proof of Bass’ result. We further show how to determine whether G is regular, and if so, its regularity and spectrum. On the other hand, we extend work of Czarneski to give several infinite families of pairs of non-isomorphic non-regular graphs with the same Ihara zeta function. These examples demonstrate that several properties of graphs, including vertex and component numbers, are not determined by the Ihara zeta function. We end with Hashimoto’s edge matrix T. We show that any graph G with no isolated vertices can be recovered from its T matrix. Since graphs with the same Ihara zeta function are exactly those with isospectral T matrices, this relates again to the question of what information about G can be recovered from its Ihara zeta function.	graph (discrete mathematics);ihara zeta function	Yaim Cooper	2009	Electr.

Its vertex set is the unit group of a finite extension of a finite local ring R and its adjacency condition is that the quotient is a monic primary polynomial. We investigate its connectedness and diameter bound, and we also show that our graph is an expander graph. In addition, if a local ring has nilpotency two, then we obtain a better view of our graph from the lifting of the graph over its residue field.	magma	Arnisa Rasri;Yotsanan Meemark	2017	Finite Fields and Their Applications	10.1016/j.ffa.2017.08.002	combinatorics;vertex-transitive graph;universal graph;mathematics;algebra;forbidden graph characterization;coxeter graph;butterfly graph;voltage graph;topology;regular graph;cayley graph	Theory	32.87770962907599	32.27058073385874	155237

We observe that, without loss of generality, every such domain can be assumed to be closed in the sense that it contains the majority relation of every profile with an odd number of voters whose preferences belong to this domain. We show that every closed Condorcet domain can be endowed with the structure of a median graph and that, conversely, every median graph is associated with a closed Condorcet domain (in general, not uniquely). Condorcet domains that have linear graphs (chains) associated with them are exactly the preference domains with the classical singlecrossing property. As a corollary, we obtain that a domain with the so-called ‘representative voter property’ is either a single-crossing domain or a very special domains containing exactly four different preference orders whose associated median graph is a 4-cycle. Maximality of a Condorcet domain imposes additional restrictions on the associated median graph. We prove that among all trees only (some) chains can be associated graphs of maximal Condorcet domains, and we characterize those single-crossing domains which are maximal Condorcet domains. Finally, using the characterization of Nehring and Puppe [2007] of monotone Arrovian aggregation, our analysis yields a rich class of strategy-proof social choice functions on any closed Condorcet domain.

Except for P""""8 , they were all known to be excluded minors for GF(4)-representability (see Oxley [15, 17]). The matroid P""""8 is obtained by relaxing the unique pair of disjoint circuit-hyperplanes of P8 . Ever since Whitney's introductory paper [28] on matroid theory, researchers have sought ways to distinguish the representable matroids. For any field F, the class of F-representable matroids is closed under taking minors. Thus, it is natural to characterize the minor-minimal matroids that are not F-representable; we refer to such matroids as excluded minors.

A weak metacirculant is a graph admitting a transitive metacyclic group that is a group generated by two automorphisms ρ and σ , where ρ is (m, n)-semiregular for some integers m ≥ 1 and n ≥ 2, and where σ normalizes ρ. It was shown in [D. Marušič, P. Šparl, On quartic half-arc-transitive metacirculants, J. Algebr. Comb. 28 (2008) 365–395] that each connected quartic half-arc-transitive weak metacirculant X belongs to one (or possibly more) of four classes of such graphs, reflecting the structure of the quotient graph Xρ relative to the semiregular automorphismρ. The first of these classes, called Class I, coincideswith the class of so-called tightly attached graphs. Class II consists of the quartic half-arc-transitive weak metacirculants for which the quotient graph Xρ is a cycle with a loop at each vertex. Class III consists of those graphs forwhich each vertex of the quotient graphXρ is connected to three other vertices, to one with a double edge. Finally, Class IV consists of those graphs for which Xρ is a simple quartic graph. This paper consists of two results concerning graphs of Class II. It is shown that, with the exception of theDoyle–Holt graph and its canonical double cover, each quartic half-arctransitive weak metacirculant of Class II is also of Class IV. It is also shown that although quartic half-arc-transitive weak metacirculants of Class II which are not tightly attached exist they are ‘‘almost tightly attached’’. More precisely, their radius is at most four times their attachment number. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 1. Introductory remarks Throughout this paper graphs are assumed to be finite and, unless stated otherwise, simple, connected and undirected (but with an implicit orientation of the edges when appropriate). For groupand graph-theoretic concepts not defined here we refer the reader to [4,18], and [7], respectively. Given a graph X , we let V (X), E(X), A(X) and AutX be the vertex set, the edge set, the arc set and the automorphism group of X , respectively. A graph X is said to be vertex-transitive, edge-transitive and arc-transitive if its automorphism group AutX acts transitively on V (X), E(X) and A(X), respectively. We say that X is half-arc-transitive if it is vertexand edge-transitive but not arc-transitive. The study of half-arc-transitive graphs, which was initiated more than forty years ago by Tutte [17], has received a lot of attention over the past two decades and is still a very active topic of research. Half-arc-transitive graphs have been considered from various different aspects and many interesting results have been obtained thus far (the interested reader ∗ Corresponding address: University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Education, Kardeljeva ploščad 16, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.

Šparl / Discrete Mathematics 310 (2010) 1737–1742 is referred to [6,9,11,12,15] and the references therein). However, despite all the efforts there are still numerous questions about these graphs that need to be answered. Indeed, even the family of quartic half-arc-transitive graphs,whichwas studied themost, seems to be too rich to be completely classified. We are thus forced to restrict ourselves to some of its subfamilies. One of the possible directions to take was proposed in [12] where the investigation of quartic half-arc-transitive weak metacirculants was initiated. (A weak metacirculant is a graph admitting a transitive metacyclic group 〈ρ, σ 〉 where ρ is a semiregular automorphism normalized by σ .) It was shown that every quartic half-arc-transitive weak metacirculant belongs to one (or possibly more) of four classes of such graphs, reflecting the structure of the quotient graph relative to the semiregular automorphism ρ. (The four classes are described in Section 2.) In [12] two of these classes (Class I and Class II) were thoroughly investigated. In particular, it was shown that Class I coincides with the class of so-called tightly attached graphs, which have already been completely classified [10,14]. (Quartic tightly attached graphs were introduced in [10] as quartic half-arc-transitive graphs in which two nondisjoint alternating cycles meet in precisely half of their vertices; see Section 2 for a precise definition.) The investigation of quartic half-arc-transitive weakmetacirculants was continued in [15] where Class II was completely classified. Nevertheless, the question of how the four classes of quartic half-arc-transitive weak metacirculants relate to each other has not received much attention until now. It is this question that this paper is concerned with. In particular we focus on Class II and its connection to Classes I and IV. The following are the main results of this paper. Theorem 1.1. Let X be a connected quartic half-arc-transitive weak metacirculant of Class II. If X is not tightly attached then either R = 2A or R = 4A holds, whereR andA are the radius and the attachment number of X, respectively. Moreover, letting X ∼= Y(m, n; r, t), where the parametersm, n, r and t satisfy the conditions of Proposition2.1 and letting α = m+ 2 (r−1), we have that (i) X is tightly attached if and only if r − 1 ∈ 〈t − α〉, (ii) R = 2A if and only if 2(r − 1) ∈ 〈t − α〉 but r − 1 6∈ 〈t − α〉 and (iii) R = 4A if and only if 2(r − 1) 6∈ 〈t − α〉. Theorem 1.2. Let X be a connected quartic half-arc-transitive weak metacirculant of Class II. Then X is also of Class IV if and only if it is not isomorphic to the Doyle–Holt graph Y(3, 9; 4, 6) or its canonical double cover Y(3, 18; 7, 15). The graphs Y(m, n; r, t) are defined in the following section. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 notation is fixed, some results from the literature that will be needed in the subsequent sections are stated, and the four classes of quartic half-arc-transitive weak metacirculants and the graphs Y(m, n; r, t) are introduced. Then Sections 3 and 4 are devoted to the proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2, respectively.	attachments;discrete mathematics;graph (discrete mathematics);graph automorphism;graph theory;isogonal figure;isotoxal figure;quotient graph;symmetric graph;transitive closure;vertex-transitive graph	Primoz Sparl	2010	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2009.11.015	integer;vertex;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;quartic function;automorphism;topology;connectivity;cycle graph;vertex;symmetric graph;mathematics;quotient;quartic graph;algebra	Theory	33.54113234080272	29.62214571190975	155724
cf9aa122e613b98cbf5d168a86baa86f40510867	tight bounds for consensus systems convergence		We analyze the asymptotic convergence of all infinite products of matrices taken in a given finite set, by looking only at finite or periodic products. It is known that when the matrices of the set have a common nonincreasing polyhedral norm, all infinite products converge to zero if and only if all infinite periodic products with period smaller than a certain value converge to zero, and bounds exist on that value [15]. We provide a stronger bound holding for both polyhedral norms and polyhedral seminorms. In the latter case, the matrix products do not necessarily converge to 0, but all trajectories of the associated system converge to a common invariant space. We prove our bound to be tight, in the sense that for any polyhedral seminorm, there is a set of matrices such that not all infinite products converge, but every periodic product with period smaller than our bound does converge. Our work is motivated by problems in consensus systems, where the matrices are stochastic (non-negative with rows summing to one), and hence always share a same common nonincreasing polyhedral seminorm. In this particular case, we show that for the dimension of the space n ≥ 8, our new bound is smaller than the previously known bound by a multiplicative factor of 3 2 √ πn . Our technique is based on an analysis of the combinatorial structure of the face lattice of the unit ball of the nonincreasing seminorm. The bound we obtain is equal to half the size of the largest antichain in this lattice. Explicitly evaluating this quantity may be challenging in some cases. We therefore link our problem with the Sperner property: the property that, for some graded posets, – in this case the face lattice of the unit ball of the norm – the size of the largest antichain is equal to the size of the largest rank level. We show that this property holds for the polytope obtained when treating sets of stochastic matrices, and that our bound can then be easily evaluated in that case which motivated our study. However, we show that some other sets of matrices with invariant polyhedral seminorms lead to posets that do not have that Sperner property. ∗All authors are members of ICTEAM, Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium.

It is shown that star height is preserved under such operations as taking quotients, addition or subtraction of a finite event, removal of all words beginning with a given letter, and removal of certain subsets of smaller star height. Next it is shown that there exist events of arbitrarily large star height whose union, concatenation, and star is of star height one. Also, arbitrarily large increases in star height can be obtained by using the intersection or complement operations. In the second part of the paper a technique for establishing the star height of regular events is developed. It is shown that for every regular event R of star height n there exists a nondeterministic state graph G whose states correspond to subsets of the set of states ~) of the reduced automaton accepting R and whose cycle rank is precisely n. Unfortunately a given subset ~)' of Q may have to be repeated k times in G and no bound on k is known. Thus it is still not known whether an algorithm for determining star height exists. However, it is felt that the techniques presented here provide new insight into the problem.		Rina S. Cohen;Janusz A. Brzozowski	1970	J. Comput. Syst.

It is clear that the rational-restricted psd rank is always an upper bound to the usual psd rank.

Given a p × q nonnegative matrix M , the positive semidefinite (psd) rank of M , denoted rankpsd M , is the smallest integer k such that there exist k×k real symmetric positive semidefinitematrices A1, . . . , Ap and B1, . . . , Bq such that Mij = ⟨Ai, Bj⟩ for i = 1, . . . , p and j = 1, . . . , q. Any such collection of matrices Ai and Bj is called a psd factorization of M . The notion of psd rank was introduced in [4] (see also [3]) and has many appealing geometric interpretations, including semidefinite representations of polyhedra and information-theoretic applications. We refer to [2] for a survey on this notion and a review of recent literature on it. In this note, we answer a basic structural question about the psd rank: if a nonnegative matrix M has only rational entries, can the psd rank of M always be achieved by a factorization using only rational matrices? We answer this question negatively by providing an example of a rational matrix with psd rank four such that every psd factorization of size four uses irrational numbers. Note that the analogous question for the nonnegative rank of a matrix was posed by Cohen and Rothblum in [1]. It was shown in [1] that all rational matrices with nonnegative rank two admit a rational nonnegative factorization, but the question for general nonnegative matrices remains open. The recent paper [7] however shows that there is a subfield F of R and a matrix A with entries from F such that the nonnegative rank of A over F is strictly greater than the nonnegative rank of A over R. ∗ Corresponding author.

The proof of our example will require a lemma about rational psd matrices of rank one. Any rank one symmetric psd matrix has the form vvT for some vector v. Then we have the following. Lemma 1. If the matrix vvT is composed of only rational entries, then v has the form αq where α is a real scalar and q is a rational vector. Proof. Suppose that v is a nonzero vector (else the conclusion is immediate). Then, without loss of generality, we may assume that the first coordinate v1 is nonzero. Since v2 1 is an entry in the matrix vvT , it must be rational. Hence, the matrix 1 v2 1 vvT is also rational. By looking at the first row of this matrix, we see that the vector  1, v2 v1 , v3 v1 , . . . , vr v1  is rational. Now we just scale this rational vector by v1 to finish the proof. Our candidate matrix M is the 8 × 6 matrix shown in Fig. 1. Readers who are familiar with slack matrices may be interested to know that M arises as a slack matrix of the polytope with vertices (0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (1, 2, 0), (0, 0, 1), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1), and (1, 2, 1). Readers who are not familiar with slack matrices need not worry, as we will refrain from using any results about slack matrices in the proofs. During our analysis of this example, we will require a few results about psd rank found in the literature. A matrix S is called an entry-wise square root of A ∈ R + if S2 ij = Aij for all i = 1, . . . , p and j = 1, . . . , q. We summarize these results in the following proposition. Proposition 2. 1. [4, Prop. 5] If S is an entry-wise square root of A, then rankpsd A ≤ rank S. 60 H. Fawzi et al. / Operations Research Letters 44 (2016) 59–60 Fig. 1. Our example matrix is a slack matrix of a three dimensional polytope. 2. [6, Cor. 4.8], [5, Prop. 2.6] If A contains a k×k triangular submatrix T , then rankpsd A ≥ k. Furthermore, in a psd factorization of A of size k, the factor corresponding to the row (or column) of T with k − 1 zeros must have rank one. Now we begin our analysis of the matrixM . Lemma 3. We have that rankpsd M = 4 and any psd factorization of M of size four uses only rank one factors. Proof. One can verify that the entry-wise square root ofM with all entries nonnegative has usual rank four. Thus Proposition 2 says that rankpsd M ≤ 4. Consider the submatrix of M indexed by rows 1, 5, 7, and 8 and columns 1, 2, 5, and 6. This submatrix is triangular so Proposition 2 tells us two things: First, we have that rankpsd M ≥ 4 and, hence, rankpsd M = 4. Second, the factors corresponding to the first row and first column in a psd factorization ofM of size four must always be rank one. It is easy to verify by inspection that for every rowand columnofM wecan find a 4×4 triangular submatrix such that the row or column in question has three zeros in that submatrix. Thus, repeatedly applying the proposition completes the proof. Remark 4. Note that Lemma 3 is actually a consequence of [5, Prop. 3.2] since our polytope has minimal psd rank (equal to the ambient dimension plus one) and thus any psd factorization must consist entirely of rank-one factors. The next proposition shows that no rational psd factorization of M can have size four. Proposition 5. We have that rankpsd M = 4, but there does not exist a psd factorization of size four using only rational matrices. Proof. Suppose, by way of contradiction, that (A1, . . . , A8, B1, . . . , B6) is a psd factorization ofM of size four that uses only rational matrices. By Lemma 3, each matrix must be rank one. Thus, there exist vectors a1, . . . , a8 and b1, . . . , b6 such that Ai = aiai and Bj = bjbj . Furthermore, by the properties of the trace,wemust have that Mij = ⟨Ai, Bj⟩ = ⟨ai, bj⟩. Thus, the matrix whose (i, j)th entry is given by ⟨ai, bj⟩ is an entry-wise square root of M , which we denote by S. By looking at the submatrix of S corresponding to the first two rows and the fourth and sixth columns, we see that S contains a submatrixS of the form  ±1 ±1	column (database);existential quantification;information theory;low-rank approximation;operations research;polyhedron;semidefinite programming;sixthsense;slack variable;social inequality;the matrix;xfig	Hamza Fawzi;João Gouveia;Richard Z.

More precisely, the invariant which we shall describe is the restriction to plane graphs of a certain invariant of oriented bipartite cubic graphs embedded in 3-space, which corresponds in the case of links to a one-variable specialization of the ‘homfly’ polynomial [2]. It will not be possible to give here an account of these topological aspects, and we have chosen to propose a self-contained exposition of the plane case. We hope to convince the reader that this plane case is of interest in itself by exhibiting relationships with two well studied invariants of plane cubic graphs, the number of edge-3-colorings and the flow polynomial evaluated at A = t + 1, where r denotes the golden ratio. We also hope to contribute to a better understanding of a method for constructing invariants due to Yetter [16] by giving a detailed proof of the existence of our invariant which illustrates this method.	cubic function	François Jaeger	1992	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/0012-365X(92)90599-B	complete bipartite graph;plane curve;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;cubic form;topology;bipartite graph;invariant;cubic graph;mathematics;geometry	Theory	34.2320538249497	25.81863850907026	159897

This concept is used in the algorithmic, combinatorial approach to knowledge discovery and data mining. We consider the complexity aspects of frequent sets. An explicit family of subsets is given that requires exponentially many rows to be represented as the family of frequent sets of a matrix, with any threshold. Examples are given of families that can be represented by a small matrix with threshold t, but that require a significantly larger matrix if the threshold is less than t. We also discuss the connections of these problems to circuit complexity and the existence of efficient listing algorithms.	algorithm;circuit complexity;column (database);data mining	Robert H.

In case α is computable from n and Cx ≥ α + 12 log n, the size of the same set is at least 1/C2n-α-polyn2α, for some positive constant C. • There exists a set of n-bit strings A of size polyn2α such that any n-bit string has α-dependency with some string in A. • If the set of n-bit strings {x1,..., xt} is pairwise α-independent, then t ≤ polyn2α.

dc191d21d7d169caf04e8662cca8bf5af5006e3f	large cardinals and lightface definable well-orders, without the gch		This paper deals with the question whether the assumption that for every inaccessible cardinal κ there is a well-order of H(κ+) definable over the structure 〈H(κ+),∈〉 by a formula without parameters is consistent with the existence of (large) large cardinals and failures of the GCH. We work under the assumption that the SCH holds at every singular fixed point of the i-function and construct a class forcing that adds such a well-order at every inaccessible cardinal and preserves ZFC, all cofinalities, the continuum function and all supercompact cardinals. Even in the absence of a proper class of inaccessible cardinals, this forcing produces a model of “V = HOD” and can therefore be used to force this axiom while preserving large cardinals and failures of the GCH. As another application, we show that we can start with a model containing an ω-superstrong cardinal κ and use this forcing to build a model in which κ is still ω-superstrong, the GCH fails at κ and there is a well-order of H(κ+) that is definable over H(κ+) without parameters. Finally, we can apply the forcing to answer a question about the definable failure of the GCH at a measurable cardinal.	fixed point (mathematics);system controller hub;triune continuum paradigm;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Sy-David Friedman;Peter Holy;Philipp Lücke	2015	J.

Assume M is internally 4-connected and that neither M nor its dual is a cubic Möbius or planar ladder or a certain coextension thereof. Let N be an internally 4-connected proper minor of M . Our aim is to show that M has a proper internally 4-connected minor with an N -minor that can be obtained from M either by removing at most four elements, or by removing elements in an easily described way from a special substructure of M . When this aim cannot be met, the earlier papers in this series showed that, up to duality, M has a good bowtie, that is, a pair, {x1, x2, x3} and {x4, x5, x6}, of disjoint triangles and a cocircuit, {x2, x3, x4, x5}, where M\x3 has an N minor and is (4, 4, S)-connected. We also showed that, when M has a good bowtie, either M\x3, x6 has an N -minor; or M\x3/x2 has an N -minor and is (4, 4, S)-connected. In this paper, we show that, when M\x3, x6 has an N minor but is not (4, 4, S)-connected, M has an internally 4-connected proper minor with an N -minor that can be obtained from M by removing at most three elements, or by removing elements in a well-described way from one of several special substructures of M . This is a significant step towards obtaining a splitter theorem for the class of internally 4-connected binary matroids.	binary matroid;bowtie (sequence analysis);connectivity (graph theory);cubic function;lumpers and splitters	Carolyn Chun;Dillon Mayhew;James G.

The main results below include a proof that any high total e-degree below 0e is splittable over any low e-degree below it, and a construction of a Π 1 e-degree unsplittable over a ∆2 e-degree below it. In [ACK] it was shown that using semirecursive sets one can construct minimal pairs of e-degrees by both effective and uniform ways, following which new results concerning the local distribution of total e-degrees and of the degrees of semirecursive sets enabled one to proceed, via the natural embedding of the Turing degrees in the enumeration degrees, to results concerning embeddings of the diamond lattice in the e-degrees. A particularly striking application of these techniques was a relatively simple derivation of a strong generalisation of the Ahmad Diamond Theorem. This paper extends the known constraints on further progress in this direction, such as the result of Ahmad and Lachlan [AL98] showing the existence of a nonsplitting ∆2 e-degree > 0e, and the recent result of Soskova [Sos07] showing that 0e is unsplittable in the Σ 0 2 e-degrees above some Σ 0 2 e-degree < 0 ′ e. This work also relates to results (e.g. Cooper and Copestake [CC88]) limiting the local distribution of total e-degrees. For further background concerning enumeration reducibility and its degree structure, the reader is referred to Cooper [Co90], Sorbi [Sor97] or Cooper [Co04], chapter 11.	acknowledgement (data networks);semi-membership;turing degree	Marat M.

A downset D is defined analogously. In 1966, Kleitman ( J. Combin. Theory 1 (1966), 153–155) proved that if U and D are arbitrary up- and downsets, respectively, then | U | | D | ⩾ 2 |S| | U ∩ D |. In this note, we show that a necessary and sufficient condition for equality to hold is: for every minimal element U of U and every maximal element D of D , U ⊆ D . This result is extended to some related inequalities.		Daniel McQuillan;R. Bruce Richter	1994	J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

Further, it is shown that structures with local maps which have this property are in the minority. In particular, for a fixed template T , the fraction of local maps with minimal decompositions approaches O as m , the number of states, increases arbitrarily.		Jon T. Butler	1979	J. Comput. Syst.

That means all triangulations of euclidean acyclic oriented matroids are PL-homeomorphic to PL-balls and that all triangulations of totally cyclic oriented matroids are PL-homeomorphic to PLspheres. For non-euclidean oriented matroids this question is wide open. One key point in the proof of Anderson is the following fact: for every triangulation of a euclidean oriented matroid the adjacency graph of the set of all simplices “intersecting” a segment [p-p+] is a path. We call this graph the [p-p+]adjacency graph of the triangulation. While we cannot solve the problem of the topological type of triangulations of general oriented matroids we show in this note that for every circuit admissible triangulation of an arbitrary oriented matroid the [p-p+]-adjacency graph is path. Triangulations of oriented matroids appeared in the literature as natural combinatorial models for triangulations of point configurations [2]. However, since not all oriented matroids model point configurations the notion of a triangulation of an oriented matroid gives rise to additional questions that do not come up in the theory of triangulations of point configurations. One of these questions is the following: is the abstract simplicial complex defined by a triangulation of an oriented matroid homeomorphic ot a sphere in the totally acyclic case or a ball in the acyclic case? The answer to this question in the realizable case is of course affirmative because in the case of point configurations the triangulation is naturally embedded as a convex set in a euclidean space. Why care about the general case? An application of triangulations of oriented matroids in their full generality is their appearance in the theory of combinatorial differential manifolds. “Good” topological properties in this context lead to the existence of differentiable strucures on these objects, making the combinatorial model more suitable [1, 4]. But also as an investigation of what weird things might happen in the theory of non-realizable oriented matroids this question has become a challenging open problem in its own right. (An in-depth study of triangulations of oriented matroids is presented in [5], background on oriented matroids can be found in [3].) For a euclidean oriented matroid Anderson has proved that the topological types of all its triangulations are the same. Since for all oriented matroids there are triangulations known that are homeomorphic to a sphere resp. to a ball—the socalled lifting triangulations—the answer to the above question is affirmative. One important building block in the construction of Anderson is the fact that the adjacency graph of the set of simplices in a triangulation “intersecting” an arbitrary segment is always a path. (For exact definitions see below.) In this note we show that this graph is also a path for general oriented matroids provided the triangulation respects an additional property: it does not contain a so-called intersection circuit, a circuit that has positive in one simplex and negative part in another simplex in the triangulation. We start by defining our main object of study. For simplicity, we call r-subsets of full rank r simplices; subsets of rank r − 1 are called facets.	ball project;convex set;directed acyclic graph;embedded system;lambda lifting;lifting scheme;matroid;simplicial complex;strong orientation;triangulation (geometry)	Jörg Rambau	2002	Discrete & Computational Geometry	10.1007/s00454-001-0058-3	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;graphic matroid;topology;oriented matroid;mathematics;matroid partitioning	Theory	35.42223956411597	25.495950985366548	165872

There exists a theorem which characterizes Delaunay graphs and yields a polynomial time algorithm for the problem only by solving a certain linear inequality system. The theorem was proved by Rivin based on arguments of hyperbolic geometry. Independently, Hiroshima, Miyamoto and Sugihara gave another proof of the theorem based on primitive arguments on Euclidean geometry. Unfortunately, the existing proofs of the theorem are rather difficult or long. In this paper, we give a simple proof of the theorem characterizing Delaunay graphs, which is based on the fixed point theorem.	algorithm;delaunay triangulation;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point theorem;george sugihara;linear inequality;p (complexity);planar graph;social inequality	Tomomi Matsui;Yuichiro Miyamoto	2012			fáry's theorem;mirsky's theorem;closed graph theorem;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;brouwer fixed-point theorem;topology;factor theorem;delaunay triangulation;danskin's theorem;no-go theorem;perfect graph;proofs of fermat's little theorem;fundamental theorem;mathematics;geometry;bruck–ryser–chowla theorem;picard–lindelöf theorem;fixed-point theorem;dilworth's theorem;bowyer–watson algorithm	Theory	34.48994257924289	25.537468102014312	165954

A geometric permutation</i> of <i>S</i> is the pair of orders in which members of <i>S</i> are met by a line transversal, one order being the reverse of the other.In this note we consider a long-standing open problem in transversal theory, namely that of determining the largest number of geometric permutations that a family of <i>n</i> pairwise disjoint convex objects in R<sup><i>d</i></sup> can admit. We settle a restricted variant of this problem. Specifically, we show that the maximum number of those geometric permutations to a family of <i>n</i> > 2 pairwise disjoint convex objects that are induced by lines passing through any fixed point is between <i>K</i>(<i>n</i> - 1, <i>d</i> - 1) and <i>K</i>(<i>n,d</i> - 1), where <i>K</i>(<i>n,d</i>) = Σ<sup>d</sup><inf>i=0</inf> (<i>n</i>-1/<i>i</i>) = Θ(<i>n</i><sup><i>d</i></sup>) is the number of pairs of antipodal cells in a simple arrangement of <i>n</i> great (<i>d</i> - 1)-spheres in a <i>d</i>-sphere. By a similar argument, we show that the maximum number of connected components of the space of all lines transversal through a fixed point to a family of <i>n</i> > 2 possibly intersecting convex objects is <i>K</i>(<i>n, d</i> - 1). Finally, we refute a conjecture of Sharir and Smorodinsky on the number of neighbor pairs in geometric permutations and offer an alternative conjecture which may be a first step towards solving the aforementioned general problem of bounding the number of geometric permutations.	connected component (graph theory);fixed point (mathematics)	Boris Aronov;Shakhar Smorodinsky	2005			mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;connected component;mathematics;geometry;fixed point	Theory	35.32705440980283	25.430592398576525	166373

The proof made use of Tarski’s theorem about the decidability of first order sentences over the reals in an essential way and thus was not immediately applicable to a specific finite complex. In this article we describe an algorithm restricted to 3-dimensional complexes which uses only elementary 3-dimensional geometry. After describing the procedure we include several examples involving Euclidean tetrahedra which were run using an implementation of the algorithm in GAP. In this article we describe an algorithm to determine whether or not a finite 3-dimensional Mκ-complex is locally CAT(κ). The procedure is based purely on elementary 3-dimensional geometry, and has considerable computational advantages over the algorithm for Mκ-complexes of arbitrary dimension which was described by the authors in [6]. After describing the procedure we include several examples involving Euclidean tetrahedra which were run using an implementation of the algorithm in GAP. The implementation is available from the authors upon request. The article is structured as follows: Section 1 contains a brief review of polyhedral and comparison geometry which is included for completeness, but can easily by skipped by readers familar with the area. In Section 2 we review the notion of a gallery as introduced in [6]. A gallery in our sense is a generalization of the notion of gallery used in the study of Coxeter complexes. Sections 3 through 6 contain the core of the argument. In these sections we describe how to detect a closed geodesic of length less than 2π in each of the four types of circular galleries which can occur in dimension 3: annular, Möbius, disc and necklace. In Section 7 we describe a technique for enumerating the precise finite list of circular galleries which can be built from a specified list of building blocks and contain a closed geodesic of length less than 2π. We then show in Section 8 how to apply this list of forbidden galleries to test whether a particular finite complex is locally CAT(κ). Supported under NSF grant no.

This is regarded as a generalization of the well-known and much-solved problem of dissecting such figures into unequal squares. There is an analogous ``electrical'' theory but it is based on digraphs instead of graphs and has an appropriate modification of Kirchhoff's first law.

In 1990's M. Zheng constructed the 3-resonant benzenoid systems and showed that they are maximally resonant, that is, they are k-resonant for all k>=1. Recently, the equivalence of 3-resonance and maximal resonance has been shown to be valid also for coronoid systems, carbon nanotubes, polyhexes in tori and Klein bottles, and fullerene graphs. So our main problem is to investigate the extent of graphs possessing this interesting property. In this paper, by replacing the above hexagons with even faces, we define k-resonance of graphs in surfaces, possibly with boundary, in a unified way. Some exceptions exist. For plane polygonal systems tessellated with polygons of even size at least six such that all inner vertices have the same degree three and the others have degree two or three, we show that such 3-resonant polygonal systems are indeed maximally resonant. They can be constructed by gluing and lapping operations on three types of basic graphs.

db06a010c416e66bef3db7bc96e946624b00a19e	characterization and construction of a family of highly symmetric spherical polyhedra with application in modeling self-assembling structures		The regular polyhedra have the highest order of 3D symmetries and are exceptionally attractive templates for (self)-assembly using minimal types of building blocks, from nano-cages and virus capsids to large scale constructions like glass domes. However, they only represent a small number of possible spherical layouts which can serve as templates for symmetric assembly. In this paper, we formalize the necessary and sufficient conditions for symmetric assembly using exactly one type of building block. All such assemblies correspond to spherical polyhedra which are edge-transitive and face-transitive, but not necessarily vertex-transitive. This describes a new class of polyhedra outside of the well-studied Platonic, Archimedean, Catalan and and Johnson solids. We show that this new family, dubbed almost-regular polyhedra, can be parameterized using only two variables and provide an efficient algorithm to generate an infinite series of such polyhedra. Additionally, considering the almost-regular polyhedra as templates for the assembly of 3D spherical shell structures, we developed an efficient polynomial time shell assembly approximation algorithm for an otherwise NP-hard geometric optimization problem.	approximation algorithm;catalan solid;computation;debian;dodecahedron;gnu nano;hexahedron;isogonal figure;isohedral figure;isotoxal figure;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;polynomial;spherical polyhedron;steinhaus–johnson–trotter algorithm;tetrakis(dimethylamino)titanium;tiling window manager;time complexity;unfolding (dsp implementation);vertex-transitive graph;whole earth 'lectronic link	Muhibur Rasheed;Chandrajit L.

The main question studied is, given an integer k, does there exist a colouring of given type using exactly k colours? For several types of colourings, a complete answer to this question is obtained while for other types, partial results are presented. We also discuss the question of the existence of uncolourable systems.	steiner tree problem	Salvatore Milici;Alexander Rosa;Vitaly I.

To prove the undecidability of the the Domino problem, Robert Berger constructed in 1966 the first aperiodic tile set [1]. His proof was simplified in 1971 by Rafael Robinson, who introduced a six-tile set and proved its aperiodicity.

Since C is obviously (n − d − 1)-regular, the set of all integers k for which C is k-regular is nonempty. The minimum δ(C) of this set deserves attention because of its link with flip-graph connectivity. This paper introduces a characterization of δ(C) derived from the theory of Gale transforms. Using this characterization, it is proven that δ(C) is never greater than n−d−2. Several new results on flip-graph connectivity follow. In particular, it is shown that connectedness does not always hold for the subgraph induced by 3-regular triangulations in the flip-graph of a point configuration. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The elements of Γ are colours. If |Γ| = m, we have an m-colouring of (V,B). For every B ∈ B, let φ(B) = {φ(x)|x ∈ B}. There are seven distinct colouring patterns in which a 4-cycle can be coloured: type a (××××, monochromatic), type b (×××2, two-coloured of pattern 3 + 1), type c (× × 22, two-coloured of pattern 2 + 2), type d (×2 × 2, mixed two-coloured), type e (× × 24, three-coloured of pattern 2 + 1 + 1), type f (×2 ×4, mixed three-coloured), type g (×24♦, four-coloured or polychromatic). Let S be a subset of {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}. An m-colouring φ of (V,B) is said of type S if the type of every 4-cycle of B is in S. A type S colouring is said to be proper if for every type α ∈ S there is at least one 4-cycle of B having colour type α. We say that a P (v, 3, 1), (W,P), is embedded in a 4-cycle system of order n, (V,B), if every path p = [a1, a2, a3] ∈ P occurs in a 4-cycle (a1, a2, a3, x) ∈ B such that x 6∈ W . In this paper we consider the following spectrum problem: given an integer m and a set S ⊆ {b, d, f}, determine the set of integers n such that there exists a 4cycle system of order n with a proper m-colouring of type S (note that each colour class of a such colouration is the point set of a P3-design embedded in the 4-cycle system). We give a complete answer to the above problem except when S = {b}. In this case the problem is completely solved only for m = 2.

93d8138ea7bfb3d44e9f787c5f1cf92d24631191	strongly representable atom structures of cylindric algebras		A cylindric algebra atom structure is said to be strongly representable if all atomic cylindric algebras with that atom structure are representable. This is equivalent to saying that the full complex algebra of the atom structure is a representable cylindric algebra. We show that for any finite n ≥ 3, the class of all strongly representable n-dimensional cylindric algebra atom structures is not closed under ultraproducts and is therefore not elementary. Our proof is based on the following construction. From an arbitrary undirected, loopfree graph Γ, we construct an n-dimensional atom structure E(Γ), and prove, for infinite Γ, that E(Γ) is a strongly representable cylindric algebra atom structure if and only if the chromatic number of Γ is infinite. A construction of Erdős shows that there are graphs Γk (k < ω) with infinite chromatic number, but having a non-principal ultraproduct ∏ D Γk whose chromatic number is just two. It follows that E(Γk) is strongly representable (each k < ω) but ∏ D E(Γk) is not.	atom;axiomatic system;cylindric numbering;erdős number;first-order predicate;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;mv-algebra;surround sound;turing completeness	Robin Hirsch;Ian M.

dad23b752bdea8bbf1790dbf1a7c3e1b1f64251e	the multicolour ramsey number of a long odd cycle		For a graph G, the k-colour Ramsey number Rk(G) is the least integer N such that every k-colouring of the edges of the complete graph KN contains a monochromatic copy of G. Bondy and Erdős conjectured that for an odd cycle Cn on n > 3 vertices, Rk(Cn) = 2 k−1(n− 1) + 1. This is known to hold when k = 2 and n > 3, and when k = 3 and n is large. We show that this conjecture holds asymptotically for k ≥ 4, proving that for n odd, Rk(Cn) = 2 k−1n+ o(n) as n→∞. The proof uses the regularity lemma to relate this problem in Ramsey theory to one in convex optimisation, allowing analytic methods to be exploited. Our analysis leads us to a new class of lower bound constructions for this problem, which naturally arise from perfect matchings in the k-dimensional hypercube. Progress towards a resolution of the conjecture for large n is also discussed.	carrier-to-noise ratio;convex optimization;erdős number;graph coloring;mathematical optimization;monochrome;ramsey's theorem;szemerédi regularity lemma	Matthew Jenssen	2015	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2015.06.053	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	31.945016790230827	27.935081858467115	175265

It is an open problem to determine those connected skew shapes that are maximal with respect to this ordering. A strong necessary condition for the Schur-positivity of sA−sB is that the support of B is contained in that of A, where the support of B is defined to be the set of partitions λ for which sλ appears in the Schur expansion of sB . We show that to determine the maximal connected skew shapes in the Schur-positivity order and this support containment order, it suffices to consider a special class of ribbon shapes. We explicitly determine the support for these ribbon shapes, thereby determining the maximal connected skew shapes in the support containment order.	maximal set	Peter R. W.

The same conclusion holds if the condition ‘is chordal’ is replaced by ‘contains no induced C4 (or Kk,k for k finite)’. In [9] Wagon asked if the following holds. If X is a chordal graph with Kω 6≤ X then Chr(X) ≤ ω. This was proved by Halin in [5]. Here we improve this result. We show that if μ is an infinite cardinal, X is a chordal graph such that Kμ 6≤ X, then Chr(X) ≤ μ, in fact even the coloring number of X is at most μ. With a different argument we show the same result if only an induced C4 (or any induced Kk,k) is excluded. An example of Galvin’s shows that for every infinite cardinal μ there is an interval graph X containing no Kμ+ but Chr(X) = μ , that is, X is not perfect. Notation. Definitions. We use the notation and definitions of axiomatic set theory. In particular, ordinals are von Neumann ordinals, and each cardinal is identified with the least ordinal of that cardinality. For the notions of regular cardinals, closed unbounded and stationary sets, the reader can consult [4]. A graph is an arbitrary set of unordered pairs of some set V , the set of vertices. If v ∈ V , then N(v) is the set of neighbors of v, i.e., N(v) = {w : {v, w} ∈ X}. If κ is a cardinal, then Kκ is the complete graph on κ vertices. If a, b are cardinals, then Ka,b is the complete bipartite graph with bipartition classes of cardinality a, b, respectively. Cn denotes the circuit of length n. A graph is chordal if it does not contain an induced Cn for n ≥ 4.	carrier-to-noise ratio;clique (graph theory);definition;degeneracy (graph theory);graph coloring;ka band;ordinal data;set theory;stationary process;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Péter Komjáth	2015	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2015.03.022	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;interval graph;topology;mathematics;treewidth;chordal graph;indifference graph	Theory	32.07454016020183	28.083460215481168	176025

This new concept is closely related with the classical notion of embedding, which has been extensively studied, for many classes of graphs, by several authors; see, for example, the survey [28]. Actually, a sampling ξ might induce several embeddings of the design B′ into B, although the converse is not true in general. In the present paper we study in more detail the behaviour of samplings of Γ–complete designs of order n into Γ′–complete designs of the same order and show how the natural necessary condition for the existence of a regular sampling is actually sufficient. We also provide some explicit constructions of samplings, as well as propose further generalizations.	graph (discrete mathematics);induced subgraph;sampling (signal processing)	Luca Giuzzi;Anita Pasotti	2012	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2011.02.034	sampling;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;embedding;mathematics	Theory	36.96451435589262	27.65699373838075	176318

In AG(4, 3), maximal caps contain 20 points; the 81 points of AG(4, 3) can be partitioned into 4 mutually disjoint maximal caps together with a single point P , where every pair of points that makes a line with P lies entirely inside one of those caps. The caps in a partition can be paired up so that both pairs are either in exactly one partition or they are both in two different partitions. This difference determines the two equivalence classes of partitions of AG(4, 3) under the action by affine transformations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ba5295622a123879949e1b853d6a840822dc0538	eigenschaften kleinster dominierender mengen und dominanzzahlen von damengraphen	data processing computer science	We consider the problem of determining the size γ(Qn) of a minimum dominating set and the size i(Qn) of an independent minimum dominating set of the queens graph Qn. Every vertex v ∈ V (Qn) of the graph Qn corresponds to a square of the (n× n) chessboard and two squares are adjacent if and only if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal. We show that every p-cover of Qn, n ≥ 19, occupies both long diagonals that go through two corner squares and thus this condition in an alternative characterization of p-covers is nonrestrictive. We introduce a generalization of p-covers, namely orthodox covers, and show their relevance by stating some corresponding minimum dominating sets. For n ≡ 6 (mod 8), n ≥ 96, we show that there is no non-orthodox cover D of Qn of size #D = n2 . In conjunction with a necessary condition for the existence of an orthodox cover of size n2 , in many cases the lower bound is raised to γ(Qn) ≥ n 2 + 1, proving new domination numbers. Specifying appropriate dominating sets we show: γ(Qn) = n+1 2 for n = 43, 55, 83, 99, 107, 133, 137, 141, 143, 145, 149, 153, 157, 161, 163, 165, 169, 173, 177, 181, 183, 185, 189, 193, 197, 213, 221, and i(Qn) = n+1 2 for n = 117, 121, 129, 141, 145, 157, 161, 165, 177, 185, 189.

50dce76504c28bfbeaafde9278d0561a67dadd60	on the limitations of the use of solvable groups in cayley graph cage constructions	cayley graph;upper bound;solvable group;regular graph	A (k, g)-cage is a (connected) k-regular graph of girth g having smallest possible order. While many of the best known constructions of small k-regular graphs of girth g are known to be Cayley graphs, there appears to be no general theory of the relationship between the girth of a Cayley graph and the structure of the underlying group. We attempt to fill this gap by focusing on the girth of Cayley graphs of nilpotent and solvable groups, and present a series of results supporting the intuitive notion that the closer a group is to being abelian, the less suitable it is for constructing Cayley graphs of large girth. Specifically, we establish the existence of upper bounds on the girth of Cayley graphs with respect to the nilpotency class and/or the derived length of the underlying group, when this group is nilpotent or solvable, respectively. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we generalize both of these concepts by viewing them as arising from operations performed on ideals. Thus we obtain a hierarchy of large cardinal concepts and we begin to study a tree in which these concepts can be embedded. Our set theoretic notation is reasonably standard. The axiom of choice is assumed so a cardinal is identified with the set of its ordinal predecessors. The letter ~c will be reserved for cardinals, while ~, fl, etc. will represent ordinals. For yc= ~, ot(Y) is the order type of Y. cf(~) is the cofinality of~. A collection of subsets of ~c is an ideal if it is closed under subset and finite union. All of our ideals will be < ~-complete (closed under unions of size less than ~c). If I is an ideal on ~:, then I* will denote { y__c K IreYe I}, and I + will be the co-ideal { yc= ~c I Yr I}. An ideal I is normal if (VXeI+)(Vf: X ~ ) if f ( a ) < a for all e e X { 0 } , then there is some Y e I + such that Yc=x and f IY is constant. Most of our ideals will be normal.	command & conquer:yuri's revenge;embedded system;emoticon;ordinal data;set theory;stationary process	Christopher C. Leary	1990	Arch. Math.

We consider these conditions as a possible definition of what it means for a class of structures to have “Ulm type”. The result says that there can be no Turing computable embedding of a class not of Ulm type into one of Ulm type. We apply this result to show that there is no Turing computable embedding of the class of graphs into the class of “rankhomogeneous” trees. The second main result says that there is a Turing computable embedding of the class of rank-homogeneous trees into the class of torsion-free Abelian groups.

09b4f5cb98594e7d7be4f655d74c863ff4098e98	conflict complexity is lower bounded by block sensitivity		We show conflict complexity of any total boolean function, recently defined in [11] to study a composition theorem of randomized decision tree complexity, is at least a half of its block sensitivity. We also raise an interesting conjecture relating the composition theorem of randomized decision tree complexity to the long open conjecture that decision tree complexity is at most square of block sensitivity up to a constant. Let f : {0, 1} → {0, 1} be a boolean function. The conflict complexity, denoted by χ(f), is a complexity measure of a boolean function that is recently defined in [11], and appears implicitly in [4]. Using this notion, [11] and [4] independently show a composition theorem for randomized decision tree complexity. Let R(f) denote the randomized decision tree complexity of f with bounded error. It is proven in [11, 4] that R(f ◦ g) = Ω(R(f) √ R(g)) for any relation f and partial function g. Another important complexity measure of a boolean function f is its block sensitivity, denoted by bs(f), is firstly defined in [9]. Block sensitivity, its variants, and related famous sensitivity conjecture are widely studied in complexity theory and combinatorics, see e.g. [10, 7, 3, 6, 5, 1, 8] etc. The relation of block sensitivity to other complexity measures (e.g., decision tree complexity, approximate degree, etc), is relatively well understood, in particular most of them are polynomially related, see the survey [3]. In [11] it is shown that χ(f) = Ω(R(f)). Let D(f) denote the deterministic decision tree complexity of f . Later after we formally define χ(f), it will be clear that χ(f) ≤ D(f). Hence Ω(R(f)) ≤ χ(f) ≤ D(f). Since bs(f) is polynomially related to D(f) and R(f), as a result it is also polynomially related to χ(f). We show an explicit connection between them. ∗McGill university. yaqiao.li@mail.mcgill.ca	approximation algorithm;blum axioms;computational complexity theory;decision tree model;randomized algorithm	Yaqiao Li	2018	CoRR		boolean function;conjecture;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;decision tree;preprint;mathematics;bounded function	Theory	35.90123154389969	28.91886444545597	184270
ad16473b0deb3bbf6b5835cb6b2494ecab787758	randomness and the linear degrees of computability	qa mathematics;satisfiability	We show that there exists a real α such that, for all reals β, if α is linear reducible to β (α ≤` β, previously denoted as α ≤sw β) then β ≤T α. In fact, every random real satisfies this quasi-maximality property. As a corollary we may conclude that there exists no `-complete ∆2 real. Upon realizing that quasi-maximality does not characterize the random reals – there exist reals which are not random but which are of quasi-maximal `-degree – it is then natural to ask whether maximality could provide such a characterization. Such hopes, however, are in vain since no real is of maximal `-degree. c © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	computability;existential quantification;maximal set;randomness	Andrew E. M.

This parameter corresponds to the maximum number of labels we can assign to the vertices of the graph, such that we will be able to create a packing of k copies of the graph, while conserving the labels of the vertices. The authors intensively studied the labeled packing of cycles, and, among other results, they conjectured that for every cycle Cn of order n = 2k+ x, with k ≥ 2 and 1≤ x≤ 2k−1, the value of λ (Cn) was 2 if x was 1 and k was even, and x+2 otherwise. In this paper, we disprove this conjecture by giving a counter example. We however prove that it gives a valid lower bound, and we give sufficient conditions for the upper bound to hold. We then give some similar results for the labeled packing of circuits.

We use $$n/\lfloor \tfrac{k}{2}\rfloor +O(k)$$ n/⌊k2⌋+O(k) queries, improving a previous method by De Marco and Kranakis that used $$n-k+k^2/2$$ n-k+k2/2 queries. We also prove a lower bound of $$n/(k-1)-O (n^{1/3})$$ n/(k-1)-O(n1/3) on the number of queries needed, both for discrepancy queries and to queries that return the partition of items into monochromatic subsets. This improves a lower bound of $$\lfloor n/k\rfloor $$ ⌊n/k⌋ by De Marco and Kranakis.	color;discrepancy function;majority problem (cellular automaton);media queries;monochrome;oracle database;partition type;theory	David Eppstein;Daniel S.

By this, we provide a common framework that links together seemingly distant results, like the stable marriage theorem of Gale and Shapley [11], the Menelsohn-Dulmage theorem [21], the Kundu-Lawler theorem [19], Tarski’s fixed point theorem [32], the Cantor-Bernstein theorem, Pym’s linking theorem [22, 23] or the monochromatic path theorem of Sands et al. [29]. In this framework, we formulate a matroid-generalization of the stable marriage theorem and study the lattice structure of generalized stable matchings. Based on the theory of lattice polyhedra and blocking polyhedra, we extend results of Vande Vate [33] and Rothblum [28] on the bipartite stable matching polytope.	blocking (computing);cantor;crystal structure;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point arithmetic;fixed-point theorem;hall's marriage theorem;matching (graph theory);matroid;monochrome;phil bernstein;polyhedron;stable marriage problem	Tamás Fleiner	2003	Math.

We first prove that for any finite integral set T that contains 0, the asymptotic T-coloring ratio R(T ) is equal to the fractional chromatic number of the distance graph G(Z, D), where D=T&[0]. This fact is then used to study the distance graphs with distance sets of the form Dm, k=[1, 2, ..., m]&[k]. The chromatic numbers and the fractional chromatic numbers of G(Z, Dm, k) are determined for all values of m and k. Furthermore, circular chromatic numbers of G(Z, Dm, k) for some special values of m and k are obtained. 1999 Academic Press	fractional coloring;graph coloring;t-coloring	Gerard J.

It is well known according to U. Colombo (1964) that c4(T ) ≤ c4(RLTn), where RLTn is the unique regular locally transitive tournament of order n. In turn, in 1968, A. Kotzig proved that c4(DRn) ≤ c4(T ), where DRn is a doubly-regular tournament of order n. However, the spectral tools allowus to simply show that the converse inequality c5(RLTn) ≤ c5(T ) ≤ c5(DRn)holds. Recentlywehave proved that c6(T ) ≤ c6(DRn) and conjectured that c6(RLTn) ≤ c6(T ). For these values of m, the same results can be also formulated for the trace trm(T ) of the mth power of the adjacency matrix of T . (We consider this quantity here because it equals the number of closed walks of length m in T .) In the present paper, we determine c7(DRn) and c7(RLTn). Comparing c7(DRn)with c7(RLTn) yields the inequality c7(RLTn) < c7(DRn), while tr7(DRn) < tr7(RLTn) for n ≥ 7.We also present some additional argumentswhichmake it possible to suggest that for each oddn ≥ 9, the two-sidedbounds c7(RLTn) ≤ c7(T ) ≤ c7(DRn) and tr7(DRn) ≤ tr7(T ) ≤ tr7(RLTn) hold. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

6ee59e359ca1ea169a54737c76aa497e4ef10a5f	two consistency results on set mappings		It is consistent that there is a set mapping from the four-tuples of ωn into the finite subsets with no free subsets of size tn for some natural number tn. For any n < ω it is consistent that there is a set mapping from the pairs of ωn into the finite subsets with no infinite free sets. For any n < ω it is consistent that there is a set mapping from the pairs of ωn into ωn with no uncountable free sets. In this paper we consider some problems on set mappings, that is, for our current purposes, functions of the type f : [κ] → [κ] for some natural number k and cardinals κ, μ, which satisfy f(x) ∩ x = ∅ for x ∈ [κ]. A subset H of κ is called free if f(x) ∩H = ∅ holds for every x ∈ [H ]. The most central question of this area of combinatorial set theory is that given k, κ, and μ how large free sets can be guaranteed. The investigation of the case k = 1 was started in the thirties by Paul Turán, who asked if there exists an infinite free set if μ = ω and κ is the continuum. After G. Grünwald’s affirmative answer ([4]) S. Ruziewicz found the right conjecture ([10]); if κ > μ then there is a free set of cardinal κ (remember, k = 1 is assumed). Several cases were soon proved, for example S. Piccard solved the case when κ is regular ([9]), but only in 1950 was the full conjecture established by Paul Erdős ([1]) with the assumption of GCH, and ten years later without this assumption, by A. Hajnal ([5]). In the fifties Erdős and Hajnal started the research on the case k > 1 following the observation of Kuratowski and Sierpiński (see [4]) that for set mappings on [κ] there always exists a free set of cardinal k + 1 iff κ ≥ μ. In ZFC alone, Hajnal and Máté extended the Kuratowski-Sierpiński results by showing ([6]) that if k = 2 and κ ≥ μ then there are arbitrarily large finite free sets, and Hajnal proved (see [3]) that a similar result holds for k = 3, κ ≥ μ. One of the problems emphasized in [3] is if the result can be extended to k = 4, κ ≥ μ.

[J. Combinatorial Theory A  118 (2)(2011), 702---725] substituted the usual BLYM inequality for L-Sperner families with a set of M inequalities for (m1,m2,…,mM; L1,L2,…,LM) type M-part Sperner families and showed that if all inequalities hold with equality, then the family is homogeneous. Aydinian et al. [Australasian J. Comb. 48 (2010), 133---141] observed that all inequalities hold with equality if and only if the transversal of the Sperner family corresponds to a simple mixed orthogonal array with constraint M, strength M−1, using mi+1 symbols in the ith column. In this paper we define k-dimensional M-part Sperner multifamilies with parameters $L_P:~P\in\binom{[M]}{k}$ and prove $\binom{M}{k}$ BLYM inequalities for them. We show that if k<M and all inequalities hold with equality, then these multifamilies must be homogeneous with profile matrices that are strength M−k mixed orthogonal arrays. For k=M, homogeneity is not always true, but some necessary conditions are given for certain simple families. These results extend to products of posets which have the strong normalized matching property. Following the methods of Aydinian et al. [Australasian J. Comb. 48 (2010), 133---141], we give new constructions to simple mixed orthogonal arrays with constraint M, strength M−k, using mi+1 symbols in the ith column. We extend the convex hull method to k-dimensional M-part Sperner multifamilies, and allow additional conditions providing new results even for simple 1-part Sperner families.	sperner's lemma	Harout K.

9d1a7ca1f209b5ff8908997cf42693d0ceb1bbe3	multi-player last nim with passes	impartial combinatorial game;multi-player;last nim;alliance;pass	We introduce a class of impartial combinatorial games, Multi-player Last Nim with Passes, denoted by MLNim\(^{(s)}(N,n)\): there are N piles of counters which are linearly ordered. In turn, each of n players either removes any positive integer of counters from the last pile, or makes a choice ‘pass’. Once a ‘pass’ option is used, the total number s of passes decreases by 1. When all s passes are used, no player may ever ‘pass’ again. A pass option can be used at any time, up to the penultimate move, but cannot be used at the end of the game. The player who cannot make a move wins the game. The aim is to determine the game values of the positions of MLNim\(^{(s)}(N,n)\) for all integers \(N\ge 1\) and \(n\ge 3\) and \(s\ge 1\). For \(n>N+1\) or \(n=N+1\ge 3\), the game values are completely determined for any \(s\ge 1\). For \(3\le n\le N\), the game values are determined for infinitely many triplets (N, n, s). We also present a possible explanation why determining the game values becomes more complicated if \(n\le N\).	nim	Wen An Liu;Juan Yang	2018	Int. J.

In this paper, we address the problem of measuring the similarity between attributed graphs. In particular, we propose a novel way to measure the similarity through the evolution of a continuous-time quantum walk. Given a pair of graphs, we create a derived structure whose degree of symmetry is maximum when the original graphs are isomorphic, and where a subset of the edges is labeled with the similarity between the respective nodes. With this compositional structure to hand, we compute the density operators of the quantum systems representing the evolution of two suitably defined quantum walks. We define the similarity between the two original graphs as the quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence between these two density operators, and then we show how to build a novel kernel on attributed graphs based on the proposed similarity measure. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation both on synthetic and real-world data, which shows the effectiveness the proposed approach.	continuous-time quantum walk;heuristic;jensen's inequality;kernel (operating system);quantum system;shannon (unit);similarity measure;synthetic intelligence	Luca Rossi;Andrea Torsello;Edwin R.

64af5684bb388d5fbd8dabd19251e6ef3220fce5	a characterization of complete matroid base graphs		This study grew from an attempt to give a local analysis of matroid base graphs. A neighborhood-preserving covering of graphs p:G -+ N is one such that p restricted to every neighborhood in G is an isomorphism. This concept arises naturally when considering graphs with a prescribed set of local properties. A characterization is given of all connected graphs with two local properties: (a) there is a pair of adjacent points, the intersection of whose neighborhoods does not contain three mutually nonadjacent points; (b) the intersection of the neighborhoods of points two apart is a 4-cycle. Such graphs have neighborhoods of the form K, x K, for fixed n, M and are either complete matroid base graphs or are their images under neighborhood-preserving coverings. if 31 ; 331, the graph is unique; if 12 = m, there are n 3 such images which are nontrivial. These examples prove that no set of properties of bounded diameter can characterize matroid base graphs.	emoticon;graph (discrete mathematics);matroid	J. D. Donald;C. A. Holzmann;M. D. Tobey	1977	J.

In terms of h(k)(G), the k-fold Hall number of a graph G, this result is stated as h(C4)=2k− k/3 . For longer cycles it is known that h(Cn)=2k, for n odd, and 2k− k/ (n−1) ≤h(Cn)≤2k, for n even. Here we show the lower bound for n even, and conjecture that this is the right value (just as for C4). We prove that if G is the diamond (a fourcycle with a diagonal), then h(k)(G)=2k. Combining these results with those published earlier we obtain a characterization of graphs G with h(k)(G)=k. As a tool in the proofs we obtain and apply an elementary generalization of the classical Hall–Rado–Halmos–Vaughan theorem on pairwise disjoint subset representatives with prescribed cardinalities. 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Then there are infinitely many k-color-critical graphs on S if and only if 3 k 5. In particular, if k 5, then there exists a polynomially bounded algorithm for deciding if a graph on S can be k-colored. We extend this to the case where a subgraph of fixed cardinality is precolored. We also establish a corresponding list-color theorem. 1997 Academic Press	algorithm	Carsten Thomassen	1997	J. Comb.

[(Meta) kernelization, in Proceedings of the 50th IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), IEEE Computer Society, 2009, pp. 629--638] on graphs of bounded genus, then generalized by Fomin et al. [Bidimensionality and kernels, in Proceedings of the 21st ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), SIAM, Philadephia, 2010, pp. 503--510] to graphs excluding a fixed minor, and by Kim et al. [Linear kernels and single-exponential algorithms via protrusion decompositions, in Proceedings of the 40th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP), Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci., 7965 (2013), pp. 613--624] to graphs excluding a fixed topological minor. Typically, these results guarantee the existence of linear or polynomial kernels on sparse graph classes for problems satisfying some generic conditions, but, mainly due to their generality, it is not clear how to derive from them constructive kernels with explicit constants. In this paper, we make a step toward a fully constructive meta-kernelization theory on sparse graphs. Our approach is based on a more explicit protrusion replacement machinery that, instead of expressibility in counting monadic second order logic, uses dynamic programming, which allows us to find an explicit upper bound on the size of the derived kernels. We demonstrate the usefulness of our techniques by providing the first explicit linear kernels for $r$-Dominating Set and $r$-Scattered Set on apex-minor-free graphs, and for Planar-$\mathcal{F}$-Deletion on graphs excluding a fixed (topological) minor in the case where all the graphs in $\mathcal{F}$ are connected.	dynamic programming	Valentin Garnero;Christophe Paul;Ignasi Sau;Dimitrios M.

83b662bfed6a59cc1845f3c787e9ddaf77b1671d	constructing edge-disjoint steiner paths in lexicographic product networks		Dirac showed that in a   (k−1)      (  k  −  1  )        -connected graph there is a path through each  k  vertices. The path  k -connectivity  π k  ( G ) of a graph  G , which is a generalization of Dirac’s notion, was introduced by Hager in 1986. It is natural to introduce the concept of path  k -edge-connectivity  ω k  ( G ) of a graph  G . Denote by  G  ○  H  the lexicographic product of two graphs  G  and  H   . In this paper, we prove that              ω  3    (  G  ∘  H  )   ≥   ω  3    (  G  )    ⌊    3  |  V  (  H  )  |   4   ⌋          for any two graphs  G  and  H . Moreover, the bound is sharp. We also derive an upper bound of  ω  3 ( G  ○  H   ), that is,   ω 3 (G∘H)≤min{2ω 3 (G)|V(H)| 2 ,δ(H)+δ(G)|V(H)|}       ω  3     (  G  ∘  H  )   ≤  min  {  2    ω  3      (  G  )   |  V   (  H  )   |   2   ,  δ   (  H  )   +   δ   (  G  )   |  V   (  H  )   |  }         .

ac28baaac3d49ee9342e097b9a4296ba598868ff	on caps and cap partitions of galois projective spaces	projective space;point of view	Let PG(N, q) be the projective space of dimension N over the finite field GF (q). A k–cap K in PG(N, q) is a set of k points, no three of which are collinear [16], and a k–cap is called complete if it is maximal with respect to set–theoretic inclusion. The maximum value of k for which there exists a k–cap in PG(N, q) is denoted by m2(N, q). This number m2(N, q) is only known, for arbitrary q, when N ∈ {2, 3}. Namely, m2(2, q) = q + 1 if q is odd, m2(2, q) = q + 2 if q is even, and m2(3, q) = q 2 + 1, q > 2. With respect to the other values of m2(N, q), apart from m2(N, 2) = 2 N , m2(4, 3) = 20, m2(5, 3) = 56, only upper bounds are known. Finding the exact value for m2(N, q), N ≥ 4 and constructing an m2(N, q)–cap seems to be a very hard problem. Partitions of projective spaces into caps have recently received some attention. In this direction, B.C. Kestenband [18] and later on G.L. Ebert [8] adopting a different method, proved that the projective space PG(2n, q) can be partitioned into caps of size (q + 1)/(q + 1). Also, G.L. Ebert [8] proved that PG(2n − 1, q), n even can be partitioned into caps of size q+1. Moreover, these partitions are neverthless “uniform”, in the sense that the objects have all the same geometric nature. Sometimes it is impossible to partition a given projective geometry uniformly (on arithmetic grounds) although a uniform partition may become possible if one or more objects of a given kind are removed. We shall call such a non–uniform partition a mixed partition of a projective geometry. B.C. Kestenband [19] proved the existence of a mixed partition of PG(2n − 1, q) consisting of two (n − 1)–subspaces and q − 1 caps of size (q − 1)/(q − 1). Also, using the process of “lifting ” a collineation of PG(2, q) to a collineation of PG(5, q) preserving a quadric Veronesean, it was shown in [3] the existence of a mixed partition of PG(5, q) consisting of two planes and q − 1 quadric Veroneseans. In this paper we will study some “special” caps and cap–partitions (mixed partitions) from a group–theretic point of view. The idea is that if a configuration of points in a projective space is “special”, for instance a cap is	ebert test;grammatical framework;lambda lifting;maximal set;spaces;theory	Antonio Cossidente;Oliver H.

ca7209e51c4536a822e4a36ef396d4b131004ce8	two embedding theorems for data with equivalences under finite group action		There is recent interest in compressing data sets for non-sequential settings, where lack of obvious orderings on their data space, require notions of data equivalences to be considered. For example, Varshney & Goyal (DCC, 2006) considered multiset equivalences, while Choi & Szpankowski (IEEE Trans. IT, 2012) considered isomorphic equivalences in graphs. Here equivalences are considered under a relatively broad framework finite-dimensional, nonsequential data spaces with equivalences under group action, for which analogues of two wellstudied embedding theorems are derived: the Whitney embedding theorem and the JohnsonLindenstrauss lemma. Only the canonical data points need to be carefully embedded, each such point representing a set of data points equivalent under group action. Two-step embeddings are considered. First, a group invariant is applied to account for equivalences, and then secondly, a linear embedding takes it down to low-dimensions. Our results require hypotheses on discriminability of the applied invariant, such notions related to seperating invariants (Dufresne, 2008), and completeness in pattern recognition (Kakarala, 1992). Our first theorem shows that almost all such two-step embeddings can one-to-one embed the canonical part of a bounded, discriminable set of data points, if embedding dimension exceeds 2k whereby k is the box-counting dimension of the set closure of canonical data points. Our second theorem shows for k equal to the number of canonical points of a finite data set, a randomly sampled two-step embedding, preserves isometries (of the canonical part) up to factors 1 ± with probability at least 1− β, if the embedding dimension exceeds (2 log k + log(1/β))/α( , δ) for some function α, and δ is a positive constant capturing a certain discriminability property of the invariant. In the second theorem, the value k is tied only to the canonical part, which may be significantly smaller than the ambient data dimension, up to a factor equal to the size the group. ∗F.

19f1c2b7edf7d22c75d740d66489b5fd3513fe35	the axiom of choice for well-ordered families and for familes of well-orderable sets		We show that it is not possible to construct a Fraenkel-Mostowski model in which the axiom of choice for well ordered families of sets and the axiom of choice for sets for well orderable sets are both true, but the axiom of choice is false. We are concerned with the following two consequences of the axiom of choice: C(WO,∞): Every well ordered collection of sets has a choice function. C(∞,WO): Every collection of well orderable sets has a choice function. It is known that C(WO,∞) does not imply the Axiom of Choice (AC) in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF) ([4, p 127] and [8]) nor is C(WO,∞) a theorem of ZF (without AC) ([4, p 123 thm 8.3], [5] and [7]). Similarly C(∞,WO) does not imply AC ([6] and [4, p 82, prob. 5.22]) nor is C(∞,WO) a theorem of ZF ([4, prob 7.12]). (In Cohen’s original model of ZF – AC ([1]), in which there is a countable set of generic reals along with a set collecting them, C(∞,WO) is true and C(WO,∞) is false. Mostowski’s linearly ordered Fraenkel-Mostowski (FM) model has this same property. Feferman’s model of ZF – AC ([2]) in which there is a countable set of generic reals, but no set to collect them, has the property that C(WO,∞) is true, but C(∞,WO) is false. An FM model that has this same property is a variation of Fraenkel’s basic model in which the set of atoms, A, is uncountable, the group, G, is the group of all permutations of A, and the filter of subgroups of G is the set of subgroups of G that leave a countable subset of A pointwise fixed.) The question of whether or not C(WO,∞) ∧ C(∞,WO) implies AC is open. Our purpose is to show that there is no FM model in which both C(WO,∞) and C(∞,WO) are true, but AC is false. It has been shown by Howard ([3]) that in every FM model, C(∞,WO) is equivalent to C(∞, < א0), AC for a family of finite sets. In the proof below we use C(∞, < א0) rather than C(∞,WO). Assume that N is an FM model determined by the the set of atoms A, the group G of permutations of A, and the filter Γ of subgroups of G. Assume that C(WO,∞) and C(∞,WO) are true inN and that AC is false.

8d7c34f264737db8a6b62dffccbac877a376b5e1	infima in the recursively enumerable weak truth table degrees	turing degree	x0. Introduction and Notation. Weak truth table reducibility (w-reducibility) was rst introduced by Friedberg and Rogers [FR59]. Intuitively, we say that a set A is w-reducible to a set B (written A w B) if there is a Turing reduction from A to B and a recursive function f such that, for any x, the value f(x) bounds the greatest number whose membership or nonmembership in B is used to determine A(x). Since w-reducibility is a stronger reducibility than Turing reducibility, each Turing degree can be partitioned into the w-degrees of its sets. Ladner and Sasso [LS75] showed that there exists a nonzero contiguous degree, i.e., an r.e. Turing degree which contains a single r.e. w-degree. The existence of such contiguous degrees, as well as the strongly contiguous degrees introduced by Downey [Do87], has been used to establish numerous existence results (cf. [LS75], [St83], [Am84a]) in the r.e. Turing degrees by establishing the corresponding results in the r.e. w-degrees. Our results here deal with in ma in the r.e. w-degrees, thus continuing the investigations of Cohen [Co75], Ambos-Spies [Am85], and Fischer [Fi86]. Cohen's result that every incomplete r.e. w-degree is w-branching and Fischer's result that some initial segments of the r.e. w-degrees are lattices indicate that in ma are more common in the r.e. w-degrees than in the r.e.

3f86eda5c060ef04842e93aeb0706c5c104bf10a	the doyen-wilson theorem for 3-sun systems		A solution to the existence problem of G -designs with given subdesigns is known when G is a triangle with p  = 0, 1, or 2 disjoint pendent edges: for p  = 0 , it is due to Doyen and Wilson, the first to pose such a problem for Steiner triple systems; for p  = 1 and p  = 2 , the corresponding designs are kite systems and bull designs, respectively. Here, a complete solution to the problem is given in the remaining case where G is a 3 -sun, i.e. a graph on six vertices consisting of a triangle with three pendent edges which form a 1 -factor.

For every n, let M(n,D) be the maximum of the cardinality of a set of Hamiltonian paths in the complete graph Kn such that the union of any two paths from the family contains a not necessarily induced cycle of some length from D. We determine or bound the asymptotics of M(n,D) in various special cases. This problem is closely related to that of the permutation capacity of graphs and constitutes a further extension of the problem area around Shannon capacity. We also discuss how to generalize our cycle-difference problems and present an example where cycles are replaced by 4-cliques. These problems are in a natural duality to those of graph intersection, initiated by Erdős, Simonovits and Sós. The lack of kernel structure as a natural candidate for optimum makes our problems quite challenging. A talk based on the material in this paper is accepted for presentation at the EuroComb’11 conference.

A variety is said to be strongly abelian if for any term in , the quasi-identity holds in . In [1] it was proved that if a strongly abelian variety has less than the maximal possible uncountable spectrum, then it is equivalent to a multisorted unary variety. Using Shelahu0027s Main Gap theorem one can conclude that if is a classifiable (superstable without DOP or OTOP and shallow) strongly abelian variety then is a multisorted unary variety. In fact, it was known that this conclusion followed from the assumption of superstable without DOP alone. This paper is devoted to the proof that the superstability assumption is enough to obtain the same structure result. This fulfills a promise made in [2]. Namely, we will prove the following Theorem 0.1. If is a superstable strongly abelian variety, then it is multisorted unary .	addendum	Bradd Hart;Sergei Starchenko	1993	J. Symb.

The Sauer inequality states that in general, a set system F shatters at least |F| sets. Here we concentrate on the case of equality. A set system is called shattering-extremal if it shatters exactly |F| sets. In this paper we characterize shattering-extremal set systems of Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension 2 in terms of their inclusion graphs, and as a corollary we answer an open question about leaving out elements from shattering-extremal set systems in the case of families of Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension 2.	alexey chervonenkis;social inequality;system f;vc dimension	Tamás Mészáros;Lajos Rónyai	2014	Electr.
