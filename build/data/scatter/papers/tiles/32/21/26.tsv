However, the price is the increasing system complexity, which makes the performance analysis of the corresponding channel a more challenging task. To this end, we develop the probability density function (PDF) of the composite cascade channel, and later analyze the outage probability (OP), the bit error rate (BER), and the ergodic capacity over this channel. Firstly, the exact PDF of the small-scale cascade channel, which is combined by several independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh/Nakagami-m channels, is derived. Then, considering the large-scale and the lognormal distributed shadow, the PDF of the composite cascade channel, following the OP, the BER, and the ergodic capacity performance under the optimal selection combining (OSC) and the maximal ratio combining (MRC) schemes are also deduced. Furthermore, in order to obtain the asymptotic lines of the BER and the ergodic capacity performance, the mixture gamma distribution is exploited. The closed-form expressions for these two kinds of asymptotic lines, both under the OSC and the MRC schemes, are proposed. The numerical simulations confirm that the proposed expressions fit well with the Monte-Carlo results.	bit error rate;decibel;delta modulation;ergodic theory;ergodicity;maximal set;mg (editor);monte carlo method;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;portable document format;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh–ritz method;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sun outage;x.690	Haibin Liu;Liangjun Xiang;Linhua Zheng;Hong Ding	2015	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-015-2836-x	bit error rate;telecommunications;asymptotic curve;diversity scheme;statistics	Mobile	38.33020873690532	78.27953891814344	153550

The locations of the Base Stations (BSs) are modeled as points of a Poisson Point Process (PPP) and stochastic geometry is used for system-level performance assessment. The approximation is applicable to spatial multiplexing Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems having an arbitrary number of antennas at the transmitter (Nt) and at the receiver (Nr). A Rayleigh fading channel model is assumed. The accuracy of the proposed approximation is substantiated with the aid of Monte Carlo simulations.	approximation;channel (communications);mimo;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;point process;rayleigh fading;simulation;spatial multiplexing;telecommunications link;transmitter	Peng Guan;Marco Di Renzo	2015	2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146109	stochastic geometry models of wireless networks;mathematical optimization;3g mimo;electronic engineering;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;mathematics;spatial multiplexing	Robotics	37.52772602793286	79.65834277500504	154777
8fe41202b48eac40d6ae9c9cc1e7c9071cc22b11	optimizing pilot overhead for ultra-reliable short-packet transmission		In this paper we optimize the pilot overhead for ultra-reliable short-packet transmission and investigate the dependence of this overhead on packet size and error probability. In particular, we consider a point-to-point communication in which one sensor sends messages to a central node, or base-station, over AWGN with Rayleigh fading channel. We formalize the optimization in terms of approximate achievable rates at a given block length, pilot length, and error probability. This leads to more accurate pilot overhead optimization. Simulation results show that it is important to take into account the packet size and the error probability when optimizing the pilot overhead.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;block code;mathematical optimization;network packet;optimizing compiler;overhead (computing);point-to-point protocol;point-to-point (telecommunications);rayleigh fading;simulation	Mohammadreza Mousaei;Besma Smida	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7996416	central node;real-time computing;probability of error;additive white gaussian noise;computer science;rayleigh fading;network packet;signal-to-noise ratio;transmission (mechanics);communication channel	EDA	33.28605009261779	78.50073019303397	154852

Given transmit power, DSF essentially decreases probability of packet error (PPE) by increasing the signal energy per information bit. It, however, doubles the time duration needed for transmitting the original packet. On the other hand, HSF increases PPE. It, however halves the time duration required to carry the original packet. Thus, the efficiency of HSF in DSF as a retransmission strategy depends on the amount of increased or reduced PPF after HSF or DSF is selected. With achieving given residual error probability (REP) in CDMA systems, the effective throughput is evaluated in this paper to find conditions with which HSF or DSF achieves better performance than using the original one. Analytic results show that HSF or DSF performs better when relatively small or big changes in their PPE's are present, respectively.

We first give the closed-form expressions of the link outage probability under asymmetrical cases, in which the targeted data transmission rates in the bidirectional links are different. Based on the analytical expressions, we further analytically derive the exact expressions of the system outage probability with asymmetric traffic requirements.

An optimum scheme to minimise the outage probability is formulated, and a closed form expression for the ‘channeldependent’ combining coefficient ‘α’ at the relay is derived. A novel approach is presented to derive an expression for the overall outage probability of the proposed three-phase outage-optimal two-way relaying (3P-OTWR) system. The authors also perform finite signal-to-noise (SNR) diversity-multiplexing tradeoff and throughput analysis of the system. Furthermore, the problem of outage-optimum power allocation is investigated. Using the asymptotic expression for the outage probability, it is shown that there is loss of diversity owing to interference at the relay. The authors perform Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that the 3P-OTWR system outperforms a conventional three-phase two-way scheme. With outage-optimum power allocation, the proposed scheme achieves a gain of approximately 3 dB in the medium-to-high SNR regime over a conventional scheme with α = 0.5 and equal power at terminals. The proposed three-phase scheme in presence of co-channel interference can provide a better throughput for higher transmission rates as compared with a two-phase scheme when operated in the high SNR regime. Numerical results demonstrate accuracy of the derived expressions.	coefficient;downtime;interference (communication);internet relay chat;monte carlo method;multiplexing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;throughput;two-phase commit protocol	A.

The main features and contributions of the proposed cooperative transmission strategy are as follows. First, entropy-based relay selection is used to improve data transmission reliability from a source node to a destination node.

The capacity of the finite-field three-way channel is derived, and is shown to be achievable using a non-cooperative scheme without feedback. The same scheme is also shown to achieve the equal-rate capacity (when all nodes transmit at the same rate) of the sender-symmetrical (each node receives the same SNR from the other two nodes) phase-fading AWGN channel. In the light that the non-cooperative scheme is not optimal in general, a cooperative feedback scheme that utilizes relaying and network coding is proposed and is shown to achieve the equal-rate capacity of the reciprocal (each pair of nodes has the same forward and backward SNR) phase-fading AWGN three-way channel.	additive white gaussian noise;linear network coding;signal-to-noise ratio	Lawrence Ong	2012	2012 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2012.6380944	linear network coding;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;channel capacity;statistics;computer network	Mobile	34.631708775331106	75.73453356321421	156615

Using the optimal channel-assigning policy that assigns the channel to only one user with the best channel gain (R Knopp et al., 1995), our emphasis is on the effects of channel feedback delay in downlink transmissions. A finite set of M-QAM constellations is adopted and a constant transmit power is assumed in this practical scenario. Based on the closed-form expressions for exact and approximate average BER and sum throughput we derive under the outdated channel feedback model, we illustrate the impact of channel feedback delay on the achievable multiuser diversity gain with the number of users. Simple and accurate asymptotic approximations are also provided in the limit of large number of users. A novel robust constant power, variable rate M-QAM scheme that is less sensitive to feedback delay is proposed using the optimal set of switching thresholds, which is derived to maximize the average sum throughput subject to an average BER constraint.	approximation algorithm;feedback;multi-user;telecommunications link;theory;throughput;x.690	Qian Ma;Cihan Tepedelenlioglu	2004	2004 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (IEEE Cat.

In contrast with the flat fading Rayleigh case, no closed-form expressions for the eigenvectors of the optimum input covariance matrix are available. Classically, both the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are computed numerically and the corresponding optimization algorithms remain computationally very demanding. In this paper, it is proposed to optimize (w.r.t. the input covariance matrix) a large system approximation of the average mutual information derived by Moustakas and Simon. The validity of this asymptotic approximation is clarified thanks to Gaussian large random matrices methods. It is shown that the approximation is a strictly concave function of the input covariance matrix and that the average mutual information evaluated at the argmax of the approximation is equal to the capacity of the channel up to a O(1/t) term, where t is the number of transmit antennas. An algorithm based on an iterative waterfilling scheme is proposed to maximize the average mutual information approximation, and its convergence studied. Numerical simulation results show that, even for a moderate number of transmit and receive antennas, the new approach provides the same results as direct maximization approaches of the average mutual information.	approximation;concave function;expectation–maximization algorithm;iterative method;mimo;mathematical optimization;mutual information;numerical analysis;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation	Florian Dupuy;Philippe Loubaton	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2011.2162190	computer simulation;estimation of covariance matrices;mathematical optimization;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;covariance;mathematics;statistics;covariance function	Robotics	38.915540440715816	74.93498245185741	156858

A new scheme named aggressive transmission with ARQ (AT-ARQ) is developed and optimized to provide better performance, at the expense of requiring ARQ feedback. Optimal power allocation among (re)transmissions is derived. A comprehensive performance comparison of the three schemes, under different performance metrics such as throughput, outage probability, and the combination of two, is reported via numerical simulations. Substantial performance improvement is observed with even 1-bit ARQ feedback in Rayleigh fading.	1-bit architecture;computer simulation;downtime;layer (electronics);numerical analysis;rayleigh fading;throughput	Cong Shen;Tie Liu;Michael P.

f94548eb2505b656c8c2c45abd359eb3411fa1fe	iterative network-channel decoding with cooperative space-time transmission		One of the most efficient methods of exploiting space diversity for portable wireless devices is cooperative communication utilizing space-time block codes. In cooperative communication, users besides communicating their own information, also relay the information of other users. In this paper we investigate a scheme where cooperation is achieved using two methods, namely, distributed space-time coding and network coding. Two cooperating users utilize Alamouti space time code for inter-user cooperation and in addition utilize a third relay which performs network coding. The third relay does not have any of its information to be sent. In this paper we propose a scheme utilizing convolutional code based network coding, instead of conventional XOR based network code and utilize iterative joint networkchannel decoder for efficient decoding. Extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis is performed to investigate the convergence property of the proposed decoder.	alternating bit protocol;bcjr algorithm;coding theory;convolutional code;exit chart;exclusive or;iteration;iterative method;linear network coding;mike lesser;relay;simulation interoperability standards organization	Saikat Majumder;Shrish Verma	2014	CoRR	10.5121/ijasuc.2014.5602	telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science	Web+IR	34.49537756234501	75.73704529718226	157793

It has attracted lots of research attention in recent years. An important question in cooperative communication is power allocation. Given the same total power, how much should be allocated to self-information transmission and how much to relayinginformation transmission. In this paper, we investigate power allocation problem using amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol considering bit error rate (BER) performance of both users and the work region of two cooperative users. We solve cooperative ratio, which is defined as the ratio of power used for cooperative transmission over the total power. We first consider both users applying the same ratio, and then extend to two-dimensional cooperative ratio problem. Our results show that it is sufficient to allocate both users the same ratio. This value is specified by the user with a weaker channel gain to the destination, i.e., bottleneck link. With appropriate selection of the cooperative ratio, the BER performance of both users can be improved significantly. User fairness is also considered in the analysis.	additive white gaussian noise;anisotropic filtering;bit error rate;bottleneck (network);cooperative mimo;direction finding;fairness measure;numerical partial differential equations;overhead (computing);rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;self-information;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;tree accumulation;x.690	Lian Zhao;Zaiyi Liao	2008	JCM	10.4304/jcm.3.3.33-42	bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;cooperative diversity;statistics	ECom	36.05064186416487	79.41168048308731	158023

By CSI estimation rates we mean how much the receivers' tracking loops are fast to estimate the channel gains over the individual time slots. The fading links are considered to be frequency-flat time-varying Rayleigh fading and modeled by a first-order autoregressive process (AR1). General closed-form approximate expression is derived for the outage probability, which is further verified through Monte Carlo simulation. The derived expression is valid for time-varying as well as quasi-static fading links for both low and high CSI estimation rates. Furthermore, we analytically show that, due to high speeds of the cooperating-nodes, the outage probability experiences asymptotic floor which could be completely eliminated by well-designed fast tracking loops at the receivers. This outage performance is also investigated under different nodes mobility scenarios.	anisotropic filtering;approximation algorithm;autoregressive model;channel state information;computer simulation;consensus dynamics;downtime;first-order predicate;maximal set;monte carlo method;numerical linear algebra;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;relay;simulation;sun outage	Yazid M.

Different from the conventional estimate-and-forward (EF) protocol, the proposed protocol forwards 1-bit soft information at the relay. We employ the joint trellis coded quantization/modulation (TCQ/M) to implement 1-bit transmission of the soft information. Also, the codebooks in the TCQ are designed to be adaptive to the source-to-relay channel conditions so that the system can achieve the full diversity gain over fading channels. Specifically, in the low source-to-relay channel SNR region, we apply the TCQ/M to the soft information based on the codebook generated by the LloydMax quantizer. In the high source-to-relay channel SNR region, where the soft information is equivalent to its hard decision, we design the codebook by repeating the soft information. It has been shown that the proposed protocol outperforms both the amplify-and-forward (AF) and the decode-and-forward (DF) protocols over fading channels.	1-bit architecture;codebook;direction finding;entity framework;linear network coding;modulation;quantization (signal processing);relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;tagged command queuing;trellis quantization	Yiwen Li;Zihuai Lin;Jun Li;Branka Vucetic	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666112	communications protocol;linear network coding;trellis modulation;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;relay channel;computer network	Mobile	34.532021891666055	75.79179793684153	158704

bac7aa182be6b93cf59ff1159dbc0410561eb3a7	performance analysis and optimal signal detection for amplify-and-forward relay in diffusion-based molecular communication systems		Molecular communication (MC) is a promising paradigm which utilizes molecules to implement communication among nano-machines. Due to short transmit range, amplify-and-forward (AF) relay is used to extend the communication distance and achieve a reliable remote communications in diffusion-based MC systems. In this paper, an AF relay strategy in diffusion-based MC systems is researched, in which the capture probability function is formulated by searching for the essence of AF, and the distribution of the number of molecules received at the receiver is modeled as an approximate normal distribution. The impact of AF relay location and the signal detection threshold on the system performance are exploited, and the optimal signal detection threshold is derived by using the maximum a posteriori probability. The simulation results show that the proposed AF relay strategy can effectively improve the system performance, and the optimal relay location can achieve the best performance.	anisotropic filtering;approximation algorithm;bit error rate;detection theory;direction finding;gnu nano;internet relay chat;performance;profiling (computer programming);programming paradigm;simulation	Jiaxing Wang;Shuo Yuan;Mugen Peng	2017	2017 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2017.8330339	probability of error;probability density function;real-time computing;computer science;maximum a posteriori estimation;molecular communication;normal distribution;relay;detection theory	Mobile	37.04852451025526	77.44486669981517	160755

0c81716b8ee75711ba4de0c1095c0f93705571bc	generalized asymptotic measures for wireless fading channels with a logarithmic singularity		In wireless channels, the received signal to noise ratio (SNR) can be represented as amp;#947; = amp;#946;amp;#947;, where amp;#947; is the average SNR and amp;#946; is a random variable with probability density function (PDF) f (amp;#946;). In this paper, we analyze the high SNR performance of wireless channels with a logarithmic singularity. That is, f (amp;#946;) = aamp;#946;t #x002B; bamp;#946;amp;#x00B5; log(amp;#946;) #x002B; amp;#183; amp;#183; amp;#183; near amp;#946; = 0. This logarithmic singularity (LS) is critically important in determining the high SNR performance and appears to have been completely overlooked. Important special cases include Gamma-Gamma and Generalized-K channels. For instance, the GG has been used to model scattering, reflection, and diffraction and optical, navigation and relay channels [1]. This versatility highlights the importance of LS wireless channels. Classical asymptotic or high SNR analysis is developed by expanding f (amp;#946;) = aamp;#946;t #x002B; amp;#183; amp;#183; amp;#183; near amp;#946; = 0 and expressing the diversity and coding gain as direct functions of a and t. However, as this monomial expansion does not hold for LS channels, we develop generalized asymptotic performance measures for outage and error rates. The results show significantly improved accuracy in the SNR range of 10-25 dB. For this range, our new asymptotic expressions achieve much better accuracy than the conventional ones that ignore this singularity.	asymptote;coding gain;gadu-gadu;gamma correction;least squares;monomial;portable document format;reflection (computer programming);relay;signal-to-noise ratio;singularity project;sun outage	Bitan Banerjee;Chintha Tellambura	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925518	telecommunications;control theory;mathematics	Mobile	38.412675753245836	74.64455091314326	161374

The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by Monte-Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that a cross-layer design further improves the performance gain provided by the CoopMAC protocol over that of the legacy 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), enhancing both the achievable network throughput and the outage probability.	access control;design rule for camera file system;downtime;duplex (telecommunications);lucas–lehmer–riesel test;monte carlo method;multiplexing;network packet;relay;selection algorithm;simulation;sun outage;throughput	Alessandro Crismani;Fulvio Babich;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493878	throughput;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;statistics;computer network;monte carlo method	Mobile	34.754219985782775	78.20314432589285	161377

The MIMO scheme is based on Alamouti space-time block coding (STBC) over Rayleigh flat fading channels. The source node, equipped with two transmit antennas, simply broadcasts each STBC code to the relay and the destination nodes. Then, the relay node, equipped with multiple antennas, amplifies-and-forwards (AF) the received STBC codes. Finally, the destination node uses maximum ratio combining (MRC) and exploits the diversity gain obtained through the direct and the indirect links simultaneously. Lower bounds of the symbol error probability (SEP) and the outage probability are derived using the moment generating function (MGF) of the total signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a particular signal of M-ary-quadrature-amplitude modulation (M-QAM). Subsequently, simulation results are provided to verify the validity of the analytical results.	anisotropic filtering;code;downtime;modulation;multi-user mimo;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh–ritz method;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;symantec endpoint protection	Abderrazek Abdaoui;Salama S.

While transmit diversity techniques have been extensively studied for point-to-point communications, their applications in wireless multicast scenario have not been fully exploited. In this paper, we first design an adaptive transmit antenna array for multicasting, with the assumption of perfect channel information at the transmitter and the performance criteria as maximizing the worst signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among all receivers. Compared with the existing beamforming scheme that aims to maximize the average SNR, a performance gain in decoding bit error rate is obtained. Then, the proposed close-loop scheme is compared with space-time block coding that does not require feedback of channel information. When the number of multicast receivers is below a certain threshold, the proposed close-loop scheme outperforms the space-time codes. When the multicast group size is large, the space-time codes have better performance. Finally, jointly considering close loop and open loop techniques based on group size and availability of channel information feedback is suggested.	beamforming;bit error rate;code;data rate units;multicast;point-to-point (telecommunications);signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Yan Sun;K.

As higher Rician factor leads to reduced spatial correlation effects, it is essential to analyze the influence of Rician factor over system performance. In this work, Loo channel model is considered. The probability density function of this model exhibits a non-zero mean emphasizing the presence of LOS component in addition to scattering and multipath fading effects and hence leading to high Rician factor.

Compared with the conventional distributed quantizers where each receiver quantizes its own channel independently, the proposed quantizers allow multiple rounds of feedback communication in the form of conferencing between receivers. We take the network outage probabilities of sum rate and minimum rate as performance measures and consider quantizer design in the transmission strategies of time sharing and interference transmission. First, we propose distributed quantizers that achieve the optimal network outage probability of sum rate for both time sharing and interference transmission strategies with an average feedback rate of only two bits per channel state. Then, for the time sharing strategy, we propose a distributed quantizer that achieves the optimal network outage probability of minimum rate with finite average feedback rate; conventional quantizers require infinite rate to achieve the same performance. For the interference transmission strategy, a distributed quantizer that can approach the optimal network outage probability of minimum rate closely is also proposed. Numerical simulations confirm that our distributed quantizers based on conferencing outperform the conventional ones.	adaptive system;color depth;distributed database;downtime;ibm notes;interference (communication);numerical linear algebra;quantization (signal processing);simulation;sun outage;time-sharing;transmission (bittorrent client)	Xiaoyi Leo Liu;Erdem Koyuncu;Hamid Jafarkhani	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037053	database index;transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;interference	Mobile	36.025826838612765	76.57901060990713	162182

Numerical results show that the link correlation has a considerable effect on blind and semiblind fixed-gain relaying when the source-to-destination and source-to-relay links are correlated, whereas for variable-gain relaying, it has a considerable effect when the source-to-destination and source-to-relay links are correlated or when the relay-to-destination and source-to-destination links are correlated. Moreover, the effect of correlation is often noticeable when the correlation coefficient is larger than 0.5.	anisotropic filtering;coefficient;profiling (computer programming);relay	Yunfei Chen;Rui Shi;Min Long	2013	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2013.2241093	electronic engineering;telecommunications;electrical engineering;antenna	Mobile	38.26935439448909	77.64245281960197	162193
7ebe14b257851329b2c21b80691472386b00d679	transmission strategies and performance analysis of resource-constrained wireless relay networks	doctoral thesis	Demand for mobile and personal communications is growing at a rapid pace, both in terms of the number of potential users and introduction of new high-speed services. Meeting this demand is challenging since wireless communications are subject to four major constraints: A complex and harsh fading channels, a scarce usable radio spectrum, and limitations on the power and size of hand-held terminals. Space-time codes provide diversity and coding gains in multiple antenna systems over fading channels. However, in ad-hoc or distributed large scale wireless networks, nodes are often constrained in hardware complexity and size, which makes multiple antenna systems impractical for certain applications. Cooperative diversity schemes have been introduced in an effort to overcome this limitation. Cooperative techniques allow a collection of radios to relay signals amongst each other, effectively creating a virtual antenna array, which combat multipath fading in wireless channels. In resource constrained networks, such as wireless sensor networks, the advantages of cooperation can be further exploited by optimally allocating the energy and bandwidth resources among users based on the available channel state information (CSI) at each node. In this thesis, we consider the design of practical distributed space-time codes and power efficient fading mitigation techniques for wireless relay networks. We show that using the proposed techniques the system performance is significantly improved under the respective resource constraints such as the energy, bit-error rate, or outage probability. Furthermore, the performance analysis of the wireless relay networks under different protocols and fading channels are investigated. We derive formulas for the symbol error rate (SER), outage probability, and diversity order of the investigated schemes in fading channels. For sufficiently large SNR, the close-form average symbol error probabilities are derived for the number of the distributed wireless systems.

We derive new closed-form and generalized expressions for connection and secrecy outage probability. Next, we investigate asymptotic behavior of the outage probability for high signal-to-noise ratio in main channel between the legitimate user and the transmitter. The asymptotic analysis provides new insights about actual diversity provided by MRC with weighting errors. We substantiate our claims with the analytic results and numerical evaluations.	downtime;elegant degradation;eve;maximal set;numerical analysis;numerical method;signal-to-noise ratio;sun outage;transmitter	Anish Prasad Shrestha;Kyung Sup Kwak	2014	IEEE Communications Letters		telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;maximal-ratio combining;statistics	Mobile	38.04208171972003	78.06868097136834	163576

To reach that end, a closed-from expression for the moment-generating function of the total signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at the destination is derived in terms of the tabulated Meijer’s G-function. Since it is hard to determine the exact probability distribution function of the SNR, a tight lower bound approximation is proposed. Simulation results are presented that show that the outage probability lower bound tends to be tight at high SNR values thus verifying the analytical results. The results also show the potential gain of relaying on the outage probability.	approximation;approximation algorithm;computer simulation;downtime;emoticon;numerical analysis;portable document format;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sun outage;time complexity;verification and validation;world wide web	Abdelrahman H.

This protocol is analyzed in terms of the average sum-rate and average symbol error rate considering independent Rayleigh fading channels. Bounds of these performance criteria are provided in closed-form expressions for the semi-blind and channel state information (CSI)-assisted relaying. The performance of the incremental semi-blind opportunistic AF relaying is compared to the performance of incremental CSI-assisted opportunistic AF relaying in order to prove the validity of the proposed analysis. We illustrate that the incremental semi-blind opportunistic AF relaying reduces significantly the system complexity for the cost of a slight decrease in the system performance.	anisotropic filtering	Wided Hadj Alouane;Noureddine Hamdi	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3852-1	computer science;real-time computing;word error rate;computer network;channel state information;expression (mathematics);rayleigh fading;communication channel	Mobile	35.84058213896933	78.02681646606902	164078

The proposed system works as an overlay cellular network. The CU having weak channel towards the base station exploits the availability of a pair of wireless terminals intending to communicate directly with each other. These intermediate device-to-device communications users use network coding to forward CUs' information to the base station. In addition, they use the same network coded information for exchange of mutual information between themselves. This strategy not only increases the numbers of concurrent transmissions within the common cell but it also, using the same spectrum, offloads the base station which as a results can serve other demanding users within the cells and improve the overall efficiency of the network. We use outage probability as a performance metric to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme and show that the proposed scheme performs better then space time and repetition coding based cooperative communications.	channel use;downtime;linear network coding;mutual information;relay;repetition code;telecommunications link;tip (unix utility);wireless router	Gordhan Das Menghwar;Shazia Parveen Soomro;Zhong Ting;Zhiguang Qin	2015	2015 9th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)	10.1109/ICSPCS.2015.7391775	electronic engineering;linear network coding;telecommunications;computer science;base station identity code;computer network	Mobile	33.53910985882216	77.49682007999931	164453

The outage probability of the system is investigated using the moment generating function (MGF) of the total signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the base station. Since it is complicated to derive a closed form expression of the outage probability, we derive an approximation for the probability density function (PDF) of the total SNR which in turn enables us to derive the asymptomatic outage probability for any value of the fading parameter m. Simulation results are presented to assess the accuracy of our analytical results. Furthermore, using the derived outage probability, we investigate the diversity advantage of the cooperative system under different system settings.	anisotropic filtering;approximation;asymptote;cobham's thesis;consensus dynamics;downtime;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);modulation;multi-user;phase detector;portable document format;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sun outage	Ali Mehemed;Walaa Hamouda	2012	2012 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2012.6399064	code division multiple access;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;probability;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	37.584276614264304	78.72275831109951	165702
1127f9919b9bbff6ceb14d98deb35329d987af96	superposition coding in alternate df relaying systems with inter-relay interference cancellation		This paper considers the layered transmission between the source and the destination over two relays using super-position coding (SC). In this two-hop decode-and-forward (DF) relaying system, because of the network topology, the receiver continuously decodes only the base layer of the direct transmission from the source; the enhancement layer is decoded with a delay based on the transmission from one of the two relays sending and receiving in alternate time slots. Alternate relaying improves the spectral efficiency of the scheme, however it causes inter-relay interference (IRI), which may limit the system performance if not mitigated. To allow the proper data recovery at the relays and at the destination, we have designed successive interference cancellation decoding schemes that consider different power allocations to the base and enhancement layers. Specifically, based on the channel gains between different transmitter-receiver pairs, the transmissions from the source and the relays are aligned in time and power as to optimize the system throughput. Finally, based on the analytical derivations and simulations, we present numerical results for capacity improvements in the proposed scheme over the existing schemes.	data recovery;direction finding;interference (communication);multiplexing;network topology;numerical analysis;relay;simplified instructional computer;simulation;spectral efficiency;throughput;transmitter	Rashed Alsakarnah;Jacek Ilow	2017	2017 IEEE 13th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)	10.1109/WiMOB.2017.8115831	single antenna interference cancellation;computer network;throughput;data recovery;network topology;computer science;decoding methods;spectral efficiency;relay;communication channel	Mobile	33.31722791733501	76.7955344221206	165857

Moreover, tight lower-bound and asymptotic outage probability expressions are derived in closed-form for the evaluated systems.

This paper illustrates how system performance can improve if we allow for this flexibility. After developing a system model based upon the classical two-user, discrete-memoryless interference channel, we present two decoding schemes based upon the anywhere decoding concept, each requiring extremely low overhead to enable cooperation among the receivers. Both of these schemes offer the same achievable rate region, for which we outline the proof in the discrete-memoryless case and state the result for the Gaussian case with independent and identically distributed Gaussian inputs. When cast into a cellular setting with two cooperating basestations experiencing path-loss and multipath fading, we assess performance in terms of two system metrics: the common outage probability and the symmetric throughput. Asymptotic analysis of the outage probability of the anywhere decoding schemes demonstrates that they achieve full spatial diversity through multiple decoding opportunities, and they are no more than 1.5 decibels (dB) from full basestation cooperation at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).	decibel;decoding methods;downtime;interference (communication);multipath propagation;overhead (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;throughput;transmitter	Hamed Pezeshki;J.

In order to recover the half duplex loss of the transmission, we adopt a successive relaying (SR) strategy, coupled with reactive relay selection considering the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) of each hop, after every source transmission. The main degrading factor in this scheme is the IRI introduced by the best relay, which is selected to forward the previous frame, while the rest of the relays are receiving the current source frame. Trying to cancel the effect of IRI, we employ interference cancelation (IC) to subtract the interference signal depending on the capacity of the interference channel.	catastrophic interference;current source;downtime;duplex (telecommunications);end-to-end principle;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);modulation;numerical analysis;rayleigh fading;relay;ruby document format;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio	Nikolaos Nomikos;Demosthenes Vouyioukas	2012	2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314208	communications protocol;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;adjacent-channel interference;single antenna interference cancellation;telecommunications;computer science;zero-forcing precoding;co-channel interference;channel capacity;statistics;computer network	Mobile	33.56293685356246	77.34330609187593	166833

Both peak-power and peak-interference constraints are considered in the system. At first, the end-to-end exact and asymptotic outage probabilities of the considered system are derived. By using the derived asymptotic outage, an approximate expression for the optimum number of hops that minimize the outage probability is derived for fixed-rate and fixed-distance between the source and destination nodes. Later, the exact and asymptotic expressions are derived for end-to-end symbol-error-rate (SER) and ergodic-rate of the considered system. Numerical results are presented to validate the derived analytical expressions. It is shown by analysis that with increasing number of relaying hops between the source and destination, the SER performance improves but the ergodic-rate declines.	approximation algorithm;asymptotic equipartition property;cognitive radio;downtime;end-to-end principle;ergodicity;hoc (programming language);hop;interference (communication);numerical method;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;relay;routing	Hari Krishna Boddapati;Manav R.

Motivated by this, we investigate the asymptotic achievable sum-rate for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple-access cellular systems in the uplink employing cooperative base stations (BSs) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying. In our model, the antennas at the user equipments (UEs), relay terminals, and BSs are correlated and there are direct links between UEs and BSs. Using the replica method, we derive the large-system sum-rate for the uplink system using joint optimal decoding (JOD) as well as separate detection and decoding (SDD) and show that each UE's performance can be characterized by a vector Gaussian channel with an appropriate vector input, an effective channel gain, and a vector Gaussian noise. Based on the asymptotic result, we also devise an efficient algorithm to determine the asymptotic optimum transmit matrices for the UEs and relays that can maximize the sum-rate of the MIMO multiple-access cellular network if the spatial channel covariance information (CCI) is available and exploited at the UEs and the relay terminals.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;gene expression programming;mimo;relay;telecommunications link	Chao-Kai Wen;Kai-Kit Wong	2010	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2010.101203	gaussian noise;cellular network;covariance matrix;asymptotic analysis;telecommunications;computer science;base station;control theory;mutual information;relay channel;cooperation;statistics;spectral efficiency;mimo;technology	ML	37.83631692481985	81.25610258641696	167495

Prior works have derived closed-form SE bounds and approximations for Gaussian distributed channels, while we consider the double scattering model — a prime example of a non-Gaussian channel for which it is intractable to obtain closed form SE expressions. The channels are estimated using limited resources, which gives rise to pilot contamination, and the estimates are used for linear detection and to compute the SE numerically. Analytical and numerical examples are used to describe the key behaviors of the double scattering models, which differ from conventional Massive MIMO models. Finally, we provide multi-cell simulation results that compare the double scattering model with uncorrelated Rayleigh fading and explain under what conditions we can expect to achieve similar SEs.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation;mimo;numerical analysis;pilot ace;rayleigh fading;simulation;spectral efficiency	Trinh Van Chien;Emil Björnson;Erik G.

6b8e2f7cc63a6046b4cb85e2917d197944d8341b	relay based wireless networks with joint modulation, power allocation and relay selection		In this paper we consider performance improvement of decode and forward (DF) relays via joint modulation at relays, power allocation across the relay nodes and relay selection. Initially, we consider a canonical relay network scenario consisting of three nodes, of which two of them constitute source and sink nodes and one of them would act as a relay. The source and sink nodes cannot reach each other directly and therefore rely on the relay for data forwarding. We assume all the three nodes use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) as the physical (PHY) layer transmission mechanism. Further it is assumed that, the relay node performs joint modulation on the data received from both the nodes as described in [1] (henceforth referred to as decode and forward joint modulation (DFJM)), thus creating a broadcast frame which is then transmitted to both the nodes. The performance of this DFJM at relay is compared against the simple DF technique in which relay does not perform any processing. Our simulation results suggest that the former outperforms the latter in terms of throughput. Our simulation results also suggest that the throughput improvement with DFJM against the simple DF technique was found to be much higher in networks that are asymmetric with respect to transmission rates. Next we consider the performance of DFJM scheme with relay selection and power allocation by considering a relay based network with more than one relay in it. Our simulation results on this aspect suggest that an equal power allocation among various relays gives better throughput values as against that of the scheme where relay selection is combined with optimal power allocation. This behavior is contrary to what was observed in a related work where simple analog relays were considered [2]. The relatively better performance of the DFJM scheme with equal power allocation as against that of the scheme with relay selection followed by optimal power allocation can be attributed largely to the following: (i) less number of transmission slots that a DFJM based scheme would require and (ii) the inherent diversity advantage of having all the relays transmit.	amelioration pattern;broadcast domain;direction finding;frequency divider;modulation;multiplexing;operand forwarding;phy (chip);relay;simulation;telecommunications network;throughput	Sonal Baghel;Laxminarayana S.

As such, in the cooperative phase whereby both the source and the selected relay nodes transmit to the destination node, it is only feasible to exploit cooperative spatial diversity (for example by means of distributed space time coding). For wireless systems with a multi-antenna destination node, in the cooperative phase it is possible to opportunistically transmit multiple data streams to the destination node by utilizing multiple relay nodes. Therefore, we propose a low overhead multi-relay selection protocol to support multi-stream cooperative communications. In addition, we derive the asymptotic performance results at high SNR for the proposed scheme and discuss the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff as well as the throughput-reliability tradeoff. From these results, we show that the proposed multi-stream cooperative communication scheme achieves lower outage probability compared to existing baseline schemes.	baseline (configuration management);cooperative mimo;downtime;multiplexing;overhead (computing);relay;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput	Shunqing Zhang;Vincent K.

During transmission, our scheme combines both block Markov coding and an independent coding scheme similar to network coding at the relay. The main contribution of this work is to examine how link state impacts the allocation of power between these two distinct techniques, which in turn governs the necessity of each technique in achieving the largest transmission rate region. We analytically determine the link-state regimes and associated relaying techniques. Our results illustrate an interesting trend: when the user-to-relay link is marginally stronger than the direct link, it is optimal to use only independent coding. In this case, the relay need not use full power. However, for larger user-to-relay link gains, the relay must supplement independent coding with block Markov coding to achieve the largest rate region. These link-state regimes are important for the application of two-way relaying in 5G networks, such as in D2D mode or relay-aided transmission.	inline linking;linear network coding;link-state routing protocol;markov chain;relay channel	Lisa Pinals;Mai H.

In this paper, we propose a fixed-rate transmission scheme over a two-user X channel where each of the two double-antenna transmitters has independent messages for each of the two double-antenna receivers. Each transmitter encodes symbols using Alamouti codes followed by beamformers that align interference at unintended receivers. The receiver removes the aligned interference and decouples symbols using interference cancellation followed by symbol-by-symbol decoding. Our analysis shows that the proposed scheme achieves a diversity gain of 2 at the maximum node-to-node symbol-rate of 2 over 3.	align (company);code;coupling (computer programming);interference (communication);multiplexing;numerical analysis;transmitter	Liangbin Li;Hamid Jafarkhani;Syed Ali Jafar	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2011.6034034	single antenna interference cancellation;channel code;telecommunications;zero-forcing precoding;mathematics;co-channel interference;statistics	Arch	35.84164540997239	74.93942196099754	169787

We consider the randomness of the individual interfering signals by randomly placing transmitting terminals around each relay node and the destination. Moreover, the number of interferers per hop is not fixed but follows Poisson distribution. The derived analytical expression is verified by simulation and used to investigate system and propagation parameters such as density of interfering terminals and path-loss exponent, respectively, on the multihop system performance.	bit error rate;interference (communication);propagation constant;random number generation;randomness;rayleigh fading;relay;simulation;statistical interference;transmitter	Termpong Soithong;Valentine A.

Such characteristics are particularly useful in network connectivity analysis. The proposed approximation is exact in the limit of small first argument of the Marcum Q-function, in which case the optimal parameters can be obtained analytically. For larger values of the first argument, an optimization problem is solved, and the parameters can be accurately represented using regression analysis. Numerical results indicate that the proposed methods result in approximations very close to the actual Marcum Q-function for small and moderate values of the first argument. We demonstrate the accuracy of the approximation by using it to analyze the connectivity properties of random ad hoc networks operating in a Rician fading environment.	approximation;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;numerical linear algebra;optimization problem;time complexity	Mohammud Z.

First, we analyze a unidirectional multihop network, in which two acoustic nodes separated by two hops are assigned the same code-division channel (i.e., spreading code) to transmit concurrently. The packets transmitted by the two nodes will collide at the intermediate (relay) node. However, we show that, by exploiting a priori information, i.e., the interfered packet previously received from one of the nodes, and applying joint channel estimation through pilot supervision along with a newly designed adaptive RAKE receiver, the relay node can cancel the interference before decoding the packet of interest. We then extend our analysis to a bidirectional network, in which two nodes first concurrently transmit their packets to the relay using the same spreading code. The relay amplifies and forwards the received interfered packet to the two nodes. We show that either node can still decode the packet of interest after equalizing the channel effects introduced during the propagation from the relay to itself and jointly estimating multipath affected channels and suppressing the self-interference signal before applying the adaptive RAKE receiver. The proposed ANC-CDMA scheme is implemented in a testbed based on Teledyne Benthos Telesonar SM-975 underwater modems and tested extensively in Lake LaSalle. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that for a 1-2 dB tradeoff in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the proposed scheme can significantly improve the channel utilization of a unidirectional and bidirectional networks by up to 50% and 100%, respectively, compared with conventional multiuser DS-CDMA scheme.	acoustic cryptanalysis;bi-directional text;bidirectional associative memory;channel state information;experiment;interference (communication);internet relay chat;linear network coding;modem;multi-user;multipath propagation;network packet;rake;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;testbed;throughput;x.690	Hovannes Kulhandjian;Tommaso Melodia;Dimitrios Koutsonikolas	2015	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2456012	telecommunications;computer science;relay channel;fading;wireless;computer network	Mobile	33.34684422459902	76.56761536247681	170785

This is even more challenging with multihop networks, in which transmission outage occurs when one single device along the relay path cannot harvest enough energy. A virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) model for multihop, multipath networks has recently been developed to facilitate reliable open-loop end-to-end transmissions, making networks robust to random transmission outages without the necessity of bandwidth-consuming and complicated end-to-end feedback and control. In this paper, a framework based on a virtual MIMO model of multihop, multipath opportunistic networks formed by energy-harvesting devices is developed. We propose rotated-algebraic path-time codes (RA-PTC), by which data are encoded using Givens rotation and cyclic division algebras. Without rate loss, a form of time diversity is exploited by repeatedly transmitting the RA-PTC-coded data. Extensive theoretical analyses are carried out using amount of fading and diversity as metrics. Both the performance enhancement due to the proposed RA-PTC and the performance loss due to energy shortage are quantified. Furthermore, a simple yet effective cyclic power control is proposed to improve transmission reliability. Numerical results demonstrate that RA-PTC and cyclic power control enable efficient and reliable end-to-end transmission in multipath, multihop opportunistic networks formed by energy-harvesting devices.	code;downtime;end-to-end principle;givens rotation;linear algebra;mimo;multipath propagation;relay;traffic collision avoidance system;transmitter	I-Wei Lai;Chia-han Lee;Kwang-Cheng Chen;Ezio Biglieri	2016	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2574858	3g mimo;electronic engineering;telecommunications;power control;engineering;reliability;mathematics;spread spectrum;energy harvesting;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	33.717463858476314	80.67008718072937	170970

Results are derived for both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocols. For the AF protocol, we derive accurate approximations for the system outage probability when the relays are clustered between the source and destination. For the case where all the relays are clustered near the destination, an exact closed-form expression for the system outage probability is obtained. For the DF protocol, under general multiple relaying configurations, we derive an exact closed-form expression for the system outage probability. The outage results for AF and DF are used subsequently to yield expressions for the finite-SNR DMT. We also extract the conventional asymptotic DMTs as special cases of the finite-SNR results, and demonstrate that the asymptotic DMTs can significantly overestimate the level of diversity that is achievable for practical error rates and SNRs.	anisotropic filtering;approximation;digital monetary trust;direction finding;downtime;fibre channel point-to-point;hop;multiplexing;relay;signal-to-noise ratio	Ying Liu;K.

A secondary network can reuse the spectrum of a primary network under the condition that the primary services are not harmfully interrupted. In this paper, we study the distribution of the interference power at a primary receiver when the interfering secondary terminals are distributed in a Poisson field. We assume that a secondary terminal is able to cease its transmission if it is within a distance of R to the primary receiver. We derive a general formula for the characteristic function of the random interference generated by such a secondary network. With this general formula we investigate the impacts of R, shadowing, and small scale fading on the probability density function (PDF) of the interference power. We find that when there is no interference region (R = 0), the interference PDFs follow heavy-tailed alpha-stable distributions. In case that a proper interference region is defined by a positive value of R, the tails of the interference power PDFs can be significantly shortened. Moreover, the impacts of shadowing and small scale fading on the interference PDFs are studied and the small scale fading is found to be beneficial in terms of reducing the mean value and outage probability of the interference power.	catastrophic interference;characteristic function (convex analysis);cognition;cognitive network;cognitive radio;downtime;interference (communication);interrupt;numerical method;portable document format;quadratic formula;tails	Xuemin Hong;Cheng-Xiang Wang;John S.

Based on linear congruence sequences, one can show that, for any finite subset of these sequences, with the total proportional rate not exceeding a specific threshold, there cannot be enough collisions to completely block any particular sequence, no matter how they are shifted with respect to one another. This property can be exploited in certain applications, such as wireless sensor and ad hoc networks. A further investigation into how to enhance the allowable rate sum is conducted.

We propose a spatially adaptive random access (SARA) scheme in which the transmitters in the network utilize different transmit probabilities depending on the local situation. In our proposed scheme, the transmit probability is adaptively updated by the ratio of the received SINR and the target SINR. We investigate the performance of the SARA scheme. For comparison, we derive an optimal transmit probability of ALOHA scheme in which all transmitters use the same transmit probability. We illustrate the performance of the SARA scheme through simulations. We show that the performance of the proposed scheme surpasses that of the optimal ALOHA scheme and is comparable with the CSMA/CA scheme.	interference (communication);random access;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;transmitter	Dong-Min Kim;Seong-Lyun Kim	2015	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2419633	signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;transmitter;convergence;telecommunications;computer science;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;random access;wireless;computer network	Mobile	34.087708584610446	79.67363540357226	174608

Effective capacity (EC) is a valuable quantity which helps analysing delay QoS performance as the most popular QoS metric. In this study, the authors concentrate on characterising the delay QoS performance via the EC of uplink transmission mode of individual users in multiuser centralised networks in which the user’s transmitted signals may interfere with each other. To reduce the computational complexity of finding EC, the authors first propose closed form expressions for the EC of each user, with or without considering the inter-symbol interference (ISI). Then, two general algorithms are presented to clarify the relation of EC and QoS guarantee performance of a system in which the way of analysing QoS guarantee performance is explained step-by-step. By the use of these algorithms and the obtained closed form EC functions, the authors investigate the statistical delay QoS performance of individual users and the effects of channel conditions and ISI on their performance. The numerical results validate our analytical outcomes in deriving closed form equations and evaluate the offered schemes in characterising delay QoS performance.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;centralisation;computational complexity theory;information sciences institute;interference (communication);multi-user;numerical analysis;provisioning;quality of service;telecommunications link	Sara Efazati;Paeiz Azmi	2015	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2014.0344	real-time computing;telecommunications;numerical analysis;computer science;computational complexity theory;intersymbol interference;computer network	Metrics	36.87730596459274	81.01315860006339	174721

QSM is a new MIMO technique proposed to enhance the performance of conventional spatial modulation (SM) while retaining almost all its inherent advantages. Furthermore, mmWave utilizes a license-free wide-bandwidth spectrum and is a very promising candidate for future wireless systems. Detailed and novel analysis of the mutual information and the achievable capacity for mmWave-QSM system are presented in this study. The conditions under which theoretical capacity can be achieved are derived and discussed. Monte Carlo simulation results are provided to corroborate derived formulas. It is shown that significant performance enhancements can be achieved under different system and channel configurations.	line-of-sight (missile);mimo;modulation;monte carlo method;mutual information;simulation	Raed Mesleh;Abdelhamid Younis	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)	10.1109/ISSPIT.2016.7886018	constellation diagram;telecommunications;mathematics;mutual information;statistics;mimo	Arch	38.79405863024361	80.18388257124533	175043

We derive a new expression for the symbol error rate in this proposed multi-hop detect-and-forward network by modeling the transmission line as a Markov Chain. The derived expression is quite general with respect to the (de) modulation scheme and the channel model. We compare the error rate performance of the proposed multi-hop detect-and-forward scheme with the earlier in the literature proposed multi-hop amplify and forward scheme.

1e1877a88ec23356505feb5447ff220ed516aba8	throughput characterization for cooperative wireless information transmission with rf energy harvesting-based relay		The simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in a cooperative relaying system is investigated, where the relay node is self-sustained by harvesting radiofrequency (RF) energy from the source node. In this paper, we propose a time switching and power splitting (TSPS) protocol for the cooperative system with a mobile destination node. In the first part of the transmission slot, a portion of the received signal power is used for energy transfer, and the remaining power is used for information transmission from the source to the relay. For the remaining time of the transmission slot, information is transmitted from the relay to a mobile destination node. To coordinate the wireless information and power transfer, two transmission modes are investigated, namely, relay-assisted transmission mode and nonrelay mode, respectively. Under these two modes, the outage probability and the network throughput are characterized. By joint optimization of the power splitting and the time switching ratios, we further compare the network throughput under the two transmission modes with different parameters. Results indicate that the relay-assisted transmission mode significantly improves the throughput of the wireless network.	relay;throughput	Yuanyuan Yao;Changchuan Yin;Sai Huang	2016	Mobile Information Systems	10.1155/2016/8907267	telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	33.68225742349551	81.4277792110784	175862

This composite multi-path/shadowing model has been shown to provide a remarkably accurate fading characterisation while leading to closed-form expressions for important channel statistics. Rapidly convergent infinite series representations are firstly derived for the average probability of detection and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the no-diversity reception case. These results are then extended to the case of maximal ratio, equal gain and selection diversity. To this end, novel analytical expressions for the statistics of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio of equal gain and selection diversity receivers, operating over Gamma-shadowed Rician fading channels are derived. Analytical results are substantiated by Monte Carlo simulation, as well as by extensive numerically evaluated results.	end-to-end principle;line-of-sight (missile);maximal set;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;receiver operating characteristic;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Kostas P.

Of major concern for such networks is a proper allocation of resources to each terminal so as to maximise end-to-end throughput. In contrast to ergodic channels, the optimum end-to-end throughput over non-ergodic channels is dominated by a fairly intricate relation between desired rates and associated outage probabilities. The contribution of this paper is the derivation of explicit near-optimum resource allocation strategies, the precision and performance of which is also analysed.	approximation;downtime;end-to-end principle;ergodicity;mimo;mathematical optimization;rayleigh fading;telecommunications network;throughput	Mischa Dohler;Athanasios Gkelias;Hamid Aghvami	2004	2004 IEEE 59th Vehicular Technology Conference.

Two types of two-phased transmission/reception protocols are employed to establish orthogonal transmission/reception of the relay node. The achievable rate results are provided for different combinations of modulation orders and the number of antennas used at the source and relay nodes. Quantitative results provided in this paper could serve as a guide on when to engage cooperative transmission and how to choose proper constellations and puncturing ratios for the practical BICM coded systems. Comparison of the considered BICM system with other possible cooperative coded systems is also crucial that this paper due to lack of space for exposition misses to address.	channel (communications);cooperative mimo;modulation;puncturing;relay	Reza Hoshyar;Rahim Tafazolli	2008	2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699628	cooperative;communications protocol;higher-order logic;telecommunications;computer science;antenna;coding;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;fading;statistics;mimo;modulation	Embedded	35.428579858750496	76.26234602829223	176457

The proposed system consists of a fluid medium, information molecules, a transmitter, and a receiver. We simulate the system with a one-shot signal to obtain the channel's finite impulse response. We then incorporate this result within our mathematical analysis to determine interference. Molecular communication has a great need for low complexity, hence, the receiver may have incomplete information regarding the system and the channel state. Thus, for the cases of limited information set at the receiver, we propose three detection algorithms, namely adaptive thresholding, practical zero forcing, and Genie-aided zero forcing.	algorithm;finite impulse response;genie;interference (communication);mimo;profiling (computer programming);radio frequency;simulation;testbed;thresholding (image processing);throughput;transmitter;x.690	Bonhong Koo;Huseyin Birkan Yilmaz;Chan-Byoung Chae;Andrew W.

81e08a80cedf03661bbffee1556ec14a1afc30f5	a new network coding scheme in two-relay ofdma networks		In orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) networks, relay nodes utilize network coding for the received information to improve spectrum efficiency. However, network coding spreads may result in some errors. These bit errors along the relay’s transmission, which results in high BER in receivers. To solve the error spread problem, we propose a new coding algorithm called dualism network coding (DNC) algorithm to cripple the spread of error effectively for 2-relay networks. In the proposed algorithm, relay node reuse the bit decoded from the received information for the network coding of next slot. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is effective to solve the problem of error propagation effectively.	linear network coding;relay	Hui Zhao;Yueyun Chen;Xiaopan Yuan	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-47401-3_38	linear network coding	Theory	33.15456608627787	76.29790647587143	176998

For a 2- hop relay system with one relay node, we derive a closed-form power allocation solution and based on it we propose a relay active condition. If and only if the fading channel coefficients satisfy this condition, the relay transmits the signals to the destination; otherwise, the relay will stay in an idle state. For a system with more than one relay nodes, general closed-form power allocation solutions based on the extact SNR expression are not tractable, so we calculate a SNR upper bound and derive a sub-optimum power allocation solution based on this bound. The simulation results show that for a 2-hop relay channel, the proposed adaptive power allocation (APA) scheme can bring the system a considerable SNR gains compared to the equal power allocation scheme.

We use the generalized Lloyd algorithm (GLA) to design the quantizer of the feedback information and specifically to optimize the bit error rate (BER) performance of the system. Achievable bounds for different performance measures are derived. First, we analytically show that a simple feedback scheme based on relay selection can achieve full diversity. Unlike the previous diversity analysis on the relay selection scheme, our analysis is not aided by any approximations or modified forwarding schemes. Then, for highrate feedback, we find an upper bound on the average signalto- noise ratio (SNR) loss. Using this result, we demonstrate that both the average SNR loss and the capacity loss decay at least exponentially with the number of feedback bits. In addition, we provide approximate upper and lower bounds on the BER, which can be calculated numerically.We observe that our designs can achieve both full diversity as well as high array gain with only a moderate number of feedback bits. Simulations also show that our approximate BER is a reliable estimation on the actual BER. We also generalize our analytical results to asynchronous networks, where perfect carrier level synchronization is not available among the relays.	anisotropic filtering;approximation algorithm;beamforming;bit error rate;capacity loss;feedback;linde–buzo–gray algorithm;numerical analysis;quantization (signal processing);relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;x.690	Erdem Koyuncu;Yindi Jing;Hamid Jafarkhani	2008	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2008.081009	computer simulation;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;beamforming	Metrics	37.084362644210415	75.9914411736599	177721

We consider a more practical scenario in which multiple users, multiple relays and a single destination are involved in the two-way network. In this paper, the code division multiple access (CDMA) system with non-orthogonal spreading sequences is employed to handle the multiuser interference. Relay selection based on maximizing the SINR of the worse link is proposed in this research. Besides, aiming at mitigating the interference, we consider the design of linear filter at each relay such that the minimum SINR of the worst link in the two-way transmission is maximized. The result shows that the linear filter is similar to minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detector. Furthermore, we simulate the proposed scheme with several different parameters such as the numbers of users and relays, and the length of spreading sequences. Also, we compare the proposed RS method with random RS approach, and the result shows that our proposed method has better performance in terms of the bit error rate (BER).	bit error rate;interference (communication);multi-user mimo;reed–solomon error correction;relay;shortest path problem;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;x.690	Yi-Ju Liao;Feng-Tsun Chien;Min-Kuan Chang	2012	Proceedings of The 2012 Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference		electronic engineering;telecommunications;communication	Embedded	37.59242092570937	79.69982709624628	178699

Thus, a conclusion can be made as to which end contributes more to capacity reduction. In general, the higher correlated end has a dominant effect on the capacity.	channel capacity;ergodicity;mimo;the matrix	Sergey Loyka;Ammar B.

We use a stochastic geometric framework to model distance depended inter cell interference. Using this framework, we analyze the coverage and rate using two linear receivers, namely, partial zero-forcing (PZF) and minimum-mean-square-estimation (MMSE) receivers. Analytical expressions are obtained for coverage and rate distribution that are suitable for fast numerical computation. In the case of the PZF receiver, we show that it is not optimal to utilize all the receive antenna for canceling interference. With α as the path loss exponent, Nt transmit antenna, Nr receive antenna, we show that Nt ⌈(1-2/α) (Nr/Nt-1/2)⌉ receive antennas for interference cancellation and the remaining antennas for signal enhancement (array gain). For both PZF and MMSE receivers, we observe that increasing the number of data streams provides an improvement in the mean data rate with diminishing returns. Also transmitting Nr streams is not optimal in terms of the mean sum rate. We observe that increasing the SM rate with a PZF receiver always degrades the cell edge data rate while the performance with MMSE receiver is nearly independent of the SM rate.	computation;data rate units;interference (communication);mean squared error;multi-user;numerical analysis;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;spatial multiplexing;transmitter;uncompressed video;zero-forcing precoding	Sreejith T.

A simple approximated expression for the average PER at the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region is further proposed. Based on the approximation, the optimal power allocation (OPA) scheme for CC-HARQ is studied. The closed-form optimal assignment solution at the high SNR is derived to minimize the average total power consumption under packet loss rate (PLR) and maximum number of transmission rounds constraints. Furthermore, the impact of transmission parameters on the OPA scheme is investigated. It is found that the ratios among the optimal power sequence just depend on the targeted PLR and the maximum number of transmission rounds.	approximation algorithm;bit error rate;hybrid automatic repeat request;network packet;opa;private label rights;propagation constant;public lending right;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio	Songhu Ge;Yong Xi;Shengchun Huang;Jibo Wei	2014	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2332168	telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	33.942247169601416	79.26460846262114	180795

Through the use of MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) technology, the physical layer is able to superimpose multiple concurrent information flows, thereby increasing the communications parallelism in the network. We propose a cooperative cross-layer scheme that integrates distributed incremental redundancy hybrid automatic retransmission request (HARQ) error control with routing in order to increase the efficiency of the transmissions and decrease the interference load in the network. In the proposed scheme, next hop relays are opportunistically selected during the HARQ process in order to avoid overloaded receivers and guarantee the geographical advancement of the packets. Thus, cooperation is used to both strengthen weak links and select the path to the destination. Numerical results are presented for a specific instantiation where a layered space-time multiuser detection (LASTMUD) transmitter-receiver architecture with spread-spectrum signals is implemented at the physical layer and packets are encoded with a linear erasure code (LEC).	algorithm;blast;erasure code;error detection and correction;hoc (programming language);hybrid automatic repeat request;interference (communication);mimo;multi-user;network packet;network performance;numerical analysis;parallel computing;relay;retransmission (data networks);routing;transmitter;universal instantiation	Marco Levorato;Federico Librino;Michele Zorzi	2011	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2011.061311.090705	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;packet forwarding;spread spectrum;statistics;computer network	Mobile	33.42492729287478	76.81159151105558	181172

The first scenario is the multiple access relay channel where a single relay is dedicated to simultaneously help two multiple access users. For this setup, it is shown that the ARQ-DDF protocol achieves the channel's optimal diversity multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). The second scenario is the cooperative vector multiple access channel where two users cooperate in delivering their messages to a destination equipped with two receiving antennas. For this setup, a new variant of the ARQ-DDF protocol is developed where the two users are purposefully instructed not to cooperate in the first round of transmission. Lower and upper bounds on the achievable DMT are then derived. These bounds are shown to converge to the optimal tradeoff as the number of transmission rounds increases.	automatic repeat request;converge;digital monetary trust;disk data format;distribution frame;multiplexing;relay channel	Kambiz Azarian;Hesham El Gamal;Philip Schniter	2008	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2008.917722	telecommunications;information theory;computer science;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;statistics;computer network	Mobile	36.55321232404578	74.56039323330806	181784
75d3a6b723098e41c2cfaf681b37c718f189472e	buffer-aided physical-layer network coding with optimal linear code designs for cooperative networks		In this paper, we propose buffer-aided physical-layer network coding (PLNC) techniques for improving data transmission over cooperative networks. In particular, we develop buffer-aided PLNC schemes and relay pair selection algorithms for direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems. We devise PLNC techniques based on optimal linear network coding matrices according to the maximum likelihood and minimum mean-square error design criteria in order to generate the network coded symbols that are sent to the destination. In the proposed buffer-aided PLNC schemes, relay pair selection algorithms are developed to obtain the relay pair and the packets in the buffer entries with the best performance and the associated link combinations are used for the data transmission. An analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed techniques along with their sum-rate analysis is carried out. Simulation results show that the proposed techniques significantly outperform previously reported approaches.	autocorrelation;brute-force search;coefficient;computational complexity theory;consensus dynamics;cross-correlation;data compression;exclusive or;gradient;greedy algorithm;linear code;linear network coding;loss function;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;optimization problem;procedural generation;relay;simulation;xojo	Jiaqi Gu;R.

Specifically, they show that opportunistic relaying (OR) is an optimal solution in terms of instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), that is, it provides the maximum instantaneous SNR under the constraint of fixed transmit power for the relays. In particular, instead of allocating the given transmit power to all relays, letting the best relay transmit with this power is an optimal solution for maximising the received SNR. To exhibit this benefit, Monte Carlo simulations are presented showing superior performance of the OR scheme compared to equal power allocation policy for the considered relay networks. For the considered optimal scenario, the authors further derive analytical expressions for the outage probability and symbol error rate (SER) over quasi-static independent, not necessarily identically distributed Nakagami-m fading channels. They further present asymptotically tight approximations for the outage probability and SER in the high SNR regime, rendering insights into the cooperative diversity behaviour. Finally, numerical results are provided to examine the effect of network parameters on the system performance of the considered network.	ampersand;approximation;channel state information;discrete cosine transform;downtime;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sun outage	Hoc Phan;Trung Quang Duong;Hans-Jürgen Zepernick;Theodoros A.

In this context, the root-mean-square power of a Nakagami-m signal is assumed to be subject to variations induced by an inverse Nakagamim random variable. Comparisons with physical channel data demonstrate that the proposed composite fading model provides as good, and in most cases better, fit to the data compared to the generalized-K composite fading model. Motivated by this result, simple novel expressions are derived for the key statistical metrics and performance measures of interest.	chi-squared target models;cobham's thesis;computation;emoticon;fisher information;kasparov's gambit;multipath propagation;portable document format	Seong Ki Yoo;Simon L.

Simple closed-form expressions for the outage and bit error probabilities of these systems are derived. The analysis is valid for an arbitrary number of hops, arbitrary number of branches and any fading channel model whose signal power probability density function has nonzero value at the origin. It is shown that while a multi-hop transmission system does not offer diversity gain, it can perform better than a single hop system if its average individual link SNRs satisfy a certain condition. In addition, the analysis clearly shows the diversity gains achieved by multi-branch systems for any fading channel model.	bit error rate;channel (communications);downtime;emoticon;gradient;jensen's inequality;modulus of continuity;portable document format;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;social inequality;sun outage	Golnaz Farhadi;Norman C.

When multiple antennas can not be used in mobile units, user cooperation can be employed to provide transmit diversity. In this paper, we analyze the error performance of coded cooperative diversity with multiple cooperating users over Nakagami fading channels under interference conditions. We derive the end-to-end bit error probability of coded cooperation (averaged over all cooperation scenarios). Results show that allowing more cooperating users improves the performance of the network under low loads, where two cooperating users suffice for highly loaded networks. Furthermore, the gains obtained by increasing the number of cooperating users decreases with increasing the network load.	bit error rate;end-to-end principle;interference (communication)	Salam A.

By broadcasting the network coded frames through the shared sub-carriers, with specific network coding and frame recovery at each relay node (RN), the proposed algorithm provides 1/3 higher spectral efficiency than the conventional, store-and-forward, relaying scheme. The proposed algorithm suffers from the error propagations in the data recovery at the destinations. To control this effect, re-initialization into the transmission scheme is proposed.	algorithm;broadcast delay;data recovery;end-to-end principle;linear network coding;propagation of uncertainty;relay;software propagation;spectral efficiency;store and forward;x.690	Hanhua Zhao;Jacek Ilow	2010	2010 8th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference	10.1109/CNSR.2010.57	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	32.94892983768504	76.41525777713541	183386

The analysis can be also extended to other types of cooperative strategies and multi-hop networks without much difficulty. The proposed moment generating function (MGF) framework is also sufficiently general to encapsulate all types of coherent and non-coherent digital modulation schemes. In addition to simplifying the computation complexity of average symbol error rate (ASER) for cooperative amplify-and-forward (CAF) diversity schemes treated in the literature, we also provide accurate ASER approximations for many fading environments that heretofore had resisted a simple solution. The accuracy of our approximations has been validated with closed-form formulas that are available for specific fading environments (e.g., Rayleigh and Nakagami-m channels) and via computer (Monte Carlo) simulations.	approximation;coherence (physics);computation;modulation;monte carlo method;rayleigh–ritz method;relay;sap composite application framework;simulation	Annamalai Annamalai;Oluwatobi Olabiyi;Shumon Alam	2011	2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference	10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982667	asymptotic analysis;telecommunications;probability;cooperative diversity;fading;statistics	Visualization	37.88332464002704	77.95968974560614	183759

Since two users share both time and frequency resource in cooperation sub-frame, the proposed scheme is more bandwidth efficient. We characterize performance of the proposed scheme in symmetric interuser case. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the amplify-to-forward cooperative system. Compared to the distributed space-time coding with time-division multiple accesses cooperative system, the proposed scheme achieves the same diversity gain but loses some coding gain. However, when the selection relay protocol is adopted for the proposed scheme, coding gain is also achieved.	apache axis;coding gain;consensus dynamics;in-phase and quadrature components;modulation;multiplexing;relay;simulation	Rong Ran;Dong Ku Kim	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74784-0_21	space–time block code;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;coding gain;distributed computing;cooperative diversity;time division multiple access;computer network	Mobile	35.01560083704756	76.57567862582967	184077

While previous work has focused on development of novel K-factor estimators, the practical matter of determining the minimum number of samples N (or minimum sample duration T) required to estimate K to within a specified confidence interval sigmaK has not received much attention. Here, for the case of a simple moment-based K-factor estimator, we use Monte Carlo simulations to show how N and T depend upon the value of K, the confidence interval sigmaK, the correlation between successive samples, and the sampling interval DeltaT. The results will be useful to those who use such an estimator in practical systems for the purposes of channel state estimation and/or radio resource management.	k-factor (cisco);line-of-sight (missile);monte carlo method;radio resource management;sampling (signal processing);simulation;stationary process	Anthony E.-L.

This correlation impacts the diversity achievable with multiple transmissions over a link. In this paper, we focus on a link in a Poisson field of interferers and show that there is no diversity gain in using retransmissions, even with independent Rayleigh fading on all channels, in stark contrast to what the diversity would be if interference was independent from time slot to time slot. To show this, we first derive the joint success probability of n transmissions in closed-form, which is based on the so-called diversity polynomial, which captures the degree of dependence of the transmission success events. The main conclusion is that ignoring interference correlation can lead to significant errors in the network performance evaluation.	approximation;interference (communication);network performance;performance evaluation;polynomial;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;retransmission (data networks);signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Martin Haenggi	2013	MILCOM 2013 - 2013 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2013.126	electronic engineering;antenna diversity;telecommunications;diversity scheme;mathematics;cooperative diversity;statistics;diversity gain	Mobile	36.222044691840765	78.28989430564957	184604

Contrary to the established belief that block Markov coding is always the rate-optimal DF strategy, under certain channel conditions (a link regime), independent signaling between the source and relay achieves the same transmission rate without requiring coherent channel phase information. Furthermore, this independent signaling regime allows the relay to conserve power. As such, we design a composite DF relaying strategy that achieves the same rate as block Markov DF but with less required relay power. The finding is attractive from the link adaptation perspective to adapt relay coding and relay power according to the link state. We examine this link adaptation in fading under both perfect channel state information (CSI) and practical CSI in which nodes have perfect receive and long-term transmit CSI, and derive the corresponding relay power savings in both cases. We also derive the outage probability of the composite relaying scheme, which adapts the signaling to the link regime. Through simulation, we expose a tradeoff for relay placement showing that the relay conserves the most power when closer to the destination but achieves the most rate gain when closer to the source.	channel state information;coherence (physics);direction finding;downtime;link-state routing protocol;markov chain;relay channel;simulation	Lisa Pinals;Ahmad Abu Al Haija;Mai H.

The mixed RF/FSO/RF system finds application where the FSO link can be used to provide high speed optical connectivity between two RF networks. The RF links are characterized by independent but not identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) Nakagami-m fading links and the FSO link is characterized by path loss, Double Generalized Gamma (DGG) distributed turbulence, and pointing errors. For this mixed triplehop communication system, novel analytical expressions are derived for the key performance metric, i.e., the average bit error rate for various modulation techniques. Numerical results show the effect of fading parameters and pointing errors on the performance of the considered cooperative system.	bit error rate;consensus dynamics;direction finding;modulation;numerical linear algebra;profiling (computer programming);radio frequency;relay;turbulence;x.690	Sanya Anees;Manav R.

In this paper, we develop this approach for different case studies. In particular, we verify our proposed algorithms for different size of antennas. Further, as a case study for the relevance of the Kronecker assumption, numerical analysis will be carried out to evaluate the performance of optimal pilot design for Kronecker and non-Kronecker MIMO channels.	algorithm;etsi satellite digital radio;linear programming relaxation;mimo;numerical analysis;relevance;semiconductor industry;stationary process;transceiver	Nafiseh Shariati;Mats Bengtsson	2011	2011 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2011.6096959	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics	Metrics	38.72541557486022	80.67575815536175	185694

Specifically, we derive a novel unified expression for the average bit error rate for all coherent modulation schemes assuming independent and identically distributed generalized-K fading channels, which accounts for both multipath fading and shadowing, and modeled via the Nakagami-m distribution and the gamma distributions, respectively. The noise model in the network is assumed to be an Additive White Generalized Gaussian Noise (AWGGN), which encompasses the Laplacian and the Gaussian noise environments as special cases. The derived expression obviates the need to recalculate the diversity of various receivers for many fading and noise models in a piecemeal fashion. Published results from the literature as well as numerical integration methods corroborate the accuracy of the unified expression.	additive model;additive white gaussian noise;bit error rate;code;coherence (physics);mimo;modulation;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;numerical integration;profiling (computer programming)	Ehab Salahat;Hani H.

The source encodes each packet into L similar sequences and transmits them to the destination in the L subsequent time slots. The destination combines the L sequences using maximal ratio combining and tries to decode the information. In case of decoding failure, the destination feeds back a negative acknowledgment and then the source sends the same L sequences to the destination. This process continues until successful decoding occurs at the destination with no limit on the number of retransmissions. We consider two optimization problems. In the first problem, we maximize the spectral efficiency of the system with respect to the rate for a fixed power. In the second problem, we maximize the energy efficiency with respect to the transmitted power for a fixed rate.	acknowledgment index;approximation;automatic repeat request;downtime;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;mathematical optimization;maximal set;network packet;numerical analysis;optimization problem;spectral efficiency	Amir Hadjtaieb;Ali Chelli;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2015	2015 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2015.7289240	hybrid automatic repeat request;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;efficient energy use;go-back-n arq;statistics;spectral efficiency	Mobile	33.80287938199032	79.26041677118596	186307

Numerical results for a Gaussian channel show that the new coding schemes outperform variants of compress-forward relaying and offer a good trade-off between achievable rates and complexity and decoding delay.

Analytically, it is proven to achieve the outage capacity to within 1 bit and within 50% for any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Empirically, it is shown to be nearly optimal for some fading scenarios.	1-bit architecture;direction finding;downtime;mathematical optimization;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications network	Chi Wan Sung;Mingjun Dai;Ping Hu	2011	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2011.2163327	electronic engineering;telecommunications;diamond-like carbon;engineering;electrical engineering;probability;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	Mobile	34.522778204086464	76.1375104481257	186899

This is because it offers higher spectral efficiency (SE) compared to multi-relay scheme and one-way relay cooperative systems. The SRS problem for two-way relays is not much studied in compare to one-way relay networks, and only few researches have been carried out. In all proposed problems in SRS scheme, researchers have ignored collisions in SRS scheme, and only considered an ideal system. In this paper, we investigate SE of the SRS based on distributed method which has not adequately addressed for two-way relay. Moreover, we investigate the effects of collision on SE, by considering an amplifier and forward network in a two-way cooperative system. Our numerical and simulation results show that in a small two-way relay system, the time selection period is the main factor in the system performance. However, in a large system, the probability of collision is the main consideration in designing a two-way relay system with high spectral efficiency.	amplifier;anisotropic filtering;consensus dynamics;numerical analysis;one-way function;profiling (computer programming);reduction (complexity);relay;simulation;spectral efficiency	Tarla Abadi;Khairi Ashour Hamdi	2014	2014 IEEE 80th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2014-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2014.6966112	communications protocol;probability density function;telecommunications;computer science;probability;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless;statistics;spectral efficiency;computer network	HPC	35.66061631910475	79.25423712987612	187899

It was proved that this scheme achieves the maximum diversity R when the total transmit power is infinitely large, where R is the number of relays in the network. This paper is on the design of practical distributed space-time codes for wireless relay networks. We use orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal designs which are originally used in the design of space-time codes for multiple-antenna systems. It is well known that orthogonal space- time codes have full diversity and linear decoding complexity. They are particularly suitable for transmissions in the network setting using distributed space-time coding since their 'scale-free' property leads to good performance. Our simulations show that they achieve lower error rates than the random code. We also compare the performance of distributed space-time coding to that of selection decode-and-forward using the same orthogonal designs. Simulations show that distributed space-time coding achieves higher diversity than selection decode-and-forward when there are more than one relay node.	relay	Yindi Jing;Hamid Jafarkhani	2006		10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.129	principle of orthogonal design;telecommunications;word error rate;computer science;cooperative diversity;space–time code;statistics;computer network	Mobile	35.34339739762218	75.84668971888453	188462

The secondary user nodes can harvest energy from the primary user transmissions, and then access and utilize the primary network spectrum for information transmission. The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and achievable sum rate are derived for two specific antenna configurations: 1) unlimited base-station antenna arrays and 2) limited base-station antenna arrays. Furthermore, the optimal time-switching factor and the energy-rate trade-off are quantified in closed-form. The asymptotic analysis reveals that the secondary system can be operated by using its maximum harvested energy when the number of primary base-station antennas grows without bound without hindering the primary transmission.	cognitive radio;interference (communication);mimo;multi-user;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Hayder Al-Hraishawi;Gayan Amarasuriya	2017	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2016.2641962	3g mimo;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;computer science;antenna noise temperature;mathematics;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;energy harvesting;wireless;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	36.589669186586725	81.4752428725179	188507

Although it is doubtless a promising technique for enhancing channel reliability, its performance in terms of average source distortion is not clear since source-channel separation theorem fails under the most common nonergodic slow-fading channel assumption, when channel state information (CSI) is only available at the receiving terminals. This work sheds some light on the end-to-end performance of joint source-channel coding for cooperative relay systems in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Considering distortion exponent as a figure of merit, we propose various strategies for cooperative source and channel coding that significantly improve the performance compared to the conventional scheme of source coding followed by cooperative channel coding. We characterize the optimal distortion exponent of a full-duplex relay channel for all bandwidth ratios. For the half-duplex relay channel, we provide an upper bound which is tight for small and large bandwidth ratios. We consider the effect of correlated side information on the distortion exponent as well.	bandwidth expansion;bandwidth management;channel capacity;channel state information;consensus dynamics;data compression;distortion;duplex (telecommunications);end-to-end principle;ergodicity;forward error correction;gabbay's separation theorem;multi-user mimo;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;time complexity	Deniz Gündüz;Elza Erkip	2005	IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.	10.1109/TIT.2007.904963	binary erasure channel;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;relay channel;error exponent;fading;channel capacity;statistics;source code	Mobile	37.56430065394029	74.574646547655	188786

A similar problem was studied in [2] which considered an idealized system with the Shannon capacity. They showed that it may not be optimal for a relay node to encode all possible native packets and there exists the optimal subset of native packets that depends on the channel condition at the receiver node of each native packet. In this paper, we consider a more realistic model than that of [2] with a practical modulation scheme such as M-PSK. We show that the optimal policy is to encode native as many native packets as possible in the network coding group into a coded packet regardless of the channel condition at the receiver node for each native packet, which is a different conclusion from that of [2]. However, we show that adaptive modulation, in which the constellation size of a coded packet is adjusted based on the channel condition of each receiver node, provides a higher throughput than fixed modulation, in which its constellation size is always fixed regardless of the channel condition at each receiver node. key words: network coding, wireless ad-hoc networks, opportunistic scheduling, adaptive modulation	adaptive grammar;channel capacity;encode;exclusive or;hoc (programming language);linear network coding;modulation;network packet;pre-shared key;relay;scheduling (computing);shannon capacity of a graph;tls-psk;throughput	Seong-Lyong Gong;Byung-Gook Kim;Jang-Won Lee	2009	IEICE Transactions		wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	33.23679856476743	77.98686839138222	188865

The multicast capacity of an ad-hoc wireless network decreases with an increasing number of transmitting and/or receiving nodes within a fixed area. Digital Network Coding (DNC) has been shown to improve the multicast capacity of non-interfering wireless network. However recently proposed Physical-layer Network Coding (PNC) and Analog Network Coding (ANC) has shown that it is possible to decode an unknown packet from the collision of two packet, when one of the colliding packet is known a priori. Taking advantage of such collision decoding scheme, in this paper we propose a Joint Network Coding based Cooperative Retransmission (JNC-CR) scheme, where we show that ANC along with DNC can offer a much higher retransmission gain than that attainable through either ANC, DNC or Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) based retransmission. This scheme can be applied for two wireless multicast groups interfering with each other. Because of the broadcast nature of the wireless transmission, receivers of different multicast group can opportunistically listen and cache packets from the interfering transmitter.

Assuming Channel State Information (CSI) is available at the Receiver (CSIR), we propose a channel-dependent power-controlled Reverse Channel Training (RCT) scheme that enables the transmitter to directly estimate the power control parameter to be used for the forward-link data transmission. We show that, with an RCT power of P̅<sup>γ</sup>, γ >; 0 and a forward data transmission power of P̅, our proposed scheme achieves an infinite diversity order for 0 ≤ gm <; L<sub>c</sub> - L<sub>B,τ</sub>/L<sub>c</sub> min(γ,1) and r >; 2, where g<sub>m</sub> is the multiplexing gain, L<sub>c</sub> is the channel coherence time, L<sub>B,τ</sub> is the RCT duration and r is the number of receive antennas.

Thus, the proposed scheme achieves a significantly better DMT performance compared to the finite diversity order achieved by channel-agnostic, fixed-power RCT schemes.	channel state information;digital monetary trust;downtime;exptime;multiplexing;return channel;telecommunications link;test-driven development;transmitter	Bettagere Nagaraja Bharath;Chandra Ramabhadra Murthy	2012	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2012.092812.121611	real-time computing;telecommunications;power control;probability;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;estimation theory;fading;wireless;statistics	Mobile	36.65054355790651	77.74270282610333	189594
ad21a9b731d7a02c4bb2063fb8a51cf0f6e783b2	multistatic scatter radio sensor networks for extended coverage		Scatter radio, i.e., communication by means of reflection, has been recently proposed as a viable ultra-low power solution for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This paper offers a detailed comparison between monostatic and multistatic scatter radio architectures. In monostatic architecture, the reader consists of both the illuminating transmitter and the receiver of signals scattered back from the sensors. The multistatic architecture includes several ultra-low cost illuminating carrier emitters and a single reader. Maximum-likelihood coherent and noncoherent bit error rate (BER), diversity order, average information, and energy outage probability comparison is performed, under dyadic Nakagami fading and filling a gap in the literature. It is found that: 1) diversity order, BER, and tag location-independent performance bounds of multistatic architecture outperform monostatic; 2) energy outage due to radio frequency (RF) harvesting for passive tags, is less frequent in multistatic than monostatic architecture; and 3) multistatic coverage is higher than monostatic. Furthermore, a proof-of-concept digital multistatic scatter radio WSN with a single receiver, four low-cost emitters, and multiple ambiently-powered low-bitrate tags, perhaps the first of its kind, is experimentally demonstrated (at 13 dBm transmission power), covering an area of 3500 m2. Research findings are applicable in the industries of WSNs, RF identification, and emerging Internet-of-Things.	bit error rate;coherence (physics);concave function;dbm;downtime;dyadic transformation;emoticon;entropy (information theory);expanded memory;experiment;galaxy morphological classification;hp 48 series;interference (communication);iteration;jensen's inequality;portable document format;radio frequency;rayleigh fading;sensor;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;social inequality;sun outage;time complexity;transmitter;x.690	Panos N.

Among the various relaying protocols, the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy is well studied for its simplicity. However, to collect the cooperative diversity, there are two main issues that the AF protocol is facing. One is that the channel state information (CSI) of the source-to-relay link (i.e., two-hop CSI) is needed at the destination. The other concern is that the power scaling factor (PSF) and output signals at the relay are unbounded. These two issues make AF less practical in resource constrained networks, e.g., blind and peak power constrained relays. In this paper, we reveal the necessary and sufficient conditions on designing the PSF for the maximum ratio combining (MRC) receiver at the destination with two-hop (TH) CSI to achieve full cooperative diversity. Furthermore, we also provide the necessary conditions on the PSF design so that MRC with only one-hop (OH) CSI still collects full cooperative diversity. These designs make AF strategies more general and practical. The theoretical analysis is corroborated by numerical simulations.	anisotropic filtering;channel state information;computer simulation;cooperative multitasking;image scaling;numerical analysis;relay	Qijia Liu;Wei Zhang;Xiaoli Ma	2010	2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462022	computer simulation;telecommunications;computer science;cooperative diversity;fading;computer network	Mobile	35.08551586591225	81.51632814706936	191832
41a2fc0088e71ec5cee734bce343dd3b3ae9702a	efficient cooperative harq for multi-source multi-relay wireless networks		In this paper, we compare the performance of three different cooperative Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) protocols for slow-fading half-duplex orthogonal multiple access multiple relay channel. Channel State Information (CSI) is available at the receiving side of each link only. Time Division Multiplexing is assumed, where each orthogonal transmission occurs during a time-slot. Sources transmit in turns in consecutive time slots during the first transmission phase. During the second phase, the destination schedules in each time-slot one node (source or relay) to transmit redundancies based on its correctly decoded source messages (its decoding set) with the goal to maximize the average spectral efficiency. Bidirectional limited control channels are available from sources and relays towards the destination to implement the necessary control signaling of the HARQ protocols. Among the three proposed HARQ, two follow the Incremental Redundancy (IR) approach. One consists in sending incremental redundancies on all the messages from the scheduled node decoding set (Multi-User encoding) while the other one helps a single source (Single User encoding) chosen randomly. The third one is of the Chase Combining (CC) type, where the selected node repeats the transmission (including modulation and coding scheme) of one source chosen randomly from its decoding set. Monte-Carlo simulations confirm that the IR-type of HARQ with Multi-User encoding offers the best performance, followed by IR-type of HARQ with Single User encoding and CC-type of HARQ. We conclude that IR-type of HARQ with Single User encoding offers the best trade-off between performance and complexity for a small number of sources in our setting.

In existing works, the asymptotic capacity is only obtained in the high peak power region at secondary transmitter (ST) or obtained without considering the interference from primary transmitter (PT) for easy analysis. Here, we analyze the asymptotic capacity by considering an arbitrary peak power at the ST and the interference from the PT based on extreme value theory. Simulation results show that our approximated capacity is well-matched to the exact capacity. Furthermore, the scaling law of our capacity is found to be double logarithm of the number of secondary users.	approximation algorithm;asymptote;cognitive network;cognitive radio;extreme value theory;image scaling;interference (communication);maxima and minima;multipoint ground;pro tools;simulation;system analysis;telecommunications link;transmitter	Jianbo Ji;Wen Chen;Shanlin Sun	2013	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2013.000106	transmitter;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;transmitter power output;channel capacity;computer network	Mobile	36.987664075658195	80.56429122769505	192026

We evaluate the spectral efficiency of simple multi-user channels by combining the basic capture model with a communication-theoretic model. The result is a more refined capture model that incorporates key system design parameters (such as achievable bit rate, target bit error rate, channel bandwidth, and modulation signal constellations) that are absent from the basic capture model. The relationships among these parameters can serve as a tool for optimizing the network performance.	a mathematical theory of communication;bit error rate;capture effect;high- and low-level;interference (communication);key;modulation;multi-user;network performance;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;systems design;x.690	Gam D.

The authors’ analysis allows for a practical fading scenario where MS → RS and RS → BS channels undergo independent Rayleigh and Rician fading, respectively. Delay-limited throughput expressions for two HARQ protocols are derived, respectively, namely Repetition Time Diversity and Incremental Redundancy. Furthermore, the impact of different parameters on the achievable throughput, such as the maximum HARQ round number L, line-of-sight signal K, information rate R etc., is analysed. The authors’ analysis unveils that, for the presumed dual-hop cooperation model with the specified tolerable delay requirement and given channel condition, there exists an optimal information rate R* that achieves the maximum delay-limited throughput for the two HARQ protocols. Moreover, it is disclosed that, both HARQ protocols with the adaptive optimised information rate outperform the counterpart with the fixed information rate in low and moderate SNR regions, suggesting that an adaptive transmission scheme should be employed to achieve a better throughput performance.	hybrid automatic repeat request;throughput	Jing Yang;Pingzhi Fan;Qingchun Chen;Xianfu Lei	2013	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2012.0253	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;base station;mobile station;computer network	HPC	34.2356373540557	78.5040386349668	192644
b3017db745e8df926ef7e1a33bb7d75e158641e3	hybrid-arq protocol design with optimal time and power allocation		In this paper, an optimal power and time assignment strategy is developed for hybrid automatic-repeat-request (H-ARQ) communication protocol over quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels. For any given average total time duration and energy budget, we try to find the sequences of power values and time durations for H-ARQ retransmission rounds that minimize the outage probability of the H-ARQ protocol. We solve the joint optimization of power and time assignment for the H-ARQ protocol and derive a set of equations that describe the optimal transmission power and time duration sequence which enable a recursive calculation. Numerical results show that the performance of the proposed optimal-time and optimal-power assignment scheme is substantially better than that of the conventional equal-time and equal-power scheme as well as the equal-time and optimal-power scheme. For example, when the maximum transmission number is L=2 and the target data amount per packet is D_0=2000 bits, the optimal-time and optimal-power assignment scheme saves about 28dB in terms of the average energy consumption.	algorithm;communications protocol;downtime;hybrid automatic repeat request;mathematical optimization;network packet;rayleigh fading;recursion;recursion (computer science);retransmission (data networks);scheme;simulation	Kaiying Sun;Weifeng Su;John D.

The proposed scheme aggregates the `common' idle bands between source and the participating relays instead of `all' idle bands at the source as suggested in [1]. The earlier scheme fails if any of the idle bands at the source is unavailable across the relays. Nevertheless, the proposed scheme succeeds in this situation by aggregating the common idle bands only. If all idle bands of the source are available across the relays, both schemes are successful. Hence, the proposed scheme only fails in a rare event of no common idle bands. This reduces outage probability and improves channel capacity and bit error rate (BER) on average. We consider a more generalized Nakagami-m channel, which covers the Rayleigh channel used in [1]. Additionally, we extend the analysis from outage probability to BER and channel capacity. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the earlier scheme in terms of all major performance parameters.	bit error rate;channel capacity;downtime;extreme value theory;idle scan;rayleigh–ritz method;relay;simulation;sun outage;x.690	Saira Dawer Baig;Syed Imtiaz Hussain;Khalid A.

It can achieve ergodic capacity with limited feedback of channel state information (CSI) from a receiver. In this paper, using large deviations, we derive the quality of service (QoS) exponent of the HARQ-IR protocol over fading channels. This QoS exponent allows us to compare the throughput of HARQ-IR and the effective capacity of an adaptive transmission system with a buffer that requires instantaneous CSI. It is shown that the HARQ-IR protocol can be more effective when a higher QoS exponent is desired.	channel state information;ergodicity;hybrid automatic repeat request;quality of service;throughput	Jinho Choi	2012	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2012.042312.120454	telecommunications;computer science;fading;statistics;computer network	Networks	34.92846476116324	78.66882528747018	194156

This channel capacity and probability of outage are evaluated under Optimum Power with Rate Adaptation (OPRA) and Truncated Channel Inversion with Fixed Rate transmission (TIFR) schemes. Since, the channel capacity and probability of outage expressions contain an infinite series, the series are truncated and bounds on the truncated errors are presented. The corresponding expressions for Nakagami-0.5 fading are called expressions under worst fading condition with severe fading. Finally, numerical results are presented, which are then compared to the channel capacity and probability of outage results for no diversity case, which has been previously published under OPRA and TIFR schemes. It has been observed that OPRA provides improved average channel capacity and probability of outage, as compared to TIFR under worst case of fading.	best, worst and average case;channel capacity;downtime;numerical analysis;oriented point relation algebra;regular expression;sun outage	Mohammad Irfanul Hasan;Sanjay Kumar	2015	IJCNIS		mathematical optimization;distributed computing;uncorrelated;telecommunications;fading;series (mathematics);fading distribution;expression (mathematics);channel capacity;nakagami distribution;communication channel;computer science	ML	36.983072464175805	78.1449611291743	194950
1308a7c5667202aa9594270746a6035c39ed175a	performance analysis of joint relay selection and transmission schemes in multiple-antenna two-way relay systems	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;diversity gain;power allocation;physical layer networking coding;期刊论文;two way relay system;communications engineering networks	In this paper, we consider a two-way relay system with two multi-antenna sources and multiple single-antenna relays and study the performances for various transmission schemes with the assumption that perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at both the sources and the relays. Although a transmission scheme that combines source beamforming and relay selection (BF-RS) is known to improve a system performance, its performance has not been theoretically analyzed yet. In the paper, we focus on the performance analysis in terms of the symbol error probability (SEP) for the BF-RS scheme. The analytical upper and lower bounds of the end-to-end system SEP are derived in the closed form, and the asymptotic SEP expression is given in high SNR regime. By both analytical and simulation results, it is clearly shown that a full transmit and relay selection diversity gain can be achieved without code rate loss. The SEP curves from simulations show that our derived bounds can predict the performance accurately. Based on the derived analytical results, we propose an individual power allocation (IPA) scheme to save the total transmit power. We show that the IPA scheme can result in considerable energy saving with a comparable SEP performance.	beamforming;brainfuck;channel state information;code rate;end system;end-to-end principle;performance;profiling (computer programming);reed–solomon error correction;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;symantec endpoint protection	Chen Chen;Xingbin Wang;Yehua Yang;Ye Jin	2015	EURASIP J.

Under Rayleigh fading channels, the closed-form solution for the optimal location is derived. It is interesting to find that the optimal relay location is related to the power configuration of nodes and the pathloss exponent. When the direct link exists, the optimal location is partly dependent on the total number of the relays. Numerical results show that the approximation analysis matches the theory values very well, and with location optimization, the minimal outage probability can be obtained.	approximation;direction finding;downtime;hurst exponent;inline linking;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical method;rayleigh fading;relay	Changqing Yang;Wenbo Wang;Shuang Zhao;Mugen Peng	2010	2010 The 5th Annual ICST Wireless Internet Conference (WICON)		communications protocol;closed-form expression;telecommunications;computer science;cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition;fading;statistics	Metrics	36.184629291696766	79.17562213916267	195917

The proposed scheme considers relay selection via the available partial channel state information (CSI) at the source and the relays. More precisely, the source determines when it needs to cooperate with one relay only among arbitrary N relays and which relay to cooperate with in case of cooperation, i.e., """"When to cooperate?"""" and """"Whom to cooperate with?"""". In case of cooperation, the source employs the optimal relay, which has the maximum instantaneous scaled harmonic mean function of its source-relay and relay-destination channels' gains. For the symmetric scenario, we prove that full diversity is guaranteed and that a significant increase of the bandwidth efficiency is achieved. Furthermore, we show the tradeoff between the achievable bandwidth efficiency and the corresponding error rate.

6f3b07fdc70e369bb386a415e4fc20eb1ca7cdae	secrecy outage of proactive relay selection by eavesdropper		In this paper, we consider an active eavesdropping scenario in a cooperative system consisting of a source, a destination, and an active eavesdropper with multiple decode-and-forward relays. Considering an existing assumption in which an eavesdropper is also a part of network, a proactive relay selection by the eavesdropper is proposed. The best relay which maximizes the eavesdropping rate is selected by the eavesdropper. A relay selection scheme is also proposed to improve the secrecy of the system by minimizing the eavesdropping rate. Performances of these schemes are compared with two passive eavesdropping scenarios in which the eavesdropper performs selection and maximal ratio combining on the relayed links. A realistic channel model with independent non-identical links between nodes and direct links from the source to both the destination and eavesdropper are assumed. Closed- form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) of these schemes in Rayleigh fading channel are obtained. It is shown that the relay selection by the proactive eavesdropper is most detrimental to the system as not only the SOP increases with the increase in the number of relays, but its diversity also remains unchanged.	channel (communications);consensus dynamics;downtime;man-in-the-middle attack;maximal set;performance;proactive parallel suite;rayleigh fading;relay;sun outage	Sarbani Ghose;Chinmoy Kundu;Octavia A.

1d30f69655eb0fb8bc6372fb4e5b559a1f76b85e	sum-rate capacity of poisson mimo multiple-access channels		In this paper, we analyze the sum-rate capacity of two-user Poisson multiple input multiple output multiple-access channels (MACs), when both the transmitters and the receiver are equipped with multiple antennas. Although the sum-rate capacity of Poisson MISO MAC when the receiver is equipped with a single antenna has been characterized by us, the inclusion of multiple antennas at the receiver makes the problem more challenging and requires the development of new analytical tools. We first characterize the sum-rate capacity of the Poisson MAC when each transmitter has a single antenna and the receiver has multiple antennas. We obtain the optimal input that achieves the sum-rate capacity by solving a non-convex optimization problem. We show that, for certain channel parameters, it is optimal for a single user to transmit to achieve the sum-rate capacity, and for certain channel parameters, it is optimal for both users to transmit. We then characterize the sum-rate capacity of the channel where both the transmitters and the receiver are equipped with multiple antennas. We show that the sum-rate capacity of the Poisson MAC with multiple transmit antennas is equivalent to a properly constructed Poisson MAC with a single antenna at each transmitter, and has thus been characterized by the former case. We show this by developing a novel channel transformation argument.	convex optimization;fractional poisson process;mimo;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;system analysis;transmitter	Ain Ul Aisha;Lifeng Lai;Yingbin Liang;Shlomo Shamai Shitz	2017	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2737997	electronic engineering;mimo;computer science;transmitter;poisson distribution;optimization problem;communication channel	Mobile	37.05064058882076	81.49013692208958	198107

The objective of this paper is to investigate the cooperative diversity technique performed in a multi-hop DS-CDMA system, where the limiting factor in the system is the multi-access interference (MAl). We focus on the use of minimum mean-square error (MMSE) multiuser detection (MUD) in the uplink of cooperative CDMA networks. MMSE detectors are designed to suitably combine the signals from the direct path and relaying path and minimize the signal in the interference-and-noise ratio at the receiver output. We evaluate the bit error rate (BER) performance of cooperative transmission in narrow-band block fading channel. Also, MMSE detection is applied in a random CDMA network and the average performance is presented through Monte-Carlo simulations. It is illustrated that, through using MMSE detection in a non-orthogonal CDMA system, cooperation is beneficial in terms of introducing additional diversity gain and thus ensuring a low bit error rate.	best, worst and average case;bit error rate;interference (communication);mud;monte carlo method;multi-user;sensor;simulation;telecommunications link;x.690	Yang Cao;Branimir R.

In addition to being one of the first implementations of the DDF protocol proposed for any number of relays, this technique allows to exploit cooperative diversity without inducing the high decoding complexity of a space-time code. The analysis of outage probabilities for different number of relays and rotations shows that the performance of this technique is close to optimal. Moreover, a lower-bound on the diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT) is provided in the case of a single relay and two rotations. This lower-bound reaches the optimal DDF's DMT when the frame-length grows to infinity, which shows that even a small number of rotations is enough to obtain good performance.	computation;digital monetary trust;disk data format;distribution frame;downtime;multiplexing;numerical analysis;relay;soft-in soft-out decoder;sun outage	Charlotte Hucher;Parastoo Sadeghi	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5963483	communications protocol;telecommunications;rotation;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;cooperative diversity;upper and lower bounds;signal-to-noise ratio;space–time code;fading;statistics	Robotics	35.94077309378785	75.33191675281708	198692

Relaying protocols using two, three, and four time slots are proposed. The protocols using four time slots are the traditional amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols, which do not consider the property of the two-way traffic. A new class of relaying protocols, termed as partial decode-and-forward (PDF), is developed for the two time slots transmission, where each relay first removes part of the noise before sending the signal to the two terminals. Protocols using three time slots are proposed to compensate the fact that the two time slots protocols cannot make use of direct transmission between the two terminals. For all protocols, after processing their received signals, the relays encode the resulting signals using a distributed linear dispersion (LD) code. The proposed AF protocols are shown to achieve the diversity order of min{N,K}(1- (log log P/log P)), where N is the number of relays, P is the total power of the network, and K is the number of symbols transmitted during each time slot. When random unitary matrix is used for LD code, the proposed PDF protocols resemble random linear network coding, where the former operates on the unitary group and the latter works on the finite field. Moreover, PDF achieves the diversity order of min{N,K} but the conventional DF can only achieve the diversity order of 1. Finally, we find that two time slots protocols also have advantages over four-time-slot protocols in media access control (MAC) layer.	relay	Tao Cui;Feifei Gao;Tracey Ho;Arumugam Nallanathan	2009	IEEE Trans.

The simultaneously broadcasted packets are superimposed with a random pattern at each network node that receives them. A subset of the network nodes act as cooperative relays and forward the locally superimposed packets without decoding them. Each destination node recovers the desired packet with a successive interference cancelation (SIC) and decoding algorithm that exploits the pattern of the superimposed transmissions. Different flavors of the basic scheme are investigated and combine amplify-and-forward (AF) from the relays, and also retransmissions from the initial sources.	algorithm;interference (communication);network packet;relay;requirement;retransmission (data networks);scheduling (computing);simplified instructional computer;throughput	Antonios Argyriou	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6655435	radio broadcasting;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	33.49122529121543	76.30080500732919	198817

Each user encodes information as a number of redundant binary data streams which are concurrently transmitted over the channel at various power levels. The reception is performed in two stages: in the first stage, the data streams are separated by an iterative detector; they are individually error-control decoded in the second stage. Conditions for decoding convergence in terms of the density of data streams per power level are formulated. The technique is illustrated through the use of several examples, including one-to-many and many-to-one interference channels. It is proven that optimal degrees of freedom can be achieved for a number of interference channels and channel parameters.	binary data;concurrency (computer science);error detection and correction;interference (communication);iterative method;one-to-many (data model);redundant binary representation;transmitter	Dmitri V.

To combat the issue of distance dependent signal attenuation, multi-hop data transmission has recently been introduced for PLC systems. However, apart from the distance dependent signal attenuation, PLC systems also suffer from (i) the variation in signal amplitude (fading) because of reflections and (ii) impulsive noise. Thus, in this study, the channel for each hop of the multi-hop PLC system is modelled by a log-normal fading amplitude, which is clubbed to a distance dependent signal attenuation factor. To consider the effect of the impulsive noise along with the background noise, the additive noise at each node is modelled by a Bernoulli–Gaussian process. Analytical expressions for the end-to-end average BER for binary phase-shift keying, the average channel capacity and the outage probability are obtained. The merit of the multi-hop PLC system over a conventional direct transmission PLC system for fixed transmission power is shown through numerical results. The authors' results show that with increasing number of DF relays, the end-to-end average BER, the average channel capacity and the outage performance improve.	power-line communication;profiling (computer programming)	Ankit Dubey;Ranjan K.
