6545801932a61cf3b59ba83cd75140726fb5894d	cellular digital packet data for intelligent vehicle highway systems	intelligent vehicle highway system;cellular digital packet data	For Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS) to be a reality, a communication system, which can provide reliable communication capability in mobile environment, is needed. A cellular system capable of supporting data traffic, can satisfy many of the IVHS communication requirements; such as traveller information and traffic management, public transit monitoring and control, fleet management, truck monitoring, hazard and collision warning. Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) is a data transmission service which coexists with current cellular systems in the same frequency band and is presently being deployed. In this paper, we briefly summarize the salient features of CDPD system and evaluate its data transmission capacity. We also study suitability of CDPD for IVHS applications. Our study suggests that CDPD is capable of satisfying many of the functional requirements of IVHS. Furthermore, a mature IVHS system (with 50% penetration) will need approximately 36.5% of the capacity of CDPD system, even when the cellular system with which CDPD coexists, operates at its 2% Erland Capacity. With lesser penetration of IVHS, even smaller percentage of CDPD capacity will be needed. In conclusion, CDPD seems to be a promising technology for IVHS and should be further explored.

This paper provides a systematic review of high mobility communications. We first summarize a list of key challenges and opportunities in high mobility communication systems, then provide comprehensive reviews of techniques that can address these challenges and utilize the unique opportunities. The review covers a wide spectrum of communication operations, including the accurate modeling of high mobility channels, the transceiver structures that can exploit the properties of high mobility environments, the signal processing techniques that can harvest the benefits (e.g., Doppler diversity) and mitigate the impairments (e.g., carrier frequency offset, intercarrier interference, channel estimation errors) in high mobility systems, and the mobility management and network architectures that are designed specifically for high mobility systems. The survey focuses primarily on physical layer operations, which are affected the most by the mobile environment, with some additional discussions on higher layer operations, such as handover management and control-plane/user-plane decoupling, which are essential to high mobility operations. Future research directions on high mobility communications are summarized at the end of this paper.	carrier frequency offset;channel state information;coupling (computer programming);interference (communication);next-generation network;signal processing;systematic review;transceiver	Jingxian Wu;Pingzhi Fan	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2518085	cognitive radio;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;doppler effect;telecommunications;computer science;handover;mobility model;wireless;computer network	Mobile	22.69604711184393	85.38923858023219	194558
14ea43b7b2dc9020c259925add27b4ecae6f7a79	poster: visible light communication in the dark	energy efficiency;internet of things;visible light communication	We present a new visible light communication (VLC) primitive: VLC in the dark, where the communication sustains even when the LED light appears dark. We achieve the goal by reducing the duty cycle of the light source to an extremely low level (0.0019%) such that the illuminance is imperceptible to human eyes and yet can still be sensed by photodiodes to decode data. VLC in the dark consumes much lower energy than the conventional VLC links and thus is appealing for enabling VLC uplink or communication among Internet-of-Things devices with tight energy budget. We build a preliminary prototype to demonstrate its feasibility. Our current single link achieves 190.7 bps data rate with 46.8 microwatts power consumption at the LED.	data rate units;duty cycle;prototype;telecommunications link;vlc media player	Zhao Tian;Andrew T.

3abd9a918ef383feac9a2b253d9526ea76041559	the essential guide to realizing 5g-connected uavs with massive mimo		What will it take for drones—and the whole associated ecosystem—to take off? Arguably, infallible command and control (C&C) channels for safe and autonomous flying, and high-throughput links for multi-purpose live video streaming. And indeed, meeting these aspirations may entail a full cellular support, provided through 5G-and-beyond hardware and software upgrades by both mobile operators and manufacturers of these unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this article, we vouch for massive MIMO as the key building block to realize 5G-connected UAVs. Through the sheer evidence of 3GPPcompliant simulations, we demonstrate how massive MIMO can be enhanced by complementary network-based and UAVbased solutions, resulting in consistent UAV C&C support, large UAV uplink data rates, and harmonious coexistence with legacy ground users.	aerial photography;autonomous robot;coexist (image);ecosystem;high-throughput computing;multi-purpose viewer;multi-user mimo;signal processing;simulation;streaming media;telecommunications link;terrestrial television;throughput;unmanned aerial vehicle	Adrian García-Rodríguez;Giovanni Geraci;David López-Pérez;Lorenzo Galati Giordano;Ming Ding;Emil Björnson	2018	CoRR		mathematical optimization;mimo;telecommunications link;command and control;operator (computer programming);mathematics;software;communication channel;distributed computing	Networks	22.165503252478224	86.92660125606926	195476
4ea94a5fb4fb430015abfb61393bcb390dc82793	elements of visible light communication research		Visible light communication (VLC) has gained great attention from both the industry and the academia as it can potentially provide a solution to alleviate the congestion in the wireless spectrum, offloading the ever-increasing data traffic to the untamed optical spectrum while taking advantage of the pervasive lighting infrastructure. On the other hand, what is less obvious is that VLC has many unique characteristics which can in fact allows it to provide better support to existing applications or enable new applications, compared to its RF siblings. In this talk, I will touch upon a number of interesting elements in the latest research in the field: using cameras as a VLC receiver to enable pervasive augmented reality applications, alleviating traffic congestion on the roads and in the communication channels at the same time with vehicular VLC, and taking advantage of the invisible changes in visible light - light's polarization. I will close the talk by illustrating a number of open research problems and the roads ahead.	augmented reality;network congestion;open research;pervasive informatics;polarization (waves);radio frequency;vlc media player	Hsin-Mu Tsai	2017		10.1145/3129881.3139224	vehicular ad hoc network;computer network;visible light communication;wireless;visible spectrum;augmented reality;telecommunications;open research;traffic congestion;engineering;communication channel	Networks	20.844665932336344	84.11125141005179	196389
2970d65ea6980dc493fca7a2c9af561b6362aa05	waveform multiplexing for new radio: numerology management and 3d evaluation		A 5G communication system includes massive machine-type communication, enhanced mobile broadband, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication. To meet the requirements of 5G applications, researchers have considered various scalable subcarrier spacings and transmission time intervals. In this article, we introduce the concept of waveform multiplexing, which is a resource management system for numerology multiplexing that employs appropriate waveforms to various numerologies. It also possesses both a dynamic cyclic prefix and a minimum guard band, which are the key features for achieving high spectral efficiency. We verify the significant gain produced by proposed waveform multiplexing by performing extensive 3D ray-tracing- based system-level evaluations in realistic 3D environments. Finally, we provide guidelines on waveform multiplexing design by considering the time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics of the new radio waveform candidates.	ray tracing (graphics);requirement;scalability;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;waveform;wavelength-division multiplexing	Yeon-Geun Lim;Taehun Jung;Kwang Soon Kim;Chan-Byoung Chae;Reinaldo A.

Since its inception about a decade ago, it has evolved from a wild “academic” idea to one of the most vibrant research topics in the wireless communications community, as well as a main work item in 5G standardization. The concept is to equip base stations with arrays of many antennas that serve many terminals simultaneously, in the same time-frequency resource. The arrays have attractive form factors: in the 2 GHz band, a halfwave-length-spaced rectangular array with 200 dual-polarized elements is about 1.5 × 0.75 meters large. Massive MIMO operates in TDD mode and the downlink beamforming exploits the uplink-downlink reciprocity of radio propagation. Specifically, the base station array uses channel estimates obtained from uplink pilots transmitted by the terminals to learn the channel in both directions. This makes Massive MIMO entirely scalable with respect to the number of base station antennas. Base stations operate autonomously, with no sharing of payload data or channel state information with other cells. In this talk I will discuss the development of Massive MIMO over the last five years, and outline the most important research problems ahead.	assistive technology;beamforming;channel state information;computer form factor;many antennas;multi-user mimo;payload (computing);scalability;software propagation;telecommunications link;test-driven development	Erik G.

In this demo, we prove that it is possible to opportunistically exploit the inter-technology interference between 802.11 and 802.15.4 to build an unconventional low-rate communication channel and signalling protocol, devised to improve the performance of each contending technology. Differently from previous solutions, inter-technology communications do not require the deployment of a gateway with two network interfaces, but can be activated (when needed) directly between two heterogeneous nodes, e.g. a WiFi node and a ZigBee node. This capability can be very useful for coordinating channel access between WiFi and ZigBee networks, reading measurements from ZigBee sensors, or configuring ZigBee actuators (e.g. an on/off power switch) directly by using common smartphones or laptops which are only equipped with WiFi interfaces.	channel (communications);interference (communication);laptop;sensor;signaling protocol;smartphone;software deployment;switch	Daniele Croce;Natale Galioto;Domenico Garlisi;Costantino Giaconia;Fabrizio Giuliano;Ilenia Tinnirello	2014		10.1145/2643230.2643245	embedded system;neurfon;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	19.615509863457763	82.2722853359545	197067

In order to provide seamless and high quality service, wireless local area networks (WLANs) can adopt dynamic channel access technologies such as dynamic bandwidth or channel hopping schemes in order to avoid interference for better link quality. However, in dense networks, the dynamic channel access leads to a higher probability of adjacent channel interference (ACI). The efficiency of IEEE 802.11based WLANs using multi-channel and wide dynamic ranges is thus severely degraded by ACIs in dense networks. In this paper, we analyze the ACI effect on WLANs and propose an interference-aware selfoptimizing (IASO) Wi-Fi design that incorporates a multi-channel multi-level carrier sense and adaptive initial gain control scheme. This scheme controls carrier sensing thresholds in each band for multi-level sensors, as well as initial gains for amplifiers. The proposed scheme reduces false carrier sensing and avoids saturation of amplifiers while simultaneously improving the dynamic range of the receiver. Our prototype evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can improve the dynamic range of the receiver by approximately 45 dB and 30 dB for a low data rate and a high data rate mode, respectively, compared with the conventional receiver designs. Furthermore, network emulation results demonstrate that the IASO Wi-Fi can improve the average throughput, latency, and energy efficiency by approximately 32% (24%), 41% (43%), and 13% (17%), respectively, compared with the conventional receiver designs (and channel hopping techniques) in dynamically varying interfered channel conditions. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.	3d acis modeler;amplifier;catastrophic interference;data rate units;display resolution;dynamic range;emulator;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;interference (communication);internet of things;network emulation;prototype;quality of service;seamless3d;sensor;throughput	Il-Gu Lee;Myungchul Kim	2016	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2016.03.008	adjacent-channel interference;automatic gain control;telecommunications;computer science;internet of things;computer network	Mobile	24.332162788785915	88.24395307269617	197556
32ddb6bdc8dd3885d9b4fbdd28c8380dc3653a02	exploring user-provided connectivity - a simple model	externalities;sharing;connectivity	The advent of cheap and ubiquitous wireless access has introduced a number of new connectivity paradigms. This paper investigates one of them, user-provided connectivity or UPC. In contrast to traditional infrastructure-based connectivity, e.g., connectivity through the up-front build-out of expensive base-stations, UPC realizes connectivity organically as users join and expand its coverage. The low(er) deployment cost this aords is one of its main attractions. Conversely, the disadvantages of connectivity sharing and a high barrierto-entry from low initial penetration create strong disincentives to its adoption. The paper's contributions are in formulating and solving a simple model that captures key aspects of UPC adoption, and in articulating guidelines to make it successful. For analytical tractability, the model is arguably simplistic, but the robustness of its ndings is demonstrated numerically across a wide range of more general (and more realistic) con gurations.	approximation;e-reader;entropy maximization;mobile device;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;numerical analysis;programming paradigm;smartphone;software deployment;universal product code	Mohammad Hadi Afrasiabi;Roch Guérin	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24547-3_5	simulation;computer science;operations management;distributed computing	HCI	21.395694889535882	87.11520864314491	197708

These connected objects that compose the Internet of Things (IoT) are expected to extend to 50 or 80 billion worldwide by 2020.
