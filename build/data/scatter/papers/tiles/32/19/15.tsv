9b32e100ca8d436fa362fccf968065d31661a10a	multi-objective seismic design optimization of steel frames by a chaotic meta-heuristic algorithm		In this study, multi-objective optimization is applied to implement performance-based design of steel moment-resisting frame (SMRF) structures. In order to efficiently achieve this purpose, a chaotic multi-objective firefly algorithm (CMOFA) is proposed to find the Pareto optimal front for the multi-objective performance-based optimum design (MO-PBOD) problem of SMRFs. The structural weight and the maximum inter-story drift at performance levels are taken as the conflicting objective functions of the MO-PBOD problem which should be optimized simultaneously subject to serviceability and ultimate limit-state constraints. In order to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed CMOFA meta-heuristic, two benchmark truss examples and three MO-PBOD examples of SMRFs are presented. The numerical results demonstrate the better computational performance of the proposed CMOFA meta-heuristic in comparison with some existing multi-objective algorithms.	benchmark (computing);firefly algorithm;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;nanosat mo framework;numerical analysis;optimal design;pareto efficiency;seismic analysis	Saeed Gholizadeh;Amir Baghchevan	2017	Engineering with Computers	10.1007/s00366-017-0515-0	structural engineering;mathematical optimization;simulation;engineering	EDA	18.099926233756392	-2.6076498894566047	146502

This paper presents a two–level algorithm to tackle this problem: an upper–level algorithm is used to determine the most appropriate set of parameters for a lower–level metaheuristic. This approach is applied to an Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) metaheuristic that was designed to solve the Orienteering Problem (OP). That is a particular routing problem in which a score is earned for visiting a location. The objective is to maximise the sum of the scores, while not exceeding a given time budget. The ACO algorithm uses a set of ants that communicate through the environment by means of a pheromone trail. The transition rule and pheromone updating rules are influenced by a large number of parameters. These parameters are fine–tuned by a Genetic Algorithm (GA), which trains the ACO using test problems from the literature. The resulting ACO algorithm is compared with an exact algorithm by applying it to another set of problems. The scores obtained by the resulting algorithm are very near the optimal scores for the test problems.	ant colony optimization algorithms;central processing unit;computation;computational science;exact algorithm;experiment;genetic algorithm;genetic operator;heuristic;iteration;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;routing;selection rule;software release life cycle	Wouter Souffriau;Pieter Vansteenwegen;Greet Vanden Berghe;Dirk Van Oudheusden	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-79438-7_13	mathematical optimization;ant colony optimization algorithms;meta-optimization;parallel metaheuristic;operations management;machine learning;metaheuristic	AI	22.833785025203344	0.46658842153206675	146574
58921470d96542866450fc56740fa9f94954c0c0	solving the tool switching problem with memetic algorithms	tool switching problem;memetic algorithm;flexible manufacturing system;evolutionary algorithm;local search	The tool switching problem (ToSP) is well known in the domain of flexible manufacturing systems. Given a reconfigurable machine, the ToSP amounts to scheduling a collection of jobs on this machine (each of them requiring a different set of tools to be completed), as well as the tools to be loaded/unloaded at each step to process these jobs, such that the total number of tool switches is minimized. Different exact and heuristic methods have been defined to deal with this problem. In this work, we focus on memetic approaches to this problem. To this end, we have considered a number of variants of three different local-search techniques (namely hill climbing, tabu search and simulated annealing), and embedded them in a permutational evolutionary algorithm. It is shown that the memetic algorithm endowed with steepest-ascent hill climbing search yields the best results, performing synergistically better than its stand-alone constituents, and providing better results than the rest of the algorithms (including those returned by an effective ad-hoc beam search heuristic defined in the literature for this problem).	beam search;embedded system;evolutionary algorithm;heuristic;hill climbing;hoc (programming language);memetic algorithm;memetics;network switch;scheduling (computing);simulated annealing;synergy;tabu search;times ascent	Jhon Edgar Amaya;Carlos Cotta;Antonio J.

4306e853ca880d852db44adccc7512a42c792c2b	solving distributed asymmetric constraint satisfaction problems using an evolutionary society of hill-climbers	distributed constraint satisfaction problem;message passing;constraint satisfaction problem	The distributed constraint satisfaction problem (DisCSP) can be viewed as a 4-tuple (X, D, C, A), where X is a set of n variables, D is a set of n domains (one domain for each of the n variables), C is a set of constraints that constrain the values that can be assigned to the n variables, and A is a set of agents for which the variables and constraints are distributed. The objective in solving a DisCSP is to allow the agents in A to develop a consistent distributed solution by means of message passing. In this paper, we present an evolutionary society of hillclimbers (ESoHC) that outperforms a previously developed algorithm for solving randomly generated DisCSPs that are composed of asymmetric constraints on a test suite of 2,800 distributed asymmetric constraint satisfaction problems.	algorithm;constraint satisfaction problem;distributed constraint optimization;message passing;procedural generation;randomness;test suite	Gerry V.

In this way, the process planner is presented with a selection of solutions offering a good trade-off between total machining time and total tooling costs. The majority of previous research has concentrated either on optimising tool selection or machining parameters. In the presented approach, each tool in a sequence has its most important parameter, cutting speed, simultaneously optimised creating a problem with both discrete and continuous properties. The major constraint, excess material, is included as an additional objective. The problem is solved using NSGA-II with preferential search modifications to guide solutions towards the feasible region.	feasible region;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;offset binary	Alexander W.

In this paper, a swarm-based algorithm is proposed to autonomously perform the assignment of respondents to interviewers to facilitate the fieldwork planning of a face-to-face survey involving close to 32,000 pre-selected respondents and 100 interviewers. The assignment is to be performed in two stages. Firstly, K-means clustering is used to group/cluster the survey respondents based on their geographical locations. This ensures that respondents staying close to one another are visited by the same interviewer in the same survey period. The second stage employs a novel Selective Probabilistic Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (SPD-PSO) technique to assign the respective clusters of respondents to the interviewers to minimize the travel distance of each interviewer while trying to achieve a near-even spread of the survey workload across all the interviewers. The effectiveness of the proposed SPD-PSO algorithm is then evaluated by comparing its allocation results against those of two selected benchmark methods.	algorithm;assignment (computer science);benchmark (computing);best practice;cluster analysis;evaluation function;exploit (computer security);field research;fitness function;heuristic;k-means clustering;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;randomness;software deployment;velocity (software development)	Ming Shu Seah;Whye Loon Tung;Timothy Banks	2015	2015 11th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC)	10.1109/ICNC.2015.7378001	mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence	AI	18.2811337217033	-0.5929004957858633	147660

In the case of a multiobjective lower level, we deal with a set of Pareto‐efficient solutions rather than a single optimal lower level solution. To calculate the upper level objective function value, we need to select one solution out of a potentially large set of efficient lower level solutions. To avoid the enumeration of the whole set of Pareto solutions, we formulate an auxiliary mixed integer linear programming problem with a large number of constraints. We propose an iterative exact method to solve it. To find a near‐optimal upper level solution, we apply a metaheuristic. The method is tested on the discrete (r|p)‐centroid problem with multiple objectives at the lower level.

The FINDP has been recently proposed as an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem formed by two smaller sub-problems: first, given the nodes which form the network, classify them as belonging to the backbone network or not. The second sub-problem consists of assigning the access network to a hub (node of the backbone network). In this paper we propose a parallel evolutionary algorithm to tackle the FINDP. We describe the architecture and how to structure the algorithm to solve the problem. Experimental tests have been carried out in several synthetic instances, and a comparison with existing approaches have shown the good performance of our algorithm.	access network;combinatorial optimization;evolutionary algorithm;internet backbone;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;network planning and design;optimization problem;synthetic intelligence;the hub (forum);usb hub	Emilio G.

The nurse rostering problem (NRP) is a combinatorial optimization problem tackled by assigning a set of shifts to a set of nurses, each has specific skills and work contract, to a predefined rostering period according to a set constraints. The metaheuristics are the most successful methods for tackling this problem. This paper proposes a metaheuristic technique called a hybrid artificial bee colony (HABC) for NRP. In HABC, the process of the employed bee operator is replaced with the hill climbing optimizer (HCO) to empower its exploitation capability and the usage of HCO is controlled by hill climbing rate (HCR) parameter. The performance of the proposed HABC is evaluated using the standard dataset published in the first international nurse rostering competition 2010 (INRC2010). This dataset consists of 69 instances which reflect this problem in many real-world cases that are varied in size and complexity. The experimental results of studying the effect of HCO using different value of HCR show that the HCO has a great impact on the performance of HABC. In addition, a comparative evaluation of HABC is carried out against other eleven methods that worked on INRC2010 dataset. The comparative results show that the proposed algorithm achieved two new best results for two problem instances, 35 best published results out of 69 instances as achieved by other comparative methods, and comparable results in the remaining instances of INRC2010 dataset.	artificial bee colony algorithm;nurse scheduling problem	Mohammed A.

It is based on reducing the problem complexity by the systematic application of vaccines, it is inspired in the concept of immunization derived from Artificial Immune Systems. The method can be applied practically to any combinatorial problem program solver such as genetic algorithms, memetic algorithms, artificial immune systems, ant colony optimization, the Dantzig–Fulkerson– Johnson algorithm, etc., providing optimal and suboptimal routes outperforming the selected algorithm itself. As a direct consequence of reducing problem complexity, the method provides a means to bring combinatorial optimization open problems that are too big to be treated by known techniques to a tractable point where acceptable solutions can be obtained. To demonstrate the proposed methodology the Traveling Salesman Problem for huge quantity of cities was used, we tested the method with modern evolutionary algorithms and the Concorde program. Comparative experiments that shows the effectiveness of the method are presented. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Other facilities offering the same product or service already exist in the area. Both the location and the quality of the new facility are to be found so as to maximize the profit obtained by the firm. This is a hard-to-solve global optimization problem. An evolutionary algorithm called Universal Evolutionary Global Optimizer (UEGO) seems to be the best procedure to cope with it, but the algorithm needs several hours of CPU time for solving large instances. In this paper, four parallelizations of UEGO are presented. They all are coarse-grain methods which differ in their migratory policies. A computational study is carried out to compare the performance of the parallel algorithms. The results show that one of the parallelizations always gives the best objective function value and has an almost linear speed-up for up to 16 processing elements for large instances.	parallel algorithm	Juana López Redondo;José Fernández;Inmaculada García;Pilar Martínez Ortigosa	2008	Optimization Methods and Software	10.1080/10556780802402564	mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;evolutionary algorithm;mathematics;parallel algorithm;profitability index;global optimization	Theory	18.53443869968642	2.7988525595628575	148116

The conventional ant colony optimization is adapted by the graph theory to always create feasible radial topologies during the whole evolutionary process. This avoids tedious mesh check and hence reduces the computational burden. The initial population is created randomly and a heuristic spark is introduced to enhance the pace of the search process. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on balanced and unbalanced test distribution systems. The simulation results show that the proposed method is efficient and promising for reconfiguration problem of radial distribution systems.	ant colony optimization algorithms;mathematical optimization;unbalanced circuit	Anil Swarnkar;Nikhil Gupta;Khaleequr Rehman Niazi	2011	Swarm and Evolutionary Computation	10.1016/j.swevo.2011.05.004	mathematical optimization;engineering;operations management;distributed computing;metaheuristic	EDA	19.57924263410252	2.2135975057831243	148324

In the presented method, simulated annealing based fitness evaluation approach (SABFEA) is developed to be able to make fitness function calculations easily and effectively. A new fitness function is adapted to MMULs for aiming at minimizing the number of workstations as primary goal and smoothing the workload between-within workstations by taking all cycles into consideration. A numerical example to clarify the solution methodology is presented. Performance of the proposed approach is tested through sets of test problem with randomly generated minimum part sets. The results of the computational experiments indicate that SABFEA works with PGA very concordantly; and it is an effective method in solving MMUL/BS with parallel workstations and zoning constraints.	genetic algorithm;mixed model;workstation	Alper Hamzadayi;Gokalp Yildiz	2012	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2011.09.008	mathematical optimization;simulation;genetic algorithm;simulated annealing;computer science;operations management;machine learning	SE	18.45469422955744	0.8962031826905569	148547

6c9e7679f002ae4637dcc2e5d27948e8929d9e31	asynchronous evolutionary shape optimization based on high-quality surrogates: application to an air-conditioning duct		Multi-processor HPC tools have become commonplace in industry and research today. Evolutionary algorithms may be elegantly parallelized by broadcasting a whole population of designs to an array of processors in a computing cluster or grid. However, issues arise due to synchronization barriers: subsequent iterations have to wait for the successful execution of all jobs of the previous generation. When other users load a cluster or a grid, individual tasks may be delayed and some of them may never complete, slowing down and eventually blocking the optimization process. In this paper, we extend the recent “Futures” concept permitting the algorithm to circumvent such situations. The idea is to set the default values to the cost function values calculated using a high-quality surrogate model, progressively improving when “exact” numerical results are received. While waiting for the exact result, the algorithm continues using the approximation and when the data finally arrives, the surrogate model is updated. At convergence, the final result is not only an optimized set of designs, but also a surrogate model that is precise within the neighborhood of the optimal solution. We illustrate this approach with the cluster optimization of an A/C duct of a passenger car, using a refined CFD legacy software model along with an adaptive meta-model based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and diffuse approximation.	approximation;approximation algorithm;black and burst;blocking (computing);central processing unit;computer cluster;deadlock;evolutionary algorithm;fifo (computing and electronics);futures and promises;gradient;iteration;job stream;legacy system;local optimum;loss function;mathematical optimization;metamodeling;multi-objective optimization;numerical analysis;parallel computing;pareto efficiency;principal component analysis;programming paradigm;scalability;shape optimization;simulation;surrogate model;surrogates;synchronization (computer science);timeout (computing)	Balaji Raghavan;Piotr Breitkopf	2012	Engineering with Computers	10.1007/s00366-012-0263-0	mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;database;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	HPC	19.625053176948327	1.0938462644347613	148621
63a2562b1cea6f53ba1f6a04c9ca200c7ecc9114	solid waste collection in ciudad universitaria-unam using a vrp approach and max-min ant system algorithm		The collection of solid waste is a very important problem for most of the modern cities of the world. The solution to this problem requires to apply optimization techniques capable of design the best path routes that guarantee to collect all the waste minimizing the cost. Several computation techniques could be applied to solve this problem and one of the most suitable could be swarm optimization such as ant colony optimization. In this paper, we propose a methodology for searching a set of collection paths of solid waste that optimize the distance of a tour in Ciudad Universitaria (UNAM). This methodology uses a vehicle routing problem (VRP) approach combined with Max-Min Ant System algorithm. To assess the accuracy of the proposal, we select the scholar circuit in the area of Ciudad Universitaria. The results shown a shortest distance travelled and better distribution than the empiric route used actually for the cleaning service.		Katya Rodríguez-Vázquez;Beatriz A.

Solving such problems may be challenging and time consuming when the aim is to find the most preferred Pareto optimal solution. In this study, we propose a method where we use an advanced clustering technique to reveal essential characteristics of the approximation of the Pareto optimal set, which has been generated beforehand. Thus, the decision maker (DM) is involved only after the most time consuming computation is finished. After the initiation phase, a moderate number of cluster prototypes projected to the Pareto optimal set is presented to the DM to be studied. This allows him/her to rapidly gain an overall understanding of the main characteristics of the problem without placing too much cognitive load on the DM. Furthermore, we also suggest some ways of applying our approach to different types of problems and demonstrate it with an example related to internal combustion engine design.	analysis of algorithms;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization	Timo Aittokoski;Sami Äyrämö;Kaisa Miettinen	2009	Optimization Methods and Software	10.1080/10556780802525331	optimization problem;mathematical optimization;internal combustion engine;computer science;multi-objective optimization;machine learning;mathematics;cognitive load	AI	20.728968203737598	-2.8350836953253404	148963

The extension assumes that resources are only partially available. It also assumes that renewable resources affect the project cost. The cost should be as low as possible and a deadline of the project must be met. This is apparent with regard to software houses and building enterprises. Computational experiments showed that supervisors find solutions of the problem much faster than other genetic approaches. A specific property of the supervisor is that it has various strategies of allocating the resources to the tasks. The supervisor uses the strategies in order to develop a procedure for producing the best schedule for the whole project. The analysis of the evolutionary process was performed and experimental results were compared with the optimal ones obtained by means of the exhaustive search method.	brute-force search;computation;experiment;genetic programming;global optimization;mathematical optimization;schedule (project management);software house	Grzegorz Pawinski;Krzysztof Sapiecha	2016	Applied Intelligence	10.1007/s10489-016-0791-1	mathematical optimization;simulation;resource allocation;computer science;machine learning;schedule;global optimization	AI	20.491282645060508	-0.7913960778685711	149695

Central to this endeavour is the problem of determining the best set of agents that should participate in a given team. To this end, in this paper, we present a novel, anytime algorithm for coalition structure generation that is faster than previous anytime algorithms designed for this purpose. Our algorithm can generate solutions that either have a tight bound from the optimal or are optimal (depending on the objective) and works by partitioning the space in terms of a small set of elements that represent structures which contain coalitions of particular sizes. It then performs an online heuristic search that prunes the space and only considers valid and non-redundant coalition structures. We empirically show that we are able to find solutions that are, in the worst case, 99% efficient in 0.0043% of the time to find the optimal value by the state of the art dynamic programming (DP) algorithm (for 20 agents), using 66% less memory.	anytime algorithm;best, worst and average case;branch and bound;davis–putnam algorithm;dynamic programming;endeavour (supercomputer);heuristic;information system;multi-agent system;optimization problem	Talal Rahwan;Sarvapali D.

f4e19e2cd0f6e284754e10f1bb4689dba48aac06	randomized heuristics for the mapping problem	graph separator algorithms;genetic algorithms;combinatorial optimization;mapping problem;randomized heuristics	The combinatorial optimization problem of assigning parallel tasks onto a multiprocessor so as to minimize the execution time is termed as the mapping problem. This problem even in its simplest form is known to be NP-hard. Several heuristic solutions that have been proposed seek to obtain a 'good' sub-optimal mapping in a reasonable time. In this paper we present two randomized heuristics for the mapping problem one of which is based on Plaisted's randomized graph separator heuristic while the other is based on the principles of genetic algorithms. We empirically compare the performance of our algorithms with two other such existing randomized mapping algorithms. One of them is the recursive min-cut partitioning heuristic due to Sadayappan et al., while the other is a simple genetic algorithm for mapping of our earlier work. This comparison of relative performance of the four randomized algorithms indicates that the genetic class of algorithms always produces better mappings than algorithms of the clustering class. In addition it is found that the recursive separator mapping algorithm performs as good as the recursive clustering algorithm while our new variant of genetic algorithm performs no better than our simple genetic algorithm.	heuristic (computer science);randomized algorithm	S.

The composite SaaS placement problem is to determine where each of the components should be deployed in a cloud computing environment such that the performance of the composite SaaS is optimal. From the computational point of view, the composite SaaS placement problem is a large-scale combinatorial optimization problem. Thus, an Iterative Cooperative Co-evolutionary Genetic Algorithm (ICCGA) was proposed. The ICCGA can nd reasonable quality of solutions. However, its computation time is noticeably slow. Aiming at improving the computation time, we propose an unsynchronized Parallel Cooperative Co-evolutionary Genetic Algorithm (PCCGA) in this paper. Experimental results have shown that the PCCGA not only has quicker computation time, but also generates better quality of solutions than the ICCGA.	cloud computing;combinatorial optimization;component-based software engineering;computation;genetic algorithm;iterative method;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;point of view (computer hardware company);software as a service;time complexity	Maolin Tang;Zeratul Izzah Mohd Yusoh	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-32964-7_23	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;distributed computing	HPC	19.50208196493715	-1.2317588264176424	151450

Generally, the reader-to-reader collision can be mitigated by maximizing the tag identification capability, which is related to frequencies and time slots, so it can be transferred as a resource scheduling problem by optimizing the tag identification capability. Artificial immune system is an emerging heuristic evolutionary method which is widely applied to scientific researches and engineering problems. This paper formulates a reader-to-reader anti-collision model from the viewpoint of resource scheduling and proposes an adaptive hierarchical artificial immune system (RA-AHAIS) to solve this optimization problem. A series of simulation experiments are arranged to analyzing the effects of time slots and frequency. Further simulation experiments are made to compare such performance indices as number of identified tags between the proposed RA-AHIAS and the other existing algorithms. The numerical simulation results indicate that this proposed RA-AHAIS is an effective reader-to-reader anti-collision method, and performs better in tag identification capability and computational efficiency than the other methods, such as genetic algorithm (RA-GA), particle swarm optimization (RA-PSO) and artificial immune system for resource allocation (RA-AIS).	algorithm;artificial immune system;radio-frequency identification	Zhonghua Li;Chunhui He;Jianming Li;Xiao Huang	2014	Expert Syst.

This paper aims to use a hybrid genetic algorithm for tackling such problems. The proposed hybrid algorithm integrates a simple local search strategy as the worst-case-scenario technique of anti-optimization with a constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The work demonstrates the use of a technique alternating between optimization (general GA) and anti-optimization (local search). Local search utilizes specialized search engines that allow users to submit constrained searches. The algorithm has been tuned and its performance evaluated through specially formulated test problems referred to as ‘Target Matching Problems’ with multiple objectives. The results obtained indicate that the approach can produce good results at reasonable computational costs.	best, worst and average case;combinatorial optimization;computation;evolutionary algorithm;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithm;hybrid algorithm;ieee congress on evolutionary computation;interval arithmetic;local search (optimization);matching (graph theory);mathematical optimization;memetic algorithm;web search engine	Nianfeng F.

Because of the intrinsic computational complexity, the approximate algorithms are commonly employed to solve the CVRP rather than the exact algorithms. In this research, the artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), derived from the swarm intelligence, is adapted to handle the CVRP. The application of the ABC algorithm in solving the CVRP exploited the inherent features of the swarm intelligence. More importantly, a routing directed ABC algorithm (RABC) is further proposed consisting of numerous improvements in order to enhance the capability of the diversified search and intensified search of the conventional ABC algorithm, which incorporates the useful information from the routing as well. The RABC algorithm is examined with different benchmark test instances. The experimental results show that the RABC algorithm excels the conventional ABC algorithm significantly. Moreover, the application of the RABC algorithm in solving the CVRP can provide practical insights for the implementation of swarm intelligence in solving other combinatorial optimization problems.	approximation algorithm;artificial bee colony algorithm;benchmark (computing);computational complexity theory;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;vehicle routing problem	Shaojia Zhang;C.

A good assembly sequence can help reduce the cost and time of manufacturing process. However, ASP is difficult to be tackled; the size of the search space of assembly sequences is exponentially proportional to the number of components of assembly products. Compared with traditional graph-based algorithm, the intelligent optimisation algorithms have exhibited their advantages in finding optimal assembly sequence. In this paper, harmony search (HS) is proposed to help solve the ASP problem. HS algorithm has been successfully applied to continuous-variable as well as combinatorial optimisation problems.

The permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSSP) is one of the most widely studied production scheduling problems and a typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems as well. In this paper, a self-guided differential evolution with neighborhood search (NS-SGDE) is presented for the PFSSP with the objectives of minimizing the maximum completion time. Firstly, some constructive heuristics are incorporated into the discrete harmony search (DHS) algorithm to initialize the population. Secondly, a guided agent based on the probabilistic model is proposed to guide the DE-based exploration phase to generate the offspring. Thirdly, multiple mutation and crossover operations based on the guided agent are employed to explore more effective solutions. Fourthly, the neighborhood search based on the variable neighborhood search (VNS) is designed to further improve the search ability. Moreover, the convergence of NS-SGDE for PFSSP is analyzed according to the theory of Markov chain. Computational simulations and comparisons with some existing algorithms based on some widely used benchmark instances of the PFSSP are carried out, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NS-SGDE in solving the PFSSP.	differential evolution;flow shop scheduling;local search (optimization);scheduling (computing)	Weishi Shao;Dechang Pi	2016	Expert Syst.

The objective of the model is to minimize cost. The cost elements included in the model are: cost of intracell and inter-cell moves, and the cost of the equipment used in the cells. The cost of an intra-cell move is based on the size of the cell in terms of the number of machines included in the cell. The procedures were tested on 19 problems obtained from the literature. The results show that a previous method developed by Sankaran and Kasilingam (1993) is very efficient but generates poor solutions. A tabu search procedure that starts with the solution generated by the Sankaran and Kasilingam procedure significantly improved the solutions. A second tabu search procedure that uses a new method of developing an initial solution also generated better solutions than the Sankaran and Kasilingam procedure and on the larger sized problems generated the best solutions. q 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents the first path relinking (PR) approach for solving FS-FAP. We devise four relinking operators to generate intermediate solutions (or paths) and a tabu search procedure for local optimization.

To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we present computational results on the set of 42 benchmark instances commonly used in the literature and compare them with the current best results obtained by any other existing methods. By showing improved best results (new upper bounds) for 19 instances, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PR approach. We investigate the impact of the relinking operators and the population updating strategy. The ideas of the proposed could be applicable to other frequency assignment problems and search problems.	algorithm;assignment problem;benchmark (computing);computation;face animation parameter;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;search problem;tabu search;x86 memory segmentation	Xiangjing Lai;Jin-Kao Hao	2015	Expert Syst.

The performance of the proposed algorithm is highlighted through the implementation of a Decision Support System (DSS). Some benchmark problems are selected to test the performance of the proposed hybrid method. We compare the ability of our algorithm with the classical ACO and against some well-known methods. The experiments show that the proposed hybrid method can efficiently improve the quality of solutions than the classical ACO algorithm, and distinctly speed up computing time. Our approach is also better than the performance of compared algorithms in most cases in terms of solution quality and robustness.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms	Islem Kaabachi;Dorra Jriji;Saoussen Krichen	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-59060-8_58	computer science;robustness (computer science);artificial intelligence;ant colony optimization algorithms;machine learning;travelling salesman problem;speedup;decision support system;local search (optimization);algorithm;combinatorial optimization	EDA	23.097525278375826	0.06176324767355653	156755

More precisely, we focus on the stand-alone heuristics for 0---1 MIP as well as those heuristics that use linear programming techniques or solve a series of linear programming models or reduced problems, deduced from the initial one, in order to produce a high quality solution of a considered problem. Our emphasis will be on how mathematical programming techniques can be used for approximate problem solving, rather than on comparing performances of heuristics.	heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization	Saïd Hanafi;Raca Todosijevic	2017	J.

4e9b733fba773624ee76065ba716efbe7bb99979	a hybrid approach for stator winding design optimization		Large electrical machines (e.g. hydro generators or motors for mining applications) are typically designed and built specifically for their site of installation. Engineering these one-of-a-kind designs requires a considerable amount of time and effort, with no guarantees that the final blueprint is cost-optimal. One part of the design involves the stator windings, i.e. the static part of an electric motor generating an electromagnetical field. In order to achieve low harmonic losses during operation, fractional windings are preferred, where the number of slots per phase in the stator is not a multiple of the number of poles. This renders the layout of the stator winding a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. The paper proposes a decomposition approach in which the problem can be reformulated as a rich variant of the Travelling Salesman Problem in which both MIP and CP are employed to tackle the problem.

In this paper, an ant colony optimization (ACO) approach is proposed for the team orienteering problem. Four methods, i.e., the sequential, deterministic-concurrent and random-concurrent and simultaneous methods, are proposed to construct candidate solutions in the framework of ACO. We compare these methods according to the results obtained on well-known problems from the literature. Finally, we compare the algorithm with several existing algorithms. The results show that our algorithm is promising.

Algorithms based on the exploration of the neighborhood of a single solution like simulated annealing (SA) have of- fered very accurate results for a large number of real-world problems. Although this kind of algorithms are quite efficient, more improvements are needed to address the large temporal complexity of industrial problems. One possible way to improve the performance is the utilization of parallel methods. The field of parallel models for trajectory methods has not been deeply studied. The new proposed parallel coop- erative model allows both to reduce the global execution time and to improve the efficacy. We have evaluated this model in two very different techniques (SA and PALS) solving a real-world problem (the DNA Fragment Assembly).	metaheuristic	Gabriel Luque;Francisco Murilo Tavares Luna;Enrique Alba	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14883-5_71	mathematical optimization;simulation;parallel metaheuristic;computer science;theoretical computer science	HPC	23.94944872198684	-1.2224206965059736	159839

Happening disorder in one elements of network (hubs or arcs), may lead to network breakdown or poor service levels. This study presents multi-objective single allocation hub covering location which is by exploring the tradeoff between the total cost and total number of intermediate links between all origins and destinations, offers a scenario ideal from the investor point of view and so convenient from the customer point of view. This study also gives this assurance that the minimum reliability of all routes that formed by hubs and arcs does not less than a specified value (controls the network minimum reliability). The type of coverage that rarely studied in the literature and does not have other type’s deficiency is used. Moreover, this paper presents a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, which its parameters are tuned by response surface methodology, to find near optimal pareto solutions for the given problem. The reliability of the proposed algorithm, based on three evaluation metrics (number of pareto solutions, spacing metric, diversity metric) is determined. Computational results of Turkish dataset are presented for better illustration of the proposed model.	multi-objective optimization;usb hub	Maryam Eghbali;Mostafa Abedzadeh;Mostafa Setak	2014	Int. J.

45858a3f3ce12a6314b40f7b18fcb8550069fd41	a new estimation of distribution algorithm to solve the multiple traveling salesmen problem with the minimization of total distance		Even though the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have recently been applied to solve many hard problems, only a few EDAs discussed the in-group optimization problems, such as the multiple traveling salesmen problem (mTSP) studied in this research. These problems include the assignment and sequencing procedures in the same time and to be shown in different forms. As a result, this research proposed an algorithm deal by using the Self-Guided GA together with the Minimum Loading Assignment rule (MLA) to tackle the mTSP. We compare the proposed algorithm against the best direct encoding technique, two-part encoding genetic algorithm, in the experiment on the 33 instances drawn from the well-known TSPLIB. The experimental results show the proposed algorithm is better than the compared algorithm in terms of minimization of the total traveling distance. An interesting result also presents the proposed algorithm would not cause longer traveling distance when we increase the number of salesmen from 3 to 10 persons under the objective of minimization of total traveling distance. This research may suggest the EDAs researcher could employ the MLA rule instead of the direct encoding algorithms.	estimation of distribution algorithm;travelling salesman problem	S. H. Chen;Y. H.

The single machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times with the objective of minimizing the total weighted tardiness is a challenging problem due to its complexity, and has a huge number of applications in real production environments. In this paper, we propose a memetic algorithm that combines and extends several ideas from the literature, including a crossover operator that respects both the absolute and relative position of the tasks, a replacement strategy that improves the diversity of the population, and an effective but computationally expensive neighborhood structure. We propose a new decomposition of this neighborhood that can be used by a variable neighborhood descent framework, and also some speed-up methods for evaluating the neighbors. In this way we can obtain competitive running times. We conduct an experimental study to analyze the proposed algorithm and prove that it is significantly better than the state-of-the-art in standard benchmarks.	memetic algorithm;memetics	Miguel Angel González;Camino R.

3b6f36c84ae9b400d3d42ebd1f56abd7a95cd199	algorithm selection on generalized quadratic assignment problem landscapes		Algorithm selection is useful in decision situations where among many alternative algorithm instances one has to be chosen. This is often the case in heuristic optimization and is detailed by the well-known no-free-lunch (NFL) theorem. A consequence of the NFL is that a heuristic algorithm may only gain a performance improvement in a subset of the problems. With the present study we aim to identify correlations between observed differences in performance and problem characteristics obtained from statistical analysis of the problem instance and from fitness landscape analysis (FLA). Finally we evaluate the performance of a recommendation algorithm that uses this information to make an informed choice for a certain algorithm instance.	algorithm selection;cplex;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;microsoft outlook for mac;nfl;performance;quadratic assignment problem;whole earth 'lectronic link	Andreas Beham;Stefan Wagner;Michael Affenzeller	2018		10.1145/3205455.3205585	mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;fitness landscape;machine learning;performance improvement;heuristic (computer science);quadratic assignment problem;heuristic;computer science;algorithm selection	AI	22.787365327150116	0.6935180363513325	162680
31178e121f9c699ab2d45f8c03048effc1a31dfd	a genetic algorithm-based method for optimizing the energy consumption and performance of multiprocessor systems		In a multiprocessor system, scheduling is an NP-hard problem, and solving it using conventional techniques demands the support of evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GAs). Handling the energy consumption issues, while delivering the desired performance for a system, is also a challenging task. In order to achieve these goals, this paper proposes a GA-based method for optimizing the energy consumption and performance of multiprocessor systems using a weighted-sum approach. A performance optimization algorithm with two different selection operators, namely the proportional roulette wheel selection (PRWS) and the rank-based roulette wheel selection (RRWS), is proposed, and the impact of adding elitism in the GA is investigated. Simulation results show that for a specific task graph, using the considered selection operators with elitism yields, respectively, 16.80, 17.11 and 17.82% reduction in energy consumption with a deviation in finish time of 2.08, 2.01 and 1.76 ms when an equal weight factor of 0.5 is considered. This confirms that the selection operator RRWS is superior to PRWS. It is also seen that using elitism enhances the optimization procedure. For a given specific workload, the average percentage reduction in energy consumption with varying weight vector is in the range 12.57–19.51%, with a deviation in finish time of the schedule varying between 1.01 and 2.77 ms.	genetic algorithm;multiprocessing	Anju S.

17a235877494a62dc43de1f593da1362cfc941c5	an investigation of monte carlo tree search and local search for course timetabling problems		The work presented in this thesis focuses on solving course timetabling problems, a variant of education timetabling. Automated timetabling is a popular topic among researchers and practitioners because manual timetable construction is impractical, if not impossible, as it is known to be NP-hard.rnrnA two-stage approach is investigated. The ﬁrst stage involves ﬁnding feasible solutions. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is utilized in this stage. As far as we are aware, it is used for the ﬁrst time in addressing the timetabling problem. It is a relatively new search method and has achieved breakthrough in the domain of games particularly Go. Several enhancements are attempted on MCTS such as heuristic based simulations and pruning. We also compare the eﬀectiveness of MCTS with Graph Coloring Heuristic (GCH) and Tabu Search (TS) based methods. Initial ﬁndings show that a TS based method is more promising, so we focus on improving TS. We propose an algorithm called Tabu Search with Sampling and Perturbation (TSSP). Among the enhancements that we introduced are event sampling, a novel cost function and perturbation. Furthermore, we hybridize TSSP with Iterated Local Search (ILS).rnrnThe second stage focuses on improving the quality of feasible solutions. We propose a variant of Simulated Annealing called Simulated Annealing with Reheating (SAR). SAR has three features: a novel neighborhood examination scheme, a new way of estimating local optima and a reheating scheme. The rigorous setting of initial and end temperature in conventional SA is bypassed in SAR. Precisely, reheating and cooling were applied at the right time and level, thus saving time allowing the search to be performed eﬃciently. One drawback of SAR is having to preset the composition of neighborhood structures for the datasets. We present an enhanced variant of the SAR algorithm called Simulated Annealing with Improved Reheating and Learning (SAIRL). We propose a reinforcement learning based method to obtain a suitable neighborhood structure composition for the search to operate eﬀectively. We also propose to incorporate the average cost changes into the reheated temperature function. SAIRL eliminates the need for tuning parameters in conventional SA as well as neighborhood structures composition in SAR.rnrnExperiments were tested on four publicly available datasets namely Socha, International Timetabling Competition 2002 (ITC02), International Timetabling Competition 2007 (ITC07) and Hard. Our results are better or competitive when compared with other state of the art methods where new best results are obtained for many instances.	local search (optimization);monte carlo method;monte carlo tree search	Say Leng Goh	2017			local optimum;tabu search;iterated local search;mathematical optimization;local search (optimization);reinforcement learning;simulated annealing;heuristic;monte carlo tree search;computer science	AI	23.617498843160025	-0.8712163147656287	163195

We conjecture that a surface generated by SVM could provide a good approximation of the efficient set. As the efficient set is learned at a single SVM implementation by using a group of seeds that symbolize efficient and dominated solutions. To be able to observe whether learning the efficient set via SVMs might have practical implications, we incorporate the SVM-induced efficient set into a GA as a fitness function. We implement our SVM-guided GA on the multiple objective knapsack and assignment problems. We observe that using SVM improves the performance of the GA compared to a benchmark distance based fitness function and may provide competitive results. Our approach is a general one and can be applied to any MODO problem with any number of objective functions.	approximation;benchmark (computing);discrete optimization;fitness function;mathematical optimization;program optimization;software release life cycle;support vector machine	Hong-Zhen Zheng;Xiaodong Zhang;Hao-Yan Guo	2009	2009 Sixth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/FSKD.2009.15	discrete optimization;support vector machine;mathematical optimization;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;evolutionary computation	ML	24.24729421915628	-1.794290058520201	164324

As a result, a plethora of methods and algorithms have been developed to address specific scenarios or problems. A review of the methods and algorithms that have been developed to examine the area of construction schedule optimization (CSO) is undertaken. The developed algorithms for solving the CSO problem can be classified into three methods: mathematical, heuristic and metaheuristic. The application of these methods to various scheduling problems is discussed and implications for future research are identified.

Inspired from a pair of reciprocal operators (pointer and address-of) in computer programming language, a novel pointerbased discrete differential evolution (PDDE) is presented in this paper. Making use of the permutation of integers as the individual representation, PDDE redefines the addition and subtraction operations of traditional DE to construct discrete mutation operator. In addition, the scaling factor and crossover probability factor are redefined to fit the discrete operation. The performance of PDDE is evaluated through extensively experiments on comparing general searching ability and solving resource-constrained project scheduling problem.

In dividing the tasks, we propose problem decomposition, and the use of GAs as the solution approach. In this paper, we consider problems with block angular structures with or without overlapping variables. We decompose not only the problem but also appropriately the chromosome for different components of the problem. We also design a communication process for exchanging information between the components. The approach can be implemented for solving large scale optimization problems using parallel machines. A number of test problems have been solved to demonstrate the use of the proposed approach. The results are very encouraging.	optimization problem;problem solving	Ehab Z. Elfeky;Ruhul A.

Some conventional deterministic methods and exhaustive algorithms are applied to small-scale TSP; whereas, heuristic algorithms are more advantageous for the large-scale TSP. Inspired by the behavior of honey bee swarm, Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithms have been developed as potential optimization approaches and performed well in solving scientific researches and engineering applications. This paper proposes two efficient ABC algorithms with heuristic swap operators (i.e., ABC-HS1 and ABC-HS2) for TSP, which are used to search its better tour solutions. A series of numerical experiments are arranged between the proposed two ABC algorithms and the other three ABC algorithms for TSP. Experimental results demonstrate that ABC-HS1 and ABC-HS2 are both effective and efficient optimization methods.	artificial bee colony algorithm;heuristic;travelling salesman problem	Zhonghua Li;Zijing Zhou;Xuedong Sun;Dongliang Guo	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39482-9_26	mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;artificial bee colony algorithm;travelling salesman problem;metaheuristic	EDA	23.566472140572703	0.6528991129231904	165247
f5dcdde58b6472b4335f4ed81fc22abed7018536	division of road traffic network based on genetic algorithm and graph coarsening		In this paper, an efficient method for road traffic network division is described. The method is based on the dividing genetic algorithm and utilizes graph coarsening to improve its results. The main idea is to coarse the original road traffic network to obtain a smaller (i.e., coarser) network. This coarser network can be optimally divided and this division can be projected to the original network. Using the coarsening (based on geographical positions of the crossroads), the division method is faster and yields better road traffic network divisions. This is demonstrated directly on a distributed road traffic simulation, for which the division of road traffic network is performed.	genetic algorithm;simulation	Tomas Potuzak	2018	2018 11th International Conference on Human System Interaction (HSI)	10.1109/HSI.2018.8431334	genetic algorithm;division (mathematics);computer science;distributed computing;traffic simulation;graph	Robotics	17.697279414424138	-0.25803352003630414	165259

The formulation of the JSP is based on the assumption that for each part type or job there is only one process plan that prescribes the sequence of operations and the machine on which each operation has to be performed. Flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is an extension of the JSP, which allows an operation to be processed by any machine from a given set. Since FJSP requires an additional decision of machine allocation during scheduling, therefore it is much more complex problem than JSP. To solve such NP-hard problems, heuristic approaches are commonly preferred over the traditional mathematical techniques. This paper proposes a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based heuristic for solving the FJSP for minimum makespan time criterion. The performance of the proposed PSO is evaluated by comparing its results with the results obtained using ILOG Solver, a constraint-programming tool. The comparison of the results proves the effectiveness of the proposed PSO for solving FJSP instances.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);coalition for patent fairness;constraint programming;feasible region;heuristic;ilog;job shop scheduling;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;np-hardness;open programming language (opl);particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;programming tool;scheduling (computing);simulated annealing;solver;tabu search	B.

TTP is the problem of scheduling a feasible double round robin tournament that minimizes the total distances traveled by the teams. The proposed E-GA for TTP uses a new crossover operator based on sharing the best partial path teams among the schedules. Further, E-GA uses a variable neighborhood search as a subroutine to improve the intensification mechanism in GA. The proposed method is evaluated on publicly available standard benchmarks and compared with other techniques for TTP. The computational experiment shows that the proposed method could build interesting results comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches.	benchmark (computing);crossover (genetic algorithm);diversification (finance);evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;heuristic (computer science);kiva;local search (optimization);np-hardness;scheduling (computing);subroutine;traveling tournament problem;trusted third party;variable neighborhood search;whole earth 'lectronic link	Meriem Khelifa;Dalila Boughaci;Esma Aïmeur	2017	2017 4th International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)	10.1109/CoDIT.2017.8102741	operator (computer programming);subroutine;genetic algorithm;tournament;crossover;variable neighborhood search;scheduling (computing);mathematical optimization;schedule;mathematics	Robotics	22.624454828570784	1.0385586541768155	167800

ebfd66df05874718534f429b5eb924cc298b8696	a genetic algorithm based technique for efficient scheduling of tasks on multiprocessor system		Both parallel and distributed network environment systems play a vital role in the improvement of high performance computing. The primary concern when analyzing these systems is multiprocessor task scheduling. This paper addresses the problem of efficient multiprocessor task scheduling. A multiprocessor task scheduling problem is represented as directed acyclic task graph (DAG), for execution on multiprocessors with communication costs. In this paper we have investigated the effectiveness of a proposed paradigm based on genetic algorithms (GAs). GAs is a class of robust stochastic search algorithms for various combinatorial optimization problems. We have designed a GA based encoding mechanism that uses multi-chromosome encoding scheme. The implementation of the technique is simple. The performance of the designed algorithm has been tested on a variety of multiprocessor systems both heterogeneous as well as homogeneous.	combinatorial optimization;directed acyclic graph;genetic algorithm;line code;mathematical optimization;multiprocessing;programming paradigm;scheduling (computing);search algorithm;software release life cycle;stochastic optimization;supercomputer	Poonam Panwar;A.

The parallel GRASP algorithm is applied to the multi-criteria minimum spanning tree problem, which is NP-hard. In this problem, a vector of costs is defined for each edge of the graph and the goal is to find all the efficient or Pareto optimal spanning trees (solutions). Each process finds a subset of efficient solutions. These subsets are joined using different strategies to obtain the final set of efficient solutions. The multi-criteria GRASP algorithm with the different parallel strategies are tested on complete graphs with n = 20, 30 and 50 nodes and r = 2 and 3 criteria. The computational results show that the proposed parallel algorithms reduce the execution time and the results obtained by the sequential version were improved.	computation;file spanning;grasp;greedy algorithm;greedy randomized adaptive search procedure;metaheuristic;minimum spanning tree;np-hardness;parallel algorithm;parallel computing;pareto efficiency;randomized algorithm;run time (program lifecycle phase);search problem	Dalessandro Soares Vianna;José Elias Claudio Arroyo;Pedro Sampaio Vieira;Thiago Ribeiro de Azeredo	2005	XXV International Conference of the Chilean Computer Science Society (SCCC'05)	10.1109/SCCC.2005.1587873	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;kruskal's algorithm;machine learning;mathematics;reverse-delete algorithm	Robotics	22.510378929320648	1.9073913469808184	170378

The aim is to design districts by amalgamating edges of a graph as opposed to cells. Solutions must satisfy two hard criteria (complete and exclusive assignment as well as connectedness) and several soft criteria (balance, small deadheading, local compactness, and global compactness). The latter criteria are amalgamated into a weighted objective. The proposed heuristic applies a construction procedure followed by a tabu search improvement phase in which several subroutines are defined and selected according to a roulette wheel mechanism, as in adaptive large neighborhood search. Extensive tests conducted on instances derived from real-world street data confirm the efficiency of the proposed methodology.	approximation algorithm;arc routing;heuristic;local search (optimization);pareto efficiency;tabu search	Alexander Butsch;Jörg Kalcsics;Gilbert Laporte	2014	INFORMS Journal on Computing	10.1287/ijoc.2014.0600	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;tabu search;computer science;mathematics	ECom	18.407221227287025	2.5610109884676886	171707

Iterated Local Search (ILS) is a well-known approach for discrete optimization, combining perturbation and hill-climbing within an iterative framework. In this study, we introduce an ILS approach, strengthened by a hyper-heuristic which generates heuristics based on a fixed number of add and delete operations. The performance of the proposed hyperheuristic is tested across two different problem domains using real world benchmark of course timetabling instances from the second International Timetabling Competition Tracks 2 and 3. The results show that mixing add and delete operations within an ILS framework yields an effective hyperheuristic approach.	benchmark (computing);discrete optimization;heuristic (computer science);high- and low-level;hill climbing;hyper-heuristic;iterated function;iterated local search;iterative method;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;problem domain	Jorge Alberto Soria-Alcaraz;Ender Özcan;Jerry Swan;Graham Kendall;Juan Martín Carpio Valadez	2016	Appl.

3e6fbc736594600ba813ad88a732146be8c9c26a	tuning parameters of large neighborhood search for the machine reassignment problem		Data centers are a critical and ubiquitous resource for providing infrastructure for banking, Internet and electronic commerce. One way of managing the data centers efficiently is to minimize a cost function that takes into account the load of the machines, the balance among a set of available resources of the machines, and the costs of moving processes while respecting a set of constraints. This problem is called machine reassignment problem. An instance of this online problem can have several tens of thousands of processes. Therefore, the challenge is to solve a very large size instance in a very limited time. In this paper, we describe a constraint programming based Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) approach for solving this problem. The values of the parameters of LNS can have a significant impact on the performance of LNS when solving an instance. We, therefore, employ the Instance Specific Algorithm Configuration methodology, where a clustering of the instances is maintained in the offline phase and the parameters of LNS are automatically tuned for each cluster. When a new instance arrives the values of the parameters of the closest cluster are used for solving the instance in the online phase. Results confirm that our CP-based LNS approach with high quality parameter settings finds good quality solutions for very large size instances in very limited time. Our results also significantly outperform the hand-tuned settings of the parameters selected by a human expert.	anytime algorithm;cluster analysis;computational resource;constraint programming;data center;display resolution;e-commerce;internet;logarithmic number system;loss function;online algorithm;online and offline;scalability;solver	Yuri Malitsky;Deepak Mehta;Barry O'Sullivan;Helmut Simonis	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-38171-3_12	machine learning;mathematical optimization;constraint programming;cluster analysis;the internet;computer science;artificial intelligence	AI	20.342815589477777	3.7346372283726317	173057
d31fb1829cc415218b286d0d6caa7a8554eac549	structural analysis of combinatorial optimization problem characteristics and their resolution using hybrid approaches		Many combinatorial problems coming from the real world may not have a clear and well defined structure, typically being dirtied by side constraints, or being composed of two or more sub-problems, usually not disjoint. Such problems are not suitable to be solved with pure approaches based on a single programming paradigm, because a paradigm that can effectively face a problem characteristic may behave inefficiently when facing other characteristics. In these cases, modelling the problem using different programming techniques, trying to ”take the best” from each technique, can produce solvers that largely dominate pure approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of hybridization and we discuss about different hybridization techniques by analyzing two classes of problems with particular structures, exploiting Constraint Programming and Integer Linear Programming solving tools and Algorithm Portfolios and Logic Based Benders Decomposition as integration and hybridization frameworks.	algorithm;benders decomposition;combinatorial optimization;constraint programming;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;programming paradigm;structural analysis	Alessio Guerri	2007			mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics;algorithm	AI	24.337926719688767	3.508460071643807	173330

In many cases, for solving these problems it is necessary the use of meta-heuristics. An important problem in communication networks is the Terminal Assignment Problem (TAP). Our goal is to minimise the link cost of large balanced communication networks. TAP is a NP-Hard problem. The intractability of this problem is the motivation for the pursuits of Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms that produce approximate, rather than exact, solutions. This paper makes a comparison among the effectiveness of three SI algorithms: Ant Colony Optimisation, Discrete Particle Swarm Optimisation and Artificial Bee Colony. We also compare the SI algorithms with several algorithms from literature. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The results show that SI algorithms provide good solutions in a better running time.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;swarm;telecommunications network	Eugénia Moreira Bernardino;Anabela Moreira Bernardino;Juan M.

fe82f22632a1809ab296ee25011654aaa6bb395f	a relation of dominance for the bicriterion bus routing problem		A bicriterion bus routing (BBR) problem is described and analysed. The objective is to find a route from the start stop to the final stop minimizing the time and the cost of travel simultaneously. Additionally, the time of starting travel at the start stop is given. The BBR problem can be resolved using methods of graph theory. It comes down to resolving a bicriterion shortest path (BSP) problem in a multigraph with variable weights. In the paper, differences between the problem with constant weights and that with variable weights are described and analysed, with particular emphasis on properties satisfied only for the problem with variable weights and the description of the influence of dominated partial solutions on non-dominated final solutions. This paper proposes methods of estimation a dominated partial solution for the possibility of obtaining a non-dominated final solution from it. An algorithm for solving the BBR problem implementing these estimation methods is proposed and the results of experimental tests are presented.	algorithm;behavior-based robotics;best, worst and average case;bus network;download;graph theory;multigraph;np-completeness;routing;run time (program lifecycle phase);shortest path problem;time complexity	Jacek Widuch	2017	Applied Mathematics and Computer Science	10.1515/amcs-2017-0010	real-time computing;distributed computing;transport engineering	ML	18.06183463468343	2.2886577515125364	174378

We propose variants of the GRASP metaheuristic that incorporate memorybased mechanisms for solving this problem. There are two mechanisms proposed in the literature that utilize a long-term memory composed of an elite set of high quality and sufficiently distant solutions. The first mechanism consists of extracting attributes from the elite solutions in order to influence the construction of an initial solution. The second one makes use of path relinking to connect a GRASP local minimum with a solution of the elite set, and also to connect solutions from the elite set. Reactive GRASP, which probabilistically determines the degree of randomness in the GRASP construction throughout the iterations, is also investigated. Computational tests for instances involving up to 150 jobs are reported, and the proposed method is compared with heuristic and exact methods from the literature.	computation;display resolution;diversification (finance);experiment;grasp;global motion compensation;greedy algorithm;heuristic;information source;iteration;job stream;kriging;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;metaheuristic;neighbourhood (graph theory);point process;randomness;scheduling (computing);secure socket tunneling protocol;single-machine scheduling;springer (tank)	Vinícius Amaral Armentano;Olinto César Bassi de Araújo	2006	J.

5bf4c4917e9b0df39b9c693c5ef1a0078b580dfe	solving a multi-objective master planning problem with substitution and a recycling process for a capacitated multi-commodity supply chain network	master planning;recycle process;recycling penalty;multiple goal optimization;advanced planning and scheduling;substitutions;supply chain management;heuristic algorithm	This study focuses on solving the multi-objective master planning problem for supply chains by considering product structures with multiple final products using substitutions, common components, and recycled components. This study considers five objectives in the planning process: (1) minimizing the delay cost, (2) minimizing the substitution priority, (3) minimizing the recycling penalty, (4) minimizing the substitution cost, and (5) minimizing the cost of production, processing, inventory holding and transportation. This study proposes a heuristic algorithm, called the GA-based Master Planning Algorithm (GAMPA), to solve the supply-chain master planning problem efficiently and effectively. GAMPA first transforms the closed-loop supply chain into an open-loop supply chain that plans and searches the sub-networks for each final product. GAMPA then uses a genetic algorithm to sort and sequence the demands. GAMPA selects the chromosome that generates the best planning result according to the priority of the objectives. GAMPA plans each demand sequentially according to the selected chromosome and a randomly-selected production tree. GAMPA tries different production trees for each demand and selects the best planning result at the end. To show the effectiveness and efficiency of GAMPA, a prototype was constructed and tested using complexity analysis and computational analysis to demonstrate the power of GAMPA.	supply chain network	Ching-Chin Chern;Seak-Tou Lei;Kwei-Long Huang	2014	J.

The article on the other hand presents an integrated system for the resolution of problems under multiple objectives, combining both aspects. A method base of metaheuristics is made available for the identification of optimal alternatives of machine scheduling problems, and the selection of a most preferred solution is supported in an interactive decision making procedure. As the system is aimed at end users, a graphical interface allows the easy adaptation of metaheuristic techniques. Contrary to existing software class libraries, the system therefore enables users with little or no knowledge in the mentioned areas to successfully solve scheduling problems and customize and test metaheuristics.

It was first introduced for solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem. Since then many implementations of ACO have been proposed for a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. In this chapter, ACO is applied to the Vehicle Routing Problem with Pickups and Deliveries (VRPPD). VRPPD determines a set of vehicle routes originating and ending at a single depot and visiting all customers exactly once. The vehicles are not only required to deliver goods but also to pick up some goods from the customers. The objective is to minimize the total distance traversed. The chapter first provides an overview of the ACO approach. Next, VRPPD is described and the related literature is reviewed. Then, an ACO approach for VRPPD is presented. The approach proposes a new visibility function which attempts to capture the “delivery” and “pickup” nature of the problem. The performance of the approach is tested using well-known benchmark problems from the literature.	ant colony optimization algorithms;approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);central processing unit;combinatorial optimization;computation;computational complexity theory;heuristic (computer science);local search (optimization);logistics;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;population;regular expression;relevance;travelling salesman problem;vehicle routing problem	Bülent Çatay	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04039-9_9	optimization problem;mathematical optimization;simulation;engineering;operations management;vehicle routing problem;metaheuristic	AI	17.873183610705688	2.082933492960334	175988

It gives project planners both challenges and opportunities to work out the best plan that optimizes time and cost to complete a project. In this paper, we present a novel method which examines the effects of project uncertainties on both, the duration as well as the cost of the activities. This method integrates a fuzzy logic framework with Hybrid Meta-Heuristic. Hybrid Meta-Heuristic (HMH) is an innovative approach which hybridizes a multiobjective genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. Integration of HMH and fuzzy logic is referred to as ‘integrated Fuzzy–HMH’. A rule based fuzzy logic framework brings up changes in the duration uzzy logic ime–cost tradeoff and the cost of each activity for the input uncertainties and HMH searches for Pareto-optimal front (TCT profile) for a given set of time–cost pair of each project activity. Two standard test problems from the literature are attempted using HMH. A case study of TCT problem is solved using integrated Fuzzy–HMH. The method solves time–cost tradeoff problems within an uncertain environment and carries out its sensitivity analysis. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) is the class of heuristic investigated. Results demonstrate that for a given instance size, an increase in the standard deviation of the cost matrix of instances results in an increase in the difficulty of the instances. This implies that for ACO, it is insufficient to report results on problems classified only by problem size, as has been commonly done in most ACO research to date. Some description of the cost matrix distribution is also required when attempting to explain and predict the performance of these algorithms on the TSP.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;ant colony optimization algorithms;combinatorial optimization;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;travelling salesman problem	Enda Ridge;Daniel Kudenko	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-71615-0_18	mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics	AI	22.745504445447768	0.7521132825033225	176399

Generally, order batching is effective in reducing the total travel distance of order picking. However, how to realize order batching is an NP-hard problem. It is difficult to find the optimal solution of order batching in polynomial time. Some deterministic methods are applied to small-scale order batching problems; while some heuristic algorithms are potential for large-scale order batching problems. Inspired by the behaviors of honey bee swarms, artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms have been developed as potential computational approaches and performed well in scientific researches and engineering applications. To minimize the total travel distance of order picking, this paper proposes an effective batching method based on an artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC-BM). A series of numerical simulation experiments about order batching are arranged. Compared to GA-BM, the proposed ABC-BM algorithm is more efficient in optimizing different-scale order picking problems.	abc (stream cipher);artificial bee colony algorithm;computer simulation;experiment;genetic algorithm;heuristic;np-hardness;numerical analysis;particle swarm optimization;software release life cycle;time complexity	Zhonghua Li;Zijing Zhou	2013	2013 Ninth International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC)	10.1109/ICNC.2013.6818006	mathematical optimization;engineering;artificial intelligence;operations management	Robotics	20.701721599086405	0.9055533994256818	177436

Incorporating fuzzy sets and genetic operators, a novel ant colony optimization algorithm is developed for the problem. In the proposed algorithm, artificial ants construct solutions as orders of jobs based on the heuristic information as well as pheromone trails. To calculate the heuristic information, three well-known priority rules are adopted as fuzzy sets and then aggregated. When all artificial ants have terminated their constructions, genetic operators such as crossover and mutation are applied to generate new regions of the solution space. A local search is then performed to improve the performance quality of some of the solutions found. Moreover, at run-time the pheromone trails are locally as well as globally updated, and limited between lower and upper bounds.

e3ea84aec8e9d47467a2352be4e4cc976f95093c	a novel hybrid algorithm for solving continuous single-objective defensive location problem		The continuous defensive location problem (CDLP) is an NP-hard problem well investigated in the fields of competitive facility location. CDLP is a bi-level programming problem, where a decision maker locates defensive facilities with different capacities in the vertices of the network in order to avoid her/his aggressors from reaching core which is an important vertex in the network. In the present research, a hybrid method combining the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) and BFGS algorithm is presented to solve the CDLP. The proposed hybrid method integrates the ICA and the BFGS algorithm, providing a highly near-optimal solution. The upper-level problem solves the optimal location of defense facilities, and hybrid algorithm is applied. The lower-level problem is the shortest path problem which is solved by the Dijkstra method. The feasibility of the proposed hybrid method is demonstrated for a number of small, medium and large instances of the problem. The test results are compared with those obtained by genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and ICA in terms of solution accuracy and required CPU time. Simulation results reveal that the proposed hybrid method is feasible, robust and more effective in solving the CDLP than conventional metaheuristic methods.	black and burst;broyden–fletcher–goldfarb–shanno algorithm;cable modem;central processing unit;dijkstra's algorithm;genetic algorithm;hybrid algorithm;imperialist competitive algorithm;independent computing architecture;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;np-hardness;particle swarm optimization;shortest path problem;simulation	Hamid Reza Maleki;Raheleh Khanduzi;Reza Akbari	2016	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-016-2254-3	mathematical optimization;machine learning;mathematics;algorithm	AI	18.112370277280004	2.619334134684713	177611

One of the most common used ways to solve the problem is the trial and error procedure. In the recent few years, a number of adaptive versions of every evolutionary and nature inspired algorithm have been presented in order to avoid the use of a predefined set of parameters for all instances of the studied problem. In this paper, an adaptive version of the BBMO algorithm is proposed, where initially random values are given to each one of the parameters and, then, these parameters are adapted during the optimization process. The proposed Adaptive BBMO algorithm is used for the solution of the Multicast Routing Problem (MRP). As we would like to prove that the proposed algorithm is suitable for solving different kinds of combinatorial optimization problems we test the algorithm, also, in the Probabilistic Traveling Salesman Problem (PTSP) and in the Hierarchical Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem (HPFSP). Finally, the algorithm is tested in four classic benchmark functions for global optimization problems (Rosenbrock, Sphere, Rastrigin and Griewank) in order to prove the generality of the procedure. A number of benchmark instances for all problems are tested using the proposed algorithm in order to prove its effectiveness.	adaptive filter;algorithm	Yannis Marinakis;Magdalene Marinaki;Athanasios Migdalas	2017	Appl.

Our goal was devising new algorithms to reach either optimal schedules for moderate size instances or sub-optimal schedules for larger ones. We considered two different objective functions, designed new heuristics estimations and studied the formal properties of them. The main contribution is the formulation of an efficient pruning method based on dominance relations among states of the search space. This method reduces drastically the effective search space and can be adapted in principle to any regular objective function. The experimental study shows that the proposed method is quite competitive with other state-of-the-art methods in reaching both optimal and sub-optimal schedules.	experiment;heuristic (computer science);job shop scheduling;loss function;optimization problem;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);search algorithm;state space	María R.

The FJSP is an NP-hard problem consisting of two sub-problems, which are the machine assignment and the operation scheduling problems. In this paper, we propose how to solve the FJSP by metaheuristics based on clustering in a holonic multiagent model. Firstly, a Neighborhood-based Genetic Algorithm (NGA) is applied by a scheduler agent for a global exploration of the search space. Secondly, a local search technique is used by a set of cluster agents to guide the research in promising regions of the search space and to improve the quality of the NGA final population. To evaluate our approach, numerical tests are made based on three sets of well known benchmark instances from the literature of the FJSP, which are Kacem, Brandimarte, Hurink. The experimental results show the efficiency of our approach in comparison to other approaches.	agent-based model;benchmark (computing);cluster analysis;genetic algorithm;holon (philosophy);job shop scheduling;local search (optimization);metaheuristic;np-hardness;next-generation access;numerical analysis;scheduling (computing)	Houssem Eddine Nouri;Olfa Belkahla Driss;Khaled Ghédira	2015		10.1145/2739482.2768449	job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;flow shop scheduling;computer science;operations management;machine learning	AI	21.62621837731912	-0.744648945666327	181642

The problem consists of migrating nodes from a former network to a new one affording the required services. The migration procedure needs the installation of a bridge between the two networks without disrupting current services. Nodes are moved sequentially one by one. Our objective is to minimize the cost of the required bridge. We describe an enhanced genetic algorithm based on a good initial population.

e252ed15eb6bd7b4c7eb7d5c5ae5cebe33c27f42	considerations on 2d-bin packing problem: is the order of placement a relevant factor?		The problem of packing a given sequence of items of 2-dimensional (2D) geometric shapes into a minimum number of rectangle bins of given dimensions is called the 2D bin packing problem. This problem has various applications across many industries such as steel-, paperand woodindustries where objects of certain shapes are needed to be cut from large rectangle panels with the most efficient use of materials. This problem, however, belongs to the class of NP-Hard problems, implying that no perfect solution exists. Many proposed solutions involve the use of advanced metaheuristic search techniques such as Local Search, Simulated Annealing or Genetic Algorithm, but most of them are still greedy-based, which means some greedy technique such as First-Fit is still used as their core placement algorithm and optimization techniques are employed only to search for a good ordering or orientation (rotation angles) of the objects so that the placement procedure can yield the best possible results. Practice has shown that greedy placement algorithm on the simple area decreasing order can produce excellent results comparable to those on orderings generated from advanced optimization techniques. This paper discusses the relevance of the order of placement in the 2D bin packing problem.	bin packing problem;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;genetic algorithm;greedy algorithm;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;np-hardness;one-to-one (data model);relevance;set packing;simulated annealing	Gia Thuan Lam;Viet Anh Ho;Doina Logofatu	2017		10.5220/0006440302800287	mathematical optimization;computer science;bin packing problem	DB	19.761857632175232	3.4257617355080847	182990

Y. Wang's classic bottom-up two-dimensional cutting stock algorithm generates cutting patterns by building rectangles both horizontally and vertically. This algorithm uses a parameter β1 to tradeoff the number of rectangles generated by the algorithm and hence the quality of the cutting pattern solution obtained versus the amount of computer resources required. Several researchers have made relatively straightforward modifications to Wang's basic algorithm resulting in improved computational times. However, even with these modifications, Wang's approach tends to require large amounts of computer resources in order to optimally or near-optimally solve difficult two-dimensional guillotine cutting stock problems. In this paper, we present an iterative approach that judiciously uses Wang's basic algorithm (with some previously defined modifications) to obtain optimal cutting patterns to difficult two-dimensional cutting stock problems in reasonable computer run times.	algorithm	Francis J.

A hybrid grouping genetic algorithm called HGGA-BP is proposed to solve BPP. The proposed algorithm is inspired by the Falkenauer grouping encoding scheme, which applies evolutionary operators at the bin level. HGGA-BP includes efficient heuristics to generate the initial population and performs mutation and crossover for groups as well as hybrid strategies for the arrangement of objects that were released by the group operators. The effectiveness of the algorithm is comparable with the best state-of-the-art algorithms, outperforming the published results for the class of instances hard28, which has shown the highest difficulty for algorithms that solve BPP.	bpp (complexity);bin packing problem;computational anatomy;genetic algorithm;heuristic (computer science);line code;set packing	Laura Cruz Reyes;Marcela Quiroz-Castellanos;Adriana C.

b9c7dedde4e24481087545fb87929d91bdfac774	large-scale vehicle routing problems: quantum annealing, tunings and results		Quantum Annealing was previously applied to the vehicle routing problem and the results were promising. For all benchmark instances in the study, optimal results were obtained. However, 100% success rate was not achieved in every case, and tuning the control parameters for larger instances proved cumbersome. This work addresses these remaining difficulties. An empirical approach is taken wherein measurements of run-time behaviour are exploited to transform existing good values of control parameters so that they can be used successfully for other problem instances. The course of this work shows a method which simplifies hand-tuning so that the heuristic performs successfully when applied to larger instances, and also demonstrates a tuning method which establishes control parameter values for instances which belong in broadly defined groupings. In addition, new best known solutions for large-scale instances, and initial results for the distance-constrained variant of the vehicle routing problem are presented. © 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd. e t p o s c I e I t a b i T e d c t m m i n	benchmark (computing);heuristic;quantum annealing;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulated annealing;vehicle routing problem	Alex Syrichas;Alan Crispin	2017	Computers & OR	10.1016/j.cor.2017.05.014	mathematical optimization;computer science;machine learning	Logic	22.80971822199682	-2.5948122617576	183764

4907103479d7416bf0f092725bef18e7c9d82d61	dynamic polynomial watchdog encoding for solving weighted maxsat		In this paper we present a novel pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraint encoding for solving the weighted MaxSAT problem with iterative SAT-based methods based on the Polynomial Watchdog (PW) CNF encoding. The watchdog of the PW encoding indicates whether the bound of the PB constraint holds. In our approach, we lift this static watchdog concept to a dynamic one allowing an incremental convergence to the optimal result. Consequently, we formulate and implement a SAT-based algorithm for our new Dynamic Polynomial Watchdog (DPW) encoding which can be applied for solving the MaxSAT problem. Furthermore, we introduce three fundamental optimizations of the PW encoding also suited for the original version leading to significantly less encoding size. Our experimental results show that our encoding and algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art encodings as utilized in QMaxSAT (2nd place in last MaxSAT Evaluation 2017). Our encoding dominates two of the QMaxSAT encodings, and at the same time is able to solve unique instances. We integrated our new encoding into QMaxSAT and adapt the heuristic to choose between the only remaining encoding of QMaxSAT and our approach. This combined version solves 19 (4%) more instances in overall 30% less run time on the benchmark set of the MaxSAT Evaluation 2017. Compared to each encoding of QMaxSAT used in the evaluation, our encoding leads to an algorithm that is on average at least 2X faster.	maximum satisfiability problem;polynomial;watchdog timer	Tobias Paxian;Sven Reimer;Bernd Becker	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-94144-8_3	discrete mathematics;maximum satisfiability problem;encoding (memory);heuristic;computer science;polynomial;convergence (routing)	AI	21.93438566279878	4.174335826326572	184998

In the proposed algorithm, a local search procedure is applied to each solution (i.e., each individual) generated by genetic operations. Our algorithm uses a weighted sum of multiple objectives as a fitness function. The fitness function is utilized when a pair of parent solutions are selected for generating a new solution by crossover and mutation operations. A local search procedure is applied to the new solution to maximize its fitness value. One characteristic feature of our algorithm is to randomly specify weight values whenever a pair of parent solutions are selected. That is, each selection (i.e., the selection of two parent solutions) is performed by a different weight vector. Another characteristic feature of our algorithm is not to examine all neighborhood solutions of a current solution in the local search procedure. Only a small number of neighborhood solutions are examined to prevent the local search procedure from spending almost all available computation time in our algorithm. High performance of our algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to multi-objective flowshop scheduling problems.	computation;crossover (genetic algorithm);fitness function;hybrid algorithm;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem;randomness;scheduling (computing);search algorithm;time complexity;vector graphics;weight function	Hisao Ishibuchi;Tadahiko Murata	1998	IEEE Trans.

In this paper a binary artificial bee colony (BABC) algorithm is developed for binary integer job scheduling problems in grid computing. We further propose an efficient binary artificial bee colony extension of BABC that incorporates a flexible ranking strategy (FRS) to improve the balance between exploration and exploitation. The FRS is introduced to generate and use new solutions for diversified search in early generations and to speed up convergence in latter generations. Two variants are introduced to minimize the makepsan. In the first a fixed number of best solutions is employed with the FRS while in the second the number of the best solutions is reduced with each new generation. Simulation results for benchmark job scheduling problems show that the performance of our proposed methods is better than those alternatives such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization.	artificial bee colony algorithm;bees algorithm;benchmark (computing);genetic algorithm;grid computing;job scheduler;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;scheduling (computing);simulated annealing;simulation;vergence	Sung-Soo Kim;Ji-Hwan Byeon;Hongbo Liu;Ajith Abraham;Se&#x00E1;n McLoone	2013	Soft Comput.	10.1007/s00500-012-0957-7	mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;job scheduler;artificial bee colony algorithm;grid computing;metaheuristic	HPC	24.280655282370603	-1.468335720933832	186075

The design optimization of laminated composite plates being a combinatorially explosive constrained non-linear optimization problem (CNOP), with many design variables and a vast solution space, warrants the use of nonparametric and heuristic optimization algorithms like PSO. Optimization requires minimizing both the weight and cost of these composite plates, simultaneously, which renders the problem multi-objective. Hence VEPSO, a multi-objective variant of the PSO algorithm, is used. Despite the use of such a heuristic, the application problem, being computationally intensive, suffers from long execution times due to sequential computation. Hence, a parallel version of the PSO algorithm for the problem has been developed to run on several nodes of an IBM P720 cluster. The proposed parallel algorithm, using MPI’s collective communication directives, establishes a peer-to-peer relationship between the constituent parallel processes, deviating from the more common master-slave approach, in achieving reduction of computation time by factor of up to 10. Finally we show the effectiveness of the proposed parallel algorithm by comparing it with a serial implementation of VEPSO and a parallel implementation of the vector evaluated genetic algorithm (VEGA) for the same design problem. & 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Their performance depends heavily on the setting of the GA parameters that control execution, and on the types and probabilities of application of the genetic operators. In the context of optimal choice of the above factors, the authors previously proposed the elite degree as a measure of individuals latent fitness; this measure was then employed to develop a new GA allowing adaptive selection among crossover options. In this study, the previous definition of elite degree is revised; using the new definition, a GA is developed to support adaptive adjustment of mutation probability.

Compared with the static algorithms, dynamic scheduling algorithms can better fulfill the requirements in real situations. Considering that both flexibility and fuzzy processing time are common in reality, this paper focuses on the dynamic flexible job-shop scheduling problem with fuzzy processing time (DfFJSP). By adopting a series of transforming procedures, the original DfFJSP is simplified as a traditional static fuzzy flexible job-shop problem, which is more suitable to take advantage of the existing algorithms. In this paper, estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is brought into address the post-transforming problem. An improved EDA is developed through making use of several elements omitted in original EDA, including the historical-optimal solution and the standardized solution vectors. The improved algorithm is named as fast estimation of distribution algorithm (fEDA) since it performs better in convergence speed and computation precision, compared with the original EDA. To sum up, the ingenious transformation and the effective fEDA algorithm provide an efficient and practical way to tackle the dynamic flexible fuzzy job-shop scheduling problem. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A constructive heuristic is first presented to generate a good initial solution by combining the existing profile fitting (PF) approach and Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic in an effective way. Then, a memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed including effective techniques like a heuristic-based initialization, a path-relinking-based crossover operator, a referenced local search, and a procedure to control the diversity of the population. Afterwards, the parameters and operators of the proposed MA are calibrated by means of a design of experiments approach. Finally, a comparative evaluation is carried out with the best performing algorithms presented for the blocking flowshop with makespan criterion, and with the adaptations of other state-of-the-art MAs originally designed for the regular flowshop problem. The results show that the proposed MA performs much better than the other algorithms. Ultimately, 75 out of 120 upper bounds provided by Ribas [“An iterated greedy algorithm for the flowshop scheduling with blocking”, OMEGA, vol. 39, pp. 293-301, 2011.] for Taillard flowshop benchmarks that are considered as blocking flowshop instances are further improved by the presented MA.	blocking (computing);combinatorial optimization;computation;constructive heuristic;design of experiments;display resolution;experiment;genetic algorithm;greedy algorithm;hold-and-modify;iteration;local search (optimization);makespan;mathematical optimization;memetic algorithm;memetics;requirement;scheduling (computing);venue (sound system)	Quan-Ke Pan;Ling Wang;Hongyan Sang;Junqing Li;Min Liu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/TASE.2012.2219860	mathematical optimization;greedy algorithm;flow shop scheduling;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;iterative method	AI	22.07161217468168	-0.09925574530741622	188223

SLS has been traditionally associated with satisfiability solving, that is, finding a solution for a given problem instance, as their intrinsic nature does not address unsatisfiable problems. Unsatisfiable instances were therefore commonly solved using backtrack search solvers. For this reason, in the late 90s Selman, Kautz and McAllester proposed a challenge to use local search instead to prove unsatisfiability. More recently, two SLS solvers – RANGER and GUNSAT – have been developed, which are able to prove unsatisfiability albeit being SLS solvers. In this paper, we first compare RANGER with GUNSAT and then propose to improve RANGER performance using some of GUNSAT’s techniques, namely unit propagation look-ahead and extended resolution.	backtracking;bart selman;heuristic;local search (optimization);software propagation;solver;standard sea level;unit propagation;ranger	David Pereira;Inês Lynce;Steven David Prestwich	2009		10.4204/EPTCS.5.4	mathematical optimization;computer science;local search;machine learning;mathematics;algorithm;satisfiability	AI	23.26675929787398	3.6365080251090323	188943

a5adaa1f6d1a5f7b00d976d34d4cb0a46e7fe805	analysis of an off-line intrusion detection system: a case study in multi-objective genetic algorithms	heuristic search;computer security;intrusion detection system	A primary approach to computer security is the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Off-line intrusion detection can be accomplished by searching audit trail logs of user activities for matches to patterns of events required for known attacks. Because such search is NPcomplete, heuristic methods will need to be employed as databases of events and attacks grow. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) can provide appropriate heuristic search methods. However, balancing the need to detect all possible attacks in an audit trail with the need to avoid warnings of attacks that do not exist is a challenge, given the scalar fitness values required by GAs. A case study of a previously proposed GA-based IDS shows this difficulty with respect to its fitness function and proposes a new method to overcome it. Such analysis can be of benefit to the study of other multi-objective GAs. Introduction The need for automated audit trail analysis was outlined a quarter century ago (Anderson 1980) and is still present. This paper presents a case-study of an off-line intrusion detection system that uses GAs to search for matches in the audit trail (Mé 1998). Unfortunately, the parameters for its fitness function cannot be tuned to effectively detect all possible attacks in an audit trail while still avoiding false positives. Our work addresses this shortcoming. GASSATA A Genetic Algorithm as an Alternative Tool for Security Audit Trail Analysis (GASSATA) was introduced as an off-line intrusion detection system (Mé 1998) with fitness function F (I) = α + ∑Na i=1 Wi · Ii − β ∗ T 2 (1) where I is the hypothesis vector, α maintains F (I) > 0 in order to retain diversity in the population (using proportional probability selection), Na is the number of known attacks, W is the weighted vector that reflects the risk of each ∗Conducting research at the Robotics, Evolution, Adaptation, and Learning Laboratory (REAL Lab), School of Computer Science, University of Oklahoma.

All rights reserved. attack, β provides a slope for the penalty function, and T is the number of times for which (AE ·I)i > OVi, where AE is the attack-event matrix that shows which events are required for each attack, and OV is the observed vector of events. Mé (1998) reports good results with GASSATA but our experience has been that the system often generates false positives and negatives (Diaz-Gomez & Hougen 2005). Analysis of GASSATA’S Fitness Function A genetic algorithm needs a scalar fitness function to work, and it appears natural that the one originally proposed (Mé 1998)—a combination of objectives into a single function using arithmetic operations—is appropriate. There are, however, problems with this approach. The first is that accurate scalar information must be provided on the range of objectives, to avoid one of them dominating the other. The second is the difficulty in determining the appropriate weights when there is not enough information about them. In this case, any optimal point obtained will be a function of the coefficients used to combine the objectives (Coello 1998). The term ∑Na i=1 Wi · Ii guides the solution to have the maximum number of intrusions. However, this is good only until the correct set of intrusions are found. If more intrusions than that are hypothesized, the problem of false positives occurs. Similarly, the term β ∗ T 2 decreases the fitness value but various intrusions can require the same event. When this happens, the counting of overestimates is wrong. See Figure 1. In 1 we have a first case: A type 5 intrusion was hypothesized, so one is added. This intrusion requires events 6, 7, and 17. For event 6, the hypothesis gives a number of events greater than the number of events that really happened, so one is subtracted. For events 7 and 17 there is no penalty—we observe 30 ≤ 76 and 62 ≤ 94. So, one was added because the attack was hypothesized and one was subtracted because for the 6th entry there were more events hypothesized than really happened. In 2 we have a second case: Intrusion type 21 was hypothesized which requires events of types 6 again, 17 again, and 23. For event types 17 and 23 there is no penalty because (AE ∗ I)17 ≤ OV17 and (AE ∗ I)23 ≤ OV23, and for event 6, there is no penalty either, because the penalty was already taken into account for intrusion type 5.

The heuristic procedure is based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) where artificial ants successively construct solutions based on pheromones (stigmergy) and local information. The key feature of our algorithm is the use of two distinct but simplified pheromone matrices in order to improve convergence but still provide enough flexibility for effectively guiding the solution construction process. We show that by parallelizing the algorithm we can improve the solution quality significantly. We applied our algorithm to the instances used for the ITC2007. The results document that our approach is among the leading algorithms for this problem; in all cases the optimal solution could be found. Furthermore we discuss the characteristics of the instances where the algorithm performs especially well.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;artificial ants;automatic parallelization;heuristic;mathematical optimization;stigmergy	Clemens Nothegger;Alfred Mayer;Andreas M.

f60812814c8c84f7dd824de628ed776d2865c494	affinity propagation and uncapacitated facility location problems	simple plant location problem;clustering;affinity propagation;heuristics;exact algorithms	One of the most important distinctions that must be made in clustering research is the difference between models (or problems) and the methods for solving those problems. Nowhere is this more evident than with the evaluation of the popular affinity propagation algorithm (apcluster.m), which is a MATLAB implementation of a neural clustering method that has received significant attention in the biological sciences and other disciplines. Several authors have undertaken comparisons of apcluster.m with methods designed for models that fall within the class of uncapacitated facility location problems (UFLPs). These comparative models include the p-center (or K-center) model and, more importantly, the p-median (or K-median) model. The results across studies are conflicting and clouded by the fact that, although similar, the optimization model underlying apcluster.m is slightly different from the p-median model and appreciably different from the pcenter model. In this paper, we clarify that apcluster.m is actually a heuristic for a `maximization version' of another model in the class of UFLPs, which is known as the simple plant location problem (SPLP). An exact method for the SPLP is described, and the apcluster.m program is compared to a fast heuristic procedure (sasplp.m) in both a simulation experiment and across numerous datasets from the literature. Although the exact method is the preferred approach when computationally feasible, both apcluster.m and sasplp.m are efficient and effective heuristic approaches, with the latter slightly outperforming the former in most instances.	affinity propagation;facility location problem;software propagation	Michael J.

e3d937d81b38392ecc17647869f90b8b74113919	a multi-agent based approach to modeling and solving dynamic generalized travelling salesman problem		This paper introduces four different types of Generalized Travelling Salesman Problem (GTSP) which are actually dynamic variants of the well-known logistics problems. For all of these defined types, new cities are added to/deleted from the city domain during the travelling of the salesman. This city addition and deletion during the solution phase of the problem, differentiates the proposed types from the classical GTSP. Since these variants of GTSP are relatively complicated compared to classical forms, an agent-based strategy is proposed in this paper to handle complexity and dynamism. In this respect, proposed agent-based strategy employs a general manager and numerous region agents to control and coordinate the dynamism in their regions and in the central level. Region agents create solutions just for their regions and thereby complexity of obtaining a central solution for each change containing is avoided. Findings of the proposed agent-based strategy confirm that adaptation ability of agent-based strategy against the dynamism is significantly better than classical central solution approach. In this respect, this paper is expected to be novel in two respects. First, those four types of GTSP defined in this paper, are different from the classical GTSP since they have dynamic city domain. Second, the proposed novel agent-based solution strategy is capable to create solutions in a timely manner.	agent-based model;complexity;logistics;multi-agent system;set tsp problem;travelling salesman problem;whole earth 'lectronic link	Adil Baykasoglu;Zeynep D.

The starting point is a solution calculated by a heuristic algorithm, termed  SHRP , that aims to optimize the two main objectives, i.e. the number of cuts and the number of different patterns. Here, we propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize other secondary objectives such as changeovers, completion times of orders pondered by priorities and open stacks. We report experimental results showing that the multi-objective genetic algorithm is able to improve the solutions obtained by  SHRP on the secondary objectives.	cutting stock problem;genetic algorithm	César Muñoz;María R.

The Clarke & Wright (C&W) algorithm is one of the most widely used classical heuristics in capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) in which a linear function of distance is considered as the objective function. The C&W algorithm is very simple and easy to implement, and produces fairly good solutions very fast. In this study, the C&W algorithm is adopted for the cumulative VRP with limited duration (CumVRP-LD) where load is also considered in the objective function as well as distance. The most common applications of cumulative VRPs are the determination of routing policies that minimize total fuel consumption. A 2-phase constructive heuristic approach including the K-means clustering algorithm is proposed to improve the computational performance of the modified C&W algorithm for CumVRP-LD. The main contribution of this study is the definition of a new extended formulation that captures truck-load and travel distance by considering the unique characteristics of the problem and to develop a fast and easy implemented constructive algorithm for CumVRP-LD. Such approaches are necessary for the development of systems that respond fast, possibly online, to changes in the real problem situations.		Didem Çinar;Konstantinos Gakis;Panos M.

Multiple criteria models seem a more adequate representation of districting problems in real-world situations. Real-life decision situations are by their very nature multidimensional. This paper deals with the problem of partitioning a territory into “homogeneous” zones. Each zone is composed of a set of elementary territorial units. A district map is formed by partitioning the set of elementary units into connected zones without inclusions. When multiple criteria are considered, the problem of enumerating all the efficient solutions for such a model is known as being NP-hard, which is why we decided to avoid using exact methods to solve large-size instances. In this paper, we propose a new method to approximate the Pareto front based on an evolutionary algorithm with local search. The algorithm presents a new solution representation and the crossover/mutation operators. Its main features are the following: it F.

The formulation of the model requires the solution of a complex computational geometry problem, and therefore the use of heuristics and metaheuristics applies.

On the other hand, it is known that fitness assignment has a marked impact on the performance of evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm (EMOA). In this paper, a hybrid EMOA is proposed, which divides the population into several smaller subpopulations according to their distribution in the objective space. Each subpopulation is evolved by an individual EMOA, and a hybrid performance measure estimates the performance of these EMOAs. We focus on the fitness assignment and assume that all EMOAs used in the subpopulations adopt the same recombination operator. To evaluate performance of the proposed algorithm, we compare it with MOEA/D-M2M, MOE-A/D, SMS-EMOA and NSGA-II on 16 test instances. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than or similar to those compared EMOAs.	algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;m2m (eclipse);moe;moea framework;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;simulation	Fangqing Gu;Hai-Lin Liu;Kay Chen Tan	2015	Soft Comput.	10.1007/s00500-014-1480-9	mathematical optimization;hybrid algorithm;computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-objective optimization;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;decomposition	AI	22.769522750908514	-1.9756249961389902	195006

The population loops of evolutionary algorithms (EA) are parallelized using sharedmemory parallelism to address the high computational demands of such applications. This methodology is applied to solve the management problems in an aquifer system in Kish Island, Iran using a three-dimensional density-dependent groundwater numerical model. EAs of continuous ant colony optimization (CACO), particle swarm optimization, and genetic algorithm are utilized to solve the optimization problems. By implementing the parallelization strategy, a speedup ratio of up to 3.53 on an 8-core processor is achieved in comparison with serial model. Based on solution quality and computational time criteria, the CACO robustness is observed in comparison to other EAs. Moreover, the optimization solution of the case study for a scenario of sea-level-rise indicates that a reduction of 20% in groundwater extraction rate is mainly due to the land-surface inundation caused by sea-level rise. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

02e1fb185e9c8f34f14dab8f4b24f42a5134eed8	scheduling conservation designs for maximum flexibility via network cascade optimization	article	One approach to conserving endangered species is to purchase and protect a set of land parcels in a way that maximizes the expected future population spread. Unfortunately, an ideal set of parcels may have a cost that is beyond the immediate budget constraints and must thus be purchased incrementally. This raises the challenge of deciding how to schedule the parcel purchases in a way that maximizes the flexibility of budget usage while keeping population spread loss in control. In this paper, we introduce a formulation of this scheduling problem that does not rely on knowing the future budgets of an organization. In particular, we consider scheduling purchases in a way that achieves a population spread no less than desired but delays purchases as long as possible. Such schedules offer conservation planners maximum flexibility and use available budgets in the most efficient way. We develop the problem formally as a stochastic optimization problem over a network cascade model describing a commonly used model of population spread. Our solution approach is based on reducing the stochastic problem to a novel variant of the directed Steiner tree problem, which we call the set-weighted directed Steiner graph problem. We show that this problem is computationally hard, motivating the development of a primal-dual algorithm for the problem that computes both a feasible solution and a bound on the quality of an optimal solution. We evaluate the approach on both real and synthetic conservation data with a standard population spread model. The algorithm is shown to produce near optimal results and is much more scalable than more generic off-the-shelf optimizers. Finally, we evaluate a variant of the algorithm to explore the trade-offs between budget savings and population growth.	approximation algorithm;diffusing update algorithm;direct method in the calculus of variations;early stopping;epoch (reference date);error-tolerant design;experiment;graph theory;iteration;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;population;purchasing;randomness;reinforcement learning;scalability;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);schema evolution;solution architecture;solver;steiner tree problem;stochastic optimization;stochastic process;synthetic intelligence	Shan Xue;Alan Fern;Daniel Sheldon	2015	J.

By first locating the active components (parts) of one algorithm and then inserting them into second one, we can build efficient and accurate optimization, search, and learning algorithms. This gives a concrete way of constructing new techniques that contrasts the spread ad hoc way of hybridizing. In this paper, the enhanced algorithm is a Cellular Genetic Algorithm (cGA) which has been successfully used in the past to find solutions to such hard optimization problems. In order to extend and corroborate the use of active components as an emerging hybridization methodology, we propose here the use of active components taken from Scatter Search (SS) to improve cGA. The results obtained over a varied set of benchmarks are highly satisfactory in efficacy and efficiency when compared with a standard cGA. Moreover, the proposed hybrid approach (i.e., cGA+SS) has shown encouraging results with regard to earlier applications of our methodology.	benchmark (computing);crossbreeding;embedding;evaluation;genetic algorithm;hepatocyte growth factor;hoc (programming language);hybrid algorithm;machine learning;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;nucleic acid hybridization;sensor;solutions;way to go;interest	Andrea Villagra;Enrique Alba;Guillermo Leguizamón	2016		10.1155/2016/8289237	simulation;artificial intelligence	Vision	23.062989355958024	-2.833072867505112	195983

4bf090386b602c4f44f8159445ffd370b4a8324b	joint optimization of preventive maintenance and spare parts inventory using genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization algorithm		The problem of joint optimization of preventive maintenance and spare parts inventory was solved in this paper. The novelty of this study lies with the fact that the developed method could tackle not only the artificial test case but also a real-world industrial problem. Various investigators developed several methods and semi-analytical tools for obtaining optimum solutions for this problem. In this study, non-traditional optimization tools, namely genetic algorithms (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm were utilized to obtain the joint optimum preventive maintenance and spare parts inventory ordering interval. The optimum values of time interval yielded by both the GA and PSO algorithm were compared and found to be in agreement with the published results for the similar models obtained through semi-numerical methods. It proves the applicability of these non-traditional optimization tools to solve these problems. This investigation ended with the analysis of preventive maintenance data taken from an industry, for an electric overhead traveling crane. The optimum time schedules so suggested by the GA and PSO algorithm were found to be cost effective, in comparison with the current practice being followed by the industry. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted at the end for this industrial problem.	genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization	Nishith Kumar Samal;Dilip Kumar Pratihar	2015	Int.

The firm wants to partition a set of customers, who share geographical and marketing attributes, 3 into segments according to certain requirements: (a) customers allocated to the same segment must 4 have very similar attributes: type of contract, type of store and the average difference of purchase 5 volume; and (b) compact segments are desired. The main reason for creating a partition with these 6 features is because the firm wants to try different product marketing strategies. In this paper, we 7 propose a detailed attribute formulation and an iterated greedy heuristic that iteratively destroys 8 and reconstructs a given partition. The initial partition is obtained by using a modified k-means 9 algorithm that involves a GRASP philosophy to get the initial configuration of centroids. The 10 heuristic includes an improvement method that employs a variable neighborhood search procedure. 11 Computational results and statistical analyses show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 12	computation;disk partitioning;emoticon;grasp;greedy algorithm;heuristic;iteration;k-means clustering;local search (optimization);requirement;variable neighborhood search	Diana L.

However, the potential of the SAT-Plan strategy has not been fully exploited. Following the SAT-Plan paradigm, in this paper we formulate a STRIPS planning problem as a maximum SAT (max-SAT) and develop a general two-phase algorithm for planning. Our method first represents a planning problem as a combinatorial optimization in the form of a SAT compounded with an objective function to be maximized. It then uses a goal-oriented variable selection to force goal-oriented search and a accumulative learnt strategy to avoid to learn a learnt clause multiple times. We integrate our new methods with SATPLAN04. We evaluate and demonstrate the efficacy of our new formulation and algorithm with SATPLAN04 on many well-known real-world benchmark planning problems. Our experimental results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms SATPLAN04 on most of these problems, sometimes with an order of magnitude of improvement in running time.	automated planning and scheduling;benchmark (computing);boolean satisfiability problem;chaff algorithm;combinatorial optimization;feature selection;loss function;mathematical optimization;maximum satisfiability problem;optimization problem;programming paradigm;strips;solver;time complexity;two-phase locking	Zhao Xing;Yixin Chen;Weixiong Zhang	2006			mathematical optimization;machine learning;combinatorial optimization;goal orientation;feature selection;artificial intelligence;satisfiability;computer science;strips	AI	22.844589367152718	3.8959486014449616	196574

We present new optimization model based on Constraint Programming. The emphasis is put on several comparisons including the pure CP solver performance, solution convergence, and application of the model within other local search methods. Experiments indicate fairly decent CP performance on smaller instances. Embedding CP into local search methods improves the runtime/convergence performance, and satisfiable solutions are found even under severe time constraints.	motion planning;plasma cleaning;robot	Stanislav Slusny;Michal Zerola;Roman Neruda	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14932-0_55	constraint logic programming;mathematical optimization;constraint programming;constraint satisfaction;computer science;local search;mathematics;motion planning;constraint;constraint satisfaction problem;algorithm;satisfiability	Robotics	20.69672020617881	2.9098903151710105	197228
752a12a2133abb4ee907eceda52344553b8a3dfb	university-timetabling problem and its solution using gels algorithm: a case study		Course scheduling includes a large volume of data with numerous constraints and unchangeable specifications and each university deals with several times a year. Course scheduling is a NP-hard problem and using traditional methods to solve it is very difficult. But evolutionary algorithms suggest good solutions for this type of problems. In this paper we used gravitational emulation local search algorithm to solve the course scheduling problem which is an evolutionary algorithm. Results demonstrate the good quality of time table provided by the proposed algorithm and also decreased time against other algorithms.	algorithm	Majid Nikougoftar Nategh;Ali A. R.

This approach uses well defined move strategies and a structured neighbourhood, defines appropriate tabu status and tenure and takes account of objective function approximation to speed up the search process. A sound understanding of the problem has helped in many ways in designing and enhancing the tabu search methodology. The method uses diversification, intensification and handles infeasibility via strategic oscillation.#R##N##R##N#The above methodology is tested on existing problems from the literature and also on parametrically generated problems with encouraging results. For comparison of results, optimal solutions are used in the former and lower bounds obtained by Lagrangian heuristics are used in the latter.	schedule (project management);tabu search	Paul R.

Ideas on multi-start local search, ejection chains, simulated annealing and evolutionary computation are combined in a heuristic that is both robust and efficient. The proposed method produces results that are on par with the current best solutions, at a fraction of the computation time needed by previous best approaches. Given the significantly lower time consumption over methods proposed previously in the literature, we consider our approach especially useful in dynamic routing problems, where decisions must be made in real-time.

3a34cb90ee5a8bf30d643b8b6ef39b81f3a78f32	a preliminary selection of problems in heuristic search	dynamic programming;graphs;heuristic search	The Heuristic Search community has been concentrating much effort during the last decades in solving more and more efficiently the SHORTEST PATH problem (SPP). As a result, a valuable body of scientific results has been produced, mostly in the form of heuristics and search algorithms. However, not much attention has been given to other problems even if they result from slight variations of the typical problems addressed by the community. Furthermore, other communities attempt at solving hard combinatorial problems which might be well solved with heuristic search. In this paper, an attempt is presented to introduce a preliminary selection of relevant problems that goes well beyond the classical SPP.	a* search algorithm;heuristic (computer science);search algorithm;self-propelled particles;semantics (computer science);shortest path problem;state space;the australian	Carlos Linares López;Abdallah Saffidine	2015			beam search;mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;incremental heuristic search;effort heuristic	AI	24.508483855157312	3.100233367892763	199177
b4db92f6fc148bea5c25e79f59538c2ac75f4d33	application of a logistical optimization method to optimize existing low-voltage grids		This paper shows how classical logistical planning problems (ware-house-location problems) can be applied to the optimization of low-voltage grids. The suggested solution is an iterative combination of two different algorithms. The Repeated Matching Algorithm for finding the site for the substation and its supply area and the formulation of an integer linear optimization problem for optimal grid expansion. The objective is the determination of substation sites, their type and the supply area as well as the position of any necessary additional lines, in which the overall costs are at a minimum. In the first part of the paper, the basic method of the Repeated Matching Heuristic is explained. The second part is an example of a real low-voltage grid of a small town.	algorithm;heuristic;integer programming;iterative method;linear programming;logistics;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;traction substation;warez	Gerrit Schlomer;Lutz Hofmann	2017	2017 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe (ISGT-Europe)	10.1109/ISGTEurope.2017.8260185	grid;smart grid;mathematical optimization;blossom algorithm;linear programming;heuristic;symmetric matrix;low voltage;integer;computer science	Robotics	17.52121158633441	3.6733408472829896	199255

The objective is to maximize the profit obtained by a chain (the leader) knowing that a competitor (the follower) will react by locating another single facility after the leader locates its own facility. Contrary to what is commonly done in literature, it is assumed that the demand is endogenous, namely, it varies depending on the distances to and on the quality of the facilities. This assumption increases the complexity of the problem and, therefore, the computational effort needed to solve it. A subpopulation based evolutionary algorithm called TLUEGO was recently proposed to cope with this hard-to-solve global optimization problem. However, it requires high computational effort, even to manage small-size problems, despite the use of a 'fuse' process aimed at reducing the size of the population. This is mainly due to the high cost of evaluating the leader's objective function, which requires the resolution of another hard-to-solve optimization problem, namely, the follower's problem. In this work, three parallelizations of TLUEGO are proposed, which not only allow us to obtain the solution faster, but also to solve larger instances. In particular, a distributed memory programming algorithm (suitable for multicomputers), a shared memory programming algorithm (suitable for multiprocessors, as most of today's PCs are) and a hybrid of the two previous algorithms (suitable for clusters) are proposed. The computational studies show that the three parallelizations are efficient. Furthermore, they allow to obtain better results than the sequential algorithm, since thanks to the use of the new resources, the 'fuse' process employed by the sequential algorithm can be omitted.	central processing unit;computation;distributed memory;endogeneity (econometrics);evolutionary algorithm;global optimization;hybrid algorithm;mathematical optimization;multi-core processor;optimization problem;parallel algorithm;personal computer;power supply unit (computer);requirement;scalability;sequential algorithm;shared memory;supercomputer;symmetric multiprocessing	Aránzazu Gila Arrondo;Juana López Redondo;José Fernández;P.

5bef13e9eca9cb992fd0552d9859296d1897d97a	a revised discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm for permutation flow-shop scheduling problem	makespan;particle swarm optimization;permutation flow shop scheduling problem	This research proposes a revised discrete particle swarm optimization (RDPSO) to solve the permutation flow-shop scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing makespan (PFSP-makespan). The candidate problem is one of the most studied NP-complete scheduling problems. RDPSO proposes new particle swarm learning strategies to thoroughly study how to properly apply the global best solution and the personal best solution to guide the search of RDPSO. A new filtered local search is developed to filter the solution regions that have been reviewed and guide the search to new solution regions in order to keep the search from premature convergence. Computational experiments on Taillard's benchmark problem sets demonstrate that RDPSO significantly outperforms all the existing PSO algorithms.	algorithm;flow shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;scheduling (computing)	Chun-Lung Chen;Shin-Ying Huang;Yeu-Ruey Tzeng;Chuen-Lung Chen	2014	Soft Comput.	10.1007/s00500-013-1199-z	job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;particle swarm optimization	Theory	22.622685661095982	-0.2932753529961653	199839
