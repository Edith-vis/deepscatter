20494e6a7ace9757640eed5abda06a3d4669f14c	causal visual interactions as revealed by an information theoretic measure and fmri	effective connectivity;visual areas;fmri;visual interaction;primary visual cortex;information flow;connectivity;information theoretic;posterior cerebral artery;riddoch syndrome	In the present study, we evaluated the direction of the effective connectivity between fMRI activations in neural structures mediating preserved visual function in a patient with homonymous hemianopsia due to a posterior cerebral artery stroke. Although the lesion affected the primary visual cortex, the visual abilities of this patient included above-chance verbal reports of movement and color change as well as the discrimination of movement direction in his hemianopic field. These abilities were coupled with awareness (Riddoch syndrome). The strength and the direction of the interactions between visual regions were assessed by applying directed transinformation (T), a nonparametric information theoretic causal measure sensitive to linear as well as to nonlinear interactions. In the healthy hemisphere, T identified a strong flow of information from visual area V1 to V5 during stimulation by visual movement and from V1 to V4/V8 during stimulation by color change. In addition, during color change stimulation, a bi-directional flow was observed between V4/V8 and V5, suggesting crosstalk between these regions. In the lesioned hemisphere, the color change stimulation evoked a stronger flow from V5 to V4/V8 and a flow from V4/V8 to V2. These observations provide support for the hypothesis that visual information is mediated via subcortical pathways that bypass V1 and project first to higher-tier visual areas V5 and V4/V8 then subsequently to lower-tier area V2.	biologic preservation;causal filter;cerebral cortex;cerebrovascular accident;crosstalk;hemianopsia;hemianopsia, homonymous;infarction, posterior cerebral artery;information theory;interaction;multitier architecture;mutual information;nonlinear system;patients;structure of cerebral artery;structure of posterior cerebral artery;vision;wolff-parkinson-white syndrome;bypass;fmri	Hermann Hinrichs;Hans-Jochen Heinze;Mircea Ariel Schoenfeld	2006	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.01.038	psychology;computer vision;information flow;visual memory;connectivity;visual n1;communication;n2pc;social psychology;statistics	ML	19.741939340633778	-78.72509650957349	178176
80a693814a6fb95548b2a87209dac9fa9667b989	different brains process numbers differently: structural bases of individual differences in spatial and nonspatial number representations	article letter to editor	A dominant hypothesis on how the brain processes numerical size proposes a spatial representation of numbers as positions on a “mental number line.” An alternative hypothesis considers numbers as elements of a generalized representation of sensorimotor-related magnitude, which is not obligatorily spatial. Here we show that individuals' relative use of spatial and nonspatial representations has a cerebral counterpart in the structural organization of the posterior parietal cortex. Interindividual variability in the linkage between numbers and spatial responses (faster left responses to small numbers and right responses to large numbers; spatial–numerical association of response codes effect) correlated with variations in gray matter volume around the right precuneus. Conversely, differences in the disposition to link numbers to force production (faster soft responses to small numbers and hard responses to large numbers) were related to gray matter volume in the left angular gyrus. This finding suggests that numerical cognition relies on multiple mental representations of analogue magnitude using different neural implementations that are linked to individual traits.	analog;angularjs;base;brain;code;cognition;eaf2 gene;gray matter;linkage (software);morphogenesis;numerical analysis;parietal lobe;requirement;sample variance;spatial variability;structure of angular gyrus;structure of precuneus;trait	Florian Krause;Oliver Lindemann;Ivan Toni;Harold Bekkering	2014	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn_a_00518	psychology;developmental psychology;communication	ML	19.4432622799115	-78.12401984362418	178563

Using simulated data, we categorize potential relationships between frequency variation over time in LFP recordings and spatial variability between electrodes. We then use data recorded from the intact preparation to distinguish between our theoretical categories. We find that the LFP recordings have a close to spatially invariant frequency distribution (not phase) across the hippocampus, and differ in frequency only in a component that may be seen as physiological noise. From these facts, we conclude that the isolated hippocampal LFP recordings represent a single signal and may be regarded as a unitary circuitry. We additionally examine phase differences across our recording sites. We use our characterization of the hippocampal isolate’s properties to predict its spatial coherence in response to high frequency stimulation. We find that there is a finely tuned inverse relationship between temporal variability in the hippocampal isolate’s LFP recordings and their spatial coherence.	categories;categorization;coherence (physics);electronic circuit;hippocampus (brain);in vitro [publication type];international conference on functional programming;least fixed point;spatial variability;spontaneous order;stationary process;electrode	Jesse A.

9a30b0e1acf068d7a7cbcdf059c72fa38e06403f	longitudinal changes in resting-state fmri from age 5 to age 6 years covary with language development	frontal to temporal connection;resting state fmri;language development;intrinsic connectivity;preschool children	Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful technique to study the whole-brain neural connectivity that underlies cognitive systems. The present study aimed to define the changes in neural connectivity in their relation to language development. Longitudinal resting-state functional data were acquired from a cohort of preschool children at age 5 and one year later, and changes in functional connectivity were correlated with language performance in sentence comprehension. For this, degree centrality, a voxel-based network measure, was used to assess age-related differences in connectivity at the whole-brain level. Increases in connectivity with age were found selectively in a cluster within the left posterior superior temporal gyrus and sulcus (STG/STS). In order to further specify the connection changes, a secondary seed-based functional connectivity analysis on this very cluster was performed. The correlations between resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and language performance revealed developmental effects with age and, importantly, also dependent on the advancement in sentence comprehension ability over time. In children with greater advancement in language abilities, the behavioral improvement was positively correlated with RSFC increase between left posterior STG/STS and other regions of the language network, i.e., left and right inferior frontal cortex. The age-related changes observed in this study provide evidence for alterations in the language network as language develops and demonstrates the viability of this approach for the investigation of normal and aberrant language development.	artificial intelligence;business architecture;c6orf15 gene;centrality;child, preschool;cingulate cortex;decision model and notation;dorsal motor nucleus;frontal lobe gyrus;ifng wt allele;inferior frontal gyrus;interphase cell;language development;magnetic resonance imaging;portable c compiler;prefrontal cortex;rest;resting state fmri;star trek generations;structure of broca's area;structure of precuneus;superior temporal gyrus;voxel;betulinic acid;dinoflagellate sulcus;inferior frontal sulcus (human only)	Yaqiong Xiao;Angela D.

We report the finding of power-law scaling in these signals using subdural electrocorticographic recordings from the surface of human cortex. The power spectral density (PSD) of the electric potential has the power-law form P(f ) approximately Af(-chi) from 80 to 500 Hz. This scaling index, chi = 4.0+/-0.1, is conserved across subjects, area in the cortex, and local neural activity levels. The shape of the PSD does not change with increases in local cortical activity, but the amplitude, A, increases. We observe a """"knee"""" in the spectra at f(0) approximately 75 Hz, implying the existence of a characteristic time scale tau = (2pif(0))(-1) approximately 2 - 4ms. Below f(0), we explore two-power-law forms of the PSD, and demonstrate that there are activity-related fluctuations in the amplitude of a power-law process lying beneath the alpha/beta rhythms. Finally, we illustrate through simulation how, small-scale, simplified neuronal models could lead to these power-law observations.

51bd905a7a756da1f51428738881040f45f6feda	cholinergic capacity mediates prefrontal engagement during challenges to attention: evidence from imaging genetics		In rodent studies, elevated cholinergic neurotransmission in right prefrontal cortex (PFC) is essential for maintaining attentional performance, especially in challenging conditions. Apparently paralleling the rises in acetylcholine seen in rodent studies, fMRI studies in humans reveal right PFC activation at or near Brodmann's areas 9 (BA 9) increases in response to elevated attentional demand. In the present study, we leveraged human genetic variability in the cholinergic system to test the hypothesis that the cholinergic system contributes to the BA 9 response to attentional demand. Specifically, we scanned (BOLD fMRI) participants with a polymorphism of the choline transporter gene that is thought to limit choline transport capacity (Ile89Val variant of the choline transporter gene SLC5A7, rs1013940) and matched controls while they completed a task previously used to demonstrate demand-related increases in right PFC cholinergic transmission in rats and right PFC activation in humans. As hypothesized, we found that although controls showed the typical pattern of robust BA 9 responses to increased attentional demand, Ile89Val participants did not. Further, pattern analysis of activation within this region significantly predicted participant genotype. Additional exploratory pattern classification analyses suggested that Ile89Val participants differentially recruited orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus to maintain attentional performance to the level of controls. These results contribute to a growing body of translational research clarifying the role of cholinergic signaling in human attention and functional neural measures, and begin to outline the risk and resiliency factors associated with potentially suboptimal cholinergic function with implications for disorders characterized by cholinergic dysregulation.	acetylcholine;business architecture;cfp wt allele;genetic translation process;heart rate variability;parahippocampal gyrus;pattern recognition;post-translational protein processing;powerbuilder foundation classes;prefrontal cortex;protective factors;scanning;sensorimotor cortex;synaptic transmission;choline transport;fmri	Anne S.

acc392d450a675daf5bda3bab3de1e30b6e142d7	statistical testing and power analysis for brain-wide association study	brain-wide association study;functional connectivity;random field theory;statistical power	Abstract The identification of connexel-wise associations, which involves examining functional connectivities between pairwise voxels across the whole brain, is both statistically and computationally challenging. Although such a connexel-wise methodology has recently been adopted by brain-wide association studies (BWAS) to identify connectivity changes in several mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism and depression, the multiple correction and power analysis methods designed specifically for connexel-wise analysis are still lacking. Therefore, we herein report the development of a rigorous statistical framework for connexel-wise significance testing based on the Gaussian random field theory. It includes controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER) of multiple hypothesis testings using topological inference methods, and calculating power and sample size for a connexel-wise study. Our theoretical framework can control the false-positive rate accurately, as validated empirically using two resting-state fMRI datasets. Compared with Bonferroni correction and false discovery rate (FDR), it can reduce false-positive rate and increase statistical power by appropriately utilizing the spatial information of fMRI data. Importantly, our method bypasses the need of non-parametric permutation to correct for multiple comparison, thus, it can efficiently tackle large datasets with high resolution fMRI images. The utility of our method is shown in a case-control study. Our approach can identify altered functional connectivities in a major depression disorder dataset, whereas existing methods fail.

However, little is understood about the neural systems underlying auditory-motor integration in the context of musical rhythm, or the enhanced ability of musicians to execute precisely timed sequences. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated how performance and neural activity were modulated as musicians and nonmusicians tapped in synchrony with progressively more complex and less metrically structured auditory rhythms. A functionally connected network was implicated in extracting higher-order features of a rhythm's temporal structure, with the dorsal premotor cortex mediating these auditory-motor interactions. In contrast to past studies, musicians recruited the prefrontal cortex to a greater degree than nonmusicians, whereas secondary motor regions were recruited to the same extent. We argue that the superior ability of musicians to deconstruct and organize a rhythm's temporal structure relates to the greater involvement of the prefrontal cortex mediating working memory.	interaction;magnetic resonance imaging;memory disorders;modulation;prefrontal cortex;fmri	Joyce L.

bbaa9edaf1192572221e25145e1cf6cba53bcf5e	effects of prefrontal bipolar and high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation on cortical reactivity and working memory in healthy adults	dorsolateral prefrontal cortex;tms eeg;hd tdcs;working memory;tdcs	Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a well-recognised neuromodulatory technology which has been shown to induce short-lasting changes in motor-cortical excitability. The recent and rapid expansion of tDCS into the cognitive domain, however, necessitates deeper mechanistic understanding of its neurophysiological effects over non-motor brain regions. The present study utilised transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) to probe the immediate and longer-term effects of both a bipolar (BP-tDCS) and more focal 4×1 High-Definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) montage applied over the left DLPFC on TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and oscillations in 19 healthy adult participants. 2-back working memory (WM) performance was also assessed as a marker of cognitive function. Region of interest (ROI) analyses taken from the F1 electrode directly adjacent to the stimulation site revealed increased P60 TEP amplitudes at this location 5min following BP-tDCS and 30min following HD-tDCS. Further global cluster based analyses of all scalp electrodes revealed widespread neuromodulatory changes following HD-tDCS, but not BP-tDCS, both five and 30min after stimulation, with reductions also detected in both beta and gamma oscillatory power over parieto-occipital channels 30min after stimulation. No significant changes in WM performance were observed following either HD-tDCS or BP-tDCS. This study highlights the capacity for single-session prefrontal anodal tDCS montages to modulate neurophysiological processes, as assessed with TMS-EEG.	acoustic evoked brain stem potentials;action potential;bipolar disorder;cerebral cortex;cognition;dorsolateral prefrontal cortex;electroencephalography phase synchronization;excited state;focal (programming language);hd term type;hdmi;memory disorders;memory, short-term;montagejs;neurotrophic electrode;probability amplitude;region of interest;transcranial direct current stimulation;transcranial magnetic stimulation	Aron T.

It is controversial whether motor- or sensory-related neural circuits recalibrate this asynchrony. By combining magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional MRI (fMRI), we investigate the temporal changes in brain activities caused by repeated exposure to a 150-ms delay inserted between a button-press action and a subsequent flash. We found that readiness potentials significantly shift later in the motor system, especially in parietal regions (average: 219.9 ms), while visually evoked potentials significantly shift earlier in occipital regions (average: 49.7 ms) in the delay condition compared to the no-delay condition. Moreover, the shift in readiness potentials, but not in visually evoked potentials, was significantly correlated with the psychophysical measure of motor-sensory adaptation. These results suggest that although both motor and sensory processes contribute to the recalibration, the motor process plays the major role, given the magnitudes of shift and the correlation with the psychophysical measure.	acclimatization;acoustic evoked brain stem potentials;action potential;asynchronous i/o;asynchrony (computer programming);clinical act of insertion;evoked potentials;magnetoencephalography;occipital lobe;parietal lobe;stmn1 wt allele;fmri	Chang Cai;Kenji Ogawa;Takanori Kochiyama;Hirokazu Tanaka;Hiroshi Imamizu	2018	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.02.015	magnetoencephalography;cognitive psychology;neuroscience;psychology;biological neural network;lag;motor system;correlation;sensory system;brain mapping;magnetic resonance imaging	ML	17.478680577630904	-78.25301785159925	181921

Here, we propose a Joint Sparse Representation Analysis method to identify common information across different functional contrasts in data from an fMRI experiment. We evaluate the use of a sparse representation analysis method within a Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) classification to classify individuals as young or older, based only on functional activation patterns in a speech listening task. Sixteen young (age: 19-26) and 16 older (age: 57-73) adults were scanned while listening to noise and to sentences degraded with noise, half of which contained meaningful context which is known to enhance intelligibility. Functional contrast images representing different perceptual and cognitive components of speech perception (i.e., auditory perception; speech perception, use of context to enhance perception) were used within the joint sparse representation analysis to generate basis activation sources and their corresponding sparse modulation profiles. Sparse modulation profiles were used to classify individuals into the young and older categories. Results demonstrate that a combination of functional contrast images yielded excellent classification performance.	activation function;algorithm;brain–computer interface;cognition;computer multitasking;high- and low-level;image noise;image scanner;intelligibility (philosophy);k-svd;linear classifier;linear discriminant analysis;list comprehension;map;modal logic;modulation;singular value decomposition;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;speech synthesis	Mahdi Ramezani;Purang Abolmaesumi;Kris Marble;H.

Although the functional associations between dopamine D2 receptors and motor and cognitive functions have been extensively examined in the striatum using positron emission tomography (PET), the role of dopamine D2 receptors in extrastriatal regions has been unexplored. We aimed to investigate the relationship between dopamine D2 receptors in extrastriatal regions and the performance of a broad spectrum of cognitive functions including memory, language, attention, and executive function in healthy subjects. Extrastriatal dopamine D2 receptors were measured in 25 male subjects using PET with [(11)C]FLB457. After the PET scans, a battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to all subjects. We found that the binding potential (BP) of [(11)C]FLB457 in the hippocampus was positively correlated with memory function. Furthermore, BP of [(11)C]FLB457 in the hippocampus, but not in the prefrontal cortex, was associated with frontal lobe functions such as executive function and verbal fluency. Our findings suggest that dopamine D2 receptors in the hippocampus might affect the local hippocampal function, but also brain functions outside the hippocampus such as the prefrontal cortex.	acoustic lobing;brain;ct scan;cerebral cortex;cognition disorders;computer memory;dopamine d2 receptor;epilepsy, temporal lobe;executive function;hippocampus (brain);memory bound function;mental association;neostriatum;neuropsychological tests;polyethylene terephthalate;positron-emission tomography;positrons;prefrontal cortex;frontal lobe	Hidehiko Takahashi;Motoichiro Kato;Mika Hayashi;Yoshiro Okubo;Akihiro Takano;Hiroshi Ito;Tetsuya Suhara	2007	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.11.008	psychology;cognitive psychology;spectrum;neuroscience;dopamine receptor d2;cognition;developmental psychology;binding potential;working memory;verbal fluency test	ML	18.831350825065627	-78.51171411267599	182856

Extracellular action potentials outside axons are small in amplitude and spatially spread out, while they are larger in amplitude and much more spatially confined near cell bodies. We estimated the extracellular potentials associated with an action potential in a cortical pyramidal cell using standard one-dimensional cable theory and volume conductor theory. Their spatial and temporal pattern reveal much about the location and timing of currents in the cell, especially in combination with a known morphology, and simple experiments could resolve questions about spike initiation. From the extracellular potential we compute the ephaptically induced polarization in a nearby passive cable. The magnitude of this induced voltage can be several mV, does not spread electrotonically, and depends only weakly on the passive properties of the cable. We discuss their possible functional relevance.	a fibers;action potentials;action potential;axon;cable theory;cell body of neuron;cognitive function: initiation;dendrites;experiment;galaxy morphological classification;human body;interaction;large;pyramidal cells;relevance;tissue fiber;tract (literature);voltage	Gary R.

We examined the cortical reorganization in achondroplastic dwarfs submitted to progressive elongation (PE) of lower limbs through the Ilizarov technique. This paradigm is ideal for studying cortical plasticity because it avoids the perturbation connected with deafferentation and re-afferentation. Somatosensory evoked-potentials (SEP) and fMRI studies were performed before and after PE during foot and knee stimulation, above and below the surgical fracture. A body schema test was also performed. Following PE, cortical modifications were observed in the primary somatosensory cortex for foot stimulation and in higher order somatosensory cortices for foot and knee. The former modifications tended to decrease 6 months after the elongation ending, whereas the latter tended to persist. Results are interpreted in terms of cortical adaptation mediated by temporary disorganization.	acclimatization;acoustic evoked brain stem potentials;action potential;amputation;body part;deafferentation procedure;dwarfism;facial hemiatrophy;limb structure;lower extremity;peripheral neuropathy;programming paradigm;progressive scan;somatosensory cortex;symantec endpoint protection;transplanted tissue;fmri	Francesco Di Russo;Giorgia Committeri;Sabrina Pitzalis;Grazia Spitoni;Laura Piccardi;Gaspare Galati;Maurizio Angelo Catagni;Daniele Nico;Cecilia Guariglia;Luigi Pizzamiglio	2006	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.09.051	psychology;neuroplasticity;neuroscience;somatosensory evoked potential;higher-order logic;magnetic resonance imaging;body schema;brain mapping;anatomy;surgery;somatosensory system	ML	18.179267707694066	-79.8135259695528	183567

8d598a46bbb76efb323b96e78c9fbf469f301823	bayesian hypothesis testing for pattern discrimination in brain decoding	generalization error;interpretability and validation;hypothesis testing;brain decoding	Research in cognitive neuroscience and in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is frequently concerned with finding evidence that a given brain area processes, or encodes, given stimuli. Experiments based on neuroimaging techniques consist of a stimulation protocol presented to a subject while his or her brain activity is being recorded. The question is then whether there is enough evidence of brain activity related to the stimuli within the recorded data. Finding a link between brain activity and stimuli has recently been proposed as a classification task, called brain decoding. A classifier that can accurately predict which stimuli were presented to the subject provides support for a positive answer to the question. However, it is only the answer for a given data set and the question still remains whether it is a general rule that will apply also to new data. In this paper we try to reliably answer the neuroscientific question about the presence of a significant link between brain activity and stimuli once we have the classification results. The proposed method is based on a Beta-Binomial model for the population of generalization errors of classifiers from multi-subject studies within the Bayesian hypothesis testing framework. We present an application on nine brain decoding investigations from a real functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment about the relation between mental calculation and eye movements.

55a00e2eb304243dec8f8c05a711af8984ea1a10	unsupervised manifold learning using high-order morphological brain networks derived from t1-w mri for autism diagnosis	autism spectrum disorder;classification;diagnosis;hierarchical ensemble classifier;high-order brain connectivity;morphological brain network;morphological connectional biomarkers;multi-kernel learning	Brain disorders, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), alter brain functional (from fMRI) and structural (from diffusion MRI) connectivities at multiple levels and in varying degrees. While unraveling such alterations have been the focus of a large number of studies, morphological brain connectivity has been out of the research scope. In particular, shape-to-shape relationships across brain regions of interest (ROIs) were rarely investigated. As such, the use of networks based on morphological brain data in neurological disorder diagnosis, while leveraging the advent of machine learning, could complement our knowledge on brain wiring alterations in unprecedented ways. In this paper, we use conventional T1-weighted MRI to define morphological brain networks (MBNs), each quantifying shape relationship between different cortical regions for a specific cortical attribute at both low-order and high-order levels. While typical brain connectomes investigate the relationship between two ROIs, we propose high-order MBN which better captures brain complex interactions by modeling the morphological relationship between pairs of ROIs. For ASD identification, we present a connectomic manifold learning framework, which learns multiple kernels to estimate a similarity measure between ASD and normal controls (NC) connectional features, to perform dimensionality reduction for clustering ASD and NC subjects. We benchmark our ASD identification method against both supervised and unsupervised state-of-the-art methods, while depicting the most discriminative high- and low-order relationships between morphological regions in the left and right hemispheres.	autism spectrum disorders;autistic disorder;baseline (configuration management);benchmark (computing);brain diseases;brain neoplasms;cluster analysis;complement system proteins;connectome;connectome;connectomics;dementia;discriminative model;ensemble learning;feature selection;generic drugs;interaction;machine learning;neuroinformatics;nonlinear dimensionality reduction;numerous;prtn3 wt allele;pervasive development disorder;region of interest;similarity measure;supervised learning;unsupervised learning;wiring;fmri;manifold;nervous system disorder;statistical cluster	Mayssa Soussia;Islem Rekik	2018		10.3389/fninf.2018.00070	autism;neuroscience;machine learning;discriminative model;asd;dimensionality reduction;similarity measure;connectome;diffusion mri;nonlinear dimensionality reduction;artificial intelligence;computer science	ML	23.535576133717875	-78.16956361706178	185116
01c1466ae477bd0d2631c260f3baeeb440262c49	combining optogenetic stimulation and fmri to validate a multivariate dynamical systems model for estimating causal brain interactions	dynamical systems;channelrhodopsin;optogenetic fmri;causality	State-space multivariate dynamical systems (MDS) (Ryali et al. 2011) and other causal estimation models are being increasingly used to identify directed functional interactions between brain regions. However, the validity and accuracy of such methods are poorly understood. Performance evaluation based on computer simulations of small artificial causal networks can address this problem to some extent, but they often involve simplifying assumptions that reduce biological validity of the resulting data. Here, we use a novel approach taking advantage of recently developed optogenetic fMRI (ofMRI) techniques to selectively stimulate brain regions while simultaneously recording high-resolution whole-brain fMRI data. ofMRI allows for a more direct investigation of causal influences from the stimulated site to brain regions activated downstream and is therefore ideal for evaluating causal estimation methods in vivo. We used ofMRI to investigate whether MDS models for fMRI can accurately estimate causal functional interactions between brain regions. Two cohorts of ofMRI data were acquired, one at Stanford University and the University of California Los Angeles (Cohort 1) and the other at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (Cohort 2). In each cohort, optical stimulation was delivered to the right primary motor cortex (M1). General linear model analysis revealed prominent downstream thalamic activation in Cohort 1, and caudate-putamen (CPu) activation in Cohort 2. MDS accurately estimated causal interactions from M1 to thalamus and from M1 to CPu in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively. As predicted, no causal influences were found in the reverse direction. Additional control analyses demonstrated the specificity of causal interactions between stimulated and target sites. Our findings suggest that MDS state-space models can accurately and reliably estimate causal interactions in ofMRI data and further validate their use for estimating causal interactions in fMRI. More generally, our study demonstrates that the combined use of optogenetics and fMRI provides a powerful new tool for evaluating computational methods designed to estimate causal interactions between distributed brain regions.	caudate nucleus structure;causal filter;causality;cerebral cortex;chapel;computer simulation;data acquisition;design of experiments;download;downstream (software development);dynamic connectivity;dynamical system;estimated;general linear model;image resolution;interaction;lab website;myelodysplastic syndrome;medical imaging;optogenetics;performance evaluation;sacral nerve stimulation;sensitivity and specificity;state space;thalamic structure;video-in video-out;web site;primary motor cortex	Srikanth Ryali;Yen-Yu Ian Shih;Tianwen Chen;John Kochalka;Daniel L.

Eighteen patients, who had recovered partially or totally from dysfunctions due to a monohemispheric infarction within the middle cerebral artery territory, underwent magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of rolandic areas cerebral activity both in rest state (spectral power properties) and in response to the electrical stimulation of the contralateral median nerve (M20 and M30 cortical sources). MEG evaluation was performed in acute (T0: mean 5 days from ischemic attach) and post-acute phase (T1: median 6 months). At T1, all the inter-hemispheric asymmetries were reduced for both spontaneous and evoked activity parameters with respect to T0. In post-acute phase, lower cortical excitability, higher delta and theta power and lower spectral entropy were associated to a worse clinical state. An unusual recruitment-as revealed by an excessive inter-hemispheric asymmetry of M20 cortical source position-correlated with higher level of clinical amelioration in the patients who showed a partial recovery. In addition to confirmative evidence that """"normalization"""" of neural activity in both the affected and unaffected hemispheres subtends best clinical recovery, present data provide support to the positive role of cerebral plasticity phenomena--i.e. unusual neural recruitments--to regain lost functions in those patients unable to achieve total recovery."""	amelioration pattern;cerebral infarction;cerebral cortex;cerebrovascular accident;electric stimulation technique;functional electrical stimulation;magnetoencephalography;patients;spontaneous order;structure of cerebral artery;structure of median nerve;structure of middle cerebral artery	Franca Tecchio;Filippo Zappasodi;Mario Tombini;Antonio Oliviero;Patrizio Pasqualetti;Fabrizio Vernieri;Matilde Ercolani;Vittorio Pizzella;Paolo Maria Rossini	2006	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.05.004	psychology;neuroplasticity;neuroscience;developmental psychology;acute-phase protein;resting state fmri;surgery	ML	18.46871973703022	-80.16415603856132	185449

Whilst breathing perceptions often correlate poorly with objective measures of lung function in both healthy and clinical populations, we have previously demonstrated closer matching between subjective breathlessness and changes in ventilation in endurance athletes, suggesting that athletes may be more accurate during respiratory interoception. To better understand the link between exercise and breathlessness, we sought to identify the mechanisms by which the brain processing of respiratory perception might be optimised in athletes. Twenty endurance athletes and twenty sedentary controls underwent 7 T functional magnetic resonance imaging. Inspiratory resistive loading induced conscious breathing perceptions (breathlessness), and a delay-conditioning paradigm was employed to evoke preceding periods of breathlessness-anticipation. Athletes demonstrated anticipatory brain activity that positively correlated with resulting breathing perceptions within key interoceptive areas, such as the thalamus, insula and primary sensorimotor cortices, which was negatively correlated in sedentary controls. Athletes also exhibited altered connectivity between interoceptive attention networks and primary sensorimotor cortex. These functional differences in athletic brains suggest that exercise may alter anticipatory representations of respiratory sensations. Future work may probe whether these brain mechanisms are harnessed when exercise is employed to treat breathlessness within chronic respiratory disease.	apnea;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;brain;cerebral cortex;conditioning (psychology);dyspnea;electroencephalography;esthesia;insula of reil;population;programming paradigm;resonance;respiration;respiratory distress syndrome, adult;respiratory insufficiency;respiratory tract diseases;respiratory physiology;sense;sensorimotor cortex;thalamic structure;while;chronic respiratory disease	Olivia K.

However, the neural mechanisms whereby emotion impacts memory encoding remain largely unexplored. The present study used a levels-of-processing manipulation to characterize the impact of emotion on encoding with and without the influence of elaborative processes. Participants viewed emotionally negative, neutral, and positive scenes under two conditions: a shallow condition focused on the perceptual features of the scenes and a deep condition that queried their semantic meaning. Recognition memory was tested 2 days later. Results showed that emotional memory enhancements were greatest in the shallow condition. fMRI analyses revealed that the right amygdala predicted subsequent emotional memory in the shallow more than deep condition, whereas the right ventrolateral PFC demonstrated the reverse pattern. Furthermore, the association of these regions with the hippocampus was modulated by valence: the amygdala–hippocampal link was strongest for negative stimuli, whereas the prefrontal–hippocampal link was strongest for positive stimuli. Taken together, these results suggest two distinct activation patterns underlying emotional memory formation: an amygdala component that promotes memory during shallow encoding, especially for negative information, and a prefrontal component that provides extra benefits during deep encoding, especially for positive information.	amygdaloid structure;consciousness;hippocampus (brain);lung consolidation;memory disorders;memory management;modulation;powerbuilder foundation classes;quantum information;semiconductor consolidation;the legend of zelda: a link to the past;benefit;fmri	Maureen Ritchey;Kevin S.

In the absence of this variability, the brain may act as a single homogenous entity without regional specialization. In this study, we investigate the variability in functional links categorized on the basis of the presence of direct structural paths (primary) or indirect paths mediated by one (secondary) or more (tertiary) brain regions ascertained by diffusion tensor imaging. We quantified the variability in functional connectivity using an unbiased estimate of unpredictability (functional connectivity entropy) in a neuropsychiatric disorder where structure-function relationship is considered to be abnormal; 34 patients with schizophrenia and 32 healthy controls underwent DTI and resting state functional MRI scans. Less than one-third (27.4% in patients, 27.85% in controls) of functional links between brain regions were regarded as direct primary links on the basis of DTI tractography, while the rest were secondary or tertiary. The most significant changes in the distribution of functional connectivity in schizophrenia occur in indirect tertiary paths with no direct axonal linkage in both early (P=0.0002, d=1.46) and late (P=1×10(-17), d=4.66) stages of schizophrenia, and are not altered by the severity of symptoms, suggesting that this is an invariant feature of this illness. Unlike those with early stage illness, patients with chronic illness show some additional reduction in the distribution of connectivity among functional links that have direct structural paths (P=0.08, d=0.44). Our findings address a critical gap in the literature linking structure and function in schizophrenia, and demonstrate for the first time that the abnormal state of functional connectivity preferentially affects structurally unconstrained links in schizophrenia. It also raises the question of a continuum of dysconnectivity ranging from less direct (structurally unconstrained) to more direct (structurally constrained) brain pathways underlying the progressive clinical staging and persistence of schizophrenia.	central serous chorioretinopathy;chronic disease;conflict (psychology);diffusion tensor imaging;european union;illness (finding);limited stage (cancer stage);mood disorders;patients;rest;schizophrenia;science;specialization;fmri;tertiary	Ye Yao;Lena Palaniyappan;Peter F.

Because of our own movements—for example, changes in eye position, head rotations, and so forth—unimodal sensory representations move continuously relative to one another. It is generally assumed that for multisensory integration to be an orderly process, it should take place between stimuli at congruent spatial locations. In the monkey posterior parietal cortex, the ventral intraparietal (VIP) area is specialized for the analysis of movement information using visual, somatosensory, vestibular, and auditory signals. Focusing on the visual and tactile modalities, we found that in area VIP, like in the superior colliculus, multisensory signals interact at the single neuron level, suggesting that this area participates in multisensory integration. Curiously, VIP does not use a single, invariant coordinate system to encode locations within and across sensory modalities. Visual stimuli can be encoded with respect to the eye, the head, or halfway between the two reference frames, whereas tactile stimuli seem to be prevalently encoded relative to the body. Hence, while some multisensory neurons in VIP could encode spatially congruent tactile and visual stimuli independently of current posture, in other neurons this would not be the case. Future work will need to evaluate the implications of these observations for theories of optimal multisensory integration.	encode;information processing;neuron;poor posture;reference frame (video);tactile imaging	Marie Avillac;Etienne Olivier;Sophie Denève;Suliann Ben Hamed;Jean-René Duhamel	2004	Cognitive Processing	10.1007/s10339-004-0021-3	psychology;reference frame;computer vision;neuroscience;coordinate system;spatial analysis;posterior parietal cortex;communication	ML	17.620610413021467	-75.62395582355516	185722

To address this issue, we used an information theory approach to analyze neuronal responses recorded in the premotor (area F5) and primary motor (area F1) cortices of macaque monkeys under four different conditions of visual feedback during hand grasping. To evaluate the sensitivity of spike timing correlation between single neurons, we investigated the stimulus dependent synchronization in our population of pairs. We first investigated the degree of correlation of trial-to-trial fluctuations in response strength between neighboring neurons for each condition, and second estimated the stimulus dependent synchronization by means of an information theoretical approach. We compared the information conveyed by pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons with the sum of information provided by the respective individual cells. The information transmission across pairs of cells in the primary motor cortex seems largely independent, whereas information transmission across pairs of premotor neurons is summed superlinearly. The brain could take advantage of both the accuracy provided by the independency of F1 and the synergy allowed by the superlinear information population coding in F5, distinguishing thus the generalizing role of F5.

435c62a045c0327bc53918d4a6714cfa95aac4e8	test–retest reliability of structural brain networks from diffusion mri	connectome;diffusion mri;test retest;human brain;network;tractography	Structural brain networks constructed from diffusion MRI (dMRI) and tractography have been demonstrated in healthy volunteers and more recently in various disorders affecting brain connectivity. However, few studies have addressed the reproducibility of the resulting networks. We measured the test-retest properties of such networks by varying several factors affecting network construction using ten healthy volunteers who underwent a dMRI protocol at 1.5T on two separate occasions. Each T1-weighted brain was parcellated into 84 regions-of-interest and network connections were identified using dMRI and two alternative tractography algorithms, two alternative seeding strategies, a white matter waypoint constraint and three alternative network weightings. In each case, four common graph-theoretic measures were obtained. Network properties were assessed both node-wise and per network in terms of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and by comparing within- and between-subject differences. Our findings suggest that test-retest performance was improved when: 1) seeding from white matter, rather than grey; and 2) using probabilistic tractography with a two-fibre model and sufficient streamlines, rather than deterministic tensor tractography. In terms of network weighting, a measure of streamline density produced better test-retest performance than tract-averaged diffusion anisotropy, although it remains unclear which is a more accurate representation of the underlying connectivity. For the best performing configuration, the global within-subject differences were between 3.2% and 11.9% with ICCs between 0.62 and 0.76. The mean nodal within-subject differences were between 5.2% and 24.2% with mean ICCs between 0.46 and 0.62. For 83.3% (70/84) of nodes, the within-subject differences were smaller than between-subject differences. Overall, these findings suggest that whilst current techniques produce networks capable of characterising the genuine between-subject differences in connectivity, future work must be undertaken to improve network reliability.	adobe streamline;algorithm;anatomic node;anisotropy;cdisc sdtm respiratory test name terminology;cerebral palsy;coefficient;coefficient;computation;computational neuroscience;conflict (psychology);connectome;connectomics;diffusion anisotropy;folic acid;global network;graph theory;hypertext transfer protocol;neoplasms;neuroinformatics;neuroscience discipline;repeatability;sample size;scanning;science;seeding;small;tract (literature);waypoint;while;white matter;algorithm	Colin R.

Signals arising from the skin convey warmth, social touch, and the physical characteristics of external stimuli. Surprising or unexpected tactile sensations can herald events of motivational salience, including imminent threats (e.g., an insect bite) and hedonic rewards (e.g., a caressing touch). Awareness of such events is thought to depend upon the hierarchical integration of body-related mismatch responses by the anterior insula. To investigate this possibility, we measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging, while healthy participants performed a roving tactile oddball task. Mass-univariate analysis demonstrated robust activations in limbic, somatosensory, and prefrontal cortical areas previously implicated in tactile deviancy, body awareness, and cognitive control. Dynamic Causal Modelling revealed that unexpected stimuli increased the strength of forward connections along a caudal to rostral hierarchy-projecting from thalamic and somatosensory regions towards insula, cingulate and prefrontal cortices. Within this ascending flow of sensory information, the AIC was the only region to show increased backwards connectivity to the somatosensory cortex, augmenting a reciprocal exchange of neuronal signals. Further, participants who rated stimulus changes as easier to detect showed stronger modulation of descending PFC to AIC connections by deviance. These results suggest that the AIC coordinates hierarchical processing of tactile prediction error. They are interpreted in support of an embodied predictive coding model where AIC mediated body awareness is involved in anchoring a global neuronal workspace.	aic gene;aicardi's syndrome;akaike information criterion;cfp gene;caudal;causality;cerebral cortex;code;cognition disorders;data point;electroencephalography;esthesia;hallucinations, tactile;hierarchical integration;inference;insect bites;insula of reil;interaction;modulation;powerbuilder foundation classes;rating (action);regression - mental defense mechanism;resonance;rewards;self-awareness;thalamic structure;top-down and bottom-up design;twelve leverage points;unidentified flying oddball;workspace;fmri	Micah Allen;Francesca Fardo;Martin J.

In this paper, we present a novel methodology based on permutation analysis and conditional mutual information for estimation of a directionality index between two neuronal populations. First, the reliability of this method is numerically assessed with a coupled mass neural model; the simulations show that this method is superior to the conditional mutual information method and the Granger causality method for identifying the coupling direction between unidirectional or bidirectional neuronal populations that are generated by the mass neuronal model. The method is also applied to investigate the coupling direction between neuronal populations in CA1 and CA3 in the rat hippocampal tetanus toxin model of focal epilepsy; the propagation direction of the seizure events could be elucidated through this coupling direction estimation method. All together, these results suggest that the permutation conditional mutual information method is a promising technique for estimating directional coupling between mutually interconnected neuronal populations.	bi-directional text;ca1 field;ca3 field;causality;coefficient;conditional mutual information;coupling constant;epilepsies, partial;epilepsy;estimated;focal (programming language);futures studies;hippocampus (brain);interaction;neural ensemble;numerical analysis;population;resting state fmri;seizures;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;tetany;xfig;tetanus toxin	Xiaoli Li;Gaoxiang Ouyang	2010	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.05.003	granger causality;machine learning;mathematics;permutation;mutual information;conditional mutual information;communication;statistics	ML	21.503125631104375	-76.60670773536113	186784

The region they comprise displays marked inter-individual variability in sulcal and gyral architecture, and although recent evidence suggests that this variability has functional significance, it is often ignored in automated and region-of-interest (ROI) morphometric investigations. This has lead to confounded interpretation of results and inconsistent findings across a number of studies and in a variety of clinical populations. In this paper, we present a reliable method for parcellating the dorsal, ventral, and subcallosal ACC and PaC that accounts for individual variation in the local cortical folding pattern. We also investigated the effect of one well characterized morphological variation, the incidence of the paracingulate sulcus (PCS), on regional volumes in 24 (12 male, 12 female) healthy participants. The presence of a PCS was shown to affect both ACC and PaC volumes, such that it was associated with an 88% increase in paracingulate cortex and a concomitant 39% decrease in cingulate cortex. These findings illustrate the potential confounds inherent in morphometric approaches that ignore or attempt to minimize inter-individual variations in sulcal and gyral anatomy and underscore the need to consider this variability when attempting to understand disease processes or characterize brain structure-function relationships.	anatomic structures;brain;cingulate cortex;heart rate variability;incidence matrix;inter-rater reliability;mental disorders;morphometric analysis;morphometrics;pancoast tumor;photon correlation spectroscopy;population;region of interest;spatial variability;dinoflagellate sulcus	Alex Fornito;Sarah Whittle;Stephen J.

Some scientists believed that the resting state activity might reflect some neural functions that consolidate the past, stabilize brain ensembles, and prepare us for the future. Here, we modeled the default network as undirected weighted graph, and then used graph theory to investigate the topological properties of the default network of the two groups of people with different intelligence levels. We found that, in both groups, the posterior cingulate cortex showed the greatest degree in comparison to the other brain regions in the default network, and that the medial temporal lobes and cerebellar tonsils were topologically separations from the other brain regions in the default network. More importantly, we found that the strength of some functional connectivities and the global efficiency of the default network were significantly different between the superior intelligence group and the average intelligence group, which indicates that the functional integration of the default network might be related to the individual intelligent performance.	cerebellum;cingulate cortex;default;functional integration;graph (discrete mathematics);graph - visual representation;graph theory;medial graph;neuroscience discipline;rest;resting state fmri;temporal lobe;tonsil	Ming Song;Yong Liu;Yuan Zhou;Kun Wang;Chunshui Yu;Tianzi Jiang	2009	2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334874	psychology;default mode network;intelligent network;neuroscience;artificial intelligence;graph theory;automation;machine learning;neurophysiology;resting state fmri;functional integration;intelligent sensor;task-positive network	AI	21.164624052963422	-78.16191455689761	188111

This paper reviews the suite of neuronal population models including neural masses, fields and conductance-based models that are used in DCM. These models are expressed in terms of sets of differential equations that allow one to model the synaptic underpinnings of connectivity. We describe early developments using neural mass models, where convolution-based dynamics are used to generate responses in laminar-specific populations of excitatory and inhibitory cells. We show that these models, though resting on only two simple transforms, can recapitulate the characteristics of both evoked and spectral responses observed empirically. Using an identical neuronal architecture, we show that a set of conductance based models-that consider the dynamics of specific ion-channels-present a richer space of responses; owing to non-linear interactions between conductances and membrane potentials. We propose that conductance-based models may be more appropriate when spectra present with multiple resonances. Finally, we outline a third class of models, where each neuronal subpopulation is treated as a field; in other words, as a manifold on the cortical surface. By explicitly accounting for the spatial propagation of cortical activity through partial differential equations (PDEs), we show that the topology of connectivity-through local lateral interactions among cortical layers-may be inferred, even in the absence of spatially resolved data. We also show that these models allow for a detailed analysis of structure-function relationships in the cortex. Our review highlights the relationship among these models and how the hypothesis asked of empirical data suggests an appropriate model class.	anatomy, regional;causal filter;conductance (graph);convolution;dicom;electroencephalography;epilepsies, partial;inference;interaction;iontophoresis;lateral thinking;magnetoencephalography;membrane potentials;neural ensemble;nonlinear system;numerical partial differential equations;population;rest;review [publication type];software propagation;synaptic package manager;anatomical layer;manifold	Rosalyn J.

Adults with dyslexia show functional deficits in several brain regions including the so-called """"Visual Word Form Area"""" (VWFA), which is implicated in visual word processing and located within the larger left occipitotemporal VWF-System. The present study examines functional connections of the left occipitotemporal VWF-System with other major language areas in children with dyslexia. Functional connectivity MRI was used to assess connectivity of the VWF-System in 18 children with dyslexia and 24 age-matched controls (age 9.7-12.5 years) using five neighboring left occipitotemporal regions of interest (ROIs) during a continuous reading task requiring phonological and orthographic processing. First, the results revealed a focal origin of connectivity from the VWF-System, in that mainly the VWFA was functionally connected with typical left frontal and parietal language areas in control children. Adjacent posterior and anterior VWF-System ROIs did not show such connectivity, confirming the special role that the VWFA plays in word processing. Second, we detected a significant disruption of functional connectivity between the VWFA and left inferior frontal and left inferior parietal language areas in the children with dyslexia. The current findings add to our understanding of dyslexia by showing that functional disconnection of the left occipitotemporal system is limited to the small VWFA region crucial for automatic visual word processing, and emerges early during reading acquisition in children with dyslexia, along with deficits in orthographic and phonological processing of visual word forms."""	area striata structure;cognition disorders;denial-of-service attack;dyslexia;focal (programming language);large;orthographic projection;region of interest;resting state fmri;schema (genetic algorithms);vwf gene;visual word;frontal lobe	Sanne van der Mark;Peter Klaver;Kerstin Bucher;Urs Maurer;Enrico Schulz;Silvia Brem;Ernst Martin;Daniel Brandeis	2011	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.10.002	psychology;cognitive psychology;dyslexia;developmental psychology;radiology;medicine;communication;region of interest	HCI	19.58702847813711	-78.72184600181072	188933
c3e6edbe1257cddcd4e5f31139a12f54ce270585	dependence of excitability indices on membrane channel dynamics, myelin impedance, electrode location and stimulus waveforms in myelinated and unmyelinated fibre models	electrostimulation;a-fibres;c-fibres;strength-duration;rheobase	Neuronal excitability is determined in a complex way by several interacting factors, such as membrane dynamics, fibre geometry, electrode configuration, myelin impedance, neuronal terminations … $\dots $ This study aims to increase understanding in excitability, by investigating the impact of these factors on different models of myelinated and unmyelinated fibres (five well-known membrane models are combined with three electrostimulation models, that take into account the spatial structure of the neuron). Several excitability indices (rheobase, polarity ratio, bi/monophasic ratio, time constants … $\dots $) are calculated during extensive parameter sweeps, allowing us to obtain novel findings on how these factors interact, e.g. how the dependency of excitability indices on the fibre diameter and myelin impedance is influenced by the electrode location and membrane dynamics. It was found that excitability is profoundly impacted by the used membrane model and the location of the neuronal terminations. The approximation of infinite myelin impedance was investigated by two implementations of the spatially extended non-linear node model. The impact of this approximation on the time constant of strength-duration plots is significant, most importantly in the Frankenhaeuser-Huxley membrane model for large electrode-neuron separations. Finally, a multi-compartmental model for C-fibres is used to determine the impact of the absence of internodes on excitability. Graphical AbstractElectrostimulation models, obtained by combining five membrane models with three representations of the neuronal cable equation, are fed with electrode and stimulus input parameters. The dependency of neuronal excitability on the interaction of these input parameters is determined by deriving excitability indices from the spatiotemporal model response. The impact of the myelin impedance and the fibre diameter on neural excitability is also considered.	anatomic node;approximation;cable theory;characteristic impedance;diameter (qualifier value);excited state;graphical user interface;huxley: the dystopia;impacted tooth;interaction;ion channel;multi-compartment model;myelin p0 protein;myelin sheath;neuron;nonlinear system;numerous;population parameter;quantitative impedance;tissue membrane;emotional dependency;polarity	Thomas Tarnaud;Wout Joseph;Luc Martens;Emmeric Tanghe	2018	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-018-1799-y	myelin;biophysics;electronic engineering;electrode;membrane;time constant;electrical impedance;mathematics;neuron;membrane channel;rheobase	ML	20.071409274535057	-73.92302689353039	189127

While functional neuroimaging studies have focused on memory for emotional but not for neutral stimuli, in order to probe amygdala function, structural imaging studies have tied episodic memory to hippocampal function. We therefore investigated the neural correlates of episodic memory formation for neutral stimuli in 20 patients with a first depressive episode, 20 patients recovered from a first episode and 20 healthy controls. Because there is evidence that the amygdala exhibits hyperactive responses even to neutral stimuli in depressed subjects, we specifically explored the potential role of the amygdala in forming episodic memories with neutral content. Both patient groups showed stronger subsequent memory effects in the amygdala when compared to controls, in the absence of any differences in hippocampal activity between groups. Patients with a first episode of MDD showed increased activity related to episodic memory formation in a fronto-limbic network. These state-related activations may be related to a compensatory mechanism, which is supported by the absence of any differences in memory performance between groups. These findings represent initial evidence for a neurocognitive trait or vulnerability marker of depression-amygdala involvement in episodic memory formation of neutral stimuli.	amygdaloid structure;cognition disorders;consciousness;exhibits as topic;functional neuroimaging;hyperactive behavior;major depressive disorder;medical imaging;memory disorders;memory, episodic;patients;neurocognitive	Philip van Eijndhoven;Guido A. van Wingen;Guillén Fernández;Mark Rijpkema;Robbert Jan Verkes;Jan K.

Independent component analysis (ICA) can provide a way of decomposition by maximizing the mutual independence of separated components. Beyond the temporal profile and topography provided by ICA, this work aims to estimate and map the cortical source distribution for each component. The proposed method first constructs a source space using lead field vectors for vertices on the cortical surface. By projecting the specified components to this source space, our method provides the corresponding spatiotemporal maps for these independent brain activities.

60f2ee9ab1180d3736eff2fa412f01e66eb3ef55	modeling resting state fmri data via longitudinal supervised stochastic coordinate coding		Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) has been used widely to explore intrinsic brain activities and networks. Although there are a large number of model-driven and data-driven methods that have been employed to model rsfMRI data, it is challenging to model longitudinal rsfMRI data given the time gaps. Currently, sparse dictionary learning (SDL) method has already shown great promise and attracted increasing attention in the rsfMRI research field. The vital advantage of this SDL methodology is that it can identify concurrent brain networks efficiently and systematically. However, the current SDL is not directly applicable to longitudinal rsfMRI data with multiple time points. In response, we propose a longitudinal supervised stochastic coordinate coding (LSSCC) algorithm for longitudinal rsfMRI data analysis. At the first time point, concurrent brain networks are learned and approximated based on the spatial network templates by SDL with l2 norm. Then, the learned networks at the first time point are transferred to the following time points and the LSSCC is employed to conduct the approximations of functional networks longitudinally. The application of LSSCC on the ADNI-2 longitudinal rsfMRI datasets has shown the effectiveness of our proposed methods.	approximation algorithm;machine learning;model-driven integration;resting state fmri;sparse dictionary learning;sparse matrix;spatial network	Wei Zhang;Jinglei Lv;Shu Zhang;Yu Zhao;Tianming Liu	2018	2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018)	10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363538	coding (social sciences);pattern recognition;resting state fmri;artificial intelligence;computer science;norm (mathematics);spatial network	DB	23.19075251088574	-74.99754287454044	191605
1dbe13c03cce346eca0275a938eeee287dd2cb60	same clock, different time read-out: spontaneous brain oscillations and their relationship to deficient coding of cognitive content	journal_article;article letter to editor	Neuronal oscillations provide an efficient means of communication, fostering functional neural states supporting action and reaction. High in the action hierarchy, cognitive abilities are severely compromised in neuropsychiatric disease such as schizophrenia. Current thinking highlights a clocking mechanism provided by the phase of an ongoing slow oscillation that offers a temporal frame for coding of perceptual and computational elements. Yet unclear is whether and how a dysregulated clocking mechanism accounts for diminished cognitive performance. Neuromagnetic oscillatory activity was related to cognitive performance assessed by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery in 58 healthy individuals (HC) and 46 schizophrenia patients (SZ). HC showed a correlation between gamma-band oscillations (>40 Hz) and working memory performance. This relationship was disrupted in several ways in SZ. First, patients evidenced lower gamma power, poorer working memory performance, and no relationship between these measures. Second, the power spectra were dominated by ~10 Hz alpha oscillations with no group differences in amplitude. However, analysis of phase-to-amplitude coupling (PAC) revealed exaggerated clocking of gamma activity by alpha phase in SZ, associated with poor working memory performance. Third, despite entrainment by the same 10 Hz clock, gamma amplitude was abnormally distributed across the duty cycle in SZ, a potential consequence of compromised interneuron inhibition. Fourth, SZ showed over-engagement of a fronto-parietal network measured by gamma phase coherence, suggesting a brain state hindering cognitive output. Such an endogenous temporal organization may be a core dysfunction in SZ: a segregation/integration input imbalance fostering reduced cognitive performance and compromised behavioral output.	brainwave entrainment;clock rate;cognition;duty cycle;hertz (hz);interferon type ii;interneurons;memory disorders;neural oscillation;parkinson disease;patients;schizophrenia;spontaneous order	Tzvetan Popov;Petia Popova	2015	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.06.071	psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;artificial intelligence;communication	HCI	17.461358932459834	-78.02981231129307	191781

One skill that develops over time is the ability to problem solve, which in turn relies on cognitive control and attention abilities. Here we use a novel multimodal neurocognitive network-based approach combining task-related fMRI, resting-state fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the maturation of control processes underlying problem solving skills in 7-9 year-old children. Our analysis focused on two key neurocognitive networks implicated in a wide range of cognitive tasks including control: the insula-cingulate salience network, anchored in anterior insula (AI), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, and the fronto-parietal central executive network, anchored in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). We found that, by age 9, the AI node of the salience network is a major causal hub initiating control signals during problem solving. Critically, despite stronger AI activation, the strength of causal regulatory influences from AI to the PPC node of the central executive network was significantly weaker and contributed to lower levels of behavioral performance in children compared to adults. These results were validated using two different analytic methods for estimating causal interactions in fMRI data. In parallel, DTI-based tractography revealed weaker AI-PPC structural connectivity in children. Our findings point to a crucial role of AI connectivity, and its causal cross-network influences, in the maturation of dynamic top-down control signals underlying cognitive development. Overall, our study demonstrates how a unified neurocognitive network model when combined with multimodal imaging enhances our ability to generalize beyond individual task-activated foci and provides a common framework for elucidating key features of brain and cognitive development. The quantitative approach developed is likely to be useful in investigating neurodevelopmental disorders, in which control processes are impaired, such as autism and ADHD.	anatomic node;anatomical maturation;anterior insula;aortic valve insufficiency;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;autistic disorder;biologic development;causal filter;causal system;cingulate cortex;cognition;developmental reading disorder;diffusion tensor imaging;estimated;insula of reil;multimodal imaging;multimodal interaction;network model;neurodevelopmental disorders;parietal lobe;posterior parietal cortex;prefrontal cortex;problem solving (mental process);rest;resting state fmri;top-down and bottom-up design;usb hub;cognitive development;neurocognitive	Kaustubh Supekar;Vinod Menon	2012		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002374	cognition;magnetic resonance imaging;cognitive development;child development	AI	19.391490731803046	-78.38295423350682	192478
2df65c0e58b12f86f1a6f4b3ee0accdad1ce0f30	regional homogeneity of intrinsic brain activity correlates with auditory-motor processing of vocal pitch errors	auditory feedback;auditory-vocal integration;intrinsic brain activity;regional homogeneity;resting-state fmri	It has been well documented that speakers produce rapid compensatory vocal adjustments for errors they perceive in their auditory feedback. The fact that they differ greatly in the degree to which they compensate for perceived errors, however, has received much less attention. The present study investigated whether intrinsic brain activity during resting can predict an individual's behavioral and cortical responses in compensating for pitch-shifted auditory feedback during vocalization. This relationship was investigated by correlating the regional homogeneity (ReHo) of resting-state fMRI signals with the vocal compensation and event-related potentials (N1 and P2) in response to pitch shifts of -200 and -500 cents. Behaviorally, the magnitudes of vocal compensation were significantly correlated with the ReHo values in the right supplementary motor area (SMA) for both -200 and -500 cents, the right primary motor cortex (M1) for -200 cents, and the left premotor cortex (PMC) for -500 cents. For both pitch shift sizes, there were significant correlations between ReHo and N1 amplitude in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), right superior temporal gyrus (STG), bilateral M1, and left SMA. Significant correlations between ReHo and P2 amplitude were observed in the bilateral IFG, right STG, left SMA and M1 for -200 and -500 cents, the left PMC for -200 cents, and the right SMA for -500 cents. These findings provide the first evidence that regional homogeneity of intrinsic brain activity can predict behavioral and cortical responses in compensating for pitch errors in voice auditory feedback.	bilateral filter;cerebral cortex;crohn disease;document completion status - documented;erp;electroencephalography;frontal lobe gyrus;ifng gene;ifng wt allele;index;inferior frontal gyrus;natural science disciplines;phenylmercuric chloride;pitch (music);pitch shift;rest;resting state fmri;rheum australe;star trek generations;superior temporal gyrus;usp9x gene;vocal cord paralysis;vocal cord structure;auditory feedback;funding grant;mesial premotor cortex;primary motor cortex	Zhiqiang Guo;Xiyan Huang;Meng Wang;Jeffery A.

Receipt of a reward at the expected time allows to compute reward-prediction errors which can drive learning in motor or cognitive structures. Reciprocally, dopamine plays an important role in the timing of external events. Several models of the dopaminergic system exist, but the substrate of temporal learning is rather unclear. In this article, we propose a neuro-computational model of the afferent network to the ventral tegmental area, including the lateral hypothalamus, the pedunculopontine nucleus, the amygdala, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the ventral basal ganglia (including the nucleus accumbens and the ventral pallidum), as well as the lateral habenula and the rostromedial tegmental nucleus. Based on a plausible connectivity and realistic learning rules, this neuro-computational model reproduces several experimental observations, such as the progressive cancelation of dopaminergic bursts at reward delivery, the appearance of bursts at the onset of reward-predicting cues or the influence of reward magnitude on activity in the amygdala and ventral tegmental area. While associative learning occurs primarily in the amygdala, learning of the temporal relationship between the cue and the associated reward is implemented as a dopamine-modulated coincidence detection mechanism in the nucleus accumbens.	amygdaloid structure;average-case complexity;basal (phylogenetics);basal ganglia;cell nucleus;computation (action);computational model;conditioning (psychology);conditioning, classical;dopamine hydrochloride;globus pallidus;habenula;hypothalamic area, lateral;hypothalamic structure;lateral thinking;modulation;nucleus accumbens;onset (audio);pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus;prefrontal cortex;rewards;rule (guideline);temporal logic;ventral tegmental area	Julien Vitay;Fred Henrik Hamker	2014		10.3389/fnbot.2014.00004	psychology;cognitive psychology;classical conditioning;olfactory tubercle;dopamine;neuroscience;developmental psychology;bioinformatics;brain stimulation reward;reward system	ML	17.99145952537218	-73.18786742621221	192920

In particular, we show how hidden Markov models (HMMs) can be used to model and analyze sequences of neural activity, and how the resulting joint probability of an observation sequence and an underlying sequence of states naturally lead to the development of a two component sequence score in which the sequential and contextual information are decoupled. We also show how this score can discriminate between true and shuffled sequences of hippocampal neural activity.	hidden markov model;markov chain;neural oscillation;refinement (computing);replay attack	Etienne R.

In order to extract high-dimensional information for computational neuroscience applications standardized data fusion and efficient reduction into integrative data structures are required. Such self-consistent multimodal data sets can be used for computational brain modeling to constrain models with individual measurable features of the brain, such as done with The Virtual Brain (TVB). TVB is a simulation platform that uses empirical structural and functional data to build full brain models of individual humans. For convenient model construction, we developed a processing pipeline for structural, functional and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and optionally electroencephalography (EEG) data. The pipeline combines several state-of-the-art neuroinformatics tools to generate subject-specific cortical and subcortical parcellations, surface-tessellations, structural and functional connectomes, lead field matrices, electrical source activity estimates and region-wise aggregated blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) time-series. The output files of the pipeline can be directly uploaded to TVB to create and simulate individualized large-scale network models that incorporate intra- and intercortical interaction on the basis of cortical surface triangulations and white matter tractograpy. We detail the pitfalls of the individual processing streams and discuss ways of validation. With the pipeline we also introduce novel ways of estimating the transmission strengths of fiber tracts in whole-brain structural connectivity (SC) networks and compare the outcomes of different tractography or parcellation approaches. We tested the functionality of the pipeline on 50 multimodal data sets. In order to quantify the robustness of the connectome extraction part of the pipeline we computed several metrics that quantify its rescan reliability and compared them to other tractography approaches. Together with the pipeline we present several principles to guide future efforts to standardize brain model construction. The code of the pipeline and the fully processed data sets are made available to the public via The Virtual Brain website (thevirtualbrain.org) and via github (https://github.com/BrainModes/TVB-empirical-data-pipeline). Furthermore, the pipeline can be directly used with High Performance Computing (HPC) resources on the Neuroscience Gateway Portal (http://www.nsgportal.org) through a convenient web-interface.	brain neoplasms;computation;computational neuroscience;connectome;data structure;diffusion weighted imaging;electroencephalography phase synchronization;estimated;magnetic resonance imaging;multimodal interaction;neuroimaging;neuroinformatics;personalization;simulation;time series;tissue fiber;user interface;white matter;blood oxygen level dependent;fmri	Michael Schirner;Simon Rothmeier;Viktor K.

Studies with TMS have suggested that the right hemispheric network, but not the left, is functionally relevant for visuospatial judgments. However, very little is still known about the interactions within these fronto-parietal networks underlying visuospatial processing. In the current study, we investigated task modulation of functional connectivity (instantaneous correlations of regional time courses), and task-specific effective connectivity (direction of influences), within the right fronto-parietal network activated during visuospatial judgments. Ten healthy volunteers performed a behaviorally controlled visuospatial judgment task (ANGLE) or a control task (COLOR) in an fMRI experiment. Visuospatial task-specific activations were found in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and middle/inferior frontal gyrus (MFG). Functional connectivity within this network was task-modulated, with significantly higher connectivity between PPC and MFG during ANGLE than during COLOR. Effective connectivity analysis for directed influence revealed that visuospatial task-specific projections within this network were predominantly in a frontal-to-parietal direction. Moreover, ANGLE-specific influences from thalamic nuclei to PPC were identified. Exploratory effective connectivity analysis revealed that closely neighboring clusters, within visuospatial regions, were differentially involved in the network. These neighboring clusters had opposite effective connectivity patterns to other nodes of the fronto-parietal network. Our data thus reveal that visuospatial judgments are supported by massive fronto-parietal backprojections, thalamo-parietal influence, and multiple stages, or loops, of information flow within the visuospatial network. We speculate on possible functional contributions of the various network nodes and informational loops in a neurocognitive model.	bilateral filter;exploratory testing;frontal lobe gyrus;functional imaging;inferior frontal gyrus;information flow (information theory);interaction;judgment (mathematical logic);lateral occipitotemporal gyrus;modulation;parietal lobe;posterior parietal cortex;projection defense mechanism;resting state fmri;spatial–temporal reasoning;thalamic nuclei;thalamic structure;transcranial magnetic stimulation;neurocognitive	Tom A. de Graaf;Alard Roebroeck;Rainer Goebel;Alexander Thomas Sack	2010	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn.2009.21345	psychology;cognitive psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;radiology;posterior parietal cortex;communication	ML	19.58023225744656	-77.59103006387369	194169

In the temporal dimension, we describe the shape of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) with a transfer function model. The spatial continuity and local homogeneity of the evoked responses are modelled by a Gaussian Markov random field prior on the parameter indicating activations. The proposal constitutes an extension of the spatiotemporal model presented in a previous approach [Quirós, A., Montes Diez, R. and Gamerman, D., 2010. Bayesian spatiotemporal model of fMRI data, Neuroimage, 49: 442-456], offering more flexibility in the estimation of the HRF and computational advantages in the resulting MCMC algorithm. Simulations from the model are performed in order to ascertain the performance of the sampling scheme and the ability of the posterior to estimate model parameters, as well as to check the model sensitivity to signal to noise ratio. Results are shown on synthetic data and on a real data set from a block-design fMRI experiment.	algorithm;computer simulation;forty nine;frequency response;function model;hemodynamics;markov chain monte carlo;markov random field;normal statistical distribution;population parameter;sampling (signal processing);scott continuity;signal-to-noise ratio;synthetic data;transfer function;fmri	Alicia Quirós Carretero;Raquel Montes Diez;Simon P.

As recently shown in a proof of concept clinical trial, acoustic coordinated reset (CR) neuromodulation causes a significant relief of tinnitus symptoms combined with a significant decrease of pathological oscillatory activity in a network comprising auditory and non-auditory brain areas. The objective of the present study was to analyze whether CR therapy caused an alteration of the effective connectivity in a tinnitus related network of localized EEG brain sources. To determine which connections matter, in a first step, we considered a larger network of brain sources previously associated with tinnitus. To that network we applied a data-driven approach, combining empirical mode decomposition and partial directed coherence analysis, in patients with bilateral tinnitus before and after 12 weeks of CR therapy as well as in healthy controls. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, we focused on the good responders, classified by a reliable-change-index (RCI). Prior to CR therapy and compared to the healthy controls, the good responders showed a significantly increased connectivity between the left primary cortex auditory cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex in the gamma and delta bands together with a significantly decreased effective connectivity between the right primary auditory cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the alpha band. Intriguingly, after 12 weeks of CR therapy most of the pathological interactions were gone, so that the connectivity patterns of good responders and healthy controls became statistically indistinguishable. In addition, we used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to examine the types of interactions which were altered by CR therapy. Our DCM results show that CR therapy specifically counteracted the imbalance of excitation and inhibition. CR significantly weakened the excitatory connection between posterior cingulate cortex and primary auditory cortex and significantly strengthened inhibitory connections between auditory cortices and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The overall impact of CR therapy on the entire tinnitus-related network showed up as a qualitative transformation of its spectral response, in terms of a drastic change of the shape of its averaged transfer function. Based on our findings we hypothesize that CR therapy restores a silence based cognitive auditory comparator function of the posterior cingulate cortex.	acoustic cryptanalysis;artificial neural network;auditory area;auditory processing disorder;bands;bilateral filter;biological neural networks;cns disorder;causal filter;cerebral cortex;cingulate cortex;classification;comparator device component;dicom;electroencephalography;excitation;hearing problem;hilbert–huang transform;interaction;large;neuromodulation (medicine);patients;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;prefrontal cortex;signal-to-noise ratio;transfer function	Alexander N.

The most comprehensive model to date of the BOLD signal is formulated as a mixed continuous discrete time system of nonlinear stochastic differential equations. Previous approaches have been based on linear approximations of the dynamics, which are limited in their ability to capture the inherent nonlinearities in the physiological system. A dual particle filter is proposed to simultaneous estimate the hidden physiological states and the system parameters in this paper, the sufficient statistics is adopted to deal with sampling degeneracy phenomena and the beta distribution which makes good use of prior knowledge as well as avoids tail draws for the parameter is used to fit the parametric posteriori probability density function. This approach applied to phantom data and human subjects. The results showed that state estimates via simulation are accurate, robust and efficient in comparison to linearization-based technique and physiologically reasonable parameter estimates are generated for experimental fMRI data.

These studies have been limited to the visual cortex because of its high energy metabolism and good magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) sensitivity using surface coil. The aim of this study was to extend functional MRS (fMRS) to investigate for the first time the metabolite changes during motor activation at 7T. Small but sustained increases in lactate (0.17μmol/g±0.05μmol/g, p<0.001) and glutamate (0.17μmol/g±0.09μmol/g, p<0.005) were detected during motor activation followed by a return to the baseline after the end of activation. The present study demonstrates that increases in lactate and glutamate during motor stimulation are small, but similar to those observed during visual stimulation. From the observed glutamate and lactate increase, we inferred that these metabolite changes may be a general manifestation of the increased neuronal activity. In addition, we propose that the measured metabolite concentration increases imply an increase in ΔCMRO2 that is transiently below that of ΔCMRGlc during the first 1 to 2min of the stimulation.	baseline (configuration management);cerebral cortex;coil device component;glutamic acid;heat shock proteins;inference;lactic acid;magnetic resonance spectroscopy;minimal recursion semantics;photic stimulation;snap25 protein, human;snap25 wt allele;tesla - unit	Benoît Schaller;Lijing Xin;Kieran O'Brien;Arthur W.

Cross correlation of the response (EEG, MEG, ERG, or fMRI) with the m-sequence results in a series of response kernels for each response channel and each stimulus patch. In the past the number and complexity of stimulus patches has been constrained by graphics hardware, namely the use of look-up-table (LUT) animation methods. To avoid such limitations we replaced the LUTs with true color graphic sprites to present arbitrary spatial patterns. To demonstrate the utility of the method we have recorded simultaneously from 192 cortically scaled stimulus patches each of which activate about 12mm of cortex in area V1. Because of the sparseness of cortical folding, very small stimulus patches and robust estimation of dipole source orientation, the method opens a new window on precise spatio-temporal mapping of early visual areas. The use of sprites also enables multiplexing stimuli such that at each patch location multiple stimuli can be presented. We have presented patterns with different orientations (or spatial frequencies) at the same patch locations but independently temporally modulated, effectively doubling the number of stimulus patches, to explore cell population interactions at the same cortical locus. We have also measured nonlinear responses to adjacent pairs of patches, thereby getting an edge response that doubles the spatial sampling density to about 1.8 mm on cortex.	color depth;electroencephalography;graphics hardware;interaction;locus;lookup table;magnetoencephalography;modulation;multiplexing;neural coding;nonlinear system;patch (computing);period-doubling bifurcation;sampling (signal processing);sprite (computer graphics)	Thom Carney;Justin Ales;Stanley A.

Intrinsic coupling has been investigated in electrophysiological recordings using two types of functional connectivity measures: amplitude and phase coupling. These two coupling modes differ in their likely causes and functions, and have been proposed to provide complementary insights into intrinsic neuronal interactions. Here, we investigate the relationship between amplitude and phase coupling in source-reconstructed electroencephalography (EEG). Volume conduction is a key obstacle for connectivity analysis in EEG-we therefore also test the envelope correlation of orthogonalized signals and the phase lag index. Functional connectivity between six seed source regions (bilateral visual, sensorimotor, and auditory cortices) and all other cortical voxels was computed. For all four measures, coupling between homologous sensory areas in both hemispheres was significantly higher than with other voxels at the same physical distance. The frequency of significant coupling differed between sensory areas: 10 Hz for visual, 30 Hz for auditory, and 40 Hz for sensorimotor cortices. By contrasting envelope correlations and phase locking values, we observed two distinct clusters of voxels showing a different relationship between amplitude and phase coupling. Large clusters contiguous to the seed regions showed an identity (1:1) relationship between amplitude and phase coupling, whereas a cluster located around the contralateral homologous regions showed higher phase than amplitude coupling. These results show a relationship between intrinsic coupling modes that is distinct from the effect of volume conduction.	1:1 pixel mapping;auditory processing disorder;bilateral filter;coupling constant;electroencephalography phase synchronization;hertz (hz);homology (biology);interaction;lock (computer science);loose coupling;magnetoencephalography;network architecture;neural oscillation;neuroimaging;rest;resting state fmri;stmn1 gene;sensorimotor cortex;spatiotemporal pattern;voxel	Saeid Mehrkanoon;Michael Breakspear;Juliane Britz;Tjeerd W.

Magnetic seizure therapy (MST), which induces therapeutic seizures with high dose repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, has been introduced to improve the seizure therapy risk/benefit ratio. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding of seizure therapy's underlying mechanisms of action. In this study, we apply graph theory-based connectivity analysis to peri-treatment, resting-state, topographical electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with depression receiving seizure therapy. Functional connectivity was assessed using the de-biased weighted phase lag index, a measure of EEG phase synchronization. Brain network structure was quantified using graph theory metrics, including betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient, network density, and characteristic path length. We found a significant reduction in the phase synchronization and aberration of the small-world architecture in the beta frequency band, which could be related to acute clinical and cognitive effects of seizure therapy.	antidepressive agents;betweenness centrality;clustering coefficient;depressive disorder;electroconvulsive therapy;electroencephalography phase synchronization;electronic circuit;frequency band;graph - visual representation;graph theory;interphase cell;network architecture;network governance;patients;rest;stmn1 wt allele;seizures;topography;transcranial magnetic stimulation;statistical cluster	Zhi-De Deng;Shawn M.

8e1980218d76e0f4192e19dc80320866c5f13a1a	a new modelling framework to study time-varying directional brain-heart interactions: preliminary evaluations and perspectives		We propose a novel modelling framework to study non-stationary, directional brain-heart interplay in a time varying fashion. Considering electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) series as inputs, a new multivariate formulation is derived from proper coupling functions linking cortical electrical activity and heartbeat dynamics generation models. These neural-autonomic coupling rules are formalised according to the current knowledge on the central autonomic network and fully parametrised in adaptive coefficients quantifying the information outflow from-brain-to- heart as well as from-heart-to-brain. Such coefficients can be effectively estimated by solving the model inverse problem, and profitably exploited for a novel assessment of brain-heart interactions. Here we show preliminary experimental results gathered from 27 healthy volunteers undergoing significant sympatho-vagal perturbations through cold-pressor test and discuss prospective uses of this novel methodological frame- work. Specifically, we highlight how the directional brain-heart coupling significantly increases during prolonged baroreflex elicitation with specific time delays and throughout specific brain areas, especially including fronto-parietal regions and lateralisation mechanisms in the temporal cortices.	autonomic computing;autonomic networking;baroreflex;coefficient;electroencephalography;heart rate variability;interaction;parietal lobe;prospective search;rule (guideline);stationary process;temporal lobe	Vincenzo Catrambone;Alberto Greco;Mimma Nardelli;Shadi Ghiasi;Nicola Vanello;Enzo Pasquale Scilingo;Gaetano Valenza	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513113	heart rate variability;computer vision;heartbeat;coupling;outflow;electroencephalography;multivariate statistics;baroreflex;inverse problem;computer science;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence	Robotics	21.200629154260746	-77.11400765350892	197612

In most cases static networks are studied, often relying on resting state recordings. Here, we present a quantitative study of dynamic reconfiguration of connectivity for event-related experiments. Our motivation is the development of a methodology that can be used for personalized monitoring of brain activity. In line with this motivation, we use data with visual stimuli from a typical subject that participated in different experiments that were previously analyzed with traditional methods. The earlier studies identified well-defined changes in specific brain areas at specific latencies related to attention, properties of stimuli, and tasks demands. Using a recently introduced methodology, we track the event-related changes in network organization, at source space level, thus providing a more global and complete view of the stages of processing associated with the regional changes in activity. The results suggest the time evolving modularity as an additional brain code that is accessible with noninvasive means and hence available for personalized monitoring and clinical applications.	description;electroencephalography;experiment;mathematics;network governance;neuroimaging;personalization;rest;resting state fmri	Andreas A.

1057ddfa6ce75e99f0820cc8e4ac7f677a796fba	from intentions to actions: neural oscillations encode motor processes through phase, amplitude and phase-amplitude coupling	phase amplitude coupling;motor intention;phase;intracranial eeg;motor planning;neural oscillations	Goal-directed motor behavior is associated with changes in patterns of rhythmic neuronal activity across widely distributed brain areas. In particular, movement initiation and execution are mediated by patterns of synchronization and desynchronization that occur concurrently across distinct frequency bands and across multiple motor cortical areas. To date, motor-related local oscillatory modulations have been predominantly examined by quantifying increases or suppressions in spectral power. However, beyond signal power, spectral properties such as phase and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) have also been shown to carry information with regards to the oscillatory dynamics underlying motor processes. Yet, the distinct functional roles of phase, amplitude and PAC across the planning and execution of goal-directed motor behavior remain largely elusive. Here, we address this question with unprecedented resolution thanks to multi-site intracerebral EEG recordings in human subjects while they performed a delayed motor task. To compare the roles of phase, amplitude and PAC, we monitored intracranial brain signals from 748 sites across six medically intractable epilepsy patients at movement execution, and during the delay period where motor intention is present but execution is withheld. In particular, we used a machine-learning framework to identify the key contributions of various neuronal responses. We found a high degree of overlap between brain network patterns observed during planning and those present during execution. Prominent amplitude increases in the delta (2-4Hz) and high gamma (60-200Hz) bands were observed during both planning and execution. In contrast, motor alpha (8-13Hz) and beta (13-30Hz) power were suppressed during execution, but enhanced during the delay period. Interestingly, single-trial classification revealed that low-frequency phase information, rather than spectral power change, was the most discriminant feature in dissociating action from intention. Additionally, despite providing weaker decoding, PAC features led to statistically significant classification of motor states, particularly in anterior cingulate cortex and premotor brain areas. These results advance our understanding of the distinct and partly overlapping involvement of phase, amplitude and the coupling between them, in the neuronal mechanisms underlying motor intentions and executions.	bands;cingulate cortex;cognitive function: initiation;coupling (computer programming);discriminant;drug resistant epilepsy;electroencephalography;encode (action);frequency band;intention - mental process;machine learning;motor neuron disease;neural oscillation;numerous;patients;synchronization (computer science)	Etienne Combrisson;Marcela Perrone-Bertolotti;Juan L.

66f4e166da28fe25e5145db7e37ee8dd3d8df6da	development of the error-monitoring system from ages 9–35: unique insight provided by mri-constrained source localization of eeg	development;source localization;ern;error monitoring;posterior cingulate;adolescence	The ability to self-detect errors and dynamically adapt behavior is a cornerstone of higher-level cognition, requiring coordinated activity from a network of neural regions. However, disagreement exists over how the error-monitoring system develops throughout adolescence and early adulthood. The present report leveraged MRI-constrained EEG source localization to detail typical development of the error-monitoring system in a sample of 9-35 year-olds (n = 43). Participants performed a flanker task while high-density EEG was recorded; structural MRIs were also acquired for all participants. Analysis of the scalp-recorded EEG data revealed a frontocentral negativity (error-related negativity; ERN) immediately following errors for all participants, although the topography of the ERN varied with age. Source localization of the ERN time range revealed maximal activity within the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) for all ages, consistent with recent evidence that the PCC provides a substantial contribution to the scalp-recorded ERN. Activity within a network of brain regions, including dorsal anterior cingulate, PCC, and parietal cortex, was predictive of improved performance following errors, regardless of age. However, additional activity within insula, orbitofrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus linearly increased with age. Together, these data suggest that the core error-monitoring system is online by early adolescence and remains relatively stable into adulthood. However, additional brain regions become embedded within this core network with age. These results serve as a model of typical development of the error-monitoring system from early adolescence into adulthood.	cognition;electroencephalography;embedded system;embedding;frontal lobe gyrus;inferior frontal gyrus;insula of reil;maximal set;negativity (quantum mechanics);parietal lobe;portable c compiler;posterior cingulate cortex;topography	George A.

Multivariate analysis across multiple fMRI tasks may increase the sensitivity of fMRI-based diagnosis. Prior research using multi-task analysis in fMRI, such as those that use joint independent component analysis (jICA), has mainly assumed that brain activity patterns evoked by different tasks are independent. This may not be valid in practice. Here, we use sparsity, which is a natural characteristic of fMRI data in the spatial domain, and propose a joint sparse representation analysis (jSRA) method to identify common information across different functional subtraction (contrast) images in data from a multi-task fMRI experiment. Sparse representation methods do not require independence, or that the brain activity patterns be nonoverlapping. We use functional subtraction images within the joint sparse representation analysis to generate joint activation sources and their corresponding sparse modulation profiles. We evaluate the use of sparse representation analysis to capture individual differences with simulated fMRI data and with experimental fMRI data. The experimental fMRI data was acquired from 16 young (age: 19-26) and 16 older (age: 57-73) adults obtained from multiple speech comprehension tasks within subjects, where an independent measure (namely, age in years) can be used to differentiate between groups. Simulation results show that this method yields greater sensitivity, precision, and higher Jaccard indexes (which measures similarity and diversity of the true and estimated brain activation sources) than does the jICA method. Moreover, superiority of the jSRA method in capturing individual differences was successfully demonstrated using experimental fMRI data.	assumed;computer multitasking;electroencephalography;independent component analysis;jaccard index;magnetic resonance imaging;modulation;mood disorders;numerous;simulation;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;task analysis;fmri	Mahdi Ramezani;Kris Marble;H.

6a8cab4868af545fb9d7f6104048ee5270fb9a17	a machine learning methodology for the selection and classification of spontaneous spinal cord dorsum potentials allows disclosure of structured (non-random) changes in neuronal connectivity induced by nociceptive stimulation	sorting of spontaneous cord dorsum potentials;biological patents;biomedical journals;text mining;spinal cord;europe pubmed central;citation search;neural signal processing;cord dorsum potentials;citation networks;data analysis;discovery and classification;machine learning;research articles;spontaneous neuronal activity;abstracts;neural signals processing;open access;life sciences;clinical guidelines;capsaicin;full text;article;rest apis;orcids;europe pmc;biomedical research;bioinformatics;literature search	Previous studies aimed to disclose the functional organization of the neuronal networks involved in the generation of the spontaneous cord dorsum potentials (CDPs) generated in the lumbosacral spinal segments used predetermined templates to select specific classes of spontaneous CDPs. Since this procedure was time consuming and required continuous supervision, it was limited to the analysis of two specific types of CDPs (negative CDPs and negative positive CDPs), thus excluding potentials that may reflect activation of other neuronal networks of presumed functional relevance. We now present a novel procedure based in machine learning that allows the efficient and unbiased selection of a variety of spontaneous CDPs with different shapes and amplitudes. The reliability and performance of the present method is evaluated by analyzing the effects on the probabilities of generation of different classes of spontaneous CDPs induced by the intradermic injection of small amounts of capsaicin in the anesthetized cat, a procedure known to induce a state of central sensitization leading to allodynia and hyperalgesia. The results obtained with the selection method presently described allowed detection of spontaneous CDPs with specific shapes and amplitudes that are assumed to represent the activation of functionally coupled sets of dorsal horn neurones that acquire different, structured configurations in response to nociceptive stimuli. These changes are considered as responses tending to adequate transmission of sensory information to specific functional requirements as part of homeostatic adjustments.	assumed;back;cns disorder;capsaicin;class;clinical use template;deep brain stimulation;disclosure;functional requirement;homeostasis;hyperalgesia;machine learning;probability;randomness;relevance;sensitization (observable entity);spinal cord neoplasms;spontaneous order;structure of posterior gray horn of spinal cord	Mario Martín;Enrique Contreras;Javier Béjar;Gennaro Esposito;Diógenes Chávez;Silvio Glusman;Ulises Cortés;Pablo Rudomín	2015		10.3389/fninf.2015.00021	text mining;neuroscience;computer science;bioinformatics;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data analysis;communication	ML	19.117398270792865	-74.57290315932143	198759

We investigated the time course of their activations during the generation of pro- and anti-saccades from direct intracranial EEG recordings of three human epileptic patients. We found the preparation and the production of the saccades to be coincident with focal and transient increases of EEG power above 60 Hz. Those were produced in very specific brain sites distributed in the FEF and the SEF (as identified by previous human studies at a coarser time resolution). Furthermore, the spatio-temporal resolution of those recordings turned out to be sufficient to discriminate anatomically between several types of neural responses, determined either by the visual or by the motor components of the saccade tasks, and within this second category of responses, between some associated with the preparation of the saccades and others associated with their execution. Altogether, this study provides the first evidence of high-frequency neural responses in the generation of saccades in humans, and provides a firm basis for other studies detailing further the functional organization of the human oculomotor system at this level of spatial and temporal resolution.	electric stimulation technique;electrocorticography;electroencephalography;epilepsy;eye movements;focal (programming language);functional electrical stimulation;functional imaging;hertz (hz);intracranial aneurysm;movement;patients;saccades;spectral edge frequency;frontal lobe	Jean-Philippe Lachaux;Dominique Hoffmann;Lorella Minotti;Alain Berthoz;Philippe Kahane	2006	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.11.023	psychology;computer vision;neuroscience;radiology;temporal resolution;functional imaging;high frequency;communication;supplementary eye field	ML	18.276929732849048	-78.8196718510456	199047
30c9e95b98c1d6b72ebc8bf0472b3b78056a5d08	end-to-end linkage (eel) clustering algorithm: a study on the distribution of meissner corpuscles in the skin	hierarchical clustering;cluster algorithm;internal structure;cluster analysis;grouped data	A novel hierarchical clustering algorithm was applied to the distribution of Meissner corpuscles in the skin of mammals. This method, called end-to-end linkage (EEL), is useful for grouping data that consists of chain-like contingencies in the multivariable space. Unlike the traditional techniques which uncover hyperspherical clusters (e.g. single linkage), EEL considers the shortest distance between the predefined end pairs of the two clusters as an inter-group distance. This scheme allows characterizing the internal structure of data better than other hierarchical techniques. The anatomical data used in the case study is important for studying the sense of touch. The results show a substantial improvement over the traditional single-linkage method. On average, the number of correctly classified corpuscles is increased to twice the number identified by the single-linkage method. EEL can also be used for analyzing other sensory modalities where geometric relationships need to be explored. In addition, the report contains corpuscle density and epidermal-ridge width data obtained from several species.	classification;corpuscle;eel;end-to-end principle;epidermis;hierarchical clustering;linkage (software);mammals;short;single linkage cluster analysis;single-linkage clustering;skin (computing);algorithm;genetic linkage;statistical cluster;width	Burak Güçlü;Stanley J.

The diffusion MRI data that tractography is based on requires a high angular resolution to resolve crossing fibers whereas high spatial resolution is required to distinguish kissing from crossing fibers. However, scan time increases with increasing spatial and angular resolutions, which can become infeasible in clinical settings. Here we investigated the trade-off between spatial and angular resolutions to determine which of these factors is most worth investing scan time in. We created a unique diffusion MRI dataset with 1.0 mm isotropic resolution and a high angular resolution (100 directions) using an advanced 3D diffusion-weighted multi-slab EPI acquisition. This dataset was reconstructed to create subsets of lower angular (75, 50, and 25 directions) and lower spatial (1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mm) resolution. Using all subsets, we investigated the effects of angular and spatial resolutions in three fiber bundles-the corticospinal tract, arcuate fasciculus and corpus callosum-by analyzing the volumetric bundle overlap and anatomical correspondence between tracts. Our results indicate that the subsets of 25 and 50 directions provided inferior tract reconstructions compared with the datasets with 75 and 100 directions. Datasets with spatial resolutions of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm were comparable, while the lowest resolution (2.5 mm) datasets had discernible inferior quality. In conclusion, we found that angular resolution appeared to be more influential than spatial resolution in improving tractography results. Spatial resolutions higher than 2.0 mm only appear to benefit multi-fiber tractography methods if this is not at the cost of decreased angular resolution.	angularjs;body of uterus;corpus callosum;fascicle - nerve fibers;numerous;silo (dataset);slab allocation;tissue fiber;tract (literature);video-in video-out;white matter	Sjoerd B.

This information flow is captured in its simplest form via the concepts of synchronization and desynchronization and related metrics. More complex forms of information flow are transient synchronizations and multi-frequency behaviors with metrics related to cross-frequency coupling (CFC). It is supposed that CFC plays a crucial role in the organization of large-scale networks and functional integration across large distances. In this study, we describe different CFC measures and test their applicability in simulated and real electroencephalographic (EEG) data obtained during resting state. For these purposes, we derive generic oscillator equations from full brain network models. We systematically model and simulate the various scenarios of CFC under the influence of noise to obtain biologically realistic oscillator dynamics. We find that (i) specific CFC-measures detect correctly in most cases the nature of CFC under noise conditions, (ii) bispectrum (BIS) and bicoherence (BIC) correctly detect the CFCs in simulated data, (iii) empirical resting state EEG show a prominent delta-alpha CFC as identified by specific CFC measures and the more classic BIS and BIC. This coupling was mostly asymmetric (directed) and generally higher in the eyes closed (EC) than in the eyes open (EO) condition. In conjunction, these two sets of measures provide a powerful toolbox to reveal the nature of couplings from experimental data and as such allow inference on the brain state dependent information processing. Methodological advantages of using CFC measures and theoretical significance of delta and alpha interactions during resting and other brain states are discussed.	ablepharon;bag3 wt allele;bayesian information criterion;behavior;bispectrum;chlorofluorocarbons;convergence (action);directed graph;electroencephalography;eye;functional integration;generic drugs;hearing loss, high-frequency;inference;information processing;interaction;mir155 gene;numerous;oscillator device component;rest;resting state fmri;simulation;synchronization (computer science);imidazole mustard;type i interferon receptor	Viktor K.

6c6f443d00037a39bb3a3109387a0d42ad255fa4	task complexity relates to activation of cortical motor areas during uni- and bimanual performance: a functional nirs study	unimanual;bilateral;right hemisphere;left handed;functional near infrared spectroscopy;right handed;ipsilateral;hand motor tasks;near infrared spectroscopy;contralateral;primary motor cortex;bimanual;inhibition;task complexity;motor function	Hand motor tasks are frequently used to assess impaired motor function in neurology and neurorehabilitation. Assessments can be varied by means of hand laterality, i.e. unimanual or bimanual performance, as well as by means of task complexity, i.e. different degrees ranging from simple to complex sequence tasks. The resulting functional activation in human primary motor cortex (M1) has been studied intensively by traditional neuroimaging methods. Previous studies using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) investigated simple hand motor tasks. However, it is unknown whether fNIRS can also detect changes in response to increasing task complexity. Our hypothesis was to show that fNIRS could detect activation changes in relation to task complexity in uni- and bimanual tasks. Sixteen healthy right-handed subjects performed five finger-tapping tasks: unimanual left and right, simple and complex tasks as well as bimanual complex tasks. We found significant differences in oxy-hemoglobin (O(2)Hb) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HHb) concentration in the right hemisphere over M1. Largest O(2)Hb concentration changes were found during complex (0.351+/-0.051 micromol/l) and simple (0.275+/-0.054 micromol/l) right hand tasks followed by bimanual (0.249+/-0.047 micromol/l), complex (0.154+/-0.034 micromol/l) and simple (0.110+/-0.034 micromol/l) left hand tasks. Largest HHb concentration changes were found during bimanual (-0.138+/-0.006 micromol/l) tasks, followed by simple right hand (-0.12+/-0.016 micromol/l), complex left (-0.0875+/-0.007 micromol/l), complex right (-0.0863+/-0.005 micromol/l) and simple left (-0.0674+/-0.005 micromol/l) hand tasks. We report for the first time that fNIRS detects oxygenation changes in relation to task complexity during finger-tapping. The study aims to contribute to the establishment of fNIRS as a neuroimaging method to assess hand motor function in clinical settings where traditional neuroimaging methods cannot be applied.	cell respiration;cerebral cortex;deoxyhemoglobin;evaluation procedure;handedness;julia;largest;micromole;motor cortex;neuroimaging;neurological rehabilitation;neurology speciality;patients;population;spatial variability;spectroscopy, near-infrared;switzerland;tropicoperdix merlini;hemoglobin d punjab	Lisa Holper;Martin Biallas;Martin Wolf	2009	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.03.027	psychology;cognitive psychology;near-infrared spectroscopy;neuroscience;developmental psychology;motor skill;functional near-infrared spectroscopy;communication	HCI	17.67073561147738	-79.65584429385757	199590

In this paper, we aim at further examining whether syndromes of schizophrenia could be decoded by some special spatiotemporal patterns of resting-state functional connectivity. We designed a data-driven classifier based on machine learning to extract highly discriminative functional connectivity features and to discriminate schizophrenic patients from healthy controls. The proposed classifier consisted of two separate steps. First, we used feature selection based on a correlation coefficient method to extract highly discriminative regions and construct the optimal feature set for classification. Then, an unsupervised-learning classifier combining low-dimensional embedding and self-organized clustering of fMRI was trained to discriminate schizophrenic patients from healthy controls. The performance of the classifier was tested using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. The experimental results demonstrated not only high classification accuracy (93.75% for schizophrenic patients, 75.0% for healthy controls), but also good generalization and stability with respect to the number of extracted features. In addition, some functional connectivities between certain brain regions of the cerebellum and frontal cortex were found to exhibit the highest discriminative power, which might provide further evidence for the cognitive dysmetria hypothesis of schizophrenia. This primary study demonstrated that machine learning could extract exciting new information from the resting-state activity of a brain with schizophrenia, which might have potential ability to improve current diagnosis and treatment evaluation of schizophrenia.	cerebellum;cerebral cortex;classification;cluster analysis;coefficient;cognition disorders;cortical cell layer of the cerebellum;cross reactions;cross-validation (statistics);embedding;extraction;feature selection;generalization (psychology);interphase cell;machine learning;mental disorders;patients;rest;resting state fmri;schizophrenia;self-organization;spatiotemporal pattern;syndrome;unsupervised learning;algorithm;manifold;statistical cluster	Hui Shen;Lubin Wang;Yadong Liu;Dewen Hu	2010	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.11.011	psychology;unsupervised learning;machine learning;pattern recognition;schizophrenia;communication;feature selection	ML	23.253066198950595	-78.26714022883293	199723

The hypothesisdriven General Linear Model (GLM) and the data-driven Independent Component Analysis (ICA) model are the two most commonly used models for fMRI data analysis. A hybrid ICA-GLM model combines the two models to take advantages of benefits from both models to achieve more accurate mapping of the stimulus-induced activated brain regions. We propose a modified hybrid ICA-GLM model with probabilistic ICA that includes a noise model. In this modified hybrid model, a probabilistic principle component analysis (PPCA)-based component number estimation is used in the ICA stage to extract the intrinsic number of original time courses. In addition, frequency matching is introduced into the time course selection stage, along with temporal correlation, F-test based model fitting estimation, and time course combination, to produce a more accurate design matrix for GLM. A standard fMRI dataset is used to compare the results of applying GLM and the proposed hybrid ICA-GLM in generating activation maps.© (2011) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
