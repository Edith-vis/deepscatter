90ea1aa43110136b85501e0dcb0cfe32de142a25	the placement optimization program: a practical solution to the disk file assignment problem	assignment problem;queueing network model;heuristic optimization;validation studies	In this paper we describe a practical mathematical formulation and solution of the so-called “File Assignment Problem” (FAP) for computer disks. Our FAP solution has been implemented in a PL/I program known as the Placement Optimization Program (POP). The algorithm consists of three major components — two heuristic optimization models and a queueing network model. POP has been used in validation studies to assign files to disks in two IBM MVS complexes. The resulting savings in I/O response times were 22% and 25%, respectively. Throughout the paper we shall emphasize the real-world nature of our approach to the disk FAP, which we believe sets it apart from previous attempts.	algorithm;assignment problem;face animation parameter;heuristic;ibm research;mathematical optimization;network model;norm (social);pl/i;queueing theory	Joel L.

Extensions to the context of a column generation solution approach are not straightforward. The Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle can indeed be exploited in greedy, local search, rounding or truncated exact methods. The price coordination mechanism can bring a global view that may be lacking in some “myopic” approaches based on a compact formulation. However, the dynamic generation of variables requires specific adaptation of heuristic paradigms. The column generation literature reports many application specific studies where primal heuristics are a key to success. There remains to extract generic methods that could be seen as black-box primal heuristics for use across applications. In this paper we review generic classes of column generation based primal heuristics. We then focus on a so-called “diving” method in which we introduce diversification based on Limited Discrepancy Search. While being a general purpose approach, the implementation of our heuristic illustrates the technicalities specific to column generation. The method is numerically tested on variants of the cutting stock and vehicle routing problems.	black box;column generation;dantzig–wolfe decomposition;discrepancy function;diversification (finance);greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;linear programming;local search (optimization);numerical analysis;rounding;solver;vehicle routing problem	Cédric Joncour;S.

Cost functions are convex latency functions plus a fixed activation cost. A branch and bound algorithm is devised, featuring three important characteristics. First, the lower bound (therefore each subproblem) can be computed in O(n log n). Second, to break symmetries resulting in improved efficiency, the branching scheme is n-ary (instead of the """" classical """" binary). Third, a very affective heuristic is used to compute a good upper bound at the root node of the enumeration tree. All three features lead to a successful comparison against CPLEX MIPQ, which is the fastest among several commercial and open-source solvers: computational results showing this fact are provided."""	branch and bound;cplex;computation;convex function;exact algorithm;experiment;fastest;heuristic;incisive;linear programming relaxation;open-source software;tree (data structure)	Alessandro Agnetis;Enrico Grande;Andrea Pacifici	2012	Math.

184e6090531c0e3565ea54db5efff73078706f6a	on a new class of nonlinear set covering problems arising in wireless network design	wireless local area network;wireless network;set covering problem;set cover;branch and price	This is a summary of the author’s PhD thesis, supervised by Edoardo Amaldi and defended on 28 April 2006 at Politecnico di Milano, Dipartimento di Matematica. The thesis is written in English and is available from the author upon request. The thesis investigates a class of nonlinear set covering variants arising from the problem of designing single-frequency Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) with maximum efficiency. In the first part of the thesis a basic hyperbolic formulation of the problem is considered. After a complexity and approximability study, the problem is tackled by linearization techniques, and by Lagrangean and Dantzig–Wolfe decompositions. The second part of the thesis focuses on variants accounting for various relevant features of the WLAN application. A Branch-and-Price algorithm is presented, and extensions to the multiple-frequency WLAN design problem are considered.	covering problems;network planning and design;nonlinear system	Sandro Bosio	2008	4OR	10.1007/s10288-007-0052-6	mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;set cover problem;algorithm	Theory	23.047966326602413	10.16767273694342	178918

Computational experiments compare the algorithm with the well-known GPS algorithm, as well as recently proposed methods. These show the new approach to be as good as current best algorithms. In addition, an algorithm to randomly generate matrices with known optimal bandwidth is developed and used to evaluate results. Comparisons show that the new algorithm was able to find either the optimal solution or a solution very close to the optimal for most instances. # 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In alternative to local consistency, which is usually maintained in handling continuous constraints, we discuss maintaining global hull-consistency. Experimental results show that this may be an appropriate choice, achieving acceptable precision with relatively low computational cost. The approach relies on efficient algorithms and the best results are obtained with the integration of a local search procedure within interval constraint propagation.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;constraint satisfaction problem;feasible region;interval arithmetic;local consistency;local search (constraint satisfaction);local search (optimization);performance;software propagation	Jorge Cruz;Pedro Barahona	2001		10.1007/3-540-45329-6_34	constraint logic programming;mathematical optimization;constraint programming;discrete mathematics;decision support system;constraint satisfaction;constraint learning;computer science;artificial intelligence;local search;mathematics;interval arithmetic;constraint satisfaction problem;algorithm;hybrid algorithm;local consistency	AI	21.641782831206957	6.0338863990537455	180304

There exists a number of applications of the TDTSP in the fields of distribution and scheduling. We present a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for the TDTSP. A directed multi-partite graph representation of this model facilitates the development of a local search heuristic which extends the well known Lin-Kernighan tour improvement heuristic to the TDTSP. A second upper bound is derived by applying a Benders-decomposition-based heuristic to the MILP formulation. The Benders master problem is further approximately solved to provide a lower bound. We also develop a method for generating TDTSP instances with known optimal solutions. Finally, computational experience with the heuristics and problem generator is presented for problems with up to 100 cities. The results demonstrate that the heuristics can achieve optimal or very good near-optimal solutions on a variety of problem classes with minimal computational effort.	heuristic;travelling salesman problem	Russ J.

Authorities want to determine where to locate the facilities of a social infrastructure network and what should be the capacity of these facilities. Each user must be assigned to its closest facility and, to be economically viable, each facility must serve at least a pre-specified level of demand. The objective is to maximize the accessibility to facilities (i.e., to minimize the distance traveled by users to reach the facilities). A location model that captures the above features is formulated and different solution methods are tested. Among the methods tested, tabu search and a specialized local search heuristic provided the best solutions. The application of the model is illustrated through a case study involving the location of preschools in the municipality of Miranda do Corvo, Portugal.	accessibility;closing (morphology);diversification (finance);heuristic (computer science);local search (optimization);miranda;randomness;social infrastructure;social network;software release life cycle;tabu search	João F.

Our results suggest the need for simple heuristics to solve the problem. We identify cases in which the heuristics perform optimally, and we analyze the worst case behavior of the heuristics. We develop an optimal branch-and-bound procedure that is computationally efficient for medium-sized problems. We also present a decomposition principle helpful for dealing with large workflow matrices. We report computational results on the heuristics and the branch-and-bound procedure. We show that one of the heuristics performs impressively well in terms of solution quality and computational time requirements.	automation	Panagiotis Kouvelis;Michael W.

Our analysis shows, however, that for certain types of instances Push and Swap may fail to find a solution. We present the Push and Rotate algorithm, an adaptation of the Push and Swap algorithm, and prove that by fixing the latter’s shortcomings, we obtain an algorithm that is complete for the class of instances with two unoccupied locations in a connected graph. In addition, we provide experimental results that show our algorithm to perform competitively on a set of benchmark problems from the video game industry.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);connectivity (graph theory);motion planning;multi-agent system;paging;push technology	Boris de Wilde;Adriaan ter Mors;Cees Witteveen	2013			planning;mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;distributed computing	AI	22.283283796526945	5.035032362855795	185121

In the worst-case scenario the best complexity result to date guarantees that such a point is obtained in at most O( √ n| ln |) steps of an interior-point method. We show that the expected value of the number of steps required to obtain an -optimal solution for a probabilistic linear programming model is at most O(min{n1.5, m√n ln(n)}) + log2(| ln |). © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The problem consists of finding a spanning tree that minimizes so-called robust deviation, i.e. deviation from an optimal solution under the worst case realization of interval weights. As it was proven in Kouvelis and Yu (Robust Discrete Optimization and Its Applications, Kluwer Academic, Norwell, 1997), the problem is NP-hard, therefore it is of great interest to tackle it with some metaheuristic approach, namely simulated annealing, in order to calculate an approximate solution for large scale instances efficiently. We describe theoretical aspects and present the results of computational experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop a metaheuristic approach for solving the robust spanning tree problem.	algorithm;file spanning;minimum spanning tree;simulated annealing	Yury Nikulin	2008	J.

e31bba8ba77f9f9a00069e546c4441821a76e7d9	cip and miqp models for the load balancing nurse-to-patient assignment problem		The load balancing nurse-to-patient assignment problem requires the assignment of nurses to patients to minimize the variance of the nurses’ workload. This challenging benchmark is currently best solved exactly with constraint programming (CP) using the spread constraint and a problem-specific heuristic. We show that while the problem is naturally modelled as a mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem, the MIQP does not match the performance of CP. We then develop several constraint integer programming (CIP) models that include bounds propagation, linear relaxations, and cutting planes associated with the quadratic, gcc, and spread global constraints. While the quadratic and gcc techniques are known, our additions to the spread constraint are novel. Our empirical results demonstrate that the CIP approach substantially out-performs the MIQP model, but still lags behind CP. Finally, we propose a simple problem-specific variable ordering heuristic which greatly improves the CIP models, achieving performance about an order of magnitude faster than CP and establishing a new state of the art.	assignment problem;benchmark (computing);constraint programming;cutting-plane method;gnu compiler collection;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming relaxation;load balancing (computing);local consistency;quadratic programming;software propagation;unit propagation	Wen-Yang Ku;Thiago Pinheiro;J.

First, we describe a generator of random CSPs that allows us to control the level of interchangeability in an instance. Then we study how the varying level of interchangeability affects the performance of search for finding one solution and all solutions to the CSP. We conduct experiments using forward-checking search, extended with static and dynamic ordering heuristics in combination with non-bundling, static, and dynamic bundling strategies. We demonstrate that: (1) While the performance of bundling decreases in general with decreasing interchangeability, this effect is muted when finding a first solution. (2) Dynamic ordering strategies are significantly more resistant to this degradation than static ordering. (3) Dynamic bundling strategies perform overall significantly better than static bundling strategies. Even when finding one solution, the size of the bundles yielded by dynamic bundling is large and less sensitive to the level of interchangeability. (4) The combination of dynamic ordering heuristics with dynamic bundling is advantageous. We conclude that this combination, in addition to yielding the best results, is the least sensitive to the level of interchangeability, and thus, indeed is superior to other searches.	communicating sequential processes;constraint logic programming;constraint satisfaction problem;dld (software);elegant degradation;embedded system;experiment;heuristic (computer science);local consistency;look-ahead (backtracking);network interface controller;product bundling;tf–idf	Amy M.

Currently we are also witnessing a proliferation of optimization/operations research related software which can solve reasonable size nonlinear programs (e.g. Eureka: The Solver), linear and integer programming problems (e.g. LINDO), etc. on the IBM-PC microcomputer. Despite the availability of these packages, there seems to be a lack of software for solving dynamic optimization problems, i.e. dynamic programming (DP) and optimal control. The purpose of this paper is to show how easily the Lotus 1-2-3 electronic spreadsheet program can be used to solve discrete state and discrete stage dynamic programs, and discrete time linear quadratic tracking control problems on an IBM-PC.	dynamic programming;mathematical optimization;personal computer;spreadsheet	Mahmut Parlar	1989	Automatica	10.1016/0005-1098(89)90123-4	simulation;optimal control;computer science;engineering;theoretical computer science;dynamic programming;mathematics;ibm pc compatible	DB	17.339172130243163	5.981326890397612	186259

5cd3ad2d61bc4530e32c2c44d1fc35efbb456839	job sequencing bounds from decision diagrams		In recent research, decision diagrams have proved useful for the solution of discrete optimization problems. Their success relies on the use of relaxed decision diagrams to obtain bounds on the optimal value, either through a node merger or a node splitting mechanism. We investigate the potential of node merger to provide bounds for dynamic programming models that do not otherwise have a practical relaxation, in particular the job sequencing problem with time windows and statedependent processing times. We prove general conditions under which a node merger operation yields a valid relaxation and apply them to job sequencing. Computational experiments show that, surprisingly, relaxed diagrams prove the optimal value when their size is only a small fraction of the size of an exact diagram. On the other hand, a relaxed diagram of fixed size ceases to provide a useful bound as the instances scale up.	computation;decision problem;diagram;discrete optimization;dynamic programming;experiment;heuristic;integer programming;job shop scheduling;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;microsoft windows;optimization problem;programming model;relaxation (approximation);relaxation (iterative method)	J.

This paper proposes a new approach for the NP-complete edge-biconnectivity augmentation (E2AUG) problem, in which a given graph G0(V, E0) needs to be augmented by the cheapest possible set of edges AUG so that a single edge deletion does not disconnect G0. The new approach is based on a preliminary reduction of the problem and a genetic algorithm (GA) using a binary vector to represent a set of augmenting edges and therefore a candidate solution. Two strategies are proposed to deal with infeasible solutions that do not lead to edge-biconnectivity. In the first, more traditional variant, infeasible solutions are detected and simply discarded. The second method is a hybrid approach that uses an effective heuristic to repair infeasible solutions by adding usually cheap edges to AUG until the graph augmented with AUG becomes edge-biconnected. The two GA-variants are empirically compared to each other and to another iterative heuristic for the E2AUG problem using instances involving up to 1270 edges.	biconnected graph;bit array;edge dominating set;genetic algorithm;hercules graphics card;heuristic;iterative method;k-edge-connected graph;k-vertex-connected graph;np-completeness;samir khuller;software release life cycle;telecommunications network	Ivana Ljubic;Günther R.

Soft time windows constraints are very common in the distribution industry, but quantifying the trade-off between routing cost and customer inconvenience is a hard task for practitioners. In our model, practitioners impose a minimum routing cost saving (to be achieved with respect to the hard time windows solutions) and ask for the minimization of the customer inconvenience only. We propose two exact algorithms. The first algorithm is based on standard branch-and-cut-and-price. The second algorithm uses concepts of bi-objective optimization and is based on the bisection method.	microsoft windows;vehicle routing problem	Matteo Salani;Maria Battarra;Luca Maria Gambardella	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-28697-6_67	route;mathematical optimization;static routing;simulation;computer science;mathematics;operations research	Theory	20.04787098141854	4.7180805254793965	188538
3e26ae44d46bf62c1a75fe1d96956a4e2d70531a	residual-guided look-ahead in and/or search for graphical models		We introduce the concept of local bucket error for the mini-bucket heuristics and show how it can be used to improve the power of AND/OR search for combinatorial optimization tasks in graphical models (e.g. MAP/MPE or weighted CSPs). The local bucket error illuminates how the heuristic errors are distributed in the search space, guided by the minibucket heuristic. We present and analyze methods for compiling the local bucket-errors (exactly and approximately) and show that they can be used to yield an effective tool for balancing look-ahead overhead during search. This can be especially instrumental when memory is restricted, accommodating the generation of only weak compiled heuristics. We illustrate the impact of the proposed schemes in an extensive empirical evaluation for both finding exact solutions and anytime suboptimal solutions.	anytime algorithm;combinatorial optimization;compiler;graphical model;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;overhead (computing)	William Lam;Kalev Kask;Javier Larrosa;Rina Dechter	2017	J.

Several diierent contract types have been introduced to be used for task reallocation: original, cluster, swap, and multiagent contracts. Instead of only using one of these contract types, they can be interleaved in a sequence of contract types. This is a powerful way of constructing algorithms that nd the best solution reachable in a bounded amount of time. The experiments in this paper study how to best sequence the diierent contract types. We show that the number of contracts performed using any one contract type does not necessarily decrease over time as one might expect. The reason is that contracts often play the role of enabling further contracts. The results also show that it is clearly prootable for the agents to mix contract types in the sequence. Sequences of diierent contract types reach a solution signiicantly closer to the global optimum and in a shorter amount of time than sequences with only one contract type. However , the best sequences consist only of two interleaved contract types: original and cluster contracts. This allows us to provide a clear prescription about protocols for anytime task reallocation.	agent-based model;anytime algorithm;experiment;global optimization;multi-agent system;paging	Martin Andersson;Tuomas Sandholm	1998		10.1007/3-540-48835-9_4	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;travelling salesman problem;operations research;algorithm	AI	18.46966911506407	8.67312313107166	189450
805bc5a6e6f6cc9f6a53d4aca91d240919928936	planar maximum coverage location problem with partial coverage and rectangular demand and service zones	planar maximum covering location problem;partial coverage;rectilinear distance;np hard;planar p center problem;branch and bound;rectangle positioning;facility location	We study the planar maximum coverage location problem (MCLP) with rectilinear distance and rectangular demand zones in the case where “partial coverage” is allowed in its true sense, i.e., when covering only part of a demand zone is allowed and the coverage accrued as a result of this is proportional to the demand of the covered part only. We pose the problem in a slightly more general form by allowing services zones to be rectangular instead of squares, thereby addressing applications in camera view-frame selection as well. More specifically, our problem, referred to as PMCLP-PCR, is to position a given number of rectangular service zones (SZs) on the two-dimensional plane to (partially) cover a set of existing (possibly overlapping) rectangular demand zones (DZs) such that the total covered demand is maximized. Previous studies on (planar) MCLP have assumed binary coverage, even when non-point objects such as lines or polygons have been used to represent demand. Under the binary coverage assumption, the problem can be readily formulated and solved as a binary linear program; whereas, partial coverage, although much more realistic, cannot be efficiently handled by binary linear programming making PMCLP-PCR much more challenging to solve. In this paper, we first prove that PMCLP-PCR is NP-hard if the number of SZs is part of the input. We then present an improved algorithm for the single-SZ PMCLPPCR, which is at least two times faster than the existing exact Plateau Vertex Traversal algorithm. Next, we study multi-SZ PMCLP-PCR for the first time and prove theoretical properties which significantly reduce the search space for solving this problem and present a customized branchand-bound exact algorithm to solve it. Our computational experiments show that this algorithm can solve relatively large instances of multi-SZ PMCLP-PCR in a short time. We also propose a fast polynomial time heuristic algorithm. Having optimal solutions from our exact algorithm, we benchmark the quality of solutions obtained from our heuristic algorithm. Our results show that for all the random instances solved to optimality by our exact algorithm, our heuristic algorithm finds a solution in a fraction of a second, where its objective value is at least 91% of the optimal objective in 90% of the instances (and at least 69% of the optimal objective in all the instances).	benchmark (computing);branch and bound;computation;effective method;exact algorithm;experiment;feasible region;heuristic (computer science);in silico pcr;linear programming;max;np-hardness;planar (computer graphics);taxicab geometry;time complexity;tree traversal	Manish Bansal;Kiavash Kianfar	2017	INFORMS Journal on Computing	10.1287/ijoc.2016.0722	mathematical optimization;computer science;facility location problem;np-hard;mathematics;branch and bound	AI	24.377501600222274	7.1560712589331885	189517

By applying the ‘pegging test’ the ordinary knapsack problem can be reduced, often significantly, in size; but this is not directly applicable to our problem. We introduce a kind of surrogate relaxation to derive upper and lower bounds quickly, and show that, with this preprocessing, the similar pegging test can be applied to our problem. The reduced problem can be solved to optimality by the branch-and-bound algorithm. Here, we make use of the surrogate variables to evaluate the upper bound at each branch-and-bound node very quickly by solving a continuous knapsack problem. Through numerical experiments we show that the developed method finds upper and lower bounds of very high accuracy in a few seconds, and solves larger instances to optimality faster than the previously published algorithms. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We focus on literature published during the last decade. Because routing and scheduling problems are closely related to many other fleet planning problems, we have divided this review into several parts. We start at the strategic fleet planning level and discuss the design of fleets and sea transport systems. We continue with the tactical and operational fleet planning level and consider problems that comprise various ship routing and scheduling aspects. Here, we separately discuss the different modes of operations: industrial, tramp, and liner shipping. Finally, we take a glimpse at naval applications and other related problems that do not naturally fall into these categories. The paper also presents some perspectives regarding future developments and use of optimization-based decision-support systems for ship routing and scheduling. Several of the trends indicate both accelerating needs for and benefits from such systems and, hopefully, this paper will stimulate further research in this area.	routing	Marielle Christiansen;Kjetil Fagerholt;David Ronen	2004	Transportation Science	10.1287/trsc.1030.0036	supply;planning;routing;perspective;strategic planning;trend analysis;computer science;engineering;operations management;comparative research;modal analysis;mathematics;transport engineering;operations research;scheduling	Theory	17.5465068958967	5.2165071962852325	191951
328d273108e04f3f9cb1b0d0a5111657b060b674	a general framework for reordering agents asynchronously in distributed csp		Reordering agents during search is an essential component of the efficiency of solving a distributed constraint satisfaction problem. Termination values have been recently proposed as a way to simulate the min-domain dynamic variable ordering heuristic. The use of termination values allows the greatest flexibility in reordering agents dynamically while keeping polynomial space. In this paper, we propose a general framework based on termination values for reordering agents asynchronously. The termination values are generalized to represent various heuristics other than min-domain. Our general framework is sound, complete, terminates and has a polynomial space complexity. We implemented several variable ordering heuristics that are well-known in centralized CSPs but could not until now be applied to the distributed setting. Our empirical study shows the significance of our framework compared to state-of-the-art asynchronous dynamic ordering algorithms for solving distributed CSP.	algorithm;centralized computing;complete (complexity);constraint satisfaction problem;cryptographic service provider;dspace;distributed constraint optimization;heuristic (computer science);maxima and minima;pspace;polynomial;simulation;termination analysis	Mohamed Wahbi;Younes Mechqrane;Christian Bessiere;Kenneth N.

We show that the algorithm proposed in Punnen and Aneja (Oper Res Lett 32:27–30, 2004 ) can be modified to ensure that the resulting solution is indeed optimal. This modification is attained at the expense of increased worst-case complexity, but still maintains polynomial solvability of various special cases that are of general interest. In particular, we show that GBaOP can be solved in polynomial time if an associated bottleneck problem can be solved in polynomial time. For the solution of this bottleneck problem, we propose two alternative approaches. Copyright Springer-Verlag 2011	mathematical optimization	Lara Turner;Abraham P. Punnen;Yash P. Aneja;Horst W.

If link dependent, such restrictions in general have the effect that the minimum time path for a “convoy” of items to travel from a given origin to a given destination will depend on the size of the convoy. The Quickest Path problem seeks a path to minimise this convoy travel time. A closely related bicriterion problem is the Maximum Capacity Shortest Path problem. For this latter problem, an effective implementation is devised for an algorithm to determine desired sets of efficient solutions which in turn facilitates the search for a “best” compromise solution. Numerical experience with the algorithm is reported.	algorithm;data structure;entity–relationship model;maximal set;numerical analysis;regular expression;shortest path problem	Brian Boffey;R. C.

Because of their complexity, recent research has turned to genetic algorithms to address such problems. Although genetic algorithms have been proven to facilitate the entire space search, but they lack in fine-tuning capability for obtaining the global optimum. Therefore, in this study a multiprogramming genetic algorithm (MGA) was developed for permutation optimization. Both the global exploration (through crossover operation and mutation operation) among the population and the local exploitation (through selection operation) around chromosomes are integrated to MGA. In order to improve the performance of MGA, the authors establish some regulations (replacement regulation, local optimization regulation and global optimization regulation) to help the evolvement of MGA. Computational experiments are conducted on most of ATSP instances available in the TSPLIB, and on a set of larger asymmetric instances with known optimal solutions. The comparisons show that the results obtained by our method compare favorably with those obtained by several other algorithms recently proposed for the ATSP. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Positioning systems using satellites can help reduce the cost of installing and maintaining trackside equipment. This paper develops a nonlinear combinatorial data reduction model for a large amount of railway Global Positioning System (GPS) data to decrease the memory space and, thus, speed up train positioning. Three algorithms are proposed by employing the concept of looking ahead, using the dichotomy idea, or adopting the breadth-first strategy after changing the problem into a shortest path problem to obtain an optimal solution. Two techniques are developed to substantially cut down the computing time for the optimal algorithm. The surveyed GPS data of the Qinghai-Tibet railway (QTR) are used to compare the performance of the algorithms. Results show that the algorithms can extract a few data points from the large amount of GPS data points, thus enabling a simpler representation of the train tracks. Furthermore, these proposed algorithms show a tradeoff between the solution quality and computation time of the algorithms.	a history of tibet by the fifth dalai lama of tibet;algorithm;breadth-first search;computation;dspace;data point;global positioning system;nonlinear system;shortest path problem;time complexity	Dewang Chen;Yun-Shan Fu;Baigen Cai;Ya-Xiang Yuan	2010	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2010.2048030	simulation;computer science;shortest path problem;algorithm;statistics	Robotics	21.06533202449268	7.698494247426479	195261

As usual, each item is associated with its profit and weight, and the problem is to determine the subset of items to be packed into the knapsack. However, in the problem there are s players and the items are divided into s + 1 disjoint groups, Nk (k = 0,1, . . . , s). The player k is concerned only with the items in N0 [ Nk, where N0 is the set of common items, while Nk represents the set of his own items. The problem is to maximize the minimum of the profits of all the players. An algorithm is developed to solve this problem to optimality, and through a series of computational experiments, we evaluate the performance of the developed algorithm. 2004 Elsevier B.V.

bc5dbb190fef75693a49e4954bbd44fadc488fe4	a complete multi-robot path-planning algorithm	multi-robot;path planning;algorithms	In the domain of multi-robot path-planning problems, robots must move from their start locations to their goal locations while avoiding collisions with each other. The research problem that we addressed is to find a complete solution for the multi-robot path-planning problem. Our first contribution is to recognize the solvable instances of the problem with our solvability test; the theoretical analysis has already been provided to show the validity of this test. Our second contribution is to solve this problem completely, in polynomial time, with the Push and Spin (PASp) algorithm. Once the problem was solved, we found decisions within the complete solution that may improve the performance of the complete algorithm. Hence, our third contribution is to improve the performance by selecting the best path from the set of complete paths. We refer to the improved version of our algorithm as the improved PASp algorithm. In terms of the completeness evaluation, the mathematical proofs demonstrate that the PASp is a complete algorithm for a wider class of problem instances than the classes solved by the Push and Swap (PAS), Push and Rotate (PAR), Bibox or the tractable multi-robot path-planning (MAPP) algorithms. Moreover, PASp solves any graph recognized to be solvable without any assumptions. In addition, the theoretical proof of the PASp algorithm showed completive polynomial performance in terms of total-path-lengths and execution time. In our performance evaluation, the experimental results showed that the PASp performs competitively, in reasonable execution time, in terms of number of moves compared to the PAS, PAR, Bibox and MAPP algorithms on a set of benchmark problems from the video-game industry. In addition, the results showed the scalability and robustness of PASp in problems that can be solved only by PASp. Such problems require high levels of coordination with an efficient number of moves and short execution time. In grid and bi-connected graphs with too many cycles, PASp required more moves and more time than the PAS, PAR and Bibox algorithms. However, PASp is the only algorithm capable of solving such instances with only one unoccupied vertex. Furthermore, adding heuristic search and smooth operation to the improved PASp showed significant further improvement by reducing the number of moves for all problem instances. PASp produced the best plans in a bit higher time. Finally, the PASp algorithm solves a wider class of problems and performs more completely in very complex/crowded environments than other state-of-art algorithms. Additionally, the Spin operation introduces a novel swapping technique to exchange two items and restore others in a graph for industrial applications.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;benchmark (computing);cobham's thesis;decision problem;heuristic;motion planning;paging;performance evaluation;polynomial;robot;run time (program lifecycle phase);scalability;time complexity	Ebtehal Turki Saho Alotaibi;Hisham Al-Rawi	2018	Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems	10.1007/s10458-018-9391-2	time complexity;completeness (statistics);robustness (computer science);computer science;motion planning;scalability;spin-½;polynomial;heuristic;algorithm	AI	22.265828041747728	4.893816530738017	196821

An alternative solution approach, called here the control-algorithm approach, is to employ a math program (MP) to approximately represent the MDP and use its optimal solution to heuristically instantiate the parameters of the decision rules of a given class of control policies. As new information is observed over time, the control algorithm can incorporate it by re-solving the MP and revising the parameters of the decision rules with the newly obtained solution. The re-solving issue arises when one reflects on the consequences of this revision: Does the performance of the control algorithm really improve by revising its decision-rule instantiation with the solution of the re-solved MP, or should rather an appropriate modification of the prior solution be used? This paper analyzes the control-algorithm re-solving issue for a class of finite-horizon inventoryand revenue-management problems. It establishes sufficient, but not necessary, conditions under which re-solving does not deteriorate the performance of a control algorithm, and it applies these results to control algorithms for network revenue-management and multiproduct make-to-order production with lost sales and positive leadtime.	aggregate data;algorithm;approximation;combinatorial optimization;control flow;control theory;curse of dimensionality;dynamic programming;heuristic;linear programming;markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;sequential consistency;simulation;universal instantiation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Nicola Secomandi	2008	Manufacturing & Service Operations Management	10.1287/msom.1070.0184	markov decision process;mathematical optimization;build to order;simulation;curse of dimensionality;economics;computer science;marketing;operations management;decision rule;model predictive control	AI	20.174795205373506	4.874081830479693	197141

According to the client relevance, job processing cost, and many other considerations a weight is assigned to each job. An important and non-trivial objective is to minimize weighted tardiness. Evolutionary Algorithms have been successfully applied to solve scheduling problems. MCMP-SRI (Multiple Crossover Multiple Parents - Stud Random Immigrants) is a MCMP variant which considers the inclusion of a stud- breeding individual in a parent's pool of random immigrants. The Selfish Gene Algorithm proposed by Corno et al. is an interpretation of Darwinian theory given by the biologist Richard Dawkins. In this work we are showing a new algorithm that combines the MCMP-SRI and Selfish Gene approaches. This algorithm is used to face the weighted tardiness problem in a single machine environment. The paper summarizes implementation details and discusses its performance for a set of problem instances taken from the OR-Library.	evolutionary algorithm;scheduling (computing)	Andrea Villagra;Maria E.

In a previous paper we proposed a MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) model to apportion the seats in the European Parliament (EP). Since the exact solution to the problem is not computationally efficient, we have designed a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm based on Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and Tabu Search (TS). The proposed approach takes into account the existing situation, guaranteeing a minimum number of seats, independently of the population size of each member. The model is illustrated with actual data and its results are compared with the present apportionment. The results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the proportionality of the present apportionment.	computational complexity theory;expectation propagation;experiment;integer programming;linear programming;metaheuristic;search algorithm;tabu search;variable neighborhood search	Gabriel Villa;Sebastián Lozano;Jesús Racero;David Canca	2006		10.1007/11730095_24	mathematical optimization;mathematics;algorithm;cartography	AI	19.105453657237415	6.069479625516235	197330

The difficulty of the problem compared with its counterpart without set-up times is explained. A lower bound on the value of the objective function is calculated by Lagrangian relaxation with subgradient optimisation. During the process, attempts are made to get good feasible solutions (ie. upper bounds) through a smoothing heuristic, followed by a local search with a variable neighbourhood. Solutions found in this way are further optimised by solving a capacitated transshipment problem. The paper describes the various elements of the solution procedure and presents the results of extensive numerical experimentation.	heuristic	Khalil S.

First, we replace the classical partition of the event set into controllable and uncontrollable events from supervisory control theory, by associating a control and observation cost to each event. This leads naturally to formulate the supervisory control problem as an optimal control problem. Monitor places which enforce the constraint are devised as a solution of an integer linear programming problem whose objective function is expressed in terms of the introduced costs. Second, we consider timed models for which the monitor choice may lead to performance optimization. If the plant net belongs to the class of mono-T-semiflow nets, we present an integer linear fractional programming approach to synthesize the optimal monitor so as to minimize the cycle time lower bound of the closed loop net. For strongly connected marked graphs the cycle time of the closed-loop net can be minimized	consistency model;control theory;fractional programming;integer programming;linear programming;linear-fractional programming;loss function;marked graph;mathematical optimization;mutual exclusion;optimal control;optimization problem;performance tuning;petri net;program optimization;strongly connected component	Francesco Basile;Pasquale Chiacchio;Alessandro Giua	2007	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2006.887905	control engineering;fractional programming;discrete mathematics;integer programming;linear programming;control theory;mathematics;petri net	Robotics	19.498154995048235	8.581728751206116	197784
d5b770c3d4f95461180c630299dc5b7bb570f0f8	on a traveling salesman based bilevel programming problem		In this paper, we consider a linear bilevel programming problem where both the leader and the follower maximize their profits subject to budget constraints. Additionally, we impose a Hamiltonian cycle topology constraint in the leader problem. In particular, models of this type can be motivated by telecommunication companies when dealing with traffic network flows from one server to another one within a ring topology framework. We transform the bilevel programming problem into an equivalent single level optimization problem that we further linearize in order to derive mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations. This is achieved by replacing the follower problem with the equivalent Karush Kuhn Tucker conditions and with a linearization approach to deal with the complementarity constraints. The topology constraint is handled by the means of two compact formulations and an exponential one from the classic traveling salesman problem. Thus, we compute optimal solutions and upper bounds with linear programs. One of the compact models allows to solve instances with up to 250 nodes to optimality. Finally, we propose an iterative procedure that allows to compute optimal solutions in remarkably less computational effort when compared to the compact	algorithm;bilevel optimization;cplex;central processing unit;complementarity theory;computation;hamiltonian path;integer programming;iterative method;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;linear programming;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;ring network;server (computing);stochastic process;time complexity;travelling salesman problem;tucker decomposition	Pablo Adasme;Rafael Andrade;Janny Leung;Abdel Lisser	2017		10.5220/0006190503290336	traveling purchaser problem;2-opt;3-opt;bottleneck traveling salesman problem	AI	23.32894922330587	10.89634987793275	198502

The first one is related to the challenging presence of probabilistic constraints which assure the satisfaction of the stochastic constraints with a given probability, whereas the second one is due to the integer nature of the decision variables. In this paper we present a tailored heuristic approach based on alternating phases of exploration and feasibility repairing which we call Express (Explore and Repair Stochastic Solution) heuristic. The exploration is carried out by the iterative solution of simplified reduced integer problems in which probabilistic constraints are discarded and deterministic additional constraints are adjoined. Feasibility is restored through a penalty approach. Computational results, collected on a probabilistically constrained version of the classical 0---1 multiknapsack problem, show that the proposed heuristic is able to determine good quality solutions in a limited amount of time.	heuristic	Maria Elena Bruni;Patrizia Beraldi;Demetrio Laganà	2013	J.

In the proposed algorithm, based on the job-clustering method, we construct the Global Scheduling Characteristics Prediction Model (GSCPM) to obtain the scheduling characteristics values, including the information of the bottleneck jobs and the predicted value of the global scheduling objective. Then, we adopt the above scheduling characteristics values to guide and coordinate the process of the problem decomposition and the sub-problem solving. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive genetic algorithm to solve each sub-problem. Numerical computational results show that the proposed algorithm is effective for large-scale scheduling problems.	algorithm;iterative method;scheduling (computing)	Min Liu;Jinghua Hao;Cheng Wu	2008	Mathematical and Computer Modelling	10.1016/j.mcm.2007.03.032	fair-share scheduling;nurse scheduling problem;job shop scheduling;open-shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;decomposition method;flow shop scheduling;prediction;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;artificial intelligence;genetic algorithm scheduling;mathematical model;mathematics;predictive modelling;iterative method;least slack time scheduling;lottery scheduling;decomposition;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;multiprocessor scheduling;algorithm;statistics	Vision	17.79689583241652	6.937830384953362	199339
