a3e1bb951b189c2a76c291eafbd6294647a17161	an enhanced radio tomographic imaging with csi-mimo measurements		As a cost-effective localization scheme, radio tomographic imaging (RTI) has become a hot topic in the field of indoor positioning. In most previous works, the received signal strength (RSS), which is extremely unstable in indoor multipath environments, is used as the measurement. In this paper, we propose to leverage the fine-grained channel state information (CSI) for RTI. Further, by incorporating the multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) technique, we establish the CSI-MIMO attenuation model which utilizes the benefits of frequency diversity and spatial diversity. In addition, we also change the signal frequency to a higher one which can enhance the shadowing loss. We conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of CSI-MIMO based RTI. Experimental results show that the localization accuracy of the proposed method can be considerably improved compared with the RSS-based RTI methods.

CWS-IVCAL takes into consideration the location estimate uncertainty maintained by vehicles that use IVCAL as a localization technique. In IVCAL, communication among vehicles is utilized to compute inter-vehicle distances, which are integrated with motion information and GPS measurements in order to improve vehicle location estimates in multipath environments. The proposed scheme was tested and compared with a regular IVCAL scheme in a variety of simulated road segment scenarios. CWS-IVCAL has shown resilience not just against GPS unreliability in urban environments but also against erroneous inter-vehicle distance estimates. It is evident from the simulation that utilizing more location information has the potential to lead to improvement in the robustness and accuracy of vehicle location estimation.	chrome web store;global positioning system;heuristic;internationalization and localization;mathematical optimization;multipath propagation;polynomial-time approximation scheme;simulation	Nabil Mohamed Drawil;Otman A.

The output power level distributions have been obtained through network-based measurements. In downlink, data from 868 RBSs were gathered during seven days. The RBSs were connected to five different radio network controllers (RNCs) located in different regions of India. The mean, the median, and the 95th percentile RBS output power values were found to be 24%, 21%, and 53%, respectively, of the maximum available power. In the uplink direction, output power levels of 3G devices connected to 1256 RBSs and the same five RNCs as in the downlink were assessed separately for voice, data, voice + data, and video applications. In total, more than 1 million hours of data traffic and more than 700 000 h of voice calls were measured in the uplink. The mean output power for the voice, data, the voice + data, and the video were found to be around 1%, 3%, 2%, and 4%, respectively, of the maximum available power for the 3G user devices. The findings are in line with previously published results obtained in other networks in Europe, and demonstrate that knowledge on realistic power levels is important for accurate assessments of the RF EMF exposure.	eclipse modeling framework;rf modulator;radio frequency;telecommunications link;telecommunications network	Paramananda Joshi;Mukesh Agrawal;Bjorn Thors;Davide Colombi;Ashwani Kumar;Christer Tornevik	2015	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2453056	telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;human factors and ergonomics	Mobile	24.133764627420845	80.81589394625261	195669

In such a scenario, the more accurate the delay estimation is, the more precise user position computation will be. This paper derives a criterion to improve position accuracy, based on minimizing the variance of time-delay estimation at the receiver. In particular, it focuses on designing sequences with specified constraints on the aperiodic auto-correlation sequence. The techniques used to meet such constraints are based on difference sets obtained from power residue classification.	algorithm;autocorrelation;code;computation;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;numerical analysis;pseudorange;satellite navigation	Giacomo Bacci;Marco Luise	2006	2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;real-time computing;geography;telecommunications;delay spread	EDA	23.839559372215835	75.70556390281631	196310

WiFi-based indoor localization has been attractive due to its open access and low cost properties. However, the distance estimation based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is easily affected by the temporal and spatial variance due to the multipath effect, which contributes to most of the estimation errors in current systems. In this work, we analyze this effect across the physical layer and account for the undesirable RSSI readings being reported. We explore the frequency diversity of the subcarriers in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems and propose a novel approach called FILA, which leverages the channel state information (CSI) to build a propagation model and a fingerprinting system at the receiver. We implement the FILA system on commercial 802.11 NICs, and then evaluate its performance in different typical indoor scenarios. The experimental results show that the accuracy and latency of distance calculation can be significantly enhanced by using CSI. Moreover, FILA can significantly improve the localization accuracy compared with the corresponding RSSI approach.	channel state information;chipset;experiment;fingerprint (computing);frequency divider;indoor positioning system;location awareness;location-based service;mimo;multipath propagation;multiplexing;network packet;smartphone;software propagation;subcarrier	Kaishun Wu;Jiang Xiao;Youwen Yi;Dihu Chen;Xiaonan Luo;Lionel M.

However, there are currently no models describing the radio channel around the human body making it difficult to design a suitable communication system. To address this problem, we have simulated electromagnetic wave propagation around the body and incorporated these results into a simple model. We then compared this model with measurements taken around the human torso and with previous studies in the literature. This paper proposes a simple statistical channel model useful for evaluating both UWB and (after resampling) narrow-band body area communication systems.	channel (communications);multipath propagation;sensor;software propagation;systems design;ultra-wideband	Andrew Fort;Claude Desset;Julien Ryckaert;Philippe De Doncker;Leo Van Biesen;Stéphane Donnay	2005	IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2005.

For a typical WSN operating in indoor environments, the localization performance can be degraded considerably due to the existence of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel conditions between the sensor nodes. In these channel conditions the ranging accuracy is degraded due to the attenuation and/or loss of the Direct Path (DP) signal which ultimately imposes a positive bias on the ToA-based distance estimation. As a result there is a need for robust algorithms that have the capability to identify and mitigate those NLOS ranging conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel, low complexity wireless channel condition estimation algorithm that identifies the condition of the channel. Based on the estimated ToA and Received Signal Strength (RSS) the algorithm identifies the channel condition which can be either LOS, NLOS - DP available, or NLOS - DP not available. A channel measurement campaign was conducted in an office environment and the measurement results confirms the validity of our algorithm. To integrate our channel condition estimation into the localization schemes, we propose two weight assignment schemes which generate either a “soft weight” or a “hard weight”. Simulation results show that our estimator has robust performance with success rate of 85%. The simulations also show that by taking advantage of the channel condition estimation, we are able to reduce the RMSE of the localization estimate by over 40%.	algorithm;channel (communications);labview;line-of-sight (missile);location-based service;rss;simulation;time of arrival;ultra-wideband	Nayef Alsindi;Chunjie Duan;Jinyun Zhang;Tsutomu Tsuboi	2009	2009 6th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication	10.1109/WPNC.2009.4907804	electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;non-line-of-sight propagation;statistics;computer network	Mobile	20.84817744435267	74.56444233169282	199456

This paper focuses on a two-way, time of flight (ToF) te chnique which achieves good accuracy in estimating the point-to-point di s ance between two wireless nodes. The underlying idea is to utilize a two-way t ime transfer approach in order to avoid the need for clock synchronization b etween the participating wireless nodes. Moreover, by employing multipl e ToF measurements, sub-clock resolution is achieved. A calibration stage is us ed to estimate the various delays that occur during a message exchange and require subtraction from the initial timed value. The calculation of the range betwee n the nodes takes place on-node making the proposed scheme suitable for distribute d systems. Care has been taken to exclude the erroneous readings from the set of m easurements that are used in the estimation of the desired range. The two-way T oF technique has been implemented on commercial off-the-self (COTS) device s without the need for additional hardware. The system has been deployed in var ous experimental locations both indoors and outdoors and the obtained result s reveal that accuracy between 1m RMS and 2.5m RMS in line-of-sight conditions over a 42m range can be achieved.	12-hour clock;clock synchronization;effective method;embedded system;limbo;line-of-sight (missile);mind;point-to-point protocol;rf modulator;radio frequency;record management services;transfer-based machine translation	Evangelos B.
