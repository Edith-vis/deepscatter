Given a moving query and a set of moving objects, a future query asks for the set of objects that satisfy the query in a given time interval. The difficulty in such a case is that both the query and the data objects change positions continuously, and therefore we can not rely on a given fixed reference position to determine the answer. Existing techniques are either based on sampling, or on repetitive application of time-parameterized queries in order to provide the answer. In this paper we develop an efficient method in order to process nearestneighbor queries in moving-object databases. The basic advantage of the proposed approach is that only one query is issued per time interval. The Time-Parameterized R-tree structure is used to index the moving objects. An extensive performance evaluation, based on CPU and I/O time, shows that significant improvements are achieved compared to existing techniques.	central processing unit;input/output;nearest neighbor search;parameter (computer programming);performance evaluation;r-tree;sampling (signal processing);temporal database;tree structure;velocity (software development)	Katerina Raptopoulou;Apostolos N.

Consistency means here that the results of reasoning with the qualitative representation hold in the underlying (quantitative) dynamic system. In the formalization proposed in this paper, the quantitative structure is represented using the notion of a general dynamic system (GDS). The qualitative counterpart (QDS), is represented by a finite-state automaton structure. The two representational substructures are related through functions, called qualitative abstractions of dynamic systems. Qualitative abstractions associate inputs, states and outputs of the QDS with partitions of appropriate GDS spaces. The paper shows how to establish such consistent partitions, given a partitioning of the system’s output. To represent borders of these partitions, the notion of critical hypersurfaces is introduced. One of the main ideas that provides consistency is the interpretation of qualitative input events as elements of the partition of the Cartesian product of input, initial state and time sets. An example of a consistent qualitativdquantitative representation of a simple dynamic system, and of reasoning using such a representation, is provided.	automaton;cartesian closed category;finite-state machine;graph dynamical system	Mieczyslaw M.
