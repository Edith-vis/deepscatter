In a multicultural world, ontological differences are a fundamental obstacle that must be overcome before inter-cultural communication can occur. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the issues faced by agents operating in large-scale multi-cultural environments and to argue for systems that are tolerant of heterogeneity, illustrating the discussion with a running example of researching and comparing university web sites as a realistic scenario representative of many current knowledge management tasks that would benefit from agent assistance. We then discuss the efforts of the Intelligent Agent Laboratory toward designing such tolerant systems, giving a detailed presentation of the results of several implementations.

baeecd9de597fb901bb82607c050a7b6388c0b64	an assumption-based localization technique for switching system	fault localization;switched system;large scale;expert system	In troubleshooting large scale equipments, fault localization interferences involve indeterminateness and they might lead to erroneous conclusions. To realize indeterminate inferences, an assumption-based fault localization technique has been developed. The technique allows inferences based on indeterminate assumptions. When inconsistencies are discovered, assumption are revised. The technique also enables flexible diagnosis control, such as reasoning based on anticipated test results without actually carrying out the tests. When the anticipated results become doubtful, it activates the omitted tests. The paper describes the technique and an outline of the troubleshooting expert system for electronic switching systems based on the technique.	electronic switching system;expert system;indeterminacy in concurrent computation	Shin-ichi Wada;Yoshiyuki Koseki	1989		10.1145/66617.66618	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;expert system	AI	-19.71516222267972	-3.254014076270174	197489

For non-trivial domains, such plan libraries have complex structures representing possible agent behaviour to achieve a plan. Existing plan recognition approaches are seldom tested at their limits, and, though they use conceptually similar plan library representations, they rarely use the exact same domain in order to directly compare their performance, leading to the need for a principled approach to evaluating them. Thus, we develop a mechanism to automatically generate arbitrarily complex plan libraries which can be directed through a number of parameters, in order to create plan libraries representing different domains and so allowing systematic experimentation and comparison among the several plan recognition algorithms. We validate our mechanism by carrying out an experiment to evaluate the performance of a known plan recognition algorithm.	algorithm;knowledge base;library (computing);standard business reporting	Giovani Parente Farias;Lucas Welter Hilgert;Felipe Meneguzzi;Rafael H.

7f17db1b4f865519818b95c4d34bdda50048cd8f	a formal framework of conversational goals based on strategic reasoning	formal framework;strategic reasoning;conversational goal;argumentation-based reasoning;strategic goal;original characteristic	In this paper, we propose a formal framework of strategic reasoning that agents use when interacting in a dialogue and trying to achieve their conversational goals. Such argumentation-based reasoning enables agents to generate a set of strategic goals depending on a set of constraints. Strategic goals are sub-goals, which are necessary to achieve a conversational goal. Some of these sub-goals are generated at the beginning of the interaction and they can be canceled or substituted by alternatives during the dialogue. An original characteristic of this framework is that it enables agents to persist in the achievement of their goals by considering alternatives and calculating the feasibility of each sub-goal. The set of constraints as well as sub-goals can be set at the beginning or during the dialogue.	case-based reasoning;goal programming;interaction	Mohamed Mbarki;Jamal Bentahar;Bernard Moulin	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-69052-8_87	computer science;knowledge management;management science	AI	-21.499805478490575	-9.236043755630844	198660
2fe9df8cacb1d8aa1f700f3aac001d1cf096d470	a service agents division method based on semantic negotiation of concepts		In the process of Web service discovery, it is necessary to use ontology for negotiation and interaction between service participating agents, and the accuracy of service discovery is greatly influenced by the heterogeneity of ontology and the mistaken understanding of messages. The method based on concept semantic negotiation is proposed, which completed semantic negotiation through concept explanation, improved the concept understanding ability of service agent, and divided the agents which have similar functions and understanding ability into the same services community according to the result of negotiation. Finally, an experimental comparison between our method and other methods is presented, the results show that the semantic negotiation method has the least error rate.
