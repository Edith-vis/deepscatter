The results are derived from a channel measurement campaign performed at 5.6 GHz in four different types of urban intersections. We present results on typical power delay profiles, pathloss and delay spreads and discuss important propagation mechanisms. By comparing the results of the different intersections, we find that absence of line-of-sight is problematic for system coverage, especially when there are few other significant scattering objects in and around the intersection. Roadside buildings can create important propagation paths that account for a considerable part of the total received power.	line-of-sight (missile);maximal set;software propagation;vehicle-to-vehicle	Johan Karedal;Fredrik Tufvesson;Taimoor Abbas;Oliver Klemp;Alexander Paier;Laura Bernadó;Andreas F.

Then, it describes the 60-GHz channel-propagation characteristics and proposes antenna solutions, as well as the architecture of the RF part, including a channelization scheme and frequency synthesizer architecture. With regard to the baseband part, we discuss the use of multicarrier modulation and compare it to single-carrier modulation.

A novel relationship is found allowing the estimation of the root-mean-square (rms) delay spread from such data. Furthermore, we describe a set of equations that can be used for fitting the (measured) channel parameters to a mathematical model, the so-called frequency-domain (FD) model. We also show a simulation procedure, which directly implements the mathematical description of the channel. The output of this procedure—realizations of frequency-selective channel transfer functions—may be used for instance in the investigation of OFDM systems. The study is restricted to the small-scale modeling; Rayleigh and Ricean fading channels are considered. The estimation of the rms delay spread is based on the frequency-domain level crossing rate (LCRf ), which is derived from the FD-channel model. It is shown that the rms delay spread is proportional to the LCR f . Because of the simple hardware required for finding the LCR f , the suggested measurement method is particularly interesting for the millimeter-wave frequency band ( 30 GHz). However, it can be used at other frequencies as well, where standard laboratory equipment is sufficient for conducting the measurements. The accuracy of this technique depends on the bandwidth observed and can be increased further by combining multiple measurements performed within a small local area.	bandwidth (signal processing);channel (communications);dispersive partial differential equation;frequency band;mathematical model;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation	Klaus Witrisal;Yong-Ho Kim;Ramjee Prasad	2001	IEEE Trans.

And the fading characteristics are analyzed from the measured data, especially Rician K-factor. Properties of fading in DAS in detail are analyzed by applying actual measured channel data within the aircraft while most literatures usually focus on fading characteristics of indoor scenario. Meanwhile, the coverage of K-factor in cabin between seat backrests and seats is compared. Moreover, the fading characteristics in the three frequency bands in aircraft are also analyzed in the paper.

This paper focuses on the special fading characteristics of viaduct and hilly terrain scenarios based on the extensive and practical multiple input multiple output (MIMO) measurements which is conducted on Harbin-Dalian passenger dedicated railway line at 2.6 GHz with a bandwidth of 40 MHz. Here, we provide the power delay profiles as the first analytical results. Large-scale fading parameters such as path loss and shadow fading are given and discussed. As for small-scale fading, two similar but not identical K-factor models in different scenario are presented for comparison. Through the analysis on the two typical scenarios, this paper provides great guiding significance for promoting evaluation, simulation and design of the wireless communication system based on Long Term Evolution Railway (LTE-R).	algorithm;breakpoint;compaq lte;hierarchical state routing;k-factor (cisco);mimo;simulation;terrain rendering;transceiver	Xiangli Lin;Chunxiu Xu;Siyu Zhang;Ruojun Zhao;Xiao Xiang	2014	2014 International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)	10.1109/WPMC.2014.7014804	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;fading;wireless;statistics;measurement uncertainty	Mobile	26.13263664025444	79.22464737880266	157712

7582d0824d253123ce414f74ec01a2e5f208a177	physical layer authentication in mission-critical mtc networks: a security and delay performance analysis		We study the detection and delay performance impacts of a feature-based physical layer authentication (PLA) protocol in mission-critical machine-type communication (MTC) networks. The PLA protocol uses generalized likelihood-ratio testing based on the line-of-sight (LOS), single-input multipleoutput channel-state information in order to mitigate impersonation attempts from an adversary node. We study the detection performance, develop a queueing model that captures the delay impacts of erroneous decisions in the PLA (i.e., the false alarms and missed detections), and model three different adversary strategies: data injection, disassociation, and Sybil attacks. Our main contribution is the derivation of analytical delay performance bounds that allow us to quantify the delay introduced by PLA that potentially can degrade the performance in mission-critical MTC networks. For the delay analysis, we utilize tools from stochastic network calculus. Our results show that with a sufficient number of receive antennas (approx. 4-8) and sufficiently strong LOS components from legitimate devices, PLA is a viable option for securing mission-critical MTC systems, despite the low latency requirements associated to corresponding use cases. Furthermore, we find that PLA can be very effective in detecting the considered attacks, and in particular, it can significantly reduce the delay impacts of disassociation and Sybil attacks.	adversary (cryptography);approximation;authentication;channel state information;line-of-sight (missile);mission critical;network calculus;profiling (computer programming);programmable logic array;queueing theory;requirement;sensor;sybil attack	Henrik Forssell;Ragnar Thobaben;Hussein Al-Zubaidy;James Gross	2018	CoRR		computer network;physical layer;adversary;network calculus;mission critical;computer science;use case;queueing theory;authentication;stochastic process	Metrics	31.30890161822558	75.53774521255835	158746

Channel models have to be approximated to reach reasonable complexity of practical radio channel simulators, but the approximation should not cause too high error in the simulation. The error of the MIMO correlation matrix can be measured via different metrics such as correlation matrix distance (CMD) and mean square error (MSE). This paper compares the different metrics of correlation error, and investigates the impact of different approximations on the MIMO correlation matrix. From the results it was found that a modified MSE (Mod-MSE) presented in this paper and CMD have quite similar behavior, but Mod-MSE is independent of the correlation matrix size and the level of the original correlation. Thus, Mod-MSE shows only the error on correlation. Channel model approximations are, e.g., limited number of impulse responses, phase error between the channels, and synchronization error in simulator start-up. The impact of the approximations is investigated via the CMD and Mod-MSE analysis. The results show that the number of impulse responses should be in the order of 100 000 or more, phase error of less than 5 degrees is acceptable, and the synchronization error is critical when highly correlated channels are simulated. Another result of this paper is that the Mod-MSE is more recommendable metric than CMD.	approximation algorithm;channel (communications);creative micro designs;mimo;mean squared error;mod database;simulation;synchronization (computer science)	Tommi Jämsä;Pekka Kyösti;Jari H.

Our approach enables the design of efficient and accurate simulation models for wideband space-time MIMO channels under isotropic scattering conditions. Two methods will be provided to compute the parameters of the simulation model. Especially, the space, time, and frequency correlation properties of the proposed wideband space-time MIMO channel simulator are studied analytically. It is shown that any given discrete or continuous power delay profile (PDP) can be incorporated in the simulation model. The high accuracy of the simulation model is demonstrated by comparing its statistical properties with those of the underlying reference model. Our procedure provides an important framework for developers of future wideband mobile communication systems to test and to verify new high data rate transmission concepts employing, e.g., space-time coded MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) techniques.	acf;channel (communications);computation;data rate units;frequency divider;mimo;mathematical optimization;microsoft customer care framework;multiplexing;reference model;selectivity (electronic);simulation;time complexity;whole earth 'lectronic link	Matthias Pätzold;Bjørn Olav Hogstad	2006	IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VTCF.2006.39	3g mimo;electronic engineering;real-time computing;reference model;mimo-ofdm;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;space time;simulation modeling;mathematics;space–time code;spatial multiplexing;statistics;mimo;broadband networks	EDA	27.42638058263845	77.58804729777036	160605

The setup used in these measurements emulates the future fifth-generation (5G) cellular systems for both access and backhaul services, as well as for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. We used our measurement data to develop the corresponding large-scale propagation path loss models at 60 GHz, using the log-distance and the floating intercept modeling approaches. It is shown that cellular radio links can be established in short-range distances up to 134 m indoors, and up to 77 m outdoors, when employing highly directional antennas at both the transmitter and receiver sides. It is also shown that path loss at 60 GHz in hot and sunny weather during the day, is higher than those obtained in cool and clear weather at night. This is partly due to solar radio noise effect arising from the intense solar radiation that characterizes summer afternoon in Riyadh city, which can cause a decrease in carrier-to-noise ratio at the input of receiving antennas. It is also partly due to the increase in thermal noise when electronics components in the measurement device become hot. The results presented here are thus very useful in 5G cellular design and infrastructure planning in the gulf region, where daytime temperature could reach 43° C or more.	backhaul (telecommunications);carrier-to-noise ratio;emulator;gulf of evaluation;johnson–nyquist noise;machine to machine;mobile phone;noise (radio);software propagation;transmitter;visual intercept	Ahmed Iyanda Sulyman;Abdulmalik Alwarafy;Hussein E.

Extensive research efforts have been made to develop V2V channel models to be implemented in advanced VANET system simulators for performance evaluation. The impact of shadowing caused by other vehicles has, however, largely been neglected in most of the models, as well as in the system simulations. In this paper we present a simple shadow fading model targeting system simulations based on real world measurements performed in urban and highway scenarios. The measurement data is separated for the situations like line-of-sight (LOS), the obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) by vehicles, and non line-ofsight (NLOS) by buildings with the help of video information available during measurements. It is observed that the vehicles obstructing LOS induce an additional attenuation of about 10dB in the received signal power. We use a Markov chain based state transition diagram to model transitions from LOS to obstructed LOS and present an example of state transition intensities for a real traffic mobility model. We also provide a simple recipe, how to incorporate our shadow fading model in VANET network simulators.	channel (communications);computer simulation;decibel;hoc (programming language);line-of-sight (missile);performance evaluation;robertson–seymour theorem;software propagation;vehicle-to-vehicle	Taimoor Abbas;Fredrik Tufvesson;Johan Karedal	2012	CoRR	10.1155/2015/190607	simulation;telecommunications	Mobile	27.396143191533717	78.48541325290616	163931

It is shown that reducing the antenna side lobe level increases the sector capacity. Also, it is shown that the sector range that gives the quasi the maximum sector capacity is in the order of 800 to 1200 m.	acoustic lobing;breakpoint;coefficient;interference (communication);multiservice switch;software propagation;telecommunications link	Bazil Taha Ahmed;Miguel Calvo-Ramón	2007	EURASIP J.

To avoid complicated procedure in deriving the analytical expressions of the channel parameters and functions, the channel is realized first, then the time-varying channel properties and parameters are investigated. In this work, we extend the proposed narrowband model to wideband and also introduce the carrrier frequency and bandwidth into the model.	mimo;stationary process;vehicle-to-vehicle	Xiaolin Liang;Xiongwen Zhao;Shu Li;Qi Wang;Jingchun Li	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343670	3g mimo;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;scattering;precoding;statistics;computer network;transceiver;mimo	Arch	27.096199817982917	77.98375256252801	164681

d6c65b365771513779b77f29fb1e68a1b8024061	impact of body mass index on ultrawideband mimo ban channels—measurements and statistical model		Wireless body area networks (BANs) have many important applications such as wearable communication devices and Internet of Things. Wireless propagation in on-body channels has been measured and modeled in the past. However, a crucial element that is usually ignored is the impact of the body size of the user—a 50-kg person obviously creates a different on-body channel than a 150-kg person. The status-quo “one-size-fits-all” approach to channel characterization in BAN is thus incomplete. In this paper, we provide a detailed description of a propagation measurement campaign that employs a self-developed  $4 \times 4$  ultrawideband multiple-input-multiple-output array channel sounding system to perform BAN channel sounding both in an anechoic chamber and indoor laboratory environments. A total of 60 human subjects were investigated in our work. These human subjects had widely varying body mass index (BMI) values, which were grouped into three different categories, i.e., 20 per BMI category. Various propagation properties such as path gain, frequency-decay factor, shadowing gain, rms delay spread, amplitude fading, and spatial correlation are extracted for each on-body channel under consideration. A comparison of statistics among the BMI categories reveals considerable differences, emphasizing the fact that the aforementioned propagation properties are BMI dependent. Parameters such as path gain showed a monotonic decrease across the BMI categories with values ranging from 1–2 to almost 13 dB in some channels. This paper proposes a propagation channel model for the BMI-dependent parameters and validates that it can reproduce the measured channel capacities.	automatic sounding;brain–computer interface;channel (communications);complement (complexity);emoticon;fits;human body weight;internet of things;k-factor (cisco);mimo;observable;simulation;software propagation;spatial multiplexing;statistical model;systems design;ultra-wideband;wearable computer	Seun Sangodoyin;Andreas F.

While simple radio propagation models are evaluated quickly and are suitable for simple scenarios, sophisticated models can handle more complex environments and provide better accuracy. However, the cost of higher accuracy is slower execution speed. This paper describes experiments that validate ray-tracing and transmission line matrix models of the radio channel, within each approach considering versions that differ in their attention to detail and computational cost. We conducted the experiments under highly controlled conditions, within an anechoic chamber. Our main conclusion is that the errors due to lack of knowledge about beam forms and antennae shape significantly outweigh errors that might have been introduced if the experiments had not been within the anechoic chamber. While seemingly negative, the implication is that for our problem domain and level of information about the wireless environment, complex means of radio isolation aren't needed in validation studies.	algorithmic efficiency;artificial cardiac pacemaker;computation;experiment;problem domain;ray tracing (graphics);repeatability;simulation;software propagation;transmission line	Yuhao Zheng;David M.

It allows each node receiving messages and transmitting information to its neighbors at the same time, and can control the transmissions easily. The RODD model with this codebook can transmit state information at physical layer and save memory for large neighbors, and it will be more convenient for adjusting duty cycle when channel changes. In general, to achieve full duplex communication and ensure its quality, the new RODD scheme based on Tent map is more flexible and efficient.	codebook;duplex (telecommunications);duty cycle;switch;tent map;transmitter;type signature	Yuan Luo;Zuxun Song;Jiaojiao Dang	2018	2018 27th Wireless and Optical Communication Conference (WOCC)	10.1109/WOCC.2018.8372697	wireless network;computer science;computer network;duplex (telecommunications);bit error rate;wireless sensor network;codebook;physical layer;tent map;communication channel	Mobile	30.32379827453326	75.50490401133565	165797

d7e56ac49c37ac850e18651db1991239b5932ff0	total array gains of polarized millimeter-wave mobile phone antennas		This paper studies a gain of an antenna array implemented on a mobile device operating at a millimeter-wave radio frequency. Assuming that mobile phones at millimeterwave range operate with a single transceiver chain and analog beamforming like phased arrays, its total array gain is attributed to average gains of antenna elements and signal precoding or combining gains in excess to received power from a single-element dual-polarized omni-directional antenna. The total array gain circumvents the ambiguity of conventional array gain which cannot be uniquely defined as there are multiple choices of a reference single-element antenna in an array. Different polarized 8-element patch antenna arrays implemented on a mobile phone chassis, i.e., uniform linear array (ULA) and distributed array (DA) operating at 60 GHz, are studied. The antenna elements are placed so that they cover vertical, slanted or horizontal polarizations. The gain is evaluated for different orientations of the chassis along with effects of a body torso and a finger of a person operating the phone. The gain in a small-cell scenario shows that DA achieves higher gains than ULA regardless of polarization states of antenna elements at the base and mobile stations, and of the existence of line-of-sight in the links. Antenna polarizations do not make much impact on the total array gain as random orientation of a mobile phone and finger shadowing modifies the polarization states. The results show that antenna array geometry is more influential design aspect than polarization when a single transceiver chain is considered.	beamforming;charge-coupled device;chassis;finger tree;line-of-sight (missile);mobile device;mobile phone;offset binary;phased array;polarization (waves);radio frequency;transceiver	Katsuyuki Haneda;Mikko Heino;Jan Jarvelainen	2018	2018 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)	10.1109/EuCNC.2018.8442687	precoding;radio frequency;transceiver;mobile phone;array gain;antenna array;beamforming;patch antenna;computer science;electrical engineering	Mobile	25.98279745495315	80.87871450922047	170169
cdddbc4f07bf22c248e956624dc4ca0f7f84c1cc	receiver design in molecular communications: an approach based on artificial neural networks		The design of communication systems typically relies on the development of mathematical models that describe the underlying communication channel. In many communication systems, however, accurate channel models may not be known, or the models may not be accurate enough or even not available for efficient system design. In these scenarios, a completely new approach to communication system design and analysis is required. An example of such situations arises in the emerging research field of molecular communications, for which it is very difficult to develop accurate analytical models for several operating scenarios. In this context, the use of data-driven techniques based on artificial neural networks may provide an alternative and suitable solution towards the design and analysis of molecular communication systems. In this paper, we explore the potential of artificial neural networks for application to the design of robust receiver schemes. We study a molecular communication system in the presence of inter-symbol interference and show that a receiver based on artificial neural networks can be trained by using only empirical (raw) data and can provide the same performance as a receiver that has perfect knowledge of the underlaying channel model.	artificial neural network;channel (communications);interference (communication);mathematical model;neural networks;systems design	Xuewen Qian;Marco Di Renzo	2018	2018 15th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2018.8491088	communications system;real-time computing;mathematical model;theoretical computer science;artificial neural network;molecular communication;computer science;systems design;demodulation;signal-to-noise ratio;communication channel	Arch	29.91902094887115	76.28652691311473	170301

In this paper, a novel method called chainABF is proposed, which, by transmitting multiple ABF symbols, allows the nodes to send multiple bits to the base station reliably with error ratio around 10-4 under typical conditions.In addition, the False Positive and False Negative error ratios are reduced by an order of magnitude when compared to the raw error ratios. The gain of chainABF is due to an intelligent coding scheme, which are the key contributions of this paper. chainABF is a wrapper over ABF, making it applicable to any network employing any kind of ABF on various physical layer signals.

557341516340b5d4ab1c4b0e616cd684a81ca9af	geometry descriptors of irregular microphone arrays related to beamforming performance	signal image and speech processing;quantum information technology spintronics	Performance analysis for microphone arrays with irregular geometries typically requires direct computation of beamforming gains over the spatial and frequency ranges of interest. However, theses computations can be very consuming and limit synthesis methods for applications that require rapid answers, as in the case of surveillance and mobile platforms. A better understanding of microphone arrangements and their impact on performance can result in more efficient objective functions for optimizing array performance. This article, therefore, analyzes the relationship between irregular microphone geometries and spatial filtering performance with Monte Carlo simulations. Novel geometry descriptors are developed to capture the properties of irregular microphone distributions showing their impact on array performance. Performance metrics are computed from three-dimensional beam patterns through a delay and sum beamformer with a fixed number of microphones for irregular arrays and comparable regular arrays. Statistical analysis and Multi-way Analysis of Variance establish relationships between key performance metrics and proposed geometry descriptors. It is demonstrated that in conjunction with array centroid offset and dispersion, statistics of the microphone differential path distance can explain variations of performance metrics when steering at targets for immersive or near-field microphone applications.	beamforming;computation;microphone;mobile device;monte carlo method;simulation	Jingjing Yu;Kevin D.

But in practice human bodies and furniture presence induce a considerable fluctuation leading to huge differences between predictions and real measurements. In this paper a new indoor large scale path loss empirical model is presented. The model design, in addition to the considered phenomena in conventional empirical formulation, integrates additional suggestions recommended by electromagnetic techniques such as body shadowing and furniture effects. To achieve this work, a large number of experimental measurements have been carried on and saved in consequently voluminous databases. Their management and exploitation have considered data mining and especially neural networks to perform the new model called neural model. To prove model enhancement and accuracy we compare the “neural model” predictions with measurements. Obtained results show that the mean error is close to zero, the standard deviation is about 4.47 dB with a correlation factor of 97%.	artificial neural network;data mining;database;decibel;quantum fluctuation;software propagation	Mohamad Ayadi;Aymen Ben Zineb	2014	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2014.2339275	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;mathematical model;mathematics;shadow mapping;computational model;statistics	Visualization	24.801278231375058	78.27273814352971	174834

Results are based on the experimental test measurements made at the University of Oulu, Finland using simple high power UWB transmitter prototypes as interference sources. Preliminary results showed that, under the extreme conditions of this experiment, both IEEE802.11b and Bluetooth networks will slightly suffer from the existence of several high proximity UWB signals. In our study, several high power UWB transmitters that greatly exceed the FCC radiation regulations have been used, and the measurement settings presents the worst case scenario due to the very short distance between the interferers and the victim system. Effectively our study indicates the use of hundreds of FCC compatible UWB devices at a same space.	bluetooth;interference (communication);performance;transmitter;ultra-wideband;worst-case scenario	Matti Hämäläinen;Jani Saloranta;Juha-Pekka Mäkelä;Ian Oppermann;Tero Patana	2003	14th IEEE Proceedings on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, 2003.

a13e1648e66efacaca7cc23f0f2b348d82fa2f02	cooperative dynamic angle of arrival estimation considering space–time correlations for terahertz communications		Angle of arrival (AoA) estimation is required by adaptive directive antennas in order to realize a high antenna gain, which is necessary for future indoor terahertz communications due to its extremely high path loss. This paper proposes an AoA estimation algorithm using belief propagation in a dynamic scenario, where the user equipment (UE) is moving during the data transmission, based on the space-time correlations of AoA change. The temporal correlation of AoA change is due to the limited moving speed and statistical movement pattern. Furthermore, if we have distributed antennas or hybrid massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) array, the AoA changes of different antennas reveal spatial correlation because all the AoA changes are caused by the same spatial displacement of UE. This spatial correlation is utilized in this paper to further improve the estimation accuracy by passing messages between antennas and combining the intrinsic estimate by each antenna and extrinsic information from other antennas. In order to demonstrate the algorithm performance, a distributed antenna system and a hybrid massive MIMO array (an array of multiple directive antenna arrays) are considered as application scenarios. The simulation results show that the cooperative estimation brings significant advantage in both scenarios in respect of mean effective antenna gain and level crossing rate.	algorithm;angle of arrival;bayesian approaches to brain function;belief propagation;directive (programming);displacement mapping;ipython;mimo;message passing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;stochastic matrix	Bile Peng;Ke Guan;Thomas K&#x00FC;rner	2018	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2018.2854565	real-time computing;antenna gain;distributed antenna system;belief propagation;spatial correlation;mimo;mathematics;path loss;data transmission;angle of arrival	Mobile	29.072060459615432	77.61535982753546	178305

MmWave spectrum provides unique advantages such as availability of GHz bandwidth and use of antenna arrays with beamforming to compensate for path loss. While there exist well-established models for mmWave indoor non-line-of-sight (60 GHz) and mmWave outdoor line-of-sight (backhaul) communication, mmWave channels for outdoor, non-line-of-sight, mobile communication have not been explored sufficiently. We present penetration and reflection measurements for different materials and line-of-sight and non- line-of-sight measurements for outdoor mmWave mobile communication. We find that while well-known lossy objects such as human body and concrete can have poor penetration, they are good reflectors at these frequencies, enabling the receiver to capture secondary reflections for non-line-of-sight communication. We also show that a wide beam width, low gain antenna at the mobile receiver can capture more energy in scattered non-line-of-sight environments and thus, can provide more gain than a narrow beam, high gain antenna for mobile communication. Our initial measurements motivate utilizing mmWave frequencies for outdoor non-line- of-sight mobile communication.	backhaul (telecommunications);beamforming;existential quantification;line-of-sight (missile);lossy compression;mobile app;mobile phone;reflection (computer graphics);reflection (computer programming)	Sridhar Rajagopal;Shadi Abu-Surra;Mehrzad Malmirchegini	2012	2012 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2012.6398884	electronic engineering;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;radio receiver	Mobile	25.688603412676763	80.63309915555627	180962

This model relates the stochastic properties of the radio channel to the underlying geometry of the investigated environment. The geometric simplicity of the millimeter-wave channel allows examining fundamental deterministic properties of the wave propagation behavior in environments of predefined randomness, i.e., environments whose dimensions and properties are described by various probability distributions. The influence of the randomness on the radio channel is studied for the down-link of a wireless local area network at 60 GHz. Joint amplitudes of path lengths, angles of departure, and amplitudes, as well as spatial power densities, average power of the direct paths, and factors are investigated.	channel (communications);randomness;software propagation;telecommunications link	Jan Hansen	2002	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2002.801227	probability distribution;stochastic process;index term;telecommunications;wave propagation;radio propagation model;power density;probability;extremely high frequency;statistics;computer network	Mobile	26.86980712919531	78.08699435011314	181031

While there have been several attempts to mitigate the impact of RF interference on (body) sensor networks, e.g. via frequency hopping, it is often unclear how these solutions perform in different interference environments and when they are actually useful. This is not least due to a lack of knowledge about the characteristics of environmental 2.4 GHz RF noise as perceived by a BSN in realistic scenarios. Such knowledge would, for example, help to better understand the communication challenges in a BSN and derive design decisions for interference mitigation techniques. Our work targets this under explored area: we present the results from an urban measurement campaign, in which a mobile BSN collected about half a billion RF noise samples in various urban environments (park, campus, residential area, shopping street, urban transportation system). Our setup captured the entire 2.4 GHz band, on five different body positions simultaneously. Among other things, our results indicate that WLAN was the dominating source of 2.4 GHz RF noise, significant spectrum activity was typically detected during about 5% of the time, but there is a large variation among the scenarios, and, to detect the presence of RF interference the body position is of no of major importance, however, the difference in interference power measured at two different body positions is not negligible.	experiment;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;interference (communication);rf modulator;radio frequency;sfiaplus	Jan-Hinrich Hauer;Daniel Willkomm	2012	2012 Ninth International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks	10.1109/BSN.2012.10	electromagnetic interference;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	25.013097291495054	79.69047917418958	181931

To characterize the mmWave channel in urban areas, wideband propagation measurements at 73 GHz have recently been made in New York City. Using the measurements, a ray-tracing study has been conducted using databases for the same environments as the measurements, allowing a simple ray-tracer to predict measured statistics such as path loss and angles of arrival in the same physical environment of the measurements. In this paper a preliminary 3GPP-style 3D mmWave channel model is developed with special emphasis on using the ray tracer to determine elevation model parameters. The channel model includes distance-dependent elevation modeling which is critical for the expected 2D arrays which will be employed at mmWave.	channel (communications);database;ray tracing (graphics);software propagation	Timothy A.

It is shown that, in the aforementioned legacy MMF systems, centre launching enables an adaptive power-loaded 11.25Gb/s OOFDM transmission over an unprecedented distance of 2000m with an optical power penalty as low as 0.8dB. When centre launching is replaced by conventional offset launching, the transmission distance of the legacy MMF system is reduced to 300m and the corresponding optical power penalty is increased to 2.3dB. Comparisons of measured maximum achievable transmission distances of various MMF IMDD system configurations subject to different launching conditions show that DM-VCSEL-based, adaptive power-loaded OOFDM at centre launching is a viable and cost-effective solution for use in legacy MMF systems. This work may have great potential for upgrading installed MMF local area networks to 10Gb/s and beyond.	end-to-end principle;incremental funding methodology;legacy system;modulation;real-time clock;real-time transcription;world wide web	E.

The potential gains using these techniques have been evaluated in a field measurement campaign with a testbed implementation. A downlink throughput exceeding 1 Gbps has been achieved combining 8×8 MIMO in an outdoor macro scenario with carrier aggregation using three component carriers (3×20 MHz). The relation between the achievable throughput and the channel richness arising from the physical environment and antenna spacing was demonstrated. The performance of MIMO setups ranging from 1×2 up to 8×8 was evaluated in indoor-to-indoor, outdoor-to-indoor, and outdoor-to-outdoor deployments. It was observed that each added transmit or receive antenna increased the throughput. These gains were achieved with a compact UE antenna that is reasonable in size for implementation in a consumer device.	compaq lte;data rate units;inverted-f antenna;mimo;rel;telecommunications link;testbed;throughput	Karl Werner;Henrik Asplund;Björn Halvarsson;Anton K.

Plots of the received energy over azimuth, elevation, and delay planes suggest that the incident waves group to clusters in most measured transmitter positions. A super-resolution algorithm (Unitary ESPRIT) allows to resolve individual multipath components in such clusters and hence enables a detailed statistical analysis of the propagation properties. The origins of clusters { sometimes even individual multipath components { such as street apertures, large buildings, roof edges, or building corners can be localized on the city map. Street guided propagation dominates most of the scenarios (78 97% of the total received power), while quasi line-of-sight over-the-rooftop components are weak (3 13% of the total received power). For this measurement campaign, in 90% of the cases, 75% of the total received power is concentrated in the two strongest clusters, but only 55% in the strongest one. Our analysis yields an exponential decay of power with 8:9dB= s, and a standard deviation of the log-normally distributed deviations from the exponential of 9:0dB. The power of cross-polarized components is 8dB below co-polarized ones on average (vertical transmission).	algorithm;line-of-sight (missile);multipath propagation;software propagation;super-resolution imaging;the wall street journal;time complexity;transmitter	Martin Toeltsch;Juha Laurila;Kimmo Kalliola;Andreas F.

ab59601ea0075c722736355e0c98d06b6f9cf917	algebraic analysis of the poles in the doppler spectrum for vehicle-to-vehicle channels		In vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wireless communications the time-variability of the propagation conditions is a challenge for channel estimation. The width of the Doppler spectrum depends on the propagation delay and the velocity vectors of the vehicles. So far, the time-variant width of the Doppler spectrum has been derived for single-bounce scattering close to the line-of-sight delay and for infinitely large delays. In this contribution, we generalize the time-variant, delay-dependent limiting frequencies for V2V channels for arbitrary delays and velocity vector configurations. The limiting frequencies are obtained by considering the geometric-stochastic channel representation in a prolate spheroidal coordinate system and determining the poles of the resulting Doppler spectrum. The poles in the spectrum are caused by the extrema of the Doppler frequency. Since the global maximum and minimum of the Doppler frequency define the limits of the spectrum, the time-variant delay-dependent width can be calculated in closed form.	channel state information;doppler effect;heart rate variability;line-of-sight (missile);linear algebra;maxima and minima;polynomial;propagation delay;software propagation;vehicle-to-vehicle;velocity (software development)	Michael Walter;Dmitriy Shutin;Armin Dammann	2018	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2018.2810087	mathematical optimization;coordinate system;propagation delay;doppler effect;algebraic analysis;time–frequency analysis;mathematics;scattering;maxima and minima;control theory;communication channel	Mobile	27.615250268444033	77.73890010604875	186810

Specialized modulation of the pulse train provides an effective communication medium with inherent advantages of an UWB system. The multiple frequency nature of the non-traditional ‘‘pulse” formation provides a means of implementing UWB without the necessity of complex pulse formation of the classical UWB. The particular example of the research implemented in this paper allows explicit user choice of the specific UWB frequencies, e.g., ISM frequencies, to avoid current restrictions of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The reported method also contains an implicit property to support secure information transmission to receivers at known distances. The objective of this technique is an easy to form communication pulse having UWB low energy advantages along with the freedom of implementation without license requirements from regulating authorities, while adhering to the set limits of intentional radiators. The method chosen in this case was based on having the sum of energies from multiple frequencies remain within the restricted radiation limits at the correlated receiver. Included in the implementation technique is the inclusion of the signal fading effect as part of the modulation technique. The relevance of this pulse forming technique is in the simplicity of spreading the transmitted power among multiple frequencies without the issue of decay factor in the current methods. The result presented gives two sets of relative amplitudes of the transmitted frequencies identifying the transmitted character, e.g., 0 or 1. A form of amplitude encryption, due to the RF signal fading effect was also presented as advantage in the technique. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

04fb748cb1b591a50af666ea8e559e55eb2e0552	enhanced rfid tag detection accuracy using distributed antenna arrays		An Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system using distributed antenna arrays for interrogating RFID tags in a highly multipath environment is demonstrated. The system makes use of phase diversity and beam steering to overcome fading. The tag detection accuracy is compared to a standard fixed antenna system, showing that the presented system is able to deliver more power to the more challenging tags, and therefore is capable of a higher tag read success rate. It is also shown that, whereas a fixed antenna is capable of scanning a single cell, the ability of a phased array to scan through 360° azimuth leads to a reduction in number of antennas required for a multicell system. The experimental results are validated using a 3D field-based propagation model, which enables visualisation of the power distribution in the field of interest, and provides insight into the improved system performance.	multipath propagation;phased array;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;software propagation;ultra high frequency	Ajeck M.

The measurements were conducted in order to understand the characteristics and especially the variability in spectrum use over different types of areas in a major metropolitan area. Three spectrum analyzers were used in the measurement campaign, one used for long-term measurements at a single location in a given area, with the other two used to sample spectrum use around the stationary measurement point. This measurement approach yields much more detailed information about spectrum use than the typical single-location campaigns reported in the literature. We give a detailed description of the measurement campaign, including the equipment setup and rationale for the choice of areas in which the measurements were conducted. We also present results from the first exploratory data analysis of the obtained data, and study in detail the correlation structures and dynamics in spectrum use in temporal, spatial and frequency domains.	design rationale;exploratory testing;spatial variability;spectrum analyzer;stationary process	Alexandros Palaios;Janne Riihijärvi;Oliver Holland;Andreas Achtzehn;Petri Mähönen	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks	10.1109/DYSPAN.2012.6478126	simulation;geography;telecommunications;analytical chemistry	Metrics	25.606155191384534	78.34946605187916	188067

The trends in modulation formats that match information to the optical wireless channel are considered. This is followed by the discussion of recent transmitter and receiver innovations, particularly the utilisation of diversity transceivers. As a preliminary to the following treatment, the nature and modelling of the optical wireless channel are introduced, with particular emphasis on its unique features in terms of transmitted power constraints and non-negativity. From the examination of modulation formats, on-off-keying remains the format of choice for basic binary transmission, whereas pulse-position modulation and its derivatives are preferred for more sophisticated requirements. The recent introduction of techniques from radio systems employing subcarriers is seen to be the most promising development in modulation techniques at present. In receiver technology, quasi-diffuse systems employing multispot diffusion and angular diversity are significant developments. They offer lower path loss and less multipath dispersion, at a lower transmission power compared to 'conventional' wide-angle diffuse systems, while providing a high level of user mobility compared to line-of-sight transmission. These developments are helping optical wireless systems to fulfil their promise by adopting a philosophy inspired by the radio domain to accommodate operation within a hostile channel.	optical wireless	Roger J.

0a4d0a3d6b738fc01c757ba8c7a7b5d7d7c9d67e	pathloss models for indoor hotspot deployment at 83.5 ghz		Conventional pathloss models are based on the received power from an omnidirectional antenna. Millimeter-wave receivers, conversely, will feature highly directional antennas that can be steered towards the angle with maximum power, exploiting their high gain in order to compensate for the greater pathloss witnessed in the upper spectrum. Hence models for the maximum power are also valuable. In this paper, we present both model types for indoor hotspot deployment at 83.5 GHz. The environments considered - a basement, lobby, and hallway in line- and non-line-of-sight conditions up to 24 m range - are typical of such deployments. To fit the models, a measurement campaign with over 1500 different transmitter- receiver configurations was conducted using a correlation-based channel sounder. Computation of the maximum-power model is enabled by the sounder's custom-designed antenna array which can resolve the receiver power into three-dimensional angles-of-arrival.	computation;line-of-sight (missile);maximum power transfer theorem;software deployment	Camillo Gentile;Jelena Senic;Peter B.

Propagation analysis provides a good initial estimate of the signal characteristics. The ability to accurately predict radio propagation behavior for wireless multimedia services is becoming crucial to system design. Since site measurements are costly, propagation models have been developed as a suitable, low cost, and convenient alternative [1]. A number of studies have been conducted to quantitatively predict the characteristics of propagation in inhabited areas on land having many wireless multimedia service users, resulting in a number propagation prediction models being proposed. However, since very few such studies have been conducted for the sea, which has a different physical layer structure from land, the propagation prediction model for free space has been commonly used. Thus, in this study, I measured the propagation path loss of a 1950 MHz band signal over the sea surface, and analyzed the results by comparing them with the path loss data of a propagation prediction model in free space, which is frequently used to predict the propagation path loss over the sea surface.	software propagation;systems design	Dong-You Choi	2006		10.1007/11753810_44	simulation;systems modeling;telecommunications;computer science;path loss;wireless network;radio propagation;radio propagation model;predictive modelling;free field;log-distance path loss model;information system;physical layer;systems design	Mobile	26.361364140907586	76.20254971202849	190039

The swept-frequency channel sounder offers high time and frequency resolution of 1 ns and 625 kHz, respectively. The high dynamic range (70 dB) and the constant power output enable the nonlinearities of the channel-sounding system to be overcome within the coverage range, which is on the order of a picocell. This paper also reports the measurements and the analysis of wideband propagation data for various indoor radio channels at the 57- to 64-GHz band. The propagation characteristics are assessed for six different propagation environments. The results of the measurements for four environments are compared when horn antennas are employed at both terminal stations, and also when a horn and an omnidirectional antenna are used at the Tx and Rx terminals, respectively. Examining the statistical distributions of the multipath dispersion, the 90th percentile is about the same for both antenna configurations. For all environments under investigation, it was observed that the static delay spread values at the 90th percentile were below 62 ns.	automatic sounding;channel (communications);frequency response;high dynamic range;multipath propagation;software propagation;system of measurement;vendor neutral archive	Andreas G.

2460773ded0cafa07917f7c2e52621a25c0f4150	hough-transform-based cluster identification and modeling for v2v channels based on measurements		In this paper, a recently conducted measurement campaign for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) propagation channel characterization is introduced. Two vehicles carrying a transmitter and a receiver, respectively, have been driven along an eight-lane road with heavy traffic. The measurement was conducted with 100 MHz signal bandwidth at a carrier frequency of 5.9 GHz. Channels are observed consisting of two kinds of channel components, i.e., time-evolving clusters and clutter paths. A novel approach based on Hough transform is proposed to identify the clusters. Based on the cluster identification results, channel characteristics in composite, intracluster, and time-variant levels are analyzed. The parameters investigated include the composite root-mean-square (RMS) delay spreads and power decay versus delay behaviors of clusters and clutter paths, cluster RMS delay spread, cluster RMS Doppler frequency spread, correlations of cluster parameters, and coherence time of parameters of interest. The statistics constitute an empirical stochastic clustered-delay-line channel model focusing on the wideband characteristics observed in the realistic time-variant V2V propagation scenario.	analog delay line;bandwidth (signal processing);carrier frequency;channel (communications);clutter;computer cluster;hough transform;methods of computing square roots;software propagation;transmitter;vehicle-to-vehicle	Xuesong Cai;Bile Peng;Xuefeng Yin;Antonio P&#x00E9;rez Yuste	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2787731	electronic engineering;coherence time;computer science;time–frequency analysis;clutter;wideband;bandwidth (signal processing);delay spread;hough transform;communication channel	Mobile	26.8862322551801	77.938298096755	190382

Measurement data from high-speed railway in viaduct scenario have been analyzed. It is found that a log-normal distribution accurately fits the distribution function of all the investigated parameters. The spatial autocorrelation function of SF, rms DS, and Ricean K-factor can be modeled with an exponential decay function. However, The spatial autocorrelation functions of all three variables are better characterized by a composite of double exponential decaying functions. A positive cross correlation is found between the SF and the Ricean K-factor, while both parameters are negatively correlated with rms DS. All essential parameters required for the implementation of a simulation model considering the joint statistical properties of SF, rms DS, and the Ricean K-factor are provided.	autocorrelation;cross-correlation;fits;k-factor (cisco);simulation;spatial analysis;time complexity	YunLing Guo;Jianhua Zhang;Chi Zhang;Lei Tian	2013	2013 International Workshop on High Mobility Wireless Communications (HMWC)	10.1109/HMWC.2013.6710299	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;statistics	Metrics	26.65697245053567	78.03632404315852	190683

Though still at an early stage, some research efforts have been made and various molecular communication systems have been proposed. However, existing works mainly focus on the synchronous communication schemes where the synchronous assumption is made for simplifying analyses. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous communication scheme for molecular communications. For the proposed scheme, we make extensive analyses and develop an approximation for channel capacity as a general performance measure which also applies to synchronous systems. Beyond the theoretical analysis, we also examine a specific asynchronous system and compare its performance with synchronous systems to confirm the feasibility of asynchronous molecular communications.	approximation;asynchronous system;brownian motion;channel capacity;computer performance;gnu nano;programming paradigm	Y P Hsieh;Po-Jen Shih;Yen-Chi Lee;Ping-Cheng Yeh;Kwang-Cheng Chen	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364963	molecular electronics;computer science;theoretical computer science;channel capacity	EDA	31.591063845093082	77.3544790737215	190951

In SP-MIMO architectures, co-located dual-polarized (DP) antennas are employed at each of the antenna locations, effectively doubling the number of ports without substantially increasing the footprint of antenna arrays. The energy efficiency of CP-MIMO architectures has been explored intensively in literature, however very few results are available for DP-MIMO and SP-MIMO systems, particularly over realistic and imperfect channels. We compare the energy efficiency among single input single output (SISO), CP-MIMO, DP-MIMO and SP-MIMO architectures over various wideband MIMO channels. The comparative performance studies are conducted on a SP-MIMO testbed, which incorporates baseband generators, MIMO channel emulation, a coherent multi-channel receiver, and a host computer for signal processing. Results from the testbed indicate that SP-MIMO offers a significant performance shift relative to SISO and CP-MIMO system, especially at high signal-to-noise-ratios. In this region of operation, SP-MIMO provides average transmit energies per successful received bit that are nearly four times and two times less than for SISO and for CP-MIMO architectures respectively.	baseband;channel state information;coherence (physics);emulator;host (network);mimo;mimo-ofdm;network packet;period-doubling bifurcation;polarization (waves);signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder;spatial multiplexing;spectral efficiency;testbed;transmitter	Jun Chen;Farzad Talebi;Thomas G.

A wideband signal has a large bandwidth-to-center frequency ratio, such that the typical narrowband Doppler spread assumptions do not apply to mobile channels. Instead, we assume a more general temporal scaling phenomenon, i.e., a dilation of the transmitted signal's time support. Based on a uniform ring of scatterers model, we determine that the wideband scattering function, which quantifies the average scale spreading, has a """"bathtub-shaped"""" scale profile. We compare the performances of a scale-lag Rake and a frequency-lag Rake, each capable of leveraging the diversity that results from mobility. Such analysis applies, for example, to ultra-wideband (UWB) radio frequency channels and underwater wideband acoustic channels."""	acoustic cryptanalysis;bathtub curve;dilation (morphology);image scaling;performance;radio frequency;rake;ultra-wideband	Adam R.

The ability of omnidirectional antennas to capture multi-path components coming from all directions has made them a logical choice for MIMO applications. Recently, it has been argued that in some MIMO wireless propagation environments with limited angular spread, directive antennas may actually be beneficial if the power gain of these antennas can compensate the loss of perceived multi-path content. In this work, performance of a compact four-element prototype handset with directive patch antennas is studied in an outdoor-to-indoor 4×4 MIMO wireless system. Measurements confirm that directivity may be used to achieve significant capacity gains if combined with intelligent beam-steering.	angularjs;directive (programming);fractal antenna;mimo;power gain;prototype;software propagation	Amir Ghasemi;Amir Ali Basri;John Sydor	2011	2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference	10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982613	3g mimo;multi-user mimo;microstrip antenna;telecommunications;antenna measurement;gain;beam steering;directional antenna;patch antenna;dipole antenna;mimo	Mobile	25.636568213087603	80.62548806398206	197262

Previously the properties of interference were known only when the nodes are distributed as a homogeneous Poisson point process on the plane. We show the effect of a singular path loss model on the tail distribution of the interference. When the path loss function has a singularity at the origin, the interference is shown to be a heavy-tailed distribution under very mild conditions. When the path loss is bounded, the distribution of the interference is predominantly dictated by the fading. We also provide asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds on the CDF of the interference, and discuss the effectiveness of using a Gaussian approximation for modelling the interference.	approximation;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);loss function;point process;stationary process;transmitter	Radha Krishna Ganti;Martin Haenggi	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594936	wireless ad hoc network;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;telecommunications;mathematics;statistics	Arch	29.872128776528104	77.65196783712672	198516

The rain attenuation prediction model of millimeter waves based on an artificial neural network is proposed for the first time, and the predicted results are compared with the CCIR recommendation model. The results show that the artificial neural network can obtain the nonlinear relation of the rain attenuation and the other factors that affect millimeter wave propagation attenuation and improve the accuracy of rain attenuation prediction with a 1.3 dB increase on average. It is a useful approach to construct the rain attenuation prediction model of millimeter wave with artificial neural network.	artificial neural network;rain fade	Hongwei Yang;Chen He;Hong-Wen Zhu;Wentao Song	2000		10.1109/ISCAS.2000.857049	telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;extremely high frequency;predictive modelling;artificial neural network	ML	25.333706164148023	77.80535213606079	198734

A key network forensics tool is trace back, which can be used to identify true sources of suspects. Both accuracy and secrecy are essential attributes of a successful forensic trace back. In this paper, we present a class of hopping based spread-spectrum techniques for forensic trace back, which fully use the benefits of the spread spectrum approach and preserves a greater degree of secrecy. Our proposed techniques, including Code Hopping-Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (CHDSSS), Frequency Hopping-Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (FH-DSSS), and Time Hopping-Spread Spectrum (TH-DSSS), operate to randomize the effects of marking traffic through both the time and frequency domains. Our simulation study validates these techniques in terms of accuracy and secrecy.	frequency-hopping spread spectrum	Wei Yu;Xinwen Fu;Erik Blasch;Khanh D.

However, in the reality, there are some obstacles like hills and buildings and electromagnetic waves are diffracted and reflected form these obstacles. It is a vital problem that how an electromagnetic wave propagates in the region including multiple diffraction. Many electromagnetic wave propagation models are developed in order to map coverage and install base station in optimum number and power. S-UTD-CH model, which is an optimum models according to computation time and accuracy of prediction, can be used in coverage mapping. In this study, after giving some brief information about S-UTD-CH model, coverage map is generated by a sample scenario. Moreover, this model is compared with FEKO electromagnetic wave simulation software tool.	ch c/c++ interpreter;computation;feko;programming tool;simulation software;software propagation;time complexity;uniform theory of diffraction	Eray Arik;Mehmet Baris Tabakcioglu	2017	2017 25th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2017.7960146	simulation software;computer science;artificial intelligence;wave propagation;coverage map;computer vision;electromagnetic radiation;electronic engineering;simulation;software;diffraction;feko;solid modeling	Robotics	24.804920086761946	78.727283675254	199026

However, its coverage is greatly affected by rainfall. In this letter, we study the effects of rain attenuation on the radio channel in a heavy rainfall region for wideband signals in the 10-40-GHz frequency range. We conclude that although a lower frequency of <10 GHz is more affected by multipath due to a longer wavelength, it is still optimal in a heavy rainfall region due to high losses associated with higher frequency signals. In addition, for a path of over 1.5 km, the difference in horizontal and vertical polarization becomes significant.	access network;frequency band;multipath propagation;polarization (waves);rain fade;scalability;software deployment	Bernard Fong;Predrag B.
