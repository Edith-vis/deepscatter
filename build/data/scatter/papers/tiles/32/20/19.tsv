ceb37ad623d1812eb2b14ea03141836ca2b91334	the complexity of determining the vertex-rainbow index of graphs	k vertex rainbow index;computational complexity;vertex coloring;vertex rainbow s tree	The concept of the k-rainbow index of a network comes from the communication of information between agencies of government, which was introduced by Chartrand et al. in 2010. As a natural counterpart of the k-rainbow index, the concept of k-vertex-rainbow index was also introduced. For a graph G = (V,E) and a set S ⊆ V of at least two vertices, an S-Steiner tree or a Steiner tree connecting S (or simply, an S-tree) is such a subgraph T = (V′,E′) of G that is a tree with S ⊆ V′. For S ⊆ V (G) and |S|≥ 2, an S-Steiner tree T is said to be a vertex-rainbow S-tree if the vertices of V (T)∖S have distinct colors. For a fixed integer k with 2 ≤ k ≤ n, the vertex-coloring c of G is called a k-vertex-rainbow coloring if for every k-subset S of V (G) there exists a vertex-rainbow S-tree. In this case, G is called vertex-rainbow k-tree-connected. The minimum number of colors that are needed in a k-vertex-rainbow coloring of G is called the k-vertex-rainbow index of G, denoted by rvxk(G). In this paper, we study the complexity of determining the 3-vertex-rainbow index of a graph and prove that computing rvx3(G) is &#x1d4a9;&#x1d4ab;-Hard. Moreover, we show that it is &#x1d4a9;&#x1d4ab;-Complete to decide whether rvx3(G) = 3. We also prove that the following problem is &#x1d4a9;&#x1d4ab;-Complete: Given a vertex-colored graph G, check whether the given coloring makes G vertex-rainbow 3-tree-connected.

A family of subtrees of a graph is called 2-acyclic if the union of any two subtrees is acyclic. In the present paper we prove that every graph is an intersection graph of a Helly family of subtrees of a graph without triangles. In particular, we prove that a graph is an intersection graph of a Helly 2-acyclic family of subtrees of a graph iff it is neighborhood chordal, in which case we present a simple greedy algorithm to construct the corresponding family of subtrees. In addition, we describe polynomial-time recognition algorithms for the intersection graphs and for the perfect intersection graphs of Helly families of subtrees in cacti graphs.	tree (data structure)	Fanica Gavril	1996	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/0166-218X(94)00136-2	outerplanar graph;block graph;time complexity;pathwidth;split graph;combinatorics;clique graph;greedy algorithm;discrete mathematics;interval graph;topology;median graph;forbidden graph characterization;symmetric graph;mathematics;voltage graph;distance-hereditary graph;circle graph;intersection number;chordal graph;indifference graph;intersection graph;line graph;algorithm;string graph;planar graph;ordered graph	Theory	25.380410722049746	27.531356398030983	121855
25e8dd91bae5215f220e490c4e3c4b981d49e0ea	the number of dependent arcs in an acyclic orientation	chromatic number;acyclic orientation	Let G be a graph with n nodes, e edges, chromatic number and girth g. In an acyclic orientation of G, an arc is dependent if its reversal creates a cycle. It is well known that if < g, then G has an acyclic orientation without dependent arcs. Edelman showed that if G is connected, then every acyclic orientation has at most e ? n + 1 dependent arcs. We show that if G is connected and < g, then G has an acyclic orientation with exactly d dependent arcs for all d e ? n + 1. We also give bounds on the minimum number of dependent arcs in graphs with g. Given an acyclic orientation of a graph, Edelman (as quoted in West 6]) deened an arc to be dependent if its reversal creates a cycle. We consider the number of dependent arcs in an acyclic orientation of a graph. Given a graph G, let n(G) be the number of nodes, let e(G) be the number of edges, and let d max (G) be the maximum number of dependent arcs over all acyclic orientations of G.

Suppose one wants to prove that a random graph contains almost surely (a.s.) a subgraph S possessing two given properties, say A and B. Then, in the first step, one shows that a random graph contains a.s. at least one subgraph having the Property A. Next, it is shown that for a graph that contains any given subgraph S with Property A, this subgraph has also the Property B a.s. For the sake of simplicity let us denote the above method by M. It appears that this approach is not always accurate. In fact, some authors (see [3] and [6]) who had already used the method in their investigations, later expressed doubts about its correctness. For example, Moon (see [6]) who wanted to prove that almost all random graphs Kn,p, where p 2 = (1 + e)(2/n)lrZlogn, have a spanning cycle, confirms in his authorreferat as follows: """"It is shown that almost all such graphs contain at least one cycle of length n [(2n) v2] and it is shown that almost all graphs that contain any given cycle of this length also contain a spanning cycle. From this it iserroneously concluded that almost all graphs Kn,~, have a spanning cycle."""" Recently, it was shown (see [5]) that a stronger result about spanning cycles is even true. However the method of the proof is entirely different than that used by Moon. In a case of the paper [3] the authors have been able to show the correctness of method rig. This has become an inspiration for writing this note in which we specify those conditions under which the method M is correct. Several examples using the presented method will be analyzed."""	correctness (computer science);file spanning;random graph	Zbigniew Palka;Andrzej Rucinski;Joel H.

5c17277e5871322ae4a99b6fe9ce50312c044c2f	the median problem on k-partite graphs	networks;median;k partite;bipartite;distance	In a connected graph G, the status of a vertex is the sum of the distances of that vertex to each of the other vertices in G. The subgraph induced by the vertices of minimum (maximum) status in G is called the median (anti-median) of G. The median problem of graphs is closely related to the optimization problems involving the placement of network servers, the core of the entire networks. Bipartite graphs play a significant role in designing very large interconnection networks. In this paper, we answer a problem on the structure of medians of bipartite graphs by showing that any bipartite graph is the median (or anti-median) of another bipartite graph. Also, with a different construction, we show that the similar results hold for k-partite graphs, k ≥ 3. In addition, we provide constructions to embed another graph as center in both bipartite and k-partite cases. Since any graph is a k-partite graph, for some k, these constructions can be applied in general.	connectivity (graph theory);interconnection;mathematical optimization;server (computing);vertex (geometry)	Karuvachery Pravas;Ambat Vijayakumar	2015	Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory	10.7151/dmgt.1802	combinatorics;discrete mathematics	Theory	26.7379810097038	28.893871101838055	122356

The anti-Ramsey number was introduced by Erdős et al. (Infinite and finite sets, pp 657–665, 1973) and so far it has been determined for several special graph classes. Another related interesting problem posed by Erdős et al. is the uniqueness of the extremal coloring for the anti-Ramsey number. Contrary to the anti-Ramsey number, there are few results about the extremal coloring. In this paper, we show the uniqueness of such extremal coloring for the anti-Ramsey number of matchings in the complete graph.	graph coloring;matching (graph theory)	Zemin Jin;Yuefang Sun;Sherry H.

51adf38b63b1fbd4ac7d3333ed1b4a7acd95b3cc	cycle-cocycle partitions and faithful cycle covers for locally finite graphs		By a result of Gallai, every finite graph G has a vertex partition into two parts each inducing an element of its cycle space. This fails for infinite graphs if, as usual, the cycle space is defined as the span of the edge sets of finite cycles in G. However we show that, for the adaptation of the cycle space to infinite graphs recently introduced by Diestel and Kühn (which involves infinite cycles as well as finite ones), Gallai’s theorem extends to locally finite graphs. Using similar techniques we show that if Seymour’s faithful cycle cover conjecture is true for finite graphs then it also holds for locally finite graphs when infinite cyles are allowed in the cover, but not otherwise. We also consider extensions to graphs with infinite degrees.	cycle space;graph (discrete mathematics);vertex cycle cover	Henning Bruhn;Reinhard Diestel;Maya Jakobine Stein	2005	Journal of Graph Theory	10.1002/jgt.20101	strong perfect graph theorem;1-planar graph;pathwidth;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;robertson–seymour theorem;universal graph;topology;pancyclic graph;mathematics;maximal independent set;modular decomposition;chordal graph;indifference graph	Theory	30.753595751199253	28.303131962697165	122579

It is shown that an RBPD( v , 3,  λ ) exists if and only if  v  ≡ 9 (modulo 12/gcd(4, λ)). Moreover, the RBPD( v , 3,  λ ) can have an automorphism of order   v  3  . For  k  > 3, it is shown that if  v  is large enough, then an RBPD( v ,  k , 1) exists if and only if  v  ≡  k  2  (modulo lcm(2 k  − 2,  k )). Also, it is shown that the categorical product of a  k -factorable graph and a regular graph is also  k -factorable. These results are stronger than two conjectures of P. Hell and A.

e5d1c42917e11a00a5cefbcb559bd51159d33738	on facial unique-maximum (edge-)coloring		Abstract A facial unique-maximum coloring of a plane graph is a vertex coloring where on each face α the maximal color appears exactly once on the vertices of α . If the coloring is required to be proper, then the upper bound for the minimal number of colors required for such a coloring is set to 5. Fabrici and Goring (2016) even conjectured that 4 colors always suffice. Confirming the conjecture would hence give a considerable strengthening of the Four Color Theorem. In this paper, we prove that the conjecture holds for subcubic plane graphs, outerplane graphs and plane quadrangulations. Additionally, we consider the facial edge-coloring analogue of the aforementioned coloring and prove that every 2-connected plane graph admits such a coloring with at most 4 colors.	edge coloring	Vesna Andova;Bernard Lidický;Borut Luzar;Riste Skrekovski	2018	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2017.11.024	mathematics;combinatorics;conjecture;vertex (geometry);planar graph;edge coloring;four color theorem;upper and lower bounds;graph	Theory	29.04420886751745	26.386025099877642	123164

Combin. Theory Ser. B 65 (1995), 273-290) introduced the cover polynomial for a directed graph and showed that it was connected with classical rook theory. M. Dworkin (J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 71 (1997), 17-53) showed that the cover polynomial naturally factors for directed graphs associated with Ferrers boards. The authors (Adv. Appl. Math. 27 (2001), 438-481) developed a rook theory for shifted Ferrers boards where the analogue of a rook placement is replaced by a partial perfect matching of K2n, the complete graph on 2n vertices. In this paper, we show that an analogue of Dworkin’s result holds for shifted Ferrers boards in this setting. We also show how cycle-counting matching numbers are connected to cycle-counting “hit numbers” (which involve perfect matchings of K2n). Introduction Let B2n be the board pictured in Fig. 1. Let (i, j) denote the square in the i-th row and j-th column of B2n, so B2n = {(i, j) : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 2n}. Let K2n denote the complete graph on vertices {1, 2, . . . , 2n}. A perfect matching of K2n is a set of n edges of K2n where no two edges have a vertex in common. Given a perfect matching m of K2n, we let pm = {(i, j) : i < j and {i, j} ∈ m}. For example, if m = {{1, 4}, {2, 7}, {3, 5}, {6, 8}} is a perfect matching of K8, then pm is pictured in Fig. 2. For a given board B ⊆ B2n, we say that a subset p ⊆ B is a rook placement of B if there is a perfect matching m of K2n such that p ⊆ pm. We let Mk(B) denote the set of all k element perfect matchings of B and we call mk(B) = |Mk(B)| the k-th rook number of B. We let Fk,2n(B) = {pm : |pm ∩B| = k and m is a perfect matching of K2n}. We call fk,2n(B) = |Fk,2n(B)| the k-th hit number of B. Haglund and Remmel [HR] proved the following relationship between the hit numbers and the rook numbers of a board B ⊆ B2n. 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 05A05.	directed graph;dworkin's game driver;graham scan;matching (graph theory);mathematics subject classification;polynomial;vertex (geometry);xfig	James Haglund;Jeffrey B.

32b059487bf35061aadbec2fca0ce90e2ee7bf23	properly colored subgraphs and rainbow subgraphs in edge-colorings with local constraints	edge coloring;maximum degree;color appearance;complete graph	We consider a canonical Ramsey type problem. An edge-coloring of a graph is called m-good if each color appears at most m times at each vertex. Fixing a graph G and a positive integer m, let f(m,G) denote the smallest n such that every m-good edge-coloring of Kn yields a properly edgecolored copy of G, and let g(m,G) denote the smallest n such that every m-good edge-coloring of Kn yields a rainbow copy of G. We give bounds on f(m,G) and g(m,G). For complete graphs G = Kt, we have c1mt/ ln t ≤ f(m,Kt) ≤ c2mt, and c1mt/ ln t ≤ g(m,Kt) ≤ c2mt/ ln t, where c1, c2, c1, c ′ 2 are absolute constants. We also give bounds on f(m,G) and g(m,G) for general graphs G in terms of degrees in G. In particular, we show that for fixed m and d, and all sufficiently large n compared to m and d, f(m,G) = n for all graphs G with n vertices and maximum degree at most d.	edge coloring;graph coloring;rainbow table	Noga Alon;Tao Jiang;Zevi Miller;Dan Pritikin	2003	Random Struct.

If d(u)+d(v )≥n for every pair of nonadjacent vertices u and v , then G is hamiltonian.

We derive a O(ω3) upper bound for the chromatic number of (P3∪P2)-free graphs, and sharper bounds for (P3∪P2, diamond)-free graphs, where ω denotes the clique number. By applying similar proof techni ques we obtain chromatic bounds for(2K2, diamond)-free graphs.

A container C(u, v ) between u and v is a set of internally disjoint paths {P1, P2, . . . , Pw } between u and v where 1 ≤ w ≤ k . The width of C(u, v ) is w and the length of C(u, v ) {written as l [C(u, v )]} is max{l (Pi ) | 1 ≤ i ≤ w }. A w -container C(u, v ) is a container with width w . The w -wide distance between u and v , dw (u, v ), is min{l (C(u, v )) | C(u, v ) is a w -container}. A w -container C(u, v ) of the graph G is a w ∗-container if every node of G is incident with a path in C(u, v ). That means that the w -container C(u, v ) spans the whole graph. Let Sn be the n-dimensional star graph with n ≥ 5. It is known that Sn is bipartite. In this article, we show that, for any pair of distinct nodes u and v in different partite sets of Sn , there exists an (n − 1)∗-container C(u, v ) and the (n − 1)-wide distance d(n−1)(u, v ) is less than or equal to n! n−2 + 1.

A set   S⊆V   is a dominating set if every vertex of   V−S   is adjacent to some vertex in   S  . The domination number   γ(G)   of   G   is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set of   G  . A dominating set   D   is a least dominating set if   γ(〈D〉)⩽γ(〈S〉)   for any dominating set   S  , and   γ     l   (G)   is the minimum cardinality of a least dominating set. Sampathkumar (Discrete Math. 86 (1990) 137–142) conjectured that   γ     l   (G)⩽3n/5   for every connected graph on   n⩾2   vertices. This conjecture was proven by Favaron (Discrete Math. 150 (1996) 115–122). We shall characterise graphs   G   of order   n   that are edge-minimal with respect to satisfying   G   connected and   γ     l   (G)=3n/5  . Furthermore, we construct a family of graphs   G   of order   n   that are not cycles and are edge-minimal with respect to satisfying   G   connected,   δ(G)⩾2   and   γ     l   (G)=3n/5  .	dominating set	Michael A.

A set { f1, f2, . . . , fd} of Roman dominating functions on G with the property that ∑d i=1 fi(v) ≤ 2 for each v ∈ V (G) is called a Roman dominating family (of functions) on G. The maximum number of functions in a Roman dominating family on G is the Roman domatic number of G, denoted by dR(G). In this work we initiate the study of the Roman domatic number in graphs and we present some sharp bounds for dR(G). In addition, we determine the Roman domatic number of some graphs. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Clearly a necessary condition for a Hering connguration is n 1 (mod k). It is shown here that for any xed k, this condition is asymptotically suucient, and, it is shown to be always suucient for k = 4.	directed graph;emoticon;vertex (graph theory)	Andrew Granville;Hans-Dietrich O.

The Edge Reconstruction Conjecture asserts that every simple finite graph with four or more edges is determined uniquely, up to isomorphism, by its collection of edge-deleted subgraphs. A class of graphs is said to be edge reconstructible if there is no graph in the class w i th four or more edges that is not edge reconstructible. This paper proves that bidegreed graphs (graphs whose vertices all have one of two possible degrees) are edge reconstructible. The results are then generalized to show that all graphs that do not have three consecutive integers in their degree sequence are also edge reconstructible.	degree (graph theory);edge dominating set;graph (discrete mathematics);reconstruction conjecture	Wendy J.

Using order polynomials of partially ordered sets, we establish a reciprocity theorem for weak chromatic polynomials giving interpretations of evaluations at negative integers.	chromatic polynomial;color;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;mixed graph	Matthias Beck;Daniel Blado;Joseph Crawford;Taïna Jean-Louis;Michael Young	2015	Graphs and Combinatorics	10.1007/s00373-013-1381-1	partially ordered set;gallai–hasse–roy–vitaver theorem;graph power;chromatic polynomial;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;fractional coloring;graph property;perfect graph;gray graph;mixed graph;edge coloring;moser spindle;foster graph;cycle graph;graph coloring;mathematics;windmill graph;wheel graph;butterfly graph;graph minor;bound graph;coxeter graph;friendship graph	Theory	28.713451963990465	26.34300686930062	126431

Applying the strategy, we obtain the following four algorithms. The first one lists all the triangles in a graph G in O(a(G)m) time, where m is the number of edges of G and a(G) the arboricity of G. The second finds all the quadrangles in O(a(G)m) time. Since a(G) is at most three for a planar graph G, both run in linear time for a planar graph. The third lists all the complete subgraphs K of order in O(la(G)t-2m) time. The fourth lists all the cliques in O(a(G)m) time per clique. All the algorithms require linear space. We also establish an upper bound on a(G) for a graph G: a(G) <[(2m+ n)1/2/2], where n is the number of vertices in G.

Recently, the notion of homomorphism of signed graphs has been introduced since this notion captures a number of well known conjectures which can be reformulated using the definitions of signed homomorphism. In this paper, we introduce and study the properties of some target graphs for signed homomorphism. Using these properties, we obtain upper bounds on the signed chromatic numbers of graphs with bounded acyclic chromatic number and of signed planar graphs with given girth.	acyclic coloring;antivirus software;central processing unit;delaunay triangulation;directed acyclic graph;existential quantification;girth (graph theory);graph coloring;planar graph;rudolf m. tromp;signed graph;vertex (geometry)	Pascal Ochem;Alexandre Pinlou;Sagnik Sen	2014	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;chordal graph;indifference graph;algebra	Theory	27.764945642529433	27.001582081857485	127159

The k-th chromatic number of G, denoted by χk(G), is the smallest x such that G admits a k-fold x-coloring. We present an ILP formulation to determine χk(G) and study the facial structure of the corresponding polytope Pk(G). We show facets that Pk+1(G) inherits from Pk(G). We also relate Pk(G) to P1(G◦Kk), whereG◦Kk is the lexicographic product ofG by a clique with k vertices. In both cases, we can obtain facet-defining inequalities from most of those known for the 1-fold coloring polytope. In addition, we present a class of facet-defining inequalities based on strongly χk-critical webs, which extend and generalize known corresponding results for 1-fold coloring. We introduce this criticality concept and characerize the webs having such a property.	clique (graph theory);color;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;lexicographical order;neighbourhood (graph theory);self-organized criticality	Manoel B.

Let Ω be the family of all graphs G such that every star-factor of G has the same weights under a fixed edge-weighting w. In this paper, we present a simple structural characterization of the graphs in Ω that have girth at least five.	a* search algorithm;file spanning;girth (graph theory);graph (discrete mathematics)	Yunjian Wu;Qinglin Yu	2014	Ars Comb.		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics	Theory	29.483070003927246	29.83293297493027	130162

S is called an acyclic dominating set of G if it is both acyclic and dominating. The minimum cardinality of an acyclic dominating set, denoted by γa(G), is called the acyclic domination number of G. Hedetniemi et al. in [5] introduced the concept of acyclic domination and posed the following open problem: If δ(G) is the minimum degree of G, is γa(G) ≤ δ(G) for any graph whose diameter is two? In this paper, we provide a negative answer to this question by showing that for any positive k, there is a graph G with diameter two such that γa(G)− δ(G) ≥ k.	directed acyclic graph;dominating set;graph (discrete mathematics);vertex (graph theory)	T.

Fourier, LSD2-/MAG, BP 53, 3804/ Grenoble Cedex 9, France Received 22 November 1995 Communicated by C. Benzaken We give an analogue of Haj6s's theorem for the list-chromatic number, emphasizing the role of complete bipartite graphs. We consider only finite, undirected graphs, without loops. Given a graph G = (V, E), a k-coloring of the vertices of G is a mapping c: V ~ {I, 2, ... , k} such that for every edge xy of G we have c(x) =Ic(y). The graph G is called k-colorable if it admits a k-coloring, and the chromatic number of G is the smallest integer k such that G is k-colorable. Vizing [4], as well as Erdos et al. [1] introduced a variant of the coloring problem as follows. Suppose that each vertex v is assigned a list L(v) of possible colors; we then want to find a vertex-coloring c such that c(v) E L(v) for all v E V. In the case where such a c exists we will say that the graph Gis L-colorable; we may also say that c is an L-coloring of G. Given an integer k, the graph G is called k-choosable if it is L-colorable for every assignment L that satisfies IL(v)1 ~ k for all v E V. Finally, the choice number or list-chromatic number Ch(G) of G is the smallest k such that G is k-choosable. Rajas [2] proved a classic theorem on the chromatic number of a graph. Rere we give the analogue for the choice number. Rajas proposed a transformation of graphs based on three operations, with which all graphs that are not q-colorable can be built from the complete graph on q + 1 vertices. Call r;q the class of all graphs that are not q-colorable. This class r;q is closed under the three following operations, defined by Rajas. (1) Add vertices or edges. (2) Let Gb Gl be two vertex-disjoint graphs, and alb l and albl be edges in Gl and Gl , respectively.

Du, Hsu and Hwang conjectured that every such graph has independence number n. The conjecture was later strengthened by Erdős claiming that every cycle-plus-triangles graph has a 3-colouring, which was verified by Fleischner and Stiebitz using the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. An elementary proof was later given by Sachs. However, these proofs are non-algorithmic and the complexity of finding a proper 3-colouring is left open. As a first step toward an algorithm, we show that it can be decided in polynomial time whether a graph is a cycle-plus-triangles graph. Our algorithm is based on revealing structural properties of cycle-plus-triangles graphs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Motivated by a result from additive number theory, Hegarty raised the question of how many new edges G has when G is a regular, connected graph with diameter at least r. We address this question for r = 3, 6. We give a lower bound for the number of edges in the rth power of G in terms of the order of G and the minimal degree of G. As a corollary, for r = 3, 6, we determine how small the ratio e(G)/e(G) can be for regular, connected graphs of diameter at least r.	connectivity (graph theory);utility functions on indivisible goods;vertex (graph theory)	Alexey Pokrovskiy	2014	Australasian J.

Neil Robertson asked to what extent triangulations are characterized by this property, and conjectured an answer. In this paper we prove his conjecture, that if G is simple and 3-connected and every circuit of length ≥ 4 has at least two “bridges,” then G may be built up by “clique-sums” starting from complete graphs and planar triangulations.

0aa077e9f9764f5e2030a2885878f82c2ed29e3f	a new proof of menger's theorem		A new proof of Menger's theorem is presented. The purpose of this note is to give a new proof of a classical theorem of Menger [8], which has as corollaries theorems of Hall [5], Konig [7] and Dilworth [2]. Variations of Dirac's proof [ 3 ] appear in [6] and [l], and another proof is sketched in [lo]. A proof based on the max-flow, min-cut theorem appears in [4], and two recent proofs appear in [9]. Terminology here follows that of [l] and [6] . Theorem. Let u and u be distinct, non-adjacent vertices of a graph G. Then, the maximum number of disjoint u-u paths in G equals the minimum number of vertices in a u-u separating set. Proof. Note first that the minimum number of'vertices in a u-u separating set is at least as large as the maximum number of disjoint u-u paths. Now perform a complete induction on the number of edges. If G has two edges, the result is obvious. Suppose then that the theorem holds for graphs on k < n edges, where n 3 2, and that G has n + 1 edges. Let rn be the maximum number of disjoint u-u paths in G, and consider three cases. Case 1. There are disjoint u-u paths PI, . . . , P,,, in G, and an edge xy of G with no vertex on any P,.

Namely, we are interested in the extremal values of these ratios for acyclic and cyclic graphs with given maximal degree. The values of infinum and supremum for graphs with given maximal degree are obtained. Also, the infinum of these ratios for trees with given maximal degree are obtained. Suprema for trees of given maximal degree are given when ratios of paths of length 1 and 2 are observed, and when ratios of paths of lengths 1 and 3 are observed. As the main result, a linear algorithm (in terms of maximal degree) for finding suprema of the ratios of the numbers of paths of length 2 and 3 for trees with given maximal degree is presented.

839bc61272fbb9a2c357758517e6df69e4cdc5a4	domination critical semigraphs	dominating set;domination number	Abstract   Sampathkumar [1] introduced a new type of generalization to graphs, called Semigraphs. A semigraph  G  = ( V ,  X ) on the set of vertices  V  and the set of edges  X  consists of n-tuples (u 1 ,u 2 ,u n ) of distinct elements belonging to the set  V  for various  n  ≥ 2, with the following conditions : (1) Any n-tuple ( u  1 , u  2 , u   n  ) = ( u   n  , u   n -1 ,…, u  1 ) and (2) Any two such tuples have at most one element in common.  S. S. Kamath and R. S. Bhat [3] introduced domination in semigraphs. Two vertices  u  and  v  are said to a-dominate each other if they are adjacent. A set  D  ⊆  V(G)  is an adjacent dominating set (ad-set) if every vertex in  V - D  is adjacent to a vertex in  D.  The minimum cardinality of an ad-set  D  is called adjacency domination number of  G  and is denoted by γ a.   γ a (G) may increase or decrease by the removal of a vertex or an edge from  G.   A vertex  v  of a semigraph  G  is said to be γ a  - critical if γ a ( G - v ) ≠ γ a  (G);  if  γ   a  ( G  -  v ) =  γ   a  ( G ), then  v  is γ a  - redundatnt. The main objective of this paper is to study this phenomenon on the vertices and edges of a semigraph.	dominating set	S. S. Kamath;Saroja R.

f03930de4826481a3442f89e26fcad117ff32ab5	on the number of cliques in graphs with a forbidden minor		Reed and Wood and independently Norine, Seymour, Thomas, and Wollan proved that for each positive integer t there is a constant c(t) such that every graph on n vertices with no Kt-minor has at most c(t)n cliques. Wood asked in 2007 if we can take c(t) = c for some absolute constant c. This question was recently answered affirmatively by Lee and Oum. In this paper, we determine the exponential constant. We prove that every graph on n vertices with noKt-minor has at most 3 n cliques. This bound is tight for n ≥ 4t/3. More generally, let H be a connected graph on t vertices, and x denote the size (i.e., the number edges) of the largest matching in the complement of H . We prove that every graph on n vertices with no H-minor has at most max(3n, 2n) cliques, and this bound is tight for n ≥ max(4t/3− 2x/3, t) by a simple construction. Even more generally, we determine explicitly the exponential constant for the maximum number of cliques an n-vertex graph can have in a minor-closed family of graphs which is closed under disjoint union.	clique (graph theory);connectivity (graph theory);forbidden graph characterization;time complexity;tridiagonal matrix algorithm;vertex (geometry)	Jacob Fox;Fan Wei	2017	J.

In other words, if these two vertices are removed, the remaining graph has a Hamilton cycle.

We prove that the Erdős-Posa property holds for chordless cycles, which resolves the major open question concerning the Erdős-Posa property. Our proof for chordless cycles is constructive: in polynomial time, one can find either k + 1 vertex-disjoint chordless cycles, or ck 2 log k vertices hitting every chordless cycle for some constant c. It immediately implies an approximation algorithm of factor O(opt log opt) for C hordal V ertex D eletion . We complement our main result by showing that chordless cycles of length at least e for any fixed e ≥ 5 do not have the Erdős-Posa property. As a corollary, for a non-negative integral function w defined on the vertex set of a graph G , the minimum value Σ w ( x ) over all vertex sets S hitting all cycles of G is at most O( k 2 log k ) where k is the maximum number of cycles (not necessarily vertex-disjoint) in G such that each vertex v is used at most w ( v ) times.	erdős number;erdős–pósa theorem	Eun Jung Kim;O-joung Kwon	2018		10.1137/1.9781611975031.109	induced subgraph;corollary;time complexity;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;vertex (geometry);approximation algorithm;mathematics;graph	Crypto	31.539020539214803	28.203530391134684	134397

A labelling can be used to define a weight for each edge and for each vertex of finite degree. A labelling is edge-magic if all the edges have the same weight and vertex-magic if all the vertices are finite degree and have the same weight. We exhibit magic labellings for various countable graphs. For countably infinite stars, countable galaxies and forests, and for an arbitrary abelian group, we determine when there is an edge-magic labelling and what group elements occur as constants. In the particular case where the group is the integers, we determine when there is an vertex-magic labelling, and which integers occur as constants. We also give explicit edge-magic labellings of various frieze graphs over the integers. AMS subject classification: 05C78	graph labeling;vhdl-ams;vertex (geometry)	Diana Combe;Adrian M.

5edd81c3cd795cdb21fc5f9357f3fb3f438debf0	a new characterization of strongly chordal graphs	strongly chordal graph;chordal graph	The ‘strength’ of an edge or cycle is the number of maximal complete subgraphs it is in. Strongly chordal graphs are characterized by every cycle of edges of strengths at least k with no chord of strength at least k always itself having strength at least k. Among hereditary clique-Helly graphs, this is equivalent to the subgraph of edges of strength at least k always forming a chordal graph. c © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. A graph is de ned in [1] to be strongly chordal if it is chordal — every induced cycle is a triangle — and every cycle C of even length at least six has a chord that joins two vertices u and v whose distance apart in C is odd and greater than one. A graph is a trampoline if it is formed from a cycle x1; y1; x2; : : : ; x‘; y‘; x1 of even length at least six by adding all possible xixj edges. The following is among the many known characterizations of strongly chordal graphs (many of which are surveyed in [2]). Lemma 1 (Farber [1]). A graph is strongly chordal if and only if it is chordal and contains no induced trampoline. De ne the strength of an edge or a set of edges to be the number of maxcliques — inclusion-maximal complete subgraphs — that contain it. This notion of strength allows a characterization of strongly chordal graph that is strikingly like the standard characterization of chordal graph, reworded as follows: A graph is chordal if and only if every cycle of edges of strengths at least one with no chord of strength at least one itself has strength at least one.

All rights reserved. PII: S0012 -365X(99)00107 -7 246 T.A. McKee /Discrete Mathematics 205 (1999) 245–247 Theorem 1. A graph is strongly chordal if and only if; for every k¿1; every cycle of edges of strengths at least k with no chord of strength at least k itself has strength at least k. Proof. First suppose G is not strongly chordal. By Lemma 1, either G contains an induced cycle of length at least four or G contains an induced trampoline. In the former case, that induced cycle is a cycle of edges of strengths at least 1 with no chord of strength at least 1 that itself has strength zero. So suppose G contains an induced trampoline x1; y1; x2; : : : ; x‘; y‘; x1 where the cycle C : x1; x2; : : : ; x‘; x1 induces a complete graph of strength h¿1 in G. We also assume minimality in that no subset of {x1; : : : ; x‘} is part of a smaller trampoline. Since each edge xixi+1 along C, calculating subscripts modulo ‘, is contained (with yi) in at least one additional maxclique of G; C is cycle of edges of strengths at least h + 1 that only has strength h; there are no chords of strength at least h+ 1 by the assumed minimality. Conversely, suppose G is strongly chordal. We argue by induction on k, with the k = 1 case automatic because G is chordal. Suppose C: x1; x2; : : : ; x‘; x1 is a cycle of edges of strengths at least k¿2, with no chord of strength at least k, and C has strength h with 06h¡k (arguing toward a contradiction). Suppose for a moment that the maximum strength h′ of a chord xixj of C were such that h¡h′¡k. Then such chords taken together with C would form smaller cycles of edges of strengths at least h′ with no chords of strength at least h′. By the inductive hypothesis, each of these smaller cycles would be in at least h′ maxcliques, yet these smaller cycles cannot all be in the same h′ maxcliques since that would force C to be in h′ maxcliques (contradicting h¡h′). But this would make the strength of at least one such edge xixj be greater than h′ (contradicting the de nition of h′). Therefore each chord xixj of C has strength exactly h. Since each edge xixi+1 of C has strength at least k, we can pick a vertex yi not on C for each i6‘ such that xi; yi; xi+1 are in a common maxclique that does not contain all of C; indeed, since C has strength h and each of its chords has strength only h; N (yi) ∩ V (C) = {xixi+1}. Notice too that none of the yi’s can be adjacent without forming an induced C4, contrary to G being chordal. Therefore either h¿ 0 and the xi’s and yi’s induce a trampoline, or h=0 and C is an induced cycle of length greater than three; either would contradict Lemma 1. Notice that the characterization of strongly chordal in Theorem 1 requires more than merely saying that, for every k, the edges of strength at least k form a chordal graph. In the the six-vertex trampoline for instance, the edges of strength at least two form a triangle that only has strength one. A graph G is de ned in [3] to be hereditary clique-Helly if, for every induced subgraph G′ of G, the set of all maxcliques of G′ satis es the Helly condition (if every two of the maxcliques have a vertex in common, then all the maxcliques have a vertex in common); this is also equivalent to every induced subgraph being ‘maximal clique irreducible’ in the sense of [4]. Prisner [3] shows that every strongly chordal graph is T.A. McKee /Discrete Mathematics 205 (1999) 245–247 247 hereditary clique-Helly. The following is among the several known characterizations of hereditary clique-Helly graphs (see, for instance, [2]). Lemma 2 (Prisner [3]). A graph is hereditary clique-Helly if and only if; for every triangle v1v2v3; one of its edges vivj is such that every common neighbor of vi and vj is in the closed neighborhood of the third vertex. Theorem 2. A graph G is hereditary clique-Helly if and only if; for every k¿1; every triangle of edges of strengths at least k itself has strength at least k. Proof. First suppose G is hereditary clique-Helly and v1v2v3 is any triangle of edges of strengths at least k. By Lemma 2, we can suppose without loss of generality that every common neighbor of v1 and v2 is in the closed neighborhood of v3, and so that v1v2v3 has strength at least k. Conversely, suppose for every k that every triangle of edges of strengths at least k has strength at least k and suppose v1v2v3 is a triangle of strength k. Thus some edge vivj of the triangle must have strength exactly k. But this forces every common neighbor of vi and vj to also be in the closed neighborhood of the third vertex. Thus the graph is hereditary clique-Helly by Lemma 2. Theorems 1 and 2 combine to give the following. Corollary 3. A hereditary clique-Helly graph is strongly chordal if and only if; for every k; the edges of strengths at least k form a chordal graph.	clique (graph theory);cuthill–mckee algorithm;cycle (graph theory);discrete mathematics;h+: the digital series;hereditary property;induced path;induced subgraph;mathematical induction;maximal set;modulo operation;personally identifiable information	Terry A.

283029cc3445def2e159b9719e5c2846bc3e390a	a generalised upper bound for the k-tuple domination number	nombre domination;domination;moyenne;upper bound;numero dominacion;promedio;graph;68r10;average;domination number;borne superieure;cota superior	In this paper, we provide an upper bound for the k-tuple domination number that generalises known upper bounds for the double and triple domination numbers. We prove that for any graph G, γ×k(G) ≤ ln(δ − k + 2) + ln (∑k−1 m=1(k −m)d̂m + ) + 1 δ − k + 2 n, where γ×k(G) is the k-tuple domination number; δ is the minimal degree; d̂m is the m-degree of G; = 1 if k = 1 or 2 and = −d if k ≥ 3; d is the average degree. We consider finite and undirected graphs without loops and multiple edges. If G is a graph, then V (G) = {v1, v2, ..., vn} is the set of vertices in G, di denotes the degree of vi and d = ( ∑n i=1 di)/n is the average degree of G. Let N(x) denote the neighbourhood of a vertex x. Also let N(X) = ∪x∈XN(x) and N [X] = N(X) ∪ X, where X is a vertex set of G. Denote by δ(G) the minimal vertex degree of G, and put δ = δ(G). A set X ⊆ V (G) is called a dominating set if every vertex not in X is adjacent to a vertex in X. The minimum cardinality of a dominating set of G is the domination 1 number γ(G). A set X is called a k-tuple dominating set of G if for every vertex v ∈ V (G), |N [v] ∩ X| ≥ k. The minimum cardinality of a k-tuple dominating set of G is the k-tuple domination number γ×k(G). It is easy to see that the k-tuple domination number is only defined for graphs with δ ≥ k − 1. Also, γ(G) = γ×1(G) and γ×k(G) ≤ γ×k′(G) for k ≤ k′. The 2-tuple domination number γ×2(G) and the 3-tuple domination number γ×3(G) are called the double domination number and the triple domination number, respectively. A number of interesting results on the k-tuple domination number can be found in [3]–[9] and [11]. Alon and Spencer [1], Arnautov [2] and Payan [10] independently proved the following fundamental result: Theorem 1 ([1, 2, 10]) For any graph G, γ(G) ≤ ln(δ + 1) + 1 δ + 1 n. Harant and Henning [3] found an upper bound for the double domination number: Theorem 2 ([3]) For any graph G with δ ≥ 1, γ×2(G) ≤ ln δ + ln(d + 1) + 1 δ n. An interesting upper bound for the triple domination number was given by Rautenbach and Volkmann [11]: Theorem 3 ([11]) For any graph G with δ ≥ 2, γ×3(G) ≤ ln(δ − 1) + ln(d + d̂2) + 1 δ − 1 n, where d̂2 = 1 n ∑n i=1 ( di 2 ) . The following theorem generalises this bound for the k-tuple domination number. For m ≤ δ, let us define the m-degree d̂m of a graph G as follows: d̂m = d̂m(G) = 1 n n ∑	dominating set	Andrei V.

The open neighbourhood N(v) of v is the set of all vertices adjacent with v in G, while the closed neighbourhood of v is N(v) U {v}. A packing of a graph G is a set of vertices whose closed neighbourhoods are pairwise disjoint. Equivalently, a packing of a graph G is a set of vertices whose elements are pairwise at distance at least 3 apart in G. The lower packing number of G, denoted pL(G), is the minimum cardinality of a maximal packing of G while the (upper) packing number of G, denoted p(G), is the maximum cardinality among all packings of G. An open packing of G is a set of vertices whose open neighbourhoods are pairwise disjoint. The lower open packing number of G, denoted p~(G), is the minimum cardinality of a maximal open packing of G while the (upper) open packing number of G, denoted p°(G), is the maximum cardinality among all open packings of G. We present upper bounds on the packing number and the lower packing number of a tree. Bounds relating the packing numbers and open packing numbers of a tree are established.

The noncrossing graph NCn is the graph whose vertex set is the set of nonempty subsets of [n] = {1, . . . , n} with an edge between any two non-crossing sets. Various facts, some new and some already known, concerning the chromatic number, fractional chromatic number, independence number, clique number and clique cover number of this graph are presented. For the chromatic number of this graph we show: n(loge n − Θ(1)) ≤ χ(NCn) ≤ n(dlog2 ne − 1).	clique (graph theory);clique cover;fractional coloring;graph coloring;independent set (graph theory);ne (complexity);vertex (graph theory)	Nathan Linial;Michael E.

a633d31d28f9b6769cefdfedae2078e6bc352da5	ramsey goodness of bounded degree trees		Given a pair of graphs G and H, the Ramsey number R(G,H) is the smallest N such that every red-blue coloring of the edges of the complete graph KN contains a red copy of G or a blue copy of H. If a graph G is connected, it is well known and easy to show that R(G,H) ≥ (|G| − 1)(χ(H) − 1) + σ(H), where χ(H) is the chromatic number of H and σ(H) is the size of the smallest color class in a χ(H)-coloring of H. A graph G is called H-good if R(G,H) = (|G| − 1)(χ(H) − 1) + σ(H). The notion of Ramsey goodness was introduced by Burr and Erdős in 1983 and has been extensively studied since then. In this paper we show that if n ≥ Ω(|H| log |H|) then every n-vertex bounded degree tree T is H-good. The dependency between n and |H| is tight up to log factors. This substantially improves a result of Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp from 1985, who proved that n-vertex bounded degree trees are H-good when n ≥ Ω(|H|).

An appropriate model for representing such structures is the so called random signed graphs Gn,p,q defined as follows. Given a set of n vertices and fixed numbers p and q, 0 < p+ q < 1, then, between each pair of vertices, there exists either a positive edge with probability p, or a negative edge with probability q, or there is no edge with probability 1− p− q. We first show that, almost always (i.e. with probability tending to 1 as n −→ ∞), the random signed graph Gn,p,q is unbalanced. Subsequently we estimate the maximum order of a balanced induced subgraph in Gn,p,p, and show that its order achieves only a finite number of values. Next, we study the asymptotic behavior of the degree of balance and give upper and lower bounds for the line-index of balance. Finally, we study the threshold function of balance, e.g., a function p0(n) such that if p ≫ p0(n), then almost always the random signed graph Gn,p,p is unbalanced, else it is almost always balanced.	frank harary;goldner–harary graph;induced subgraph;signed graph;social structure;unbalanced circuit;vertex (geometry)	Abdelhakim El Maftouhi;Yannis Manoussakis;O.

If minor prohibition is limited to subgraphs induced by simple paths instead of circuits, then for certain forbidden configurations, we reach tight estimates. A graph whose simple paths induce K3,3-minor free graphs is proven to be 6-colorable; K5 is such a graph. Consequently, a graph whose simple paths induce planar graphs is 6-colorable. We suspect the latter to be 5-colorable and we are not aware of such 5chromatic graphs. Alternatively, (and with more accuracy) a graph whose simple paths induce {K5, K 3,3}-minor free graphs is proven to be 4-colorable (where K − 3,3 is the graph obtained from K3,3 by removing a single edge); K4 is such a graph. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The rainbow connection number of a graph is the minimum number of colours needed to make the graph rainbow-connected. This graph parameter was introduced by G. Chartrand, G.L. Johns, K.A. McKeon and P. Zhang in 2008. Since, the topic drew much attention, and various similar parameters were introduced, all dealing with undirected graphs. Here, we initiate the study of rainbow connection in oriented graphs. An early statement is that the rainbow connection number of an oriented graph is lower bounded by its diameter and upper bounded by its order. We first characterize oriented graphs having rainbow connection number equal to their order. We then consider tournaments and prove that (i) the rainbow connection number of a tournament can take any value from 2 to its order minus one, and (ii) the rainbow connection number of every tournament with diameter d is at most d + 2.	color;graph (discrete mathematics);orientation (graph theory)	Paul Dorbec;Ingo Schiermeyer;Elzbieta Sidorowicz;Éric Sopena	2014	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2014.07.018	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	30.019492962444765	27.524350654193313	139265

This result generalises the theorem that any two edges in a matching covered graph with at least four vertices belong to an alternating circuit.	balanced circuit;ear decomposition;whole earth 'lectronic link	Marcelo H. de Carvalho;Charles H.

We extend Whitney’s Theorem by allowing some separating triangles. More precisely we define a tree B whose vertices are the separating triangles of the given maximal planar graph G and we show that if each vertex of the tree B has at most 2 children, then G is hamiltonian for any two boundary edges. Furthermore, it is shown that the conclusion of Whitney’s Theorem still holds if there are exactly three separating triangles.	bell's theorem;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);maximal set;planar graph	Guido Helde;Oliver Vieten	2006	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2006.06.092	hamiltonian path;outerplanar graph;graph power;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;polyhedral graph;topology;nested triangles graph;forbidden graph characterization;cycle graph;planar straight-line graph;mathematics;butterfly graph;graph minor;line graph;planar graph	Theory	29.274269233396677	28.671158121278022	139869

In a multiple interval representation of a graph, each vertex is associated to at least one interval of the real line, with an edge between two vertices if and only if an interval associated to one vertex has a nonempty intersection with an interval associated to the other vertex. A graph on n vertices is a k-gap interval graph if it has a multiple interval representation with at most n + k intervals in total. In order to scale up the nice algorithmic properties of interval graphs (where k = 0), we parameterize graph problems by k, and find FPT algorithms for several problems, including Feedback Vertex Set, Dominating Set, Independent Set, Clique, Clique Cover, and Multiple Interval Transversal. The Coloring problem turns out to be W[1]-hard and we design an XP algorithm for the recognition problem.	algorithm;clique cover;dominating set;feedback vertex set;independent set (graph theory);parameterized complexity;vertex (geometry)	Fedor V.

We say that such graphs are (evenhole, diamond)-free. For this class of graphs we first obtain a decomposition theorem, using clique cutsets, bisimplicial cutsets (which is a special type of a star cutset) and 2-joins. This decomposition theorem is then used to prove that every graph that is (evenhole, diamond)-free contains a simplicial extreme (i.e., a vertex that is either of degree 2 or whose neighborhood induces a clique). This characterization implies that for every (evenhole, diamond)-free graph G, χ(G) ≤ ω(G) + 1 (where χ denotes the chromatic number and ω the size of a largest clique). In other words, the class of (even-hole, diamond)-free graphs is a χ-bounded family of graphs with the Vizing bound for the chromatic number. The existence of simplicial extremes also shows that (even-hole, diamond)-free graphs are β-perfect, which implies a polynomial time coloring algorithm, by coloring greedily on a particular, easily constructable, ordering of vertices. Note that the class of (even-hole, diamond)-free graphs can also be recognized in polynomial time.	a* search algorithm;cut (graph theory);graph coloring;greedy algorithm;kleene star;time complexity;vadim g. vizing	Ton Kloks;Haiko Müller;Kristina Vuskovic	2009	J.

96f5f641f40bfd9fcebaf7383e46e29610d0b1c7	on the hyperbolicity of bipartite graphs and intersection graphs	clique graph;biclique graph;gromov hyperbolicity;line graph;intersection graph;bipartite graph;graph power	Hyperbolicity is a measure of the tree-likeness of a graph from a metric perspective. Recently, it has been used to classify complex networks depending on their underlying geometry. Motivated by a better understanding of the structure of graphs with bounded hyperbolicity, we here investigate on the hyperbolicity of bipartite graphs. More precisely, given a bipartite graph B = (V0 ∪V1, E)we prove it is enough to consider any one side Vi of the bipartition of B to obtain a close approximate of its hyperbolicity δ(B) — up to an additive constant 2.We obtain from this result the sharp bounds δ(G)−1 ≤ δ(L(G)) ≤ δ(G)+1 and δ(G)−1 ≤ δ(K(G)) ≤ δ(G)+1 for every graphG, with L(G) andK(G) being respectively the line graph and the clique graph of G. Finally, promising extensions of our techniques to a broader class of intersection graphs are discussed and illustrated with the case of the biclique graph BK(G), for which we prove (δ(G) − 3)/2 ≤ δ(BK(G)) ≤ (δ(G) + 3)/2. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We determine the circular ow number of some regular multigraphs. In particular, we characterize the bipartite (2t + 1)-regular graphs (t 1). Our results imply that there are gaps for possible circular ow numbers for (2t + 1)-regular graphs, e.g. there is no cubic graph G with 3 < F c (G) < 4. We further show that there are snarks with circular ow number arbitrary close to 4, answering a question of X.

We prove that every triangle-free planar graph admits an (F , F5)-partition.

This paper studies stratified domination from an algorithmic point of view. A 2-stratified (or black-white) graph is a graph in which every vertex is colored black or white. Given a black-white graph F rooted at a white vertex v, an F-coloring of a graph G=(V,E) is a black-white coloring of V for which every white vertex v of G belongs to a copy of F (not necessarily induced in G) rooted at v. An F-dominating set of G is the set of all black vertices in an F-coloring. The F-domination number @c""""F(G) of G is the minimum cardinality of an F-dominating set. We consider the 3-vertex black-white graph F""""3 rooted at a white vertex v adjacent to another white vertex u, which adjacent to a black vertex w.

Colorful paths in vertex coloring of graphs. Preprint] that, if G is a connected graph distinct from C7, then there is a χ(G)-coloring of G in which every vertex v ∈ V (G) is an initial vertex of a path P with χ(G) vertices whose colors are different. In [S. Akbari, V. Liaghat, and A. Nikzad. Colorful paths in vertex coloring of graphs. Electron. J. Combin. 18(1):P17, 9pp, 2011] this was proved with ⌊ 2 ⌋ vertices instead of χ(G) vertices. We strengthen this to χ(G) − 1 vertices. We also prove that every connected graph with at least one edge has a proper k-coloring (for some k) such that every vertex of color i has a neighbor of color i + 1 (mod k). C5 shows that k may have to be greater than the chromatic number. However, if the graph is connected, infinite and locally finite, and has finite chromatic number, then the k-coloring exists for every k ≥ χ(G). In fact, the k-coloring can be chosen such that every vertex is a starting vertex of an infinite path such that the color increases by 1 (mod k) along each edge. The method is based on the circular chromatic number χc(G). In particular, we verify the above conjecture for all connected graphs whose circular chromatic number equals the chromatic number.	color;connectivity (graph theory);electron;graph coloring;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Meysam Alishahi;Ali Taherkhani;Carsten Thomassen	2011	Electr.

The paired domination number of G, denoted by ? pr (G), is the minimum cardinality of a paired dominating set of G. A graph with no isolated vertex is called paired domination vertex critical, or briefly ? pr -critical, if for any vertex v of G that is not adjacent to any vertex of degree one, ? pr (G?v)<? pr (G). A ? pr -critical graph G is said to be k-? pr -critical if ? pr (G)=k. In this paper, we firstly show that every 4-? pr -critical graph of even order has a perfect matching if it is K 1,5-free and every 4-? pr -critical graph of odd order is factor-critical if it is K 1,5-free. Secondly, we show that every 6-? pr -critical graph of even order has a perfect matching if it is K 1,4-free.	dominating set;matching (graph theory)	Shenwei Huang;Erfang Shan;Liying Kang	2012	J.

When (X, r) is not a tree most authors form an c quivalent tree (V’, 7i.), which is “grown” from a stuting vertex according to tk mapping r except that a vertex is never identified with a vertex already added to the tree (cf. fa. 2~). Trees have the aMntages of possessing a simple structure and of allowing the c asy application of backing-up rules such as the m nimax rule (2 ] . However in some situations it is be1 ter to retain the more cumpact model (X, I’). For exltmple, for the games i!hutrated in figs. 1 a, b it is easi iy seen, by using minimax-l&e arguments, that the test move for the openplayer is S + b, and there is no gain associated trees (Q, ‘i.)

It is known that every graph has an odd dominating set. In this paper we consider the concept of connected odd dominating sets. We prove that the problem of deciding if a graph has a connected odd dominating set is NP-complete. We also determine the existence or non-existence of such sets in several classes of graphs. Among other results, we prove there are only 15 grid graphs that have a connected odd dominating set.	edge dominating set;graph (discrete mathematics);modulo operation;np-completeness;vertex (geometry)	Yair Caro;William Klostermeyer;Raphael Yuster	2005	Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory	10.7151/dmgt.1276	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;dominating set;connected dominating set	Theory	26.523669264831685	27.397131283029022	144333

A matching covered graph G is extremal if the number of perfect matchings of G is equal to the dimension of the lattice spanned by the set of incidence vectors of perfect matchings of G. We first establish several basic properties of extremal matching covered graphs. In particular, we show that every extremal brick may be obtained by splicing graphs whose underlying simple graphs are odd wheels. Then, using the main theorem proved in [2] and [3], we find all the extremal cubic matching covered graphs. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We apply this lemma to deduce very simply the theorem of de Werra that each bipartite multigraph has a balanced k-edge-colouring for each positive integer k. We also apply the lemma to improve two earlier theorems of the first author which state that /$ s (G)=W(2(G) s)X if either (1) G is a bipartite multigraph, or (2) s is even and G is any multigraph; here /$ s (G) is the s-improper list chromatic index of G, i.e., the least possible value of k such that, if each edge of G is provided with a list l(e) of at least k colours, then G has an s-improper edge list colouring (so that at each vertex & not more than s edges incident with & receive the same colour), and, on each edge, the colour used lies in the list for that edge. The improvements that we obtain include that for each multiple edge of multiplicity m=mG(u, &), no colour is used on more than WmG(u, &) W(2(G) s)X X+1 edges joining u and &. 1998 Academic Press	adjacency list;color;edge coloring;list coloring;list edge-coloring;multigraph;multiple edges;vertex (geometry)	Anthony J.

The least number of colors in a dynamic coloring of G, denoted by χ2(G), is called the dynamic chromatic number of G. The least integer k, such that if every vertex of G is assigned a list of k colors, then G has a proper (resp. dynamic) coloring in which every vertex receives a color from its own list, is called the choice number of G, denoted ch(G) (resp. the dynamic choice number, denoted ch2(G)). It was recently conjectured [S. Akbari et al., On the list dynamic coloring of graphs, Discrete Appl. Math. (2009)] that for any graph G, ch2(G) = max(ch(G), χ2(G)). In this short note we disprove this conjecture. We first give the example of a small planar bipartite graph G with ch(G) = χ2(G) = 3 and ch2(G) = 4. Then, for any integer k ≥ 5, we construct a bipartite graph Gk such that ch(Gk) = χ2(Gk) = 3 and ch2(G) ≥ k.	color;graph coloring;list coloring	Louis Esperet	2010	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2010.08.007	integer;graph power;vertex;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;fractional coloring;bipartite graph;complete coloring;mathematics;list coloring;planar graph	Theory	24.83884563361009	30.3231647916356	145859

We show that there is a 2-connected outerplane graph G such that ? p ( G ) = 10 . If a 2-connected outerplane graph G is bipartite, then ? p ( G ) ? 8 , moreover, this bound is best possible. Highlights? The parity chromatic number of any 2-connected outerplane graph is at most 12. ? There is a 2-connected outerplane graph with parity chromatic number 10. ? The parity chromatic number of any 2-connected bipartite outerplane graph is at most 8.	graph coloring	Július Czap	2011	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2011.06.009	graph power;edge-transitive graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;fractional coloring;degree;simplex graph;complete coloring;edge coloring;cycle graph;graph coloring;vertex;graph factorization;mathematics;windmill graph;butterfly graph;list coloring;bound graph;greedy coloring;neighbourhood;string graph;circulant graph;planar graph	Theory	28.290504230546958	27.927960950579628	146538

In a geometric outerplanar graph, all the vertices have location coordinates in the plane and lie on the boundary of the graph. Our algorithm consists of three phases. First, it elects a vertex as the leader. Second, it explores the graph to determine relevant information about the structure of the input graph. Third, with this information, it computes a maximal 2-packing set. When the input graph is a ring, the algorithm computes a maximum 2-packing set. The execution time of this algorithm is O(n) steps and it uses O(nlogn) messages. This algorithm does not require knowledge of the size of the input graph. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deterministic distributed algorithm that solves such a problem for a geometric outerplanar graph in a linear number of steps.	distributed algorithm;maximal set;outerplanar graph	Joel Antonio Trejo-Sánchez;José Alberto Fernández-Zepeda	2014	J.

Such a labeling is called super if the p smallest possible labels appear at the vertices. In this paper we prove that every even regular graph and every odd regular graph with a 1-factor are super (a,1)-edge-antimagic total. We also introduce some constructions of non-regular super (a,1)-edge-antimagic total graphs.

8714b099fa99b0e7cc921ed70be5dcde1afc8c77	on the edge dimension of a graph		Given a connected graph G, the edge dimension, denoted edim(G), is the least size of a set S that distinguishes every edge of G, in the sense that different edges have different tuples of distances to the elements of S. The notation was introduced by Kelenc, Tratnik, and Yero, and in their paper they asked several questions. In this article we answer two of these questions: on graphs of maximal edge dimension and on a conjectured upper bound of the ratio between edim(G) and dim(G) (here dim(G) is the standard metric dimension of G). We classify the graphs for which edim(G) = n − 1 and show that edim(G) dim(G) isn’t bounded from above. We also compute edim(G2Pm) and edim(G+K1).	connectivity (graph theory);existential quantification;graph (discrete mathematics);maximal set;metric dimension (graph theory)	Nina Zubrilina	2018	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2018.04.010	connectivity;combinatorics;tuple;vertex (geometry);metric dimension;mathematics;notation;bounded function;dimension (graph theory);pairwise comparison	Theory	29.459928824876787	28.703081111759918	147982

66cb01caea03656040a7bd2897be96f323c8fb5f	distant irregularity strength of graphs with bounded minimum degree		Consider a graph $G=(V,E)$ without isolated edges and with maximum degree $\Delta$. Given a colouring $c:E\to\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$, the weighted degree of a vertex $v\in V$ is the sum of its incident colours, i.e., $\sum_{e\ni v}c(e)$. For any integer $r\geq 2$, the least $k$ admitting the existence of such $c$ attributing distinct weighted degrees to any two different vertices at distance at most $r$ in $G$ is called the $r$-distant irregularity strength of $G$ and denoted by $s_r(G)$. This graph invariant provides a natural link between the well known 1--2--3 Conjecture and irregularity strength of graphs. In this paper we apply the probabilistic method in order to prove an upper bound $s_r(G)\leq (4+o(1))\Delta^{r-1}$ for graphs with minimum degree $\delta\geq \ln^8\Delta$, improving thus far best upper bound $s_r(G)\leq 6\Delta^{r-1}$.

We say that this collection is cross-intersecting if for any i, j ∈ [k] with i = j, A ∈ Ai and B ∈ Aj implies A ∩ B = ∅. We consider a theorem of Hilton which gives a best possible upper bound on the sum of the cardinalities of uniform cross-intersecting families. We formulate a graphtheoretic analogue of Hilton’s cross-intersection theorem, similar to the one developed by Holroyd, Spencer and Talbot for the Erdős-Ko-Rado theorem. In particular we build on a result of Borg and Leader for signed sets and prove a theorem for uniform cross-intersecting subfamilies of independent vertex subsets of a disjoint union of complete graphs. We proceed to obtain a result for a larger class of graphs, namely chordal graphs, and propose a conjecture for all graphs. We end by proving this conjecture for the cycle on n vertices.	borg (star trek);erdős number;independent set (graph theory);protein family	Vikram Kamat	2011	Australasian J.

24b6a6fc63234aee6cdc8bc103f4e20d89238418	vertex-coloring with defects		Defective coloring is a variant of the traditional vertex-coloring in which adjacent vertices are allowed to have the same color, as long as the induced monochromatic components have a certain structure. Due to its important applications, as for example in the bipartisation of graphs, this type of coloring has been extensively studied, mainly with respect to the size, degree, diameter, and acyclicity of the monochromatic components. We focus on defective colorings with κ colors in which the monochromatic components are acyclic and have small diameter, namely we consider (edge, κ)-colorings, in which the monochromatic components have diameter 1, and (star, κ)-colorings, in which they have diameter 2. We prove that the (edge, 3)-coloring problem remains NP-complete even for graphs with maximum vertex-degree 6, hence answering an open question posed by Cowen et al. [10], and for planar graphs with maximum vertex-degree 7, and we prove that the (star, 3)-coloring problem is NPcomplete even for planar graphs with bounded maximum vertex-degree. On the other hand, we give linear-time algorithms for testing the existence of (edge, 2)-colorings and of (star, 2)-colorings of partial 2-trees. Finally, we prove that outerpaths, a notable subclass of outerplanar graphs, always admit (star, 2)-colorings.	a* search algorithm;color;defective coloring;degree (graph theory);directed acyclic graph;graph coloring;graph drawing;monochrome;np-completeness;neighbourhood (graph theory);outerplanar graph;planar graph;software bug;time complexity;treewidth;usability;xerox star	Patrizio Angelini;Michael A.

We show how to compute in O ( m + n ) worst-case time: • The total number of strongly connected components in G  e (resp., G  v ), for all edges e (resp., for all vertices v ) in G. • The size of the largest and of the smallest strongly connected components in G  e (resp., G  v ), for all edges e (resp., for all vertices v ) in G . Let G be strongly connected. We say that edge e (resp., vertex v ) separates two vertices x and y , if x and y are no longer strongly connected in G  e (resp., G  v ). We also show how to build in O ( m + n ) time O ( n )-space data structures that can answer in optimal time the following basic connectivity queries on digraphs: • Report in O ( n ) worst-case time all the strongly connected components of G  e (resp., G  v ), for a query edge e (resp., vertex v ). • Test whether an edge or a vertex separates two query vertices in O (1) worst-case time. • Report all edges (resp., vertices) that separate two query vertices in optimal worst-case time, i.e., in time O ( k ), where k is the number of separating edges (resp., separating vertices). (For k = 0, the time is O (1)). All our bounds are tight and are obtained with a common algorithmic framework, based on a novel compact representation of the decompositions induced by 1-edge and 1-vertex cuts in digraphs, which might be of independent interest. With the help of our data structures we can design efficient algorithms for several other connectivity problems on digraphs and we can also obtain in linear time a strongly connected spanning subgraph of G with O ( n ) edges that maintains the 1-connectivity cuts of G and the decompositions induced by those cuts.	failure;strongly connected component	Loukas Georgiadis;Giuseppe F.

In the literature, this has been pointed out to be very important in order to establish the real nature of a combinatorial problem.An oriented k -coloring of an oriented graph G ? = ( V , E ? ) is a partition of V into k subsets such that there are no two adjacent vertices belonging to the same subset, and all the arcs between a pair of subsets have the same orientation. The decision problem k - oriented chromatic number ( ocn k ) consists of an oriented graph G ? and an integer k 0 , plus the question if there exists an oriented k -coloring of G ? . By its strong appeal, many papers have presented NP-completeness proofs for ocn k . It was not known the complexity status of ocn k when the input graph G ? satisfies that the underlying graph G has maximum degree 3.In this paper we prove that ocn 4 is NP-complete for an acyclic oriented graph G ? such that G is at same time: connected, planar, bipartite, and with maximum degree 3.Our result defines a P versus NP-complete dichotomy with respect to the maximum degree Δ ( G ) : ocn k is polynomial if Δ ( G ) < 3 and NP-complete if Δ ( G ) ? 3 , since it is known that ocn 3 is in P, and that ocn k is in P when the underlying graph has Δ ( G ) ? 2 .	directed acyclic graph;graph coloring;oriented coloring;planar graph	Hebert Coelho;Luérbio Faria;Sylvain Gravier;Sulamita Klein	2016	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2015.06.023	gallai–hasse–roy–vitaver theorem;graph power;edge-transitive graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;np-complete;topology;bipartite graph;degree;graph toughness;regular graph;distance-regular graph;simplex graph;edge coloring;aperiodic graph;graph coloring;graph factorization;mathematics;voltage graph;vertex-transitive graph;list coloring;graph minor;bound graph;biregular graph;complement graph;line graph;planar graph	Theory	27.58893764031957	26.06270683004812	151204

In wireless networks, a node interferes with other nodes, the level of interference depending on numerous parameters: distance between the nodes, geographical topography, obstacles, etc. We model this with a weighted graph (G,w) where the weight function w on the edges of G represents the noise (interference) between the two endvertices. The total interference in a node is then the sum of all the noises of the nodes emitting on the same frequency. A weighted t-improper k-colouring of (G,w) is a k-colouring of the nodes of G (assignment of k frequencies) such that the interference at each node does not exceed the threshold t. We consider here the Weighted Improper Colouring problem which consists in determining the weighted t-improper chromatic number defined as the minimum integer k such that (G,w) admits a weighted t-improper k-colouring. We also consider the dual problem, denoted the Threshold Improper Colouring problem, where, given a number k of colours, we want to determine the minimum real t such that (G,w) admits a weighted t-improper k-colouring. We first present general upper bounds for both problems; in particular we show a generalisation of Lovász’s Theorem for the weighted t-improper chromatic number. Motivated by the original application, we then study a special interference model on various grids (square, triangular, hexagonal) where a node produces a noise of intensity 1 for its neighbours and a noise of intensity 1/2 for the nodes at distance two. We derive the weighted t-improper chromatic number for all values of t.	algorithm;assignment problem;color;duality (optimization);graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;heuristic (computer science);induced subgraph;interference (communication);linear programming;topography;vertex (geometry);weight function	Júlio Araújo;Jean-Claude Bermond;Frédéric Giroire;Frédéric Havet;Dorian Mazauric;Remigiusz Modrzejewski	2011	J.

A wheel W n is a graph on n vertices obtained from a C n − 1 by adding one vertex w and making w adjacent to all vertices of the C n − 1 . We obtain two exact values for small wheels: ex ( n , W 5 ) = ⌊ n 2 4 + n 2 ⌋ , ex ( n , W 7 ) = ⌊ n 2 4 + n 2 + 1 ⌋ . Given that ex ( n , W 6 ) is already known, this paper completes the spectrum for all wheels up to 7 vertices. In addition, we present the construction which gives us the lower bound ex ( n , W 2 k + 1 ) u003e ⌊ n 2 4 ⌋ + ⌊ n 2 ⌋ in general case.	wheels	Tomasz Dzido;Andrzej Jastrzebski	2018	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2017.10.003	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;isomorphism;turán number;vertex (geometry);mathematics;upper and lower bounds;graph;vertex (graph theory)	Theory	30.677984212011115	28.229987070166764	152556

The main theorem give good bounds on the connectivity of these complexes, given bounds for a few subcomplexes of the same class. Two applications are presented. Firstly, we show that the independence complex of a claw-free graph with n vertices and maximal degree d is (cn/d + ε)–connected, where c = 2/3. This can be compared with the result of Szabó and Tardos that c = 1/2 is optimal with no restrictions on the graphs. Secondly, we calculate the connectivity of a family of complexes used in Babson and Kozlov’s proof of Lovász conjecture.	carrier-to-noise ratio;claw-free graph;claw-free permutation;lovász conjecture;maximal set	Alexander Engström	2008	Eur.

Consider a hereditary family   G   of graphs. An oriented graph   G(V,E)   is called   G   -mixed  if its edge set can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets   E     1   ,E     2    such that   G(V,E     1   )∈  G  ,    G(V,E     2   )   is transitive and for every three vertices   w,v,u   if   w→v∈E     2    and   (u,v)∈E     1    then   (u,w)∈E     1   ; the letter   G   is generic and is replaced by specific names. The   G  -mixed graphs have a polynomial time algorithm to find maximum weight cliques, when   G   has such an algorithm.  We define a new family of intersection graphs called interval-filament graphs which contain the polygon-circle graphs, the circle graphs, the chordal graphs and the cocomparability graphs. Let  I  be a family of intervals on a line   L  . In the plane, above   L  , construct to each interval   i∈I   a curve   f     i    connecting its two endpoints, such that if two intervals are disjoint, their curves do not intersect;   FI={f     i   ∣i∈I}   is a  family of interval filaments  and its intersection graph is an  interval-filament graph . We prove that a graph is an interval-filament graph iff its complement is a cointerval-mixed graph. Since cointerval graphs have a polynomial time algorithm to find maximum weight cliques, we can find maximum weight independent sets in interval-filament graphs using the algorithm for maximum weight cliques in cointerval-mixed graphs. Interval-filament graphs have also an algorithm to find maximum weight cliques.  New families of intersection graphs of filaments are defined using families of circular-arcs of a circle and families of subtrees of a tree or of a cactus.	clique (graph theory);independent set (graph theory)	Fanica Gavril	2000	Inf.

For a graph H and for ρ ≥ 1, the mean RamseyTurán number RT (n, H, ρ − mean) is the maximum number of edges a ρ-mean colored graph with n vertices can have under the condition it does not have a monochromatic copy of H. It is conjectured that RT (n, Km, 2 − mean) = RT (n, Km, 2) where RT (n, H, k) is the maximum number of edges a k edge-colored graph with n vertices can have under the condition it does not have a monochromatic copy of H. We prove the conjecture holds for K3. We also prove that RT (n, H, ρ − mean) ≤ RT (n, Kχ(H), ρ − mean) + o(n). This result is tight for graphs H whose clique number equals their chromatic number. In particular we get that if H is a 3-chromatic graph having a triangle then RT (n, H, 2−mean) = RT (n, K3, 2−mean)+o(n) = RT (n, K3, 2) + o(n) = 0.4n(1 + o(1)).	clique (graph theory);color;graph coloring;monochrome;vertex (geometry)	Raphael Yuster	2006	Journal of Graph Theory	10.1002/jgt.20174		Theory	29.052715125241527	26.83311595977119	152953

By H.-J. Lai (1988), this was proved to be false. Necessary and sufficient conditions for corresponding counterexamples were also displayed. However, this characterization is not complete because some counterexamples were overlooked as is proved in this note. Furthermore, a counterexample to a theorem of Chartrand and Wall (1973) about hamiltonian index of graphs with hamiltonian cyclic blocks was exhibited by Lai (1988). Here an alternative version of this theorem is presented. The line graph L(G) of a graph G has E(G) as its vertex set and two vertices of L(G) are adjacent if and only if they are adjacent as edges in G. The n-th iterated line graph L”(G) is defined recursively as L’(G)= G, L”(G)= L(L”-l(G)). For a connected graph G that is not a path we define the hamiltonian index of G (denoted by h(G)) as the smallest n such that L”(G) is hamiltonian graph. A circuit is a sequence of vertices z)~, a,, . . . , ~suchthat Vi-1 uiEE(G)(i=I,...,k)are pairwise distinct edges and u. = ok. A circuit D is dominating (resp. spanning) if every edge of G is incident to a vertex of D (resp. if D contains all the vertices of G). Obviously, every spanning circuit is also dominating. Harary and Nash-Williams [3] showed that for a connected graph G, L(G) is hamiltonian if and only if either G is isomorphic to Kr,, for some ~33 or G contains a dominating circuit. Following [4] we define an arc in G as a path in G all of whose internal vertices have degree 2 in G. If A is an arc, then (E(A)1 is the length qfA.

For every positive integer  k  there is a smallest integer   f  (  k  )   such that for any two vertices  s  and  t  in a non-bipartite   f  (  k  )  -connected graph  G , there is an  s – t  path  P  in  G  with specified parity such that   G  −  V  (  P  )   is  k -connected.    This conjecture is a variant of the well-known conjecture of Lovasz with the parity condition. Indeed, this conjecture is strictly stronger. Lovasz' conjecture is wide open for   k  ⩾  3  .  In this paper, we show that   f  (  1  )  =  5   and   6  ⩽  f  (  2  )  ⩽  8  .

Then there is an odd cycle  C  avoiding  s  such that   G  −  V  (  C  )   is 2-connected.	removable media	Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi;Orlando Lee;Bruce A. Reed	2014	J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

We prove that (i) for any %-graph of order n 23, it has both a {n,n 2}tree-decomposition and a {n 1,n 1}-tree-decomposition, and moreover, these two kinds of tree-decompositions can be transformed to each other; (ii) for any Y3-graph of order n 24, it has three kinds of tree-decompositions: {n, n, n 3}-, { n,n-1,n-2}-and{n-1,n-1,n-l}-treedecomposition, and moreover, they can be transformed to each other. Since 2-connected mpb graphs are &-graphs and mp graphs are B3-graphs, the results mentioned above from [l-3] are immediately implied by our results. Furthermore, all tree-decompositions above can be found in polynomial time. @ 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Interval hypergraphs have been characterized by Tucker (J. Combin. Theory 12 (1972) 153) in terms of excluded subhypergraphs. In this paper, we strengthen Tucker’s result for clutters by characterizing interval clutters in terms of excluded partial clutters, as well as excluded minors. Since minor and partial clutter relations are much more restrictive than the subhypergraph relation, our results are more applicable than Tucker’s result in many situations. As a lemma, we also determine all the minor minimal clutters that have a circuit subhypergraph but not a circuit minor. c © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.	clutter;tucker decomposition	Guoli Ding	2002	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/S0012-365X(01)00354-5	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;interval graph;mathematics;clutter;automated theorem proving;algorithm;algebra;minor	Theory	30.92582561078342	30.412126983453145	155758

Therefore many attempts are made to find upper and lower bounds, or exact values of alpha(G) for special classes of graphs. This paper is aimed toward studying this problem for the class of generalized Petersen graphs. We find new upper and lower bounds and some exact values for alpha(P(n, k)). With a computer program we have obtained exact values for each n   2k. We prove this conjecture for some cases. In particular, we show that if n > 3k, the conjecture is valid. We checked the conjecture with our table for n < 78 and it had no inconsistency. Finally, we show that for every fixed k, alpha(P(n,k)) can be computed using an algorithm with running time O(n).	julius petersen	Nazli Besharati;J. B. Ebrahimi;A.

The θr-girth of a graph G is the minimum number of edges of a subgraph of G that can be contracted to θr. This notion generalizes the usual concept of girth which corresponds to the case r = 2. In [Minors in graphs of large girth, Random Structures & Algorithms, 22(2):213–225, 2003], Kühn and Osthus showed that graphs of sufficiently large minimum degree contain clique-minors whose order is an exponential function of their girth. We extend this result for the case of θrgirth and we show that the minimum degree can be replaced by some connectivity measurement. As an application of our results, we prove that, for every fixed r, graphs excluding as a minor the disjoint union of k θr’s have treewidth O(k · log k).

A graph $G=(V, E)$ with a partition $V=Pcup N$ where $N$ is an independent set is a partitioned probe cograph if one can add new edges between certain vertices in $N$ in such a way that the graph obtained is a cograph. We characterize partitioned probe cographs in terms of five forbidden induced subgraphs. Using this characterization, we give a linear-time recognition algorithm for partitioned probe cographs. Our algorithm produces a certificate for membership that can be checked in linear time and a certificate for non-membership that can be checked in sublinear time.	time complexity	Van Bang Le;H.

Let ź denote the minimum degree of a graph. In 2011, Wang proposed a more general question to find a function f ( ź ) ( f ( ź ) ź 2 ź + 1 ) such that for each properly edge-colored graph of order f ( ź ) , there exists a rainbow matching of size ź . The best bound so far is f ( ź ) ź 3.5 ź + 2 due to Lo. Babu etźal. considered this problem in strongly edge-colored graphs in which each path of length 3 is rainbow. They proved that if G is a strongly edge-colored graph of order at least 2 ź 3 ź 4 ź , then G has a rainbow matching of size ź 3 ź 4 ź . They proposed an interesting question: Is there a constant c greater than 3 4 such that every strongly edge-colored graph G has a rainbow matching of size at least c ź if | V ( G ) | ź 2 ź c ź ź ? Clearly, c ź 1 . We prove that if G is a strongly edge-colored graph with minimum degree ź and order at least 2 ź + 2 , then G has a rainbow matching of size ź .	matching (graph theory);pop'n twinbee: rainbow bell adventures	Guanghui Wang;Guiying Yan;Xiaowei Yu	2016	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2016.04.016	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;latin square;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	29.586680247508756	26.99955805524081	157242

Let G be a simple graph without isolated vertices with edge set E(G), and let j and k be two positive integers. A function f : E(G) → {−1, 1} is said to be a signed star j-dominating function on G if ∑ e∈E(v) f(e) ≥ j for every vertex v of G, where E(v) = {uv ∈ E(G) | u ∈ N(v)}. A set {f1, f2, . . . , fd} of distinct signed star j-dominating functions on G with the property that ∑d i=1 fi(e) ≤ k for each e ∈ E(G), is called a signed star (j, k)-dominating family (of functions) on G. The maximum number of functions in a signed star (j, k)-dominating family on G is the signed star (j, k)-domatic number of G denoted by d (j,k) SS (G). In this paper we study properties of the signed star (j, k)-domatic number of a graph G. In particular, we determine bounds on d (j,k) SS (G). Some of our results extend those ones given by Atapour, Sheikholeslami, Ghameslou and Volkmann [1] for the signed star domatic number, Sheikholeslami and Volkmann [5] for the signed star (k, k)-domatic number and Sheikholeslami and Volkmann [4] for the signed star k-domatic number.	domatic number;graph (discrete mathematics);vertex (graph theory)	Seyed Mahmoud Sheikholeslami;Lutz Volkmann	2010	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2009.09.015	vertex;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;star;regular graph;mathematics	Theory	25.502335680761494	31.17375092455137	158296

8391f1cd4aed888c1888a7793270c9cf4b5e799c	dynamically operating on threshold graphs and related classes (extended abstract)		A graph G = (V,E) is a threshold graph if there is a mapping a : V → R+ and a positive real number S such that a(v) < S for all v ∈ V and (v, w) ∈ E if and only if a(v) + a(w) ≥ S. It is well known that G can be partitioned into a clique K and a stable set I. Threshold graphs constitute a very important and well studied class in graph theory and graph algorithms, since they have applications in several fields, such as psychology, parallel processing, scheduling. For this reason, threshold graphs have been defined many times in the literature, with different names (see, e.g. [4,6,7]). A similar definition describes the class of difference graphs (also known as chain graphs): a graph G = (V,E) is a difference graph if there is mapping a : V → R and a positive real number T such that |a(v)| < T for all v ∈ V and (v, w) ∈ E if and only if |a(v)− a(w)| ≥ T . Difference and threshold graphs are incomparable; difference graphs have been also independently introduced several times, for example in [5,8,12]. For a comprehensive survey on threshold graphs, difference graphs and related topics, see [9].	algorithm;graph (discrete mathematics);graph theory;parallel computing;scheduling (computing)	Tiziana Calamoneri;Angelo Monti;Rossella Petreschi	2015			discrete mathematics;combinatorics;computer science;graph	Theory	26.469210567581293	26.169032007384278	160110

Each symmetric matrix M over 0; 1; deenes a list partition problem. Diierent choices of the matrix M lead to many well-known graph the-oretic problems including the problem of recognizing split graphs and their generalizations, nding homogeneous sets, joins, clique cutsets, stable cutsets, skew cutsets and so on. We develop tools which allow us to classify the complexity of many list partition problems and, in particular, yield the complete classiication for small matrices M. Along the way, we obtain a variety of speciic results including: generalizations of Lovv asz's communication bound on the number of clique-versus-stable-set separators; polynomial-time algorithms to recognize generalized split graphs; a polynomial algorithm for the list version of the Clique Cutset Problem; and the rst subexponential algorithm for the Skew Cutset Problem of Chvv atal. We also show that the dichotomy (NP-complete versus polynomial-time solvable), conjectured for certain graph homomorphism problems would, if true, imply a slightly weaker dichotomy (NP-complete versus quasipolynomial) for our list partition problems 1.

It is known that (G)¿0 for any k-chromatic uniquely vertex-colourable graph G (k-UCG), and, S.J. Xu has conjectured that for any k-UCG, G; (G) = 0 implies that cl(G) = k; in which cl(G) is the clique number of G. In this paper, rst, we introduce the concept of the core of a k-UCG as an induced subgraph without any colour-class of size one, and without any vertex of degree k − 1. Considering (k; n)-cores as k-UCGs on n vertices, we show that edge-minimal (k; 2k)-cores do not exist when k¿3, which shows that for any edge-minimal k-UCG on 2k vertices either the conjecture is true or there exists a colour-class of size one. Also, we consider the structure of edge-minimal (k; 2k + 1)-cores and we show that such cores exist for all k¿4. Moreover, we characterize all edge-minimal (4; 9)-cores and we show that there are only seven such cores (up to isomorphism). Our proof shows that Xu’s conjecture is true in the case of edge-minimal (4; 9)-cores. c © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

These extremal problems are special cases of the general question of realizability of graph invariants. For example a (p, Δ, δ, λ) graph is a graph having p-points, maximum degree Δ, minimum degree δ, and line-connectivity λ. An arbitrary quadruple of integers (a, b, c, d) is called (p, Δ, δ, γ) realizable if there is a (p, Δ, δ, γ) graph with p = a, Δ = b, δ = c, and γ = d. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a quadruple to be (p, Δ, δ, γ) realizable were recently given by the authors. In another manuscript they gave the solution to (p, Δ, δ, k) realizability, where k denotes the point connectivity. In this work we give necessary and sufficient conditions for (p, q, k), (p, q, γ), and (p, q, δ) realizability, where q denotes the number of lines of a graph.		Francis T. Boesch;Charles L.

6d554d5f71ebb36f349a853006fe8ebdde29e1af	on the complexity of frequent subtree mining in very simple structures		We study the complexity of frequent subtree mining in very simple graphs beyond forests. We show for d-tenuous outerplanar graphs that frequent subtrees can be listed with polynomial delay if the cycle degree, i.e., the maximum number of blocks that share a common vertex, is bounded by some constant. The crucial step in the proof of this positive result is a polynomial time algorithm deciding subgraph isomorphism from trees into d-tenuous outerplanar graphs of bounded cycle degree. We obtain this algorithm by generalizing the algorithm of Shamir and Tsur that decides subgraph isomorphism between trees. Our results may also be of some interest to algorithmic graph theory, as they indicate that even for very simple structures, the cycle degree is a crucial parameter for the tractability of subgraph isomorphism. We also discuss some interesting problems towards generalizing the positive result of this work.	frequent subtree mining	Pascal Welke;Tamás Horváth;Stefan Wrobel	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-23708-4_14	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;subgraph isomorphism problem;mathematics;graph isomorphism;induced subgraph isomorphism problem;maximum common subgraph isomorphism problem;algorithm	ML	24.62495371858758	25.631437369596274	163250

Mostly, the list colorings and the precoloring extensions are considered. In one of the most general formulations, a graph G = (V,E), sets L(v) of admissible colors, and natural numbers cv for the vertices v ∈ V are given, and the question is whether there can be chosen a subset C(v) ⊆ L(v) of cardinality cv for each vertex in such a way that the sets C(v), C(v′) are disjoint for each pair v, v′ of adjacent vertices. The particular case of constant |L(v)| with cv = 1 for all v ∈ V leads to the concept of choice number, a graph parameter showing unexpectedly different behavior compared to the chromatic number, despite these two invariants have nearly the same value for almost all graphs. To illustrate typical techniques, some of the proofs are sketched.	color;graph coloring;neighbourhood (graph theory)	Zsolt Tuza	1997	Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory	10.7151/dmgt.1049	gallai–hasse–roy–vitaver theorem;graph power;brooks' theorem;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;fractional coloring;complete coloring;edge coloring;graph coloring;mathematics;list coloring;greedy coloring;neighbourhood	Theory	29.12345920966015	25.839645947409707	163285

We find a lower bound on the independence number of the random subgraph G1/2(n, 2, 1).		N. M. Derevyanko;S. G. Kiselev	2017	Probl. Inf.

The harmonious chromatic number is the least integer k for which G admits a harmonious coloring with k colors. Extending previous NP-completeness results of the harmonious coloring problem on subclasses of chordal and co-chordal graphs, we prove that the problem remains NP-complete for split undirected path graphs; we also prove that the problem is NP-complete for colinear graphs by showing that split undirected path graphs form a subclass of colinear graphs. Moreover, we provide a polynomial solution for the harmonious coloring problem for the class of split strongly chordal graphs, the interest of which lies on the fact that the problem has been proved to be NP-complete on both split and strongly chordal graphs.	color;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;harmonious coloring;np-completeness;path (graph theory);polynomial	Kyriaki Ioannidou;Stavros D.

In this talk we give some (combinatorial and algebraic) proofs of the fact that every edge-distance-regular graph G is distanceregular and homogeneous. More precisely, G is edge-distance-regular if and only if it is bipartite distance-regular or a generalized odd graph.

This specific subgraph should be distinguished from k-cores, which are principally different subgraphs in networks. If the vertex mean degree of a network is sufficiently large, the core is a giant cluster containing a finite fraction of vertices. We find that generalization of this pruning algorithm to directed networks provides a significantly more complex picture of cores. By implementing a rate equation approach to this pruning procedure for directed uncorrelated networks, we identify a set of cores progressively embedded into each other in a network and describe their birth points and structure.	algorithm;complex network;degeneracy (graph theory);embedded system;graph (discrete mathematics);recursion;vertex (geometry)	N.

It is difficult to decide, even for a small matrix M , whether the M -partition problem is polynomial time solvable or NP-complete (or possibly neither), and whether M -partitionable graphs can be characterized by a finite set of forbidden induced subgraphs (or perhaps some other first order condition). We discuss these problems for the class of chordal graphs.

The global irregularity of a digraph  D  is defined by  i  g ( D )=max{ d  + ( x ), d  − ( x )}−min{ d  + ( y ), d  − ( y )} over all vertices  x  and  y  of  D  (including  x = y ). If  i  g ( D )=0, then  D  is regular and if  i  g ( D )⩽1, then  D  is almost regular.  A  c -partite tournament is an orientation of a complete  c -partite graph. In 1998, Guo and Kwak showed that, if  D  is a regular  c -partite tournament with  c ⩾4, then every arc of  D  is in a directed cycle, which contains vertices from exactly  m  partite sets for all  m ∈{4,5,…, c }. In this paper we shall extend this theorem to almost regular  c -partite tournaments, which have at least two vertices in each partite set. An example will show that there are almost regular  c -partite tournaments with arbitrary large  c  such that not all arcs are in directed cycles through exactly 3 partite sets. Another example will show that the result is not valid for the case that  c =4 and there is only one vertex in a partite set.

The paired-domination problem on G asks for a minimum-cardinality dominating set S of G such that the subgraph induced by S contains a perfect matching; motivation for this problem comes from the interest in finding a small number of locations to place pairs of mutually visible guards so that the entire set of guards monitors a given area. The paired-domination problem on general graphs is known to be NP-complete. In this paper, we consider the paired-domination problem on permutation graphs. We define an embedding of permutation graphs in the plane which enables us to obtain an equivalent version of the problem involving points in the plane, and we describe a sweeping algorithm for this problem; given the permutation over the set Nn = {1, 2, . . . , n} defining a permutation graph on n vertices, our algorithm computes a paired-dominating set of the graph in O(n) time, and is therefore optimal.	algorithm;dominating set;matching (graph theory);np-completeness;vertex (graph theory)	Evaggelos Lappas;Stavros D.

When R = Zpn and V = R2v , they proved that GSpR(V ) is an strongly regular graph when ν = 1 and Li, Wang and Guo (2012) [6] showed that it is a strictly Deza graph when ν ≥ 2. In this paper, we study symplectic graphs over finite local rings. We can classify if our graph is a strongly regular graph or a strictly Deza graph.We also show that it is arc transitive. Moreover, we apply the combinatorial technique presented in Meemark and Prinyasart (2011) [8] to prove similar results on subconstituents of symplectic graphs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We mainly focus on  k -spine ,  1-bend planar drawings, showing that for each   k  ⩾  2  , there exists a planar graph that is not  k -spine ,  1-bend planar, and furthermore, that it is   NP  -hard to test  k -spine ,  1-bend planarity. Given this complexity result, we further narrow our focus onto 2-spine ,  1-bend planar drawings. We characterize 2-spine ,  1-bend planarity using a new generalization of Hamiltonian graphs that we call Hamiltonian-with-handles graphs. We observe that our characterization naturally extends the connection between 2-page book embeddings and Hamiltonicity. Finally, we use our characterization to show that 2-outerplanar graphs are 2-spine ,  1-bend planar.	planar graph;planarity testing	Emilio Di Giacomo;Walter Didimo;Giuseppe Liotta;Matthew Suderman	2006	Theor.

Then, u strongly dominates v and v weakly dominates u if (i) uv ~ E and (ii) deg u >/deg v. A set D c V is a strong-dominating set (sd-set) of G if every vertex in V D is strongly dominated by at least one vertex in D. Similarly, a weak-dominating set (wd-set) is defined. The strong (weak) domination number 7s (7w) of G is the minimum cardinality of an sd-set (wd-set). Besides investigating some relationship of ?s and ?w with other known parameters of G, some bounds are obtained. A graph G is domination balanced if there exists an sd-set D1 and a wd-set/)2 such that D1 c~D2 = 0. A study of domination balanced graphs is initiated. Let G = (V, E) be a g raph and uv e E. Then, u and v dominate each other. Fur ther , u strongly dominates v and v weakly dominates u if deg u >~ deg v. S t rong and weak d o m i n a t i o n arise na tu ra l ly in cer ta in prac t ica l s i tuat ions. F o r example , cons ider a ne twork of roads connec t ing a number of locat ions. In such a ne twork , the degree of a vertex v is the number of roads meet ing at v. Suppose deg u >~ deg v. Na tu ra l ly , the traffic at u is heavier than tha t a t v. If we cons ider the traffic between u and v, preference should be given to the vehicles going f rom u to v. Thus, in some sense, u s t rongly domina te s v and v weakly domina te s u. A subset D of V is a dominating set of G if every vertex v in V D is d o m i n a t e d by some u ~ D. Fur the r , D is a strong dominating set (sd-set) if every vertex v ~ V D is s t rongly d o m i n a t e d by some u in D. Similarly, we define a weak dominating set (wd-set). The domination number 7(G) of G is the m i n i m u m card ina l i ty of a d o m i n a t i n g set. Similar ly, we define the strong domination number 7~(G) and the weak domination number ~/w(G) of G.

6b544ee6616e5dca3769d66c9d01e64344c4271c	matching preclusion for n-grid graphs		Abstract A matching preclusion set of a graph is an edge set whose deletion results in a graph without perfect matchings or almost perfect matchings. The Cartesian product of n paths is called an n -grid graph. In this paper, we study the matching preclusion problems for n -grid graphs and obtain the following results. If an n -grid graph has an even order, then it has the matching preclusion number n , and every optimal matching preclusion set is trivial except for the case of P 2 m □ P 3 , the Cartesian product of a path on 2 m vertices and a path on 3 vertices, when the nontrivial optimal matching preclusion sets are completely characterized. If the n -grid graph has an odd order, then it has the matching preclusion number n + 1 , and all the optimal matching preclusion sets are characterized.	matching preclusion	Qi Ding;Heping Zhang;Hui Zhou	2018	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2018.02.012	combinatorics;factor-critical graph;discrete mathematics;grid;lattice graph;mathematics;optimal matching;bipartite graph;cartesian product;matching preclusion;3-dimensional matching	Theory	27.054688335127064	27.7430669619906	168858

When k = q , the order of these q-regular graphs is 2(q2−1); and when k ≤ q−1, the order of these k -regular graphs is 2(qk − 2). Moreover, the incidence matrix of a k -regular balanced bipartite graph of girth 6 having 2(qk − 2) vertices, where k is an integer and q is a prime power with 3 ≤ k ≤ q − 1, is provided. These graphs improve upon the best known upper bounds for the number of vertices in regular graphs of girth 6. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Borodin showed that 1-planar graphs are 6-colorable, but his proof does not lead to an efficient algorithm. This paper presents a linear-time algorithm for 7-coloring 1-planar graphs. The main difficulty in the design of our algorithm comes from the fact that the class of 1-planar graphs is not closed under the operation of edge contraction. This difficulty is overcome by a structure lemma that may find useful in other problems on 1-planar graphs. This paper also shows that it is NP-complete to decide whether a given 1-planar graph is 4-colorable. The complexity of the problem of deciding whether a given 1-planar graph is 5-colorable is still unknown.	1-planar graph;algorithm;edge contraction;embedded system;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;karp's 21 np-complete problems;time complexity	Zhi-Zhong Chen;Mitsuharu Kouno	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-45138-9_29	1-planar graph;outerplanar graph;graph power;pathwidth;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;fractional coloring;complete coloring;edge coloring;nowhere-zero flow;cubic graph;graph coloring;vertex;symmetric graph;mathematics;voltage graph;butterfly graph;list coloring;graph minor;book embedding;line graph;circulant graph;planar graph	Theory	25.96158229731152	25.830921558415394	169881

Given a binary relation of size m defined on a set of size n, we present a polynomial time algorithm that finds a maximal transitive sub-relation in time O(n + nm). We also study the problem of finding a maximum transitive relation contained in a binary relation. This is the problem of computing a maximum transitive subgraph in a given digraph. For the class of directed graphs with the underlying graph being triangle-free, we present a 0.874-approximation algorithm. This is achieved via a simple connection to the problem of maximum directed cut. Further, we give an upper bound for the size of any maximum transitive relation to be m/4+cm, where c > 0 and m is the number of edges in the digraph.

For most bipartite H, the question is still wide open, and even the correct order of magnitude of log2 fn(H) is not known. We prove that for every m ≥ 2, fn(Km,m) ≤ 2O(n ), extending the result of Kleitman and Winston [15] and answering a question of Erdős. This bound is asymptotically sharp for m ∈ {2, 3}, and possibly for other values of m, for which the order of ex(n,Km,m) is not known, but it is conjectured to be Θ(n2−1/m). Our method also yields a bound on the number of Km,m-free graphs with fixed order and size, extending the result of Füredi [11]. Using this bound, we prove a relaxed version of a conjecture due to Haxell, Kohayakawa and Luczak [13] and show that almost all K3,3-free graphs of order n have more than 1/20 · ex(n,K3,3) edges.	binary logarithm;clique (graph theory);erdős number	József Balogh;Wojciech Samotij	2011	Combinatorica	10.1007/s00493-011-2610-y	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	31.75164296629826	27.80448022660735	170697
9685db4a1e90b294f1b40781c3f683a2a8ce22b4	average firefighting on infinite grids		In the Firefighter Problem, a fire breaks out at a vertex of a graph G, then f firefighters protect f vertices. At each subsequent time step, the fire spreads from each “burned” vertex to all of its unprotected neighbours, then f firefighters “protect” f unburned vertices. Once a vertex is protected or burned, it remains so from then onward. A common objective is to determine the minimum number f , such that if f vertices are protected at each time step, then the fire can be contained on a graph G. In this paper, average firefighting is introduced: the number of vertices protected in each time step is allowed to vary. If the number of firefighters used is periodic and the average number (per time step) is strictly greater than 3/2, then a fire on the Cartesian grid can be contained. Similar results are also determined for the triangular and strong grids.	graph (discrete mathematics);regular grid;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Margaret-Ellen Messinger	2008	Australasian J.

fabfd691ad7a3f5718adcfb5a078366e874f3813	the treewidth of line graphs		The treewidth of a graph is an important invariant in structural and algorithmic graph theory. This paper studies the treewidth of line graphs. We show that determining the treewidth of the line graph of a graph G is equivalent to determining the minimum vertex congestion of an embedding of G into a tree. Using this result, we prove sharp lower bounds in terms of both the minimum degree and average degree of G. These results are precise enough to exactly determine the treewidth of the line graph of a complete graph and other interesting examples. We also improve the best known upper bound on the treewidth of a line graph. Analogous results are proved for pathwidth.	graph theory;line graph;network congestion;pathwidth;treewidth	Daniel J.

Specifically, a polynomial time algorithm is presented for both classes of graphs. This algorithm is based on a new matrix representation of the interval and the proper interval graphs, which is being introduced here. The result establishes a threshold for the k -CLUSTER, between the -completeness and the polynomial solvability, since this problem is known to be -complete over the chordal graphs, which is a superclass of the interval graphs, while its complexity over the interval graphs was an interesting open question, having many applications.

A planar (simple) graph in which each face is a triangle is called a triangulation. It was proved in an earlier paper [A. Finbow, B. Hartnell, R. Nowakowski, M. Plummer, On well-covered triangulations: Part I, Discrete Appl. Math., 132, 2004, 97–108] that there are no 5-connected planar well-covered triangulations. It is the aim of the present paper to completely determine the 4-connected well-covered triangulations containing two adjacent vertices of degree 4. In a subsequent paper [A. Finbow, B. Hartnell, R. Nowakowski, M. Plummer, On well-covered triangulations: Part III (submitted for publication)], we show that every 4-connected well-covered triangulation contains two adjacent vertices of degree 4 and hence complete the task of characterizing all 4-connected well-covered planar triangulations. There turn out to be only four such graphs. This stands in stark contrast to the fact that there are infinitely many 3-connected well-covered planar triangulations. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Shortly afterward, Lai constructed a counterexample to this conjecture. Using the small subgraph conditioning method of Robinson and Wormald, we prove that a random 4-regular graph has an S 3 -decomposition asymptotically almost surely, provided the number of vertices is divisible by 3.

An S-detachment splits into a set ofp independent vertices1, ..., sp with d(sj) = dj , 1 ≤ j ≤ p. Given a requirement function r(u, v) on pairs of vertices of V , an S-detachment is called r-admissible if the detached graph G′ satisfiesλG′(x, y) ≥ r(x, y) for every pairx, y ∈ V . HereλH(u, v) denotes the local edge-connectivity between u andv in graphH. We prove that anr-admissibleS-detachment exists if and only if (a) λG(x, y) ≥ r(x, y), and (b)λG−s(x, y) ≥ r(x, y) − bdj/2c hold for everyx, y ∈ V . The special case of this characterization when r(x, y) = λG(x, y) for each pair inV was conjectured by B. Fleiner. Our result is a common generalization of a theorem of W. Mader on edge splittings preserving local edge-connectivity and a result of B. Fleiner on detachments preserving global edge-connectivity. Other corollaries include previous results of L. Lovász and C.J.St.A. Nash-Williams on edge splittings and detachments, respectively. As a new application, we extend a theorem of A.

22a7b2d672b44cfac0f20ef2e6d4fc7bbac6937c	string graphs of k-bend paths on a grid	approximate algorithm;graph coloring;intersection graphs;planar graph;chordal graph	We investigate the class of vertex intersection graphs of paths on a grid, and specifically consider the subclasses that are obtained when each path in the representation has at most k bends (turns). We call such a subclass the Bk-VPG graphs, k ≥ 0. If the number k of bends is not restricted, then the VPG graphs are shown to be equivalent to the well-known class of string graphs, namely, the intersection graphs of arbitrary curves in the plane. In the case of B0-VPG graphs, we observe that horizontal and vertical segments have strong Helly number 2, and thus the clique problem has polynomial-time complexity, given the path representation. We show that the coloring problem for Bk-VPG graphs, for k ≥ 0, is NP-complete and give a 2-approximation algorithm for coloring B0-VPG graphs. Furthermore, we prove that triangle-free B0-VPG graphs are 4-colorable, and this is best possible. We present a complete hierarchy of VPG graphs relating them to other known families of graphs. The grid intersection graphs are shown to be equivalent to the bipartite B0-VPG graphs. We prove the strict containment of B0-VPG into B1-VPG. Planar graphs are known to be in the class of string graphs, and we prove here that planar graphs are B3-VPG graphs.	algorithm;bk-tree;clique problem;graph coloring;np-completeness;planar graph;polynomial;random graph;time complexity;whole earth 'lectronic link	Andrei Asinowski;Elad Cohen;Martin Charles Golumbic;Vincent Limouzy;Marina Lipshteyn;Michal Stern	2011	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2011.05.025	strong perfect graph theorem;1-planar graph;block graph;pathwidth;split graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;cograph;interval graph;topology;graph product;longest path problem;dense graph;metric dimension;graph coloring;clique-sum;trapezoid graph;mathematics;maximal independent set;modular decomposition;treewidth;partial k-tree;chordal graph;indifference graph;planar graph	Theory	26.72441817674232	25.417909215960382	172462

By using decompositions of the additive group $\mathbf{Z}_r $ (integers mod r), these results are strengthened. Main Theorem: $s ( G )\leqq n + 1$ for any graph with $s( G ) < \infty $.

We observe that the zero-divisor graphs of reduced commutative semigroups (rings) are compact, thus provide a large class of graphs G that could be realized as zero-divisor graphs of posets.

This problem is motivated by coloring maps in which not all countries are contiguous. Since it is known that this problem is NP-hard for general graphs; we consider planar graphs and subclasses thereof. In Chapter 1 we introduce the topic of this thesis and in Chapter 2 we review relevant definitions and basic results. In Chapter 3 we prove that the maximum differential coloring problem remains NP-hard even for planar graphs. Then, we present tight bounds for regular caterpillars and spider graphs and close-to-optimal differential coloring algorithms for general caterpillars and biconnected triangle-free outer-planar graphs. In Chapter 4 we introduce the (d, kn)-differential coloring problem. While it was known that the problem of determining whether a general graph is (2, n)-differential colorable is NP-complete, in this chapter we provide a complete characterization of bipartite, planar and outerplanar graphs that admit (2, n)-differential colorings. We show that it is NP-complete to determine whether a graph admits a (3, 2n)differential coloring. The same negative result holds for the (b2n/3c, 2n)-differential coloring problem, even when input graph is planar. In Chapter 5 we experimentally evaluate and compare several algorithms for coloring a map. Motivated by different application scenarios, we classify our approaches into two categories, depending on the dimensionality of the underlying color space. To cope with the one dimensional color space (e.g., grayscale colors), we employ the (d, kn)-differential coloring. In Chapter 6 we describe a practical approach for visualizing multiple relationships defined on the same dataset using a geographic map metaphor, where clusters	algorithm;biconnected graph;color space;experiment;graph coloring;grayscale;karp's 21 np-complete problems;map;np-completeness;np-hardness;outerplanar graph;planar graph;regular expression	Sankaranarayanan Veeramoni Mythili	2014			computer science;artificial intelligence;cartography;computer graphics (images)	Theory	27.624599974039942	25.361868473039287	174968
3044abf89c70e11233f78e363a7ba84adbd0b63b	a proof of the two-path conjecture	hamiltonian cycle;connected graph;regular graph	Let G be a connected graph that is the edge-disjoint union of two paths of length n, where n ≥ 2. Using a result of Thomason on decompositions of 4-regular graphs into pairs of Hamiltonian cycles, we prove that G has a third path of length n. The “two-path conjecture” states that if a graph G is the edge-disjoint union of two paths of length n with at least one common vertex, then the graph has a third subgraph that is also a path of length n. For example, the complete graph K4 is an edge-disjoint union of two paths of length 3, each path meeting the other in four vertices. The cycle C6 is the edge-disjoint union of two paths of length 3 with common endpoints. In the first case, the graph has twelve paths of length 3; in the second there are six such paths. The two-path conjecture arose in a problem on randomly decomposable graphs. An H-decomposition of a graph G is a family of edge disjoint H– subgraphs of G whose union is G. An H-decomposable graph G is randomly H–decomposable if any edge disjoint family of H–subgraphs of G can be extended to an H–decomposition of G. (This concept was introduced by Ruiz in [7].) Randomly Pn-decomposable graphs were studied in [1, 5, 6, 4]. In attempting to classify randomly Pn-decomposable graphs, in [5] and [6] it was necessary to know whether the edge-disjoint union of two copies of Pn could have a unique Pn-decomposition. The two-path conjecture is stated as an unproved lemma in [3]. Our notation follows [2]. A path of length n is a trail with distinct vertices x0, . . . , xn, ([2], p. 5). We say that G decomposes into subgraphs X and Y when G is the edge-disjoint union of X and Y . Theorem. If G decomposes into two paths X and Y , each of length n with n ≥ 2, and X and Y have least one common vertex, then G has a path of length n distinct from X and Y . Proof. Label the vertices of X as x0, x1, . . . , xn, with xi−1 adjacent to xi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Similarly, label the vertices of Y as y0, y1, . . . , yn. Let s be the number of common vertices; thus G has 2n + 2 − s vertices. If s = 1, then we may assume by symmetry that xi = yj with i ≥ j and i ≥ 1 and j < n. In this case, the vertices x0, . . . , xi, yj+1, . . . yn form the electronic journal of combinatorics 9 (2002), #N4 2 a path of length at least n having a subpath of length n different from X and Y . Similarly, if s = 2, then we may let the common vertices be xi1, xi2 and yi1, yi2 with xi1 = yj1 and xi2 = yj2. Using symmetry again, we may assume that i1 < i2, j1 < j2, and i1 ≥ j1. With this labeling, again the vertices x0, . . . , xi1, yj1+1, . . . yn form a path with a subpath of length n different from X and Y . Hence we may assume that s ≥ 3. The approach above no longer works, since now the points of intersection need not occur in the same order on X and Y . Suppose first that the intersection contains an endpoint of one of the paths. We may assume that x0 = yk for some k with k < n. Now we consider two cases. If yk+1 is not a vertex of X, then we replace the edge xn−1xn with the edge yk+1x0 to create a third path of length n. If yk+1 = xi for some i, then we replace the edge xixi−1 with the edge yk+1x0 to create a new path of length n. Therefore, we may assume that s ≥ 3 and that none of {x0, xn, y0, yn} is among the s shared vertices. We apply a result of Thomason ([8], Theorem 2.1, pages 263-4): If H is a regular multigraph of degree 4 with at least 3 vertices, then for any two edges e and f there are an even number of decompositions of H into two Hamiltonian cycles C1 and C2 with e in C1 and f in C2. From the given graph G, we construct a 4-regular multigraph H. We first add the edges e0 = x0xn and f0 = y0yn. We then “smooth out” all vertices of degree 2; that is, we iteratively contract edges incident to vertices of degree 2 until no such vertices remain. Since every vertex of G∪{e0, f0} has degree 2 or degree 4, the resulting multigraph H is regular of degree 4. Since s ≥ 3, H has at least three vertices. In H, the edge e0 is absorbed into an edge e, and f0 is absorbed into an edge f . The cycles X ∪{e0} and Y ∪{f0} have been contracted to become Hamiltonian cycles in H. Together they decompose H. By the theorem of Thomason, there is another Hamiltonian decomposition C1, C2 of H with e in C1 and f in C2. Now we reverse our steps. Restore the vertices of degree 2 and remove the edges e0 and f0. The cycle C1 becomes a path from x0 to xn, and C2 becomes a path from y0 to yn. Neither of these paths is the original X the electronic journal of combinatorics 9 (2002), #N4 3 or Y . Since G has 2n edges and is the edge-disjoint union of these two paths, one of the paths has length at least n. It contains a new path of length n.	communication endpoint;connectivity (graph theory);edge dominating set;final fantasy xi;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);hamiltonian path;like button;multigraph;randomness;thomason collection of civil war tracts	Herbert Fleischner;Robert R.

A graphoidal cover (varPsi ) of G is a collection of paths (not necessary open) in G such that every vertex of G is an internal vertex of at most one path in (varPsi ) and every edge of G is in exactly one path in (varPsi .) The graphoidal covering number (eta ) of G is the minimum cardinality of a graphoidal cover of G.

The minimum degree condition is necessary, and a result of Bollobás and Scott [5] shows that this conjecture holds for regular graphs G (i.e., when ∆(G) = δ(G)). We prove this conjecture for graphs G with ∆(G) ≤ 7 5 δ(G); hence it holds for graphs G with δ(G) ≥ 5 7 |V (G)|.	balanced ternary;bollobás–riordan polynomial;graph (discrete mathematics);vertex (graph theory)	Baogang Xu;Juan Yan;Xingxing Yu	2010	Journal of Graph Theory	10.1002/jgt.20421	combinatorics;degree;mathematics;algorithm;new digraph reconstruction conjecture	Theory	30.489838102263327	28.045357357782933	176396

We show that in the proposed setup, generating such simulator graphs as well as finding the colouring extensions can be computed effectively in polynomial time. We also discuss some applications of this scenario in producing instances of the graph colouring problem near its   phase transition that can be applied in a cryptographic setting.	graph coloring;logic simulation	Amir Daneshgar;Alireza Rahimi;Siamak Taati	2013	Int.

The  k -cube representation of a graph  G  is a mapping of the vertices of  G  to  k -cubes such that the  k -cubes mapped to two vertices in G have a non-empty intersection if and only if the vertices are adjacent. The  cubicity  of a graph  G , denoted as cub( G ), is defined as the minimum dimension  k  such that  G  has a  k -cube representation. An  interval graph  is a graph that can be represented as the intersection of intervals on the real line - i.e., the vertices of an interval graph can be mapped to intervals on the real line such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding intervals overlap. We show that for any interval graph  G  with maximum degree Δ,   cub  (  G  )  ⩽  ⌈  log  Δ  ⌉  +  4  . This upper bound is shown to be tight up to an additive constant of 4 by demonstrating interval graphs for which cubicity is equal to   ⌈  log  Δ  ⌉  .		L. Sunil Chandran;Mathew C.

This graph class generalizes many classes of graphs for which effective kernelization is known to exist, e.g. planar graphs, H-minor free graphs, and H-topological-minor free graphs. We show that for several natural problems on d-degenerate graphs the best known kernelization upper bounds are essentially tight.	degeneracy (graph theory);kernel (operating system)	Marek Cygan;Fabrizio Grandoni;Danny Hermelin	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40450-4_31	strong perfect graph theorem;1-planar graph;pathwidth;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;cograph;universal graph;topology;bidimensionality;graph product;longest path problem;dense graph;pancyclic graph;metric dimension;lévy family of graphs;clique-sum;trapezoid graph;mathematics;maximal independent set;modular decomposition;treewidth;partial k-tree;chordal graph;indifference graph	Theory	25.698795777799837	26.634267159431268	176637

A defect-d matching in a graph G is a matching which covers all but d nodes of G. Graphs which have a defect-d matching haT.re been characterized by Berge I_1 J and 121. A graph is defect-d covered or simply d-covered iiE for each edge e of G, there exists a defect-d matching containing e. A d.efect-0 matching is also called a 1 -factor or perfect matching. An additional characterizatiori for d-covered connectecl bipartite graphs is given in Little et al. [S]. The parity of perfect matchings was also investigated by Little [6] and Kasteleyn [4]. In this paper we will use a device called the matching polynomial o;F a graph, def’med in &.rrell [Yj, in order to derive results about defect-d matchings in some classes of graphs. We will give explicit results for I&(G), the number 0,: defect-d ma’schings, and N,(G), the number of perfect: matchings, in chains (trees with nodes of valencies 1 and 2 only), circuits and basic graphs with cyclomatic number 2. Central to this paper is the paper [3] from which same results will be taken. The lower limits of summations will be zero unless otherwise specified. Upper limits will be omitted when they are obvious from the coatext of the summation.	circuit rank;matching (graph theory);matching polynomial;software bug	E. J.

A representation of these dissections using graphs is presented. The edges are directed and coloured North-South or West-East, and the graph corresponds naturally to the dissection. This representation allowed the exhaustive generation of all dissections up to order 18, using the plantri software. The results were cross-checked by generating all dissections of small sizes using a direct approach. The results confirm, extend and introduce several integer sequences.	quilt	Ed Wynn	2014	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2014.06.022	combinatorics;directed graph;dissection;pure mathematics;mathematics;planar graph	AI	31.885494317307717	31.84833288210415	176798

In the first part of this paper, we study the minimum possible value of |C(G)| over all graphs G of average degree d and girth g. Erdős [8] conjectured that |C(G)| = Ω ( d ) for all such graphs, and we prove this conjecture. In particular, the longest cycle in a graph of average degree d and girth g has length Ω ( d ) . The study of this problem was initiated by Ore in 1967 and our result improves all previously known lower bounds on the length of the longest cycle [7, 11, 21, 24, 25]. Moreover, our bound cannot be improved in general, since known constructions of d-regular Moore Graphs of girth g have roughly that many vertices. We also show that Ω ( d ) is a lower bound for the number of odd cycle lengths in a graph of chromatic number d and girth g. Further results are obtained for the number of cycle lengths in H-free graphs of average degree d. In the second part of the paper, motivated by the conjecture of Erdős and Gyárfás [9] (see also Erdős [10]) that every graph of minimum degree at least three contains a cycle of length a power of two, we prove a general theorem which gives an upper bound on the average degree of an n-vertex graph with no cycle of even length in a prescribed infinite sequence of integers. For many sequences, including the powers of two, our theorem gives the upper bound e ∗n) on the average degree of graph of order n with no cycle of length in the sequence, where logn is the number of times the binary logarithm must be applied to n to get a number which is at most one.	binary logarithm;erdős number;girth (graph theory);graph coloring;power of two;sparse matrix	Benny Sudakov;Jacques Verstraëte	2008	Combinatorica	10.1007/s00493-008-2300-6	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;odd graph;upper and lower bounds;algebra	Theory	30.9357723583987	29.047197262936013	176843

The Square Root problem is that of deciding whether a given graph admits a square root. This problem is only known to be NP-complete for chordal graphs and polynomial-time solvable for non-trivial minor-closed graph classes and a very limited number of other graph classes. We prove that Square Root is O(n)-time solvable for graphs of maximum degree 5 and O(n)-time solvable for graphs of maximum degree at most 6.	decision problem;degree (graph theory);existential quantification;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;np-completeness;polynomial;time complexity	Manfred Cochefert;Jean-François Couturier;Petr A.

We consider a particular upper bound B resulting from a generalization of the greedy coloring algorithm to weighted graphs. To investigate theworst-case performance of this upper bound, we study the graph invariant β(G) = sup x6=0 B(Gx) χf (Gx) . This graph invariant is shown to be equal to the size of the largest star subgraph in the graph.

It is known that graphs have at most O ( 1.7159 n ) minimal dominating sets. In this paper, we establish upper bounds on this maximum number of minimal dominating sets for split graphs, cobipartite graphs and interval graphs. For each of these graph classes, we provide an algorithm to enumerate them. For split and interval graphs, we show that the number of minimal dominating sets is at most 3 n / 3 ? 1.4423 n , which is the best possible bound. This settles a conjecture by Couturier et al. (SOFSEM 2012, 1).

We prove that the minimum number of colors needed to color the set of all directed paths in T, so that two paths of the same color never use the same directed arc of T, is equal to the maximum number of different paths that contain the same arc of T. The proof implies a polynomial time algorithm for actually coloring the paths with the minimum number of colors. When only a subset of the directed paths is to be colored, the problem is known to be NP-complete; we describe certain instances of the problem which can be efficiently solved. These results are applied to WDM (wavelength-division multiplexing) routing in all-optical networks. In particular, we solve the all-to-all gossiping problem in optical networks. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

If $G$ has a perfect matching $M$nwhose anti-forcing number attains this upper bound, then we say $G$ is annextremal graph and $M$ is a nice perfect matching. We obtain an equivalentncondition for the nice perfect matchings of $G$ and establish a one-to-onencorrespondence between the nice perfect matchings and the edge-involutions ofn$G$, which are the automorphisms $alpha$ of order two such that $v$ andn$alpha(v)$ are adjacent for every vertex $v$. We demonstrate that all extremalngraphs can be constructed from $K_2$ by implementing two expansion operations,nand $G$ is extremal if and only if one factor in a Cartesian decomposition ofn$G$ is extremal. As examples, we have that all perfect matchings of thencomplete graph $K_{2n}$ and the complete bipartite graph $K_{n, n}$ are nice.nAlso we show that the hypercube $Q_n$, the folded hypercube $FQ_n$ ($ngeq4$)nand the enhanced hypercube $Q_{n, k}$ ($0leq kleq n-4$) have exactly $n$,n$n+1$ and $n+1$ nice perfect matchings respectively.

bd4845983828cb22c5782b52f8943f71dc3651ba	three theorems regarding testing graph properties	graph properties;property testing;np;monotone properties	Property testing is a relaxation of decision problems in which it is required to distinguish YES-instances (i.e., objects having a predetermined property) from instances that are far from any YES-instance. We presents three theorems regarding testing graph properties in the adjacency matrix representation. More specifically, these theorems relate to the project of characterizing graph properties according to the complexity of testing them (in the adjacency matrix representation). The first theorem is that there exist monotone graph properties in for which testing is very hard (i.e., requires to examine a constant fraction of the entries in the matrix). The second theorem is that every graph property that can be tested making a number of queries that is independent of the size of the graph can be so tested by uniformly selecting a set of vertices and accepting iff the induced subgraph has some fixed graph property (which is not necessarily the same as the one being tested). The third theorem refers to the framework of graph partition problems, and is a characterization of the subclass of properties that can be tested using a one-sided error tester making a number of queries that is independent of the size of the graph. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

For an even integer or odd prime power q, we prove that ex(q2 + q + 2, C4) < 1 2 (q + 1)(q2 + q + 2), which leads to an improvement of the upper bound on Ramsey numbers R(C4, Wq2+2), where Wn is a wheel of order n. By using a simple polarity graph Gq for a prime power q, we construct the graphs whose complements do not contain K1,m or Wm , and then determine some exact values of R(C4, K1,m) and R(C4, Wm). In particular, we prove that R(C4, K1,q2−2) = q2 + q − 1 for q ≥ 3, R(C4, Wq2−1) = q2 + q − 1 for q ≥ 5, and R(C4, Wq2+2) = q2 + q + 2 for q ≥ 7.	complement (complexity);ramsey's theorem;wheels	Yali Wu;Yongqi Sun;Rui Zhang;Stanislaw P.

The motivation for undertaking such a study comes from recent positive results on this topic. For example: Bourke et al. [2009] isolate a directed path in planar graphs and subsequently Datta et al. [2010b] isolate a perfect matching in bipartite planar graphs. Our first observation is that sufficiently strong (and plausible) isolations for certain structures in planar graphs would have strong consequences such as: NL ⊆ ⊕L, Bipartite-Matching ∈ NC, and NP ⊆ ⊕P. Our second observation is that although we do not yet have such strong isolations for arbitrary planar graphs, we do have them for bipartite planar graphs, that is, non-bipartiteness is the main bottleneck.	graph (discrete mathematics);matching (graph theory);nl (complexity);path (graph theory);planar graph	Raghav Kulkarni	2011	TOCT	10.1145/2003685.2003687	strong perfect graph theorem;1-planar graph;outerplanar graph;apollonian network;pathwidth;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;robertson–seymour theorem;topology;bipartite graph;longest path problem;dense graph;metric dimension;nowhere-zero flow;planar straight-line graph;clique-sum;mathematics;maximal independent set;chordal graph;indifference graph;book embedding;planar graph	Theory	26.3207212647895	27.549197313671204	179545

A ,B-Iabeling (or graceful labeling) of G yields a cyclic decomposition of K2n+1 only. It is well-known that certain classes of trees do not have a-Iabelings. In this article, we introduce the concept of a near a-labeling of a bipartite graph, and prove that if a graph G with n edges has a near a-labeling, then there is a cyclic G-decomposition of both Kn,n and K2nx+1 for all positive integers x. We conjecture that all trees have a near a-labeling and show that certain classes of trees which are known not to have an a-labeling have a near a-labeling.	graceful labeling	Saad El-Zanati;M. J.

On this basis, a new graph distance metric is proposed for measuring similarities between objects represented by attributed relational graphs. The proposed metric can be computed by a straightforward extension of any algorithm that implements error-correcting graph matching, when run under an appropriate cost function, and the extension only takes time linear in the size of the graphs.	algorithm;computation;distance (graph theory);error detection and correction;loss function;matching (graph theory);pattern recognition	Mirtha Lina Fernández Venero;Gabriel Valiente	2001	Pattern Recognition Letters		degeneracy;claw-free graph;block graph;graph power;split graph;factor-critical graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;cograph;universal graph;error detection and correction;edit distance;bipartite graph;metric;computer science;clique-width;forbidden graph characterization;pattern recognition;subgraph isomorphism problem;graph factorization;mathematics;distance-hereditary graph;tree-depth;induced subgraph isomorphism problem;graph homomorphism;butterfly graph;graph operations;line graph;statistics;matching	Vision	26.449036517568445	27.044483505983397	180336

172904ded1e5d3955a176e5fc7aee353cf031d2b	on the oriented chromatic index of oriented graphs		A homomorphism from an oriented graph G to an oriented graph H is a mapping φ from the set of vertices of G to the set of vertices of H such that −−−−−→ φ(u)φ(v) is an arc in H whenever −→ uv is an arc in G. The oriented chromatic index of an oriented graph G is the minimum number of vertices in an oriented graph H such that there exists a homomorphism from the line digraph LD(G) of G to H (the line digraph LD(G) of G is given by V(LD(G)) = A(G) and −→ ab ∈ A(LD(G)) whenever a = −→uv and b = −→ vw). We give upper bounds for the oriented chromatic index of graphs with bounded acyclic chromatic number, of planar graphs and of graphs with bounded degree. We also consider lower and upper bounds of oriented chromatic number in terms of oriented chromatic index. We finally prove that the problem of deciding whether an oriented graph has oriented chromatic index at most k is polynomial time solvable if k ≤ 3 and is NPcomplete if k ≥ 4. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this paper, we show that the minimum coloring game on a perfect graph has a stable core if and only if every vertex of the graph belongs to a maximum clique. We also consider the problem on the core largeness, the extendability, and the exactness of minimum coloring games.	clique (graph theory);edge dominating set;extensibility;game theory;graph coloring	Thomas Bietenhader;Yoshio Okamoto	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30559-0_33	game theory;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;fractional coloring;perfect graph;graph theory;complete coloring;edge coloring;vertex;mathematics;list coloring;greedy coloring;algorithm	Theory	27.681102394169788	26.44501035802345	180489

In an instance of on-line graph coloring, the nodes are presented one at a time. As each node is presented, its edges to previously presented nodes are also given. Each node must be assigned a color, different from the colors of its neighbors, before the next node is given. LetA(G) be the number of colors used by algorithmA on a graphG and letx(G) be the chromatic number ofG. The performance ratio of an on-line graph coloring algorithm for a class of graphsC is maxG ∈C(A(G)/χ(G)). We consider the class ofd-inductive graphs. A graphG isd-inductive if the nodes ofG can be numbered so that each node has at mostd edges to higher-numbered nodes. In particular, planar graphs are 5-inductive, and chordal graphs arex(G)-inductive. First Fit is the algorithm that assigns each node the lowest-numbered color possible. We show that ifG isd-inductive, then First Fit usesO(d logn) colors onG. This yields an upper bound ofo(logn) on the performance ratio of First Fit on chordal and planar graphs. First Fit does as well as any on-line algorithm ford-inductive graphs: we show that, for anyd and any on-line graph coloring algorithmA, there is ad-inductive graph that forcesA to use Ω(d logn) colors to colorG. We also examine on-line graph coloring with lookahead. An algorithm is on-line with lookaheadl, if it must color nodei after examining only the firstl+i nodes. We show that, forl<n/logn, the lower bound ofd logn colors still holds.	color;graph coloring;inductive reasoning;line graph;online algorithm;online and offline;parsing;planar graph	Sandy Irani	1994	Algorithmica	10.1007/BF01294263	outerplanar graph;block graph;graph power;factor-critical graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;interval graph;topology;fractional coloring;complete coloring;edge coloring;cubic graph;graph coloring;mathematics;voltage graph;distance-hereditary graph;windmill graph;upper and lower bounds;butterfly graph;list coloring;graph minor;line graph;coxeter graph;planar graph;friendship graph	Theory	24.939913501747224	26.125068879988582	181244

30d3187fee6edcdd082fb9c5641479f6ebf75273	on the concrete categories of graphs		In the standard Category of Graphs, the graphs allow only one edge to be incident to any two vertices, not necessarily distinct, and the graph morphisms must map edges to edges and vertices to vertices while preserving incidence. We refer to these graph morphisms as Strict Morphisms. We relax the condition on the graphs allowing any number of edges to be incident to any two vertices, as well as relaxing the condition on graph morphisms by allowing edges to be mapped to vertices, provided that incidence is still preserved. We call this broader graph category The Category of Conceptual Graphs, and define four other graph categories created by combinations of restrictions of the graph morphisms as well as restrictions on the allowed graphs. We investigate which Lawvere axioms for the category of Sets and Functions apply to each of these Categories of Graphs, as well as the other categorial constructions of free objects, projective objects, generators, and their categorial duals.	categorial grammar;category theory;combinatory categorial grammar;conceptual graph;incidence matrix;naive bayes classifier;peano axioms;vertex (geometry)	D.

Let S(v) denote the sum of labels over all neighbors of the vertex v in G. A labeling f of G is called lucky if $${S(u) \neq S(v),}$$ for every pair of adjacent vertices u and v. Also, for each vertex $${v \in V(G),}$$ let L(v) denote a list of natural numbers available at v. A list lucky labeling, is a lucky labeling f such that $${f(v) \in L(v),}$$ for each $${v \in V(G).}$$ A graph G is said to be lucky k-choosable if every k-list assignment of natural numbers to the vertices of G permits a list lucky labeling of G. The lucky choice number of G, ? l (G), is the minimum natural number k such that G is lucky k-choosable. In this paper, we prove that for every graph G with $${\Delta \geq 2, \eta_{l}(G) \leq \Delta^2-\Delta + 1,}$$ where Δ denotes the maximum degree of G. Among other results we show that for every 3-list assignment to the vertices of a forest, there is a list lucky labeling which is a proper vertex coloring too.		Saieed Akbari;Maryam Ghanbari;R.

We establish a close relation to the previously studied problem of minimum H -decompositions, where an edge coloring does not matter and one is merely interested in decomposing graphs into copies of H and single edges.

A clique is strongly bisimplicial if its neighborhood is partitioned into two cliques which are mutually non-adjacent and a clique-strip is a sequence of cliques {H0, . . . , Hp} with the property that Hi is adjacent only to Hi−1 and Hi+1. By exploiting such a structure we show how to solve the Maximum Weight Stable Set Problem in such a graph in time O(|V | √ |E|), improving the previous complexity bound of O(|V ||E|).	algorithm;graph (discrete mathematics)	Paolo Nobili;Antonio Sassano	2015	CoRR		independent set;topology;claw;graph;mathematics	ML	25.472172788467	26.019965045148265	183434

This conjecture is still open. We consider a variant of the conjecture, where instead of excluding H as an induced subgraph, both H and H are excluded. We prove this modified conjecture for the case when H is the five-edge path. Our second main result is an asymmetric version of this: we prove that for every graph G such that G contains no induced six-edge path, and G contains no induced four-edge path, G contains a polynomial-size clique or stable set.	erdős number;erdős–hajnal conjecture;induced subgraph;polynomial	Maria Chudnovsky;Paul D.

For many interconnection networks, the optimal sets are precisely those incident to a single vertex. Recently, the conditional matching preclusion number of a graph was introduced to look for obstruction sets beyond those incident to a single vertex. It is defined to be the minimum number of edges whose deletion results in a graph with no isolated vertices that has neither perfect matchings nor almost-perfect matchings. In this paper, we find this number and classify all optimal sets for the augmented cubes, a class of networks designed as an improvement of the hypercubes.	cubes;matching preclusion	Eddie Cheng;Randy Jia;David Lu	2010	Journal of Interconnection Networks	10.1142/S0219265910002726	factor-critical graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;cycle graph;mathematics;blossom algorithm;matching	Vision	27.242636754402643	27.737686836730884	185959

It is based on the substitution of a single node in a nodeand edge-labeled graph by an arbitrary graph, explicitly assigning new endpoints to the edges incident to the replaced node. For these graph rewriting systems, we are interested in the subgraph-matching problem. We show that the problem is NP-complete, even on graphs that are stars. As a positive result, we give an algorithm which is polynomial if both rules and query graph, have bounded degree and bounded cut size. We demonstrate that molecular graphs of practically relevant molecules in drug discovery conform with this property. The algorithm is not a fixed-parameter algorithm. Indeed, we show that the problem is W[1]-hard on trees in the degree as the parameter.	algorithm;algorithm engineering;connected component (graph theory);database;graph labeling;graph rewriting;karp's 21 np-complete problems;matching (graph theory);max-flow min-cut theorem;maximal set;molecular graph;parameterized complexity;polynomial;sipser–lautemann theorem;subgraph isomorphism problem;time complexity	Ernst Althaus;Andreas Hildebrandt;Domenico Mosca	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-74730-9_5	mathematics;bounded function;graph rewriting;polynomial;algorithm;stars;graph	Theory	25.0766490673453	25.562799747158987	187258

For a total-k-coloring of G, let ∑ c(v) denote the total sum of colors of the edges incident with v and the color of v. If for each edge uv ∈ E(G), ∑ c(u) = ∑ c(v), then we call such a total-k-coloring neighbor sum distinguishing. The least number k needed for such a coloring of G is the neighbor sum distinguishing total chromatic number, denoted by χ ′′ (G). Pilśniak andWoźniak conjectured χ ′′ (G) ≤ (G) + 3 for any simple graph with maximum degree (G). In this paper, we prove that for any planar graph G with maximum degree (G), ch ′′ (G) ≤ max{ (G) + 3, 16}, where ch ′′ (G) is the neighbor sum distinguishing total choosability of G.	color;degree (graph theory);graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;list coloring;planar graph;total coloring	Cunquan Qu;Guanghui Wang;Guiying Yan;Xiaowei Yu	2016	J.

It turns out that for some classes of matrices defined by a graph the 3-colorability problem is equivalent to deciding whether the class defined by the graph contains a matrix of rank 3 or not. This implies the NP-hardness of determining the minimum rank of a matrix in such a class. Finally we give for any class of matrices defined by a graph that is interesting in this respect a reduction of the 3-colorability problem to the problem of deciding whether or not this class contains a matrix of rank equal to three.	graph coloring	René Peeters	1996	Combinatorica	10.1007/BF01261326	graph power;circuit rank;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;universal graph;graph bandwidth;null graph;graph property;perfect graph;foster graph;mathematics;tree-depth;incidence matrix;windmill graph;critical graph;graph;graph homomorphism;butterfly graph;rank;finite field;complement graph;line graph;coxeter graph;adjacency matrix;friendship graph;algebra	Theory	31.005851521215305	30.301726693178473	187594
1fbf20517bc4e9f149559dd7975eda29961156e4	zero forcing, tree width, and graph coloring		We show that certain types of zero-forcing sets for a graph give rise to chordal supergraphs and hence to proper colorings. Zero-forcing was originally defined to provide a bound for matrix minimum rank problems [1], but is interesting as a graph-theoretic notion in its own right [5], and has applications to mathematical physics, such as quantum systems [3]. There are different flavors of zero-forcing, many corresponding to a minimum rank graph parameter, and each is typically defined via assignments of the colors black and white to vertices and a color-change rule that allows changing white vertices to black [2]; the associated zero-forcing number is then the smallest cardinality among sets of vertices that when colored black originally allow the entire graph to become colored black via (repeated) application of the color-change rule (zero-forcing sets). Barioli et al. [2] showed that even treewidth can be defined as a zero-forcing parameter. Their proof uses a characterization of treewidth involving the game of cops and robbers. In this paper, we will show that a treewidth zero-forcing set Z for a graph G can be used to directly construct a |Z|-tree on the vertices of G that contains G as a subgraph. As an application, we will see that many different types of zero-forcing sets give easy constructions of proper colorings and proper list-colorings. For a given coloring of the vertices of a graph using black and white, the treewidth color-change rule was defined as follows (standard definitions are taken from Diestel’s Graph Theory [4]): Definition. Let B be the set consisting of all the black vertices. Let W1, . . . ,Wk be the sets of vertices of the k components of G−B. For each component i, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, let Ci ⊆ B be the subset of black vertices that are considered to be active with regard to that component, where initially each Ci = B. If w ∈ Wi and for each component X of G[Wi] − w there is a vertex uX ∈ Ci with no white neighbor in G[VX ∪ B], then change the color of w to black and associate to each connected component X of G[Wi]− w a new active set equal to (Ci − uX) ∪ {w}. L. MITCHELL /AUSTRALAS. J. COMBIN. 61 (1) (2015), 19–22 20 When this color-change rule is applied, we will say that the uX vertices force w and the uX vertices and w together comprise a forcing. In studying treewidth zero-forcing sets, we will find it advantageous to keep track of active sets for each vertex as well as the progress of the color-changes. If Z is a treewidth zero-forcing set of a graph G and m = |G − Z|, let w1, . . . , wm be the vertices of G − Z in the order in which they are turned black (there may be more than one such order – we’ll pick one). Our notational scheme will be subscripts that refer to the progress of the forcing: a subscript i, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, will reference the state of things after i forces, that is, when wi has become black and (if i < m) wi+1 is still white. For example, let B0 = Z and recursively define, for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, Bi = Bi−1 ∪ {wi}. Then Bi is the set of black vertices after i forces. Continuing in this spirit, if u is a vertex of G − Bj for some j with 0 ≤ j ≤ m − 1, let C j be the connected component of G−Bj containing u and let Aj be the set of active vertices of C j . Proposition. Let Z be a treewidth zero-forcing set of a graphG and use the notation above. Let G0 be the graph obtained from G by adding edges between any two vertices of B0 that are not adjacent in G. Let Gi be the graph obtained from Gi−1 by adding edges between wi and any vertices of A wi i−1 that are not neighbors of wi in Gi. Then Gm is a |Z|-tree on the same vertices as G containing G as a subgraph. Moreover, Z is a treewidth zero-forcing set for Gm with the same forcings in the same order. Proof. Since no vertices are added and no edges are removed, G is a subgraph of Gm and they share the same vertex set. To prove that Gm is a |Z|-tree, we will use the recursive definition of k-tree. Specifically, we claim that for each i with 1 ≤ i ≤ m, each Gi[Bi] is a |Z|-tree and that Gi[Bi] is obtained from Gi−1[Bi−1] by adding the vertex wi, which is adjacent in Gi[Bi] to the vertices of a |Z|-clique in Gi−1[Bi−1]. We begin by collecting some useful facts. First, active sets (for both vertices and components) start with |Z| vertices and only change via a one-for-one swap of vertices, so |Ai i−1| = |Z| for each i. Let N(w) denote the set of neighbors of vertex w in G. We next claim that N(wi) ∩ Bi−1 ⊆ Ai i−1 for each i with 1 ≤ i ≤ m. To see this, suppose that v ∈ N(wi) ∩ Bi−1. There are two possibilities: either v ∈ B0, in which case v ∈ Ai 0 , or v / ∈ B0, meaning v = wj for some j < i. In the latter case, since wi and v = wj are adjacent in G, Ci j−1 = C wj j−1, and so v = wj ∈ Ai j due to the jth force. Either way, v is at some point an active vertex for wi. Suppose v / ∈ Ai i−1. Then for some k < i (and k > j if v = wj), v was uX for X = C wi k , but this contradicts that v ∈ N(wi) since wi would be a white neighbor of v in G[VX ∪Bk−1]. Thus v ∈ Ai i−1. Finally, we claim that for i and j such that 0 ≤ i < j ≤ m, each A i forms a clique in each Gk such that 0 ≤ k < j. First, note that A0 consists of the vertices of Z, which form a clique in G0 by definition. Assume then that 0 < i < j ≤ m and the vertices of the set A wj i−1 form a clique in Gi−1. If A wj i−1 = A wj i , the vertices of A wj i will still be a clique in Gi. If A wj i−1 = A i , then wi ∈ C i−1. Thus Ci i−1 = C i−1, which L. MITCHELL /AUSTRALAS. J. COMBIN. 61 (1) (2015), 19–22 21 by the definition of the active sets for vertices implies Ai i−1 = A wj i−1. By assumption, Ai i−1 is a clique in Gi−1. By construction, A wi i−1 ∪ {wi} is a clique in Gi, and, by definition, A wj i ⊂ Ai i−1 ∪ {wi}, so that A i is also a clique in Gi. The claim follows by induction. To start the induction for the main part of the proof, notice that G0 is a |Z|-clique in G0[B0] = G0 by construction, that A w1 0 = B0 by definition, and thus w1 ∈ B1 is adjacent in G1[B1] to the vertices of G0 by construction. Thus G1[B1] is a |Z|-tree. Suppose now that Gj[Bj ] is a |Z|-tree for some j with 1 ≤ j < m. By construction, the vertices of Gj+1[Bj+1] are those of Gj [Bj] and the vertex wj+1, which by construction and the second fact above is adjacent to exactly the vertices of A wj+1 j in Gj+1[Bj+1]. By the first fact above, |A j | = |Z|, and by the third and final fact above, Gj[A wj+1 j ] is a clique. Thus Gj+1[Bj+1] is a |Z|-tree. By induction, Gm = Gm[Bm] is a |Z|-tree. We also claim that Z is a zero-forcing set of Gm using the same forces. The only way this can fail to be true is if an edge is added to G that will cause the color-change rule to no longer be applicable at some point. We will show this cannot happen. Consider a vertex z that is the uX vertex for a connected component X of G− Bi for some i such that 0 ≤ i < m. If an edge is added between z and a vertex that is in Bi, that edge does not affect the ability of z to be uX . Thus we only need consider an edge added between z and some wj where j > i. If C wj i = X , then the edge to wj does not affect the ability of z to be uX . If C wj i = X, then z is replaced by wi in A wj i . A vertex that has become inactive for another vertex can never become active again, so z / ∈ A i contradicts that z = uX , since z = uX implies z ∈ Ai i−1. In the hierarchy of color-change rules, the treewidth color-change rule is among the least restrictive. In particular, it is clear from the article by Barioli et al. [2] that, among others, standard zero-forcing sets and positive semidefinite zero-forcing sets are also treewidth zero-forcing sets. As an application of our proposition, many types of zero-forcing sets thus give proper colorings as in the following corollary: Corollary. If G is a graph with a treewidth zero-forcing set Z, where the vertices of G − Z are w1, . . . , wm in the order they are forced, given an assignment of a list of |Z|+ 1 colors to each vertex, a proper list-coloring of G may be selected by first choosing a proper list-coloring of G[Z] then selecting an available color from the list of each wi in order. Proof. A proper list-coloring of G[Z] exists since |G[Z]| < |Z|+1, and from the proof of the proposition, each wi will be adjacent to at most |Z| vertices whose colors have already been selected when its turn arrives. Remark. The treewidth color-change rule is significantly different from the original zero-forcing color-change rule in that its application requires knowledge of more than the graph and which vertices are black. We would be very interested to know if it possible to define a color-change rule that depends only on the graph and which vertices are black that will also give treewidth as its zero-forcing number.

It is shown that these obvious necessary conditions are also sufficient when G is any simple graph having minimum degree at least ( 32 + on(1))n, where n is the number of vertices in G. This improves the bound given by Gustavsson (1991), who showed (as part of a more general result) sufficiency for simple graphs with minimum degree at least (1−10+on(1))n. On the other hand, it is known that for arbitrarily large values of n there exist simple graphs satisfying the obvious necessary conditions, having n vertices and minimum degree 3 5n− 1, but having no decomposition into edge-disjoint 4-cycles. We also show that if G is a bipartite simple graph with n vertices in each part, then the obvious necessary conditions for G to decompose into 4-cycles are sufficient when G has minimum degree at least ( 32 + on(1))n.	degree (graph theory);existential quantification;graph (discrete mathematics);vertex (geometry)	Darryn E.

An  x  −  y  path in  G  is called a rainbow path, if there are no two edges with the same color in this path. An edge  k -coloring  c  is called rainbow  k -coloring, if for any two distinct vertices  x  and  y  in  V ( G ), there is an  x  −  y  rainbow path. The rainbow connection number, denoted by  rc ( G ), is the smallest positive integer  k  such that  G  has a rainbow  k -coloring.

There are very few number of articles where were worked on the relationship between radius or diameter and Wiener index. In this paper, we give an upper bound on Wiener index of trees and graphs in terms of number of vertices n, radius r , and characterize the extremal graphs.

However, its performance is only partially understood. Improving our understanding of the sum of squares hierarchy is a major open problem in computational complexity theory. A key component of analyzing the sum of squares hierarchy is understanding the behavior of certain matrices whose entries are random but not independent. For these matrices, there is a random input graph and each entry of the matrix is a low degree function of the edges of this input graph. Moreoever, these matrices are generally invariant (as a function of the input graph) when we permute the vertices of the input graph. In this paper, we bound the norms of all such matrices up to a polylogarithmic factor. 1998 ACM Subject Classification G.2.2 Graph Theory	combinatorial optimization;computational complexity theory;graph theory;mathematical optimization;polylogarithmic function;sum-of-squares optimization;the matrix	Dhruv Medarametla;Aaron Potechin	2016		10.4230/LIPIcs.APPROX-RANDOM.2016.40	graph power;graph energy;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;directed graph;graph bandwidth;level structure;null graph;graph property;degree;regular graph;mathematics;voltage graph;quartic graph;complement graph;matrix addition;strength of a graph;adjacency matrix;algebra	Theory	26.838092027322993	26.11021862369483	194949

Motivated by this conjecture, we raise the problem to a higher level by introducing a transversal game in hypergraphs. We define the game transversal number, τg(H), of a hypergraph H, and prove that if every edge of H has size at least 2, and H C4, then τg(H) ≤ 4 11 (nH + mH ), where nH and mH denote the number of vertices and edges, respectively, in H. Further, we characterize the hypergraphs achieving equality in this bound. As an application of this result, we prove that if G is a graph on n vertices with minimum degree at least 2, then γtg(G) < 8 11n. As a consequence of this result, the 34 -Game Total Domination Conjecture is true over the class of graphs with minimum degree at least 2.	combinatorica;dominating set;graph (discrete mathematics);vertex (geometry)	Csilla Bujtás;Michael A.

Based on recent results of Nagle, Schacht and the authors, we give here solutions to these problems. In particular, we prove the following: Let F be a k-uniform hypergraph on t vertices and suppose an n-vertex k-uniform hypergraph H contains only o(n) copies of F .

9ced861774dc4317a04c4ed999f7d1151d31de34	nonrepetitive colouring via entropy compression		A vertex colouring of a graph is nonrepetitive if there is no path whose first half receives the same sequence of colours as the second half. A graph is nonrepetitively l-choosable if given lists of at least l colours at each vertex, there is a nonrepetitive colouring such that each vertex is coloured from its own list. It is known that, for some constant c, every graph with maximum degree ∆ is c∆-choosable. We prove this result with c = 1 (ignoring lower order terms). We then prove that every subdivision of a graph with sufficiently many division vertices per edge is nonrepetitively 5-choosable. The proofs of both these results are based on the Moser-Tardos entropy-compression method, and a recent extension by Grytczuk, Kozik and Micek for the nonrepetitive choosability of paths. Finally we prove that graphs with pathwidth θ are nonrepetitively O(θ)-colourable.	color;degree (graph theory);entropy compression;graph coloring;list coloring;moser spindle;pathwidth;subdivision surface	Vida Dujmovic;Gwenaël Joret;David R.

To study the connectivity and structure of the graph, strongly connected component (SCC) analysis is important. When the graph contains hundreds of millions of nodes and billions of edges, it's difficult to use traditional algorithm because of the intractability for both time and space. In this paper, we investigate some properties of web graph, and propose a feasible algorithm for enumerating its SCCs.	algorithm;source code control system;webgraph	Jie Han;Yong Yu;Guowei Liu;Gui-Rong Xue	2005		10.1007/978-3-540-31849-1_64	transpose graph;directed graph;null graph;graph property;graph labeling;computer science;regular graph;theoretical computer science;simplex graph;multigraph;aperiodic graph;voltage graph;distance-hereditary graph;biconnected graph;graph;butterfly graph;complement graph;strongly connected component;graph database;line graph;strength of a graph	Graphics	24.67988135707615	28.86648498453678	196493

The distinguishing chromatic number of G is the smallest integer k such that G has a distinguishing labeling that is at the same time a proper vertex coloring. The distinguishing chromatic number of the Cartesian product Kk Kn is determined for all k and n. In most of the cases it is equal to the chromatic number, thus answering a question of Choi, Hartke and Kaul whether there are some other graphs for which this equality holds.	cartesian closed category;graph coloring	Janja Jerebic;Sandi Klavzar	2010	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2009.11.021	brooks' theorem;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;star;edge coloring;graph automorphism;graph coloring;cartesian product;mathematics;windmill graph;critical graph;complete graph	Theory	30.595186813106377	30.136621179667785	196719
59b942c83d6201cab67a587a4e0fb75e4c2a7e99	packing trees of bounded diameter into the complete graph		Let d be a positive integer. We prove that there exists a constant c = c(d) such that if T1, . . . , Tn is a sequence of trees such that |V (Ti)| = i, diam(Ti) ≤ d + 2, and there exists xi ∈ V (Ti) such that Ti−xi has at least (1− c)(i− 1) isolated vertices, then T1, . . . , Tn can be packed into Kn. This verifies a special case of the Tree Packing Conjecture. We then prove that if T is a tree of order n +1 and there exists x ∈ V (T ) such that T−x has at least n− √ n/8 isolated vertices, then 2n + 1 copies of T may be packed into K2n+1. Finally, we show that there exists a constant c′ = c′(d) such that if T is a tree of order n + 1, diam(T ) ≤ d + 2, and there exists x ∈ V (T ) such that T − x has at least (1− c′)n isolated vertices, then 2n+1 copies of T may be packed into K2n+1.

Measuring the isomorphisms between hyper graphs straightforwardly tends to be elusive since a hyper graph may exhibit varying relational orders. We thus transform a hyper graph into a directed line graph. This not only accurately reflects the multiple relationships exhibited by the hyper graph but is also easier to manipulate isomorphism tests. To locate the isomorphisms between hyper graphs through their directed line graphs, we propose a new directed Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test for directed graphs. The new isomorphism test precisely reflects the structure of the directed edges. By identifying the isomorphic substructures of directed graphs, the hyper graph kernel for a pair of hyper graphs is computed by counting the number of pair wise isomorphic substructures from their directed line graphs. We show that our kernel limits tottering that arises in the existing walk and sub tree based (hyper)graph kernels. Experiments on challenging (hyper)graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our kernel.	algorithm;directed graph;graph kernel;kernel (operating system);line graph;tree (data structure)	Lu Bai;Peng Ren;Edwin R.

93b4eda093e22049e6ba18adcafbca76ac9b4848	about skew partitions in minimal imperfect graphs	stable set	For terms not defined here, the reader is referred to [6]. For a graph G=(V, E), we denote by G the complement of G. We use |(G) to denote the size of a largest clique in G and :(G) to denote the size of a largest stable set in G, or simply | and : when no confusion is possible. A graph G is said to be perfect if, for each induced subgraph H of G, H can be coloured with |(H) colours such that every two adjacent vertices have different colours. A graph is minimal imperfect if it is not perfect but all of its proper induced subgraphs are perfect. One can easily check that an odd chordless cycle with at least five vertices (usually called an odd hole) and its complement (usually called an odd antihole) are minimal imperfect graphs. Berge [1] conjectured that the only minimal imperfect graphs are the odd holes and the odd antiholes. This conjecture is still unsettled and known as the strong perfect graph conjecture (SPGC). Berge also conjectured that a graph is perfect if and only if its complement is perfect. This conjecture is a consequence of the following theorem of Lova sz [9]:	clique (graph theory);color;induced path;induced subgraph;neighbourhood (graph theory);strong perfect graph theorem	Florian Roussel;P.

In this paper we study the kk-coloring problem for (Pt,Cl)(Pt,Cl)-free graphs. Bruce et al. (2009), and Maffray and Morel (2012) have proved that 3-colorability of P5P5-free graphs has a finite forbidden induced subgraphs characterization, while Hoang et al. (2015) have shown that kk-colorability of P5P5-free graphs for k≥4k≥4 does not. These authors have also shown, aided by a computer search, that 4-colorability of (P5,C5)(P5,C5)-free graphs does have a finite forbidden induced subgraph characterization.#R##N##R##N#We prove that for any k≥1k≥1, the kk-colorability of (P6,C4)(P6,C4)-free graphs has a finite forbidden induced subgraph characterization. For k=3k=3 and k=4k=4, we provide the full lists of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs. As an application, we obtain certifying polynomial time algorithms for 3-coloring and 4-coloring (P6,C4)(P6,C4)-free graphs. (Polynomial time algorithms have been previously obtained by Golovach, Paulusma, and Song, but those algorithms are not certifying.) To complement these results we show that in most other cases the kk-coloring problem for (Pt,Cl)(Pt,Cl)-free graphs is NP-complete. Specifically, we prove that the kk-coloring problem is NP-complete for (Pt,Cl)(Pt,Cl)-free graphs when #R##N#–#TAB##R##N#l=5l=5, k≥4k≥4, and t≥7t≥7.#R##N##R##N#–#TAB##R##N#l≥6l≥6, k≥5k≥5, and t≥6t≥6.#R##N##R##N#–#TAB##R##N#l≥6l≥6 but l≠7l≠7, k=4k=4, and t≥7t≥7.#R##N##R##N#–#TAB##R##N#l≥6l≥6 but l≠9l≠9, k=4k=4, and t≥9t≥9.#R##N##R##N##R##N#Our results almost completely classify the complexity for the cases when k≥4,l≥4k≥4,l≥4, and identify the last few open cases.	complexity;graph coloring	Pavol Hell;Shenwei Huang	2017	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2015.10.024	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;np-complete;longest path problem;mathematics;chordal graph;indifference graph;algorithm	Theory	28.27235587225905	26.99150564166832	197521

We shall denote by K&I, q) the pentagram whose periphery bears color p and whose diagonals bear color q. A triangle-free 3-colored K,, can be obtained by joining together a vertex a0 with K,(O, l), K,(l, 2), and K,(2,0), and suitably coloring the new edges. In [3] it was shown that there are exactly two non-isomorphic K,,‘s and either of them can be obtained in this way. One of these colorings (which we call “untwisted”) was discovered with the aid of field theory, and the other (which we call “twisted”) by a computer search. Later, Chung [ 1 ] showed that the systematic pattern of connections in the untwisted K,, could be generalized, and thus she imposed a lower bound on the number of vertices in a maximal triangle-free k-colored complete graph, for any k; at present, Chung’s result provides the best known lower bound for k = 4, although Fredericksen [2] has found a better bound for k = 5. 120 0095-8956/88 $3.00	graph coloring;maximal set;monochrome;pentagram;quantum field theory;search algorithm;twisted	Charles Laywine;J.

f420ece85152cf3d93f0f8ed559db0b54ee8b899	a polynomial time algorithm for counting the number of independent sets of cactus graphs		Counting the number of independent sets of a graph G (denoted as NI(G)) is a classical #P-complete problem for graphs of degree greater or equal than 3. However, there are classes of graphs which according to its topology can be computed in polynomial time. In this paper, we present a polynomial time algorithm for counting the number of independent sets on a special class of graphs called cactus graphs. Our algorithm is based on previous results for counting the number of independent sets on unicyclic graphs.
