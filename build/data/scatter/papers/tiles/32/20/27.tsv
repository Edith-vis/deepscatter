87742ee405762d9617fd1de1a66434628c5cfa08	performance analysis of adaptive polarized mimo pre-rake combined transmit diversity system in fdd	combined transmit diversity;polarization diversity;mimo;pre rake combiner	In this paper, an advanced closed loop Polarized Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Pre-RAKE Combined Transmit Diversity “Pol MIMO Pre-RAKE CTD” system is proposed for the downlink. The proposed system is designed and analyzed in frequency division duplex mode. The numerical results demonstrate that it can achieve a significant performance gain, especially for dense urban and suburban environments. This is in addition to simplifying the receiver structure of the mobile terminal as well as reducing its power consumption and the spatial dimension of the MIMO system. For the same spatial dimension, the proposed system will be compared with the adaptive polarized MIMO Pre-RAKE system, employing selection transmit diversity technique. Both systems will be investigated for various transmit diversity degrees in the Node B and under different numbers of users. Also, the performance will be studied using both random and orthogonal spreading codes between users. The effect of the cross-polarization discrimination on the Bit Error Rate performance will be discussed. Moreover, a performance comparison will be presented in case of using both nonoverlapped and orthogonal carriers between the Pre-RAKEs. Finally, the proposed system will be examined under different numbers of channel paths and Pre-RAKE fingers.	bit error rate;code;comparative toxicogenomics database (ctd);duplex (telecommunications);frequency divider;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);mimo;mimo-ofdm;mobile phone;numerical analysis;offset binary;polarization (waves);process gain;profiling (computer programming);rake;std bus;telecommunications link;transmitter;x.690	Joseph V.

To fill this demand, a critical goal is to improve user throughput performance especially at the cell-edge, even in the LTE (Long Term Evolution)-Advanced system. Multi-cell cooperative transmission is a promising technology and has been extensively studied. This technology requires highly accurate synchronization between multiple BSs. However, the future mobile network will consist of asynchronous networks (e.g., those controlled by IP protocols) and stable synchronization is not possible with existing techniques. We have been studying synchronization schemes for asynchronous networks to realize multi-cell cooperative transmission. In this paper, we present a prototype of a multi-cell cooperative transmission system that combines our synchronization scheme with radio equipment. Experiments confirm its synchronization accuracy, and the resulting wireless transmission performance in the field evaluation indicates our synchronization scheme provides a practical and effective approach.	asynchronous i/o;compaq lte;prototype;synchronization (computer science);throughput	Haruya Miyajima;Manabu Mikami;Hideki Hayashi;Teruya Fujii	2011	2011 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VETECF.2011.6093165	synchronization;cellular network;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;mobile telephony;global positioning system;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;accuracy and precision;prototype;data synchronization;wireless;computer network	Mobile	25.235619018707006	86.12280315129502	153711
fb2fde25ea8b7b4289ab8e29c1f0485f4ba7e663	cache-enabled hetnets with millimeter wave small cells		In this paper, we consider a novel cache-enabled heterogeneous network (HetNet), where macro base stations (BSs) with traditional sub-6 GHz are overlaid by dense millimeter wave (mmWave) pico BSs. These two-tier BSs, which are modeled as two independent homogeneous Poisson point processes, cache multimedia contents following the popularity rank. High-capacity backhauls are utilized between macro BSs and the core server. In contrast to the simplified flat-top antenna pattern analyzed in previous articles, we employ an actual antenna model with the uniform linear array at all mmWave BSs. To evaluate the performance of our system, we introduce two distinctive user association strategies: 1) maximum received power (Max-RP) scheme; and 2) maximum rate (Max-Rate) scheme. With the aid of these two schemes, we deduce new theoretical equations for success probabilities and area spectral efficiencies. Considering a special case with practical path loss laws, several closed-form expressions for coverage probabilities are derived to gain several insights. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to verify the analytical conclusions. We show that: 1) the proposed HetNet is an interference-limited system and it outperforms the traditional HetNets in terms of the success probability; 2) there exists an optimal pre-decided rate threshold that contributes to the maximum ASE; and 3) Max-Rate achieves higher success probability and ASE than Max-RP but it needs the extra information of the interference effect.	adaptive server enterprise;backhaul (telecommunications);cpu cache;carrier frequency;charge-coupled device;chebyshev–gauss quadrature;exptime;emoticon;expanded memory;gauss–kronrod quadrature formula;gnutella2;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;multitier architecture;p (complexity);portable document format;rp (complexity);radiation pattern;scheme;server (computing);simulation;spectral efficiency;stellar classification	Wenqiang Yi;Yuanawei Liu;Arumugam Nallanathan	2018	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2851593	electronic engineering;throughput;algorithm;monte carlo method;path loss;cache;interference (wave propagation);computer science;stochastic process;base station;cellular network	Vision	27.857625893142256	84.43950826581636	154005

In this paper, the TD-LTE network downlink performance of indoor is studied with various deployment options, including outdoor Macro and Micro cell, indoor Femto cell and their combinations in a realistic large-scale dense urban scenario. For accurate modeling, the real three-dimensional (3D) city map of the investigated area is employed. A 3D ray-tracing tool is used to estimate the propagation occurring between outdoor sites and buildings. A semi-empirical building penetration extension is proposed to derive indoor predictions for each floor based on outdoor predictions at ground-level combined with a height gain model. The traffic offloading features of Micro and Femto cell are evaluated through system simulations.	3d computer graphics;bottleneck (engineering);cell (microprocessor);compaq lte;ray tracing (graphics);semiconductor industry;simulation;software deployment;software propagation;telecommunications link	Jianfeng Kang;Zhuyan Zhao;Hao Guan;Benny Vejlgaard;Guangyi Liu	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6555207	simulation;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	26.253727387518573	84.43177368526472	155058

The capacity of this system is difficult to manually compute because of at least two reasons. Firstly, this system is designed to support many types of services, and hence capacity calculation using classic Erlang's capacity is not sufficient. Secondly, the capacity of such system depends on interference which is a time-varying factor, so that it is necessary to precisely model the interference; otherwise the result may be inaccurate. This paper aims to provide complete details of uplink WCDMA modeling and simulation. This proposed simulation is a dynamic system-level simulation in which important parameters such as radio propagation effects, user movement, power control and interference modeling are included. The principles of WCDMA modeling and simulation which are presented in this paper are essential tools for study and research in optimising UMTS system.	algorithm;circuit switching;computer simulation;dynamical system;erlang (programming language);interference (communication);john d. wiley;network packet;performance evaluation;radio-frequency engineering;scheduling (computing);software propagation;system-level simulation;telecommunications link;thomas baumgartner	Rachod Patachaianand;Kumbesan Sandrasegaran	2008	Fifth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations (itng 2008)	10.1109/ITNG.2008.165	code division multiple access;3g;telecommunications;power control;computer science;dynamical system;type of service;radio propagation;mathematical model;modeling and simulation;wsdma;interference;w-cdma;computational model;umts frequency bands;computer network	EDA	27.354355199002267	85.63911789482859	156232

However, the simultaneous usage of the same frequency resources in adjacent LTE cells creates inter-cell interference problems, that mainly affect cell-edge users. Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC) techniques are proposed to avoid the negative impact of interference on system performance. They establish restrictions on resource usage, such as Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR), and on power allocation such as Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR). In this paper, we classify the existing ICIC techniques, and investigate the performance of reuse-1, reuse-3, FFR, and SFR schemes under various user distributions, and for various network loads. Performance of cell-center and cell-edge users are inspected, as well as the overall spectral efficiency. System level simulations show the advantages and limitations of each of the examined techniques compared to frequency reuse-1 model under different network loads and user distributions, which helps us to determine the most suitable ICIC technique to be used.	compaq lte;fairness measure;interference (communication);qualitative comparative analysis;simulation;spectral efficiency;terrestrial television;throughput;time complexity	Mohamed A.

Multicore System-on-a-Chip (MCSoC) solutions supporting small cell LTE base station functionality are commercially available. An MCSoC has to be integrated with necessary software components leveraging specific accelerators for creating a complete LTE base station. System architects have a tough challenge in determining whether a small cell MCSoC would meet their intended small cell base station's feature, functionality and performance demands. This paper discusses the application of modular performance analysis (MPA) using Real-Time Calculus (RTC) on an MCSoC-based LTE base station implementation. Our study validates its applicability as well as its ability to identify new designs that will improve the system performance. This study is first in its kind to propose an analytical framework for analyzing an LTE base station's system design and performance.	compaq lte;component-based software engineering;multi-core processor;profiling (computer programming);real-time clock;system on a chip;systems design	Manikantan Srinivasan;Chebiyyam Siva Ram Murthy;Anusuya Balasubramanian	2015	2015 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)	10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2015.7314388	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;engineering	Mobile	24.709394287664146	83.38947862981901	158755

In particular, we consider the unicast user with delay constraint and the broadcast user with outage constraint. The transmission energy efficiency of the dirty paper coding (DPC) and time division multiple access (TDMA) schemes are analyzed and compared from information theoretic point of view. Specifically, the minimum energy per bit and the wideband slope region are derived in closed forms. While both DPC and TDMA schemes require the same minimum energy per bit, DPC outperforms TDMA with regard to the wideband slope region. We also obtain the critical points for both schemes beyond which the wideband slope decreases for both unicast and broadcast users. Finally, we show how the heterogeneous QoS constraints affect the energy efficiency in hybrid cellular.	dvd region code;deferred procedure call;downtime;eb/n0;information theory;low-power broadcasting;point of view (computer hardware company);quality of service;regional lockout;unicast	Guanying Ru;Hongxiang Li;Lingjia Liu;Zixia Hu;Yong Gan	2014	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2317786	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio;broadcasting;time division multiple access;computer network;unicast	Mobile	29.527911171631747	87.89943767725211	160197

A wireless sensor network is considered in which the sensor nodes are unlicensed users of a wireless network which transmit its data in the uplink channel used by the licensed users. Poisson point process is used to model the distributions of the nodes and the interference caused by the licensed users for the sensor nodes. After finding the optimal throughput in the presence of retransmissions, we focus on analyzing the total power consumption and energy efficiency of the network and how retransmissions, network density and outage threshold affects the energy efficiency of the network.	downtime;interference (communication);point process;requirement;retransmission (data networks);sun outage;telecommunications link;throughput	Iran Ramezanipour;Hirley Alves;Pedro Henrique Juliano Nardelli;Ari Pouttu	2018	2018 IEEE 87th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2018.8417869	wireless sensor network;throughput;wireless network;computer network;efficient energy use;computer science;telecommunications link;retransmission;poisson point process;communication channel	Mobile	31.833447114885015	85.59788086100066	160241

The UEs move around in the cell according to a random walk mobility model. We aim at determining the energy consumption distribution when different linear precoding techniques are used at the BS to guarantee target rates within a finite time interval T. The analysis is conducted in the asymptotic regime where N and K grow large with fixed ratio under the assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI). Both recent and standard results from large system analysis are used to provide concise formulae for the asymptotic transmit powers and beamforming vectors for all considered schemes. These results are eventually used to provide a deterministic approximation of the energy consumption and to study its fluctuations around this value in the form of a central limit theorem. Closed-form expressions for the asymptotic means and variances are given. Numerical results are used to validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and to make comparisons. We show how the results can be used to approximate the probability that a battery-powered BS runs out of energy and also to design the cell radius for minimizing the energy consumption per unit area. The imperfect CSI case is also briefly considered.	approximation algorithm;automated theorem proving;beamforming;channel state information;multi-user mimo;regular expression;system analysis;telecommunications link	Luca Sanguinetti;Aris L.

Especially Single Frequency Networks (SFNs) with OFDM multicarrier transmission have been introduced as an important technology for an efficient usage of the scarce resource spectrum. In an SFN all transmitters send the same signal synchronized in time and frequency. Therefore the insertion of local services within SFNs is not possible without causing severe interference. Hierarchical modulation, which is known from transmission standards like DVB-T and T-DMB, provides an interesting means of inserting local services within an SFN, minimizing the interference in the network. This paper presents a system for the local service insertion in terrestrial SFNs based on hierarchical modulation, which is especially interesting for next generation mobile broadcasting systems like DVB-NGH or ATSC 3.0.	atsc 3.0;digital video broadcasting;interference (communication);modulation;next-generation network;single-frequency network;spectral efficiency;terrestrial television;transmitter	Jan Zöllner;J.

A general hetnet model is considered consisting of an arbitrary number of open-access and closed-access tier of base stations (BSs) arranged according to independent homogeneous Poisson point processes. The BSs of each tier have a constant transmission power, random fading coefficient with an arbitrary distribution and arbitrary path-loss exponent of the power-law path-loss model. For such a system, analytical characterizations for the coverage probability and average rate at an arbitrary mobile-station (MS), and average per-tier load are derived for the max-SINR connectivity model. Using stochastic ordering, interesting properties and simplifications for the hetnet downlink performance are derived by relating this connectivity model to the maximum instantaneous received power (MIRP) connectivity model, providing good insights about the hetnets and the downlink performance in these complex networks.

In this paper, we derive an analytical solution for the calculation of outage probability in a wireless multihop network. The outage probability is the probability of a transmission between two nodes may not be established because there is no available channels along a specific route or the signal-to-interference ratio is below a specified threshold. The proposed solution is compared with simulations, and an excellent agreement is attained.	approximation;downtime;interference (communication);rayleigh–ritz method;simulation	Álvaro Augusto M. de Medeiros;Michel Daoud Yacoub	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.889	closed-form expression;signal-to-interference ratio;telecommunications;radio resource management;probability;statistics;computer network	Mobile	29.57254141229733	85.29548197843371	162744
0915df6899d6e6c537ba6e0b22ddf60a62fdfc00	towards the performance evaluation of 4th generation wireless communication standards: lte versus mobile wimax	lte;phy layer;overhead;comparison;wimax;throughput;tdd	Advances in wireless communication protocols and networking toward support of the next generation of mobile and radio broadband technologies have contributed to a strong competition among various telecommunication standards in particular Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Mobile Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX). In this paper, we provide an in-depth comparison analysis of LTE and Mobile WiMAX at the physical (PHY) layer by studying the most similar PHY configuration scenarios for these two technologies. Our study includes a throughput analysis of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions in time division duplex with the least overhead possible and different antenna schemes as well as modulation and code rates. This study also performs an overhead analysis in both protocols to provide a more in-depth understanding of the PHY layer capacity in various PHY layer configurations. Our simulation results generally show higher performance for LTE in both DL and UL transmission with 7 Mbps in DL and 5 Mbps in UL, when using one antenna port. However, by increasing the number of antennas for multiple-input/multiple-output configurations, the results illustrate a reduction in the performance of LTE compared to Mobile WiMAX. This arises from the increase in reference signal overhead in LTE from 4.7% in single-input/single-output (SISO) to 14.28% in 4 4 multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO).

For MC-CDM-based packet communication, a frequency scheduling method, which adaptively assigns different sub-carriers to different users, is proposed. This paper proposes a frequency scheduling method, which utilizes pre-assignmented subcarriers in the frequency domain for the MC-CDM scheme. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed system in frequency selective fading channels is compared with that of a no-scheduled MC-CDM scheme by computer simulation in both singleand multi-cell environments. From the results, it is found that the proposed system achieves better bit error rate performance than the no-scheduled MC-CDM scheme and can control quality of service (QoS) for active users. key words: frequency selective fading channel, multi-carrier code division multiplexing (MC-CDM), multi-user channel, resource management	bit error rate;computer simulation;data rate units;multi-user;multiplexing;network packet;quality of service;scheduling (computing);subcarrier;telecommunications link;trionic	Shigehiko Tsumura;Yoshitaka Hara;Shinsuke Hara	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/E88-B.2.706	computer simulation;fair-share scheduling;embedded system;code division multiple access;quality control;telecommunications link;mobile telephony;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;subcarrier;scheduling;service quality;fading	Mobile	31.201727732733293	87.91141480809533	163531

These rules decrease the achievable throughput for the portable unlicensed devices because the portable unlicensed devices are required to perform a channel availability query (CAQ) before transmitting. In order to reduce the number of CAQs, the Federal Communications Commission allows a region based mobility procedure (RMP). In this paper, we propose a new-RMP using directional information in order to enhance the achievable throughput. Directional information enables an unlicensed portable device to increase its achievable throughput by considering a uni- directional region that is smaller than an omni-directional region. Simulation results show that the proposed RMPs enhance the achievable throughput compared to the conventional RMPs. In addition, the achievable throughput for the proposed RMP using a navigation system is greatly enhanced compared to the conventional RMPs.	geolocation;mobile device;pdf/a;risk management plan;simulation;throughput;transmitter;white spaces (radio)	Jihaeng Heo;Gosan Noh;Sungsoo Park;Eunsun Kim;Daesik Hong	2013	2013 IEEE 78th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2013.6692161	telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Mobile	25.86129631478003	86.52904489213174	163959

We adopt a standard currently used in commercial satellite systems as a reference. The multibeam satellite antenna radiation diagram has been generated using a physical optics reflector model, while state-of-the art channel models have been used for the land mobile satellite (LMS) channel. The interference pattern has been derived through a system simulator developed by the European Space Agency (ESA). Starting from the analysis of the interference pattern we study the application of a low complexity soft interference cancellation scheme. Our results show that, under realistic interference and propagation conditions and for existing standards, a two-colors frequency reuse scheme can be employed while guaranteeing service availability across the coverage and keeping the complexity at the user terminals relatively low.	bandwidth (signal processing);bell laboratories layered space-time;best, worst and average case;catastrophic interference;color;communications of the acm;communications satellite;diagram;esa;full scale;global serializability;interference (communication);iterative method;john d. wiley;msat;satellite dish;shannon (unit);simplified instructional computer;simulation;software propagation;telecommunications link;throughput	Giuseppe Cocco;Martina Angelone;Ana I.

At the same time, introducing active/sleep modes in base stations (BSs) is an effective method to save the energy consumption of cellular networks. However, the performance of the two techniques would be dependent and interact with each other if both of them were employed in cellular networks. In this paper, we analyze the performance and investigate the sleeping strategy design problem in the cellular network, in which the mobile devices have the capability of energy harvesting from the ambient RF signals. Specifically, using tools from stochastic geometry theory, we derive analytical expressions of the coverage probability and the harvested energy and show that they are both affected by the sleeping strategy. Then, we formulate a BSs power consumption minimization problem under the coverage probability and harvesting performance constraints. Finally, the optimal operating regime of the sleeping strategy is derived. Numerical results confirm the correctness of the analysis and show the effect of switching off BSs on both performance metrics.	correctness (computer science);effective method;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;mobile device;numerical method;optimization problem;ps-algol;radio frequency;requirement;simulation;sleep mode	Kun Chen;Xiangming Wen;Wenpeng Jing;Zhaoming Lu;Hua Shao;Heng Xu	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7511118	stochastic geometry models of wireless networks;transmitter;telecommunications;mathematical model;interference;energy harvesting;radio frequency	Mobile	31.419696687403157	86.36324884825926	164184

In this paper, we consider wireless systems transmitting randomly arrived traffic over fading channels with statistical quality-of-service requirement, characterized by a delay bound and a delay bound violation probability. We study the relation between the maximal energy efficiency (EE) and the delay bound with given delay violation probability. We prove that the EE-delay tradeoff vanishes if the average total power consumption, including transmit and circuit powers of the base station, linearly increases with the average service/transmission rate. By taking massive multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system as an example, we show that if the required total power consumption is a linear function of the service rate, the maximal EE is independent of the delay bound. If the required total power is strictly convex in the service rate, then the EE can be improved by extending the delay.	convex function;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;limit cycle;linear function;mimo;maxima and minima;maximal set;quality of service;randomness;requirement;transmitter;tucker decomposition	Changyang She;Chenyang Yang	2015	2015 IEEE Online Conference on Green Communications (OnlineGreenComm)	10.1109/OnlineGreenCom.2015.7387376	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;mathematics	EDA	31.67944786076959	85.37499815541186	164730
101fd1ea02a5b615da5a1ee714cb6c8b77b8fe83	diversity and multiplexing technologies by 3d beams in polarized massive mimo systems		Massive multiple input, multiple output (M-MIMO) technologies have been proposed to scale up data rates reaching gigabits per second in the forthcoming 5G mobile communications systems. However, one of crucial constraints is a dimension in space to implement theM-MIMO. To cope with the space constraint and to utilize more flexibility in 3D beamforming (3D-BF), we propose antenna polarization in M-MIMO systems. In this paper, we design a polarized M-MIMO (PM-MIMO) system associated with 3D-BF applications, where the system architectures for diversity and multiplexing technologies achieved by polarized 3D beams are provided. Different from the conventional 3D-BF achieved by planar M-MIMO technology to control the downtilted beam in a vertical domain, the proposed PM-MIMO realizes 3D-BF via the linear combination of polarized beams. In addition, an effective array selection scheme is proposed to optimize the beam-width and to enhance system performance by the exploration of diversity and multiplexing gains; and a blind channel estimation (BCE) approach is also proposed to avoid pilot contamination in PMMIMO. Based on the Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) specification, the simulation results finally confirm the validity of our proposals.

The instantaneous received signal-to-interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) and the user throughput performance employing the proposed RLC methods are investigated using system-level simulations. From the simulation results, we show that the proposed independent RLC method between the downlink and uplink and the proposed multipoint RLC method based on coordinated multipoint transmission/reception achieve a higher user throughput both in the downlink and uplink compared to the conventional commonRLCmethod. Therefore, the proposed independent and multipoint RLC methods are very promising candidates to improve the user throughput particularly near the cell edge in a heterogeneous network for LTE-Advanced.	advanced mezzanine card;centralized computing;compaq lte;hybrid automatic repeat request;interference (communication);multipoint ground;network packet;noise power;rlc circuit;radio resource management;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;system-level simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Akihito Morimoto;Motohiro Tanno;Yoshihisa Kishiyama;Kenichi Higuchi;Mamoru Sawahashi	2009	VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073617	radio link protocol;throughput;electronic engineering;heterogeneous network;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;lte advanced;feedback;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Mobile	27.54632994214368	88.25405301061518	166002

Since most femtocell base stations (FBSs) can be accessed only by a certain closed subscriber group (CSG), mobile users may suffer from heavy interference and poor signal reception. Hybrid access control is one of methods to improve the communication quality by allowing mobile users to access nearby FBSs when these FBSs have surplus resource. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid access policy that mobile users may access nearby FBSs when they are outside the coverage regions of macrocell base stations (MBSs) and suffer from low signal power. We then derive the coverage probability by assuming that the locations of the macrocell base stations and the femtocell base stations follow independent Poisson point processes. The proposed hybrid policy can be viewed as a generalization of both the open and the closed access policies, hence the analytical results can also be applied to either the open access policy or the closed access policy.	access control;constructive solid geometry;function-behaviour-structure ontology;interference (communication);multitier architecture;paywall;simulation	Cheng-Yu Shih;Chia-han Lee	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6554885	telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	27.428628561936314	87.56426002786753	169377

We showed that knowing the uplink coverage one can accurately balance the service area in downlink and uplink in the radio network. Also, it was shown that the choice of optimal antenna beam width and tilt is important for better performances. Thus, the interference may be controlled and the capacity and coverage may be balanced and improved. However, it was also shown that higher user data rates may lead to lower capacity of the system and higher instability of the available capacity.

Our motivation in this paper is to develop a scheme that would support a large number of users as well as their demands, while eliminating to a large extent the side effects of the inherent protocols used in our scheme. We propose a novel hybrid medium access control (MAC) scheme, based on the theoretical ‘near-perfect’ CDMA using W-CDMA/SFH/OFDM and an SDM component to support sector-based multimedia services. We also present a scheduling mechanism to support the hybrid algorithm. In order to increase the number of users that can be supported by the system and thereby reducing the call-blocking factor as much as possible, we have made use of the Dynamic Packet Assignment algorithm. In this paper, we present our hybrid MAC protocol, its implementation and the simulation experiments we have carried out to evaluate its performance.	access control;assignment (computer science);bandwidth management;blocking (computing);expect;experiment;hybrid algorithm;mimo-ofdm;network packet;next-generation network;quality of service;scheduling (computing);side effect (computer science);simulation;standard database management analysis	Azzedine Boukerche;Pattabiraman Vikram	2002		10.1109/LCN.2002.1181870	cellular network;code division multiple access;bandwidth management;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;hybrid algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;scheduling;side effect;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	29.036101208256085	88.06214425306506	169564

Two inband operation modes of relay nodes are supported, namely type 1 and type 1b. Relay nodes promise to offer considerable gain for system capacity or coverage, depending on the deployment prioritization, in a cost-efficient way. Yet, in order to fully exploit the benefits of relaying, the inter-cell interference which is increased due to the presence of relay nodes should be limited. Moreover, large differences in the received power levels from different users should be avoided. The goal is to keep the receiver dynamic range low in order to retain the orthogonality of the single carrier-frequency division multiple access system. In this paper, an evaluation of the relay based heterogeneous deployment within the LTE-Advanced uplink framework is carried out by applying the standardized LTE Release 8 power control scheme both at evolved node B and relay nodes. In order to enhance the overall system performance, different power control optimization strategies are proposed for 3GPP urban and suburban scenarios. A comparison between type 1 and type 1b relay nodes is as well presented to study the effect of the relaying overhead on the system performance in inband relay deployments. Comprehensive system level simulations show that the power control is a crucial means to increase the cell edge and system capacities, to mitigate inter-cell interference and to adjust the receiver dynamic range for both relay node types.	access network;channel capacity;compaq lte;cost efficiency;dynamic range;frequency divider;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);relay;simulation;software deployment;telecommunications link;throughput	Ömer Bulakci;Simone Redana;Bernhard Raaf;Jyri Hämäläinen	2011	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2011.6157454	radio access network;dynamic range;heterogeneous network;telecommunications link;telecommunications;power control;computer science;resource management;interference;relay channel;bandwidth;computer network;cost efficiency	Mobile	26.678992971230436	88.4743713883393	169617

However, current CoMP studies mainly focus on joint transmission (JT), dynamic point selection (DPS) and coordinated scheduling/beamforming (CS/CB) which all fall into closed-loop category. When considering medium or high mobility users, closed-loop CoMP seems less effective, while open-loop CoMP is more preferred, which is similar to that observed between closed-loop and open-loop single user multiple-input multiple-output (SU-MIMO). In this paper, we propose open-loop CoMP transmission frameworks for both spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity. We design our open-loop CoMP schemes by reusing long term evolution (LTE) open-loop SU-MIMO structures as much as possible to alleviate standardization efforts, and especially consider support for demodulation reference signals (DM-RS) which will be prevalent in future LTE-Advanced systems.

In this paper, we propose a theoretical interference model of V2V communications at an intersection that uses transmission power control method. To evaluate and address the interference problem at an intersection, we derived an analytical expression of the outage probability of a typical vehicle at an intersection and provide guidelines for an optimal power control method, which cannot be obtained through simulations. We model the location of vehicles in queueing segments and running segments separately and analyze their interference based on a stochastic geometry approach. In our model, a simple power control method is used: the transmission power of each vehicle is determined by the status of the vehicle, i.e., stopping or running. By changing the transmission power of vehicles in queueing segments, we can mitigate the interference received at vehicles running closer to an intersection. By using the theoretical results, we obtain an optimal power control method, which can balance the trade-off between the outage probabilities of vehicles in queueing segments and running segments. We validated our analytical results and the effect of the power control on V2V communications through numerical experiments.	downtime;experiment;interference (communication);network congestion;numerical analysis;simulation;statistical interference;vehicle-to-vehicle	Tatsuaki Kimura;Hiroshi Saito	2016		10.1145/2988287.2989156	vehicular ad hoc network;simulation;poisson point process;telecommunications;power control;intersection;statistics;stochastic geometry	Mobile	29.926441639944223	84.09082791717786	169823

Since today's wireless terminals are typically equipped with multiple network access interfaces such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and cellular networks, this paper investigates user terminals cooperating with each other in transmitting their data packets to the base station (BS), by exploiting the multiple network access interfaces, called inter-network cooperation. We also examine the conventional schemes without user cooperation and with intra-network cooperation for comparison. Given target outage probability and data rate requirements, we analyze the energy consumption of conventional schemes as compared to the proposed inter-network cooperation by taking into account both physical-layer channel impairments and upper-layer protocol overheads. It is shown that distances between different network entities (i.e., user terminals and BS) have a significant influence on the energy efficiency of proposed inter-network cooperation scheme. Specifically, when the cooperating users are close to BS or the users are far away from each other, the inter-network cooperation may consume more energy than conventional schemes without user cooperation or with intra-network cooperation. However, as the cooperating users move away from BS and the inter-user distance is not too large, the inter-network cooperation significantly reduces the energy consumption over conventional schemes."""	access network;bluetooth;data rate units;downtime;encapsulation (networking);entity;network packet;requirement;transmitter	Yulong Zou;Jia Zhu;Rui Zhang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2013.011613.120358	telecommunications;computer science;engineering;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	28.8953501960832	87.15786673610374	169854

Users first harvest energy from the downlink WPT, and then use the harvested energy for uplink transmission. We adopt the downlink received signal power (DRSP) based user association to maximize the harvested energy, and address the impact of massive MIMO on the user association. By using new statistical properties, we then obtain the exact expressions for the average harvested energy and the average uplink achievable rate of a user in such networks. Numerical results corroborate our analysis and demonstrate that compared to deploying more small cells, the use of a large number of antennas is more appealing since it brings in significant increase in the harvested energy of the HetNets. In addition, results illustrate that serving more users in the massive MIMO aided macrocells decreases the harvested energy and the uplink achievable rate of the HetNets.	mimo;multitier architecture;numerical linear algebra;telecommunications link	Yongxu Zhu;Lifeng Wang;Kai-Kit Wong;Shi Jin	2016	2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760364	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	30.641193147922213	85.627721058583	170762

In the wireless system which we consider, an access point(AP) forms multiple beams by using multiple antennae and the users of wireless systems get services at the same time by using these beams. By doing so, the spectral efficiency of the wireless system can be increased because multiple data streams can be transmitted at the same time. In this paper, we propose a downlink power control scheme in which the transmission power of each beam is allocated by considering the interference to neighboring APs so that overall system throughput can be improved. Through performance analysis and simulation results, we show that our proposed scheme can increase overall system throughput. We also show that our proposed scheme can improve the throughput even though the information of neighboring APs is inaccurate, which implies that our proposed scheme is robust to errors.	interference (communication);profiling (computer programming);simulation;smart antenna;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput	Woongsup Lee;Dong-Ho Cho	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493740	niobium;throughput;electronic engineering;telecommunications;power control;computer science;engineering;antenna;smart antenna;interference;artificial neural network;wireless;spectral efficiency;computer network	Mobile	28.690535163847752	87.66442899972978	170805

329d7ed735cdd86a1d3c798c25a989c0c1528b35	multi-cell coordination via disjoint clustering in dense millimeter wave cellular networks		Conventional microwave bands are expected to encounter bandwidth shortage due to the ever-increasing demand for high speed wireless services. The use of millimeter wave (MMW) spectrum has been regarded as one of the promising solutions to support data traffic demands in future cellular networks. MMW cellular networks are envisioned to be densely deployed to attain acceptable coverage and rate. In dense networks, intercell interference emerges as the main factor of degrading the coverage and capacity. As such, coordination of base stations (BSs) should be implemented to improve the system performance. In this paper, we aim to quantify the performance of BS coordination via disjoint clustering in dense MMW cellular networks. Using tools from stochastic geometry, the coverage probability and area spectral efficiency are derived by incorporating the key features of MMW systems, i.e., blockage and directional antenna. Simulation results are provided to validate the accuracy of the analytical results under various system parameters and demonstrate the performance superiority of BS coordination via disjoint clustering over the non-coordinated case. The results suggest that the optimal cluster size to achieve the maximum area spectral efficiency (ASE) increases as the blockage factor, which is determined by the density and the average size of the buildings, decreases.	adaptive server enterprise;catastrophic interference;cluster analysis;cobham's thesis;interference (communication);microwave;multi-user mimo;multitier architecture;numerical integration;numerical linear algebra;scheduling (computing);simulation;spectral efficiency	Nor Aishah Muhammad;He Chen;Wei Bao;Yonghui Li;Branka Vucetic	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7997441	stochastic geometry;wireless;computer network;directional antenna;cluster analysis;computer science;cellular network;base station;bandwidth (signal processing);spectral efficiency	Mobile	26.061630539420467	88.48628073580004	172526

By comparing the prototype systems based on mismatch, antenna isolation and metrics for the antenna radiation pattern, we assess their performance. We apply our benchmark results to measurements performed in a 802.11p testbed.

02c10ecf884dba151555cbbc40c2ff23925ae577	performance analysis of drone small cells under inter-cell interference		Inter-cell interference is one of important factors in drone small cells (DSCs). However, most works investigated the network performance of DSC networks with an assumption of interference-free. To achieve a realistic analysis, we analyze the coverage probability and achievable rate of DSC networks under inter-cell interference. However, the air-to-ground channel between DSCs and ground users consists of probabilistic line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links, which brings challenges to calculate the inter-cell interference. In this paper, we model the inter-cell interference by using equivalent uniform density plane-entity method first. Then, we study coverage probability and achievable rate considering Rician fading in LoS links and Rayleigh fading in NLoS links. Final, we show the impact of deployment density in numerical results, finding that there exists optimal deployment density that achieves best coverage performance.	interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);network performance;numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;software deployment	Jiejie Xie;Chao Dong;Hai Wang;Aijing Li	2017	2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171007	computer science;computer network;rician fading;coverage probability;rayleigh fading;non-line-of-sight propagation;network performance;uniform distribution (continuous);communication channel;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	28.03637162142734	84.55545234815649	173733

Thus, this study conducts an evaluation of vertical sectorization in LTE field trial with single user. The field trial results show that the average downlink throughput of the single user is reduced compared to the one of traditional network, which results in the deterioration of user experience. Furthermore, we examine field data and antenna parameters, and verify that the co-frequency interference between the inner and outer cells is the main reason for average downlink throughput decrease in field trial. Obviously, without proper interference suppression or can-celation mechanisms, the vertical sectorization can not improve the user experience. Therefore, some practical suggestions on the deployment of vertical sectorization in LTE network are proposed.	compaq lte;interference (communication);simulation;software deployment;telecommunications link;throughput;user experience;variometer;vertical market software;zero suppression	Fengyi Yang;Jianmin Zhang;Weiliang Xie;Xuetian Zhu	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6883700	single antenna interference cancellation;telecommunications	Mobile	26.23492628575268	82.85364993867691	175413

Usually the simulated terrain is modeled as regular area such as urban, metropolitan, with general assumption that all areas have the same user's dissemination. In this paper, we provide a simple but representative as logical thinking of geographical model in a given area. This geographical model represents the possible areas that users can be located. Comparison of cellular planning with traditional K-means cluster and Geo-Clustering model is presented in simulation results. In addition, coverage probability and required SINR are taken as main performance metrics.	algorithm;cluster analysis;k-means clustering;mimo;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link	Thomhert Suprapto Siadari;Soo Young Shin	2012	2012 International Conference on ICT Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2012.6386794	simulation;geography;telecommunications;computer network	Robotics	26.642632533301423	85.5443902825438	175583
5c08aa2163ac6e42ad8b478b0bcc0e20d88664c2	trinity: a practical transmitter cooperation framework to handle heterogeneous user profiles in wireless networks	heterogeneous user profiles;network mimo;transmitter cooperation;distributed antenna system das	To handle increased capacity demands, sophisticated MIMO-based transmission strategies, based on transmitter cooperation, have emerged. However, different types of users' channels (e.g., static vs mobile, stable vs dynamic channels) that make up today's enterprises, require different MIMO transmission strategies. With the wrong strategy, a user could even see a degradation in performance. Our overarching goal is to design and implement a framework, TRINITY, that can simultaneously cater to a heterogeneous mix of users, by intelligently combining a plurality of MIMO transmission strategies wherein the transmitters at different nodes can cooperate to deliver significant performance gains. Three key challenges that we address in building TRINITY are: (i) how to categorize users into channel profiles such that a single transmission strategy caters to the users of a profile, (ii) how to combine strategies to communicate with users of different profiles simultaneously, and (iii) what is the granularity of transmitter cooperation needed to balance efficiency with complexity. We implement and evaluate TRINITY on our WARP radio testbed. Our extensive experiments show that TRINITY's intelligent combining of transmission strategies improves the total network rate by 50%-150%, satisfies the QoS requirements of thrice as many users, and improves PSNR for video traffic by 10 dB compared to individual transmission strategies.	categorization;elegant degradation;experiment;mimo;peak signal-to-noise ratio;requirement;testbed;transmitter	Shailendra Singh;Karthikeyan Sundaresan;Srikanth V.

However, excessive densification and aggressive offloading can also cause the degradation of network performance due to problems of interference and load. In this paper, with consideration of load issues, we study the optimal base station density that maximizes the throughput of the network. The expected link rate and the utilization ratio of the contention-based channel are derived as the functions of base station density using the Poisson Point Process (PPP) and Markov Chain. They reveal the rules of deployment. Based on these results, we obtain the throughput of the network and indicate the optimal deployment density under different network conditions. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate our analysis and show the substantial performance gain obtained by the proposed deployment scheme. These results can provide guidance for the network densification.	cobham's thesis;computer simulation;deploy;elegant degradation;genetic heterogeneity;interference (communication);markov chain;network congestion;network performance;point process;random graph;reuse (action);rule (guideline);throughput;viewpoint;anatomical layer	Jianyuan Feng;Zhiyong Feng	2017		10.3390/s17092077	throughput;software deployment;heterogeneous network;engineering;network performance;computer network;interference (wave propagation);markov chain;communication channel;base station	Metrics	27.632290183857044	85.84348432472773	176916

The source and receiver are located at a fixed distance and all the relay nodes are distributed as a 2-D homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). We first derive the spatial distribution of the set of decoding relays whose received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are above the minimum SNR threshold. This set is a 2-D inhomogeneous PPP. From this set, we select a relay that has minimum path loss to the receiver and derive the achievable coverage due to this selection. The analysis is developed using tools from stochastic geometry and is verified using Monte-Carlo simulation. The coverage probabilities of the direct link without relaying, a randomly chosen relay link, and the selected relay link are compared to show the significant performance gain when relay selection is used. We also analyze the effects of beam misalignment and different power allocations at the source and relay on coverage probability. In addition, rate coverage and spectral efficiency are compared for direct and selected relay links to show impressive performance gains with relaying.	direction finding;inline linking;monte carlo method;point process;randomness;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software deployment;spectral efficiency	Khagendra Belbase;Zhang Zhang;Hai Jiang;Chintha Tellambura	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2827026	stochastic geometry;computer network;computer science;path loss;decoding methods;relay;poisson point process;control theory;coverage probability;spectral efficiency;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	28.195188041077497	84.17623446182203	177595

As the radio cells move toward smaller size, the traditional procedures for call setup and control are not suitable well due to the high handoff frequency. The cable TV (CATV) network is one of the most attractive backbones for PCS due to its prevalent and broadcast nature. This significantly reduces the implementation costs and the handoff overheads. This paper proposes two architectures for the CATV-based PCS system. In the first architecture, each base station is equipped with multiple fixed receivers to provide fast and seamless handoffs for mobile terminals. Nevertheless, it suffers from the expensive hardware cost. In the second architecture, each base station is only equipped with one tunable receiver. This simple and economic architecture suffers from the possibility of offset conflict when mobile terminals handoff between the cells. Three channel allocation algorithms are proposed to resolve the offset conflict problem. Simulation results indicate the one with the concept of clustering performs much better than the other two schemes in terms of offset conflict probability.	algorithm;cable modem;cluster analysis;downstream (software development);internet backbone;logical unit number;memory management;seamless3d;simulation;telecommunications network	Nen-Fu Huang;Chi-An Su;Han-Chieh Chao	1998		10.1109/INFCOM.1998.665097	computer simulation;frequency allocation;telecommunications;computer science;base station;probability;radio receiver;television;computer network	Mobile	25.08966332290745	86.6001881128736	178935

A new method is proposed here to avoid the interference generated by the femtocell on the macrocell downlink communications. In particular, the estimation of the direction of arrival of the primary user signals is used to place nulls in the femtocell transmission paths by means of a suitable beamforming algorithm. The novelty of the proposed approach is that it works on a physical resource basis, taking into account the specific LTE-A access scheme. In this way it is able to manage the interference towards several macrocell users characterized by a high angle dispersion of the multipath components. The obtained numerical results show that the system is able to significantly reduce the interference in different operational conditions, especially when the physical resource blocks belonging to the same macrocell user can be clustered, thus increasing the dimension of the snapshot used for the direction of arrival estimation.	algorithm;beamforming;compaq lte;direction of arrival;frequency band;interference (communication);multipath propagation;numerical analysis;snapshot (computer storage);telecommunications link;zero suppression	Giulio Bartoli;Romano Fantacci;Dania Marabissi;Marco Pucci	2014	2014 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906488	telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	26.569935901472228	88.0649242235266	179202

We investigate a joint design on caching placement and file delivery for realizing secure and energy-efficient transmissions against randomly distributed eavesdroppers. We propose a novel hybrid “most popular content” and “largest content diversity” caching placement policy to distribute the files of different popularities. Depending on the availability and placement of the requested file, we employ three cooperative transmission schemes, namely, distributed beamforming, frequency-domain orthogonal transmission, and best SBS relaying. We derive analytical expressions for the connection outage probability and secrecy outage probability for each transmission scheme. Afterward, we design the optimal transmission rates and caching allocation successively to achieve a maximal overall secrecy throughput and secrecy energy efficiency, respectively. Numerical results verify the theoretical analyses and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed hybrid caching policy.	beamforming;cache (computing);direction finding;downtime;maximal set;portable document format;profiling (computer programming);randomness;rayleigh–ritz method;smart battery system;throughput;zero crossing	Tong-Xing Zheng;Hui-Ming Wang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2873359	wireless network;throughput;electronic engineering;secrecy;computer network;cache;macro;beamforming;cellular network;base station;computer science	Mobile	30.64815268163218	86.08614303856659	179520

We assume that macro and pico base stations and user equipments are uniformly distributed in the network. User could be paired to its nearest base station or to the BS from which the average received power in the downlink is maximum. Uplink in both cases is coupled to downlink. For symmetric services both up and down links should be able to carry the information flow. Correlation between uplink and downlink coverage could be guessed even under independent Rayleigh fading. The symmetric spectral efficiency gathers both uplink and downlink capacities while forcing them to happen simultaneously. We used realistic spectral efficiencies as signaled by channel quality indicators in LTE. Fractional power control has also been included in the analysis. The results of coverage and spectral efficiency for marginal uplink, marginal downlink, and joint uplink/downlink has been obtained. The assumption of independence between both links is analyzed for the complex trade off of the parameters for network design to obtain the best symmetric efficiency.	spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Muhammad Mujtaba Shaikh;M.

In this paper, we observe that the nature of interference changes fundamentally as we shrink cell size, with near line of sight interference from neighboring picocells seeing significantly smaller path loss exponents than interference in macrocellular environments. Using a propagation model proposed by Franceschetti, which compactly models increased interference in small cells, we show that the network capacity does not scale linearly with the reduction in cell size with standard frequency reuse strategies. Rather, more sophisticated resource sharing strategies based on beamforming and base station cooperation are required to realize the potential of small cells in providing high spectral efficiencies and quasi-deterministic guarantees on availability. Numerical results justifying these conclusions include Chernoff bounds on outage probability for random base station deployment (according to a spatial Poisson process), and simulations for deployment in a regular grid.	amplifier;beamforming;chernoff bound;downtime;interference (communication);overhead (computing);regular grid;scalability;simulation;software deployment;software propagation;spectral efficiency;sun outage	Dinesh Ramasamy;Radhakrishna Ganti;Upamanyu Madhow	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620224	simulation;frequency allocation;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management	Arch	27.55390485912799	85.01325106565734	181145
9f8c8a5ec544887627f9d94286bcf5f0eedb6f39	a cross-layer information centric-relay transmission strategy for mimo-ofdma multicellular networks		Power control has been a standard issue in modern wireless communications. As a result, several cooperative schemes have been developed towards reducing the downlink transmission power. One possible approach is the use of relays that forward information from the base station BS to the mobile stations MSs. However, up to now, the proposed relaying schemes are focusing solely on channel characteristics. In this work, a novel, content-aware relaying scheme is introduced, where the MSs can act as active relays based on their requested content and channel quality. Content awareness is achieved with a cross-layer algorithm, which considers an information-centric networking layer. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated considering a multiple input multiple output MIMO cellular configuration with one tier of cells around the central cell, where the downlink transmission power in terms of mean values has been compared to the typical non-content-aware case. For this reason, a hybrid system-link level simulator has been developed that executes independent Monte Carlo MC simulations in parallel. Moreover, the orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA physical layer protocol has been employed as well, in order to comply with fourth generation standards. The derived results indicate that, compared to the non-content-aware case, the proposed relay transmission algorithm can provide up to 7/17% transmission power gain in medium or highly loaded networks i.e., 10% and 40% blocking probabilities, respectively in a symmetric 2×2 MIMO configuration i.e., equal number of transmit and receive antennas. Moreover, compared to the case where no relay transmission is supported, then the aforementioned gain can reach up to 20%. Finally, the proposed algorithm can provide up to 25% reduction on the overall transmission delay from the relay node to the destination compared to the non-content-aware case.

Based on this specific TDD property, an equation for capacity in a CDMA/TDD system is derived. Moreover, it is shown that the capacity in a CDMA/TDD system can be significantly higher compared with an equivalent FDD system. This assumes use of a DCA algorithm. A novel DCA is presented which uses a newly developed method termed: time slot (TS) opposing technique. The main advantage of this technique is that a TDD system adopting different asymmetries for uplink and downlink in neighbouring cells does not necessarily suffer from capacity losses.

Several channel access procedures are proposed and simulated using block oriented network simulator (BONeS) simulation of a model 36-port system. Simulation results exhibit that load-sharing system with LIBTA algorithm is better than directed retry system with the same algorithm by around 0.9 erlangs while better than quasi-""""xed channel assignment (QFCA) system by around 2 erlangs if the grade of service (GOS) is constrained to less than 10 per cent. Plus, a hybrid time-slot selection procedure is proposed to enhance the system performance. It is observed that systems with hybrid time-slot selection perform better than those with LIBTA algorithm in GOS under heavy load. It is also observed that load sharing system with hybrid time-slot selection algorithm is better than directed retry system with the same algorithm by around 0.7 erlangs and better than QFCA system by around 2 erlangs.

2ec2a7260a6d58e4c1351278df900d6384bffbb7	identifying coverage holes: where to densify?		We develop a methodology to identify coverage holes in cellular markets, given demographic and socio-economic information of the population, detailed knowledge of the current macro-cellular infrastructure, and the spectrum capabilities of a cellular operator. Coverage holes are defined as areas where users contending for macro BS resources outnumber those who eventually get serviced with minimum acceptable average rates. We develop a method that begins with filtering out users who connect to the Internet through Wi-Fi or to their data networks through small cell BSs. Since the rate observed by a user is a function of their own SINR as well as that of other connected users, we generate an SINR heat map and use a fair scheduling algorithm that allows us to determine the effective load on a BS as a number of users. By comparing the cell load to the number of users with acceptable rates, we obtain a coverage map that identifies holes that should be targeted by further densification. We observe that more cells will be in major deficit ten years from now, with up to 25% of an operator's cells requiring more than four additional micro cell BSs to fill the gap. Finally, we give a list of extensions of this work.	algorithm;electron hole;fair-share scheduling;heat map;internet;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Rebal Jurdi;Jeffrey G.

This implies that the channel estimation mean-square error (MSE) of the mobile terminals with various speeds should remain lower than a threshold. This usually causes higher pilot overhead in terms of more bandwidth and transmit power. In this paper, a commonly used time multiplexing pilot pattern is reconsidered from a different point of view in contrast with the previous studies. In a frame, the intervals between each data time slot and the nearest pilot time slot are different, and thus the tracking abilities of each data time slot are also different. Therefore, a system is able to support a number of levels of users' moving speed, even though using a fixed pilot pattern. In order to analyze the tracking ability of each time slot, the MSE for two interpolation methods, i.e., linear minimum MSE and linear interpolation, is derived. Based on the derived analytical results, a novel criterion for pilot spacing design is presented, and a novel scheduling algorithm based on user moving speeds is also proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed pilot design and scheduling algorithm can achieve significant performance improvement.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);channel state information;fairness measure;linear interpolation;mean squared error;multiplexing;network packet;overhead (computing);retransmission (data networks);scheduling (computing);simulation	Cheng Feng;Yingyang Chen;Hongyu Cui;Meng Ma;Bingli Jiao	2015	2015 24th Wireless and Optical Communication Conference (WOCC)	10.1109/WOCC.2015.7346194	estimation;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;interpolation;computer science;scheduling;bandwidth;multiplexing;wireless;statistics	Mobile	29.012446431255977	88.06064435554642	185029

In I2RV, vehicles are used as relaying terminals between eNodeB/BS and a receiving user equipment located or mounted on another traveling vehicle, for the aim of extending coverage, improving performance, and attaining distributed transmission. Initial works on cooperative vehicular communications build upon the assumption of flat and quasi-static fading channels, this can be justified only for narrowband systems in very slow traffic flows such as in rush-hours. In this paper, we consider highway traffic with high-speed mobility resulting in doubly-selective (i.e., time- and frequency-selective) channels. To overcome the performance degradation, we make use of precoded cooperative transmission accompanied with an opportunistic best-relay selection technique to extract the rich underlying multipath-Doppler-spatial diversity gains. Our performance analysis through pairwise error probability (PEP) derivation shows that, through proper precoding, the proposed system is able to extract maximum available diversity in time, frequency and space. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expressions for the outage probability as a bench-mark for future analysis for the proposed scheme. Through numerical analysis, we demonstrate that significant coverage advantage by extending the transmission distance targeting a specific error rate and using the same transmitting power can be achieved.	compaq lte;distributed transmission system;downtime;elegant degradation;multipath propagation;notability in the english wikipedia;numerical analysis;pairwise error probability;relay;sun outage;telecommunications link;transmitter	Mohamed Fathy Feteiha;Hossam S.

In this article we give a brief technical overview of MIMO-OFDM system design. We focus on various research topics for the MIMO-OFDM-based air interface, including spatial channel modeling, MIMO-OFDM transceiver design, MIMO-OFDM channel estimation, space-time techniques for MIMO-OFDM, and error correction code.

The total efficiency is composed of spectrum efficiency, blocking probability, and forced termination probability, and represents the comprehensive performance of the systems. Computational results suggest that high efficiency can be achieved by applying overlaying macrocell system when the offered traffic is low and handover priority system when it is high. Also the combined system, i.e., handover priority with overlaying macrocell system, is expected to have higher efficiency over the wide range of the offered traffic.	blocking (computing);computation;erlang (unit);profiling (computer programming);spectral efficiency	Masugi Inoue;Hiroyuki Morikawa;Moriyuki Mizumachi	1994		10.1109/VETEC.1994.345151	grade of service;spectrum;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	26.654874830639695	87.67327151386459	185510

In order to achieve effective system bandwidth allocation among four antennas, novel spectrum planning schemes for both downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) are proposed. Theoretical analysis and simulation demonstrate that the proposed cellular structure can significantly improve the system capacity in both DL and UL, especially at the cell edge.	channel capacity;simulation;telecommunications link	Weiwei Wang;Jun Cai;Zihua Guo;Changjia Chen;Xuemin Shen	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5199035	cellular network;telecommunications;computer science;directional antenna;computer network	Robotics	26.55710850644545	87.06122304137963	185689

Although in many real-world scenarios the nodes are non-uniformly distributed, the research community lacks a common approach to generate such inhomogeneities. This paper intends to go a step in this direction. We present an algorithm to create a random inhomogeneous node distribution based on a simple neighborhood-dependent thinning of a homogeneous Poisson process. We derive some useful stochastic properties of the resulting distribution (in particular the probability density of the nearest neighbor distance) and offer a reference implementation. Our goal is to enable fellow researchers to easily use inhomogeneous distributions with well-defined stochastic properties.	algorithm;randomness;reference implementation;simulation;thinning	Christian Bettstetter;Michael Gyarmati;Udo Schilcher	2007		10.1145/1298126.1298195	mathematical optimization;probability density function;poisson process;computer science;theoretical computer science;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;metrics;statistics	AI	28.714812228027117	84.10568373611882	185773

Especially, in high mobility environment, mobile WiMAX systems uses FUSC which is one of the diversity subchannelization schemes, and get frequency diversity under multipath fading channel. However, the FUSC scheme is not flexible for channel variations inherent to user's speed. In this paper, we propose dynamic subchannelization scheme under multipath fading channels which is varied with a user's speed. Simulation results show that the proposed subchannelization algorithm leads to better the system throughput as compared to conventional subchannelization scheme such as FUSC in various channel environments.	advanced mezzanine card;algorithm;multipath propagation;simulation;throughput	Jeongchan Kim;Jin-Yup Hwang;Youngnam Han	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394405	wimax;multipath propagation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;diversity scheme;computer network	Mobile	29.075344491634283	87.97078078046083	185907

We derive an exact closed-form expression of the ergodic achievable rate and examine its asymptotic behavior in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. It is demonstrated that the high SNR approximation can be much improved by a higher transmit power ratio between the base station (BS) and the D2D transmitter in the small cell setting where all users are closely located. However, in the macro cell setting in which only the D2D terminals are fairly close, the influence of the transmit power ratio becomes insignificant. In addition, we present upper and lower bounds of the ergodic achievable rate. Based on these results, we illustrate that the D2D communication cannot help in the cellular network for elevating the rate when the transmit SNR at the BS grows high. If the BS SNR is lower, then the D2D communication can effectively increase the ergodic achievable rate. Numerical results are provided to justify the correctness of the expressions and the relevant performance analysis.	approximation;correctness (computer science);ergodicity;profiling (computer programming);signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Yuyang Wang;Dan Qiao;Shi Jin;Kai-Kit Wong;Yongming Huang	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248635	telecommunications	Mobile	30.496044921913285	84.74215335618455	185997

Building penetration loss measurements of a DVB-H signal at 602 MHz are performed in 100 buildings in Belgium. Buildings are categorized in different types (office buildings, apartments, villas, mansions, row houses, stations) and the rooms are classified according to the number of outside radiated walls. The cumulative distribution function of the penetration loss is determined and lognormality is investigated. Models are developed to calculate the penetration loss as a function of the number of radiated walls. Also models for apartments as a function of the floor level are developed.

Yet, even in advanced networks that will be built using 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE), also referred to as 3GPP LTE-Advanced, or mobile WiMAX radio interface, users on the cell edge will face relatively low Signal-toInterference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR). An attractive solution for this problem is provided by multihop technologies. In this paper we consider the feasibility of Decode and Forward (DF) Relay Nodes (RNs) from 3GPP LTE-Advanced perspective. We propose a novel evaluation methodology that can be used to find a relation of RN transmission power, ratio between number of Base Stations (BSs) and RNs, and performance of the system. Evaluation of DF relays in 3GPP LTE-Advanced framework indicates a good performance gain.	compaq lte;direction finding;relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Tommaso Beniero;Simone Redana;Jyri Hämäläinen;Bernhard Raaf	2009	VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073520	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;base station;computer network	Mobile	26.69169990084997	87.62381899844358	186817

Assuming a multihop secondary network, we derive an analytical expression for the outage probability experienced by a secondary user by taking into account the effect of interference power from primary source. The developed outage probability model can be used to assess the impact of some key parameters on the reliability of the secondary user’s link in an EH-CRN. We then investigate the optimal location of the relay node in a one dimensional two-hop secondary network that minimizes the outage probability. Next, we study how the various system parameters such as energy harvesting efficiency, path loss exponent, harvest-to-transmit time duration ratio and transmit power from primary source affect the optimal relay location. The outage improvement achieved when the relay is placed at the optimum location is also investigated. Furthermore, the sensitivity of optimal relay location to the variations in position of the primary receiver is examined. Extensive simulation results are used to corroborate the analytical findings.	downtime;exponential hierarchy;interference (communication);primary source;profiling (computer programming);relay;simulation	S.

Since satellite terminals are unique in that they always point towards the geostationary satellite, interference received by the terrestrial Base Station (BS) is concentrated in a specific angular sector. The priori knowledge that all the geostationary satellite terminals are facing south for the European coverage can be used in designing a beamformer at the terrestrial BS. Based on this concept, we propose a receive beamformer at the BS to maximize the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) towards the desired user and to mitigate the interference coming from the interfering satellite terminals. The performances of Minimum Variance Distortionless (MVDR) and Linear Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) beamformers are compared for our considered scenario. It is shown that LCMV beamformer is better suited in rejecting interference even in case of Direction of Arrival (DoA) uncertainty of interfering satellite terminals as long as DoA range of the interfering sector is known to the beamformer. Furthermore, it is noted that MVDR beamformer is suitable for a large number of interferers.	adaptive beamformer;angularjs;annualized failure rate;beamforming;coexist (image);cognitive architecture;communications satellite;direction of arrival;geosynchronous satellite;interference (communication);performance;return channel;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;software propagation;telecommunications link;terrestrial television	Shree Krishna Sharma;Symeon Chatzinotas;Björn E.

Insuch systems, the characteristics of the propagation online-of-sight (LOS) radio links will fundamentally determine the system performance. In thiscontext, it is meaningful to discuss the effect onsystem design of the two commonly used propagationmodels, the two-slope model and the single-slope model.In this paper we present several methods tocompare the frequency reuse pattern and base stationseparation based on these two propagation models, andverify the importance of correct propagation modeling for efficient system design. We considerinterfering signals coming from two cochannel basestations in the first tier, and include slow fading losswhen comparing system performances.

But with this cheap solution in two-tier WCDMA systems the interference is increasing in the adjacent network. Because of interference the number of femtocells per macrocell is limited. This article analyse the downlink interference types in two-tier WCDMA network and sets up a simulation model for these femtocell generated downlink interferences. The simulation deals with the house/office wall penetration loss which is limiting the interference.

The analytical expressions for coverage probability and outage probability are derived in detail, which are functions of BS density and absolute difference between the antenna heights of BS and UE. The analytical results of coverage probability and outage probability are verified through Monte Carlo simulation. Our study shows that as the SCNs become denser, the impact of antenna heights difference on coverage and outage probability is more significant.	downtime;monte carlo method;profiling (computer programming);simulation	Nadège Poncet;Xiaojun Jing;Hui Gao;Bohan Li;Jianxiao Xie	2018	2018 15th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2018.8491202	real-time computing;user equipment;absolute difference;stochastic geometry;path loss;monte carlo method;topology;computer science;small cell;coverage probability;base station	Arch	27.688344824625652	84.16411499352255	188246

The FRF of 1 is very attrative for more improved channel throughput but the forward link capacity is rapidly decreased at the cell boundary region due to the increase in the ICI(InterCell Interference). By measuring a region-based channel capacity and deriving a closed form of blocking probability, a QoS(Quality of Service) maintenance technique and mobility model can be acquired. In the simulation, the proposed scheme demonstrates a blocking probability reduction of up to 40% compared to the cell-based link capacity scheme.	channel capacity	Sungjin Lee	2007	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e90-b.2.417	code division multiple access;frequency response;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;access control;service quality;channel capacity	Mobile	31.090821399297283	83.19564719455865	188557

However, the impact of such offloading on the uplink performance is not well understood, primarily due to the lack of tractable models. Uplink power control and spatial interference correlation further complicate the mathematical analysis as compared to the downlink. In this paper, we propose a tractable and general model to characterize the uplink SIR and rate distribution in a K-tier HCN as a function of the association and power control parameters. Using the developed analysis, it is shown that the optimal degree of channel inversion (for uplink power control) increases with load imbalance in the network. Minimum path loss association is shown to maximize uplink rate coverage. Moreover, with minimum path loss association and full channel inversion, uplink coverage is shown to be invariant of infrastructure density.	cobham's thesis;control theory;interference (communication);load balancing (computing);multitier architecture;proactive parallel suite;rain fade;telecommunications link	Sarabjot Singh;Xinchen Zhang;Jeffrey G.

But the application of RF-WPT in wireless sensor networks also introduces charging interference to wireless communications. The network lifetime maximization by jointly considering wireless charging and data transmission under interference concerns, however, has seldom been examined. In this paper, we take initial steps to consider communication and charger scheduling together in wireless sensor networks. We propose a smart interference-aware scheduling to maximize the network lifetime and avoid potential data loss caused by charging interference. The evaluation result indicates that the proposed design can guarantee 99% optimality and significantly improve network lifetime.	battery charger;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);low-power broadcasting;rf modulator;radio frequency;rechargeable battery;scheduling (computing)	Yi Qu;Ke Xu;Haiyang Wang;Dan Wang;Bo Wu	2015	2015 IEEE 34th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)	10.1109/PCCC.2015.7410265	wireless wan;wireless sensor network;wireless site survey;telecommunications;radio resource management;wireless network;maximum throughput scheduling;wireless lan controller;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;base transceiver station;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	31.716577320156784	87.18534823686116	188697
5aa4f8f6c591f0d396e1e07d39f2f86f98836e90	a novel framework for achievable secrecy throughput of distributed cognitive radio wireless networks		—The achievable secrecy throughput of the distributed cognitive radio wireless networks (DCRWNs) is investigated in this paper. The related works on the secrecy performance mainly focus on the average value depending on nodes spatial distribution. However, these results neglect the effect of nodes location on the performance discrepancies. To break this bottleneck, a new framework is developed to derive a closedform expression of the achievable secrecy throughput for the secondary network under the outage constraint of the primary network. Moreover, the nearest routing protocols is considered. Through the stochastic geometry analysis, it is shown that the new framework highlights the performance discrepancy resulting from spatial distribution. Besides, we derive the optimal value of connection outage probability of the SR network maximizing the successful transmission probability for DCRWNs.	aggregate data;cognitive radio;cooperative mimo;discrepancy function;downtime;ergodicity;interference (communication);optimization problem;relay;routing;throughput	Hongyu Ma;Kai Niu	2015	JCM	10.12720/jcm.10.6.403-409	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	29.872592831354826	84.83203307320588	188826

Taking into account the inter-cell interference, the impact of the traffic demands of users and the spatial traffic intensity on the BS power consumption are jointly considered for MISO PVT random cellular networks. Furthermore, the power consumption required at the BS in a typical PVT cell is modeled through characteristic functions. Simulation results are employed to evaluate the BS power consumption and the performance of the random cellular networks.	interference (communication);mimo;numerical method;random-access memory;simulation;system analysis;voronoi diagram	Xiaohu Ge;Peipei Song;Tarik Taleb;Tao Han;Jing Zhang;Qiang Li	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6953031	stochastic geometry models of wireless networks;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	28.465703520560652	85.37374949334774	189009

Most approaches to estimate the outage probability and the system capacity of CDMA systems in the literature do not take interference based admission control into account. In this paper, we present an analytical model to evaluate the outage probability and the capacity on the reverse link of cellular CDMA systems with interference based admission control. We make two main approximations in the outage analysis – one based on the central limit theorem (CLT) and the other based on the Chernoff bound (CB). We also obtain an improved approximation to the outage probability using Edgeworth expansion. It is shown that the considered admission control policy results in increased system capacity compared to that with no admission control, by about 30% for an outage probability of 0.01.	approximation;channel capacity;chernoff bound;control theory;downtime;interference (communication);sun outage;telecommunications link	S.

To date, FFR techniques have been typically been evaluated through system-level simulations using a hexagonal grid for the base station locations. This paper instead focuses on analytically evaluating the two main types of FFR deployments - Strict FFR and Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR) - using a Poisson point process to model the base station locations. The results are compared with the standard grid model and an actual urban deployment. Under reasonable special cases for modern cellular networks, our results reduce to simple closed-form expressions, which provide insight into system design guidelines and the relative merits of Strict FFR, SFR, universal reuse, and fixed frequency reuse.	allan variance;interference (communication);point process;simulation;software deployment;systems design	Thomas David Novlan;Radha Krishna Ganti;Jeffrey G.

1c33eb88b3168084823f3177612edd9765beb9fa	on the benefits of network-level cooperation in millimeter-wave communications		Relaying techniques for millimeter-wave wireless networks represent a powerful solution for improving the transmission performance. In this work, we quantify the benefits in terms of delay and throughput for a random-access multi-user millimeter-wave wireless network, assisted by a full-duplex network cooperative relay. The relay is equipped with a queue for which we analyze the performance characteristics (e.g., arrival rate, service rate, average size, and stability condition). Moreover, we study two possible transmission schemes: fully directional and broadcast. In the former, the source nodes transmit a packet either to the relay or to the destination by using narrow beams, whereas, in the latter, the nodes transmit to both the destination and the relay in the same timeslot by using a wider beam, but with lower beamforming gain. In our analysis, we also take into account the beam alignment phase that occurs every time a transmitter node changes the destination node. We show how the beam alignment duration, as well as position and number of transmitting nodes, significantly affect the network performance. Moreover, we illustrate the optimal transmission scheme (i.e., broadcast or fully directional) for several system parameters and show that a fully directional transmission is not always beneficial, but, in some scenarios, broadcasting and relaying can improve the performance in terms of throughput and delay.	beamforming;duplex (telecommunications);multi-user;network packet;network performance;queue (abstract data type);queueing theory;random access;relay;throughput;transmitter	Cristian Tatino;Nikolaos Pappas;Ilaria Malanchini;Lutz Ewe;Di Yuan	2018	CoRR		throughput;computer network;wireless network;distributed computing;transmitter;beamforming;relay;computer science;network packet;queue;network performance	Mobile	30.31191873796064	83.68854187458622	190121

One of the most challenging topics is how to design a reliable and efficient renewable energy powered cellular system, which consists of the energy harvesting part, the energy buffer part and the energy consumption part. Motivated by the open issue, we provide a theoretical basis for modeling and key design metrics definition and analysis of the solar energy powered small cells in Hetnet, which will be widely deployed in LTE(-A) networks. Firstly, the energy flow behavior of solar powered small cells is modeled by using the stochastic queue model, and then dynamics of the constructed model is analyzed mathematically. Secondly, three key design metrics, service outage probability (SOP), renewable energy utilization efficiency (REUE) and Mean depth of discharge (MDoD), are defined, and then closed-form expressions of them are derived. Through numerical analysis with measured data of the solar radiation and temperature, the design metrics under different conditions are illustrated vividly, and the optimal design limit is provided. The proposed modeling method and key design metrics provide a theoretical basis for actual designs of solar energy powered small cells, which also can be further applied to the scenario of other forms of renewable energy powered small cells.	blocking (computing);channel capacity;depth of discharge;discharger;downtime;erlang (unit);kolmogorov equations;numerical analysis;optimal design;queueing theory;software metric	Heng Wang;Hongjia Li;Zejue Wang;Xin Chen;Song Ci	2014	2014 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785381	electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;engineering;distributed generation;energy accounting	Mobile	28.37297180029647	85.49139712246718	191864

Although there has been significant research activity on the potential of device-to-device (D2D) communications, there are currently no clear indications of whether D2D communications are actually able to provide benefits for a wide range of operational conditions, thus justifying their introduction to the system. This paper attempts to fill this gap by taking a stochastic geometry approach on characterizing the set (region) of operational conditions for which D2D communications enhance performance in terms of average user rate. For the practically interesting case of a heavy-loaded network, the operational region is provided in closed form as a function of a variety of parameters such as maximum D2D link distances and user densities, reflecting a wide range of operational conditions (points). It is shown that, under the appropriate deployment scheme, D2D communications can indeed be beneficial not only for the usually considered regime of “proximal communications” but to a wide range of operational conditions that include D2D link distances comparable to the distance to the cellular access point and considerably large user densities.	add-ons for firefox;cylinder-head-sector;database normalization;exptime;emoticon;interference (communication);link distance;network performance;point of interest;randomness;rayleigh–ritz method;software deployment;thinning;transmitter;wireless access point	Stelios Stefanatos;Antonis G.

The analysis of coverage characteristic shows that embedding DAS instead of microcells in the macrocell makes network control and site engineering easier to be performed. Signal to interference ratio (SIR) of the macrocell/DAS is studied and compared with that of the macrocell/microcell system. Remote access unit (RAU) selection is employed to reduce the interference from the forward link in DAS.

In design of LEOS systems, the choice of satellite altitude is an important consideration, which has a significant impact on system performance. Among the factors affected by satellite altitude choice are system capacity, user-to-user delay, power system design and communication services that can be offered. This paper analyzes the effects of satellite altitude on quality of service, frequency reusability and power system sizing. It is found that a choice of low altitude has a positive impact on system capacity and power system requirements. As a consequence, satellite mass and launch cost can be reduced for satellites in lower orbits due to the lower power requirements. In terms of user-to-user delay, the results are in favor of medium altitudes, while very high altitudes are not a good choice relative to these measures.	channel capacity;delay slot;power supply;propagation time;quality of service;requirement;routing;software propagation;switching time;system requirements;systems design;teledesic	Bezalel Gavish;Joakim Kalvenes	1998	Wireless Networks	10.1023/A:1019151905814	effects of high altitude on humans;simulation;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer performance;electric power system;communications system;computer network	EDA	25.34131025976603	81.60580620868048	193521

A sound comprehension of the properties of intercell interference is the key to a meaningful assessment of communication systems without exhaustive simulation campaigns. We consider the basic access schemes TDMA, WCDMA and random OFDMA for uplink transmission. We will also give hints, how the methods can be extended to capture other access schemes, and/or additional features. The focus of this work is more on the introduction of the new methodology. In principle, we describe the intercell interference as a random variable which is composed of many other random variables. The distributions, and in particular the mutual dependencies of those have to be carefully studied. Applications and extensions of the ideas will be addressed in future work, only first examples are given here.	adaptive grammar;catastrophic interference;fairness measure;interference (communication);microsoft outlook for mac;modulation;mutual information;portable document format;scheduling (computing);semiconductor industry;simulation;statistical model;telecommunications link	Ingo Viering;Axel Klein;Michel T.

OFDMA is basically a combination of FDM and TDM, and therefore suffers from heavy inter-cell interference if neighboring basestations use the same frequency range. However, it is desirable to reuse the complete available frequency spectrum in every cell in order to maximize the resource utilization. One approach to solve this conflict is the application of beamforming antennas in combination with interference coordination mechanisms between basestations. Starting from a global interference coordination scheme with full system knowledge, we investigate how spatially limited interference coordination affects the system performance. Subsequently, we study several realizable interference coordination schemes and show that a locally implementable scheme can almost match the performance of the global scheme with respect to the sector throughput.	beamforming;catastrophic interference;compaq lte;finite difference method;frequency band;interference (communication);spectral density;throughput	Marc Necker	2007	2007 IEEE 66th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2007.368	wimax;frequency spectrum;in situ resource utilization;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer performance;computer network	Mobile	26.32133473988638	88.48731717635543	194868
5578bffa1cb1b40e21b3ee885d007eabf1f15ff2	underlay drone cell for temporary events: impact of drone height and aerial channel environments		Providing seamless connection to a large number of devices is one of the biggest challenges for the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Using a drone as an aerial base station (ABS) to provide coverage to devices or users on ground is envisaged as a promising solution for IoT networks. In this paper, we consider a communication network with an underlay ABS to provide coverage for a temporary event, such as a sporting event or a concert in a stadium. Using stochastic geometry, we propose a general analytical framework to compute the uplink and downlink coverage probabilities for both the aerial and the terrestrial cellular system. Our framework is valid for any aerial channel model for which the probabilistic functions of line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) links are specified. The accuracy of the analytical results is verified by Monte Carlo simulations considering two commonly adopted aerial channel models. Our results show the non-trivial impact of the different aerial channel environments (i.e., suburban, urban, dense urban and high-rise urban) on the uplink and downlink coverage probabilities and provide design guidelines for best ABS deployment height.	aerial photography;channel (communications);internet of things;line-of-sight (missile);monte carlo method;seamless3d;simulation;software deployment;telecommunications link;telecommunications network;terrestrial television;unmanned aerial vehicle	Xiaohui Zhou;Salman Durrani;Jing Guo;Halim Yanikomeroglu	2018	CoRR		stochastic geometry;telecommunications network;computer network;telecommunications link;probabilistic logic;drone;computer science;underlay;communication channel;base station	Mobile	27.647378939309032	84.69807603406592	195038

Government of India has an ambitious plan to connect 250,000 rural offices (Gram Panchayat) using optical fiber based point of presence (PoP); this will allay, but not solve the rural broadband coverage problem. In this work, a middle-mile multihop mesh network operating in the TV UHF band is presented as a solution to providing seamless connectivity between the Gram Panchayat and village users. This network can coexist with TV broadcasting via the License Shared Access mechanism. The main contribution of this paper is a throughput optimization tool. Given the demography information of rural areas, the desired broadband speed and contention ratio, available frequency, location of fiber PoP, and propagation path-loss models of the TV UHF band - our optimization tool computes optimal power and routing for the multihop mesh network. The analysis is performed at the physical layer. Time division multiple access and spatial reuse of frequency are used for interference management in this work. Simply put, given demography information, our optimization tool determines at what power will broadband coverage will be feasible in the rural areas. This tool's design is separable and it can be utilized in other areas of the world, where demography and path-loss models can be replaced. Our optimization tool will be exemplified using results from one demographic region in India.	algorithm;coexist (image);hill climbing;interference (communication);l band;loss function;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;middle mile;optical fiber;power optimization (eda);routing;seamless3d;software propagation;testbed;throughput;white spaces (radio);wireless access point	Animesh Kumar;Rajeev Kumar;Punit Rathod;Abhay Karandikar	2015	2015 13th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)	10.1109/WIOPT.2015.7151101	routing;telecommunications;computer science;mesh networking;interference;computer network	EDA	24.802834398506665	85.20686100823924	195319

We establish an analytical expression of the SINR (Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio) of user equipments (UE), by using a 3D fluid model approach of the network. This model enables to evaluate in a simple way the cumulative distribution function of the SINR, and therefore the performance, the quality of service and the coverage of wireless networks, with a high accuracy. The use of this 3D wireless network model, instead of a standard two-dimensional one, in order to analyze wireless networks, is particularly interesting. Indeed, this 3D model enables to establish more accurate performance and quality of services results than a 2D one.	interference (communication);monte carlo method;network model;quality of service;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;verification and validation	Jean Marc Kelif;Marceau Coupechoux	2016	CoRR		multi-frequency network;stochastic geometry models of wireless networks;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications;radio resource management;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Mobile	27.99622881269658	84.97321202721551	196107

This flexible base station placement creates significant overlapping coverage areas that can be utilized to improve system performance [1]. A new technique for dynamic base station selection in systems with overlapping cells is considered and its effect on traffic performance is characterized. The technique realizes robust performance for personal communication systems in fluctuating and heavily tapered traffic. A mathematical analysis based on a state transition model is used to evaluate performance of a system that employs the proposed technique. The results indicate that improved blocking probability and carried traffic performance are obtainable.

This TV spectrum will mitigate the shortage of wireless spectrum resources and provide opportunities for new applications. TVWS differ from the conventional Wi-Fi spectrum in three aspects: spectrum fragmentation, spatial variation, and temporal variation. These differences make the network design over TVWS challenging and fundamentally different from Wi-Fi networks. While most prior works on TVWS network design focused on outdoor large-area scenario, the important indoor scenario is largely open for investigation. In this paper, we present WINET (for White-space Indoor NETwork), the first design framework for indoor multi-AP white space network. We optimize AP placement, spectrum allocation, and AP association. Spectrum fragmentation, spatial variation, and temporal variation are all tackled in our network design. We build a test-bed and conduct extensive measurements inside an office building across four months to obtain real-world traces. Experimental results show that WINET can increase AP coverage area by an average of 62.2% and obtain 67.9% higher system throughput while achieving fairness among users as compared to alternative approaches.	fairness measure;fragmentation (computing);frequency allocation;np-completeness;network planning and design;software deployment;system deployment;testbed;throughput;tracing (software);white spaces (radio);zhi-li zhang	Jincheng Zhang;Wenjie Zhang;Minghua Chen;Zhi Wang	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)	10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218431	simulation;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	25.088402436161378	85.07708241449672	197216

Power control is needed to reduce interference by reducing the effects of near-far problem, co-channel interference and fading channels. WCDMA system is required power control that works fast and precisely because radio channels are changing randomly. Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm (FGA) gives the correct solution to the dynamic decision making problem under non-linear conditions, based on simple rules. This paper presents application of adaptive SIR based power control using the FGA on uplink WCDMA system, and compared to fixed step size method using computer simulation. The results confirmed that use of FGA on the SIR-based Power Control for WCDMA systems increases the number of active users while maintaining QoS standards. This is shown by the decline in value of outage probability compared to fixed step methods. Average outage probability at fixed power control step is 0.270036 while the FGA power control is 0.18465.	computer simulation;downtime;genetic algorithm;interference (communication);nonlinear system;profiling (computer programming);quality of service;randomness;telecommunications link	Firdaus;Ali Muayyadi;Rina Puji Astuti	2012	2012 Second International Conference on Digital Information and Communication Technology and it's Applications (DICTAP)	10.1109/DICTAP.2012.6215374	computer simulation;genetic algorithm;adaptive control;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;fading	EDA	30.59029056080071	88.35340972687065	197527

d7f2b4c421165d15d9d7b046139273622342b2dc	spectrum database-assisted radio propagation prediction for wireless distributed networks: a geostatistical approach		The concern over wireless distributed networks (WDNs) such as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) systems and Internet of Things (IoT) has risen. In massive WDNs, it is important to strictly manage the interference power among wireless links: radio propagation prediction between distributed terminals is a critical issue for highly efficient spectrum use. In this paper, we propose a novel radio propagation estimation using spectrum database which collects communication results from mobile terminals. The proposed method focuses on the spatial-correlation of radio propagation characteristics between different wireless links. Using maximum likelihood-based pathloss estimation and Kriging-based shadowing estimation, the radio propagation of the wireless link that has arbitrary location relationship can be predicted. From numerical results, it is shown that the proposed method achieves higher estimation accuracy than the conventional pathloss-based estimation methods. Furthermore, we show that the proposed technique can predict the probability density function (PDF) of the estimation error.	error message;interference (communication);internet of things;kriging;machine to machine;mathematical structure;numerical analysis;numerical method;portable document format;propagation constant;software propagation	Koya Sato;Kei Inage;Takeo Fujii	2016	2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794768	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;radio propagation model;computer network	Mobile	28.419928190546027	84.35958601549571	198099

Consideration of all requirements of future packet-switched networks, especially the impact of scheduling, leads to extensive system level simulations that have to be performed in order to obtain the cell throughput. A semi-analytical methodology is proposed in this paper that is able to give average cell throughput estimates for given network layouts without performing extensive system level simulations. The signal to interference ratio (SIR) probability density function (pdf) which reflects the behavior that is achieved after scheduling of users is derived. Based on the SIR pdf, probabilities for the usage of modulation and coding schemes are obtained and the average cell throughput is calculated.  Results are presented for well known scheduling algorithms and a channel model that is valid for networks utilizing frequency diversity by distributing the subcarriers over the whole system bandwidth like the partial usage of subchannels (PUSC) mode in IEEE 802.16e. It is shown that the average cell throughput estimates are within 10 % of the average cell throughput that is obtained by system level simulations which model all the properties including scheduling in detail. Due to the usage of analytical expressions, results can be obtained in less than a minute for the proposed methodology while a system level simulation usually takes several hours.	algorithm;channel (communications);interference (communication);modulation;network packet;packet switching;portable document format;requirement;scheduling (computing);semiconductor industry;simulation;subcarrier;throughput	Andreas Fernekeß;Anja Klein;Bernhard Wegmann;Karl Dietrich	2009		10.1145/1582379.1582704	fair-share scheduling;probability density function;real-time computing;signal-to-interference ratio;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;maximum throughput scheduling;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;statistics;computer network	Mobile	27.205470330506497	85.78471073483884	198294

In this paper, the performance of fixed frequency reuse with different reuse factors is studied in LTE-Advanced systems. Performance is measured in terms of both average cell throughput and cell edge user throughput. It is found that a properly chosen reuse factor with respect to cell size (which leads to different level of inter-cell interference), can offer up to 30% gain in average cell throughput and much higher gain for cell-edge user throughput in Local Area (LA). This high gain from frequency reuse makes it attractive for future LTE-Advanced systems.	compaq lte;interference (communication);throughput;uncompressed video	Yuanye Wang;Sanjay Kumar;Luis Guilherme Uzeda Garcia;Klaus I.

The extremely growing mobile market, together with the arising demand for high data rates, force to off-load the main cellular network traffic. This can be accomplished by deploying small cells within the macro evolved-node base-station (eNodeB) coverage. Thus, more User Equipments (UEs) in the same geographical area can be served simultaneously. To achieve high spectral efficiency in the small-cell deployment, one solution is to reuse the available spectrum and consider interference coordination between the macro and small cells. Another solution is to deploy small cells operating in different frequency band (either licensed or unlicensed) in the Millimeter (mm)Wave range. For this reason, the mmWave band can be considered at the small-cells ensuring no interference while off-loading the macro cells. In this paper, we propose a coexistence approach for enhancing the spectral efficiency in heterogeneous ultra-dense networks (UDN) and demonstrate it with system level analysis. The proposed approach depends on deploying small cells that operate in the mmWave range. Henceforth, avoiding the interference problem between the macro eNodeB and the small cells.	blu-ray;channel state information;coexist (image);expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency band;geographic coordinate system;greedy algorithm;interference (communication);multi-user;network traffic control;nyquist rate;scenario (computing);semantic network;semiconductor industry;software deployment;sparse matrix;spectral efficiency	Haitham Abbas;Mohamed Shehata;Khaled S.

In the overlaid cell structure, eICIC (enhanced Inter-Cell Interference Coordination) is an essential technique to avoid the interference between the macro cells and the small cells when co- channel deployment is used. Because eICIC conducts interference coordination in the time domain, accurate timing synchronization is required between the macro cells and the small cells. We have proposed a network-listening based synchronization method, which enables accurate synchronization even indoors without receiving GPS signal. In the proposed method, a small-cell eNB receives a macro- cell downlink synchronization signal and establishes synchronization with the macro-cell eNB. However, we need to update synchronization periodically and receive a macro-cell signal even while there is a loop-back interference signal from the small-cell eNB itself. In order to solve the problem, we have proposed a method to mute the transmission and avoid loop-back self-interference. Although this works well, it is an issue that the spectral efficiency is deteriorated by the signal stopping. In this paper, we propose a synchronization method that cancels loop-back self-interference without stopping the transmission of small-cell eNB and clarify the effect of the proposed method by computer simulations and laboratory experiments using the first-ever prototype system.	cell signaling;computer simulation;experiment;gps signals;global positioning system;interference (communication);loopback;mute;prototype;software deployment;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Sho Nabatame;Mitsukuni Konishi;Atsushi Nagate;Teruya Fujii	2016	2016 IEEE 84th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7880901	synchronization;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;self-clocking signal;interference	EDA	25.37134131648898	86.55974433848635	198909

The multi-link MIMO system transmits different signals to a mobile station by using plural base stations with multiple antennas. The system improves not only area coverage but also spectrum efficiency. Here water filling power allocation strategy is used to optimize the capacity of the multi-link MIMO channel. This paper focuses on the downlink channel and presents single-user performance of the system. The performance is evaluated by area coverage that is, the percentage of the locations where the capacity exceeds the target value. The presence of Rayleigh fading, shadow fading, and path loss is assumed in this paper. Our numerical results showed that the area coverage of the multi-link MIMO systems with equal power allocation was greatly improved compared with that of conventional single-link MIMO systems. However, when the capacity of MIMO channel was optimized by water filling power allocation strategy, the performance improvement with multi-link was reduced compared with that of using equal power allocation. In the case of (3,1) and (6, 3) MIMO systems, there were regions that single-link MIMO outperformed multi-link MIMO systems.	mimo;multi-user;numerical analysis;rayleigh fading;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Akiyo Yoshimoto;Takeshi Hattori	2007	2007 IEEE 66th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2007.246	spectrum;electronic engineering;multi-user mimo;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;path loss;base station;rayleigh fading;water filling algorithm;mobile station;spatial multiplexing;computer network;mimo	HPC	30.238673289705073	83.44444799186971	199136
fe9b5dc6231d1fae82b7f7d8970840ecfa01e63c	optimization of primary exclusive region in spatial grid-based spectrum database using stochastic geometry		In database-driven spectrum sharing for 5G mobile networks, a primary user (PU) may experience harmful interference caused by unpredictable propagation paths, even when secondary users (SUs) follow a spectrum sharing policy established on the basis of a database. A framework for determining the optimal radius of a circular primary exclusive region (PER) on the basis of SU's information has been proposed. However, a practical PER can be complex-shaped and should be designed on the basis of the directivity of the PU antenna, and the SU information in each region. In this paper, we present a stochastic geometry analysis in a spatial grid-based spectrum database, and propose a design for an optimal complex-shaped PER. The database determines the transmission probability of the SUs on each divided annular sector. By regarding the SU's locations on each annular sector as an inhomogeneous Poisson point process, we analytically derive a PU's outage probability (OP), where the PU's OP is defined as the probability that the aggregate interference power at a PU from the SUs exceeds a threshold. Using the derived expression, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the number of transmitting SUs, which optimizes the SU's transmission probability on each annular sector. Then, we numerically evaluate the solution of the optimization problem in various scenarios. The results show that the accuracy of the PER improves as the grid size decreases. In addition, we successfully design a complex-shaped PER with holes in which the SUs are permitted to transmit.	aggregate data;downtime;grid (spatial index);ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;one-class classification;optimization problem;point process;point-to-point protocol;software propagation;superuser;transmitter	Shota Yamashita;Koji Yamamoto;Takayuki Nishio;Masahiro Morikura	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7997000	directivity;stochastic geometry;grid;cognitive radio;outage probability;database;poisson point process;interference (wave propagation);computer science;optimization problem	Vision	28.792026246296725	85.8228380437546	199792
