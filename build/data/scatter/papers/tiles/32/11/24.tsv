185c811f94c6526c50dcf3da0aff78fe032a27f7	multiparty differential privacy via aggregation of locally trained classifiers		As increasing amounts of sensitive personal information finds its way into data repositories, it is important to develop analysis mechanisms that can derive aggregate information from these repositories without revealing information about individual data instances. Though the differential privacy model provides a framework to analyze such mechanisms for databases belonging to a single party, this framework has not yet been considered in a multi-party setting. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving protocol for composing a differentially private aggregate classifier using classifiers trained locally by separate mutually untrusting parties. The protocol allows these parties to interact with an untrusted curator to construct additive shares of a perturbed aggregate classifier. We also present a detailed theoretical analysis containing a proof of differential privacy of the perturbed aggregate classifier and a bound on the excess risk introduced by the perturbation. We verify the bound with an experimental evaluation on a real dataset.	aggregate data;aggregate function;database;differential privacy;download;offset binary;personally identifiable information;utility functions on indivisible goods	Manas A.

8f0d594c653edf203cf2dc8441a7ccb7d45a4b2e	privacy preserving mechanisms for optimizing cross-organizational collaborative decisions based on the karmarkar algorithm		Abstract Cross-organizational collaborative decision-making involves a great deal of private information which companies are often reluctant to disclose, even when they need to analyze data collaboratively. The lack of effective privacy-preserving mechanisms for optimizing cross-organizational collaborative decisions has become a challenge for both researchers and practitioners. It is even more challenging in the era of big data, since data encryption and decryption inevitably increase the complexity of calculation. In order to address this issue, in this study we introduce the Karmarkar algorithm as a way of dealing with the privacy-preserving distributed linear programming (LP) needed for secure multi-party computation (SMC) and secure two-party computation (STC) in scenarios characterised by mutual distrust and semi-honest participants without the aid of a trusted third party. We conduct two simulations to test the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed protocols by revising the Karmarkar algorithm. The first simulation indicates that the proposed protocol can obtain the same outcome values compared to no-encryption algorithms. Our second simulation shows that the computational time in the proposed protocol can be reduced, especially for a high-dimensional constraint matrix (e.g., from 100 × 100 to 1000 × 1000). As such, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency that can be achieved in the revised Karmarkar algorithm when it is applied in SMC. The proposed protocols can be used for collaborative optimization as well as privacy protection. Our simulations highlight the efficiency of the proposed protocols for large data sets in particular.	karmarkar's algorithm	Hui Zhu;Hongwei Liu;Carol Xiaojuan Ou;Robert M.

Recent study shows that personal information in supposedly anonymous movie rating records are de-identified. The survey rating data usually contains both ratings of sensitive and non-sensitive issues. The ratings of sensitive issues involve personal privacy. Even though the survey participants do not reveal any of their ratings, their survey records are potentially identifiable by using information from other public sources. None of the existing anonymisation principles (e.g., k-anonymity, l-diversity, etc.) can effectively prevent such breaches in large survey rating data sets. We tackle the problem by defining a principle called $${(k,\epsilon)}$$ -anonymity model to protect privacy. Intuitively, the principle requires that, for each transaction t in the given survey rating data T, at least (k − 1) other transactions in T must have ratings similar to t, where the similarity is controlled by $${\epsilon}$$ . The $${(k,\epsilon)}$$ -anonymity model is formulated by its graphical representation and a specific graph-anonymisation problem is studied by adopting graph modification with graph theory. Various cases are analyzed and methods are developed to make the updated graph meet $${(k,\epsilon)}$$ requirements. The methods are applied to two real-life data sets to demonstrate their efficiency and practical utility.	anonymous blog;approximation algorithm;attribute grammar;dimensionality reduction;edge dominating set;experiment;graph theory;graphical user interface;np-hardness;personally identifiable information;privacy;real life;requirement	Xiaoxun Sun;Hua Wang;Jiuyong Li;Jian Pei	2010	Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery	10.1007/s10618-010-0208-4	computer science;graph theory;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web;educational assessment;statistics	Security	-40.244799496185536	63.37241296285262	178534

It is important to adopt a particular trust structure or PKI model at an early stage as this forms a basis for the PKI’s development. Many PKI models have been proposed but use only natural language descriptions. We apply a simple formal approach to describe the essential factors of a PKI model. Rule sets for some PKI models are given and can be used to distinguish and classify the different PKI models. Advantages for this approach with conglomerate PKIs, those that are built from multiple distinct PKI models, are discussed.	algorithm;identifier;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;secure digital	Marie Henderson;Robert S.

d0816d347ac07affe0f39d5d3760e4f47aca3cd5	privacy-preserving collaborative model learning: the case of word vector training		Nowadays, machine learning is becoming a new paradigm for mining hidden knowledge in big data. The collection and manipulation of big data not only create considerable values, but also raise serious privacy concerns. To protect the huge amount of potentially sensitive data, a straightforward approach is to encrypt data with specialized cryptographic tools. However, it is challenging to utilize or operate on encrypted data, especially to perform machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the problem of training high quality word vectors over large-scale encrypted data (from distributed data owners) with the privacy-preserving collaborative neural network learning algorithms. We leverage and also design a suite of arithmetic primitives (e.g., multiplication, fixed-point representation, sigmoid function computation, etc.) on encrypted data, served as components of our construction. We theoretically analyze the security and efficiency of our proposed construction, and conduct extensive experiments on representative real-world datasets to verify its practicality and effectiveness.	algorithm;artificial neural network;big data;computation;cryptography;display resolution;encryption;experiment;machine learning;privacy;programming paradigm;sigmoid function;word embedding	Qian Wang;Minxin Du;Yanjiao Chen;Xiaofeng Chen;Pan Zhou;Xinyi Huang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering	10.1109/TKDE.2018.2819673	artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;computer science;computation;artificial neural network;big data;encryption;collaborative model;cryptography;multiplication;server	DB	-37.134362065185464	65.41872131461481	178864

A common strategy, referred to as obfuscation, to protect location privacy is based on forwarding the LSB provider a coarse user location instead of the actual user location. Conventional approaches, based on such technique, are however based only on geometric methods and therefore are unable to assure privacy when the adversary is aware of the geographical context. This paper provides a comprehensive solution to this problem. Our solution presents a novel approach that obfuscates the user location by taking into account the geographical context and user's privacy preferences. We define several theoretical notions underlying our approach. We then propose a strategy for generating obfuscated spaces and an efficient algorithm which implements such a strategy. The paper includes several experimental results assessing performance, storage requirements and accuracy for the approach. The paper also discusses the system architecture and shows that the approach can be deployed also for clients running on small devices.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;least significant bit;location-based service;privacy;requirement;systems architecture	Maria Luisa Damiani;Elisa Bertino;Claudio Silvestri	2009		10.1145/1667502.1667511	computer science;location-based service;data mining;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;remote sensing;systems architecture	Security	-40.86495465009363	60.56705958830919	179261

We propose an attack on the privacy of the published sanitized data that simply fuses outputs of multiple data miners that are applied to the sanitized data. That attack is practical and does not require any background or additional information. We use a number of experiments to show scenarios where an adversary can combine outputs of multiple miners using a simple fusion strategy to increase their success chance of breaching privacy of individuals whose data is stored in the database. The fusion attack provides a powerful method of breaching privacy in the form of partial disclosure, for both anonymized and perturbed data. It also provides an effective way of approximating predictions of the best miner (a miner that provides the best results among all considered miners) when this miner cannot be determined.	adversary (cryptography);code injection;data mining;experiment;information sensitivity;privacy;sanitization (classified information)	Michal Sramka;Reihaneh Safavi-Naini;Jörg Denzinger	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops	10.1109/ICDMW.2009.28	fuse;prediction;power iteration;information privacy;computer science;noise;data mining;database;privacy;computer security	DB	-40.3998688438181	64.07269160993006	180234

Despite its great success, today's SSL deployment is largely limited to security-critical domains. The low adoption rate of SSL is mainly due to high computation overhead on the server side.  In this paper, we propose Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) as a new source of computing power to reduce the server-side overhead. We have designed and implemented an SSL proxy that opportunistically offloads cryptographic operations to GPUs. The evaluation results show that our GPU implementation of cryptographic operations, RSA, AES, and HMAC-SHA1, achieves high throughput while keeping the latency low. The SSL proxy significantly boosts the throughput of SSL transactions, handling 21.5K SSL transactions per second, and has comparable response time even when overloaded.	computation;cryptography;graphics processing unit;hash-based message authentication code;internet;overhead (computing);proxy server;rsa (cryptosystem);response time (technology);sha-1;server (computing);server-side;software deployment;throughput;transactions per second;transport layer security	Keon Jang;Sangjin Han;Seungyeop Han;Sue B.

The design includes a new data model that well represents a variety of small volume tickets, a role-based access control applied to each ticket, and a logging and rollback operations externalized in a way interacting with a preprocessor. We present that database functionality on a smartcard are helpful to build multi-party ticket applications.

For example, a health application might compute a model relating exercise and diet to amount of weight loss. While the ultimately computed model could be public, the individual input and output data traces used to construct it may be private data of participants (e.g., their individual food intake, lifestyle choices, and resulting weight). This paper proposes and experimentally studies a technique that attempts to keep such input and output data traces private, while allowing accurate model construction. This is significantly different from perturbation-based techniques in that no noise is added. The main contribution of the paper is to show a certain data transformation at the client side that helps keeping the client data private while not introducing any additional error to model construction. We particularly focus on linear regression models which are widely used in participatory sensing applications. We use the data set from a map-based participatory sensing service to evaluate our scheme. The service in question is a green navigation service that constructs regression models from participant data to predict the fuel consumption of vehicles on road segments. We evaluate our proposed mechanism by providing empirical evidence that: i) an individual data trace is generally hard to reconstruct with any reasonable accuracy, and ii) the regression model constructed using the transformed traces has a much smaller error than one based on additive data-perturbation schemes.	client-side;experiment;information privacy;input/output;location-based service;participatory sensing;tracing (software);utility functions on indivisible goods	Hossein Ahmadi;Nam Pham;Raghu K.

However, potentially uneven conditions imposed (by heterogeneous, overlapping environments) and a high degree of user autonomy pose long-term challenges for mobile application design and implementation. In this context, service discovery protocols can be used as a building block to foster peer collaboration, allowing user-provided services to be found and used. Promoting user collaboration, in turn, raises issues regarding security and privacy. Interacting peers (i.e. users) may belong to multiple domains, and authentication cannot always rely on an infrastructure provided by an administrative domain.

Mix-zones break the continuity of location exposure by ensuring that users' movements cannot be traced while they reside in a mix-zone. In this paper we provide an overview of various known attacks that make mix-zones on road networks vulnerable and illustrate a set of counter measures to make road network mix-zones attack resilient. Concretely, we categorize the vulnerabilities of road network mix-zones into two classes: one due to the road network characteristics and user mobility, and the other due to the temporal, spatial and semantic correlations of location queries. For instance, the timing information of users' entry and exit into a mix-zone provides information to launch a timing attack. The non-uniformity in the transitions taken at the road intersection may lead to transition attack. An example query correlation attack is the basic continual query (CQ) attacks, which attempt to break the anonymity of road network aware mix-zones by performing query correlation based inference. The CQ-timing attacks carry out inference attacks based on both query correlation and timing correlation, and the CQ-transition attacks execute inference attacks based on both query correlation and transition correlation. We study the factors that impact on the effectiveness of each of these attacks and evaluate the efficiency of the counter measures, such as non-rectangle mix-zones and delay tolerant mix-zones, through extensive experiments on traces produced by GTMobiSim at different scales of geographic maps.	categorization;circuit complexity;cloud computing;conjunctive query;correlation attack;experiment;ibm notes;institute for computer sciences, social informatics and telecommunications engineering;location-based service;map;privacy;scott continuity;tracing (software);vulnerability (computing)	Balaji Palanisamy;Ling Liu;Kisung Lee;Aameek Singh;Yuzhe Tang	2012	2012 8th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks (MSN)	10.1109/MSN.2012.27	information privacy;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-40.37122765835849	61.00282123852067	184421

Although users can enjoy a lot of flexibility and conveniences from the LBS with IoT, they may also lose their privacy. Untrusted or malicious LBS servers with all users information can track users in various ways or release personal data to third parties. In this work, we first analyze the current dummy-location selection (DLS) algorithman efficient location privacy preservation approach and design an attack algorithm for DLS (ADLS) for test emerging IoT security. For efficiently preserving useru0027s location privacy, we propose a novel dummy location privacy-preserving (DLP) algorithm by considering both computational costs and various privacy requirements of different users. Extensive simulation experiments have been carried out to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed schemes. Evaluation results show that the ADLS algorithm has a high probability of identifying the useru0027s real location out from chosen dummy locations in the DLS algorithm. Our proposed DLP algorithm has clear advantages over the DLS algorithm in term of lower probability of revealing the useru0027s real location and improved computational cost and efficiency (i.e., time, speed, accuracy, and complexity) while preserve the same privacy level as DLS algorithm.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;dls format;digital light processing;dummy variable (statistics);experiment;internet of things;location-based service;malware;personally identifiable information;privacy;requirement;simulation;smartphone;social network	Gang Sun;Victor I.

9d5d3fa5bc48de89c398042236b85566f433eb5c	anonymous coinjoin transactions with arbitrary values		Bitcoin, the arguably most popular cryptocurrency to date, allows users to perform transactions using freely chosen pseudonymous addresses. Previous research, however, suggests that these pseudonyms can easily be linked, implying a lower level of privacy than originally expected. To obfuscate the links between pseudonyms, different mixing methods have been proposed. One of the first approaches is the CoinJoin concept, where multiple users merge their transactions into one larger transaction. In theory, CoinJoin can be used to mix and transact bitcoins simultaneously, in one step. Yet, it is expected that differing bitcoin amounts would allow an attacker to derive the original single transactions. Solutions based on CoinJoin therefore prescribe the use of fixed bitcoin amounts and cannot be used to perform arbitrary transactions.In this paper, we define a model for CoinJoin transactions and metrics that allow conclusions about the provided anonymity. We generate and analyze CoinJoin transactions and show that with differing, representative amounts they generally do not provide any significant anonymity gains. As a solution to this problem, we present an output splitting approach that introduces sufficient ambiguity to effectively prevent linking in CoinJoin transactions. Furthermore, we discuss how this approach could be used in Bitcoin today.	algorithm;bitcoin;coinjoin;cryptocurrency;heuristic (computer science);mix;mixing (mathematics);multi-user;peer-to-peer;privacy;pseudonymity	Felix Konstantin Maurer;Till Neudecker;Martin Florian	2017	2017 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ICESS	10.1109/Trustcom/BigDataSE/ICESS.2017.280	anonymity;merge (version control);public-key cryptography;computer security;cryptocurrency;obfuscation;internet privacy;computer science;ambiguity;telematics;database transaction	Security	-38.66905466135486	63.91171765541095	185633

However, knowledge of the location can be used by an adversary to physically locate the person, leading to the risk of physical harm, as well as possible leakage of certain personal information. This has serious consequences on privacy. The concept of location kanonymity has been proposed to address this. Under this notion of anonymity, the adversary only has the knowledge that the LBS request is originating from a region containing at least k people, and therefore cannot individually distinguish the user. However, the existing anonymity models ignore the movement information of mobile users, assuming that it has no impact on privacy. Thus, existing work cannot ensure complete privacy while serving advanced type of LBS requests that require information about direction as well as speed of motion. We denote such LBS services as directional LBS. The key observation we make in this paper is that, in addition to the user’s location, the user’s movement direction should also be considered to ensure true anonymization. In this paper, we extend the notion of location k-anonymity by incorporating user’s moving direction into the anonymization process while serving directional LBS. Specifically, our anonymization methods generalize both location and direction to the extent specified by the user. Our experimental results demonstrate that such anonymization can be achieved with marginal increase in computational cost when compared to the traditional location kanonymity, while providing increased anonymity. a 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In many cases, the user is asked if either all or none of their data can be shared. We hypothesize that in some cases, users would like to share data in more complex ways. In order to implement the sharing of data using more complicated privacy preferences, complex data sharing policies must be used. These complex sharing policies require more space to store than a simple """"all or nothing"""" approach to data sharing. In this paper, we present a new probabilistic data structure, called the Min Mask Sketch, to efficiently store these complex data sharing policies. We describe an implementation for the Min Mask Sketch in PostgreSQL and analyze the practicality and feasibility of using a probabilistic data structure for storing complex data sharing policies."""	adobe flash player;data structure;database;maxima and minima;paint tool sai;postgresql;random-access memory;sketch	Stephen Smart;Christan Grant	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IRI)	10.1109/IRI.2017.23	data mining;information privacy;probabilistic logic;computer science;software;database;data sharing;complex data type;data structure;sketch	DB	-38.81983192619131	66.94812354957672	186648

In fact, with various types of data available, keyword searches can not only be texts but also any other digital information, such as location, time, and price, etc. Currently, diverse search, which combines textual and digital keywords, has been studied over plaintext, i.e., unencrypted cloud data. However, it is challenging to develop a diverse search over encrypted cloud data. To address this issue, in the paper, we leverage the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) technique to design a diverse multi-keyword ranked search scheme over encrypted cloud data. Specifically, we put the digital keywords and textual keywords together in one index and use only one set of keys to encrypt the combined index. Security analysis indicates that our proposed scheme can achieve textual keyword privacy, digital keyword privacy and trapdoor unlinkability. Functionality analysis shows that our proposed scheme can achieve textual keyword search, coordinate matching, digital keyword search and range query. Performance evaluation demonstrates that our proposed scheme is efficient in terms of index construction, trapdoor generation and query.	cloud computing;computation;digital data;information security;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;performance evaluation;plaintext;range query (database);range searching;search algorithm;trapdoor function	Hongwei Li;Hao Ren;Hongxian Yao;Hao Chen;Guowen Xu;Yuan-Shun Dai	2015	2015 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2015.7448586	cloud computing;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;information retrieval	DB	-40.3318973972753	67.18256216545026	187486

It can be done in several ways. Hiding of sensitive patterns is one such important method. In a typical scenario, multiple parties may wish to collaborate to extract interesting global patterns from their integrated data items without revealing their respective local data to each other. Typical applications include finance, medical research, retail sales etc. In certain cases, there may be some patterns whose co-occurrence may lead to revelation of sensitive information. In the present work, hiding of co-occurring sensitive patterns dynamically from distributed progressive databases has been proposed. In addition in the proposed work dynamic priorities have also been coupled, along with the items. This helps to decide which patterns to hide from the set of sensitive patterns. The various partitioning scenarios for distributed databases that have been used include horizontal, vertical and arbitrary. In all such cases, the data is distributive progressive in nature i.e., old data items may become obsolete whereas new data items may be treated as more significant.		Bettahally N.

A big part of XML processing cost is caused by the processing of the structure of the documents. By structure we refer to the entity resulted from an XML document after removing the text nodes and attribute values of the document. While XML is a flexible, extensible language, real-world data exchanged in XML often exhibit some degree of stability in its organization. In other words, a computer receiving an XML data item of certain structure is likely to encounter the same structure among future data items. Since most structure-related processing is identical for data items with identical structure, it is thus evident that the overall performance of XML processing will improve if redundancy in structure related processing can be reduced. In this paper we present the concept of structure encoding and the approaches to quickly identifying recurring structures, including one relying on collision-resistant hash function. The paper then describes in detail techniques to improving the performance of XML transmission, tokenization, parsing, and transformation by using structure encoding. Evaluation experiments with our prototype implementation and industry benchmark suite demonstrate huge performance improvement potential in the presence of structure recurrence: up to 7 times faster for DOM-style parsing, up to 38 times faster for transformation, and up to 97.4% in size reduction when 20% of the text and attribute values change. In the worst case when there is no structure recurrence, structure encoding causes an overhead of about 11.1% for DOM-style parsing and about 8.9% for transformation.	access network;benchmark (computing);best, worst and average case;collision resistance;data item;document object model;experiment;extensible programming;hash function;overhead (computing);parsing;prototype;tokenization (data security);xml	Dong Zhou	2008	2008 Eighth International Conference on Web Engineering	10.1109/ICWE.2008.46	xml validation;simple api for xml;xml;computer science;xml framework;xml database;xml schema;database;xml signature;programming language;world wide web;information retrieval;efficient xml interchange	DB	-38.00857887438751	67.4496232714259	190891

Strategyproofness is a central property in the design of such mechanisms, allowing participants to maximize their individual benefit by reporting truthful private information about preferences and capabilities and without modeling or reasoning about the behavior of other agents. But, why should participants trust that a mechanism is strategyproof? We address this problem, proposing and describing a passive verifier, able to monitor the inputs and outputs of mechanisms and verify the strategyproofness, or not, of a mechanism. Useful guarantees are available to participants before the behavior of the mechanism is completely known, and metrics are introduced to provide a measure of partial verification.

Secure and efficient data processing and mining on such outsourced private data becomes a primary concern for users, especially with the push of cloud computing which has both resource and compute scalability. Among the building blocks of secure data mining algorithms, secure scalar product is used to calculate the sum of the products of the corresponding values of two vectors. Existing privacy preserving methods assume data is stored at the user side, and users follow a protocol to perform privacy preserving scalar product. However, such methods are not applicable as data now is outsourced to a centralized server in its encrypted form. To solve this problem, in this paper, we design a novel Protocol for Outsourced Scalar Product (POSP) that performs collaborative operations between server and users to produce the scalar product result without violating each user's data privacy. We proved that POSP can return the correct result and is secure. We also analysed that POSP has linear complexity in terms of space, computation, and communication with respect to the vector length.	algorithm;centralized computing;cloud computing;computation;computational complexity theory;computer data storage;data mining;encryption;information privacy;k-means clustering;outsourcing;overhead (computing);plaintext;response time (technology);scalability;scalar processor;server (computing);weight function	Fang Liu;Wee Keong Ng;Wei Zhang	2014	2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing	10.1109/CLOUD.2014.53	protocol;cloud computing;dot product;computer science;operating system;data mining;database;internet privacy	DB	-40.23200098203858	66.74571711650103	191132

Despite the tremendous benefits, outsourcing data to the commercial public cloud also opens the door for unsolicited data access in the cloud and beyond. Thus, enabling a secure and effective cloud data utilization service is of paramount importance. Given the large number of data users and huge amount of outsourced cloud data, this problem is particularly challenging as it is extremely difficult to also meet the practical requirements of performance, system usability, and high-level user searching experiences. This article investigates these challenges and in particular defines the problem of fuzzy keyword search over encrypted cloud data, which aims at accommodating various typos and representation inconsistencies in different user searching input for acceptable system usability and overall user searching experience, while protecting keyword privacy. In order to further enrich the application spectrum, we also demonstrate how the notion of fuzzy search naturally supports similarity search, a fundamental and powerful tool that is widely used in information retrieval. We describe the challenges that are not yet met by existing techniques, and discuss the research directions and possible technical approaches for these new search functionalities to become a reality.	approximate string matching;cloud computing;computer data storage;data access;data center;encryption;high- and low-level;information privacy;information retrieval;outsourcing;programming paradigm;requirement;search algorithm;similarity search;usability	Kui Ren;Xinyu Wang;Qian Wang	2012	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2012.6375896	cloud computing security;cloud computing;information privacy;computer science;cryptography;data virtualization;operating system;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;fuzzy control system;computer network	DB	-40.822902070784515	66.12886242877177	191295

Uncertainty refers to the property that the attacker cannot tell which private value, among a group of values, an individual actually has, and indistinguishability refers to the property that the attacker cannot see the difference among a group of individuals. While uncertainty has been well studied and applied to many scenarios, to date, the only effort in providing indistinguishability has been the well-known notion of k-anonymity. However, k-anonymity only applies to anonymized tables. This paper defines indistinguishability for general situations based on the symmetry among the possible private values associated with individuals. The paper then discusses computational complexities of and provides practical algorithms for checking whether a set of database views provides enough indistinguishability.	acm sigact;acm transactions on database systems;algorithm;analysis of algorithms;association rule learning;authorization;branch and price;clique cover;computer security;data anonymization;data cube;data mining;database theory;heuristic;information privacy;integer programming;knowledge-based systems;linear programming;microdata (html);mitchell corporation;olap cube;partition problem;perturbation theory;polynomial;privacy;randomness;sigkdd;symposium on principles of database systems;vldb;view (sql);whole earth 'lectronic link;yao graph;zero suppression	Chao Yao;Lingyu Wang;Xiaoyang Sean Wang;Sushil Jajodia	2006		10.1007/11844662_1	theoretical computer science;ciphertext indistinguishability;data mining;mathematics;computer security	DB	-38.39482401293055	62.865419615909424	191569
c06083df2ae7020c25f299dc7f7e737b382de2a6	secure collaborative outsourced k-nearest neighbor classification with multiple owners in cloud environment		With the advent of big data era, it’s becoming an increasing trend for different clients lack of computational resources to cooperate in outsourcing data mining tasks to cloud service providers in order to produce maximum value of the joint database. Generally, the outsourced data contributed by clients should be encrypted under different keys owing to security concerns. Unfortunately, existing privacy-preserving outsourcing protocols are either restricted to a single key setting or quite inefficient due to frequent server-client interactions, making the deployment far from practical. In this paper, we focus on outsourced k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classification over encrypted data under multiple keys, and propose a set of secure building blocks and the Secure Collaborative Outsourced kNN (SCOkNN) protocol. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed protocol protects the confidentiality of data from data owners, privacy of query, and access patterns in the semi-honest model with negligible computation and communication costs. Experimental evaluation also demonstrates its practicability and efficiency.

Practical solutions will support local autonomy requirements of participating domains by allowing local policies to vary but imposing restrictions to ensure overall coherence of the system. This paper describes the design of a such a system to control access to experiments on the ABone active network testbed. This is done through a special-purpose language extending the Query Certi cate Manager (QCM) system to include protocols for secure mirroring. Our approach allows signi cant local autonomy while ensuring global security of the system by integrating veri cation with retrieval. This enables transparent support for a variety of certi cate distribution protocols.

324bd8936227c2c71f65898e70a89ce4996e160c	on the anonymization of differentially private location obfuscation		Obfuscation techniques in location-based services (LBSs) have been shown useful to hide the concrete locations of service users, whereas they do not necessarily provide the anonymity. We quantify the anonymity of the location data obfuscated by the planar Laplacian mechanism and that by the optimal geo-indistinguishable mechanism of Bordenabe et al. We empirically show that the latter provides stronger anonymity than the former in the sense that more users in the database satisfy k-anonymity. To formalize and analyze such approximate anonymity we introduce the notion of asymptotic anonymity. Then we show that the location data obfuscated by the optimal geo-indistinguishable mechanism can be anonymized by removing a smaller number of users from the database. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the optimal geo-indistinguishable mechanism has better utility both for users and for data analysts.	approximation algorithm;data anonymization;geo (microformat);information flow (information theory);location-based service;obfuscation (software)	Yusuke Kawamoto;Takao Murakami	2018	CoRR		theoretical computer science;probability distribution;differential privacy;anonymity;euclidean distance;obfuscation;computer science;laplace operator	Security	-38.96888946660122	63.31387828122314	194622

It focuses on privacy preserving on an individual level, when true individual values, e.g., values of attributes describing customers, are not revealed. Only distorted values and parameters of the distortion procedure are public. However, a miner can discover hidden knowledge, e.g., association rules, from the distorted data. In order to find frequent sets for quantitative association rules mining with preserved privacy, not only does a miner need to discretise continuous attributes, transform them into binary attributes, but also, after both discretisation and binarisation, the calculation of the distortion parameters for new attributes is necessary. Then a miner can apply either MASK (Mining Associations with Secrecy Konstraints) or MMASK (Modified MASK) to find candidates for frequent sets and estimate their supports. In this paper the methodology for calculating distortion parameters of newly created attributes after both discretisation and binarisation of attributes for quantitative association rules mining has been proposed. The new application of MMASK for finding frequent sets in discovering quantitative association rules with preserved privacy has been also presented. The application of MMASK scheme for frequent sets mining in quantitative association rules discovery on real data sets has been experimentally verified. The results of the experiments show that both MASK and MMASK can be applied in frequent sets mining for quantitative association rules with preserved privacy, however, MMASK gives better results in this task.

23bf8b2aa8449e463cbfe79afcf8d019013507d8	scalable private blocking technique for privacy-preserving record linkage		Record linkage is the process of matching records from multiple databases that refer to the same entities and it has become an increasingly important subject in many application areas, including business, government, and health. When we collect data which is about people from these areas, integrating such data across organizations can raise privacy concerns. To prevent privacy breaches, ideally records should be linked in a private way such that no information other than the matching result is leaked in the process, this technique is called privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL). Scalability is one of the main challenges in PPRL, therefore, many private blocking techniques have been developed for PPRL. They are aimed at reducing the number of record pairs to be compared in the matching process by removing obvious non-matching pairs without compromising privacy. However, they vary widely in their ability to balance competing goals of accuracy, efficiency and security. In this paper, we propose a novel private blocking approach for PPRL based on dynamic k-anonymous blocking and Paillier cryptosystem. In dynamic k-anonymous blocking, our approach dynamically generates blocks satisfying k-anonymity and more accurate values to represent the blocks with varying k. We also propose a novel similarity measure method which performs on the numerical attributes and combines with Paillier cryptosystem to measure the similarity of two blocks in security, which provides strong privacy guarantees that none information reveals. Experiments conducted on a public dataset of voter registration records validate that our approach is scalable to large databases and keeps a high quality of blocking. We compare our method with other techniques and demonstrate the increases in security and accuracy.	linkage (software)	Shumin Han;Derong Shen;Tiezheng Nie;Yue Kou;Ge Yu	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-45817-5_16	theoretical computer science;data mining	Security	-39.77719551012798	64.16551276456241	195713
add6acc167ebfa56214c568ef6ca28550309b341	cloud information retrieval: model description and scheme design		The fast development of cloud technology has brought about a new trend in the field of information service: more and more information is being transferred to the cloud as requested. However, the data, such as texts, images, sounds, and videos, before being moved to the cloud, in most cases, has to be encrypted so that intelligible information will not be obtained from unauthorized accesses. While having done a nice work in protecting the data privacy of its owners, this encrypting process, has produced a great challenge for retrieval of the document stored via traditional IR model based on document, query and relevance. In order to retrieve encrypted information from cloud, an alternative retrieval system is needed. To satisfy such a need, we have: 1) build a cloud information retrieval framework characterized by its retrieval risk formula, which, enables, for the very first time to the best of our knowledge, an effective retrieval of keywords from encrypted cloud data without undermining key word privacy and retrieval performance; and 2) upgraded the existing searchable encryption scheme that can only support simple equality queries on encrypted data and has been proved to perform slightly better than random selection, so that it can now support the state-of-art information retrieval methods, such as vector space, probabilistic, and language model. To evaluate the effect of the system proposed above, we’ve conducted a wide range of experiments on benchmark data sets, of which the results shows that solution can fulfill its purposes quite well in various settings.	authorization;benchmark (computing);cloud computing;encryption;experiment;information privacy;information retrieval;language model;relevance	Zhen Yang;Jiliang Tang;Huan Liu	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2797131	query expansion;language model;information retrieval;computer science;cloud computing;keyword extraction;encryption;probabilistic logic;information privacy;data set	Web+IR	-40.043845472099406	66.9643510095794	195836

As far as we know, the DR is the first approach supporting fine grained privacy measurement down to attribute’s values. Increased with the semantic dimension, the resulting semantic DR (SeDR) enables to: (1) tackle anonymity measurements from the attacker’s perspective, (2) prove that tcloseness can give lower privacy protection than l-diversity.	centrality;data anonymization;de-anonymization;emergence;information theory;privacy	Louis Philippe Sondeck;Maryline Laurent-Maknavicius;Vincent Frey	2017		10.5220/0006418002850294	information retrieval;t-closeness;data mining;computer science	Web+IR	-39.934903223847925	62.66717562689657	197678

However, providers of such services are not trusted to properly execute queries, so clients must be given assurance that the results are trustworthy. Therefore, authentication of database queries is needed to ensure correctness and completeness of the results provided by the cloud provider. One type of spatial query that is prominent in practice is the spatial skyline query (SSQ), which allows clients to retrieve results according to specific preferences. In this paper, we propose a solution for authenticating spatial skyline queries that focuses on reducing communication cost compared to existing solutions (MR-Trees). By using a flexible partitioning of the domain coupled with an efficient heuristic, we obtain communication costs that are up to three times lower than existing state-of-the-art.	authentication;cloud computing;computation;correctness (computer science);database;emergence;heuristic (computer science);location-based service;outsourcing;overhead (computing);pareto efficiency;social network;spatial query	Hans Lo;Gabriel Ghinita	2013		10.1145/2435349.2435374	computer science;database;internet privacy;world wide web;spatial query	DB	-40.793466574488214	60.452407969586545	199794
