This paper presents a solution to this problem, whereby spatial properties of a three-dimensional 'model' held in the Computer Generated Image system database are utilized in order to minimize hidden surface computations for producing moving perspective scenes. This solution is particularly acceptable to situations involving a fixed model and moving eye point. Often Computer Generated Image systems resort to processing individual surfaces from objects in the model to obtain display priority levels; the solution presented is based upon the use of preprocessed relative priority levels which only require complete objects to be given priority levels thus reducing real-time computation. Once an absolute display priority level for an object is found it will be shown that all surfaces forming that object have known display priority levels. Techniques used to obtain object display priority levels are discussed, together with background information concerning the hidden surface problem.	common gateway interface;hidden surface determination	D.

While motion capture technology creates realistic and believable motion for adult characters, the same type of data is hard to collect for young children.

We implemented a warping based style translation algorithm, and show the results when this algorithm is applied to adult to child transformation.	algorithm;image warping;motion capture	Yuzhu Dong;Aishat Aloba;Lisa Anthony;Eakta Jain	2018		10.2312/egp.20181023		HCI	-39.54371436652803	-36.00438725061705	175515

Although a large set of applications is now available bridging the gap between desktop and mobile devices, visualization of complex 3D models is still a task hard to accomplish without specialized hardware. This paper proposes a system where a cluster of PCs, equipped with accelerated graphics cards managed by the Chromium software, is able to handle remote visualization sessions based on MPEG video streaming involving complex 3D models. The proposed framework allows mobile devices such as smart phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and tablet PCs to visualize objects consisting of millions of textured polygons and voxels at a frame rate of 30 fps or more depending on hardware resources at the server side and on multimedia capabilities at the client side. The server is able to concurrently manage multiple clients computing a video stream for each one; resolution and quality of each stream is tailored according to screen resolution and bandwidth of the client.

Part of this process is the simulation of structural and functional properties, which is in many cases based on Finite Element Analysis (FEA). One prominent example from the automotive industry is the safety improvement resulting from crash worthiness simulations. A simulation model for this purpose usually consists of up to one million finite elements and is assembled from many parts which are individually meshed out of their CAD representation. In order to accelerate the development cycle, simulation engineers want to be able to modify their FE models without going back to the CAD department. Furthermore, valid CAD models might even not be available in preliminary design stages. However, in contrast to CAD, there is a lack of tools that offer the possibility of modification and processing of finite element components while maintaining the properties relevant to the simulation. In this application paper we present interactive algorithms for intuitive and fast editing of FE models and appropriate visualization techniques to support engineers in understanding these models. This includes new kinds of manipulators, feedback mechanisms and facilities for virtual reality and immersion at the workplace, e.g. autostereoscopic displays and haptic devices.	algorithm;autostereoscopy;computer-aided design;experiment;finite element method;haptic technology;immersion (virtual reality);mock object;new product development;simulation;virtual reality	Dirc Rose;Katrin Bidmon;Thomas Ertl	2004	IEEE Visualization 2004	10.1109/VISUAL.2004.58	simulation;computer science;finite element method;virtual reality;data visualization;statistics	Visualization	-37.0984781167067	-31.604538320931784	178077
1cb9c30edfa4743029d2a18b692f5ac85a5b7a3f	analyzing interfaces and workflows for light field editing		With the increasing number of available consumer light field cameras, such as Lytro, Raytrix, or Pelican Imaging, this new form of photography is progressively becoming more common. However, there are still very few tools for light field editing, and the interfaces to create those edits remain largely unexplored. Given the extended dimensionality of light field data, it is not clear what the most intuitive interfaces and optimal workflows are, in contrast with well-studied two-dimensional (2-D) image manipulation software. In this work, we provide a detailed description of subjectsâ€™ performance and preferences for a number of simple editing tasks, which form the basis for more complex operations. We perform a detailed state sequence analysis and hidden Markov chain analysis based on the sequence of tools and interaction paradigms users employ while editing light fields. These insights can aid researchers and designers in creating new light field editing tools and interfaces, thus helping to close the gap between 4-D and 2-D image editing.	light field	Marta OrtÃ­n-ObÃ³n;Adrian Jarabo;BelÃ©n MasiÃ¡;Diego Gutierrez	2017		10.1145/3102163.3102190	humanâ€“computer interaction;sequence analysis;curse of dimensionality;software;signal processing;workflow;image editing;computer science;light field	HCI	-33.7575772619087	-33.81723664547111	178094

In this paper, we present a novel automatic camera control technique providing a scene analysis framework based on information theory. The developed framework contains a probabilistic model of the scene to build entropy and expectancy maps. These maps are utilized to find interest points which represent either characteristic behaviors of the crowd or novel events occurring in the scene. After an interest point is chosen, the camera is updated accordingly to display this point. We tested our model in a crowd simulation environment and it performed successfully. Our method can be integrated into existent camera control modules in computer games, crowd simulations and movie pre-visualization applications.	crowd simulation;image resolution;information theory;map;pc game;previsualization;statistical model;user experience;virtual reality	Cagatay Turkay;Emre Koc;Selim Balcisoy	2009	The Visual Computer	10.1007/s00371-009-0337-1	smart camera;statistical model;computer vision;camera auto-calibration;simulation;information theory;computer science;virtual machine;crowd simulation;mathematics;multimedia;statistics	Vision	-37.108108482189266	-37.773535351688245	178357

A hierarchically structured and constraintbased data model is developed to support product design from features to parts and further to assemblies in a VR environment. Product design in the VR environment is performed in an intuitive manner through precise constraint-based manipulations. Constraint-based manipulations are accompanied with automatic constraint recognition and precise constraint satisfaction to establish constraints between objects, and are further realized by allowable motions for precise 3D interactions in the VR environment. The allowable motions are represented as a mathematical matrix and derived from constraints between objects by constraint solving. A procedure-based degrees-of-freedom combination approach is presented for 3D constraint solving. A rule-based constraint recognition engine is developed for both constraint-based manipulations and implicitly incorporating constraints into the VR environment. An intuitive method is presented for recognizing pairs of mating features between assembly components. Examples are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.	constraint satisfaction problem;data model;interaction;logic programming;virtual reality	Yongmin Zhong;Xiaobu Yuan;Weiyin Ma;Bijan Shirinzadeh	2009	Intelligent Automation & Soft Computing	10.1080/10798587.2009.10643022	constraint logic programming;concurrent constraint logic programming;constraint programming;binary constraint;simulation;constraint satisfaction;constraint learning;computer science;artificial intelligence;constraint satisfaction dual problem;virtual reality;constraint;product design;constraint satisfaction problem;local consistency;backtracking	AI	-38.64530721488844	-33.15078497980999	178532

Such avatars are not in wide use because solutions for creating them from high-end scanners, low-cost range cameras, and tailoring measurements all have limitations. Here we propose a simple solution and show that it is surprisingly accurate. We use crowdsourcing to generate attribute ratings of 3D body shapes corresponding to standard linguistic descriptions of 3D shape. We then learn a linear function relating these ratings to 3D human shape parameters. Given an image of a new body, we again turn to the crowd for ratings of the body shape. The collection of linguistic ratings of a photograph provides remarkably strong constraints on the metric 3D shape. We call the process crowdshaping and show that our Body Talk system produces shapes that are perceptually indistinguishable from bodies created from high-resolution scans and that the metric accuracy is sufficient for many tasks. This makes body """"scanning"""" practical without a scanner, opening up new applications including database search, visualization, and extracting avatars from books."""	3d printing;avatar (computing);book;crowdsourcing;image resolution;linear function;linear model;virtual reality	Stephan Streuber;Maria Alejandra Quiros-Ramirez;Matthew Q.

This paper presents a semantic model for representing the complex environment, where the semantic information is described with a three-tier framework: a geometric level, a semantic level and an application level. Each level contains different maps for different purposes and our approach greatly facilitates the interactions between individuals and virtual environment. And then a modified continuum crowd method is designed to fit the proposed virtual environment model so that realistic behaviors of large dense crowds could be simulated in multilayered complex environments such as buildings and subway stations. Finally, we implement this method and test it in two complex synthetic urban spaces. The experiment results demonstrate that the semantic environment model can provide sufficient and accurate information for crowd simulation in multilayered complex environment.	apache continuum;crowd simulation;interaction;map;multitier architecture;synthetic intelligence;virtual reality	Hao Jiang;Wenbin Xu;Tianlu Mao;Chunpeng Li;Shihong Xia;Zhaoqi Wang	2009		10.1145/1643928.1643972	semantic data model;simulation;computer science;virtual machine;operating system;crowd simulation;multimedia	HPC	-37.369906433938695	-34.98536988722687	181344

This paper presents an expressive rendering approach for visualizing large-scale 3D city scenes with various rendering styles integrated in a seamless way. Each view is actually a combination of the photorealistic rendering and the nonphotorealistic rendering to highlight the information that is interesting for the users and de-emphasize the other that is less important. At run-time, the users are allowed to specify their interested locations interactively. Our system automatically computes the salience of each location and illustrates the entire scene with emphasis in the area of interests. The GPU-based implementation enables interactive realtime performance. Our implementation of a system demonstrates benefits in many applications such as 3D GPS navigation, tourist information, etc. We have performed a pilot user evaluation of the effect for users to access information in 3D city.	gps navigation device;graphics processing unit;interactivity;run time (program lifecycle phase);seamless3d;unbiased rendering	Bin Pan;Yong Sheng Zhao;Xiaoming Guo;Xiang Chen;Wei Chen;Qunsheng Peng	2012	The Visual Computer	10.1007/s00371-012-0773-1	computer vision;tiled rendering;rendering;parallel rendering;multimedia;real-time rendering;software rendering;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-33.795884321952165	-35.139447537300626	182347

The characters' heads and faces posed unique problems that were difficult to solve with our existing technology. From tiny pinched mouths, to ear to ear smiles, their expressions stretched to great extremes without disturbing the clean profiles and smooth shading of their round heads. A new approach was developed to preserve and control the head shapes while allowing facial features to slide freely around those curved volumes. Additionally, Schulz removed 3 dimensional form where it diluted clarity and drew aspects of the character differently when it detracted from simple graphic appeal. Thus, their proportions and facial features change position and shape depending on their viewing angle. Due to the degree of change, a single standard three dimensional model would not suffice. To solve this issue we decided to make rig states which we called character views.	3d modeling;shading;simplified molecular-input line-entry system;viewing angle	Adam Burr;Steve Gressak;Matthew Doble;Christian Haniszewski;Ignacio Barrios;Brian Anderson;Ferris Webby	2015		10.1145/2775280.2792563	computer vision;artificial intelligence;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	-39.97089010175557	-35.56546952874719	182680

Especially due to the popular YouTube annotations framework, integrating graphical annotations in a video has become very fashionable these days. However, the current options are limited to a few graphical shapes for which the user can define as good as no dynamic behaviour. Despite the enormous demand for easy-creatable, interactive video there are no such advanced tools available. In this article we describe an innovative approach, to realize dynamics and interactivity of video annotations. First we explain basic concepts of video-markup like the generic element model and visual descriptors. After that we introduce the event-tree model, which can be used to define event-handling in an interactive video formally as well as visually. By combining these basic concepts, we can give an effective tool to the video community for realizing interactive and dynamic video in a simple, intuitive and focused way.	event (computing);event tree;extensibility;graphical user interface;interactivity;markup language;requirement;usability;virtual community;visual descriptor	Peter Schultes;Franz Lehner;Harald Kosch	2011	J.

We design computational features derived from line segments to describe drawing styles, enabling style classification such as discriminating mangas targeting youth boys and youth girls, and discriminating artworks produced by different artists. With statistical analysis, we found that drawing styles can be effectively characterized by the proposed features such that explicit (e.g., density of line segments) or implicit (e.g., included angles between lines) observations can be made to facilitate various manga style classification.	computation	Wei-Ta Chu;Ying-Chieh Chao	2014		10.1145/2647868.2654962	multimedia;statistics	HCI	-36.59142388619334	-36.162812546114644	183105

In this paper, a special simulation-based and lifestyle-oriented CAD system is introduced to help the user in engineering design of thermal quality clothing. The engineering-oriented simulation models endowed with explicit data availability arose from the material parameters that are the key issue for engineering application. To offer an easy-to-use tool, this system is implemented with a lifestyle-oriented design procedure. It can facilitate the designers to quickly implement design and simulate on the wearing scenario, and evaluate and optimize their design. Due to the design of thermal quality clothing can be achieved without making physical prototypes, it is able to speed up the design cycle and reduce the design and development cost.	caddie;computer animation;computer-aided design;engineering design process;logic synthesis;simulation;virtual reality	Aihua Mao;Jie Luo;Yi Li;Ruomei Wang;Guiqing Li;Yueping Guo	2011	Engineering with Computers	10.1007/s00366-011-0224-z	simulation;systems engineering;engineering;engineering drawing	EDA	-37.09201786520244	-31.61300999858306	183489
50f8dfc437e22a70c78e72821f3332f0f822befa	a framework for recognition and animation of chess moves printed on a chess book		The work presented in this paper proposes a set of techniques to animate chess moves which are printed on a chess book. Those techniques include (1) extraction of chess moves from an image of printed page, (2) recognition of chess moves from the extracted image, and (3) displaying digitally encoded successive moves as an animation on a chessboard. Since all the moves are temporally related, temporal animations show change of spatial patterns in time. Moreover, it becomes easier to understand how the moves are played out and who leads the game. In this study, we animate chess moves printed in Figurine Algebraic Notation (FAN) notation. The proposed technique also eliminates false recognition by means of controlling possible moves in accordance with the rules of chess semantics.	algorithm;book;denotational semantics;image analysis;printing;robot;robotic arm;shape analysis (digital geometry)	SÃ¼leyman Eken;AbdÃ¼lkadir Karabas;Hayrunnisa Sari;Ahmet Sayar	2018	Int.

Concept design refers to the clh irlitio design of a product or part. In concept design. the product details such as shape features and exact dimensions are not rigidly defined and the designer has some freedom in determining the shape and dimensions of the product. Current U\D require the designer to specify shape and dimensions to create (â€˜AI) models of products even though these are probably not necessary at the concept development stage. (OVIRDS overcomes these drawbacks by providing a bi-modal voice and hand-tracking based user interface to the VR-based CAlI modeling environment. This interface allows rapid concept design creation without requiring time consuming shape description and the tedious specifications of exact dimensions.

Conversely, video editing is still challenging and mainly left to the professionals. Even basic video manipulations involve complicated software tools that are typically not adopted by the amateur user. In this paper we propose a system that allows an amateur user to performs a basic matchmove by adding an inlay to a video. Our system does not require any previous experience and relies on a simple user interaction. We allow adding 3D objects and volumetric textures to virtually any video.

Simulators enable NC programmers and machine operators to detect visually potential collisions and gross programming errors. A machining verifier seeks to determine automatically, without recourse to human judgement, whether an NC program will produce a specified part without undesirable side effects (collisions, cutter breakage, etc.). Simulators and verifiers both require solid modelling facilities, but simulators need only fast display generators for Boolean combinations whereas verifiers require more varied and powerful facilities. This paper summarizes the issues underlying simulation and verification while describing a new simulator that is being converted into a verifier.		Ugur A. Sungurtekin;Herbert B.

The presented approach is unique in that it works with monocular and binocular data, respects the depth of focus, can handle moving objects and is ready to be used for selective rendering.	3d modeling;binocular vision;graphics processing unit;heat map;new product development;online and offline;real-time clock	Thies Pfeiffer;Cem Memili	2015	2015 IEEE Virtual Reality (VR)	10.1109/VR.2015.7223393	computer vision;shading;visualization;computer science;multimedia;solid modeling;data visualization;computer graphics (images);mechanical engineering	Visualization	-37.99842099519904	-35.07037821185739	185896

The system takes as input player motion trajectory data tracked from game video and supported by knowledge of hockey strategy, game situation and specific player profiles. The raw motion trajectory data consists of space-time point sequences of player position registered to rink coordinates. The raw data is augmented with knowledge of forward/backward skating, possession of the puck and specific player attributes (e.g., shoots left, shoots right). We use a finite state machine (FSM) model to represent our total knowledge of given situations and develop evaluation functions for primitive hockey behaviours (e.g., pass, shot). Based on the augmented trajectory data, the FSMs and the evaluation functions, we describe what happened in each identified situation, assess the outcome, estimate when and where key play choices were made, and attempt to predict whether better alternatives were available to achieve understood goals. A textual natural language description and a simple ID graphic animation of the analysis are produced as the output. The design is flexible to allow the substitution of different analysis modules and extensible to allow the inclusion of additional hockey situations.	evaluation function;finite-state machine;natural language	Fahong Li;Robert J.

An underlying, reactive level generator ensures that all levels created in the environment are playable, and provides the ability for a human designer to rapidly view many different levels that meet their specifications. The human designer can iteratively refine the level by placing and moving level geometry, as well as through directly manipulating the pacing of the level. This paper presents the design environment, its underlying architecture that integrates reactive planning and numerical constraint solving, and an evaluation of Tanagra's expressive range.	constraint satisfaction problem;level design;numerical analysis;procedural generation;reactive planning;tanagra	Gillian Smith;E.

Since animation concerns pictures changing over time, we consider the manipulation of movies or picture sequences. A compact set of primitive operations over movies is introduced and its use as the basis for an animation system is illustrated. The notion of the behaviour of an animated character is formalised and we show how simple behaviours may be combined to create more complex behaviours. We then show how higher-order functions allow us to construct a variety of useful tools which lead to a highly concise functional script.	functional approach;functional programming;higher-order function;image	Kavi Arya	1986	Comput.

The Internet and the WWW have been widely used for delivering, processing, and publishing 3D data. There is increasingly demand for more and easier access to 3D content on the web. The better the browser experience, the more potential revenue that web-based content can generate for providers and others. The main focus of this thesis is on the design, develop and implementation of a new 3D generic modelling method based on Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for web-based applications. While the model is initialized using classical 3D graphics, the scene model is extended using SVG. A new algorithm to present 3D graphics with SVG is proposed. This includes the definition of a 3D scene in the framework, integration of 3D objects, cameras, transformations, light models and textures in a 3D scene, and the rendering of 3D objects on the web page, allowing the end-user to interactively manipulate objects on the web page. A new 3D graphics library for 3D geometric transformation and projection in the SVG GL is design and develop.#R##N##R##N#A set of primitives in the SVG GL, including triangle, sphere, cylinder, cone, etc. are designed and developed. A set of complex 3D models in the SVG GL, including extrusion, revolution, Bezier surface, and point clouds are designed and developed. The new Gouraud shading algorithm and new Phong Shading algorithm in the SVG GL are proposed, designed and developed. The algorithms can be used to generate smooth shading and create highlight for 3D models. The new texture mapping algorithms for the SVG GL oriented toward web-based 3D modelling applications are proposed, designed and developed. Texture mapping algorithms for different 3D objects such as triangle, plane, sphere, cylinder, cone, etc. will also be proposed, designed and developed. This constitutes a unique and significant contribution to the disciplines of web-based 3D modelling, as well as to the process of 3D model popularization.	graphical user interface;scalable vector graphics;web application	Jisheng Lu	2015			web modeling;web mapping;computer science;theoretical computer science;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-40.59102112496068	-33.50639127224191	192051

Our system first sites the important regions of a city, such as the commercial center, historical center, and residential areas. Then, a network of freeway and main roads are built. Finally, a network of streets are built throughout the city. The main contribution described in this paper is the design of the freeways, main streets and minor streets, and the allocation of space for the roads and buildings in the city. Compared to existing methods, our system creates cities that more closely mimics real-world cities, and can also generate millions of streets in seconds.	algorithm;freeway	Soon Tee Teoh	2008			procedural modeling;simulation;drill;lock (computer science);rotation;3d computer graphics;axial symmetry;coupling;mechanical engineering;computer science	AI	-36.93842857194508	-32.52989755429151	192755

An illustrution is a picture that is designed to fulfill a communicative intent such as showing the location of an object or showing how an object is manipulated. An illustration is generated by implementing a set of stylistic decisions, ranging from determining the way in which an individual object is lit, to deciding the general composition of the illustration. The design of an illustration is treated as a goal-driven process within a system of constraints. The goal is to achieve communicative intent; the constraints are the illustrative techniques an illustrator can apply.We have developed IBIS (Intent-Based Illustration System), a system that puts these ideas into practice. IBIS designs illustrations using a generate-and-test approach, relying upon a rule-based system of methods and evaluators. Methods are rules that specify how to accomplish visual effects, while evaluators are rules that specify how to determine how well a visual effect is accomplished in an illustration. Examples of illustrations designed by IBIS are included.	adobe illustrator;constraint (mathematics);rule-based system;visual effects	DorÃ©e D. Seligmann;Steven K.

We enable a simple and meaningful interaction for object-centric navigation and manipulation of long shot videos by introducing operators on three high-level video semantics: background mosaics, object motions, and camera motions. We estimate the scene background and represent the object motion using 3-D space-time trajectories. We use the 3-D object trajectories as basic interaction elements, and define several object and camera operations as simple and intuitive curve manipulations. These allow users to perform various video object temporal manipulations by interactively manipulating the object trajectories. The camera operations model the camera as a movable and scalable aperture and allow the users to simulate pan, tilt, and zoom effects by creating new camera trajectories. With several example compositions, we demonstrate that our representation and operations allow users to simply and interactively perform numerous seemingly complex, high-level video manipulation tasks.	computer vision;high- and low-level;humanâ€“computer interaction;interactive media;panâ€“tiltâ€“zoom camera;scalability;scene graph;simulation;timeline;usability;user interface;video processing	Rajvi Shah;P.

We will start by a brief classification of augmented reality. This paper then describes the principle of our mixed reality system in teleoperation. It tackles the problem of scene registration using a manmachine cooperative and multisensory vision system. The system provides the operator with powerful sensorial feedback as well as appropriate tools to build (and update automatically) the geometric model of the perceived scene. We describe a new interactive approach combining image analysis and mixed reality techniques for assisted 3D geometric and semantic modeling.

Repetitive or regular movements, however, require non-trivial programming effort and/or integration with a pathing system. We here describe an example-based approach to path generation that requires little or no additional programming effort. Our work modifies the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm, adapting it to produce pathing plans similar to an input sketch. We show how simple sketch modifications control path characteristics, and demonstrate feasibility through a usable Unity implementation.	algorithm;heuristic (computer science);map;obstacle avoidance;pixel;uniform resource identifier;unity;variable shadowing;video post-processing;wave function collapse	Hugo Scurti;Clark Verbrugge	2018			artificial intelligence;machine learning;usable;sketch;computer science	NLP	-37.17660577442684	-36.979160487691054	194546

One application of this teaching tool is radiographic positioning instruction. We propose Augmented Reality, a technology that allows the overlay of graphically generated objects(bones in this case) on the real scenes(body in this case), as a means of visualization for such an application. In this paper we describe the design and the three stages of development of a prototype unit which demonstrates elbow movement. Preliminary results and problems encountered while developing the first stage, are also presented.	virtual reality	Anantha R. Kancherla;Jannick P. Rolland;Donna L. Wright;Grigore C.

It is part of an exposition on the Cultural Heritage of the Egyptian Mummies in the Museum Gustavianum, in Uppsala. We describe a general-purpose projection metaphor for correctly presenting virtual 3D images on the dissection table of a historical anatomic theatre. This method allows for dynamic offaxis perspective viewing situations as well as it provides keystone correction for excessive projection angles as necessitated by the specific installation environment. For the application to reach out beyond the scope of the exhibition, we developed an adaptive image-based rendering approach that scales with the performance of the rendering host. Based on dynamic mesh simplification of the 3D mummy model, it automatically performs re-projections of texture images in order to maintain correct visual results. For interaction purposes with a digitiser tablet we present a means of stroke-based input that provides ease of use to non-expert visitors of the exhibition.		Stefan Seipel;M.

Specifically, we address the role of multiple shape representations with varying uncertainty levels during 3D conceptual sketching, along with methods to transform between those representations. The main contributions of this work are: (1) the formulation of virtual shape data in multiple, concurrent representations (points and surfaces), and a regressionmethod to transition fluidly back and forth between these representations during design, (2) methods for deforming and exploring the product shape using these multiple representations, and (3) representations of these forms such that designers can explore conceptual designs without the need for detailed surface operations such as trimming or continuity enforcement. Through incorporating these contributions, we introduce techniques that can be incorporated in future computer-aided conceptual design systems. These contributions are demonstrated for freeform surface design, with examples of computer mouse and car seat exterior surfaces. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Many authors have emphasized the importance of the effects of realistic illumination for computer generated images, and this applies especially to the context of 3D city visualization. However, current 3D city visualization applications rarely implement techniques for achieving realistic illumination, in particular the effects caused by current weather-related phenomena. At most, some geospatial visualization systems render artificial skiesâ€”sometimes with a georeferenced determination of the sun positionâ€”to give the user the impression of a real sky. However, such artificial renderings are not sufficient for real simulation purposes. In this paper we present techniques to augment visualizations of digital 3D city models with real-time display of georeferenced meteorological phenomena. For this purpose we retrieve weather information from different sources, i. e., real-time images from cameras and radar data from web-based weather services, and we use this information in the rendering process for realistic visualization of different weather-related issues, such as clouds, rain, fog, etc. Our approach is not limited to a specific setup, and we have evaluated the results in a user study presented in this paper.	3d city models;digital 3d;illumination (image);real-time locating system;simulation;usability testing;web application	Frank Steinicke;JÃ¶rg Mensmann;Klaus H.

The key issue is, as always in real-time interactions, to identify the key factors that should get computational resources for ensuring the best user interaction efficiency. For this reason we first recall the definition and scope of such essential terms as immersion and presence, while clarifying the confusion existing in the fields of Virtual Reality and Games. This is done in conjunction with a short literature survey relating our interaction efficiency goal to key inspirations and findings from the field of Action Neuroscience. We then briefly describe our full-body real-time postural control with proactive local collision avoidance. The concept of obstacle spherification is introduced both to reduce local minima and to decrease the user cognitive task while interacting in complex environments. Finally we stress the interest of the egocentric environment scaling so that the user egocentric space matches the one of a height-differing controlled avatar.	computational resource;entity;image scaling;immersion (virtual reality);interaction;maxima and minima;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;self-similarity;spatialâ€“temporal reasoning;virtual reality	Ronan Boulic;Damien Maupu;Manuel Peinado;Daniel Raunhardt	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16958-8_7	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;spatial contextual awareness;maxima and minima;inverse kinematics;consciousness;virtual reality;multimedia;immersion;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	-38.65904709182006	-37.217017259194634	196701
7647490937dc47eec0ba61535dad37b895e4cc7b	the effect of translational ego-motion on the perception of high fidelity animations	simulation;virtual reality;global illumination;motion simulators	The quality of the graphics displayed in motion simulators can play a signficant role in improving a user's training experience in such devices. However, the computation of high-fidelity graphics using traditional rendering approaches takes a substantial amount of time, precluding their use in such an interactive environment. This paper investigates exploiting how the human visual system deals with motion, to drive a selective rendering system. Such a selective renderer computes perceptually important parts of a scene in high quality and the remainder of the scene at a lower quality, and thus at a much reduced computational cost, without the user being aware of this quality difference. In this study we concentrate on translational motion and show, even for this less dramatic form of motion, a viewer's perception of a scene can be significantly effected.  A study was conducted involving 120 subjects in 8 conditions. An additional 'button-press' study of 26 subjects was also carried out. The results show that, for both studies, viewers could not notice a decrease in rendering quality when subjected to motion.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;display resolution;graphics;motion simulator;rendering (computer graphics);simulation	G.

This is performed by extending the standard notion of distance Level of Detail (LOD) into three dimensions to give volumetric LOD; whereby the LOD of an object is related to its presence within a three-dimensional volume which is aligned with the user's gaze. Before introducing this technique, some background details are discussed regarding the relevant characteristics of the human visual system and current solutions for effective gaze tracking. Subsequently, a brief cross-section of relevant research is presented and a conceptual model of volumetric LOD is formulated. Finally, implementation factors for such a system are considered and a theoretical evaluation is proffered.	eye tracking;graphics;level of detail;real-time transcription;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality	Martin Reddy	1995	Virtual Reality	10.1007/BF02009713	three-dimensional space;computer vision;computer science;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-36.00123542421234	-35.73383951260078	197063

We have developed a prototype image recognition system capable of identifying landmark (typically, city buildings and structures) from photographs captured on camera phones. The image recognition process runs server-side, as a Web service accessible over GPRS from a Web enabled phone or PDA. Photographs of landmarks are preloaded into a central database, which is then queried by users submitting images from their camera phones. The image recognition algorithm is robust to variations in both illumination and point of view. In this paper, the effective method was suggested for the transmission of the geographic information acquired by camera attached to a PDA such as position data, altitude data, and image data in the wireless Internet environment in real-time.	algorithm;camera phone;charge-coupled device;computer vision;effective method;global positioning system;location-based service;mobile mapping;personal digital assistant;prototype;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;server (computing);server-side;web service	Jin-Suk Kang;Yonghee You;Mee Young Sung	2007	2007 2nd International Conference on Digital Information Management	10.1109/ICDIM.2007.4444270	web service;computer vision;digital mapping;computer science;multimedia;law;world wide web;computer security	Robotics	-34.01223600127138	-36.14197882447632	197380

To support this specification, the development system must be able to interpret the examples and cast their underlying rules into an internal representation language. This language must find a suitable trade-off among a number of contrasting requirements regarding expressiveness, automatic executability, and suitability to the automatic representation of rules deriving from the analysis of examples. A language is presented which attains this trade-off by combining together an operational and a declarative fragment to separately represent the autonomous execution of each individual agent and its interaction with the environment, respectively. While the declarative part permits to capture interaction rules emerging from specification examples, the operational part supports the automatic execution in the operation of the virtual environment. A system is presented which embeds this language within a visual shell to support a behavioral training in which the animation rules of virtual agents are defined through visual examples.	specification by example	Alberto Del Bimbo;Enrico Vicario	1995	IEEE Trans.

The motion of such virtual humans should look realistic (or â€˜naturalâ€™) and allow interaction with the surroundings and other (virtual) humans. Current animation techniques differ in the trade-off they offer between motion naturalness and the control that can be exerted over the motion. We show mechanisms to parametrize, combine (on different body parts) and concatenate motions generated by different animation techniques. We discuss several aspects of motion naturalness and show how it can be evaluated. We conclude by showing the promise of combinations of different animation paradigms to enhance both naturalness and control.		Herwin van Welbergen;Ben J.

Thus, we foresee the emergence of language-based 3D scene generation systems to let ordinary users quickly create 3D scenes without having to learn special software, acquire artistic skills, or even touch a desktop window-oriented interface. WordsEye is such a system for automatically converting text into representative 3D scenes. WordsEye relies on a large database of 3D models and poses to depict entities and actions. Every 3D model can have associated shape displacements, spatial tags, and functional properties to be used in the depiction process. We describe the linguistic analysis and depiction techniques used by WordsEye along with some general strategies by which more abstract concepts are made depictable.	3d modeling;desktop computer;emergence;entity;natural language	Robert Coyne;Richard Sproat	2001		10.1145/383259.383316	natural language processing;computer vision;computer science;multimedia;natural language;programming language;information technology;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	-39.08228814092103	-32.593272316782986	199043

Using commercially available video, compression and network equipment and the display quadrant technique, distributed workgroups can now collaborate on tera-scale problem sets. They can take full advantage of high-resolution displays with real-time interactivity. In addition, the system cost and network usage scales linearly for larger resolution displays and/or the addition of new remote sites.		Jerrold A. Friesen;Thomas D.

aa4e7e70306e8a2910cb3fe59702a7e36a4d064d	marker hiding methods: applications in augmented reality	a general works	In augmented reality, the markers are noticeable by their simple design of a rectangular image with black and white areas that disturb the reality of the overall view. As the markerless techniques are not usually robust enough, hiding the markers has a valuable usage, which many researchers have focused on. Categorizing the marker hiding methods is the main motivation of this study, which explains each of them in detail and discusses the advantages and shortcomings of each. The main ideas, enhancements, and future works of the well-known techniques are also comprehensively summarized and analyzed in depth. The main goal of this study is to provide researchers who are interested in markerless or hiding-marker methods an easier approach for choosing the method that is best suited to their aims. This work reviews the different methods that hide the augmented reality marker by using information from its surrounding area. These methods have considerable differences in their smooth continuation of the textures that hide the marker area as well as their performance to hide the augmented reality marker in real time. It is also hoped that our analysis helps researchers find solutions to the drawbacks of each method.	augmented reality	Rania Mousa;Mohd Shahrizal Sunar;Hoshang Kolivand;Amjad Rehman;Abdullah Al-Dhelaan;Mznah Al-Rodhaan	2015	Applied Artificial Intelligence	10.1080/08839514.2015.993553	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-36.681224221512345	-35.888282363276865	199335

VIPR is an attempt to bring the traditional strengths of textual imperative languages to a visual programming language. It leverages these strengths to make use of well understood design and abstraction methodologies while providing additional visual features, such as explicit representations, contextual information, and execution animation. VIPR uses these strengths and features to address the quasi-real-time problem posed by the VPC, whose requirements include interaction with the low-level vehicle manipulation code, map exploration and display, as well as additional requirements such as flexibility of solution and performance demands. Our solution does not directly address pedagogical issues or the value of VIPRâ€™s simple graphical semantics. It did point out weaknesses with VIPRâ€™s approach to solving the scalability problem in visual programming languages. âˆ—This work was supported in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation: NSF CISE-IRI-9616242.	abstraction layer;debugging;diagram;distortion;extensibility;graphical user interface;handy board;high- and low-level;ibm notes;imperative programming;map projection;programmer;real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;scalability;tcl;top-down and bottom-up design;virtual private cloud;visual language;visual programming language	Wayne Citrin;Soraya Ghiasi;Benjamin G.

(To this end, we have been analysing constructions commonly found in NL instructions, in terms of their representational requirements [3]. However here our point of discussion is NL Generation. Wha t makes us such eager consumers of advances and technology in this area is tha t animated simulations without narrat ion (ultimately, spoken narration) is only half the story. As researchers studying plan inference have shown [2], it may be well-nigh impossible to infer an agent 's intentions simply by observing his or her actions alone. 2 And we know that the ability to perform an action effectively in a range of environments requires understanding its intention, not just the physical motions used in some performance. Thus, communicating intentions is as impor tant to effective task instruction as demonstrat ing physical skills. Sharing the burden of communication between Natural Language and graphics, as Feiner and McKeown have noted [4], takes advantage of the best of both possible worlds. While some parts of our system are further along than others, no work at all has yet been done on generation. However, we have tried to take account of the needs of generation in designing the system, so that we will not have painted ourselves in a hole from the start . We clearly and hope to get further ideas and direction from this meeting. Basically, the sys tem has been designed so that the generator will receive information from three sources (see Figure 1.):	graphics;nl (complexity);natural language;nick mckeown;possible world;requirement;simulation	Norman I.

Especially, when the image generation takes too much time the users want to see the progress in the rendering process. The user may decide either to continue the rendering process or stop the rendering according to the current view of the image. This may be due to the fact that either the image is produced to enough detail for the user or the user does not want to continue the rendering process for some reason. This is especially important for progressive transmission of images over the Internet. The images may be progressively transmitted and when the detail level of the image is enough for the user, the transmission process may stop. In this paper, we survey the progressive image generation techniques and present an algorithm for progressive generation of raytraced images. The algorithm utilizes a refinement technique that is similar to the one used in generating interlaced images in a progressive manner.	algorithm;glossary of computer graphics;interlaced video;internet;ray tracing (graphics);refinement (computing);rendering (computer graphics)	Okan Arikan;Ugur GÃ¼dÃ¼kbay	2000		10.1007/3-540-40888-6_23	ray tracing;computer vision;rendering;computer science;multimedia;real-time rendering;user interface;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	-34.69698245349044	-35.13436544139315	199563
