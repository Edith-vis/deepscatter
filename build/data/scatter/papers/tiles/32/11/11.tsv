46c5e01a4f9f437896f9ea0b9aa624340769f9c4	barista: an implementation framework for enabling new tools, interaction techniques and views in code editors	computer program;programming environments;programming environment;user interface;programming environments end user software engineering;abstract syntax tree;end user software engineering;visual representation;structured editors;interaction technique	Recent advances in programming environments have focused on improving programmer productivity by utilizing the inherent structure in computer programs. However, because these environments represent code as plain text, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to embed interactive tools, annotations, and alternative views in the code itself. Barista is an implementation framework that enables the creation of such user interfaces by simplifying the implementation of editors that represent code internally as an abstract syntax tree and maintain a corresponding, fully structured visual representation on-screen. Barista also provides designers of editors with a standard text-editing interaction technique that closely mimics that of conventional text editors, overcoming a central usability issue of previous structured code editors.	abstract syntax tree;computer program;feedback;ibm notes;interaction technique;interactivity;nichols plot;parse tree;programmer;programming productivity;source code editor;structured programming;text editor;usability;user interface	Andrew Jensen Ko;Brad A.

2c2d0a8188b56a5e79a90562671ef277d34fc31d	an interactive fashion design system 'infads'		Abstract   This paper describes an application of a color graphic display system ‘INFADS’ to a fashion design process using man-machine conversation. One of the main characteristics of the system is the interactive design facility created by combining a color picture processing system with a data base system. Another important characteristic is the introduction of a new recursive concept of ‘picture’ and ‘texture’. Some advantages of describing fashion data in a relational data base are discussed in connection with the need for data independence and the need for the semantic retrieval of pictorial data via a data description scheme.

Knowledge about the framework design, code and domain complements the cases. The case retrieval, adaptation and learning mechanisms developed distinguish our work from others in the framework reuse literature. An authoring tool that helps in the implementation of the approach is sketched. A prototype tool that helps in the reuse of a framework in the graphical user interface domain illustrates the approach.		Mercedes Gómez-Albarrán;Pedro A.

01ba58fe5be3af5c1e8704556f2d1ab25d4d48e8	the representation and use of a visual lexicon for automated graphics generation	selection model;building block	Most automated graphics generation systems employ either a constructive or a parametric graphics synthesis approach. Constructive graphics synthesis is a deductive approach that builds visual presentations from scratch by gluing together the most basic visual variables. Conversely, parametric graphics synthesis defines a set of parametrized visual models and interprets the information to be presented through instantiation of the selected model. To increase efficiency, we have combined parametric and constructive approaches in a system called IMPROVISE. In this paper, we focus on the parametric aspect of our approach. We present a comprehensive, general, and extensible formalism to represent a visual lexicon for use in automated graphics generation. A visual lexicon is a collection of parametrized primitive visual objects that serve as building blocks for constructing more complex visual presentations. We also illustrate how this representation can be effectively employed to aid the selection and instantiation of a visual lexical item in the graphics generation process. Examples are given from IMPROVISE to demonstrate the representation and use of this visual lexicon.	graphics;lexicon;semantics (computer science);universal instantiation;visual objects	Michelle X.

c789d621addc0a9028ad569d09ef93ba6a0cc8aa	vanishing windows—a technique for adaptive window management	screen clutter;window manager;vanishing windows;cognitive overload;adaptive window manager	Windowing system offer many benefits to users, such as being able to work on multiple tasks concurrently; or working with a number of windows, each connected to different remote machines or applications. Unless these windows are managed efficiently, users can easily become overwhelmed by the number of windows currently open and begin to lose their way round the desktop. This can lead to a state where the desktop is cluttered with windows. At this stage ‘‘window thrashing ’’ occurs, as users begin to perform window management operation (move, resize, minimise and etc.) in order to locate relevant pieces of information contained in one of several open windows. This article identifies a number of problems experienced by users of any windowing system such as Microsoft Windows, X-Windows or the Apple Macintosh windowing systems. It outlines a technique for reducing screen clutter when using such systems. The technique is known as Vanishing or Fading Windows . One of the features of this technique is that some of the burden of the window management operation is taken over by the system, hence allowing the user to focus more on application domain activities. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

It can also be used as an interface to Computer Algebra Systems (CASs). In the present work, interfaces to three general-purpose CASs have been implemented. GNU T E Xmacs [1] is a free (GPL) word processor which • typesets texts and mathematical formulae with very high quality (like L A T E X), • emphasizes the logical structure of a document rather than its appearance (like L A T E X), • is easy to use and intuitive (like typical wysiwyg word processors), • can be extended by a powerful programming language (like Emacs), • can include PostScript figures (as well as other figures which can be converted to PostScript), • supports a number of languages based on Latin and Cyrillic alphabets. It uses T E X fonts both on screen and when printing documents. Therefore, it is truly wysiwyg, with equally good quality of on-screen and printed documents (in contrast to LyX which uses X fonts on screen and calls L A T E X for printing). There is a similar commercial program called Scientific Workplace (for Windows). T E Xmacs can also be used as an interface to any CAS which can generate L A T E X output. It renders L A T E X formulae on the fly, producing CAS output with highest 1	central processing unit;display resolution;gnu;general-purpose modeling;maxima;microsoft windows;mupad;on the fly;postscript;printing;programming language;reduce;rendering (computer graphics);scientific workplace;wysiwyg;emacs	A.

This article presents two such games in which multiple threads of control are represented by multiple avatars that can perform actions concurrently in a game environment. The player controls the avatars by specifying a sequence of actions for each avatar to execute using a block-based visual syntax, independent of programming language. The avatars execute their actions in the game environment, showing the effect of every action.	avatar (computing);concurrency (computer science);programmer;programming language;thread (computing)	Cornelia P.

Adaptive hypermedia tries to alleviate these problems by ensuring that the links that are offered and the content of the information pages are adapted to each individual user. This is done by maintaining a user model. Most adaptive hypermedia systems are aimed at one specific application. They provide an engine for maintaining the user model and for adapting content and link structure. They use a fixed screen layout that may include windows (HTML frames) for an annotated table of contents, an overview of known or missing knowledge, etc. Such systems are typically closed and difficult to reuse for very different applications. We present AHA, an open Adaptive Hypermedia Architecture that is suitable for many different applications. This paper concentrates on the adaptive hypermedia engine, which maintains the user model and which filters content pages and link structures accordingly.

We explain how genre contributes to mental picturing of interactive applications and participates to improve their acceptability. We propose some genre centred guidelines for interactive applications design which derive from verbal interactions. We define a set of steps in design process, a graphical notation which helps specification of interaction scenarios, and some genre centred evaluation criterions. Then, we introduce an experimental development process of two interactive applications carried out according to our approach. Finally, we evaluate the produced applications utility, usability and acceptability, and the design resources provided to development teams.	linear algebra	Marion Latapy-Etcheverry;Philippe Lopistéguy;Pantxika Dagorret	2007	Ingénierie des Systèmes d'Information	10.3166/isi.12.6.119-145	design;simulation;design process;usability;computer science;artificial intelligence;evaluation;user interface;information system	Crypto	-37.43999036399899	-26.631856388290707	183199

They blend navigation and browsing capabilities, common features of hypermedia, with “classical” operations (or transactions), common features of traditional information systems. This new coupling, between hypermedia and operational features, raises a number of novel design issues. In this paper, we focus upon conceptual modeling for web applications, trying to identify its scope and its main issues. We claim that conceptual modeling for web applications is not just the union of two activities performed in isolation: modeling the operations and modeling the hypermedia. Rather, the integration of the two facets of design (hypermedia and operations) is the issue. The coexistence of operational and navigational aspects poses, among others, the following new problems to designers: How do information structures and navigation support operations? How do operations affect information structures and navigation? How do operations and navigation interfere? How are user tasks related to both navigation and operations? The above issues, together with other relevant ones, are discussed in the paper, providing a contribution toward possible solutions, based upon the overall framework W2000.	coexist (image);data structure;distributed computing;e-commerce payment system;hypermedia;information system;online and offline;www;web application	Luciano Baresi;Franca Garzotto;Paolo Paolini	2000		10.1007/3-540-45394-6_9	web modeling;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;conceptual model;operating system;web navigation;database;distributed computing;multimedia;information technology;world wide web;computer security;information system	Web+IR	-38.661376098006045	-24.82579579947105	184070

4cd5c55c6f51a18784f5fe18f057cbea344dc0e9	an mpeg-dash methodology for qoe-aware web3d streaming		Recent advances in web technologies have now created a ubiquitous environment for cross-platform and cross-device multimedia applications. Media files can now be reproduced in a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers and web-enabled televisions, using a common infrastructure. This trend towards unifying the technological infrastructure, however, has given rise to a new array of problems resulting from the varying technological capabilities of the different devices and environments. This paper, proposes an adaptive streaming framework for the display of 3D models on a wide range of web-enabled devices. The open, XML-based X3D language for 3D graphics is combined with the MPEG-DASH standard for adaptive streaming. The end result is a framework that can adaptively display 3D graphics in the face of network or computational limitations, and dynamically adapt data flow to maximize user Quality of Experience in any situation.

Human factors research now stands along side of cognitive modeling and artificial intelligence as promising new ventures into enhanced user-computer performance. Some notions developed in the cognitive modeling and artificial intelligence communities are presented, along with three techniques that we believe hold promise for enhanced user-system interaction. The techniques include 1) graphic equivalence, 2) graphic explanations, and 3) embedded process modeling. Graphic equivalence refers to the use of split or dual screen hardware configurations that permit users to interact with graphic and alphanumeric screens and create equivalence on the other. Graphic explanations are those that permit users to see graphically the analytical components of system-and user-generated problem solutions, while embedded process modeling refers to a technique designed to help users know where they have been in the problem-solving process, where they are going in the process, and what the whole process looks like. The domain for testing the techniques is Army tactical planning at the Corps level.	artificial intelligence;cognitive model;computer performance;embedded system;human factors and ergonomics;problem solving;process modeling;research now;turing completeness;user-generated content	Stephen J.

Interactive document preparation systems commonly have incorporated simple representations—an unconstrained linear list of document objects in the ‘What You See Is What You Get’ (WYSIWYG) systems. Recent research projects have been directed at the interactive manipulation of richer tree-oriented representations in which object relationships are constrained through grammatical specification. The advantage of such representations is the increased flexibility that they provide in the reusability of the document and its components and the more powerful user commands that they permit. We report on the experience gained from the design of two such systems. Although the two systems were designed independently of each other, a common set of issues, representations, and techniques has been identified. An important component of these projects has been to examine the WYSIWYG user interface, retaining the naturalness of their user interface but eliminating their dependencies on the physical-page representation. Aspects of the design of such systems remain open for further research. We describe these open research problems and indicate some of the further gains that may be achievable through investigation of these document representations.	interactivity;open research;printing;user interface;wysiwyg	Richard Furuta;Vincent Quint;Jacques André	1988	Electronic Publishing		well-formed document;user interface design;computer science;user requirements document;database;multimedia;programming language;user interface;world wide web;information retrieval;multiple document interface;design document listing	HCI	-39.80726670862222	-29.126793717329548	187401

Visual programming by example allows designers to define animation rules by “training” agents, thereby building behavioral rules into specification models that run automatically during the execution of the virtual environment. This allows for direct and effective replication of real-life phenomena and agent reactions to environmental stimuli. uman-computer interaction has evolved from textual programming toward visual languages with 3D direct manipulation interfaces. In this evolution, the cognitive effort necessary for users to manage system objects has been progressively reduced by augmenting their engagement in the operation. Virtual reality environments are the ultimate stage in this trend.’ VR environments represent directly the world of interest. Complex interfaces engage users’ 3D perceptual and spatial skills, which are largely underemployed in conventional interfaces, to accomplish a direct and natural interaction. Virtual agents that change their state in response to external and internal stimuli enhance the sense of a real-life environment. The user can interact with the system without referring to syntactic and semantic conventions of an intermediary interaction language, relyng instead on empirical knowledge of the emulated environment. VR applications in fields such as personnel training, entertainment, hostile-environment exploration, and physical therapy may profit from such augmented yet simplified interaction.	direct manipulation interface;emulator;human–computer interaction;intelligent agent;programming by example;real life;virtual reality;visual programming language	Alberto Del Bimbo;Enrico Vicario	1996	IEEE MultiMedia	10.1109/93.486703	computer vision;programming;virtual image;color image;human–computer interaction;temporal logic;image processing;computer science;virtual machine;graphics;artificial intelligence;operating system;virtual reality;computer animation;multimedia;visual programming language;user interface;specification;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-35.60349472084733	-27.24140135759255	190575

Sensors worn with the watch track location (via GPS), acceleration, and speech activity; this is classified and conveyed to the other party, where it appears in iconic form on the watch face. When a remote person with whom this information is shared examines it, their face appears on the watch of the person being checked on. The working prototype was used as the focus of interviews to gauge the desirability of such a device. WatchMe is a watch-based personal communicator that draws upon features of both mobile telephony and context-aware ubiquitous computing and integrates them in a user interface that is novel to both these domains. WatchMe extracts information from sensors to provide awareness and availability information to one's closest friends. It supports multiple modes of verbal communication (text messaging, voice messaging, and synchronous voice communication) enabling the recipients of the awareness information to choose the best communication modality. Photographs serve as emotional references to our loved ones, appearing on the watch when one of them is thinking of us.	context awareness;global positioning system;instant messaging;modality (human–computer interaction);personal communicator;prototype;sensor;ubiquitous computing;user interface;watch	Natalia Marmasse;Chris Schmandt;David Spectre	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30119-6_13	speech recognition;internationalization and localization;global positioning system;human–computer interaction;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;computer security;ubiquitous computing;voice	HCI	-35.78155300787267	-25.345934147307336	190775

In order to attenuate this negative effect, we introduce the concept of Progressive Access which aims at giving WIS users a flexible and personalized access to data. First, information considered as essential regarding the user's needs is provided, and then, additional information, if needed, becomes gradually available. Progressive access requires to stratify the information space. These stratifications are described through a central model called the Progressive Access Model (PAM). We present here the PAM and its connections to four other models (data model, functional model, hypermedia model, user model).We show how these five models are linked and exploited during the design of the WIS. Instantiating these models leads to the generation of WIS which integrate the progressive access approach.	information system	Marlène Villanova-Oliver;Jérôme Gensel;Hervé Martin	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-45242-3_22	data modeling;stratification;the internet;simulation;user modeling;hypertext;data model;computer science;function model;artificial intelligence;database;multimedia;information management;world wide web;information system	HCI	-38.723557661664096	-25.593823687210428	190861

Our aim is to support effective orientation in increasing amount of information accessible through the Web. We present a method for personalized navigation based on social navigation where the information space is represented by an ontology. Navigational information is obtained by following user footsteps. It is attached to information fragment mapped to the user goal and to description of this goal using an ontology. This information is used later to show the way to similar goals. We use ontology representation of the information space that supports the effective navigation and the navigational ability to deal with frequent changes of information content in open environments. We demonstrate the proposed method in the context of developed software tool PENA for personalized navigation support in labor supply domain.	application domain;color;ontology (information science);personalization;programming tool;self-information;semantic web;world wide web	Mária Bieliková;Katarína Matusíková	2007	Computing and Informatics		turn-by-turn navigation;computer science;data mining;world wide web;mobile robot navigation;information retrieval	AI	-39.89105117748602	-25.027633707656417	190904

Likewise, enabling seamless and intuitive interaction is a process fraught with difficulty. Embedding intelligence into the mobile application or the physical environment as articulated by the AmI vision is one potential strategy that software engineers could adopt.

We are particularly interested in supporting decision tradeoff, where preferences are revised in response to the available outcomes. In several user-involved decision aid systems we designed in the past, we were able to observe three generic tradeoff strategies that people like to use. We show how a preference model based on soft constraints is well-suited for supporting these strategies. Such a framework provides an agile preference model particularly powerful for preference revision during tradeoff analysis. We further show how to integrate the constraint-based preference model with an interaction model called example-critiquing. We report on user studies which show that this model offers significant advantages over the commonly used ranked-list model, especially when the decision problem becomes complex.	agile software development;algorithm;computation;constrained optimization;constraint programming;constraint satisfaction problem;decision problem;decision support system;decision theory;experiment;preference elicitation;preference learning;programming paradigm;robustness (computer science);semantics (computer science);smartclient;solver;usability testing;user (computing);utility	Pearl Pu;Boi Faltings	2004	Constraints	10.1023/B:CONS.0000049205.05581.24	constraint programming;decision field theory;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;decision problem;mathematics;configuration;algorithm	AI	-36.661509949978765	-27.721896637085024	192839

However, developing adaptive systems is not an easy task. In developing discourse-based adaptive systems, one difficulty is that the expertise required to write the discourse operators is complex. In this paper, we present a graphical authoring tool, Constructor, that supports document designers in defining the texts to be generated. Constructor allows people knowledgeable about the application domain to author discourse operators. We also hope that it affords a more intuitive visual way to define documents as compared to the currently laborious encoding of discourse operators. We expect that modifying and creating new document specifications becomes an easier task with Constructor. To test our approach and gain understanding of how to support further the authoring process, we have started user studies. We briefly describe here our initial experiment.	adaptive hypermedia;prototype	Shijian Lu;Cécile Paris	2007	IJLT	10.1504/IJLT.2007.015451	computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;adaptive system;multimedia;world wide web	HPC	-37.725660024292814	-28.863823111161057	195258

M. C. Escher, a Dutch artist, created many interesting tiling artworks of this class using animal-shaped tiles such as lizards, fishes, and birds. Our system is intended to help human users create such Escher-like tiling patterns. The basic idea is to place points according to some subgroup of a congruent transformation group on the plane, and to consider a collection of Voronoi regions as tiles. In this system, users supply an initial set of points. The system generates copies via a subgroup of the congruent transformation group, and constructs the Voronoi diagram for these points. The Voronoi regions belonging to the copied set of points are merged and the resulting region is considered as a tile. This results in a tiling pattern that covers the plane with a single tile shape. Users can generate their own tile shapes by editing the initial set of points. The performance of the system is demonstrated by example.	artworks;escher;interactivity;tessellation (computer graphics);tiling window manager;voronoi diagram	Kokichi Sugihara	2010	2010 International Symposium on Voronoi Diagrams in Science and Engineering	10.1109/ISVD.2010.23	combinatorics;mathematics;geometry;engineering drawing	Arch	-36.239560620948296	-30.34303336306171	197297

dd1269d021fb9cc34537c6b22871584a91224db9	architectures for ubiquitous 3d on heterogeneous computing platforms		Today, a wide scope for 3D graphics applications exists, including domains such as scientific visualization, 3D-enabled web pages, and entertainment. At the same time, the devices and platforms that run and display the applications are more heterogeneous than ever. Display environments range from mobile devices to desktop systems and ultimately to distributed displays that facilitate collaborative interaction. While the capability of the client devices may vary considerably, the visualization experiences running on them should be consistent. The field of application should dictate how and on what devices users access the application, not the technical requirements to realize the 3D output. The goal of this thesis is to examine the diverse challenges involved in providing consistent and scalable visualization experiences to heterogeneous computing platforms and display setups. While we could not address the myriad of possible use cases, we developed a comprehensive set of rendering architectures in the major domains of scientific and medical visualization, webbased 3D applications, and movie virtual production. To provide the required service quality, performance, and scalability for different client devices and displays, our architectures focus on the efficient utilization and combination of the available client, server, and network resources. We present innovative solutions that incorporate methods for hybrid and distributed rendering as well as means to manage data sets and stream rendering results. We establish the browser as a promising platform for accessible and portable visualization services. We collaborated with experts from the medical field and the movie industry to evaluate the usability of our technology in real-world scenarios. The presented architectures achieve a wide coverage of display and rendering setups and at the same time share major components and concepts. Thus, they build a strong foundation for a unified system that supports a variety of use cases.
