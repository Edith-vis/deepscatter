9053b45f1c8f697d0a902c2c3576a54327e6db9a	white-box implementation of stream cipher		White-box cryptography is a software obfuscation technique for cryptography implementation. It can protect the secret key even if an attacker has full access and control over the cryptosystem implementation and its execution platform. There have been several proposals for a white-box implementation of cryptography. We propose a white-box implementation of a stream cipher that can achieve the same asymptotic performance as the standard implementation. Our black-box implementation of KCipher-2 achieves low storage consumption of no more than 2 megabytes and is suitable for a PC, tablet, and smartphone. On the other hand, we can achieve space hard implementation to protect against a code-lifting attack. Furthermore, the implementation can protect against black-box attacks and a BGE attack.	black box;cryptography;cryptosystem;key (cryptography);lambda lifting;megabyte;obfuscation (software);performance evaluation;smartphone;stream cipher;tablet computer;white box (software engineering)	Kazuhide Fukushima;Seira Hidano;Shinsaku Kiyomoto	2017		10.5220/0006115202630269	rail fence cipher;block cipher;triple des;two-square cipher;block cipher mode of operation;fluhrer, mantin and shamir attack;stream cipher attack;stream cipher;cbc-mac	Security	-40.69033867802015	70.25846892607605	176456

Next, we go over a wide range of different strategies and techniques, along with their respective empirical implementations. Starting with approaches that attempted to provide privacy on Bitcoin/existing blockchain systems, then going into more advanced techniques, such as secure multi-party computations, ring signatures, and zero knowledge proofs, that construct a more advanced blockchain system from scratch with the objective of preserving privacy. Finally, we conclude that the current state of privacy on blockchains still needs work for it to be reliable. Nevertheless, the field of privacy in this domain is developing and advancing at a rapid rate.	antivirus software;bitcoin;computation;privacy;zero-knowledge proof	Jad Wahab	2018	CoRR		theoretical computer science;ring signature;implementation;scratch;computation;computer science;blockchain;zero-knowledge proof	Security	-38.53829605750802	72.09059005836612	177197
d00276f948740e4e6b982faba0cfb80d92807927	a first glimpse of cryptography's holy grail	holy grail	WE aLL KnoW how to protect our private or most valuable data from unauthorized access: encrypt it. When a piece of data M is encrypted under a key K to yield a ciphertext C=EncK(M), only the intended recipient (who knows the corresponding secret decryption key S) will be able to invert the encryption function and recover the original plaintext using the decryption algorithm DecS(C)=DecS(EncK(M))=M. Encryption today—in both symmetric (where S=K) and public key versions (where S remains secret even when K is made publicly available)—is widely used to achieve confidentiality in many important and well-known applications: online banking, electronic shopping, and virtual private networks are just a few of the most common applications using encryption, typically as part of a larger protocol, like the TLS protocol used to secure communication over the Internet. Still, the use of encryption to protect valuable or sensitive data can be very limiting and inflexible. Once the data M is encrypted, the corresponding ciphertext C behaves to a large extent as a black box: all we can do with the box is keep it closed or opened in order to access and operate on the data. In many situations this may be exactly what we want. For example, take a remote storage system, where we want to store a large collection of documents or data files. We store the data in encrypted form, and when we want to access a specific piece of data, we retrieve the corresponding ciphertext, decrypting it locally on our own trusted computer. But as soon as we go beyond the simple data storage/ retrieval model, we are in trouble. Say we want the remote system to provide a more complex functionality, like a database system capable of indexing and searching our data, or answering complex relational or semistructured queries. Using standard encryption technology we are immediately faced with a dilemma: either we store our data unencrypted and reveal our precious or sensitive data to the storage/ database service provider, or we encrypt it and make it impossible for the provider to operate on it. If data is encrypted, then answering even a simple counting query (for example, the number of records or files that contain a certain keyword) would typically require downloading and decrypting the entire database content. Homomorphic encryption is a special kind of encryption that allows operating on ciphertexts without decrypting them; in fact, without even knowing the decryption key. For example, given ciphertexts C=EncK(M) and C'=EncK(M'), an additively homomorphic encryption scheme would allow to combine C and C' to obtain EncK(M+M'). Such encryption schemes are immensely useful in the design of complex cryptographic protocols. For example, an electronic voting scheme may collect encrypted votes Ci=EncK(Mi) where each vote Mi is either 0 or 1, and then tally them to obtain the encryption of the outcome C=EncK(M1+..+Mn). This would be decrypted by an appropriate authority that has the decryption key and ability to announce the result, but the entire collection and tallying process would operate on encrypted data without the use of the secret key. (Of course, this is an oversimplified protocol, as many other issues must be addressed in a real election scheme, but it well illustrates the potential usefulness of homomorphic encryption.) To date, all known homomorphic encryption schemes supported essentially only one basic operation, for example, addition. But the potential of fully homomorphic encryption (that is, homomorphic encryption supporting arbitrarily complex computations on ciphertexts) is clear. Think of encrypting your queries before you send them to your favorite search engine, and receive the encryption of the result without the search engine even knowing what the query was. Imagine running your most computationally intensive programs on your large datasets on a cluster of remote computers, as in a cloud computing environment, while keeping both your programs, data, and results encrypted and confidential. The idea of fully homomorphic encryption schemes was first proposed by Rivest, Adleman, and Dertouzos the late 1970s, but remained a mirage for three decades, the never-to-be-found Holy Grail of cryptography. At least until 2008, when Craig Gentry announced a new approach to the construction of fully homomorphic cryptosystems. In the following paper, Gentry describes his innovative method for constructing fully homomorphic encryption schemes, the first credible solution to this long-standing major problem in cryptography and theoretical computer science at large. While much work is still to be done before fully homomorphic encryption can be used in practice, Gentry’s work is clearly a landmark achievement. Before Gentry’s discovery many members of the cryptography research community thought fully homomorphic encryption was impossible to achieve. Now, most cryptographers (me among them) are convinced the Holy Grail exists. In fact, there must be several of them, more or less efficient ones, all out there waiting to be discovered. Gentry gives a very accessible and enjoyable description of his general method to achieve fully homomorphic encryption as well as a possible instantiation of his framework recently proposed by van Dijik, Gentry, Halevi, and Vaikuntanathan. He has taken great care to explain his technically complex results, some of which have their roots in lattice-based cryptography, using a metaphorical tale of a jeweler and her quest to keep her precious materials safe, while at the same time allowing her employees to work on them. Gentry’s homomorphic encryption work is truly worth a read.	algorithm;authorization;black box;ciphertext;cloud computing;computation;computer data storage;confidentiality;cryptographic protocol;cryptosystem;database;download;homomorphic encryption;lattice-based cryptography;list of cryptographers;online banking;out there;plaintext;public-key cryptography;secure communication;theoretical computer science;thinking outside the box;transport layer security;universal instantiation;virtual private network;web search engine	Daniele Micciancio	2010	Commun.

In this paper, we revise this formalism into a flexible specification framework for complex crypto-protocols. More specifically, we equip it with an extensible typing infrastructure based on dependent types with subsorting, which elegantly captures and enforces basic relations among objects, such as between a public key and its inverse. We also introduce the notion of memory predicate, where principals can store information that survives role termination. These predicates allow specifying complex protocols structured into a coordinated collection of subprotocols. Moreover, they permit describing different attacker models using the same syntax as any other role. We demonstrate this possibility and the precision of our type system by presenting two formalizations of the Dolev-Yao intruder. We discuss two execution models for this revised version of MSR, one sequential and one parallel, and prove that the latter can be simulated by the former.	dependent type;dolev–yao model;microsoft research;public-key cryptography;rewriting;semantics (computer science);type system;yao graph	Iliano Cervesato	2000	Electr.

e28d519798309ef2fd3ad5ae693b4090b2f8592c	optimizing sha256 in bitcoin mining		Bitcoin is a “crypto currency”, a decentralized electronic payment scheme based on cryptography. It implements a particular type of peer-to-peer payment system. Bitcoin depends on well-known cryptographic standards such as SHA-256. In this paper we revisit the cryptographic process which allows one to make money by producing new bitcoins. We reformulate this problem as a specific sort of Constrained Input Small Output (CISO) hashing problem and reduce the problem to a pure block cipher problem, cf. Fig. 1. We estimate the speed of this process and we show that the amortized cost of this process is less than it seems and it depends on a certain cryptographic constant which is estimated to be at most 1.89. These optimizations enable bitcoin miners to save countless millions of dollars per year in electricity bills.	bitcoin;optimizing compiler;sha-2	Nicolas Courtois;Marek Grajek;Rahul Naik	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-44893-9_12	data mining	ML	-38.91987960455845	70.17775460085386	178730

We investigate the relationship between simulatability in synchrono us and asynchronous frameworks by means of the formal models of Pfitzmann et al., which are sem inal in using this concept in order to bridge the gap between the formal-methods and the cryptographic community. We show that the synchronous model can be seen as a special cas e of the asynchronous one with respect to simulatability, i.e., we present an embe dding from the synchronous model into the asynchronous one that we show to preserve simu latability. We show that this result allows for carrying over lemmas and theorems tha t rely on simulatability from the asynchronous model to its synchronous counterpart with out any additional work, hence future work on enhancing simulatability-based models can c oncentrate on the more general asynchronous case.	cryptography;formal methods	Michael Backes	2003	J.

Current security ver- ification tools are well suited for analyzing protocols in iso- lation and it is not clear how they can be used for protocols intended to be run in more“dynamic”settings. Think of pro- tocol procedures sharing parameters, arbitrarily interleaved or used as building blocks in more complex compound proce- dures. SPIN is a well established general purpose verification tool that has good support for modeling such systems. In contrast to specialized tools, SPIN lacks support for crypto- graphic primitives and intruder model which are necessary for checking security properties. We consider a special class of security protocols that fit well in the SPIN framework. Our modeling method is systematic, generic and efficient enough so that SPIN could find all the expected attacks on several of the classical key distribution protocols.	cryptographic protocol;key distribution;spin	Noomene Ben Henda	2014		10.1145/2632362.2632378	computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer security	Security	-35.60548223424181	73.04038406442434	179309

However, for many applications it is sufficient to achieve detectable broadcast. With this primitive, broadcast is only guaranteed when all players are non-faulty (""""honest""""), but all non-faulty players always reach agreement on whether broadcast was achieved or not. We show that detectable broadcast can be achieved regardless of the number of faulty players (i.e., for all t < n). We give a protocol which is unconditionally secure, as well as two more efficient protocols which are secure with respect to computational assumptions, and the existence of quantum channels, respectively.These protocols allow for secure multi-party computation tolerating any t < n, assuming only pairwise authenticated channels. Moreover, they allow for the setup of public-key infrastructures that are consistent among all participants --- using neither a trusted party nor broadcast channels.Finally, we show that it is not even necessary for players to begin the protocol at the same time step. We give a """"detectable Firing Squad"""" protocol which can be initiated by a single user at any time and such that either all honest players end up with synchronized clocks, or all honest players abort."""	authentication;byzantine fault tolerance;computational hardness assumption;public-key cryptography;quantum channel;secure channel;secure multi-party computation;semantic security;synchronization (computer science)	Matthias Fitzi;Daniel Gottesman;Martin Hirt;Thomas Holenstein;Adam D.

Modular inversion is one of the most basic computations in algorithmic number theory. When it comes to cryptosystems, this computation is very time-consuming since the modulus is generally a large number. It is unrealistic for some devices with limited computation capability (e.g. mobile devices and IC cards) to conduct such a time-consuming computation. In this paper, we investigate how to securely outsource the inversion modulo a large composite number. Based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), we design a secure outsourcing algorithm for inversion modulo a large composite number with two known prime factors for the client. Besides the privacy of the number and its modular inversion, our algorithm also protects the privacy of the modulus. We can verify the correctness of the result with probability 1. Traditionally, the complexity of modular inversion for a l-bit modulus is O(l3). By leveraging the cloud, our algorithm reduces the complexity to O(l2) on the client side. Also, we prove the security of our algorithm based on the one-malicious version of two untrusted program model (one-malicious model). We conduct several experiments to demonstrate the validity and the practicality of our proposed algorithm. In appendix, we show that our proposed algorithm can be extended and applied in the secret key generation of RSA algorithm on the resource-constrained devices.	modulo operation;outsourcing	Qianqian Su;Jia Yu;Chengliang Tian;Hanlin Zhang;Rong Hao	2017	Journal of Systems and Software	10.1016/j.jss.2017.04.015	theoretical computer science;correctness;computer science;chinese remainder theorem;cryptosystem;computation;key generation;computational number theory;composite number;modulo	Crypto	-40.05192689031747	70.49548045149412	181229

Anonymous membership broadcast schemes have several applications, such as anonymous delegation, cheating prevention, etc. In a w-anonymous membership broadcast scheme any coalition of at most w users, which does not include the user chosen by the dealer, has no information about the identity of the chosen user. Wang and Pieprzyk proposed a combinatorial approach to 1-anonymous membership broadcast schemes. In particular, they proposed a 1-anonymous membership broadcast scheme offering a logarithmic complexity for both communication and storage. However, their result is non-constructive. In this paper, we consider w-anonymous membership broadcast schemes. First, we propose a formal model to describe such schemes and show lower bounds on the communication and randomness complexities of the schemes. Afterwards, we show that w-anonymous membership broadcast schemes can be constructed starting from ðwþ 1Þ-wise independent families of permutations. The communication and storage complexities of our schemes are logarithmic in the number of users.	broadcast domain;formal language;randomness extractor;upwind scheme	Alfredo De Santis;Barbara Masucci	2004	Des.

This requirement is undesirable in several applications. We propose a new construction of hash chains based on inserting a ‘breakpoint’ after fixed number of links in the chain. We also propose a method with which the current hash chain traversal techniques can be applied to our construction without any significant changes in the storage and computation requirements and with the added advantage that the intermediate links may be stored on a public and non-trusted storage. We are also able to prove the security of our construction by replacing the hash function with a MAC function.	analysis of algorithms;breakpoint;computation;hash chain;hash function;markov chain;micropayment;mobile device;non-volatile memory;password;requirement;tree traversal;volatile memory	Vipul Goyal	2004	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive			Crypto	-39.29397065096008	68.66048461313594	183882

Since biometric authentication systems transmit data other than the protected templates, we need to consider how to secure biometric authentication systems against adversaries with those data. In this paper, we propose a classification of adversaries in biometric authentication with template protection into the following three types in accordance with their knowledge: (1) protected template data, (2) data transmitted during authentication, and (3) both types of data. We also propose a new security metric unforgeability, which provides authentication security against attacks by adversaries impersonating someone else on authentication systems even when they cannot obtain the biometric information of a claimant. We then give security definitions against each type of adversary we classified. We also propose a biometric authentication scheme with template protection that is irreversible against all types of adversaries.	adversary (cryptography);authentication;biometrics	Toshiyuki Isshiki;Toshinori Araki;Kengo Mori;Satoshi Obana;Tetsushi Ohki;Shizuo Sakamoto	2013	2013 International Conference of the BIOSIG Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)		data authentication algorithm;ntlmssp;chip authentication program;challenge–response authentication;computer science;cryptography;access control;authentication protocol;generic bootstrapping architecture;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;multi-factor authentication;internet privacy;protected extensible authentication protocol;network access control;world wide web;computer security;email authentication;statistics	DB	-40.33898857609666	71.95564132067348	184630

In this paper, we propose three new and secure outsourcing schemes of matrix calculation by using one untrusted cloud server. The first one is for matrix multiplication, the second is for the inverse of a matrix, and the third is for the determinant of a matrix. Compared with other proposed schemes, our schemes are superior in efficiency owing to the reduction of user cost. In particular, the user's computation cost in our schemes is at most 1/4, 1/4, 7/16 of the corresponding schemes in the state-of-the-art algorithms, respectively. In addition, the efficiency and security of our schemes are analysed and proved.	formal verification;outsourcing	Can Xiang;Chunming Tang	2015	IJHPCN	10.1504/IJHPCN.2015.070009	cloud computing;computer science;cryptography;theoretical computer science;operating system;internet privacy;computer security	Crypto	-40.126992359093826	70.1844187850594	184682

5490219c078cbf43d1047b5f119db948219d9cb7	automated analysis of accountability		A recent trend in the construction of security protocols such as voting and certificate management systems is to make principals accountable for their actions. Whenever some principals deviate from the protocol’s prescription and cause the failure of a goal of the system, accountability ensures that the system can detect the misbehaving parties who caused that failure. Accountability is an intuitively stronger property than verifiability as the latter only rests on the possibility of detecting the failure of a goal. A plethora of accountability and verifiability definitions have been proposed in the literature. Those definitions are either very specific to the protocols in question, hence not applicable in other scenarios, or too general and widely applicable but requiring complicated and hard to follow manual proofs. In this paper, we advance formal definitions of verifiability and accountability that are amenable to automated verification. Our definitions are general enough to be applied to different classes of protocols and different automated security verification tools. Furthermore, we point out formally the relation between verifiability and accountability. We validate our definitions with the automatic verification of three protocols: a secure exam protocol, Google’s Certificate Transparency, and an improved version of Bingo Voting. We find through automated verification that all three protocols satisfy verifiability while only the first two protocols meet accountability.	bingo voting;certificate transparency;certificate authority;computational complexity theory;critical systems thinking;cryptography;essence;formal verification;proverif;proof assistant;random number generation;reachability;sensor	Alessandro Bruni;Rosario Giustolisi;Carsten Schürmann	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-69659-1_23	management science;accountability;business;mathematical proof;voting;cryptographic protocol;certificate management protocol;medical prescription	Security	-37.42507457997369	72.15843477334336	184888

If encryption and watermarking do commute, their combination can serve as an important building block within a Digital Rights Management (DRM) System, as detailed further in Section 2. In the present paper, an existing CWE concept for still images [1] is extended to audio files. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CWE scheme for audio files to appear in the literature. In addition, we show that the presented CWE scheme can be integrated into a modified version of a protocol due to Craver and Katzenbeisser [2], enabling zero-knowledge verification of the watermark, meaning a verifier can verify the presence of a watermark without disclosure of the mark M or the watermarking key WK.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we motivate the need for CWE schemes and identify some basic requirements. In Section 3, we shortly review existing CWE schemes for still images and encryption/watermarking techniques for audio files, with a special emphasis on those algorithms using similar techniques as in our approach. In Section 4, we present our CWE scheme in detail. Section 5 provides experimental results on the robustness and fidelity of the watermarking part. Section 6 presents the integration of the CWE scheme into a zero-knowledge protocol for verifying the mark, and Section 7 concludes the paper.	algorithm;common weakness enumeration;digital rights management;digital watermarking;embedded system;encryption;ibm spectrum protect (tivoli storage manager);key (cryptography);plaintext;requirement;verification and validation;wikipedia;zero-knowledge proof	Roland Schmitz;Jan Gruber	2017	Adv. in MM	10.1155/2017/5879257	theoretical computer science;algorithm	Crypto	-40.69074266560928	74.44238677904089	185233

By building on the geometric concepts of convexity and convex hull, NoN ensures a continuous progress of the negotiation, thus neutralising malicious or inefficient opponents. In particular, NoN allows an agent to derive in a finite number of steps, and independently of the behaviour of the opponent, that there is no hope to find an agreement. To be able to make such an inference, the interested agent may rely on herself only, still keeping the highest freedom in the choice of her strategy. We also propose an actual NoN-compliant strategy for an automated agent and evaluate the computational feasibility of the overall approach on both random negotiation scenarios and case studies of practical size.	bilateral filter;convex function;convex hull;malware;web crawler	Toni Mancini	2016	Fundam.

Informally, a probabilistic program is differentially private if the participation of a single individual in the input database has a limited effect on the program's distribution on outputs. More technically, differential privacy is a quantitative 2-safety property that bounds the distance between the output distributions of a probabilistic program on adjacent inputs. Like many 2-safety properties, differential privacy lies outside the scope of traditional verification techniques. Existing approaches to enforce privacy are based on intricate, non-conventional type systems, or customized relational logics. These approaches are difficult to implement and often cumbersome to use. We present an alternative approach that verifies differential privacy by standard, non-relational reasoning on non-probabilistic programs. Our approach transforms a probabilistic program into a non-probabilistic program which simulates two executions of the original program. We prove that if the target program is correct with respect to a Hoare specification, then the original probabilistic program is differentially private. We provide a variety of examples from the differential privacy literature to demonstrate the utility of our approach. Finally, we compare our approach with existing verification techniques for privacy.	assertion (software development);best, worst and average case;computation;differential privacy;existential quantification;hoare logic;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);non-interference (security);program transformation;randomized algorithm;soundness (interactive proof);type system;vertex cover	Gilles Barthe;Marco Gaboardi;Emilio Jesús Gallego Arias;Justin Hsu;César Kunz;Pierre-Yves Strub	2014	2014 IEEE 27th Computer Security Foundations Symposium	10.1109/CSF.2014.36	synchronization;verification;information privacy;computer science;theoretical computer science;database;probabilistic logic;hoare logic;privacy;computer security;differential privacy;algorithm	Security	-36.06449891014795	71.53460729116985	186021

In Akari, a labyrinth on a grid has to be lit by placing lanterns, respecting various constraints. In Takuzu a grid has to be filled with 0’s and 1’s, while respecting certain constraints. In Kakuro a grid has to be filled with numbers such that the sums per row and column match given values; similarly in KenKen a grid has to be filled with numbers such that in given areas the product, sum, difference or quotient equals a given value. We give physical algorithms to realize zero-knowledge proofs for these games which allow a player to show that he knows a solution without revealing it. These interactive proofs can be realized with simple office material as they only rely on cards and envelopes. Moreover, we formalize our algorithms and prove their security.	akari project;algorithm;cobra;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;hitori;interactive proof system;kakuro;ken's labyrinth;sudoku;zero-knowledge proof	Xavier Bultel;Jannik Dreier;Jean-Guillaume Dumas;Pascal Lafourcade	2016		10.4230/LIPIcs.FUN.2016.8	simulation;computer science;mathematics;computer security;algorithm;zero-knowledge proof	Theory	-38.18982899592642	74.30423422991625	186027

In this work we address the problem of secure outsourcing of large-scale biometric experiments to a cloud or grid in a way that the client can verify that with very high probability the task was computed correctly.

A natural step towards automation is to allow for symbolic security analysis. However, the complexity of mechanized symbolic analysis is typically exponential in the space and time complexities of the analyzed system. Thus, full automation via direct analysis of the entire given system has so far been impractical even for systems of modest complexity. We propose an alternative route to fully automated and efficient security analysis of systems with no a priori bound on the complexity. We concentrate on systems that have an unbounded number of components, where each component is of small size. The idea is to perform symbolic analysis that guarantees composable security. This allows applying the automated analysis only to individual components, while still guaranteeing security of the overall system. We exemplify the approach in the case of authentication and key-exchange protocols of a specific format. Specifically, we formulate and mechanically assert symbolic properties that correspond to concrete security properties formulated within the Universally Composable security framework. As an additional contribution, we demonstrate that the traditional symbolic secrecy criterion for key exchange provides an inadequate security guarantee (regardless of the complexity of verification) and propose a new symbolic criterion that guarantees composable concrete security.	authentication;concrete security;cryptographic protocol;exemplification;key exchange;time complexity;universal composability	Ran Canetti;Jonathan Herzog	2009	Journal of Cryptology	10.1007/s00145-009-9055-0	computer security model;computer science;theoretical computer science;concrete security;authentication;cryptographic protocol;distributed computing;security testing;computer security;algorithm	Security	-35.48506653091466	73.6752280578235	187112

Even if the cryptographic primitives underlying a protocol are secure, unexpected interactions between parts of the protocol or several instances of the same protocol can lead to catastrophic security breaches. Since protocol attacks tend to be very subtle and hard to catch during the design and analysis process, some computer assistance is desirable. The main contribution of this thesis is to demonstrate how fully automatic nite-state techniques can be used to analyze a wide variety of security protocols. While the general methodology of nite-state analysis, also referred to as model-checking, is well established in protocol veri cation, its application to security protocols is a recent area of research. Therefore, we present several case studies in which security protocols are simpli ed and formally modeled as nite-state systems. Automatic exhaustive state search is then performed. The search either discovers a state in which protocol correctness conditions are violated the sequence of steps leading to such a state from the start state represents a successful attack on the protocol, or proves the protocol correct subject to the limitations of the model. In our rst study, we analyze SSL 3.0, a real-world Internet security protocol that is widely deployed and used by millions of computer users. In the second study, we focus on fair exchange. Unlike the secrecy and authentication protocols that have traditionally been the subject of formal security analysis, fair exchange protocols are designed to guarantee properties such as fairness and accountability. Modeling these properties, and using automatic tools to discover attacks are important steps towards establishing nite-state analysis as a valid component of the protocol design process. The formal adversary model used in the case studies is relatively simple, treating the underlying cryptography as a perfect \black box."""" Nevertheless, the model is surprisingly e ective for discovering previously unknown weaknesses and attacks on published security protocols. All analyses described in this thesis were performed using a general-purpose nite-state tool called Mur'. To alleviate the state-space explosion problem, we developed several state reduction techniques that exploit fundamental properties of security protocols to reduce the size of the state graph that has to be explored by several orders of magnitude.

In particular we are interested in coercion-resistance and receipt-freeness. Intuitively, an election protocol is coercion-resistant if a voter A cannot prove to a potential coercer C that she voted in a particular way. We assume that A cooperates with C in an interactive fashion. Receipt-freeness is a weaker property, for which we assume that A and C cannot interact during the protocol: to break receipt-freeness, A later provides evidence (the receipt) of how she voted. While receipt-freeness can be expressed using observational equivalence from the applied pi calculus, we need to introduce a new relation to capture coercion-resistance. Our formalization of coercion-resistance and receipt-freeness are quite different. Nevertheless, we show in accordance with intuition that coercion-resistance implies receipt-freeness, which implies privacy, the basic anonymity property of voting protocols, as defined in previous work.

Today, businesses have turned to Write-One Read Many (WORM) storage technology to achieve compliance. But WORM answers only a part of the compliance puzzle; in addition to guaranteed document retention, businesses also need secure indexing, to ensure auditors can find required documents in a large database, secure deletion to expire documents (and their index entries) from storage once they are past their expiry period, and support for litigation holds, which require that certain documents are retained pending the resolution of active litigation. We build upon previous work in compliance storage and attribute-based encryption to design a system that satisfies all three of these requirements. In particular, we design a new encrypted index, which allows the owner of a database of documents to grant access to only those documents that match a particular query. This enables litigation holds for expired documents, and at the same time restricts auditor access for unexpired documents, greatly limiting the potential for auditor abuse as compared to previous work. We show by way of formal security proofs that our construction is secure and that it prevents reconstruction attacks wherein the index is used to recover the contents of the document. Our experiments show that our scheme can be practical for large databases and moderate sizes of queries.	attribute-based encryption;data erasure;database;experiment;requirement	Nikita Borisov;Soumyadeb Mitra	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-68914-0_23	computer science;data mining;database;computer security;algorithm;attribute-based encryption;satisfiability	DB	-40.760229758107116	67.67679193441286	189376

In this paper, we demonstrate that the UC-secure SSE scheme proposed by Kurosawa and Ohtaki is inefficient under certain scenarios, and we propose a modified scheme. Our scheme has reliability and privacy, where privacy is slightly weaker than the original Kurosawa-Ohtaki scheme. Therefore, our scheme offers UC-security with slightly weaker privacy. More precisely, the additional information our scheme leaks is only the size of a set of keywords. On the other hand, the index size for our scheme is much smaller than the original scheme when the set of keywords is a very sparse subset of l-bit strings for some l. The UC-secure Kurosawa-Ohtaki scheme is improved with the proposed scheme by introducing a new tag for proving """"non-existence.""""

We propose two different algorithms for DFA minimization in a secure multiparty computation setting, illustrating different aspects of programming based on universal composability and the constraints this sets on existing algorithms.

Although RFID ( Radio Frequency IDentification ) is becoming popular with pervasive computing environments, a privacy problem still remains, where an adversary can trace users' behavior by linking identification log by adversary readers. For this problem, a hash-chain scheme has been proposed as a secure identification for low-cost RFID tags, and its long identification time has been reduced by Avoine et al. using pre-computation on the server side. However, Avoine's scheme uses static pre-computation, and therefore pre-computed values include ones which are already used and no longer used. An efficient update of pre-computation is needed to remove these wasted values and this can reduce memory usage. In this paper, we optimize a lookup of pre-computed values using d-left hashing, which is a fast lookup technique, and provide efficient update of pre-computed values. We also show reasonable analytical evaluation and experimental result for memory and pre-computation/identification/update time.	adversary (cryptography);computation;hash chain;identification scheme;lookup table;precomputation;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;scalability;server (computing);server-side;ubiquitous computing	Yasunobu Nohara;Sozo Inoue	2010		10.1145/1741866.1741878	radio-frequency identification;double hashing;hash function;perfect hash function;sha-2;computer science;secure hash algorithm;secure hash standard;hash chain;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;ubiquitous computing;cryptographic hash function	Security	-39.29604512058974	68.01556618078396	192122

Zhang It is a well-acknowledged fact that collaboration between different members of a supply chain yields a significant potential to increase overall supply chain performance. Sharing private information has been identified as prerequisite for collaboration and, at the same time, as one of its major obstacles. One potential avenue for overcoming this obstacle is Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC). SMC is a cryptographic technique that enables the computation of any (well-defined) mathematical function by a number of parties without any party having to disclose its input to another party. In this paper, we show how SMC can be successfully employed to enable joint decision-making and benefit sharing in a simple supply chain setting. We develop secure protocols for implementing the well-known ‘‘Joint Economic Lot Size (JELS) Model” with benefit sharing in such a way that none of the parties involved has to disclose any private (cost and capacity) data. Thereupon, we show that although computation of the model’s outputs can be performed securely, the approach still faces practical limitations. These limitations are caused by the potential of ‘‘inverse optimization”, i.e., a party can infer another party’s private data from the output of a collaborative planning scheme even if the computation is performed in a secure fashion. We provide a detailed analysis of ‘‘inverse optimization” potentials and introduce the notion of ‘‘stochastic security”, a novel approach to assess the additional information a party may learn from joint computation and benefit sharing. Based on our definition of ‘‘stochastic security” we propose a stochastic benefit sharing rule, develop a secure protocol for this benefit sharing rule, and assess under which conditions stochastic benefit sharing can guarantee secure collaboration. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Many algorithms for VSS exist in the literature. These are of two types: small-error and error-free. In the small-error solutions, there is a small probability either that the dealer has not properly distributed the secret or that the faulty players can figure out the secret before reconstruction. In the error-free solutions neither of these can occur. However, the error-free solutions of which we are aware have a small weakness: the faulty processors can force a correct dealer to publicly reveal so much information that every correct processor learns the secret prematurely. This occurs despite the fact that no faulty processor learns anything at all about the secret. We overcome this weakness with no increase in the number of processors while remaining error-free.	verifiable secret sharing	Cynthia Dwork	1990		10.1007/3-540-54099-7_15	shamir's secret sharing;homomorphic secret sharing;secure multi-party computation;proactive secret sharing;secret sharing;verifiable secret sharing	Theory	-39.02807064195351	73.53075001019234	194294

While addressing these issues, Cryptography turns out to be the trusted brand in the computer science fraternity and Visual Cryptography, as one among this, is a methodology where the secret recovery is done with human visual system without having to perform complex calculations. The proposed scheme complies with the methodology of secret sharing scheme where secret information is divided into various shares in meaningless form and is further recovered on overlapping printed transparencies with the shared information on it. Each of them is then validated for authenticity. An attempt has been made to use circular rings to embed the secret information with certain angular rotation and validation of the individual cipher shared in order to avoid cheating.	angularjs;authentication;channel (communications);cipher;computer science;data access;printing;secret sharing;transparency (projection);visual cryptography	Sandeep Gurung;Bijoy Chhetri;Mrinal Kanti Ghose	2015	2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)	10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275898	shared secret;visualization;computer science;shamir's secret sharing;authentication;homomorphic secret sharing;secure multi-party computation;internet privacy;proactive secret sharing;secret sharing;world wide web;key distribution;computer security;verifiable secret sharing;encryption	Crypto	-40.4128162719184	72.43826283508926	194708
a16ab6d34536370e29216966b57b8fe83dd880af	fail-stop group signature scheme		In this paper, we propose a Fail-Stop Group Signature Scheme (FSGSS). FSGSS combines the features of the Group Signature and the Fail-Stop Signature to enhance the security level of the original Group Signature. Assuming that the FSGSS encounters an attack by a hacker armed with a supercomputer, this scheme can prove that the digital signature is indeed forged. Based on the above objectives, this paper proposes three lemmas and proves that they are indeed feasible. First, how does a recipient of a digitally signed document verify the authenticity of the signature? Second, when a digitally signed document is under dispute, how can the group’s manager find out the identity of the original group member who signed the document, if necessary for an investigation? Third, how can we prove that the signature is indeed forged following an external attack from a supercomputer? Soon, in a future paper, we will extend this work to make the scheme even more effective. Following an attack, the signature could be proved to be forged without the need to expose the key.	fail-stop;group signature;scheme;supercomputer	Yi-Yuan Chiang;Wang-Hsin Hsu;Wen-Yen Lin;Jonathan Jen-Rong Chen	2018	CoRR		group signature;hacker;theoretical computer science;digital signature;security level;computer science;supercomputer	Crypto	-40.90192525378261	73.80798177350526	196452

It provides one-to-one communication to dealer who want to connect with the other participants. The dealer chooses the detection or information mode by uniform distribution until he can make sure the information to the participant is safe, and then communicates with the next participant. It can prevent not only the external eavesdropping but also the internal cheating and ensure the validity of information shared to participant by this protocol.	formal verification;one-to-one (data model);paging;quantized state systems method;quantum entanglement;quantum teleportation;randomness;secret sharing	Xiaoqing Tan;Zhihong Feng;Lianxia Jiang;Afen Fang	2013	2013 Fourth International Conference on Emerging Intelligent Data and Web Technologies	10.1109/EIDWT.2013.44	theoretical computer science;quantum network;mathematics;distributed computing;homomorphic secret sharing;secure multi-party computation;proactive secret sharing;computer security;verifiable secret sharing;quantum cryptography	Robotics	-40.65914473796015	73.19910473454092	197591
fe2c4c7508f82d53b5c0b45f228bb63cc158569f	an efficient and secure outsourcing algorithm for bilinear pairing computation		Bilinear pairing computation is one of the most important cryptographic primitives, which is widely used in the public key encryption schemes. However, it has been considered the most expensive operation in the pairing-based cryptographic protocols. In this paper, we present an efficient and secure outsourcing algorithm for bilinear maps based on one untrusted servers. The client could outsource expensive computation to the cloud and perform simple operation to obtain the great efficiency. We analyze the security of this algorithm and compare it with prior works in efficiency. It is argued that our algorithm is more efficient and practical than the state of the art.	algorithm;bilinear transform;computation;outsourcing	Xiaoshuang Luo;Xiaoyuan Yang;Xiangzhou Niu	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-59463-7_33	cryptographic primitive;computation;theoretical computer science;cryptographic protocol;public-key cryptography;cloud computing;algorithm;computer science;secure two-party computation;pairing;server;distributed computing	Crypto	-40.159968606123726	70.3592205094379	197972
ad2b5355b04959ff5b9e914530976514a4ce172a	verifying security protocols using dynamic strategies		Current formal approaches have been successfully used to find design flaws in many security protocols. However, it is still challenging to automatically analyze protocols due to their large or infinite state spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that can automatically verifying security protocols without any human intervention. Experimental results show that SmartVerif automatically verifies security protocols that cannot be automatically verified by existing approaches. The case studies also validate the effectiveness of our dynamic strategy.

2104934d4e085feb4545d57866a0aa0e36f64f08	on the pseudorandom function assumption in (secure) distance-bounding protocols - prf-ness alone does not stop the frauds!	nccr mics secu;authentication;nccr mics;distance bounding;pseudorandom functions;relay attacks	In this paper, we show that many formal and informal security results on distance-bounding (DB) protocols are incorrect/ incomplete. We identify that this inadequacy stems from the fact that the pseudorandom function (PRF) assumption alone, invoked in many security claims, is insufficient. To this end, we identify two distinct shortcomings of invoking the PRF assumption alone: one leads to distance-fraud attacks, whilst the other opens for man-in-the-middle (MiM) attacks. First, we describe –in a more unitary, formal fashion– why assuming that a family of functions classically used inside DB protocols is solely a PRF is unsatisfactory and what generic security flaws this leads to. Then, we present concrete constructions that disprove the PRF-based claimed security of several DB protocols in the literature; this is achieved by using some PRF programming techniques. Whilst our examples may be considered contrived, the overall message is clear: the PRF assumption should be strengthened in order to attain security against distance-fraud and MiM attacks in distance-bounding protocols!	ca gen;computational hardness assumption;earthbound;intrusion detection system;man-in-the-middle attack;primitive recursive function;pseudorandom function family;pseudorandom number generator;pseudorandomness;while	Ioana Boureanu;Aikaterini Mitrokotsa;Serge Vaudenay	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33481-8_6	telecommunications;engineering;communication;computer security	Security	-37.28778498519024	73.44197222239477	199776
