The behaviour of such systems on the one hand depends on the structural dynamics of the system configuration, but on the other hand consists of the informational dynamics of the configuration. To specify and verify the properties of the system, including its configuration dynamics, a requirement language is needed that is capable to express those properties. In this paper, we discuss configuration dynamics properties of multi-agent systems and define a language by means of which those properties can be specified. A prototypical scenario for an agent-mediated system is discussed and some important requirements for this system are specified.		Mehdi Dastani;Catholijn M.

AGIMA is one distributed computing centered NM prototype system based on intelligent agent (IA) group. The modal logic, which was applied by early scholars when analyzing multi-agent knowledge system, has many drawbacks, while this paper exploits high-level Petri net graph for modeling AGIMA. After giving net graphs of agent and agent group, authors present their mappings to asynchronous and concurrent behavior and show their capacities of analysis and verification of properties within distributed knowledge base. Easy migration to object and layered model also brings net graph auxiliary functions to system implementation.

0ee15230971130ff66cb7be89cbda0f7be0d37e3	temporana: flexible temporal query processing for supporting system behavior detection across complex scenarios		We propose the TEMPORANA framework foranalysis of integrated scenarios aiming at studying the possibleeffects on the society of sustainable innovation policies. Theframework consists of a set of advanced temporal queries forscenario analysis and a software application. Integrated scenariosare possible future states of different aspects of the world(e.g., energy, environment, technology, economy, societal system) representing plausible conditions under different assumptions. Temporal scenario queries aim at detecting a specified behaviorfor the system over time and, hence, at verifying that a temporalproperty holds. A preliminary set of queries, each involving onetemporal operator from the Linear Temporal Logic, were definedby field experts and used in a preliminary experimentation todemonstrate the applicability of the approach.	integrated development environment;linear temporal logic;sensor;social system;verification and validation	Alfredo Cuzzocrea;Ilaria D'Elia;Antonio De Nicola;Hugo Maldini;Maria Luisa Villani	2016	2016 IEEE Intl Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and IEEE Intl Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC) and 15th Intl Symposium on Distributed Computing and Applications for Business Engineering (DCABES)	10.1109/CSE-EUC-DCABES.2016.215	ubiquitous computing;linear temporal logic;operator (computer programming);data mining;software;computer science	Embedded	-39.81387371410062	21.57448961172795	170227

We present an agent-based task handling mechanism in a peer-to-peer grid and then provide a macroscopic model to characterize the process of task handling. Our model consists of functional differential equations. Through case studies: (1) we show that our model is effective in characterizing the process of task handling; (2) we examine the effects of time delay, service time, etc. on the global performance of a peer-to-peer grid. Based on our model, we further simulate a complete process of task handling in a grid and show the main characteristics of a real grid.	agent-based model;broadcast delay;peer-to-peer;simulation	Xiaolong Jin;Jiming Liu;Zhen Yang	2004	Proceedings.

639777f272dfdbe1cfe44a7c87389be0a4ccb512	intelligent os x malware threat detection with code inspection		With the increasing market share of Mac OS X operating system, there is a corresponding increase in the number of malicious programs (malware) designed to exploit vulnerabilities on Mac OS X platforms. However, existing manual and heuristic OS X malware detection techniques are not capable of coping with such a high rate of malware. While machine learning techniques offer promising results in automated detection of Windows and Android malware, there have been limited efforts in extending them to OS X malware detection. In this paper, we propose a supervised machine learning model. The model applies kernel base Support Vector Machine and a novel weighting measure based on application library calls to detect OS X malware. For training and evaluating the model, a dataset with a combination of 152 malware and 450 benign were created. Using common supervised Machine Learning algorithm on the dataset, we obtain over 91% detection accuracy with 3.9% false alarm rate. We also utilize Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to create three synthetic datasets with different distributions based on the refined version of collected dataset to investigate impact of different sample sizes on accuracy of malware detection. Using SMOTE datasets we could achieve over 96% detection accuracy and false alarm of less than 4%. All malware classification experiments are tested using cross validation technique. Our results reflect that increasing sample size in synthetic datasets has direct positive effect on detection accuracy while increases false alarm rate in compare to the original dataset.

This paper presents an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the MUSBUS approach, suggests ways in which the methodology may be applied to produce more accurate predictions of system performance, and introduces three new tool sets that may be used to increase the accuracy of performance predictions based upon synthetic benchmarks. These tool sets support realistic emulation of end-user behaviour at a terminal-like interface, provide parametric-driven emulation of both application programs and an underlying DBMS, and assist in the population of synthetic databases with records whose attribute values are both realistic and satisfy the semantic integrity constraints of the database schema. If one accepts the assertion that the construction of synthetic benchmarks with acceptable performance accuracy is a technically feasible goal, then the benefits of good benchmark development extend into the deployment and production phases of a system's life-cycle, and as a consequence it is argued that the cost of good benchmark development can be more than re-couped over a system's life-time	benchmark (computing)	Ken J.

The model is based on a multilevel, hierarchical, general object-oriented approach. Current methods and software design and development tools for intelligent systems are usually difficult extend, and it is not easy to reuse their components in developing intelligent systems. The OBOA model tries to reduce these deficiencies. The model starts with a well-founded software engineering principle, making clear distinction between generic, low-level intelligent software components, and domain-dependent, high-level components of an intelligent system. This paper concentrates on modeling and implementation of fuzzy logic concepts within the hierarchical levels of the OBOA model. The fuzzy components described are extensible and adjustable. As an illustration of how these components are used in practice, a practical design example is shown. The paper also suggests some steps towards future design of fuzzy components and tools for intelligent systems.	fuzzy logic	Ramo Sendelj;Vladan Devedzic	1999		10.1007/978-3-540-48765-4_8	fuzzy logic;fuzzy electronics;systems modeling;intelligent decision support system;computer science;artificial intelligence;component-based software engineering;software development;neuro-fuzzy;programming language;object-oriented programming;algorithm;fuzzy control system;hierarchical database model	Logic	-37.571372814476845	24.298797778553272	176209

This model consists of two important ideas: a real-time logical negotiation protocol and a case-based negotiation model. The protocol integrates a real-time Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model, a temporal logic model, and communicative acts for negotiation. This protocol explicitly defines the logical and temporal relationships of different knowledge states, facilitating real-time designs such as multi-threaded processing, state profiling and updating, and a set of real-time enabling functional predicates in our implementation. To further support the protocol, we use a case-based reasoning model for negotiation strategy selection. An agent learns from its past experience by deriving a negotiation strategy from the most similar and useful case to its current situation. Guided by the strategy, the agent negotiates with its partners using an argumentation-based negotiation protocol. The model is time and situation aware such that each agent changes its negotiation behavior according to the progress and status of the ongoing negotiation and its current agent profile. We apply the negotiation model to a resource allocation problem and obtain promising results.	agile software development;autonomous agent;autonomous robot;belief–desire–intention software model;card security code;case-based reasoning;consumability;encapsulation (networking);experiment;functional programming;input/output (c++);integrated windows authentication;logical framework;multi-agent system;multi-core processor;nsa product types;parsing;persistence (computer science);planning;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;reflection (computer programming);sensor;state diagram;state transition table;temporal logic;terabyte;thread (computing)	Leen-Kiat Soh;Costas Tsatsoulis	2005	Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems	10.1007/s10458-005-0539-5	use case;situation awareness;case-based reasoning;temporal logic;resource allocation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;autonomous agent;multi-agent system	AI	-36.3847068335602	21.964041484040546	177187

A problem representation from the centralized and distributed point of view makes the partial graphs the useful tool for a multiagent system designer. It also creates an environment capable of verifying the features of multiagent systems (represented by graph metrics) by simulation of a multiagent system behavior.	agent-based model;graph rewriting	Leszek Kotulski;Adam Sedziwy	2010	Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory	10.1016/j.simpat.2010.05.013	discrete mathematics;graph product;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;multi-agent system;graph;bond graph;intersection graph;graph rewriting	AI	-39.650219663321	22.43830349004775	178631

Task execution typically requires that an agent be able to act reactively in its dynamic, unpredictable world. This is all the more true in dialogue planning and execution, in which agents’ goals and beliefs are often changing or opaque. Dialogue planning and execution is reactive in nature. Therefore, systems for dialogue interaction should have at their core a reactive task execution architecture. This paper was originally entitled “Dialog is task execution; task execution is best done reactively; therefore, dialog systems call for a reactive task execution architecture” Dialogue is task execution Throughout the history of natural language dialogue research, taking part in dialogue has been seen as a planful activity; that is, engaging in dialogue has been viewed (from various research perspectives) as an activity which involves agents’ goals, and plans to achieve those goals. Engaging in a dialogue is engaging in a particular kind of task. Dialogue execution shares many of the same requirements with other kinds of task execution. For example: • Agents can have multiple goals active simultaneously, • Agents can be attempting to achieve these goals simultaneously, • The world in which agents act is often unpredictable and often changing, • Tasks and goals can be described hierarchically, • Resources available for achieving goals vary, • Goals can have differing priorities, which may vary dynamically, • Tasks will sometimes fail to achieve their goals, • Multiple agents will be attempting to achieve their goals simultaneously, perhaps collaboratively, and so on. Although it is true that engaging in natural language dialogue has different qualities from non-dialogue tasks (for example, natural language is rife with vague descriptions whose meanings must be negotiated; dialogue almost immediately requires one to address issues of other agents’ beliefs, goals and intentions), it is equally true that many non-dialogue tasks share these same qualities. For example, we have argued that descriptions have value for tasks beyond natural language dialogue (Fitzgerald and Firby 1996). In the end, dialogue planning and execution is task planning and execution.	automated planning and scheduling;dialog system;natural language;rife;requirement;speculative execution;vagueness	Jesper Andersson;Bengt Lennartsson	1999		10.1109/HICSS.1999.773100	multilayered architecture;agent architecture;reference architecture;software architecture;computer architecture;architecture tradeoff analysis method;verification and validation;real-time computing;database-centric architecture;architectural pattern;computer science;software design;social software engineering;software framework;component-based software engineering;software development;software design description;software agent;middleware;software construction;software architecture description;resource-oriented architecture;software deployment;software system	NLP	-39.59704288437536	19.249717521777036	183468

Existing systems often adhere to a heavy-weight approach. This means that, firstly, some do not build on existing tourism information systems, secondly, most of them do not employ standards for accessing geographical information systems, and thirdly, the majority employ a thick client. To tackle these issues, we propose a lightweight approach for location based systems. A major focus is on configurability, allowing to easily making existing tourism information location-aware, by pinpointing points of interest to geographical positions on a map. To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, a prototype of a mobile tourist guide has been implemented for the city of Linz, Austria, which delivers geographic data in form of maps or aerial photos and information about local points of interest.	aerial photography;fat client;geographic information system;location awareness;location-based service;map;point of interest;prototype	Wieland Schwinger;Christoph Grün;Birgit Pröll;Werner Retschitzegger;Hannes Werthner	2006		10.1007/3-211-32710-X_6	point of interest;geographic information system;internet privacy	HCI	-35.84732745539385	18.542830171153078	184138

Frequently, choreography models are used for agreeing about the overall message exchanges among integration partners while executable orchestration models derived from the choreography govern the local message flow of each individual participant. Today, ebXML BPSS (ebBP) as a dedicated B2Bi choreography language and WS-BPEL as the de-facto standard for Web service based orchestration modeling provide the technological basis for integrating choreographies and orchestrations in the B2Bi domain. This paper introduces the concept of partner-shared states into ebXML BPSS (ebBP) choreography modeling in order to enable complex integration scenarios and shows how to implement these using Web services and WS-BPEL technology. Shared states explicitly represent the effect of business document exchanges, provide natural synchronization points for attaching admissible message exchange actions, and allow for controlling distributed timeouts as well as comprehensibly communicating the interaction’s progress. We provide a workaround for modeling shared states in an ebBP schema compliant way as well as an ebBP schema extension that enables intuitive and straightforward models. A formalization of shared state-based ebBP models is introduced as concise basis for automatically translating extension-based ebBP models into workaround-based ebBP models. An operational semantics for shared state-based ebBP models using this formalization is utilized for comprehensibility because ebBP itself does not define clear semantics.

e3c5bac413057e864f7aa972c482fa6391c9212a	an agent based model for health surveillance systems and early biological threat detection		Recent advances in biological sciences have made hostile biological attacks increasingly available to terrorist groups. The success of these threats is based on the assumption that biological attacks are invisible and will not be rapidly recognized as deliberate attacks. Current epidemic surveillance systems use data available from sources such as hospitals, clinics, and medical laboratories to analyze epidemic trends over time and are not capable of detecting such threats in a timely manner. In this paper, we present a multi-agent based system for early biological threat detection. At the micro-level, monitored humans are equipped with personal agents that are responsible for capturing the data transmitted by the wearable sensors, performing basic processing and analysis, and transmitting the collected data to higher-level agents for further processing. At the macro-level, a hierarchy of specialized agents are responsible for collecting, analyzing the transmitted data, and rapidly detecting possible epidemic threats. The experimental results show that the proposed model is able to effectively detect and localize epidemic threats with a various number of simulated humans.	agent-based model;algorithm;artificial intelligence;download;multi-agent system;scalability;sensor;threat (computer);transmitter;wearable computer	Mohammad Al-Zinati;Qutaibah Althebyan;Yaser Jararweh	2018	2018 IEEE 6th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud (FiCloud)	10.1109/FiCloud.2018.00016	agent-based model;computer security;wearable computer;business	AI	-34.715840498758766	20.810407832872247	184634

So-called B2B protocols provide for the formal specification of relevant aspects of an interface, ranging from document types to transactions. Currently, there are two main approaches proposed for the specification of B2B protocols, the WSDL-based approach supporting Web Service languages, and the ebXML-based approach supporting languages defined along the ebXML project. Unfortunately, these approaches are not compatible, thus an organization wanting to engage in B2B collaboration needs to decide whether to embark on any of these new approaches, and which ones to use. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for B2B protocols, and based on this framework, a methodical comparison of the two approaches is provided, answering the questions of what the differences are and whether there are chances to achieve interoperability.	business process;ebxml;file spanning;formal specification;interoperability;loose coupling;software system;web services description language;web service	Martin Bernauer;Gerti Kappel;Gerhard Kramler	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-24593-3_16	web service;interoperability;xml;aspect-oriented programming;transaction processing;computer science;data mining;formal specification;conceptual framework;database;business process;programming language;law;world wide web;software system	SE	-40.6623187566175	24.34220055073766	185871

At the same time there has been a rise in malware targeting the platform, with more recent strains employing highly sophisticated detection avoidance techniques. As traditional signature based methods become less potent in detecting unknown malware, alternatives are needed for timely zero-day discovery. Thus this paper proposes an approach that utilizes ensemble learning for Android malware detection. It combines advantages of static analysis with the efficiency and performance of ensemble machine learning to improve Android malware detection accuracy. The machine learning models are built using a large repository of malware samples and benign apps from a leading antivirus vendor. Experimental results and analysis presented shows that the proposed method which uses a large feature space to leverage the power of ensemble learning is capable of 97.3 % to 99% detection accuracy with very low false positive rates.

The problem to be solved is how to model conflict situations where there is uncertainty about agreement, neutrality and disagreement among agents in a conflict situation. The solution to this problem includes modeling a conflict situation relative to basic binary relations on a universe of agents, introducing a measure of the degree of conflict, and encapsulating a conflict situation in an information system. The basic approach to modeling conflict situations is illustrated in the context of contract negotiation during the initial phases of requirement negotiation for a systems engineering project. An example of a high-level requirements negotiation for an automated lighting system is presented. The contribution of this paper is a rough set based requirements determination model using a conflict relation for representing requirements agreements (or disagreements).	contract management;design by contract;high- and low-level;information system;requirement;rough set;systems engineering	Andrzej Skowron;Sheela Ramanna;James F.

However this is not a guarantee for discovering all the subproblems that compose the structure of a given software problem. Moreover, a rigorous application of the technique requires a previous consensus about the meaning of I. Jacobson’s statement “a use case must give a measurable value to a particular actor” (The Rational Edge, March 2003). This paper proposes a particular characterisation of the concept of “value” with the purpose of problem structuring. To this aim we base on the catalogue of frames for real software problems proposed by M. Jackson (Problem Frames, 2001) and we reason about what could be valuable for the user on each problem class. We illustrate our technique with the analysis of a web auction problem. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This is due to their orientation to a monolithic inference mechanism that is based on causal evaluation implemented by means of searches over passive computational entities. The Notification-Oriented Paradigm (NOP) was conceived as a new approach for conception, structuring, and execution of software leading to performance improvements, organization of causal knowledge, and decoupling of programming entities. The NOP introduces a different manner of structuring software and realization of its inferences, which are based upon small, smart, and decoupled collaborative entities that interact by means of precise notifications. In this way, NOP achieves responsiveness, distributiveness, consistency, and robustness. These features are among the demands of Real-Time Systems. This paper analyzes the NOP applicability to Real-Time Systems by confronting the demands of the latter with the characteristics of the former. As conclusion, the NOP is considered applicable to this sort of computational system.	causal filter;computation;computer programming;coupling (computer programming);declarative programming;degree of parallelism;entity;imperative programming;nop;parallel computing;programming paradigm;real-time clock;real-time operating system;real-time transcription;requirement;responsiveness;scheduling (computing);scheduling analysis real-time systems;software development;static timing analysis	Robson Ribeiro Linhares;Douglas P.

ae88896e6c370cf1824726924d0a80fd712fd372	living with artificial intelligence: a paradigm shift toward future network traffic control		Future Internet is expected to meet explosive traffic growth and extremely complex architecture, which tend to make the traditional NTC strategies inefficient and even ineffective. Inspired by the latest breakthroughs of AI and its power to address large-scale and complex difficulties, the network community has begun to consider shifting the NTC paradigm from legacy rule-based to novel AI-based. As an applied inter-discipline, design and implementation are important. Although there have been some preliminary explorations along this frontier, they are either limited by only envisioning the prospects, or too scattered to provide high-level insight into a general methodology. To this end, we start with the domain knowledge relationships of AI and NTC, summarizing a baseline workflow toward deep reinforcement learning, which will be the dominant method for the AI-NTC paradigm. On top of that, we argue that AI-NTC training and running must be carried out in online environments in closed-loop fashion for the purpose of putting ti into practice. A series of challenges and opportunities are discussed from a realistic viewpoint, and a set of new architecture and mechanism to enable the online and closed-loop AI-NTC paradigm are proposed. Hopefully, this work can help the AI community to better understand NTC and the NTC community to better live with AI.

In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing a language, called ccSCEL, that combines abstractions and primitives specifically devised for programming autonomic systems by also using constraints and operations on them. We show that constraints permit addressing issues related to the programming of autonomic systems, since they are suitable means to deal with, e.g., partial knowledge, multi-criteria optimisation, preferences, uncertainty. We also present an advanced form of interaction that is particularly convenient in this setting. It allows a component of a system to access the constraint-based knowledge of all components checking its consistency and implications.	autonomic computing	Ugo Montanari;Rosario Pugliese;Francesco Tiezzi	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-15545-6_36	tuple space;dynamism;service-level agreement;abstraction;distributed computing;computer science	Robotics	-38.209553681457265	18.628915270539306	189960

The IoT provides connectivity of things dynamically to the network whereas cloud computing provides virtualization in storage and processing. In CloudIoT paradigm, cloud and IoT are merged together to provide complementary features in smart applications/services. CloudIoT solutions make it possible to envisage ubiquitous and pervasive connectivity to the users. The source of livelihood for a majority of the population is agriculture; it mantles a dominant role in the economy of the country. The proposed work focuses on CloudIoT architecture for providing any smart solutions in different sectors. A case study of a smart irrigation system is discussed in the paper. A smart irrigation system is developed using the lightweight protocol, MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport). MQTT protocol is 22% more energy efficient and 15% faster when compared with other protocols. The temperature and soil moisture data are collected and managed by Amazon cloud. The data analysis is performed using the Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) tool. The cost-effective solution is demonstrated and results speak the strength and performance of the system.	amazon elastic compute cloud (ec2);amazon web services;amazona;cloud computing;computation (action);emergence;internet of things;irrigation;lightweight protocol;mqtt;machine learning;merge;message queue;pervasive informatics;programming paradigm;protocols documentation;solutions;weka	Meenaxi M.

Although the power industry has been battling weather-induced failures for years, it is largely unknown how resilient the energy infrastructure and services really are to severe weather disruptions. What fundamental issues govern the resilience? Can advanced approaches such as modeling and data analytics help industry to go beyond empirical methods? This paper discusses the research to date and open issues related to these questions. The focus is on identifying fundamental challenges and advanced approaches for quantifying resilience. In particular, the first aspect of this problem is how to model large-scale failures, recoveries, and impacts, involving the infrastructure, service providers, customers, and weather. The second aspect is how to identify generic vulnerability in the infrastructure and services through large-scale data analytics. The third aspect is to understand what resilience metrics are needed and how to develop them.	big data;bottom-up proteomics;cyber resilience;dsos;interaction;relevance;stationary process;stochastic process	Chuanyi Ji;Yun Wei;H.

By transferring the concepts of agentorientation to a plug-in-based architecture we are able to design our application and the plug-in-based system on an abstract level. Moreover, general problems that evolve from a highly dynamic and configurable architecture have been solved by basing the conceptual design on multi-agent principles. In this paper we discuss the general properties of extensible systems and the benefits that can be achieved when applying the multi-agent view to their architecture. In addition to the conceptual modeling of such architectures, we provide a practical example where the concept has been successfully applied in the development of the latest release of Renew. Through the introduction of the multi-agent concepts, the new architecture is now – at runtime – dynamically extensible by registering plug-ins with the management system.	agent architecture;agent-based model;applications architecture;code refactoring;dynamical system;extensibility;first-order predicate;function model;multi-agent system;nets within nets;petri net;plug-in (computing);programming paradigm;refinement (computing);run time (program lifecycle phase);semantics (computer science);simulation;software architecture;visual modeling;way to go	Lawrence Cabac;Michael Duvigneau;Daniel Moldt;Heiko Rölke	2005		10.1007/11752660_15	enterprise architecture framework;reference architecture;space-based architecture;simulation;database-centric architecture;computer science;systems engineering;applications architecture;artificial intelligence;solution architecture;software architecture description;view model	AI	-39.60481197117522	24.77789248537664	190813

On the one hand, multi-agent systems (MASs) provide mechanisms that allow t o manage open, dynamic systems. Indeed, agents are active entities that uses high-level com munication capabilities to autonomously manage collaborations with other agents. On the other hand, muti-agent systems lack some mechanisms to enforce rigorous developpment and run-t ime reliability as compared to component-based systems. For example, very few MASs provid e a dedicated exception handling system (EHS) and, to our knowledge, none of the existing ones fully conforms to the agent paradigm (agent autonomy, cooperative concurrency).

When the interaction scheme that the services should follow is given (e.g. as a choreography or as an interaction protocol), it becomes possible to verify, before the interaction takes place, if the interactive behavior of a service (e.g. a BPEL process specification) respects it. This verification is known as “conformance test”. Recently some attempts have been done for defining conformance tests w.r.t. a protocol but these approaches fail in capturing the very nature of interoperability, turning out to be too restrictive. In this work we give a representation of protocol, based on message exchange and on finite state automata, and we focus on those properties that are essential to the verification of the interoperability of a set of services. In particular, we define a conformance test that can guarantee, a priori, the interoperability of a set of services by verifying properties of the single service against the protocol. This is particularly relevant in open environments, where services are identified and composed on demand and dynamically, and the system as a whole cannot be analyzed.	abductive reasoning;automata theory;bisimulation;business process execution language;conformance testing;data structure;declarative programming;emoticon;finite-state machine;inferring horizontal gene transfer;interaction protocol;interoperability;model checking;multi-agent system;process specification;service composability principle;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;tracing (software);verification and validation;web service	Matteo Baldoni;Cristina Baroglio;Alberto Martelli;Viviana Patti	2006		10.1007/11948148_28	semantic interoperability;interoperability;the internet;computer science;operating system;conformance testing;database;distributed computing;finite-state machine;open system;computer security	Networks	-40.1594054169859	24.857056756584306	191745

In this research, we consider the related problem of malware classification based on HMMs. We train multiple HMMs on a variety of compilers and malware generators. More than 8,000 malware samples are then scored against these models and separated into clusters based on the resulting scores. We observe that the clustering results could be used to classify the malware samples into their appropriate families with good accuracy. Since none of the malware families in the test set were used to generate the HMMs, these results indicate that our approach can effective classify previously unknown malware, at least in some cases. Thus, such a clustering strategy could serve as a useful tool in malware analysis and classification.	cluster analysis;compiler;hidden markov model;malware analysis;markov chain;sensor;test set	Chinmayee Annachhatre;Thomas H.

We show that it can be applied for modeling and verification (testing correctness) of cyclogram models (CM). We describe how a rule-based knowledge base of a CM and instruments for constructing algorithms that output discrete controlling influences can be used to improve testing quality. DOI: 10.1134/S0005117913100159 At present, an important problem in constructing test automation systems is the relatively low expressiveness of ACSTP development methods in creating software systems that would be able to function efficiently under a changing technological process (TP). This is an especially acute problem in solving complex problems in creating test control systems (CS) that have to provide support for different algorithms for producing controlling influences and ensure high quality testing. A traditional approach to developing ACSTP software in general and testing CS in particular involves a detailed definition of all software control algorithms for technical means (controllers) at the stage of specification. We mean here that test conditions and parameters of the control object are unchanged and known in advance. In this approach, an operator can choose the needed algorithm out of a predefined list of implemented algorithms depending on the test mode immediately during the testing. But what can we do if the objects under testing have different constructive and technological features and, correspondingly, different testing parameters and conditions? Obviously we have to come back to the CS developer or, which is often even more problematic, transfer a part of the system’s source code and organize the corresponding access for a third-party developer. One efficient solution for this problem would be to provide the CS operator with a possibility to specify and edit testing algorithms without writing source code—“programming without programmers.” To do that, we need to perform preliminary modeling for a specific testing control TP. The resulting model can be used as a basis in developing the corresponding CS software. This solution works well if we construct a specific automation system. On the other hand, easy development and scaling of individual automation systems is possible if they had been constructed as “technologically” as possible, with universal methodologies and instruments. In this case systems possess the “complementarity” property, and we have a possibility to construct complex automation systems. This is the most efficient solution for upgrading the experimental–testing base of a company as a whole.1 When automation systems are technological, it means that a unified approach to developing individual elements and subsystems has been used. Therefore, developing specialized models for the testing control process “de novo” for each testing unit or TP becomes suboptimal and workconsuming.

The agents attempt to optimize the use of their own consumable resources while adhering to the global goal, i.e., accurate and effective multisensor target tracking. Agents negotiate based on different strategies which are selected and instantiated using case-based reasoning (CBR). Agents are also fully reflective in that they are aware of all their resources including system-level ones such as CPU allocation, and this allows them to achieve real-time behavior. We focus our discussion on multisensor target racking, case-based negotiation, and real-time behavior, and present experimental results comparing our methodology to ones using either no negotiation or using a static negotiation protocol.	agent-based model;case-based reasoning;central processing unit;computational resource;consumability;experience;experiment;multi-agent system;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time operating system;real-time transcription;reasoning system;scheduling (computing);thread (computing)	Leen-Kiat Soh;Costas Tsatsoulis	2001			use case;simulation;artificial intelligence;linguistics;satisfiability	AI	-38.04430877709026	20.799071039762463	193086
ac7839fd2972e00bd6e45d5b330f15421ec75eef	analyze cost-efficient system for small uas tracking using agent-based modeling		Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for recreational use, which are low-cost and easy-to-use, have begun to gain popularity recently. Flying those UAS in public areas, however, increases threats in terms of safety of people. To prevent people from such threats, we consider a design, modeling, and evaluation of a cost-efficient sensor system in order to detect and track UAS. In this research, we focus on discovering best configurations of deploying different types of sensors in a designated area, which provides reasonable detection rates and lowest costs as well. We set a condition that crowded areas should be covered more than other areas. Two types of sensors are considered to be deployed in the designated area to detect small UAS. Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) helps us analyze such configurations depending on the types and the number of radars in terms of cost-efficiency. The result of ABM simulation shows a list of candidate configurations that can be referred for the real deployment. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Initially this step was performed manually by the modeler, and required a great deal of experience and ingenuity. Subsequently, the research has focused on techniques to automate such symmetries exploitation to simplify the modeler's task and still allow the solution of reasonably complex models. We recall some of the steps of this evolution, that has now simplified the definition of efficiently solvable models. We also attempt to devise some future perspectives to work on.

Software patches and upgrades to anti-viral packages are typically released only after the malware's key characteristics have been identified through infection, by which time it may be too late to protect systems. Sequence analysis is widely used in bioinformatics for revealing the genetic diversity of organisms and annotating gene functions. This paper adopts a new approach to the problem of malware recognition, which is to use multiple sequence alignment techniques from bioinformatics to align variable length computer viral and worm code so that core, invariant regions of the code occupy fixed positions in the alignment patterns. Data mining (ANNs, symbolic rule extraction) can then be used to learn the critical features that help to determine into which class the aligned patterns fall. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our novel approach for identifying malware code through multiple sequence alignment followed by analysis by ANNs and symbolic rule extraction methods.	align (company);artificial neural network;bioinformatics;computer security;data mining;malware;multiple sequence alignment;patch (computing);rule induction;sequence analysis	Yi Chen;Ajit Narayanan;Shaoning Pang;Ban Tao	2012	2012 8th International Conference on Natural Computation	10.1109/ICNC.2012.6234576	computer science;bioinformatics;data mining;world wide web	SE	-35.17301247327826	23.13767481375783	194529
48ba5950c8b3809a612579b1163355da6b526190	means for realizing interactions		In software engineering interactions are often considered in the sense of a simple request/reply pattern, which is able to adequately describe the common case of action execution or information retrieval. Besides this simple scheme there are also many real world scenarios in which more elaborated interactions are necessary. These interactions comprise e.g. different types of auctions and other negotiation schemes that may be multi-party and multi-stepped so that reaching agreement is a difficult task. One well-known technique for modeling and implementing interactions are interaction protocols, which exactly define the allowed message sequences in a conversation. Despite many advantages such as automatic execution using interpreter or generator approaches, protocol based interactions also have deficiencies with respect to interaction flexibility and also implementation efforts. In the area of multi-agent systems several approaches have been developed to overcome these limitations. One mechanism is based on interaction goals allowing a developer to think only in terms of the interaction domain objectives she wants to achieve so that no messages have to be handled directly. For goal achievement behind the scenes predefined protocols are executed. Another interesting approach relies on commitments, which highlight the available interaction related actions of the entities participating in a conversation. This relieves a developer from thinking in terms of messages and shifts the focus towards the underlying communication intentions and obligations of the participants. In this way the allowed message sequences is implicitly gained from specified commitments and actions so that protocols become more flexible.	entity;information retrieval;interaction protocol;interpreter (computing);multi-agent system;request–response;software engineering	Lars Braubach;Alexander Pokahr	2011			common value auction;conversation;distributed computing;interpreter;negotiation;computer science	Web+IR	-39.28641588736754	19.63530455316567	194750
e52120fea840609df827dc3041011934a616df2d	ransomware detection by mining api call usage		In the recent past one of the harmful forms of malware seen is the Ransomware. The year 2016 has seen a huge rise in ransomware attacks. According to the study by Tripwire, Ransomware has done the most amount of damage to organizations in 2017, followed by DDoS, Malicious Insiders, Phishing, and Known/Unknown Vulnerabilities. In this work, Application Programming Interface (API) calls are extracted from the executables and the most discriminating API calls are used to train a classifier to detect unknown ransomware. We have tested our method on various classifiers like Decision trees, KNN, Random forest. Class imbalance due to the difference in the number of samples available in two classes - Ransomware and benign is also considered. It is seen that Random forest with smote for class imbalance has given a detection rate of over 98%. A large number of ransomware samples have been analyzed and the discriminating API calls have been identified.	application programming interface;decision tree;denial-of-service attack;executable;extraction;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;malware;phishing;random forest;trees (plant)	Shina Sheen;A.

6c5a47bd342b4c5405f4c8aacb56c413d739fade	intelligent big data processing		Nowadays, data comes from sensors, lab experiments, simulations, individual archives, enterprise and Internet in all scales and formats. This data flood has outpaced our capability to process, analyze, store and understand these datasets. Such rapid expansion is also accelerated by the dramatic increase in acceptance of social media and networking applications [1]. Furthermore, it can be foreseen that Internet of things (IoT) applications [2] will raise the scale of data to an unprecedented level. People and devices (from home coffee machines to cars, to buses, railway stations and airports) are all loosely connected. Trillions of such connected components will generate a huge data ocean, and valuable information must be discovered from the data to help improve quality of life and make our world a better place. This special issue is in response to the increasing convergence among grid and cloud computing [3] and big data intelligence; while different approaches exist, challenges and opportunities are numerous in this context. The research papers selected for this special issue represent recent progresses in the field, including works on big data architectures, big data processing systems, big data management, and big data applications and modeling, MapReduce optimization, resources allocation [4], resource monitoring, energy-aware resource provisioning. All of these papers not only provide novel ideas and state-of-the-art techniques in the field, but also stimulate future research in the sustainable environment.	archive;big data;cloud computing;connected component (graph theory);experiment;information explosion;internet of things;mapreduce;mathematical optimization;our world;provisioning;sensor;simulation;social media	Ching-Hsien Hsu	2014	Future Generation Comp.

The key challenge in designing such systems is to provide a framework for interoperability of emergency services in disaster situations. The goal of the paper is to provide an insight into modelling techniques for studying emergency services interoperability functions in system design to avoid hidden points of failures. Concepts of artificial Neuro-Immune-Endocrine (NIE) homeostatic models [21][22][24] for autonomous self-configuring and self-healing systems are discussed. The paper features examples of collaborative software agents' behaviour in hostile environments, cooperating protocols, smart embedded devices and pro-active infrastructures in various areas related to emergency services operations.

Inspired by the self-develop and learn of human immune system, AIS is referred as a novel evolutionary paradigm. Combination of AIS and agent in workflow management system makes it more interoperable, robust, autonomous and intelligent in a distributed environment. A solution to a management information system (JYMIS) based on workflow is presented, in which the method of aiAgent is applied.

Conventional formalizations of agents as HMM do not take changes of environments in account, so that it is hard to analyze behaviors of agents that act in dynamic environments. The proposed formalization enables HMM to handles changes of environment and interaction among agents via environment directly inside of state-transitions. I first investigate HMM that represents changes of the environment in the same state-transitions of agent itself. Then I derive a structured model in which environment, agent, and another agent are treated as separated state-transitions and coupled with each other. For this model, in order to reduce the number of parameters, I introduce “symmetricity” among agents. Moreover, I discuss relation between reducing dependency in transitions and assumption of cooperative behaviors in MAS.	hidden markov model;markov chain;multi-agent system	Itsuki Noda	2002		10.1007/3-540-45683-X_16	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;interconnection;transition state;hidden markov model	AI	-39.046809683096875	24.79178811361195	198630
