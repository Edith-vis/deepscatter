ADIs typically deal with data collection workflows from arbitrary numbers of data sources, with heterogeneous access protocols, data exchange formats, and data models. Besides, they handle data processing workflows for the harmonization and enrichment of aggregated metadata. Correct workflow management is crucial to ensure Information Space consistency, but is in general hard to sustain. This demo will present the solution offered in the context of the OpenAIRE infrastructure, which today collects metadata and files from around 450+ data sources (and growing) of several typologies. The D-NET Workflow Management Suite user interfaces support data curators at orchestrating overtime and in a sustainable way the configuration, execution, and monitoring of data collection and processing workflows for thousands of data sources."""	data model;gene ontology term enrichment;portals;spaces;user interface	Michele Artini;Claudio Atzori;Paolo Manghi	2014	IEEE/ACM Joint Conference on Digital Libraries		web service;data modeling;spatial data infrastructure;full text search;computer science;data mining;database;enterprise data management;user interface;world wide web;data element;data mapping;metadata repository;data collection	DB	-38.02909938308649	1.2726764756328703	194084
8f59fe3910a2f9ea01d1054e570c6990c5fb09ce	a semantic wiki for novelty search on documents		Technology-oriented companies are typically interested in monitoring developments concerning their technologies. However, most companies, especially SMEs, don’t have an efficient process how this is achieved. If at all, efforts are mostly limited to uncoordinated keyword queries on web resources. Here, we present a semi-automatic approach that allows for structured and continuous detection of relevant, novel and domain specific documents appearing on the Web. Our system is based on a semantic wiki where the domain expert is able (i) to store all relevant information in an adequate knowledge base with the ability for monitoring and trend mining and (ii) to import detected novel items such as future technologies and their properties to the knowledge base in a continuos fashion. The latter is achieved by generating a structured query based on the user context and by representing found documents as semantic graphs. In this way, novel items can be found easier and in a semi-automatic fashion.	graph (discrete mathematics);knowledge base;semiconductor industry;subject-matter expert;web resource;wiki;world wide web	Michael Färber;Achim Rettinger	2013			computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-40.04681407038302	3.824450871690399	194488
5e40ca97d597aabb2f3e2df1b175f4883f8320a3	information-computational system for online analysis of georeferenced climatological data		An Internet accessible information-computational system (ICS) is dedicated to visualization and analysis of geospatial gridded datasets in the area of Earth system science (local observations, remote sensing and modeling) and climatology in particular. This online ICS is based on a dedicated software framework consisting of three key parts: server-side computational back-end, server-side middleware represented by Geoserver software and PHP controllers, and JavaScript library for building typical components of web mapping client GUI developed using AJAX techniques. Huge multidimensional geospatial datasets are stored in a Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) and processed by a set of validated software modules included in the back-end. Results of a processing are represented by overlapped raster and vector layers placed over a georeferenced background. Data processing functionality allows performing basic and complex statistical analysis of climatological data whilst online geo-information system (GIS) instruments give a user an ability to combine and place georeferenced results over a chosen cartographical basis. It can provide specialists involved into multidisciplinary research projects, and even users without programming skills, with reliable and practical online instruments for integrated research of climate and ecosystems changes through a unified web-interface.	ajax (programming);cartography;computation;earth system science;ecosystem;geographic information system;graphical user interface;javascript library;middleware;netcdf;php;raster graphics;server (computing);server-side;software development;software framework;systems science;web mapping;while;world wide web	Igor Okladnikov;Evgeny Gordov;Alexander Titov;Tamara Shulgina	2015			computer science;data mining;database;world wide web	HPC	-39.47658593476066	-1.9457560234889744	194639
e2c4260bfdf066b7f66b33b09de4aab2894d8569	crmgeo: a spatiotemporal extension of cidoc-crm		CRMgeo is a formal ontology intended to be used as a global schema for integrating spatiotemporal properties of temporal entities and persistent items. Its primary purpose is to provide a schema consistent with the CIDOC CRM to integrate geoinformation using the conceptualizations, formal definitions, encoding standards and topological relations defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium in GeoSPARQL. To build the ontology, the same ontology engineering methodology was used as in the CIDOC CRM. CRMgeo first introduced the concept of Spacetime volume that was subsequently included in the CIDOC CRM and provides a differentiation between phenomenal and declarative Spacetime volume, Place and Time-Span. Phenomenal classes derive their identity from real world phenomena like events or things and declarative classes derive their identity from human declarations like dates or coordinates. This differentiation is an essential conceptual background to link CIDOC CRM to the classes, topological relations and encodings provided by Geo-SPARQL and thus allowing spatiotemporal analysis offered by geoinformation systems based on the semantic distinctions of the CIDOC CRM. CRMgeo introduces the classes and relations necessary to model the spatiotemporal properties of real world phenomena and their topological and semantic relations to spatiotemporal information about these phenomena that was derived from historic sources, maps, observations or measurements. It is able to model the full chain of approximating and finding again a phenomenal place, like the actual site of a ship wreck, by a declarative place, like a mark on a sea chart.	consortium;declarative programming;electronic logbook;entity;formal ontology;geo (microformat);geosparql;geographic information system;historical document;map;nautical chart;ontology engineering;sparql;span and div;spatial–temporal reasoning	Gerald Hiebel;Martin Doerr;Øyvind Eide	2016	International Journal on Digital Libraries	10.1007/s00799-016-0192-4	artificial intelligence;data mining;world wide web	DB	-36.31478759053233	-2.7407436665054448	195820

As the complexity of data centers or telecommunication networks increases, managing such infrastructures involves large amounts of data originating from many and diverse sources. In a typical IT management infrastructure, we find many management components such as commercial and open source products (e.g., for monitoring); custom, be-spoke software (e.g., a home-grown inventory database) as well as additional conventional (e.g., calendar) and unconventional (e.g., Web forums, blogs) data sources. The amount of information and the number of tools that are at the disposal of the system operator for management tasks are both wide-ranging and overwhelming. Finding the set of information and tools that is relevant to solve a given problem is a challenge, and typically requires expertise in how to extract data from the available data sources and how to use that extracted data effectively. A search facility that can locate data and tools is beneficial to systems management, but to maximize its impact, it needs to address the heterogeneity of data and data sources; provide task-focused, structured and enriched results, and be both scalable and cost-effective in the dynamic and changing environment of today's IT infrastructures. This paper describes such a system, called Fusio, that provides a search capability based on a loose coupling of heterogeneous, systems-management-related data in an IT environment. Fusio is based on the Semantic Web and traditional information-retrieval technologies. Tools such as Fusio are useful for system operators in carrying out tasks, such as problem resolution, where pointers to related information and tools can be quickly found to speed up the task. They are also useful for training purposes, e.g., as a reference to available data and tools. The paper describes the architecture of the search facility and the prototype implementation that is now being deployed in a test environment.	blog;data center;deployment environment;information retrieval;loose coupling;open-source software;prototype;scalability;semantic web;sysop;systems management;unconventional computing;web search engine	Metin Feridun;Axel Tanner	2010	2010 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium - NOMS 2010	10.1109/NOMS.2010.5488379	systems management;information technology management;computer science;operating system;data mining;database;world wide web;computer security;search engine	DB	-37.039539834156024	2.327395616733335	196557

Organization focuses on, for instance, resolving the syntactic and semantic heterogeneity of sensor data. The distinguishing factor between organization and interpretation is the abstraction from sensor data with information acquired from sensor data. Such information may be situational knowledge for environmental phenomena. We discuss a generic software framework for the organization and interpretation of sensor data and demonstrate its application to data of a large scale sensor network for the monitoring of atmospheric phenomena. The results show that software support for the organization and interpretation of sensor data is valuable to scientists in scientific computing workflows. Explicitly represented situational knowledge is also useful to client software systems as it can be queried, integrated, reasoned, visualized, or annotated. 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Unlike traditional fact-finding tasks that require only the typical single-query and response paradigm, these tasks involve a multistage search process in which bits of information are accumulated over a series of related queries. The ability and effectiveness of users to connect the dots between these pieces of information are crucial to enable discovery. In this paper, we introduce the notion of agglomerative querying for supporting """"search processes"""" and present its motivation, challenges and formalization. We focus on a specific class of agglomerative querying called association agglomerative querying which is very natural for linked data models such as RDF. We present a preliminary implementation approach for processing such queries and discuss its relationship with SPARQL query processing. Finally, we present empirical results for proving the effectiveness of our approach on the DBLP dataset and future directions."""	dbl-browser;data model;database;hierarchical clustering;linked data;multistage amplifier;programming paradigm;resource description framework;sparql;world wide web	Sidan Gao;Haizhou Fu;Kemafor Anyanwu	2010		10.1145/1859127.1859131	web query classification;computer science;linked data;data mining;database;rdf query language;web search query;world wide web;information retrieval	DB	-34.420753399871344	4.084596944053851	198298

Scientific workflows have become an important mechanism for scientists to combine scientific data management, analysis, simulation, and visualization tasks. However, most of the environments don't fully hide the complexity of the underlying orchestration language and middleware. What's more, almost all environments only provide a graphical editor but do nothing to offer a programmatic environment to scientists with the knowledge of the programming. In this paper, we introduce an improved scientific workflow environment called SWFVD to solve these problems by isolating visual representation from translation visual representation to business process execution language (BPEL). Meanwhile, we add some tool support for scientist to deal with BPEL to make the whole environment more convenient. The prototype of SWFVD based on China gird supporting platform (CGSP) is also given and examplesfrom chemistry are presented.	business process execution language;experiment;graphical user interface;middleware;prototype;simulation	Zhili Zhao;Ruisheng Zhang;Jiazao Lin;Ying Chen;Huajian Zhang;Lian Li	2008	2008 Seventh International Conference on Grid and Cooperative Computing	10.1109/GCC.2008.88	business process execution language;information science;computer science;data science;operating system;data mining;database;workflow technology	HPC	-40.83237825378303	-1.0596392320317227	198788
