1f67a0c94d0459da455febed511efbd6001717a5	the use of mobile phones to support children's literacy learning	mobile;phone;text;learning;sesame street;literacy;learning activities;text messaging;mobile phone;audio;children;parents;video	The goal of this study was to develop a mobile-phone based intervention that would encourage parents to engage their children in daily literacy-learning activities. The intervention content included text messages for parents, audio messages for parents and children, and Sesame Street letter videos for children. Messaging to parents suggested real-world activities that they could use to engage their children in learning letters. Pre- and post-interviews indicated a significant increase in the frequency with which parents reported engaging their children in literacy activities after participating in this study. In addition, 75% of lower-income participants and 50% of middle-income participants reported that they believed watching the Sesame Street letter videos helped their children learn letters. More than 75% of participants reported believing that a mobile phone used in this way can be an effective learning tool, since mobile-phone delivery made it extremely easy to incorporate literacy activities into their daily routines.	mobile phone	Glenda Revelle;Emily Reardon;Makeda Mays Green;Jeanette Betancourt;Jennifer Kotler	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-77006-0_31	video;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;multimedia;communication;literacy	HCI	-67.9160088216738	-40.31219985944248	184036

We have an assumption that the proposed method can be used in an experimental exercise class for training CS students targeted at mastering embedded software development skills. We focus on some technical issues confusing the students in an initial stage of the experiment and present a way for efficiently advising them by showing support information in accordance with the progress of an experimental task. The proposed method also supports multiple students cooperating to solve a single task by spatially projecting appropriate information in a working environment (a visualization technique called projection-based AR). We describe a prototype system designed and implemented based on the proposed method and discuss how the system can guide the students in some specific experimental exercises.	augmented reality;bus mastering;computer science;embedded software;prototype;sensor;software development;verification and validation	Toshiyuki Haramaki;Hiroaki Nishino	2016	2016 19th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems (NBiS)	10.1109/NBiS.2016.67	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;multimedia	Robotics	-67.46318030488864	-42.624736891934326	184542

This new paradigm improves the cooperation between students and teachers, overcoming the classroom borders. This paper proposes an ubiquitous testing system (UbiSysTest) for m- Learning environments. The goal of UbiSysTest is to provide an infrastructure for creating, storing, applying and correcting academic tests. Through UbiSysTest, students can download and execute these tests by means of cell phones. This application runs off-line and only connects through Internet whenever should be required. The UbiSysTest is being developed as part of an infrastructure named MoCoTo (Mobile Collaborative and Educational Tools).	application programming interface;artificial intelligence;authentication;download;internet;java community process;java platform, micro edition;mobile computing;mobile device;mobile phone;online and offline;personal digital assistant;programming paradigm;security and trust services api for j2me;tower mounted amplifier;transparent data encryption;usability;virtual machine;web service	Rafael Fernandes Lopes;Omar Andrés Carmona Cortes	2007	2007 Second International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications (ICSNC 2007)	10.1109/ICSNC.2007.20	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;mobile computing;ubiquitous computing	HCI	-69.3635582951202	-40.29666230231384	184885

This paper presents the approach used to define and evaluate parametric cognitive models that describe interaction and usage of ICT by people with aging- and disability-derived functional impairments. A multisensorial training platform was used to train, based on real user measurements in real conditions, the virtual parameterized user models that act as subjects of the test-bed during all stages of simulated disabilities-friendly ICT-based products design. An analytical study was carried out to identify the relevant cognitive functions involved, together with their corresponding parameters as related to aging- and disability-derived functional impairments. Evaluation of the final cognitive virtual user models in a real application has confirmed that the use of these models produce concrete valuable benefits to the design and testing process of accessible ICT-based applications and services. Parameterization of cognitive virtual user models allows incorporating cognitive and perceptual aspects during the design process.	bachelor of science in information technology;cognition disorders;cognitive model;testbed;benefit	Rebeca I.

Twelve experienced Macintosh users, faculty members of a university department, were interviewed in the study. The interviews focused on the strategies people use in customizing their personal computer resources according totheirspeciflc needs and individual preferences. It was found that many users have common problems, including structuring the file system and arranging convenient accessto files, managing project life-cycles, planning everyday activities, and integrating electronic documents with physical ones. A variety of individual approaches to these problems were revealed in the study. It is concluded that existing windowing systems provide limited support for higher-level users’ activities. The design implications of the findings are discussed.	personal computer	Victor Kaptelinin	1996		10.1145/238857.238921	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-63.362491624930875	-40.27766557470197	185528
b37e0bcffc6f61ae49bf91f77f6458a27a239545	exploring the influence of cultural diversity in collaborative design teams: preliminary findings		Past studies loosely define culturally heterogeneous group composition as any combination of mixed nationality and/or ethnicity. A case study with three project groups was conducted to investigate if culturally diverse groups composed differently in terms of nationality/ ethnicity mix will experience different types of communication problems. Communication problems of discussion dominance, reduced communication frequency and discussion exclusion were coded from taped discussions. Findings indicate that ethnicity and nationality give rise to different communication problems. Future studies should be specific when defining heterogeneous groups in terms of whether they are manipulating differences in nationality, ethnicity or both.

4b9a9513cb607043bb9f5e0ee942f92b7b61532b	classes for creating location-based audio tour content: a case of user-generated lbs education to university students		A course named Seminar of Culture Studies is given to undergraduate students in the School of Cultural and Creative Studies of Aoyama Gakuin University in Tokyo, Japan, in which a new mobile application named Manpo was applied for the students to create location-based audio tour content in 2013, 2014 and 2015. With little background knowledge on geography and cartography, the students tried to draw maps and create georeferences for positioning on the maps using Manpo’s functions. They also focused on recording audio guides for the POIs and walking routes, and bundled them to the maps together with photos and texts. The procedures of the classes and the students’ performances were observed, in which the problems encountered by the students showed the difficulties, such as achieving appropriate georeferencing for accurate positioning, for non-professional users. However, the classes and students provided hints to the further development of Manpo, which also improved the classes and the students’ works. As the course was proved to be a success, it inspired future research plans of a platform that can involve researchers, developers, mapmakers, local communities, and ordinary users to provide user-generated content including diverse maps for more attractive location-based services.	audio tour;location-based service;user-generated content	Min Lu;Masatoshi Arikawa;Atsuyuki Okabe	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-47289-8_19	library science;engineering;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-68.4062339944015	-41.33201952428686	186669

We focus on the Desktop, confirming results of previous studies as well as revealing new issues and ensuing design suggestions. While even basic competence users inventively appropriated the desktop, some features, in particular user-defined shortcuts, appeared counter-intuitive, and were underused. Users are still dissatisfied with their information organization and the challenge is to provide tools that support rather than replace the users 'flexible and creative use of the current desktop.	clutter;computer science;desktop computer;email;emergence;item unique identification;knowledge organization;ontology (information science);organizing (structure);personal computer;personal information management;software prototyping;usb decoration;usability testing;while	Akrivi Katifori;Giorgos Lepouras;Alan J.

Rapid advances in mobile computing and wireless communication present an opportunity for fundamental changes in engineering education, particularly for team based courses in which collaborative learning is the dominant learning mode. Through an iterative, bootstrapping approach, we study how students use computer-based collaboration tools to design a next generation of collaboration tools. Our suite of collaboration tools is called Handy Andy, which is based on the Andrew wireless network at Carnegie Mellon. Our goal is to facilitate computer-based collaborative learning in project-based design courses by developing collaboration tools for mobile computers.		Daniel P.

76c116b40f093f31e2b6a1862edd490bf08445c1	illustrating an intuitive and informative learning platform for third level education		Learning has become more ubiquitous due to the constant growth of the modern technologies. Students are constantly acquiring knowledge statically or on the go via their modern devices and internet. These students need flexible learning time in order to cope with their part-time work and their rapidly declining attention span. For some students, distance proves to be an obstacle to getting the education needed hence distant learning bridges the gap for them. It produces a better way to intuitively educate and seamlessly integrate social learning behaviour in an educational or social learning environment.	information	Olapeju Latifat Ayoola;Eleni E.

Many of the education-based applications are targeted toward the student as the end-user and trying to create a more effective educational environment using mobile technology. At our institution, we are investigating such applications, but wanted to look at tools focusing on the educator as well as the student. In this regard, we have developed and are testing a mobile productivity tool, SHERPA, for use by both the student and the instructor in the classroom. It is designed to assist the instructor in a number of administrative classroom activities and facilitate instructor-to-instructor communication. Student functionality includes the ability to interact with the instructor and other students, arrange collaborative meetings, and provide feedback on lectures. SHERPA is designed with a cloud computing architecture and attempts to leverage information sharing between instructors with common students. SHERPA was initially developed and tested in Fall semester 2010 with more extensive evaluation in the Spring 2011 semester. User feedback is very positive. This paper will describe SHERPA's functionality and design, its use in the classroom, instructor experience and feedback on the tool, and future plans.	cloud computing architecture;computer architecture;mobile app;mobile computing	Dino Schweitzer;Scott C.

In order to find out why it is so, We study in this paper what kind of game design makes game community formation and maintenance easier in Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG). Three MMORPGs are used as examples: Ultima Online, Anarchy Online and Toontown Online. The communication methods, game mechanics and environments of the three MMORPGs are compared and their effects on the game community are analyzed. Communities do not exist without communication. Game mechanics affects how important it is for the players to co-operate and compete with others and how useful it is to form different kinds of sub-communities, such as guilds. If the game supports player created content it typically strengthens the game community. The game environment provides settings for player-to-player interaction and can encourage collaboration and inspire the players to create their own stories around the sub-communities.	ambient occlusion;anarchy;game mechanics;massively multiplayer online role-playing game;newbie;online chat;proof of existence;ultima online;video game design;virtual community	Elina M.

e1bda80baa845801a61fd99be0391916791191b4	wearable learning: multiplayer embodied games for math		We present a new technology-based paradigm to support embodied mathematics educational games, using wearable devices in the form of SmartPhones and SmartWatches for math learning, for full classes of students in formal in-school education settings. The Wearable Learning Games Engine is web based infrastructure that enables students to carry one mobile device per child, as they embark on math team-based activities that require physical engagement with the environment. These Wearable Tutors serve as guides and assistants while students manipulate, measure, estimate, discern, discard and find mathematical objects that satisfy specified constraints. Multi-player math games that use this infrastructure have yielded both cognitive and affective benefits. Beyond math game play, the Wearable Games Engine Authoring Tool enables students to create games themselves for other students to play; in this process, students engage in computational thinking and learn about finite-state machines. We present the infrastructure, games, and results for a series of experiments on both game play and game creation.	computation;computational thinking;experiment;finite-state machine;mobile device;programming paradigm;smartphone;smartwatch;unreal development kit;wearable computer;wearable technology	Ivon Arroyo;Matthew Micciolo;Jonathan Casano;Erin Ottmar;Taylyn Hulse;Ma.

However, when performed adequately, it is fundamental for both child and professionals development, allowing a sound basis for reflection and action around learning experiences and teaching environments. Following specific guidelines and programs can help the teachers reduce inherent subjectivity. The EEL/DQP was developed to evaluate and improve quality in preschool education. This program is enhanced by using a rigorous observation process of children and adults. In this paper we propose an unified data model to structure the information from the thirteen steps of the EEL/DQP. Moreover, we also describe a smartphone application to assist the observer, recording notes, sound, photos and video.	data model;eel;experience;experiment;intentionality;mobile app;smartphone;social network;tree structure	Cristina Mesquita;Rui Pedro Lopes	2014		10.5220/0004837701310138	psychology;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;communication;world wide web;observational study	HCI	-66.81453405077774	-44.090194285314105	191483

Likewise, technology allows for the generation of new content formats every day – letting us write text and convert it automatically into voice, web, PDF or DVD. This article proposes detailed monitoring of the browsing logs of a number of students using a mobile device (iPad) in order to better understand students’ habits. The study is based on a comparison of browsing habits on PCs and mobile devices, and includes contextual observation fieldwork. Thus, the study combines both quantitative and qualitative data. Results obtained using this methodology will provide us with better insight of user navigational behaviour with respect to the used devices.	browsing;field research;mobile device;portable document format;ipad	Magí Almirall Hill;Julià Minguillón	2012			simulation;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-67.4886445393402	-41.45935225977863	193353

It explores the extent to which such games enhance the language learning experience of advanced level EFL learners. The author draws on his work developing Mission not really Impossible, a location-based augmented reality game which uses the Aurasma mobile application to provide a series of challenging language tasks for advanced level learners as they move around the city of Karlsruhe in Germany. The game is evaluated through a mix of observation during gameplay and feedback from participants. Broad approval of the language challenges that had to be completed is evident and Aurasma proves itself to be user-friendly and reliable. The findings affirm the potential of augmented reality games to engage and challenge advanced level language learners.

We propose a novel visualization technique that combines several representations to show the daily patterns of team members’ activities. It uses a 24 hours circular display to facilitate international collaboration across time zones. Current calendar information can be compared to the typical patterns and reveal likely availability. User studies evaluating the tool that implements the proposed technique are reported and discussed.

These roles were derived through analysis of a representative sample of ARGs and two case studies of small scale, education-based ARGs. In particular, we found that the approach that designers take to incorporate in-game protagonists (""""protagonist-by-proxies"""" and """"protagonist-mentors"""") can influence the ways in which 1) players gain access to the disparate narrative and ludic elements within an ARG and 2) designers can integrate collaborative learning opportunities authentically into the narrative and gameplay."""	alternate reality: the dungeon;alternate reality game;biological anthropology;experiment;ibm notes;keystone effect;librarian;ludic interface;mixed reality;peer-to-peer;virtual world	Elizabeth Bonsignore;Derek L.

(a CMU spin-off company) and colleagues in Shell Exploration and Production UK (EXPRO) to develop a Wearable Operator's Assistant (WOA) for workers on offshore oil rigs. The assistant is a handheld or wearable computer for technicians to perform daily operations and maintenance tasks on oil rigs under construction in Scotland, and after installation in the North Sea. The WOA project was charted to """"empower the technician"""" making them """"a Supertech, the envy of other technicians"""". This meant offering all resources currently available on paper (forms to do inspections and report problems, job cards, maintenance manuals, equipment histories, notebooks, etc.) through a digital interface, accessible from anywhere, anytime on the platform. A user-centered design approach and scenarios were widely used in the development process and were a successful means for presenting and evaluating ideas. This design process used two additional methods: the integration of flowcharts with the scenarios, and the extensive involvement of the end users throughout the course of the project. A high acceptance rate of the system and positive feedback from the technicians is partly attributed to this design approach.

8ef7e7de445efbb854c98cfd48a2dbded54b8e4f	an edutainment approach to academic teaching based on storytelling	2001 communication and media studies	In this paper, we describe an approach to academic teaching in computer science using storytelling as a means to investigate to hypermedia and virtual reality topics. Indications are shown that narrative activity within the context of a Hypermedia Novel related to educational content can enhance motivation for selfconducted learning and in parallel lead to an edutainment system of its own. In contrast to existing approaches the Hypermedia Novel environment allows an iterative approach to the narrative content, thereby integrating story authoring and story reception not only in the beginning but at any time. The narrative practice and background research as well as the resulting product can supplement lecture material with comparable success to traditional academic teaching approaches. On top of this there is the added value of soft skill training and a gain of expert knowledge in areas of personal background research.	computer science;educational entertainment;hypermedia;in the beginning... was the command line;iteration;virtual reality	Wolfgang Heiden;Eric Fassbender	2010			human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;communication	HCI	-68.29806522325399	-38.14299180057218	197281

The rapid growth of wireless and mobile technologies results in a huge demand on qualified professionals in this area. More and more schools started teaching wireless and mobile networking, but how to provide students with hands-on practice experience is still a challenge. The networking capabilities of smart mobile devices make it a perfect instructional tool for networking related course teaching. In this study, we have designed and developed a labware with Android smart phones that focuses on teaching and learning of fundamental data communications and networking concepts by making use of the mobile nature of smart phones and mobile devices. The goal of this labware is to provide students with hands-on experience with mobile devices to better understand networking concepts such as different layers of TCP/IP protocol, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and a wide range of networking methodologies/implementations in a easy-adoptable, affordable, and effective way.

f6d930caed39c1652326b7fe9b7ffecbb6da36f5	graphicuss - temporal visualisation of canvas creation processes		The use of graphical models to describe complex topics is very common in teaching, helping students build an adequate model of knowledge presented. Often, students discuss open questions on-line in forums. Backtracking of errors conducted during the creation process is hard. The individual steps of developing a solution – the temporal information – are lost. Graphicuss combines concepts of textual discussion systems and graphical feedback systems. It fosters better discussions and comprehension through access to the temporal information of canvases. Especially self-regulated learning benefits from the addition of temporal information; students’ skill acquisition capabilities are amplified. Yet, an intuitive representation of temporal information is still required. Based on image and video processing, we investigated existing metaphors for temporal information. A series of user studies emphasises the differences of the metaphors in varying use-cases and strongly points at a candidate suitable and feasible for PCs as well as mobile devices.	backtracking;computer science;diagram;display size;graphical model;graphical user interface;line level;list comprehension;mobile device;mock object;online and offline;paper prototyping;personal computer;prototype;smartphone;unified modeling language;video processing	Tenshi Hara;Anastasia Iljassova;Iris Braun;Felix Kapp	2018		10.5220/0006680901990204	multimedia;computer science;visualization	HCI	-66.90931690763959	-41.8175412710438	199398

This online experiment examined the effects of three commonly employed game design elements -- points, leaderboard, levels -- on users' performance, intrinsic motivation, perceived autonomy and competence in an image annotation task. Implementation of these game elements significantly increased performance, but did not affect perceived autonomy, competence or intrinsic motivation. Our findings suggest that points, levels and leaderboards by themselves neither make nor break users' intrinsic motivation in non-game contexts. Instead, it is assumed that they act as progress indicators, guiding and enhancing user performance. While more research on the contextual factors that may potentially mediate the effects of game elements on intrinsic motivation is required, it seems that the implementation of points, levels, and leaderboards is a viable means to promote specific user behavior in non-game contexts.	automatic image annotation;autonomy;gamification;progress indicator;video game design	Elisa D.
