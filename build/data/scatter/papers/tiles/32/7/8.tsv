221bc2dd035cbffc4bcd0a0cf004e4c28503560f	one piece at a time: why video-based communication is better for negotiation and conflict resolution	collaborative work;task difficulty;communication strategy;video conferencing;information exchange;computer mediated communication;communication technology;conflict resolution;negotiation	We compared the effects of three computer mediated communication (CMC) channels (text, audio, and video) on how people performed an appointment-scheduling task. The task involved a grounding and a conflict resolution component. The results showed that video conferencing supported participant dyads in reaching a consensus that had better balanced performance between the dyads only when task difficulty was high and when there were more inherent conflicts in the task. Participants across the three CMC conditions also demonstrated different patterns of conversation dynamics during information exchange and negotiation. Mediation analysis showed that in video-based communication, strategies of exchanging less information at a time predicted higher levels of negotiation, which in turn predicted smaller performance differences in high conflict conditions. The results suggested that the design and use of communication technologies for remote conflict resolution should promote the strategy of exchanging information in small pieces, which could better support subsequent negotiation and foster a sense of fairness.	computer-mediated communication;fairness measure;information exchange;scheduling (computing)	Wei Dong;Wai-Tat Fu	2012		10.1145/2145204.2145232	information and communications technology;simulation;information exchange;telecommunications;computer science;conflict resolution;sociology;videoconferencing;communication;social psychology;negotiation;computer-mediated communication	HCI	-69.06569109736044	-46.961832179662615	183927

This occurs because the organizational culture of the parent organization purports to promote participation, or because structured design methods are being used which require users to play a part. In either case users who ® nd themselves required to participate in IT projects are frequently unclear about what this requires. In most organizations surprisingly little brie® ng on the users’ role in design projects is provided. Users are therefore confused about their brief and concerned about their lack of expertise in computing. Although research reports on participatory design (PD) projects abound, little coherent guidance for the key stakeholders representing users’ interests is available. The contents of this paper go some way towards ® lling the gap. Clear differentiation is made in the paper between the roles of the different players involved. Detailed guidance is provided for meeting the varied requirements of the different roles. For example, the roles of `top’ management and `middle’ management in supporting user involvement are explored, their special responsibilities speci ® ed and required actions listed. The need for an infrastructure to support user involvement and how to create one is discussed. Guidance is provided on, for example, the representation process and the factors to consider in selecting user representatives. The role of user representatives is particularly problematical and therefore receives particularly close attention. Finally guidance is given regarding the common pitfalls in Quality Assurance procedures and especially how to avoid the procedures becoming a meaningless `rubber-stamping’ exercise. The guidance presented is grounded in the extensive experience of the author in participative design processes in a wide variety of contexts including the footwear industry, a major UK government department and a telecommunications and broadcasting company.	coherence (physics);requirement;software quality assurance;structured analysis;systems design	Leela Damodaran	1996	Behaviour & IT	10.1080/014492996120049	quality assurance;user;organizational culture;simulation;design process;human–computer interaction;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;user requirements document;management;social psychology;information technology;world wide web;systems design;mechanical engineering	HCI	-63.427146269543975	-47.876980191626345	184145

The station combines a physical platform allowing children with CP to provide pedaling input into a game, a standard Xbox 360 controller, and algorithms for interpreting the cycling input to improve smoothness and accuracy of gameplay. The station was designed through an iterative and incremental participatory design process involving medical professionals, game designers, computer scientists, kinesiologists, physical therapists, and eight children with CP. It has been tested through observation of its use, through gathering opinions from the children, and through small experimental studies. With our initial design, only three of eight children were capable of playing a cycling-based game; with the final design, seven of eight could cycle effectively, and six reached energy expenditure levels recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine while pedaling unassisted.	algorithm;computer scientist;iteration;iterative and incremental development;kinesiology;xbox 360 controller	Hamilton A.

In this approach, users perform tasks that address the specific issues of concern. Use of the feature in isolation is assumed to provide results that would be valid if the features were used in the context of all other features. The present poster evaluates this assumption and describes the importance of an integrated approach to testing. We suggest that usability testers should construct test scenarios that require integration across different system features to obtain an accurate evaluation of the product and the individual features.	software testing;usability testing;user interface	Alice Y.

642946e4aacb432cfba1f15eedec6933507d2b21	extending an association map to handle large data sets		This paper presents the Association Map-Large (AM-L), an interactive visualization of entity associations. AM-L is an extension of a previously reported AM interface that has been enhanced with search and interaction features for supporting larger data sets. We report on a user study with thirty two participants, which assesses user performance and experience with AM-L versus a tabular representation of the same data in the context of an enterprise system. Participants with varying levels of experience were given both simple and complicated tasks to complete with each system. Results indicate greater enjoyment and lower levels of mental effort when using AM-L, as well as less time spent on average when performing tasks. Accuracy results in terms of correctness indicate a learning curve, with overall performance worse with AM-L on the first two simple questions and first complex question, but then as well or better on subsequent questions. Given that the AM-L interface is unlike any with which the users had prior experience, it is not surprising that some exposure to the interface, such as training, would be helpful prior to use. Suggestions from the participants will inform future enhancements to the interface, which will be validated with further studies.		Tamara Babaian;Wendy T. Lucas;Alina M.

Students interview the ECA to diagnose his diseases as a doctor would do in a real situation. This virtual patient can communicate using natural language and express different moods that depend on the diseases he suffers from and the studentpsilas behavior. The ECApsilas behavior is done by means of the coordination of several modules devoted to different tasks: natural language understanding, dialogue management, emotional state control and natural language generation. An ontology that gathers the domain knowledge of the agent specifies a semantic language that the modules use to communicate themselves. The system has two kinds of advantages. First, it offers a way to put in practice the theoretical knowledge acquired by the students in their degree courses and to improve the diagnostic and communicative skills decreasing the learning curve of these abilities, setting them for an interview process like the one they are going to face in their real job. Second, the system is ready to use at any time without needing special or expensive equipment, only a standard PC.	anaphora (linguistics);control unit;dialog system;embodied agent;embodied cognition;flash animation;graphical user interface;intelligent agent;natural language generation;natural language understanding;personal computer;team foundation server	Víctor López;Eduardo M.

471ee5fe4f7af9dc0a7642226c06fbb7f71f26c7	training software engineers in a novel usability evaluation technique	usability evaluation;cognitive theory;interface design;software engineering;design technique;design;user model	Novel approaches to designing or analysing systems only become useful when they are usable by practitioners in the fi eld, and not just by their originators. Design techniques often fail to make the transition from research to practice because insufficient attention is paid to understanding and communicating the skills required to use them. This paper reports on work to train software engineering students to use a user-centred language for describing and analysing interface designs called the “Programmable User Model Instruction Language”, or IL. Various types of data, including video, students’ IL descriptions and brief usability reports were collected during training, and subsequently analysed. These s ow that after 6 hours’ training, students have a good grasp of the syntax of the notation, and are starting to use notational affordances to support their reasoning, but that their reasoning is still limited by a poor grasp of the underlying cognitive theory. A comparison of the analyses of trainees with those of experts provides a means of developing a better understanding of the nature of expertise in this area — as comprising an understanding of the syntax and the surface semantics of the notation, the underlying cognitive theory, the method of conducting an analysis and the implications of the analysis for design.	cognitive science;computer science;microsoft windows;report;software engineer;usability	Ann Blandford;Simon Buckingham Shum;Richard M.

9c23ddcbf167a5131d853325f667d9a372783802	coasd: a tabletop game to support the collaborative work of users with autism spectrum disorder		This paper presents the design and evaluation of CoASD (Collaborative Game for people with Autism Spectrum Disorder). CoASD is a game designed to offer support for collaborative work for users with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Individuals with ASD have impairments in social communication and behavioral areas, presenting difficulty to perceive, interact, communicate and share with others. CoASD Game has been projected with specific characteristics to support the performance of the required collaborative tasks, as well as to encourage the collaborative work of ASD users with higher difficulties in the affected areas. The game has been assessed upon a group of seven boys with high degrees of impairment. The results have shown that CoASD Game favorably contributes to draw the attention of users to perceive and perform the tasks, motivating them to act and collaborate with their partners.	interaction	Greis Francy M.

To carry out an operation successfully, intense training for complex collaborative tasks needs to be provided for all team members. In our study we applied a virtual training environment to train police personnel for complex collaborative tasks. The virtual training group was compared to a group with standard training and to a control group. The data show that the standard training resulted in more motivation, perceived value of the training and knowledge after the training session than virtual training. But with regard to the learning transfer measured by the behaviour in a real and complex situation, the virtual training was as good as the standard training. Both outperformed the control group. 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We conducted a between-subjects experiment with individuals in 30 teams. Results showed that team potency was a strong predictor of individual performance of robot operators, but the impact was moderated by team ethnic diversity. Team potency increased performance in ethnically diverse teams but had no impact on performance in ethnically homogeneous teams. Surprisingly, team potency also decreased viability in ethnically diverse teams. These results have several theoretical and practical implications for the literature on team potency in technology-supported teams.	dyadic transformation;kerrison predictor;robot	Sangseok You;Teng Ye;Lionel Peter Robert	2017			information system;cultural diversity;knowledge management;computer science;computer-supported cooperative work;robot;human–robot interaction;team diversity;potency;embodied cognition	HCI	-69.28216582774209	-47.547101102167474	195016

Many factors can complicate estimating and planning the documentation an API requires. Even when an API's documentation requirements can be estimated, it can be difficult to present to stakeholders an objective basis for the estimate. The cognitive dimensions of API usability have characterized APIs and their users successfully and they have been used to communicate these characterizations to stakeholders. It follows that the same dimensions could also help identify the documentation that an API requires to provide a satisfactory and successful experience for the software developers who use the API.	application programming interface;cognitive dimensions of notations;documentation;requirement;software developer;usability	Robert Watson	2014		10.1145/2666216.2666239	look and feel;application programming interface;computer science;operating system;database;software documentation;world wide web	HCI	-63.14144599999332	-46.378058359002345	197945

This is particularly true in the field of games research where no rigorous comparative validation has yet been published. In order to validate the available heuristics, a user test of a commercial game is conducted with 6 participants in which 88 issues are identified, against which 146 heuristics are rated for relevance by 3 evaluators. Weak inter-rater reliability is calculated with Krippendorff's Alpha of 0.343, refuting validation of any of the available heuristics. This weak reliability is due to the high complexity of video games, resulting in evaluators interpreting different reasonable causes and solutions for the issues, and hence the wide variance in their ratings of the heuristics.	heuristic (computer science);heuristic evaluation;inter-rater reliability;relevance;usability	Gareth R.

Ubiquitous learning as one application of ubiquitous computing is playing a very important role in our daily life. Training is a kind of learning in ubiquitous environment. During the whole training process, the performance of a learner in a series of units may change with patterns: progress, plateau, and decline. Therefore, it is necessary to apply different support strategies to adapt to different states of the learner. In the previous work, a mutual adaptive support based on one learner model was proposed. However one learner model may sometime make the learner lose his/her motivation easily, since each learner does the training independently. There is a need to propose support for group training which is used to let learners do training and improve themselves together. But in the current models for group training, most of them focus on cooperative and competitive training but ignore balance feeling of connection and burden of learners. Feeling of connection is very important in group training since it can give learners continuing motivation by exchanging information. However it also may bring burden to learners due to frequency, volume and content of exchanged information. So an effective mechanism is needed to balance the feeling of burden and connection of multiple learners. To this end, we propose a new support method for a pair of learners to solve the problem. In this paper, firstly, we calculate how much a learner affects the other learner. Then we design an algorithm to judge the feeling of connection and burden from the other leaner. Finally, due to different feeling of connection and burden, various support strategies are designed to support learners. We have implemented our support method in a typing game and shown the method can balance the feeling of connection and burden.	algorithm;look and feel;ubiquitous computing	Yueting Li;Junbo Wang;Lei Jing;Zixue Cheng;Hiroshi Oki;Xianzhi Ye	2011	2011 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems	10.1109/CISIS.2011.23	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia	HCI	-69.758262105924	-45.55955367165097	199802
