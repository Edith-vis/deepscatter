Critical ancestral computing—socio-cultural and historical ecosystem approaches to solve complex problems—as an epistemological center for computer science education opens a pathway of critical consciousness, academic success and cultural relevance (Ladson-Billings, 2009). Weaving both disciplines to build a tapestry of critical ancestral computing in urban computer science education sets a stage for social transformation of present-day colonialism (Orelus, 2012). Critical ancestral computing feeds 1) a socio-historical learning context, 2) positive cultural academic identity formations, and 3) advocacy approaches that link engagement with society as individual and collective action by interrupting neocolonialism and prioritizing the health of social and environmental well-being.	computer science;ecosystem;gene regulatory network;interrupt;neocolonialism;relevance	Cueponcaxochitl Dianna Moreno Sandoval	2013	PsychNology Journal		psychology;social science;computer science;artificial intelligence;mechanical engineering	Theory	-68.13281516204687	-32.361476913188746	177549

Little is known about how the two groups interact online around works of fiction, using either specialist social reading platforms e.g. GoodReads or Wattpad, or popular social media tools like Twitter. A better understanding of the interplay between them and the role technology plays as mediator can help inform the development of next-generation tools to suit their needs. We describe findings from interviews conducted with genre fiction authors and readers about how and why they interact and share information online. Interviews revealed that the social dynamics between the groups are complex, and that intercommunication can be both limited and somewhat unwanted. This shifted our focus from identifying how they interact to understanding why they do not. We found that communication patterns established by the traditional publishing industry create barriers between the groups, made visible, and exacerbated, by their retrofit to online social platforms where readers and authors are treated as equal. We discuss our key findings and highlight opportunities to better support the incongruent information needs of the groups.	information needs;matchware mediator;social dynamics;social media	Carol Butler	2018		10.1145/3176349.3176359	knowledge management;data mining;computer science;information needs;publishing;mediation (marxist theory and media studies);social media;social dynamics	HCI	-66.53118392102789	-31.14201050936498	177687

We propose a set of concepts and related questions for analyzing and deliberating these issues on the basis of participants' own experiences in PD projects. The conceptual framework we propose has been inspired by Schön's notion of 'design moves' and by Alfred Schütz' concept of choice. The PD experiences of workshop participants will be explored collaboratively with the aim of arriving at a deeper and more specific understanding of what the users participate in and how they can recognize their influence in the design result.	experience	Tone Bratteteig;Ina Wagner	2014		10.1145/2662155.2662203	education;social science;human–computer interaction;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;management science;sociology;management	HCI	-63.75657633764514	-33.764029394038296	177879

This contribution will focus on dyadic cognitive and triadic semiotic perspectives on the issue of interpretation and construction of shared representations. We propose a typology of external representations as a basis for further study of shared representations. As illustrated by examples from an existing corpus, the framework allows describing co-occurrence and superimpositions of different types, as well as transitions from one type to another. In the final section, we anticipate the exploitation of the framework in the light of the design of collaborative systems. & 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The model has helped each of us to account for gaps between intended and enacted sequences in relation to these artifacts. In particular, instrumental genesis provides a mechanism for differentiating between the designer’s arc of intentionality and the student’s learning trajectory, two vectors that may be tacitly aligned for historically evolved learning materials but at variance for recently created materials. Characteristic of our case studies—a networked-classroom design for functions and a mixed-media design for probability—are breakdowns in which students’ behavior deviated either from the designer’s intention or from classic models of constructivist design. In both cases, the breakdowns were valuable in that they occasioned refinement of our theories and designs. Introduction A common and perhaps defining characteristic of design-based research is that the designs under investigation are raw, embryonic, or in flux—they are visions not yet fully realized, guided by principles still seeking clearer articulation, and enacted through tools in need of refinement. This incomplete state of the designs, especially in their early iterations, necessarily reflects the developing nature of the theories of learning-in-relationto-design they seek to inform. We take the inevitable rawness and fluidity of our under-development designs as useful affordances of this empirical genre; in the cases presented below, we describe irregular aspects of our designs that have contributed to the refinement of theory as much as—and perhaps more than—normative features would. However, irregularities of a design can pose distinctive methodological challenges for the design researcher, particularly in the analysis of data from instances in which implementation revealed departures from an intended or canonical design. As to-be-expected features of emergent designs, such departures warrant neither the outright rejection of a hypothesis nor the immediate abandonment of a designed artifact. Rather, we posit, they may occasion the emergence of new instructional or theoretical constructs, and mark pivotal opportunities for reexamining the enfolding dynamics between theory and design in relation to the artifacts we study. This paper seeks to integrate lessons from two quite different design studies into a common set of analytic tools for examining data episodes diagnosed as aberrant in relation to designed learning artifacts. In particular, our respective research studies have required us to interpret instances of temporary divergence of students’ experiences from the designer’s intention, whether this intention was a priori explicit or post facto emergent. We treat these breakdowns—in communication, in understanding, in implementation of a design—as opportunities to consider complexities inherent to learning with artifacts.(2) As researchers with both theoretical and engineering focus on artifacts that support learning, we typically scrutinize students’ engagement with artifacts with an eye on whether, how, why, and at what point students are able to recognize the affordances of these available artifacts for the successful accomplishment of the mandated problem-solving activities. In the cases we discuss below, students were initially unable to instrumentalize an artifact in line with the designer’s intentionality, either because the nature of the problem was temporarily obscured from the student or because the artifact functioned counter to the designer’s intention. Based on our analyses of these cases, we have come to believe that these designer–student breakdowns with respect to the objective and nature of instrumentalization may be quite common to design-based research studies, and that this ubiquity constitutes an empirical resource for advancing particular designs as well as design theory and learning theory. That is, the breakdowns do not necessarily reflect on the integrity of the underlying design rationale, and students’ experiences may ultimately be beneficial, yet the breakdowns give us pause to reflect on students’ dispositions and resourcefulness in relation to the tacit contract underlying productive engagement in designed learning activities. Building on Vérillon and Rabardel’s (1995) theory of instrumental genesis, we propose an approach to examining breakdown—an approach that hinges on analytically separating the structural/functional To appear in G.

This element of the research aimed to gather information regarding pupil views of IWBs and the impact these tools can have on teaching and learning. To extend current literature the method targeted pupils’ views of how IWB can impact on metacognition: thinking about learning. Using a tem plate that has been developed by the team at Newcastle University children were enco uraged to talk about learning in different contexts: this methodology and its ration ale are described. The results show that overall comments from the pupils are positive, with the resulting themes encompassing how the IWB can facilitate and initiat e learning and impact on preferred approaches to learning. The pupils descri be how different elements of software and hardware can motivate, aid concentrati on and keep their attention. On the negative side, pupils candidly describe their f rustration when there are technical difficulties, their desire to use the board themsel ves and their perceptions of teacher and pupil affects. We discuss implications and make recommendations for the teacher and manufacturers.

Communication in an inclusive design workshop is not intercultural collaboration itself. However, as designers, engineers, and users who have individual needs, such as aged and disabled people, gather in the workshop, participants may become aware of differences in individual creation of meanings by communicating with other participants. Because as individuals our imaginative power is sometimes quite insufficient, it is not possible to sufficiently analyze such individual needs without communicating directly. In the inclusive design workshop, participants cooperate with each other during the design process, revealing differences in individual creation of meanings. In this paper, we describe some activities of social-academic cooperation, specifically cases of workshops that were run by an nonprofit organization (NPO) and a laboratory at Kyoto University. The former supports aged and disabled people's participation in society and the latter researches communication by the system theory.	optimization problem	Takayuki Shiose;Kentaro Toda;Hiroshi Kawakami;Osamu Katai	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74000-1_27	engineering;knowledge management;management science;management	HCI	-64.96893472426045	-36.648236419300694	180018

However, inequality in online communication is just as common as in other social contexts. To research the effects of starting from the presupposition of inequality we have developed a groupware for discussions. Based on democratic meeting techniques and social media it takes the form of a strategic game. The score within the game reflect user activity and the reactions to the activity in a dynamic way. The calculation and weighing mechanisms are open to inspection and change by the users. Hierarchical roles reflecting game levels may be attached to rights of what a specific user may change.

This perspective extends recent debates about protostory [1] elements, processes, and specific micro-structures unique to and possibly shared [2] across these forms.

c31650b2ec82c88c4e6070b585852c2933122467	intui. exploring the facets of intuitive interaction	talk	The growing interest in intuitive interaction in research and product design comes along with a demand for according measurement tools. The present research introduces a novel questionnaire which captures different components of intuitive interaction, in particular, Effortlessness, Gut Feeling, Magical Experience and Verbalizability. Components and the respective questionnaire items were developed based on literature review and an expert workshop, and then tested for reliability and validity in three empirical studies with a total of 334 participants. In all three studies a stable four factor structure representing the four components emerged. Analysis of correlations to further measures provided a deeper understanding of the concept. Finally, product category specific patterns of the relative specification of the components could be identified. Altogether, the presented questionnaire forms an easy applicable tool for practitioners and researchers. 1 Introducing the concept of Intuitive Interaction Product designers are facing new challenges over and over again: after the claim for usability, which was even manifested in an ISO norm (DIN EN ISO 9241-11 1998), it was remarked that products should be even more than usable (e.g., Burmester et al. 2002), and the term usability was integrated in the more holistic term user experience (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky 2006). Finally, the latest buzzword among researchers and vendors is intuitive interaction 1 : Many companies promote their products as being more intuitive than ever, for example, Adobe announced to improve its products by “making the most powerful editing techniques more intuitive“ (Adobe System 2010). And when presenting the new iPad at the Apple Keynote in San Francisco, Steve Jobs claimed that “this new category of devices will connect users with their apps and content in a much more intimate, intuitive and fun way than ever before.” (Apple Inc 2010). Accordingly, there is also a growing interest in the role of intuition in usability testing and evaluation (e.g., Meyer & Kindsmüller 2009). However, it is still unclear how a product’s intuitiveness can or should be assessed. In this paper, we 1 We use the terms intuitive interaction and intuitive use interchangeably, both stand for interaction styles which are perceived as highly intuitive. Accordingly, intuitiveness is not regarded as an existing product feature but as the subjectively perceived degree to which a product is being usable in an intuitive manner. INTUI. Exploring the Facets of Intuitive Interaction. 2 present a novel questionnaire which is based on a multidimensional concept of intuition, and thus captures different facets of intuitive interaction. When starting our research it quickly became clear that rating a product’s degree of intuitiveness would be a challenging undertaking, at least in the sense of objective assessment: What is intuitive for one person might appear absurd for the other. The question whether something appears intuitive depends on the congruence to one’s personal prior experience, so that a new “objectively” intuitive concept might not be perceived as such when it deviates too much from the familiar concept. For example, this was revealed when Microsoft introduced the new ribbon interface in the Office 2007 Suite. Though it was supposed to be the “intuitive counterpoint to the typical standard Windows menu system” (Microsoft 2010) some users were sceptical about its advantages and hesitated to switch from the familiar menu-structure to the foreign ribbon structure, and declared the latter as “a disaster“, “shockingly painful to use” and “definitely not intuitive” (Kyd 2007). The grouping of similar commands and the expanded overview of available functions certainly allows an easy entry for novice users, but at least for some of the expert users, the convincing simplicity of the new concept could not outweigh the loss of their familiar menu structure. However, this dependence of perceived intuitiveness on prior experience is not only an obstacle but also a chance to design for intuitive interaction. Luckily there are also shared cultural experiences which thus can be used as a basis for the design of operating concepts (e.g., Hurtienne & Israel 2007). Accordingly, the reference to prior experience is central to most suggested definitions which describe intuitive use as the unconscious utilization of knowledge acquired through past experiences (e.g., Blackler 2008; Naumann et al. 2009). However, speaking of intuitive use and not simply of the application of knowledge, there remains the question how much these past experiences must differ from the actual use case. Moreover, Naumann and colleagues (2009) point out that intuitive use results in efficient interaction, and accordingly focus in their questionnaire on intuitive use on performance related issues such as “perceived goal achievement“, “error rate“, and “learning“. In our view, intuitive interaction is not a solely pragmatic issue. Other than classical usability criteria, which may be surveyed in form of “checklists” such as the ISO norm questionnaire (Prümper 1997), it requires a holistic approach which respects its complexity. Instead of limiting our scope, we were rather interested in indentifying the different facets that constitute the overall experience of intuitive interaction. Thus, our research goal was to first identify the central components of intuitiveness by literature research and interviews, and then map these onto questionnaire scales. To broaden our scope, we did not only include HCI literature on intuitive interaction but also psychological literature on intuitive decision making. Here, the following central aspects of intuitive decision making were identified:  Intuition is a process that is usually fast and without the need of effort (e.g., Agor 1986, Bastick 2003, Hammond 1996, Hogarth 2001).  Intuition is usually an unconscious process (e.g., Agor 1986; Bastick 2003; Fischbein 1987; Hammond 1996).

Exploring the Facets of Intuitive Interaction. 3  Intuitive decisions are based on gut feelings rather than reason (Gigerenzer 2007; Hammond 1996; Hogarth 2001).  Intuition leads us to decisions which cannot necessarily been explained (e.g., Agor 1986; Bastick 2003; Fischbein 1987; Hogarth 2001). Based on these finding we formulated labels to capture each of these prominent characteristics of intuitive decision making. In particular, these were Effortlessness, Attention, Gut Feeling, and Verbalizability. Concerning the last one, Verbalizability, we are not certain whether something that applies to decision making – intuitive decisions are characterized by a low degree of verbalizability – can be applied to intuitive interaction as well. However, we still wanted to include this component in our questionnaire to find out whether any correlations to the other components or overall ratings could be revealed. In addition to these four components derived from the literature on intuitive decision making, we believed that there should be an additional component, capturing the experiential characteristics of intuitive interaction compared to “normal” interaction. Here, our idea was that the event of using technology in a particularly affect-based, effortless manner, exceeding the user’s expectations, might also be experienced as something special or even magical. Thus, we added Magical Experience as fifth component. We therefore began our research with a model of five components. 2 Questionnaire Construction Based on the components of intuition which we identified in our literature review, an initial set of items was constructed in a workshop with fifteen participants. At first, they were asked to name characteristics of intuitive interaction based on their daily experience. In order to make sure that participants reported their spontaneous ideas and did not narrow down their thoughts, this brainstorming was conducted before the concepts from intuitive decision making were introduced. However no entirely new component could be identified. After this, statements capturing the experience of (non-)intuitive product interaction were gathered for each of the five components among five usability experts of the authors' working group. They were encouraged to think of as many statements as possible, these were noted without any discussion or critique. In this manner, altogether about fifty statements were gathered. For example, the statement “While using the product I was guided by feelings.” related to Gut Feeling, “Using this product was easy” related to Effortlessness. In the following phase, the statements gathered so far were critically discussed and some of them reformulated. Also, some statements were reassigned to another component than they were initially formulated for. During this discussion it turned out that some statements could be better understood by making use of contradictory terms such as “... guided by feelings” versus “... guided by reason”. Hence, we decided that the questionnaire should consist of a list of paired, contradictory statements, which then could be used to describe one’s personal experience of product use by indicating which of the two statements was more suitable. Accordingly, we gathered contradictory terms for all the statements, while those statements for which no INTUI. Exploring the Facets of Intuitive Interaction. 4 opposite could be found were excluded. Finally, we selected a set of items for a first version of the questionnaire on intuitive interaction. In order to create a measurement tool which can be easily applied with manageable expenditure we did not want more than twenty items for the final version of the questionnaire. We therefore aimed at selecting about thirty items for the first version, with the idea to keep about half of them for the final version. So again, the collection of statements was critically observed and items which were quite long, compli	holism;human–computer interaction;microsoft windows;spontaneous order;usability testing;user experience;zeller's congruence;ipad	Daniel Ullrich;Sarah Diefenbach	2010				HCI	-64.39500510039876	-31.62306100284245	181014

Cultures are live, open and in continuous change. Computer and information technology, as external factors for non-Western-industrialized societies, may trigger transformations, that sometimes, could be considered as negative or unwanted. For example, the usage of Western word-processors modified the Japanese writing system when Japanese people faced a number of unfamiliar concepts introduced in those computer tools [8]. At the same time, minority societies around the world are in danger of extinction. The Nasa people, our target population, struggle to revitalize their mother tongue and cultural traditions. This text presents an experience about developing or adapting computer tools to help the revitalization efforts. The use of the computer could lead to positive effects, or at least, to effects aligned with the policies of the society.	central processing unit;computer;human–computer interaction	Santiago Ruano Rincón;Annabelle Boutet;Gilles Coppin;Franck Poirier;Tulio Rojas Curieux	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21660-2_63	humanities;engineering;communication;anthropology	HCI	-68.34743034688698	-31.26261459033764	181630

Many researchers have been investigating the differences in users' gender while experiencing digital products. However, it seems that few studies have investigated gender differences related to the creative process in digital design. The aim of this paper is to try to understand whether there are gender differences in the creative process in digital design in Brazil. In addition, it discusses the possible influences that women have in the design process and their approach to user experience design. For that, interviews and questionnaires with Brazilian designers, both women and men, were carried out. This investigation points out some gender aspects that can make difference in the design of digital products and presents a discussion of the role of women designers.

Originally, the project took its outset in the design of a pervasive computing platform suited for the mobile, collaborative, and time-critical work of clinicians in a hospital setting. Out of this grew a conceptual framework, a set of six ABC principles, and a programming and runtime framework for the development of activity-based computing infrastructures and applications. Lately, these principles and technologies have been successfully moved to other application areas, and is now used to design and implement activitybased computing support for work in a biology laboratory and for global software development.	software development;ubiquitous computing;window of opportunity	Jakob Eyvind Bardram	2011			simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;end-user computing	HCI	-66.57329821592947	-37.47595513964017	184579

What should young people know about these data collection and analysis efforts? Although critiques of these new forms of data collection and analysis have grown increasingly loud, the voices of users, and particularly youth, have largely been absent. This paper explores the critical perspectives of youth who are programming with public data about their own learning and social interaction in the Scratch online community. Using a bottom-up approach based on ethnographic observation of discussions among these young users, we identify a series of themes in how these youth critique, question, and debate the implications of data analytics. We connect these themes-framed in terms of critical data literacies-to expert critiques and discuss the implications of these findings for education and design.	information privacy;online community;scratch (programming language);socialization;top-down and bottom-up design	Samantha Hautea;Sayamindu Dasgupta;Benjamin Mako Hill	2017		10.1145/3025453.3025823	multimedia	HCI	-66.48335488647533	-34.73915717287553	185538

From theatre and theme parks to autoshows and airports, commercial interdisciplinary design and production teams have extended and solidified the new media agenda. The success of this track record is demonstrated by the increasing presence of commercial design techniques and knowledge in the creation of immersive new media within the cultural sphere, as proven by London's Natural History Museum, or the Melbourne Museum.This paper introduces the notion of digital cultural communication, a continuum through which designers can consider the place of narrative and experience and their attributes within public and commercial institutions. Digital cultural communication allows users to become co-creators of knowledge by providing tools and methods which enable the co-construction of creative artefacts. This paper uses a case study from Australia's rich cultural institution sector to illustrate the conceptual design of new media co-creative environment using an HCI-derived methodology supported by participatory action research. It is hoped that this method will demonstrate to curators of cultural experiences the cost-effective possibilities for enabling audiences to create rich narrative from user-led content.	experience design;human–computer interaction;new literacies;new media;robustness (computer science);software engineering;testament;triune continuum paradigm;usability	Jerry Watkins;Angelina Russo	2005		10.1145/1056224.1056245	cost-effectiveness analysis;cultural analysis;new media;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;interaction design;natural history;conceptual design;multimedia;sustainability;participatory action research	HCI	-63.73754565884392	-34.36839351958024	185644

Here we present the data comparison of user behavior in well-known Moodle and EdX learning environments. We propose the New Media art code analysis as an experimental method for eContent evaluation, and present the design science research method as a tool for application of e-learning research results. This paper is a part of a cross-cutting research in the fields of digital / new media art and ICT product innovation. The research is aimed at finding a path to open up the cache of knowledge situated in the theory of modern art, and to incorporate the codes of modern art into the field of ICT. The goal of the research is to transfer knowledge of modern art into areas traditionally not related to contemporary art and its specific academic trends, as well as to encourage the intersection of these disciplines. Consequently, this research aims to create a new profile of products that would exemplify modern interdisciplinary and analytic thought.	accessibility;code;ecosystem;exemplification;experiment;new media;situated;static program analysis;edx	Ieva Gintere;Viktors Zagorskis;Atis Kapenieks	2018		10.5220/0006787304260431	multimedia;computer science;new media	ML	-68.96470593006894	-36.977598766467366	186551

Alhough design in the domain of human-computer interaction has been widely investigated, the focus of research has been mainly on the user’s role and several authors refer to the need for a deeper understanding of the increasingly complex interaction design processes. This paper suggests a conceptual framework for interaction design that accommodates and unifies different perspectives from general design research while considering the specificities of the domain. Within the framework, description and analysis is done through the lens of design spaces, design artefacts, and refinement relationships between design artefacts. The framework extends existing concepts of design spaces by introducing complex spaces which acknowledge that design is rarely an individual activity but is more often undertaken by teams of designers. The framework also offers a distinction between design options into alternatives and variants to better describe and guide processes of idea generation and a convergence within, and between different sub-spaces and sub-teams. Different types of refinement between design artefacts are also discussed.	high- and low-level;human–computer interaction;interaction design;refinement (computing);situated;weitao yang	Judy Bowen;Anke Dittmar	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67744-6_30	coping (psychology);situated;ideation;analytical skill;computer science;management science;interaction design;conceptual framework;teamwork;design research	HCI	-63.703881522124114	-35.77057907566928	187381

A semiotic analysis of two websites—a Christian Virtual Church and a Hindu Virtual Temple—suggests the potential for demarcating distinct online sacred spaces, in a Durkheimian sense, in which devotees can engage in ritual activity. The article focuses on the performance of cyberpuja in the Virtual Temple and the posting of prayers in the Virtual Church. Interviews with the Web designers and an analysis of the sites suggest that the virtual is primarily conceived in terms of a simulation of the “real.” Consequently these sites are envisaged in terms of conventional notions of sacred space and ritual performance, rather than as something radically new.	spaces	Stephen Jacobs	2007	J.

The research phase got as a result that there is a lack of information appropriation towards alimentary matters, mainly caused by their lack of spare time and heavy work loads. Having this in consideration, the proposal is an interactive social tool to aim this lack of information appropriation. Based on User-Centered Design, Information Visualization, Situated and Significant Learning, the tool displays interactive messages on a table, through sensors and video mapping, allowing corporate employees to assimilate information while eating at their work spaces. Methods used in prototyping and testing were helpful to evaluate not only the tool as in its hardware, also the relevance of the messages displayed and the graphic solution chosen to show them (infographics, diagrams, text).	interactivity	Diana M.

Indeed, the challenge of such e-services is not only on the technological aspects of Internet with new infrastructures and architectures to conceive. The reality is also on its human and multimedia content delivery, with innovative philosophies of communication to apply in this digital and virtual age. In the context of Teaching and Learning as a human-centered design approach, we propose a new paradigm for thinking the Web, called the Web of Signs, rather than the Web of things. It focuses on the process of making knowledge by sharing signs and significations (Semiotic Web), more than on knowledge transmission with intelligent object representations (Semantic Web). Sign management is the shift of paradigm for education with ICT (e-Education) that we have investigated in such domains as enhancing natural and cultural heritage. In this paper, we will present this concept and illustrate it with two examples issued from La Reunion Island projects in instrumental e-Learning (@-MUSE) and biodiversity informatics (IKBS). This Sign management method was experimented in the frame of our Living Lab in Teaching and Learning at University of Reunion Island.	biodiversity informatics;digital distribution;e-services;future internet;gigabyte;harsh realm;internet access;knowledge-based systems;linear algebra;living lab;programming paradigm;semantic web;semiotics;stunt island;user-centered design;web of things;world wide web	Noël Conruyt;Véronique Sébastien;Olivier Sébastien;David Grosser;Didier Sébastien	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-54897-0_10	web development;web modeling;simulation;engineering;knowledge management;multimedia	Web+IR	-68.58295686338171	-34.11594128173513	188824

The study was initiated by the realisation that discussions surrounding the improvement of building performances tend to be about top-down technological solutions rather than to help and encourage bottom-up involvement of building-users. While users are the ultimate beneficiaries and their feedback is always appreciated, their direct involvements in managing buildings would often be regarded as obstruction or distraction. This is largely because casual interventions by uninformed building-users tend to disrupt the system. Some earlier researches showed however that direct and active participation of users could improve the building performance if appropriate training and/or systems were introduced. We also speculate this in long run would also make the built environment more sustainable. With this in mind, we looked for opportunities to retrofit our own office with an interactive layer to study how we could introduce ad-hoc systems for building-users. The aim of this paper is to describe our vision and initial attempts followed by discussion.	bottom-up proteomics;hoc (programming language);mind;performance;robertson–seymour theorem;top-down and bottom-up design	Yasu Santo	2012		10.1145/2414536.2414617	simulation;human–computer interaction;scenario;management	HCI	-62.984644372054525	-35.87437390921316	189648

The dynamic nature of the design process will be discussed in order to better understand how these aspects impact on a designer’s ability to act effectively in design. Design/methodology/approach – A second-order cybernetic framework is offered as a means to facilitate a designer’s capacity to act as an observer-participant in the co-creation of a design solution. It characterizes the design process as a conversation to enhance a designer’s ability to conceptually develop novel design solutions in participative situations. Findings – The significance of the designer in the design process and the design solution is established. A second-order cybernetic framework provides an explanation for a designer’s actions by acknowledging their presence in the design process. This makes possible the collaborative development of a design situation and its solution between various participants in this process through negotiation and mutual understanding. Practical implications – It is envisaged that the value of cybernetic concepts as a means to augment interaction, reflection, mutual understanding, creativity and innovation to facilitate designerly ways of knowing, thinking, and acting, is realized. Originality/value – The main value of this framework is for designers who struggle with finding an appropriate framework to facilitate and rationalize the subjective nature of human-centred design methods and the complexity of design.	cybernetics	Natalie Ebenreuter	2007	Kybernetes	10.1108/03684920710827328	cybernetics;design methods;idef6;computer science;artificial intelligence;design review;conceptual design;management science;design education;design brief	HCI	-63.83414281124227	-35.704579994950834	189882

The Contextual Identity Framework combines three conflicting views of context to try and define its boundaries in information behavior. However, it is not clear in which of these three views of context would 'information source' fit. Would it be part of the shared context or contextual stereotype or both? Also, prior studies have often muddled the distinction between sources and channels, and between sources and source types. They have not been comprehensive in classifying types of information sources, especially with the advent of new media. To help address these gaps, this theoretical study proposes: 1) a classification of information source types; 2) a workflow of interaction among different possible elements of context; and 3) the placement of information source within the context of information seeking behavior as defined by the Contextual Identity Framework. The frameworks should help us better understand information sources in relationship to the context of information seeking behavior, and help lend greater rigor to empirical studies relating to a person's choice of information sources. It would also benefit designers of search systems paving the way for the possible information seeking systems that take the context of search into consideration.	contextual inquiry;information seeking behavior;information source;new media	Naresh Kumar Agarwal	2011		10.1145/1940761.1940768	information needs;knowledge management;information integration;political science;context model;information quality;communication;social psychology	HCI	-64.78569391557616	-32.62693781936522	190685

What today we know about learning from cognitive psychology is that people learn by practicing, with feedback to tell them what theyu0027re doing right and wrong and how to get better. For STEM education, that means they need to practice thinking like a scientist in the field. So e-REAL is a cornerstone: developed as workplace learning system in a number of fields (from medical simulation to soft skills development within the continuing education), it’s an ideal solution to root a practical – but not simplicistic - approach for STEM education.	holography	Fernando Salvetti;Barbara Bertagni	2017	iJAC		knowledge management;personalization;computer science;multimedia;flipped classroom;immersion (virtual reality);standardization;medical simulation;visualization;soft skills;interactive learning	HCI	-69.96373029256642	-31.581544755429263	191123

Wikis, blogs, online groups and forums, podcasts, virtual worlds, and social tagging are but a few of the applications enabling innovative behaviors that support acquisition, access, manipulation, retrieval, and visualization of information. It is, therefore, no surprise that educational practitioners and theorists have begun to explore how social media can be harnessed to describe and implement new paradigms for communication, learning, and education. The editors goal in publishing this book was to identify original research on the application of online social media and related technologies in education as well as emerging applications in Web technologies that could provide and shape future educational platforms. The selected contributions deal with questions such as how social media can truly enrich and enhance learning and teaching experiences in ways not otherwise possible; how learning can be integrated in a distributed and ubiquitous social computing environment; or what theories, paradigms, and models are applicable for the support of social computing in education. Researchers in education or educational software will find interesting and sometimes provocative chapters on paradigms and methodologies, virtual and mobile learning spaces, and assessment and social factors. Practitioners in these fields will benefit from an additional section devoted to case studies and first experience reports.	social media	Download Here	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-20392-3	educational technology;social learning;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;social computing	ML	-67.5410826707765	-37.28642130719689	193177

We propose augmenting a multimedia document repository (digital library) with innovative knowledge evolution support, including computer-mediated communications, community process support, decision support, advanced hypermedia features, and conceptual knowledge structures. These tools, and the techniques developed around them, would enable members of a virtual community to learn from, contribute to, and collectively build upon the community's knowledge and improve many member tasks. The resulting Collaborative Knowledge Evolution Support System (CKESS) would provide an enhanced digital library infrastructure serving as an ever-evolving repository of the community's knowledge, which members would actively use in everyday tasks and regularly update.	code refactoring;decision support system;digital library;evolution;hypermedia;jove;virtual community	Michael Bieber;Douglas C.

The knowledge structures created should fit into the real world environment and reflect the common ground reached and evolved in the cooperation process of the knowledge workers. In order to facilitate the development of shared understanding among knowledge workers, Herbert Clark's theory on language use and Jean Piaget's cognitive theory are applied to the use of hypermedia language in cooperative work settings. To make the theories easier to apply, a conceptual framework is derived from them, which can inform the design and comparison of cooperative hypermedia systems and the use of hypermedia in cooperative settings.	hypermedia;jean;piaget's theory of cognitive development	Weigang Wang;Jessica Rubart	2006		10.1145/1149941.1149953	ground;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;conceptual framework	HCI	-65.36327185304381	-33.7846128072529	194461

b937a29dd794e0c78ff7ba7439b5cfc3b08e992d	alternative 3d education for children: course design of 3d printing interactivity for beijing's primary schools		New forms of extracurricular programs on creativity in primary schools are bound to emerge in the near future due to the popularization of 3D printing technology. This paper acknowledges the current situation of development of the extracurricular creative programs in China's primary schools, underlining the importance to introduce 3D printing and rapid prototyping technologies in the extracurricular activities. To sustain this argument, the activities of several creative 3D printing courses will be explained and discussed in the paper. Moreover, it will be shown how the particularity of the courses came from the combination of 3D printing technologies with culinary arts, bringing together traditional recipes with immersive and unexpected culinary experiences.  The paper is divided in three parts. In the first part the state of the art of the extracurricular activities in primary schools in China will be shown. The second part will introduce the educational action research as the main methodological framework used in the teaching activities. In the third part the examples will be presented emphasizing on the importance and advantages of experiential learning. The conclusion will present the level of satisfaction of the students, and the benefits of introducing rapid prototyping technologies in the primary schools.	3d printing;digital modeling and fabrication;experience;interactivity;mobile device;rapid prototyping;smartphone;warez	Ding Ting;Chawchen Zhaochen	2017		10.1145/3080631.3080637	immersion (virtual reality);interactivity;the arts;experiential learning;multimedia;action research;rapid prototyping;beijing;creativity;pedagogy;engineering	HCI	-69.05328377329306	-36.9118666970212	196335

4d79ce32f6ab9d7d9ba953b182ecb9f4d84b7b14	radio healer: hacking the wii remote to perform indigenous re-imagined ceremony	human computer interaction;interactive museum	Radio Healer is a performance project in residence at the Pueblo Grande Museum in Phoenix, Arizona. During Radio Healer performances, indigenous electronic tools (many of which are created from salvaged materials and hacked Nintendo Wii Remotes) are performed together with traditional indigenous instruments. The convergence of traditional and contemporary indigenous instruments demonstrates value-laden tensions between notions of what is considered traditional and contemporary. At the same time Radio Healer illustrates that despite these tensions, traditional and contemporary technology can connect to each other in useful and meaningful ways (Figure 1). By creating this rivaling complexity, Radio Healer provides an indigenous ground for inclusive public dialogues. Following performances, project artists facilitate dialogues that provide opportunities for audience interpretations of the performance, which often unpack Radio Healer as a metaphor for various lived experiences within the contexts of place, connected-knowledge, culture, relationships, and pervasive media.	experience;performance;pervasive informatics;pueblo;wii remote plus	Cristóbal Martinez;Randy Kemp;Raven Kemp;Joe French;Robert Esler	2014		10.1145/2662155.2662223	social science;human–computer interaction;computer science;engineering;sociology	HCI	-63.56972537747245	-31.137011912281665	197502

Beginning with an historical look at this field, and identifying some of the key moments in its development, the work then brings together reflection from experience, and knowledge from literature, to describe and explain the nature of Child Computer Interaction. In this process, the authors highlight the key differences that set CCI apart from Human Computer Intraction (HCI) and explore the extent to which both similarities and differences impact on the methods and approaches needed for research and practice in CCI. Key differences that are identified are the rate of change of children, the involvement of adult participants in children’s interactions, the contexts in which children use computer technology, and the underlying cultural and societal assumptions about technology and children that determine what is good for children and what has value.	human computer;human–computer interaction	Janet C.

fb57ad837c3dbc5de6c47643ee416e1efffa194b	trustworthiness of visualizations of mobility-induced co2 emissions	workshop	In the face of global warming, CO2 emissions have to be reduced. Everybody can contribute by making CO2 aware decisions. But what decisions are good? Next to texts and figures, visualizations are an important communicative tool to encapsulate information in a way that is understood quickly and potentially changes consumer behavior. To have an impact, they have to evoke the trust of the recipient. In this qualitative study we address the mostly neglected topic of how individuals come to trust visualizations. We conducted interviews with eight subjects to compare trustworthiness of two visualizations of CO2 emissions of different means of transportation, either using a bar chart or a chart that depicts differently sized clouds. We analyzed the answers by categorizing different criteria. Overall, the bar chart was considered more trustworthy. We argue that trustworthiness of visualizations follows a complex process, which considers different criteria that interact with each other. The criteria with the most influence trustworthiness are: completeness of information, necessity of information, neutrality, reading accuracy and plainness of the graph. Lastly, trust might follow a U-shaped curve when plotted over the density of graph-features.	categorization;trust (emotion)	Laura Platte;Svenja Freitag;Lisa Schubert;Jerg Molis;André Calero Valdez;Martina Ziefle	2016		10.18420/muc2016-ws11-0006	internet privacy;trustworthiness;environmental science	HCI	-64.44438332510617	-31.641717706664014	199037
