244d52e63a7af6ade399c00ad88def703c6b5a67	a system architecture for a transnational data infrastructure supporting maritime spatial planning		The use of the seas and oceans is overall regulated by the United Nations through the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which defines the rights and responsibilities. However, with the rapidly increasing use of the sea and oceans it is inevitable that conflicts may arise. Accordingly, there has been an increasing international recognition of the need to manage human activities that influence the marine environment and its ecosystems in an integrated, cross-sectoral manner. Recently, Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) has gained significant attention as a new paradigm aiming at minimising the conflicts among different sea uses through involving various stakeholders and sectors while aiming for sustainable growth. The aim of this research is to build a conceptual model for a Data Infrastructure to support marine space in a transnational context addressing the challenges related to the increasing use of marine areas and resources. The work was carried out in a close cooperation between several public authorities and research institutes in the Baltic Sea Region.	accessibility;centralisation;dvd region code;data infrastructure;directive (programming);distributed computing;download;ecosystem;information system;max;programming paradigm;prototype;region-based memory management;systems architecture;systems design;trustworthy computing	Henning Sten Hansen;Ida Maria Reiter;Lise Schrøder	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-64248-2_12	conceptual model;spatial planning;environmental resource management;open data;systems architecture;environmental science;spatial data infrastructure;united nations convention on the law of the sea	HCI	-64.57043927509193	-5.273493550761368	152685

1d045f4f347409f0635c9d15d538dbfabb6b38fa	environmental data science		Abstract Environmental data are growing in complexity, size, and resolution. Addressing the types of large, multidisciplinary problems faced by todayu0027s environmental scientists requires the ability to leverage available data and information to inform decision making. Successfully synthesizing heterogeneous data from multiple sources to support holistic analyses and extraction of new knowledge requires application of Data Science. In this paper, we present the origins and a brief history of Data Science. We revisit prior efforts to define Data Science and provide a more modern, working definition. We describe the new professional profile of a data scientist and new and emerging applications of Data Science within Environmental Sciences. We conclude with a discussion of current challenges for Environmental Data Science and suggest a path forward.		Karina Gibert;Jeffery S. Horsburgh;Ioannis N.

That information provides rich reference for regional analysis in China. The primary challenges under rapid data growth include how to efficiently integrate those space-time data, provide methodology for different research targets, and promote their applications in different fields. This report will present some recent developments of spatial intelligence technologies for spatial data integration, data analysis, as well as their applications. The report will introduce the newly developed spatial explorer (China Geo-Explorer) as a joint effort by the University of Michigan China Data Center and Wuhan University. It will demonstrate how space-time data of different formats and sources can be integrated, visualized, analyzed and reported in a web based system. Some applications in disaster assessment, environment and health, cultural and religious studies will be discussed for China and global studies.

Having information at the most opportune moment is key to saving lives and property during occurrences of natural disasters as well as providing immediate relief to the victims. When regular citizens take part in providing information to authorities that may respond to critical situations, more tragedies may be averted and more needs may be alleviated. Leveraging on the high penetration rate of SMS services in the country, eBayanihan Patroller provides a crowdsourcing SMS service that will allow every Filipino to provide the information needed for informed decision-making.	crowdsourcing;iteration;iterative and incremental development;iterative method;rapid application development;scrum (software development)	Marlene M.

7e63994054ba96c042ed3617e914be85a3daac2c	foreword to the applied data science: invited talks track at kdd-2017		"""The Applied Data Science (ADS) Invited Talks Track at KDD-2017 is a continuation of what has now become a """"7-year tradition"""" at KDD conferences. This is the second year the track operates under the ADS name, an evolution from its origins at KDD-2011 as the """"Industry Practice Expo"""". The KDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) is the world's first, largest and best conference on Data Science, Data Mining, and Knowledge Discovery. It brings together a healthy mix of academic researchers, industry and government researchers, and practitioners from a wide range of institutions and fields. The primary focus on KDD is on peer-reviewed research contributions and the academic advancement of the field. This is an important goal and in fact the KDD conference is now recognized as the most competitive and prestigious forum for presenting high quality research results. KDD, being fundamentally an applied field, needs the strong representation of applied work of big impact. Over the years of running the conference we observed that our initial speaker-selection approach needed to be re-thought because of the important contributions made to the field outside traditional academic, industrial and government research laboratories. The result of this re-thinking was to create a forum that exposes important contributions to Data Science through Big Data Applications that address strategic problems. We wanted to effectively capture the rising importance of Data Science and Machine Learning especially in the Big Data environment where structured and unstructured data create special challenges, and of course present new opportunities. The goal of the Invited Talks Track is to curate contributions from leaders in our field who have made important contributions through the development of a system, the creation of a new and important business, or the development and market introduction of a product,. Some of these important contributions may never see an academic paper or detailed peer-reviewed paper written about them, yet they are of critical importance to our very applied field. To give you an idea of how rapidly growing this area is, and how this sector of our industry and promises to be highly disruptive across many industries, we cite a couple of articles out of a plethora of such coverage: According to IDC, the global revenues from Big Data and business will grow from $130.1 billion in 2016 to more than $203 billion in 2020, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.7% [1]. Furthermore, to quote from a Forbes article: """"Data monetization"""" will become a major source of revenues, as the world will create 180 zettabytes of data (or 180 trillion gigabytes) in 2025, up from less than 10 zettabytes in 2015.?

This is in part due to the cost and complexities involved in preparing this data for third parties. Health data must be adequately de-identified -- a complex process resulting in full or partial """"synthetic"""" data. This paper discusses technological challenges in this process when balancing the preservation of an individual's privacy against the preservation of the data's utility. An example is open health data, where the process of de-identification is often so rigorous that the data is useless for meaningful observational studies. Our discussion is made concrete by considering an open health data set by the American Centres of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)."""	de-identification;privacy;synthetic data	Christian Guttmann;Xingzhi Sun;Chaitanya Rao;Carlos Queiroz;Benjamin I.

01c7141dc936fae38abc48b3a839268638e1abf2	a multidisciplinary spatial data infrastructure for the mediterranean to support implementation of the marine strategy framework directive		The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) adopted in 2008 aims to protect the marine environment through the holistic Ecosystem Approach (EA). The MSFD requires Member States to develop and implement cost-effective measures to achieve and/or maintain “Good Environmental Status” (GEnS). To this end, interested parties require a large amount of data and this data should be appropriately managed. This is particularly true for EA applications, where data can come from diverse sources, in diverse formats, and from several disciplines.

In an effort to implement this type of multidisciplinary analysis, a working group from the KnowSeas project (www.knowseas.com) created a Spatial Data Infrastructure for the Mediterranean Sea, designed to define and analyze the GEnS concept across various geographical scales. This article describes the implementation of this SDI, demonstrating how an interoperable system can provide strong support in implementing the MSFD under the EA, and how marine spatial planning can assist policymakers in the decision making process.	data infrastructure;directive (programming);holism;interoperability;norm (social)	Sergio Cinnirella;David March;Tim O'Higgins;Carla Murciano;Rafael Sardà;Joan Albaigés;Nicola Pirrone	2012	IJSDIR		environmental science;environmental planning;environmental engineering;environmental resource management	DB	-64.57120540397838	-5.4669792813942255	182205

This change triggered the creation of new administrative procedures in the every day life of European universities. It also gave rise to the emergence of new concepts for the description of curricula. It is critical for the successful continuation of this process to support the publication and exchange of information among universities. With this aim in mind, we created the Bowlogna Ontology to model an academic setting as proposed by the Bologna reform. In this paper, we present our efforts to design this ontology and the entire process that lead to its creation starting from the definition of a linguistic lexicon derived from the Bologna reform and its conversion to a formal ontology. We also describe practical applications of our ontology for end-users at universities (such as a faceted search and browsing system for course information).	agile software development;continuation;emergence;faceted classification;formal ontology;lexicon	Gianluca Demartini;Iliya Enchev;Joël Gapany;Philippe Cudré-Mauroux	2013	Semantic Web	10.3233/SW-2012-0064	upper ontology;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;ontology;data science;process ontology	Web+IR	-66.08887231321899	-5.800442849485753	182841

One interaction component is the user interface; the other deeper components represent the applications’ logic and core functionality. Internationalization architectures recognize the need for localizing user interfaces to particular cultures. We continue the discussion on culture and software focusing on the software core rather than the user interface. This core corresponds to deep culture as opposed to the surface cultural manifestations embedded in the user interface. We argue here that deep culture can be embedded into application software in a modular way.

The state of application software today seems to indicate that U.S. technologists and so-called, software evangelists still determine the user experience based on their own cultural biases. To date, the development of software for a culture different from the culture of its authors has been focused on adapting the user interface. This method is referred to as software internationalization. The underlying assumption behind software internationalization is that all of the culturally and linguistically sensitive software components can be separated from the locale-independent core of the application (Hall, 1999, p. 298), (Nakakoji, 1996; Hall and Hudson, 1997). The assumption of the culture-dependent interface and the culture-independent core has helped software companies to develop programs for international markets without re-writing the very same application for every new national market. The perspective that all cultural aspects are encapsulated in the external layer of the software has been fundamental in porting application to international markets. We will argue with this traditional engineering approach (Sommerville, 1992), which (1) separates the human interface from the mechanics of the apparatus, and (2) assumes that changing the interface is all that is necessary to change the usability of that apparatus (Laurel, 1991). At the early stage of the innovation curve simplification and reductionism are often necessary to understand complex situations, construct models and build machines. The ability to match a problem’s complexity with its representation and machinal embodiment increases with the discovery of methods and techniques that are specialized for a particular type of innovation. The discussion presented here is based on the assumption that the current state of the software development processes allows for a richer perspective on the culture-software relationship than that being employed today. In this chapter we present arguments behind the claim that cultural concerns penetrate beyond the user interface. Contrary to what the current methods of engineering of international software would suggest, we consider the software core being culturedependent. There are two interconnected motivations behind this statement: (1) the software core is a technology which, according to some theories of technology, is rooted in, and shaped by, culture (Heidegger, 1977; Feenberg, 1991; Ferre, 1995); and (2) and unlike many other technologies software describes and automates complex activities and whole processes that previously were undertaken by people and organizations. The core of a software artefact embeds decision-making, rules of behaviour and patterns of actions that depend on culture (Juustila, 1995; Kaplan, 1995; Hofstede, 1997). Consequently, embedding the attributes of the users’ culture requires changes to the design of software architectures that go beyond the current international standards for software architecture and localization. This chapter continues the discussion on culture and software and the dominant role of Western cultures, the U.S. in particular, in software development (Taylor, 1992; Juustila, 1995; Kaplan, 1995; Nakakoji, 1996; Carmel, 1997; Kersten, Matwin et al., 2000). Two perspectives on culture are presented, followed by three theories of technology. Then perspectives on culture are coupled with theories of technology. This theorybased assessment is illustrated with three examples of culture being embodied in the software core. A proposal for software “culturalization” is then formulated. It is based on the recognition that deep cultures can be embedded in software. This should happen, as we conclude, even if one assumes that the impact of national cultures diminishes. 14 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the publisher's webpage: www.igi-global.com/chapter/software-culture-beyondinternationalization-interface/4527"""	complexity;component-based software engineering;e-commerce;embedded system;fax;gordon hunter (academic);hudson;ian sommerville (technician);information management;internationalization and localization;kaplan–meier estimator;os-tan;pa-risc;reductionism;software architecture;software development process;text simplification;theory;uniform resource identifier;usability;user experience;user interface;value (ethics);web page	Gregory E.

These range from climate changes, animal/fish population cycle variations, invasive species introduction, and cultural affects of indigenous peoples to problems associated with natural disasters, oil spills, land development, and criminal enterprises. The U.S. Department of the Interior National Park Service (NPS) has issued a Natural Resource Challenge to pursue the preservation of the many diverse national parks in all 50 states and U.S. territories. According to the NPS National Park Service Action Plan for preserving natural resources, a focused methodology is necessary to achieve this challenge. By investigating the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve (WRST) in Southeastern Alaska as a specific illustration of a complex U.S. national park environment, this paper proposes a solution for national park protection in the 21st century via the application of a network-enabled effects-based requirements approach married with a well-defined extended enterprise architecture. The interconnection of planning systems, monitoring sensors, visualization tools, and other information sources will allow for knowledge instantiation and quick reaction to national park threats. This paper further discusses some command systems in use by U.S. forestry agencies and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) that could be used to form an initial realization of a network-enabled, effects-based approach to national park protection. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Focus is on a new framework for the use of computing resources, interfaces for data and application interchange, based on current developments regarding infonomics systems, case studies within the long-term GEXI project, and Active Source. A suitable framework base has been created over the last years, being used for a number of scenarios in research environments, using High End Computing resources. Application of these methods for commercial service structures affords the consideration of various legal aspects. In collaboration with international partners from geosciences, industry, economy, and education the framework has been found the solution to overcome the legal cooperation barrier. Established on this work, international cooperations are currently built. This paper presents the results of applying the framework, reducing complexity in collaboration management.	crc-based framing;d-grid;e-society;eulisp;infonomics;information system;legal informatics;supercomputer	Claus-Peter Rückemann	2010	2010 Fourth International Conference on Digital Society	10.1109/ICDS.2010.56	computer science;knowledge management;information security;data mining;management science;world wide web;computer security;information system	HPC	-64.39658407672425	-5.072353308327333	191522

Little has been said, however, on whether there would be unintended side-effects of changing the voting technology, in terms of the votes cast. Security issues aside, should we expect the introduction of an electronic voting system to affect the results of the election? This paper attempts to tease out some of the possible effects, by analysing ballot data from the 2008 Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Legislative Assembly Election.	confusion matrix;level of detail;list of sega arcade system boards;user interface design	James M Heather;Morgan Llewellyn;Vanessa Teague;Roland Wen	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-32747-6_15	public relations;voting;public economics;political science;computer security;disapproval voting	AI	-69.48197839296868	-8.564872721013653	194899

There is often significant financial incentive to use a robot (or a botnet) to artificially create fake views. How can we detect the fake views? Can we detect them (and stop them) efficiently? What is the extent of fake views with current VoD service providers? These are the questions we study in this paper.

b0ceab35c33b27e8073a2f3177d57c459a470404	cybersecurity policies and their impact on dynamic data driven application systems		The objective of this paper is to explore how cybersecurity policies pertaining to data privacy, data acquisition, data fusion and data mining, impact the feasibility and functionality of Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems (DDDAS). In this work, a social media network model, will serve as the DDDAS of study in order to reveal how varying cybersecurity policies, could alter the functionality and usefulness of the system. At its fundamental level, the social media network model proposed in this work, TEchnology PHobia readiness CONdition (TEPHCON), seeks to serve as a decision support system that dynamically captures and visualizes society's affinity/aversion towards current or emerging technologies. However, at its core, this DDDAS is built upon a data platform that is highly susceptible to changes in cybersecurity policies. For example, a change in cybersecurity policies pertaining to freedom of speech in a cyber environment, may significantly alter the access and availability of publicly-available data. On the other hand, a more hands-off cyber policy pertaining to who controls cyber infrastructure networking speeds, may result in an imbalance of data that may threaten the veracity of TEPHCON. Therefore, cybersecurity policies are an integral component of DDDAS systems such as TEPHCON and as such, their impact should be explored in detail.	affinity analysis;computer security;data acquisition;data mining;decision support system;dynamic data driven applications systems;information privacy;network model;risk aversion;social media;veracity	Conrad S.

6c89f70b060773d65b977a926ed0271ecab8232f	cloud computing for e-sciences at université sorbonne paris cité		The present paper relates the involvement towards migration and adoption of cloud computing at Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite (USPC), a major french consortium of universities and higher education and research institutes. Migration to the cloud for a wide and diverse community of actors is nevertheless not straightforward. The ambitious interdisciplinary program ‘Imageries du Vivant’ (IDV or ‘Life Imaging’) at USPC, a key program dedicated to the development and use of life and biomedical imaging, constitutes our use case. It allows to sketch how cloud computing may change scientific practices and the landscape of computing, and to specify the steps to be followed for such purposes. The outcome of the paper is a methodology for accompanying adequate technological choices and acceptance by the users of the cultural changes when they migrate to cloud technologies. In short, we provide useful guidance for cloud adoption based on observations made for the IDV project.

Since security and confidentiality issues on the Internet have been major concerns in the OCHIS, the system has been based on healthcare public key infrastructure (HPKI), and found that there remained problems to be solved technically and operationally. An experimental study was conducted to elucidate the central and the local function in terms of a registration authority and a time stamp authority by contracting with the Ministry of Economics and Trading Industries in 2003. This paper describes the experimental design with NPO and the results of the study concerning message security and HPKI. The developed system has been operated practically in Osaka urban area.	basic stamp;biological science disciplines;confidentiality;contract agreement;data center;design of experiments;email;experiment;have trouble finding right words to express myself;heteroralfsia saxicola;information science;labor (childbirth);name;neuritis, autoimmune, experimental;nonprofit organizations;patients;primula yuparensis;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;trusted third party;united states public health service;funding grant;message;non-t, non-b childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia	Hiroshi Takeda;Yasushi Matsumura;Katsuhiko Nakagawa;Tadamasa Teratani;Qiyan Zhang;Hideo Kusuoka;Masami Matsuoka	2004	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-60750-949-3-1273	knowledge management;christian ministry;public key infrastructure;registration authority;the internet;health care;computer security;confidentiality;data exchange;medicine	Metrics	-69.89224769850374	-8.408005007857987	199407
