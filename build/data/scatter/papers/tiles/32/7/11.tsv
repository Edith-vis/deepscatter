14b761acfb37ecc254205ef6ba00fdabfc7fa375	effective bibliographic instruction for deaf and hearing-impaired college students	higher education;telecommunications	COLLEGENROLLMENT OF DEAF AND HEARING-IMPAIRED students is increasing steadily, and librarians must be prepared to meet the needs of these special students. Furthermore, with the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (P.L. 101-336 sec. 302), all private and public entities must make allowance for the equal enjoyment of goods, services, facilities, and accommodations by all disabled individuals. The greatest barrier to providing equal access to libraries for deaf or hearing-impaired students is communication, but staff training, specialized bibliographic instruction, written library materials, and special equipment can provide the deaf and hearingimpaired student with the same accessibility to academic library materials as that enjoyed by their hearing peers. INTRODUCTION Deaf students are a small but growing population on college campuses. Recent legislation mandating equal access to the facilities and services of all public and private entities for able and disabled citizens is one of many factors in this trend. While Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C.; the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in Rochester, New York; and California State University at Northridge provide special programs to educate deaf college Melanie J.

Technological advances in hearing aids have encouraged mainstreaming of deaf and hearing-impaired students in elementary and high schools. Mainstreamed students are likely to continue their education and choose colleges that they would not have considered in the past. As college enrollment continues to decline, disabled students are an untapped resource for college admissions. Whatever the reasons, college enrollment by deaf and hearing-impaired students is expected to increase, and librarians must be prepared to meet the needs of these special students. In order to succeed in higher education, students must understand basic library procedures. Providing bibliographic instruction to deaf students poses a special challenge for librarians. Unlike their hearing peers, most deaf students arrive on college campuses with little or no knowledge of basic library resources and systems. To complicate the situation, most librarians have little or no knowledge of deafness or preparation for instructing deaf individuals. All librarians at institutions of higher learning must be prepared to welcome and instruct deaf and hearing-impaired students in the effective use of their libraries. Programs and services should provide these students with the capabilities to proceed with their academic endeavors as independently as possible. This means effective bibliographic instruction. LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND Until the 1970s, the educational needs of deaf people were met by removing them from the “mainstream” of the regular classroom and serving them in either segregated self-contained classrooms or entirely separate residential schools for the deaf (Moores, 1987, p. 5). The Education for All Handicapped Children’s Act passed in 1975 mandated mainstreaming disabled students whenever possible. Since the passage of the Education for All Handicapped Children’s Act, more parents have enrolled their disabled children in public schools. The mainstream environment promotes interaction of disabled students with able peers thus encouraging a greater number of disabled students to attend colleges and universities that they once would not have considered. The Rehabilitation Act (1973) guarantees aid for educational advancement to disabled adults. Under these laws, no college or university that receives federal funds may refuse to admit students with a hearing loss. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), signed into effect on July 26, 1990, by President Bush, will mean changes in library 120 LIBRARY TRENDWSUMMER 1992 services for deaf patrons. Title I11 of the ADA specifies that “no inlvidual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodations operated by a private entity or business” (P.L. 101336). Libraries are included as one of these “facilities.” “Equal enjoyment” means that librarians must provide effective and successful instruction in library use to people who are deaf so that they can take full advantage of the library’s resources. The Education for All Handicapped Children’s Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADA all support the deaf individual in obtaining an education equal to that of a hearing individual at any institution of higher learning. LIBRARY STAFFTRAINING Effective library service begins with librarians. Training in serving the special needs of deaf and other lsabled patrons should begin in library schools where classes on serving special populations should be included in the curriculum. Overcoming attitudinal barriers is essential. Library students must understand that disabled students want to be treated like everyone else. A hearing impairment does not mean an intellectual weakness. If librarians do not feel comfortable when approached by deaf students, sensitive students will perceive the librarian’s unease (Mularski, 1987,p. 478). It is important for library administrators to support seminars that teach librarians how to work with deaf library users and provide information about other aspects of deafness. Librarians need to understand that deafness ranges from mild to severe, that some deaf people benefit from the use of a hearing aid while others do not, and that personal preferences in communication style vary and may include sign language, speaking and speechreading, and writing (see Goldmann and Mallory in this issue of Library Trends).For referral purposes, the librarian should also be aware of local, state, and national organizations available to people who are deaf. To comply with the ADA, libraries are advised to have at least one librarian on staff who knows sign language. If possible, some staff members should be given time off to attend sign language classes; with the growing number of colleges and high schools offering sign language courses, i t should not be much of a burden for at least one library staff member to learn sign language. This librarian could become the contact person for the disabled students on campus and could serve as a reliable source of information in the library for deaf and hearing-impaired students. If no librarian on staff can sign, a certified interpreter must be made available on demand. NORTON/BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION 121 Opportunities to learn and practice the manual alphabet and library related signs must be encouraged for the entire library staff to facilitate effective communication with deaf and hearing-impaired students. Finger spelling is basic to communicating with people who are deaf and hearing impaired and is relatively easy to learn. Most colleges and universities have a special office that serves the needs of self-identified disabled students who attend college (it is illegal for the admissions application to ask i f the applicant is disabled; students must volunteer this information). This office can provide a list of self-identified disabled students to the librarian in charge of services for the disabled. This list can prepare the entire library staff for the needs of incoming disabled students (Mularski, 1987, p. 481). The National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) is one of eight colleges at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). RIT’s Wallace Library provides services for all eight colleges on the RIT campus. One professional reference librarian is assigned to work with all disabled students on campus, including the nearly 1,200 deaf students who attend NTID. This is a unique situation. Certainly most academic librarians would not be faced with such a large number of deaf students. The presence of NTID at RIT has made it necessary for the Wallace Library staff to develop and provide effective and creative bibliographic instruction for deaf college students. BIBLIOGRAPHIC NSTRUCTION Effective communication is the key to effective instruction. It is easy for librarians to become frustrated with a patron’s lack of knowledge about how to use the library. It is especially frustrating when communication between the patron and the librarian breaks down. Ideally, library instruction should begin in elementary school. The fact is that most college freshmen have no idea how to use the library catalog or simple search tools such as the Reader’s Guide to Periodical Literature. Deaf students often have even less familiarity with the library because most of their precollege education has been consumed with learning and reinforcing everyday survival skills. Much of the early education for deaf children focuses on lipreading and communication skills (Locke, 1987, p. 5 ) . GROUPINSTRUCTION Before the librarian meets with a group of deaf students, he or she should contact their instructor to find out as much as possible about the class, particularly students’ reading levels and prior library experience. Many deaf college students have lower reading levels than 122 LIBRARY TRENDSAUMMER 1992 their hearing peers. For example, at NTID the average incoming freshman reads at an eighth grade level. The size of the group is a key factor in group instruction of deaf students. More than ten students in a group makes communication difficult. Deaf students need to see the hands of the person who is signing, whether this is the librarian or the interpreter. If there is no interpreter and the librarian does not si	accessibility;alice and bob;entity;information source;interpreter (computing);least-squares spectral analysis;librarian;library (computing);population;wallace tree	Melanie J.

The Internet could also be, for the technological elite, a means to contact and interact with remote computers. With the explosive growth of the World Wide Web, the paradigm shifted to one of publishing; not like traditional media owned and organised by a powerful elite, but instead a decentralised and open environment. As the web has matured, static pages have given way to interactive sites that change depending on world events, that animate, that react to what we do. As access to the Internet moves out from the computer to mobile phones, television and games consoles, we are forced to constantly re-evaluate the nature of ‘the web’ and what it will become. Sometimes it seems that the progress of technology is outstripping our understanding of it. It is precisely because of this that more fundamental and analytic views of this dynamic topic are necessary. Only by establishing deep understanding can we hope to reapply that knowledge to a shifting world. Our personal interest in this topic goes back many years, including database-driven web construction, while most sites were still at the ‘build it now and worry later’ stage! Over 2 years ago we planned a day conference together on “The Active Web”. Although we knew this was an exciting topic, the level of interest still took us by surprise. The conference was held at Staffordshire University in January 1999 and the enthusiasm generated by that, lead directly to the call for this special issue. We were a little more prepared for the response this time, but still it stretched our own expectations, not to mention our list of reviewers. We particularly want to thank our reviewers – the original “one or two” papers we asked them to review stretched way beyond that in several cases. Because of the large response, we are expecting to produce a further special issue on the topic. The change of the web from a passive ‘published’ medium to an interactive shared space raises both social and technological issues. It is good to see both sides of this represented within this issue. Light and Wakeman’s paper, “Beyond the Interface: User’s perceptions of Interaction and Audience on Websites”, addresses the question of what people feelwhen they interact with active web pages – who do they feel they are interacting with and why. Users are often forced to enter personal information to a very impersonal medium. Unlike a telephone or face-to-face interaction, there is little sense of reciprocity. For designers of interactive pages, at least one lesson is clear – don’t expect to be able to suck information from your users without giving reason, otherwise they are likely to take the only control remaining and leave your site.

They should take the time, individually and as a group, to evaluate the relative rightness and wrongness of the work itself, its uses, and its consequences. There are those who believe that a computer cannot be considered in terms of morality, because it is an object with no inherent properties of right and wrong ; what matters is how it is used. Unfortunately, this thinking leads some to believe that their work also should not be considered in terms of morality. They argue that they were hired to do a job and that they should not have to think about the consequences of their work. Granted that because computers cannot make value judgments, a computer's morality cannot be questioned. However, moral questions can be asked of the person who designs, programs, operates, manages the use of, and teaches about these computers. And because the morality of their work ca .n be questioned by others, computer specialists owe it to themselves to make their own evaluations, using their conscience and sense of values as guides. There are those that believe that if they are working on a project that is deemed to be socially constructive, then they can use any skills and knowledge to reach their goal. In other words, they believe that the end justifies the means. They argue that the achievement is what matters, not the manner of achievement . The following examples discredit that argument : First, suppose that a new employee, knowingly and without permission, uses confidential infor mation from his last employer for a hospital intensive-care computer program. The end is morally right, but the means-the use of confidential information-is clearly wrong, and perhaps illegal. Second, suppose that in order to get a job in computerized pollution control, a woman claims to have a much higher level of competence than she actually possesses. Even though the end-someone working on pollution control-is morally right, the new employer is being cheated by not getting full value for the salary that is being paid. The job may also be done better and in less time with a more qualified individual. There are others who are more interested in their work and its success than they are in the ultimate end to which their contributions will be put. This view can lead them to believe …	computer program;confidentiality;conscience	Gary M.

Giovannini (2008), for example, concludes that various technology factors, such as the public’s general increasing accessibility to the Internet as well as the continued advancement of various media forms, result in greater exposure and access by individuals to information than ever before. Additionally, Pyati (2007) advocates for an expanded use of technology as instruments of information and education. Pyati explains that, as technology develops, individuals’ methods for learning and communicating will adapt to fit these mediums of technology that better facilitate both learning and communication processes. Further, Holdren (2008) describes society’s current dependability on technology both to maintain the well being of individuals and to sustain economic, sociopolitical, and environmental conditions. In addition, Holdren explains the intricate balance between these constructs, demonstrating the value of each and their vital role in society as well as how each construct innately is tied to the influence of technology. As a result, often a contemporary, cogent role of science and technology remains facilitating stability within society. Furthermore, individuals within society, specifically children and students, are experiencing greater exposure to technology at younger ages than previous generations. Eteokleous (2008) reports this phenomena and details efforts of school systems and teachers to integrate computer usage and various other technology-related tools into the students’ forms of learning. In fact, numerous studies are showing that younger generations of students, who have grown up accustomed to the presence of technology, generally prefer its use over the traditional methods of accomplishing the same actions that do not involve technology. Denton, Madden, Roberts, and Rowe (2008), for example, found students to prefer electronic forms of grade-indicators rather than hand-written reports. In particular, when students in the sample received the critiques of their work electronically, they were found to perceive these criticisms in a more positive light thanwhen the same critiques were given inwriting. Not only does the literature report today’s students to have embraced the use of technology, but students also seem to hold positive perceptions regarding further integration of technology into daily life. Selwyn (2007), for example, specifically investigated students’ self-perceptions regarding various computer-based activities and their personal enjoyment or dissatisfactionwith these programs. or the Advancement of Educational Research Conference (2008, November), Hutchinson Island, FL.	accessibility;computer;dependability;internet;noise shaping;stunt island;whole earth 'lectronic link	Michael W.

At both the state and federal levels of government, ensurance that persons with disabilities have equal access to computers and technology is seen as an important step toward accomplishing this goal [1, 2]. In 1986, Congress reauthorized the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, (Public Law 99-506) adding Section 508 on electronic equipment accessibility """"to insure that handicapped individuals may use electronic office equipment with or without special peripher-als."""" Congress has mandated that guidelines for electronic equipment accessibility be established and adopted and that agencies are to comply with these guidelines with respect to electronic equipment, whether such equipment is purchased or leased. Additional legislative steps have also been taken. The Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1988 [Public Law 100-407], is funding the establishment of technology resource ~i ~i ~i ~i ~i i ~i ~i ~ ~ centers in all fifty states, for persons with disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act passed in July 1990 [Public Law 101-336], states that employers will need to provide """"reasonable accommodation"""" to individuals with disabilities including steps such as job restructuring and modification of equipment. Each of these legislative actions are strong indicators of a national commitment to make computers accessible to persons with disabilities. The purpose of this article is to provide computer professionals with practical information about computer access systems in the MS/ DOS and Macintosh environments which satisfy state and federal guidelines and meet the needs of persons with visual, orthopedic, learning, or hearing disabilities.

Do you concur with this point of view? KE: I believe it has. I think we are at the beginning of what the Internet and personalization are going to enable users and customers to do. It is important to note that personalization means many things to many people. Generally, what it means to me is oneto-one anything, even though it’s a one-to-many experience. So, if you think about this as the Web, anybody can be going to the Web, but it’s when I interact with the Web that it’s a personalized experience to me. So a useful question is, how do you actually enable my user experience to be something that’s enriching, compelling, serves my needs, and target goal alignment in terms of fulfilling my needs? I think the Internet with its Web services is uniquely positioned to really enable personalization because—I hate to use this old phrase—“its the unifying protocol between computing and communication.” Prior to this, we were able to do personalized communication through the telephone or personalized email, both of which are a one-to-one or one-to-many experience. It is not until you start to marry all the applications imaginable within the industry and then marry that with some front end—call it Web veneer, artificial intelligence, or a type of search engine—that a service then feels personal to me. It’s when I can put in filters, agents, personal screens, some set of rules defining what kind of advertising I want to receive, that I have personal control over the flow of information I send and receive. I think the industry has a tremendous ramp ahead of it over the next 5 to 10 years, but the benefits will be rewarding for everyone. I suspect this might be the last major platform for computing in my lifetime. That does not mean there will not be another one beyond it.	artificial intelligence;communications of the acm;email;internet;knowledge engineering;one-to-many (data model);one-to-one (data model);personalization;point of view (computer hardware company);ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;telecommunications network;user experience;web search engine;web service;world wide web	Doug Riecken	2000	Commun.

"""The central aim of many empirical studies in the physical, behavioral, social, and biological sciences is the elucidation of cause-effect relationships among variables. It is through causeeffect relationships that we obtain a sense of a """"deep understanding"""" of a given phenomenon, and it is through such relationships that we obtain a sense of being """"in control,"""" namely, that we are able to shape the course of events by deliberate actions or policies. It is for these two reasons, understanding and control, that causal thinking is so pervasive, popping up in everything from everyday activities to high-level decision-making: For example, every car owner wonders why an engine won't start; a cigarette smoker would like to know, given his/her specific characteristics, to what degree his/her health would be affected by refraining from further smoking; a policy maker would like to know to what degree anti-smoking advertising would reduce costs of health care; and so on.

The reason Laos was chosen as a research site was because it is one of the few countries that still preserves its relationships to material culture as described above. There are many examples of design groups working to revive the craft around the world; however, most of them are focused on preserving materials and know-hows (UNESCO 2005). The unique aspect of this project is the focus on meanings and symbolism, besides materials and techniques.  Weaving communities in Laos are known for their wonderful textiles. In the world we live in today, the decisions regarding the purchase of goods are made based on cost and benefit, and the value of handmade versus machine-made is overlooked by most. As a result, important intangible cultures such as Laos' weaving are slowly vanishing since these practices are no longer in line with our current capitalistic system. However, it is time to re-think the value of the material culture around us due to the environmental impact that materialism has brought to our planet. This project finds value in the traditional Asian handmade practices, aims to learn their values, and establish a design dialogue as a method to find sustainable economical platforms for such practices.  The main question of the design for project was:  How can designers create a working model with communities to preserve the meanings, materials, and know-hows to celebrate and preserve communities' material culture?

Computer technology is in a state of constant change. Staff must not only provide consulting on current products; they must also provide advice on future trends for users eager to remain on the cutting edge of technology. The pace is quickening rather than slowing. Frand et al., in a 1987 survey of university business schools, found that microcomputers, since their introduction in the late 1970s, have reached the same usage levels at universities that minicomputers and mainframes took over 25 years to reach [p. 899]. With the advent of microcomputers, User Services staff found themselves supporting not only new hardware, but also a whole new array of software that continues to expand. The proliferation of microcomputers leads to another challenge to User Services - decentralization of computing resources. There is no longer the traditional “Computer Center” that existed even 10 years ago. With the introduction of the microcomputer, the seat of computing power switched from the computer center to each person's desktop. According to the same survey mentioned above, the number of desktop microcomputers used in the schools surveyed has nearly doubled since 1985 [p. 909]. At University of Wisconsin -La Crosse, the number of microcomputers on campus reflects this trend, jumping from 245 in 1985 to 511 in 1988. While most campuses still support some mainframe usage, computing is usually accomplished at the user's office or home. Even those who use the mainframe are more likely to communicate via network or modem than by a terminal in the computer center. This decentralization means that users are no longer satisfied with traveling to a central site for consulting or restricting their questions to regular office hours. Instead they demand immediate answers to their questions without leaving their office. The nature of these questions is also changing. Many of the support questions addressed are not consulting on the use of the packages themselves, but rather involve identification of the best software for a particular purpose. While the development of “user-friendly” software means more people are inclined to try computing, many potential users find themselves overwhelmed by the myriad of hardware and software choices available. Whether novice or expert, users need help in identifying hardware and software that will meet their particular needs. As the availability of technology increases, so does the demand for consulting services. At the same time that more people are demanding more widely available services for more technology, time and money remain a problem for User Services groups. Service branches of the university have been traditionally understaffed and underbudgeted. Because of this shortage, most User Services groups are forced to rely on students in providing consulting to users. While this provides excellent experience for student workers, lack of training and poor communication with part-time workers too often result in inaccurate and inconsistent advice being given to users. This problem occurs most often in the area of hardware and software recommendations. Students tend to provide subjective opinions based on their own limited experience because they lack the broader knowledge required to give more objective advice. Better training would improve this situation somewhat, but knowledge acquisition and dissemination remain a problem because of the turnover rates inherent in use of student help.	advice (programming);computer hardware;desktop computer;expert system;knowledge acquisition;mainframe computer;microcomputer;minicomputer;modem;usability	E.

2fdadf8cf06ed24ab32a2dd2f77036063ec76f8b	the age of social sensing		Online social media, such as Twitter and Instagram, democratized information broadcast, allowing anyone to share information about themselves and their surroundings at an unprecedented scale. The large volume of information thus posted on these media offer a new lens into the physical world through the eyes of the social network. The exploitation of this lens to inspect aspects of world state has recently been termed social sensing. The power of manipulating reality via the use (or intentional misuse) of social media opened concerns with issues ranging from radicalization by terror propaganda to potential manipulation of elections in mature democracies. Many important challenges and open research questions arise in this emerging field that aims to better understand how information can be extracted from the medium and what properties characterize the extracted information and the world it represents. Addressing the above challenges requires multi-disciplinary research at the intersection of computer science and social sciences that combines cyber-physical computing, sociology, sensor networks, social networks, cognition, data mining, estimation theory, data fusion, information theory, linguistics, machine learning, behavioral economics, and possibly others. This paper surveys important directions in social sensing, identifies current research challenges, and outlines avenues for future research.

d4ed2670e6def78b532b7361dc1cff66752b1aa6	adaptability: reflections		The conclusion to be drawn from the preceding observations and theorizing should be that we must be very much aware of what has been called “technological functionalism” (Pieper, 1986:11). While functionalism as such is not bad, the moment it succumbs to mere structural technicality, the functions stop functioning: forced “adaptivity” takes the place of “adaptable” interaction. That this problem is not due to a primordial blame, to be attached to the computer, becomes clear when one compares the computerized environment to other surroundings, such as, for example, the psychiatric treatment. In the psychiatric interview, as Davis (1986, 1988) has shown, the interest of the therapist is often limited to establishing a “contract” for treatment: for the therapist to function properly, there must be a therapy-defined (or therapy-definable) problem for him/her to attack, using the skills and experiences of the profession of which he/she is a representative and for which he/she has been properly trained. This function, however, may not coincide with the patient's needs: it may well be the case that the problem which originally caused the patient to approach the therapist for treatment, in the end turns out not to be the problem that both agree on as the objective of the therapeutic treatment. “Re-formulating” the patients' problem in terms suitable to the available resources and techniques is thus typically a case of adapting the human to the system: again, we're faced with technological functionalism in the shape of what has been called “forced adaptivity” (see Mey, 1986). We need to think seriously about the way we handle our computerized structures and their functions, and in particular about the design of supportive systems such as large databases, computer conferencing, or even simple electronic mail services. While adaptivity always is a case of manipulation, by which humans are tooled to the needs and strictures of the computer, adaptability, by contrast, allows such manipulation only inasmuch as those needs and strictures reflect, and are imposed by, the users' needs. The blind, mechanical force that makes us adapt ourselves to the machine should be replaced by the enlightened, humanizing force of the adaptable computer.	amiga reflections;database;email;experience	Jacob L.

However, the psychological preparation necessary is often overlooked. This is a significant oversight, since acquiring the right mindset for an interview is not always intuitive and can make a big difference. Because it doesn't take that much time to prepare yourself psychologically for an interview, it can be a really high-leverage investment. At Box we are looking for game changers. So if you want to succeed in a Box interview, here are my five suggestions: 1. Be yourself. Box is a secure, scal-able content-sharing service for both users and enterprises. From early on we started paying attention to culture , which helped shape and build the awesome engineering team we have today. We don't only care what the person is capable of, but how they go about doing it. As Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh has pointed out, to build a tangible culture you really have to mean it and both hire and fire based on it. We take this concept to heart; we use every hire to grow and enrich our culture. We're encouraged to """" bring our wacky self to work every day. """" Let the real you come through during the interview so we can get to know you! 2. Remember the purpose of the interview. The goal of an interview at Box is to predict job performance (brain teasers are not correlated with coding performance). We try our best to choose interview questions that simulate the real work done at Box instead of puzzles or things you could look up on Google. Our most relevant company values are: """" Get stuff done. Fail fast. Iterate. """" Think about this during the interview and demonstrate that you can do it. 3. The interviewer wants you to succeed. Repeat this to yourself until you really believe it. Confidence is really important in interviews—not just because it creates a good impression but also because it allows you to perform your best. If you're nervous or worried, you'll slow down your brain. Especially when you're trying to do something requiring intellect or creativity. One of the obstacles to confidence is your perception of the interviewer. Are they helping you, or trying to trick you? Are they on your side? It's easy to feel threatened by an interviewer because they're asking tough …"""	awesome;fail-fast;intellect;iteration;simulation	Tomas Barreto	2014	ACM Crossroads	10.1145/2590533	simulation	HCI	-63.54133447614693	-24.473987362361456	195557

For those applications to succeed, researchers and developers must gain a thorough understanding of the needs of such applications and implement network equipment and interfaces to customer equipment that exploit the full potential of high-speed networks. A B-ISDN field trial network has been deployed in North Carolina as a multiservice testbed for advanced applications research and development.
