50f85c74462d614c167fe756e0036d3e69f6707e	tactical scheduling for precision air traffic operations: past research and current problems		Future air transportation systems stand to benefit significantly in safety and efficiency from the predictable movement of aircraft along precisely defined paths in the airspace. Such aircraft movement, hereafter referred to as Precision Air Traffic Operations (PATO), is not widely used during periods of peak air traffic in today’s system, but is the foundation of high-capacity operations envisioned for the future. Automation and deployment of PATO, being a relatively young field of research, has not had time to establish structured theories and standardized reference literature. As a consequence, researchers interested in entering this field have difficulty applying to it classical techniques of operations research and optimal control theory. The main obstacle to such applications is the lack of access to the finer domain knowledge of air traffic operations (most importantly, knowledge of the operational constraints) needed to formulate research problems that promise deployable automation tools. Such a formulation requires the researcher to characterize and assess the research efforts and tendencies that emerged in the recent decades to address diverse problems, some outwardly similar yet essentially different. The research field of PATO has now matured to a stage where this requirement can start being met. This paper, aimed as a step in this direction, provides (a) a formulation of the general problem of defining conceptually, constructing, and using a schedule for PATO that contains specification of merging sequences and provides aircraft separation continuously in time, (b) the context necessary for understanding the formulation and its limitations, and (c) a review of prior research on future Air Traffic Operations (ATO) and, in particular, on the role of Air Traffic Control (ATC) in these operations.	atm turbo;advanced tactical center;advanced transportation controller;approximation;automation;cns;computer science;control theory;critical section;diagram;emoticon;human factors and ergonomics;initial condition;mathematical optimization;multigraph;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;operations research;optimal control;perturbation theory;pilot ace;recommender system;robustness (computer science);scheduling (computing);schematic;simulation;software deployment;stochastic process	Douglas R.

3a52e053619c6a94d25f6de87a5dc06f46b6ef6a	aspekte einer perspektivischen ausrichtung für einen tragfähigen unternehmensmodellierungsprozess		To manage the evolution of the organisational structure and the ITsystems of an enterprise different kinds of models are used. Key to this paper is the observation that despite the promises and some elaborate approaches to corporate modelling, many organisations fail to implement a stable long-term activity to keep its models current. A number of influences are identified. Very important is the motivation of the involved persons, mostly the modellers and the support of their work. This comprises technical and organisational aspects. Many of the aspects are conflicting factors. After discussing them, a practical example is outlined and explained along the lines of the reasoning in the first chapters.	gesellschaft für informatik	Frank Wolff	2002			management science;organizational structure;business	HCI	-69.79713126547294	2.3697109119945625	152889

The reported study explores the nature of knowledge creation by domain practitioners who do not communicate directly. The focus of this paper extends the traditional view of a knowledge creation process beyond organisational boundaries. The proposed knowledge creation framework explains the facilitated process of knowledge creation by its qualification, combination, socialisation, externalisation, internalisation and introspection, thus allowing the transformation of individual experience and knowledge into formalised shareable domain knowledge.	data mining	Tanya Linden;Jacob L.

ab1057676be2aae3b242251f0c5f2c0bd679b66c	atira a/s : : breaking down silos with quality data relations - how pure enables uniform management reporting on top of cerif		Management reporting at universities has traditionally been a labour intensive exercise, trying to capture and link unstructured and often duplicate data across a wide range of systems including Finance, Costing, Research repositories, Students and HR. Here we present how Pure enables uniform reporting by linking and refining input from individual researchers or administrative staff with information already present within existing administrative systems in the CERIF data model. We will include best practices based on real-life examples. ___ Thomas Vestdam, PhD., M.Sc.SE Development Manager, Atira A/S Thomas Vestdam is the Manager of the Pure Platform and Pure GUI development teams in Atira, and as such manages the development of the Pure product.

024ebee3938c67f391a8ed99f9280b8f93f06509	semantic assistance nets	information structure;personal computer;digital communication;economic impact;object oriented;network management;ontological engineering	Improving the semantic level of the information handling provided by personal computers is likely to be a way both to use the increasing hardware capacities of these machines and to improve their economic impact. While this goal is widely recognized as abstractly desirable, it has not been clear how to accomplish it. This paper presents a design for organizing resources that are presently available, or that soon will be, to obtain systems that should provide significantly improved aids to understanding in fields where there is a substantial base of empirically verified information that involves nonnumeric relationships. Laboratory sciences appear to provide the fields with the greatest scope for such development at present, but there may also be opportunities to use such systems in investment and entrepreneurship. The resources to be assembled include frame-oriented databases and their associated ontological engineering organizations, high-bandwidth digital communications networks, microprocessor systems for vectorized numerical processing and object-oriented processing, larger units for these same purposes, high-capacity storage media, and network management software to coordinate the use of special hardware resources. The role of the personal computer in such a system will be as a combination of a vehicle for navigation through the information structures thus provided and as a node where information received over networks will be integrated with locally produced data. There have been many previous papers about topics related to those in this paper, but the focus of the present discussion is on integrating diverse information to outline the characteristics of the new systems, the prospect of successful development based on sound mathematical principles, and the specificity of the concept for important new fields of application.	database;frame language;information processing;microprocessor;numerical analysis;ontology engineering;organizing (structure);personal computer;sensitivity and specificity;telecommunications network	William David Miller	1990		10.1145/99412.99434	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;management science;automated information system	HPC	-65.14524847132091	3.7249296638278437	172720

Exchanges become highly relevant when we look at how collaborative processes are performed. A special emphasis is placed on enabling collaboration between multiple business partners. In most cases, companies require standardization of information flows and business processes to be able to collaborate. Here, trading platforms, private and public exchanges will play a much more important role due to their increased ease-of-use (as opposed to EDI for example). The key line of thought is that collaboration is essentially based on information sharing, information sharing enables exception management, exception management relies on near real-time data, and real-time data can be collected through wireless technologies. The key ideas of online marketplaces are discussed along with the evolution and future of exchanges in the digital economy, to help management rethink the exchange relationship in the digital economy. Introduction B2B is about connecting the existing buyer and sellers. It is not a disintermediation play. It is about intelligently implementing Internet technology to improve business processes. The online B2B market across the world is increasing in value rapidly, but there are some hurdles and limitations to be met in the near future. The report, from Strategy Analytics (an international research and consulting firm), notes that s global B2B e-commerce transactions will grow from $226 billion in 2001 to $2.02 trillion in 2006 [Bellomy 2002]. The B2B eCommerce revolution includes eProcurement, B2B exchanges, and business infrastructure relationships. eProcurement involves firms selling supplies, equipment, materials, and services with a streamlined online purchasing function that often eliminates traditional intermediaries, thereby reducing costs and cycle times while offering greater flexibility and responsiveness to changes in demand. Web-based supply chain management networks improve coordination between trading partners by linking a firm's forecasting and production planning systems with its suppliers' and distributors' systems. They can create dramatic savings and quality improvements. B2B exchanges include various categories of market spaces, including vertical market portals (""""vortals""""), hubs, and various types of auctions. A single Infomediary (industry consortium or 3rd party) brings together many buyers and sellers within a specific vertical market, such as plastics, steel, or industrial chemicals, charging a commission on all transactions. Hundreds of industry-specific exchanges have now been launched, and more are being developed every day. Some of these 'market spaces' operate with posted pricing models, while others employ collaborative negotiated prices, auctions, reverse auctions, Dutch auctions, and other pricing mechanisms. Many are used in spot markets for industrial materials, overstocks, and perishable goods, as well as business services transactions. More important is the development of entirely new eBusiness infrastructure industries. Many firms support online activity by facilitating the interaction between various parties in eCommerce as preferred outsourcers for eBusiness processes. They have become integral to the effective operation of Internet-based activities and may account for the largest source of profits from the future growth of eCommerce. They provide digital content or improve its delivery, bring new customers to websites, finance acquisitions, and provide many other services. They include application services providers, content maximizers, wireless service providers, and payment processors. The key questions addressed in this paper are: What does the exchange landscape look like in the digital economy and what can be inferred from the past to chart the direction and value proposition for the future? This Journal of Electronic Commerce Research, VOL. 3, NO. 2, 2002 Page 87 paper is structured as follows: Following this introduction, we will describe the characteristics and differentiators of online marketplaces followed by the evolution of e-marketplaces. In the next section we conduct an in-depth assessment of e-marketplaces and discuss event management and wireless-enabled exchanges. The concluding section tracks the transforming future of exchanges in the digital economy and provides a summary of the more general lessons, in terms of rethinking the exchange relationship in the digital economy. Online Marketplaces: Characteristics and Differentiators The possible forms of B2B marketplace are point-to-point connections (extranet), or e-marketplaces (Independent Trading Exchange (ITE)). As shown in figure 1, e-marketplaces can be either one-to-many or manyto-many environments. The key pricing mechanisms are fixed/static pricing (i.e., catalog-type/aggregator sales), and dynamic/variable pricing which includes both exchanges and auctions where price is negotiated in real time. An auction is one buyer and many sellers, or one seller and many buyers, whereas an exchange is many buyers and many sellers. However, caution is advised since almost everything is calling itself an exchange. Most are simply catalogs where buyers can search across multiple suppliers.

Therefore, ever-growing pressure imposed on the ex isting mass transit systems calls for a better technology, I ntelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), to solve many new and dem anding management issues. Many studies in the extant ITS literature attempted to address these issues within which v arious research methodologies were adopted. However, ther e is very few paper summarized what does optimal control theory ( OCT), one of the sharpest tools to tackle management issues in engineering, do in solving these issues. It’s both import ant and interesting to answer the following two questions. ( 1) How does OCT contribute to ITS research objectives? (2) What are he research gaps and possible future research directions? We searched 11 top transportation and control journa ls and reviewed 41 research articles in ITS area in which OCT was used as the main research methodology. We categorized th e articles by four different ways to address our research questions. We can conclude from the review that OCT is widely used to address various aspects of management issues in ITS within which a large portion of the studies aimed to reduc e traffic congestion. We also critically discussed these stu dies and pointed out some possible future research directions to wards which OCT can be used.	apache ant (another neat tool);categorization;control theory;network congestion;optimal control	Jimmy S.

The rapid spread of ubiquitous networks, and connected sensors such as those contained in smartphones and cars, allow these networks to be reinvented as much more active and reactive control networks at the scale of the individual, the family, the enterprise, the city and the nation. This will fundamentally transform the economics of health, finance, logistics, and transportation. One key challenge is access to the personal data at scale to enable these systems to function more efficiently. In discussions with key CEOs, regulators, and NGOs at the World Economic Forum we have constructed a ‘new deal on data’ that can allow personal data to emerge as accessible asset class that provides strong protection for individuals. The talk will also cover a range of prototype systems and experiments developed at MIT, outline some of the challenges and growth opportunities, focusing on how this new data ecosystem may end up strongly promoting but also shaping the semantic web.	centralized computing;ecosystem;experiment;logistics;noise shaping;personally identifiable information;prototype;semantic web;sensor;smartphone	Alex Pentland	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-25093-4_34	semantic web;new deal;knowledge extraction;computer science;finance	Mobile	-68.57538259281834	-2.5283812037430855	187587

Yet the practice itself and the output is still questionable in regards of its safety. For the modern era a reliable way is open for productive organic farming practices through the adoption of technology. No questions on biotechnology and its outputs are analyzed here. New breakthroughs can be made in the field of modern agricultural practices through technology aided organic farming. Various modern organic farming practices and new aspects for efficient large scale organic crop cultivation methods are discussed. Some proposals are also made in this work.		P. J.

Given this apparent relationship of information and knowledge it is tempting to apply computer-based information management techniques, such as information retrieval and information filtering, to the management of knowledge as well. A closer look, however, reveals that the effectiveness of computer-based tools is already limited in the information management domain. In order to circumvent similar limitations in the knowledge management domain, we suggest considering humans as scaffolding minds and applying tools in such a way that human cognitive and social capabilities are supported. Examples discussed range from social navigation and collaborative filtering to support for virtual communities of practice.	collaborative filtering;information filtering system;information management;information needs;information retrieval;knowledge management;mind;virtual community	Christopher Peter Lueg	2001	J.
