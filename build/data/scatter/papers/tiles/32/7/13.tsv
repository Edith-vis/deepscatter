However,the FCC performed even more groundbreaking activity. The FCC wasgiven wide latitude by the Act to interpret the universal serviceprovisions of the Act either narrowly or broadly; the FCC chose thelatter. The FCC's interpretation of the Act will have a significantimpact on the level of technology implementation and use inAmerican classrooms and libraries. In March 1996, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(NPRM) on Universal Service. The NPRM also established aFederal-State Joint Board composed of three FCC Commissioners (theChairman and two commissioners), four state public servicecommission representatives nominated by the National Association ofRegulatory Utility Commissioners, and one utility consumer advocatenominated by the National Association of State Utility ConsumerAdvocates. On November 8, 1996, the Joint Board released itsRecommended Decision and the FCC adopted its rules based on thatrecommendation in May 1997. The FCC ruled that all eligible schools and libraties shouldreceive discounts of between 20 and 90 percent (depending on need)on all telecommunications services, Internet access, and internalconnections, subject to a $2.25 billion annual cap. In addition,any funds not disbursed in a given year may be carried forward anddisbursed in subsequent years without regard to the cap. Thisprovision, according to the FCC, will provide schools and librarieswith the maximum flexibility to purchase the services that willmeet their communications needs most effectively. In a separatesection of the rules, the FCC defined """"core services"""" as: &bull; Voice-grade access to the public switched network,with the ability to place and receive calls &bull; Dual Tone Multifrequency signaling (touch-tone) orits functional equivalent &bull; Single-party service &bull; Access to emergency services &bull; Access to operator services &bull; Access to interexchange services &bull; Access to directory assistance. &bull; Support for toll limitation services (includes bothtoll blocking and toll control) for low-income consumers. However, as stated in the Act, the FCC was given the latitude toinclude additional services for schools and libraries. It couldhave chosen to provide schools and libraries with discounts on (1)only core telecommunications services; (2) core services plus somecomplement of additional services; or (3) all telecommunicationsservices (including wireless). The FCC adopted the third option,that discounts be provided on all telecommunications services. Itstated that this guideline would provide schools and libraries themaximum flexibility to purchase whatever package oftelecommunications services they believe would meet theirtelecommunications service needs most effectively andefficiently. <i>Current Status:</i> The FCC ruled that it willpermit schools to begin using discounted services on January 1,1998. The presentation will discuss the current status of thislegislation."""	blocking (computing);cell signaling;directory (computing);dual-tone multi-frequency signaling;internet access;library (computing)	Patricia Figliola Lewis	1998		10.1145/276755.276766	rule-based system;public relations;economics;internet access;computer science;artificial intelligence;marketing;operations management;law;computer security	Web+IR	-69.49452481376665	-14.398731956736947	160516

The paper proposes the drafting of a European Regulation in the field of ODR that would set legal standards for mandatory ODR. The proposed Regulation would create a pan-European trustmark that would be granted to those ODR providers that comply with its legal provisions. Compliance would be monitored by the co-operation between national and regional authorities through the European Consumer Centres Network (ECC-Net). The ECC-Net national offices and online businesses would refer national and cross-border disputes to accredited ODR providers. The proposed Regulation would encourage the use of consensual ODR processes as a step previous to the adjudicative processes for all accredited and mandatory ODR.

4782a6fd268e5a3ef03fd3c4965feb4da01c59e0	acm fellows		The ACM Fellows Program was established by Council in 1993 to recognize and honor outstanding ACM members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the ACM. The ACM Fellows serve as distinguished colleagues to whom the ACM and its members look for guidance and leadership as the world of information technology evolves. The ACM Council endorsed the establishment of a Fellows Program and provided guidance to the ACM Fellows Committee, taking the view that the program represents a concrete benefit to which any ACM Member might aspire, and provides an important source of role models for existing and prospective ACM Members. The program is managed by an ACM Fellows Committee as part of the general ACM Awards program administered by Calvin C. Gotlieb. The men and women honored as ACM Fellows have made critical contributions towards and continue to exhibit extraordinary leadership in the development of the Information Age and will be inducted at the ACM Awards Banquet on May 6, 2000 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. These new inductees bring the total number of ACM Fellows to 384 (see www.acm.org/awards/fellows/, for a listings of the previously inducted ACM Fellows). Their works span all horizons in computer science and information technology: from the theoretical realms of numerical analysis, combinatorial mathematics and algorithmic complexity analysis; through provinces of computer architecture, integrated circuits and firmware spanning personal computer to supercomputer design: into the limitless world of software and networking that makes computer systems work and produces solutions and results that are useful—and fun—for people everywhere. Their technical papers, books, university courses, computing programs and hardware for the emerging computer/communications amalgam reflect the powers of their vision and their ability to inspire colleagues and students to drive the field forward. The members of the ACM are all participants in building the runways, launching pads and vehicles of the global information infrastructure.

413882fe50bb6c51b7ce813459825b64277a1da0	mining history of gamification towards finding expertise in question and answering communities: experience and practice with stack exchange		Recently, an online Q&A tool has become an essential part of individual communities and organizations of experts on specific topics. Using the answers to questions about specific topics will help such communities work more efficiently in their fields. Currently, Q&A online communities are adopting gamification to engage users by granting awards to successful users. In this paper, we investigate how to mine award achievement histories to find expertise. We propose the use of sequence analysis and clustering techniques. Specifically, we study the history of Stack Exchange, a large Q&A community that employs gamification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of using award achievement history to find expertise in Q&A communities.	cluster analysis;gamification;online community;rev;sequence analysis;stack exchange;stack overflow;user (computing)	Patanamon Thongtanunam;Raula Gaikovina Kula;Ana Erika Camargo Cruz;Norihiro Yoshida;Kohei Ichikawa;Hajimu Iida	2013	The Review of Socionetwork Strategies	10.1007/s12626-013-0038-0	knowledge management;data mining;world wide web	Web+IR	-65.2222288140699	-16.188322490983662	161552

The document, 60 pages long plus an introduction, lays out five cybersecurity priorities (see sidebar on page 9) for both the private and public sectors. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will be responsible for coordinating communications between the federal government and critical private-sector centers on cybersecurity issues. However, some security experts and analysts say the document does not add tangible steps toward better securing the nation’s communications networks and computer infrastructure. It is short on details and contains no enforcement provisions. Nor are many of those responsible for explaining how the DHS and the private sector will form effective communications willing or able to answer questions about those details. A DHS spokesman, after receiving numerous requests over a threeweek span for an interview, said the department would not be able to comment. “We’re just getting our personnel into place,” he said. This hesitance to expand on the document’s generalities does not bode well for its implementation, says Bruce Schneier, cofounder of Counterpane Internet Security and author of Applied Cryptography. If the federal government is unable to comment on an already released document, he says it is a sign that perhaps not enough advance planning has been done or not enough follow through is probable. “They don’t care about this anymore,” Schneier says. “I’ve been arguing this for a long time, that they’ve been paying lip service to this. It’s a PR document, not a security document. The fact they’re not doing interviews makes it sound like I was right. This is, like, the fourth one of these documents we’ve seen. Every administration comes up with their document, we all read it and go ‘Wow,’ and then we all go about our business.”	bt managed security solutions;bode plot;computer security;cryptography;federal government;internet security;national strategy to secure cyberspace;probability;telecommunications network	Greg Goth	2003	IEEE Security & Privacy Magazine	10.1109/MSECP.2003.1203215	certified information security manager;cloud computing security;web application security;critical security studies;security through obscurity;national strategy to secure cyberspace;security information and event management;computer science;threat;information security;national security;security service;terrorism;world wide web;computer security;government;information security management	Security	-69.9478484604414	-11.769030630402998	166433

These developments have perhaps the greatest opportunities in the field of geographic information. Although the Directive on the re-use of public sector information (PSI Directive) was specifically drafted to address the needs of re-users , the Directive establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) is equally important for re-use of public sector information regarding the physical environment. INSPIRE requirements promote that geographic information, concerning 34 spatial reference and various environmental themes, can be found and is physically attainable on the Internet. With the requirement to provide datasets and service metadata, the obligation to conform to INSPIRE data specifications, and the requirement to do this through discovery, view, and download services, INSPIRE makes a significant contribution to the re-usability of public sector information.	directive (programming);download;infrastructure for spatial information in the european community;internet;requirement;spatial reference system;usability	Bastiaan van Loenen;Michel Grothe	2014	IJSDIR		public relations;engineering;knowledge management;data mining	Web+IR	-70.02120451280545	-16.234261997154707	166862

Kudo Y. Araki H. Nomiyama S. Saito Y. Sohda Recent incidents involving the loss of personal information and identity theft have raised concerns worldwide over information privacy. In Japan, the Personal Information Protection Act went into effect in April 2005, requiring every enterprise to manage sensitive personal information on servers, workstations, and personal computers throughout the organization. This paper describes two tools we developed to assist in the management of personal information, aDesigner and the Personal Information Detection (PID) tool. The aDesigner tool scans an entire Web site to determine if each HTML page complies with the IBM privacy guidelines for external Web sites. PID is capable of automatically identifying ‘‘named entities,’’ such as personal names, addresses, or telephone numbers in the textual parts of target files based on Japanese morphological analysis technology. This paper also summarizes the best practices used in IBM Japan for privacy management and presents statistical results concerning personal information gathered through deployment of these tools.	best practice;html;information privacy;itakura–saito distance;named entity;pid;personal information protection and electronic documents act;personal computer;personally identifiable information;server (computing);software deployment;telephone number;workstation	Michiharu Kudo;Yoshio Araki;Hiroshi Nomiyama;Shin Saito;Yukihiko Sohda	2007	IBM Systems Journal	10.1147/sj.462.0235	personally identifiable information;privacy policy;identity theft;information privacy;morphological analysis;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;operating system;software engineering;personal information management;group information management;database;internet privacy;personal knowledge management;management;world wide web;computer security;personal information manager;best practice	OS	-68.71715038277279	-10.364213147516756	167269

9731e8a5415ed8459716818a18cda4df5efb845f	overview of cyber science and technology programs at the u.s. army research laboratory		The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) received the first salvos in the battle for cybersecurity as early as three decades ago. In terms of technology history, it was an astonishingly long time ago. Before most people ever heard of the Internet. Before there were web browsers. Long before the smartphones. Back in 1986, the laboratory withstood attacks by Markus Hess, a Soviet-sponsored hacker who had successfully penetrated dozens of U.S. military computer sites. In his bestselling book, The Cuckoo’s Egg, the pioneering U.S. cyber defender, Cliff Stoll, describes how he monitored the hacker’s networks activities in the fall of 1986: “He then tried the Army’s Ballistic Research Lab’s computers in Aberdeen, Maryland. The Milnet took only a second to connect, but BRL’s passwords defeated him: he couldn’t get through” (Stoll 1989).	computer security;internet;markus hess;military computers;password;smartphone;the cuckoo's egg	Alexander Kott	2017	CoRR		operations research;computer security	Security	-68.85722536280447	-11.220665144627771	168480

(transcript of discussion)	branch banking system;different password;different building;various thing;different lady;security economics;swift password;federated authentication;various place;db2 password;racf password	There has been much academic discussion of federated authentication, and quite some political manoeuvring about ‘e-ID’. The grand vision, which has been around for years in various forms but was recently articulated in the US National Strategy for Trustworthy Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), is that a single logon should work everywhere [1]. You should be able to use your identity provider of choice to log on anywhere; so you might use your driver’s license to log on to Gmail, or use your Facebook logon to file your tax return. More restricted versions include the vision of governments of places like Estonia and Germany (and until May 2010 the UK) that a government-issued identity card should serve as a universal logon. Yet few systems have been fielded at any scale. In this paper I will briefly discuss the four existing examples we have of federated authentication, and then go on to discuss a much larger, looming problem. If the world embraces the Apple vision of your mobile phone becoming your universal authentication device—so that your phone contains half-a dozen credit cards, a couple of gift cards, a dozen coupons and vouchers, your AA card, your student card and your driving license, how will we manage all this? A useful topic for initial discussion, I argue, is revocation. Such a phone will become a target for bad guys, both old and new.

d62ce1d63ff575ab303c4c764190f4bd1b5db8d6	life3: a predictive costing tool for digital collections		Predicting the costs of long-term digital preservation is a crucial yet complex task for even the largest repositories and institutions. For smaller projects and individual researchers faced with preservation requirements, the problem is even more overwhelming, as they lack the accumulated experience of the former. Yet being able to estimate future preservation costs is vital to answering a range of important questions for each. The LIFE (Life Cycle Information for E-Literature) project, which has just completed its third phase, helps institutions and researchers address these concerns, reducing the financial and preservation risks, and allowing decision makers to assess a range of options in order to achieve effective preservation while operating within financial restraints. The project is a collaboration between University College London (UCL), The British Library and the Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute (HATII) at the University of Glasgow. Funding has been supplied in the UK by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and the Research Information Network (RIN).	case preservation;humanities advanced technology and information institute;information systems;relative intensity noise;requirement;software repository	Brian Hole;Paul Wheatley;Li Lin;Patrick McCann	2010			management science;information system;activity-based costing;digital preservation;business	OS	-68.72484888431744	-15.847495409013678	169120

Yet despite all of this attention, there is some confusion about what is actually encompassed by those terms. There are some obvious components, such as cryptography and access control. However, the list of undisputed topics is not long or well-developed, and many questions arise as to whether a typical computer science department can offer all of the topics involved. That there are only a few universities that teach a comprehensive curriculum in these topics serves to illustrate the imprecise nature of the field. Many professionals have taken to describing it as """"information security"""" or """"information assurance"""" to distinguish that the focus is not on computers and networks, but on the information they hold and process.This talk will present a more comprehensive view of the area than simply within the confines of CS/CE. The speaker has been teaching information security for nearly 20 years and has developed a view that spans many traditional disciplines. The talk will present some of the reasons for that breadth of view, illustrated with examples taken from the recent CRA Grand Challenges Conference on Information Security. One conclusion from this talk is that getting good information security education widely implemented may not be simple, given current constraints and traditions within academia."""	access control;computer science;credit bureau;cryptography;cybercrime;cyberterrorism;grand challenges;information assurance;information privacy;information security;network security	Eugene H.

Investors buy and sell stocks there. Regulators are in place to offer a fair place for trading. Unfortunately, market manipulation of different forms still exists. Limited researches worked on this area due to restriction in data supply. Exchanges and regulators do not offer full order book to the public. Without a full order book, it is difficult to locate the fraud intention of manipulator. This paper introduces a new method to identify suspicious cases: identifying suspicious cases by parsing the stock recommendation news written by stock commentators. Some suspicious cases are found in the study.

In 2003, after a century, new excavations were undertaken every year and each time for a month. All the elements, collected as well at the time of the first excavations as during the most recent ones, enabled archeologists to build a documented corpus to create digital models of one of the Bawit site church, called the North Church. Those digital models were used as elements for a public communication in seven small or medium-sized exhibitions in France and in Spain. This short presentation (10 minutes) is showed onto screen among the objects, sculptures and fabrics from Bawit or other Coptic sites. This presentation enabled us to conduct a visitor survey trying to know better the visitor's expectations about the use of digital reconstitutions of heritage places, as well as possible devices allowing a better understanding of the archeological heritage and the place spirit. This paper deals with the results of the survey and gives a possible overview of the perspectives for presentations of archeological sites.	digital rights management;interactivity;relevance;text corpus;virtual tour	Sahar Ghaderi;Olivier Bouet	2012	2012 18th International Conference on Virtual Systems and Multimedia	10.1109/VSMM.2012.6365900	cultural heritage;archaeology;tourism	HCI	-65.3316648589162	-12.633443003840695	177312

Central to this are complex processes of delegation — in which organizational work and agency are passed back and forth across the shifting line between “social” and “technical” elements. Building on work in the sociology of science, this paper extends the concept of delegation and applies it to thorny questions around the work of sustaining organization over time. We explore two examples from the Open Science Grid (OSG), an initiative that distributes computational resources to geographically dispersed and otherwise loosely coordinated research teams. Our first case is one of successful delegation, as automated access to resources is extended to a new group of distributed scientists.We then turn our attention to a case where the process of delegation breaks down, revealing the usually invisible work needed to sustain “seamless” integration. As these cases show, delegation is complex, fragile, and central to the nature of contemporary organizing. Specifically, delegation: 1) reconfigures the organization of work; 2) transforms how outcomes are accomplished; 3) redistributes responsibility for organizational decision-making; and 4) shifts the visibility and invisibility of both actors and their work. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

4f9ddeff3b2e8954648c57a8abef936b424cdb01	update from southeast asia: chiuxid 2017		"""We will first have a two-day conference in Jakarta, which will consist of keynote presentations, participative presentations from academia and industry, poster and demo sessions, design challenges, workshops, and business networking sessions. In the last two days, we will go to rural areas and conduct a series of outreach design workshops with the villagers. We will engage them in a design thinking process in their natural settings to creatively think about contextualized solutions to improve their lives. This year it is an honor to have key ACM SIGCHI members and renowned speakers joining us. Henky Prihatna (Google, Indonesia) will inspire us with their acclaimed work in research and industry. We look forward to seeing more and more of the ACM SIGCHI community be part of this premier HCI and UX outreach effort in Indonesia. Eunice Sari is the CEO and co-founder of UX Indonesia (uxindo.com), ACM SIGCHI Southeast Asia Liason, and a Google Expert in UX/UI. Adi (Josh) Tedjasaputra is the director and co-founder of UX Indonesia (uxindo.com) and an expert in user experience, the Internet of Things, and digital technology. Tuomo Kujala (Ed.) is ACM SIGCHI vice president for chapters. → sigchi-VP-chapters@acm.org C HI UX Indonesia started in early 2014 on the initiative of Eunice Sari and Adi Tedjasaputra. As we embarked on the journey of getting ACM SIGCHI to support the formation of the first HCI and UX community in Indonesia, we organized a kick-off event, UX Indonesia-Malaysia 2014, with support from ACM SIGCHI in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. This effort resulted in the formation of the Indonesian ACM SIGCHI Chapter; since then, we have witnessed a lot of progress and growth in our community over the past three years. In April 2016, we successfully held the second CHIuXiD conference in Jakarta; it was the only ACM in Cooperation conference in the Southeast Asia region dedicated to leaders, experts, academics, and professionals in HCI and UX. Indonesia has the world's fourth-largest population of Facebook users, and Jakarta is the world's most active Twitter city, recently becoming one of the most popular target markets for world leaders in digital technology. The annual conference organized by CHI UX Indonesia has made a significant difference in the regional HCI and UX landscape.

1845f003bd517be097550052eb7774408449d649	share our cultural heritage (soch): worldwide 3d heritage reconstruction and visualization via web and mobile gis		Despite being of paramount importance to humanity, tangible cultural heritage is often at risk from natural and anthropogenic threats worldwide. As a result, heritage discovery and conservation remain a huge challenge for both developed and developing countries, with heritage sites often inadequately cared for, be it due to a lack of resources, nonrecognition of the value by local people or authorities, human conflict, or some other reason. This paper presents an online geo-crowdsourcing system, termed Share Our Cultural Heritage (SOCH), which can be utilized for large-scale heritage documentation and sharing. Supported by web and mobile GIS, cultural heritage data such as textual stories, locations, and images can be acquired via portable devices. These data are georeferenced and presented to the public via web-mapping. Using photogrammetric modelling, acquired images are used to reconstruct heritage structures or artefacts into 3D digital models, which are then visualized on the SOCH web interface to enable public interaction. This end-to-end system incubates an online virtual community to encourage public engagement, raise awareness, and stimulate cultural heritage ownership. It also provides valuable resources for cultural heritage exploitation, management, education, and monitoring over time.		Hari K. Dhonju;Wen Xiao;Jon P. Mills;Vasilis Sarhosis	2018	ISPRS Int. J.

The 2010 Research Paper Award discusses the documentation of the Los Angeles Chapter of ASIS&T upon the occasion of its semicentennial year of activities. The Chapter's founding in 1961 reflected the aim of information scientists to share developments and research across the region for the purposes of continuing education. Mirroring trends across the professional landscape nationally, this Chapter's and others' programs have made unique contributions and fostered local understanding of both practical and strategic issues arising from advancements in information access and technology. These Awards are organized by the ASIS&T Special Interest Group on History & Foundations of Information Science (SIG HFIS).	software documentation	Sarah A.

210feebec03a4f9c7ca9ec8adcc530e2c4e68a74	digitizing early farming cultures customizing the arches heritage inventory & management system		The aims of the project `Digitizing Early Farming Cultures' (DEFC) are to create standardized and integrated research data of Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites and finds of Greece and Anatolia (c. 7000-3000 BC according to Greek terminology), two neighbouring and archaeologically closely related regions usually studied in isolation of each other. The data will be made available open access online ensuring compliance to standards in data production for data sharing (metadata and mappings) and interoperability with related initiatives. In this paper we will present first results of the project. Based on focus group meetings and analysis of our resources we created a conceptual data model for a site database. We will implement the data structure into the Arches Heritage Inventory & Management System and extend the Arches CIDOC CRM graph for the mapping of our data.	conceptual schema;data model;data structure;focus group;interoperability;management system	Edeltraud Aspöck;Anja Masur	2015	2015 Digital Heritage	10.1109/DigitalHeritage.2015.7419549	systems engineering;engineering;operations management;multimedia	DB	-67.85887610072396	-16.48814591954914	183496
13ab81ce5893da503cfd21df5ac96be10146dbf9	applying java-triggers for x-link management in the industrial framework	user needs;life cycle;activation function;integrated management;multi user	"""This chapter focuses on referential link integrity problems. In the industrial context, the life cycle of a document plays a central role in describing the “steps out” of a product. Users realize some manipulations like creation, edition, suppression and querying under a multi-user environment, risking possible destruction or the alteration of the document’s integrity. A classical impact is the infamous “Error 404: file not found.” However, the user needs a notification alert mechanism to prevent and warrant the coherence of manipulations over all the life cycle processes of a product. The main objective of this chapter is to provide a generic relationship validation mechanism to remedy this shortcoming. We believe in the combination of some standard features of XML, specifically XLL specification as a support for integrity management and JavaTriggers approach as an alert method. This study, compared with actual approaches, proposes a solution based on active functionalities. 701 E.

INTRODUCTION The business contributions of intranet applications have proven that this technology is a golden approach to support corporate Web-based systems (as stated in Balasubramanian et al., 1997, 1998). Increasing in number, all kinds of organizations are taking advantage of intranets to propagate structured documentation (e.g., technical, medical, academic, etc.). Intranet technology is well used to enhance organizations’ business strategies (Bonifatti, 2000). The current Web and intranet services are short of referential integrity support. In this study, the coherence problem means that a link depends on the “state” of the referenced document. When documents are edited or revised, locations can probably be altered, with the potential risk of destroying the record of a linked text. Observable examples are broken links and dangling references, arguably two of the most unwanted problems in distributed domains. Another frequent problem is resource migration. Experience has shown that Web resources often “migrate” during the reorganization of hardware resources (e.g., as a result of an increase in the volume of information published by a given site). The question is how to preserve the link integrity when, at any time, document links can be altered in some way, with the potential risk of destroying the record of a linked text (broken links). The main purpose of this chapter is to provide a generic relationship validation mechanism to keep the link references in a “coherent state” over all processes involved. It proposes a solution based on active functionalities. Our approach is based both on the definition of ECA rules and Java-Triggers Technology; the rules are used as alert mechanisms. Therefore, some standard features of XML, highlighted in the XLL specifications (X-link and X-pointer) presented by the XML-Linking working group, will be considered in this work as a support for integrity management. BACKGROUND In the literature we have found several research and development projects addressed to referential link integrity problem; two main categories of solutions have been proposed: preventive and corrective solutions (Ashman, 1999, 2000). Preventive Solutions • Forbidding changes: is a preventive strategy, the modification of documents is not authorized (Thistlewaite, 1995). Links pointing to documents or part of documents should not fail. This approach does not provide a protection in cases where the host information is changed. Addressed to link update problem only. • Versioning: is one of the main issues in the hypermedia field adopted by Vitali (1999) and Nelson (Theodor, 1999). The changes in the document are permitted by the creation of a newer version and are notified to the reader. Thus, the document changes as new versions become the active document. In summary, versioning provides an easy and safe solution to the well-know problem of referential link integrity. 19 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/chapter/applying-java-triggers-linkmanagement/9209?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Books, InfoSci-Database Technologies, Library Science, Information Studies, and Education, InfoSci-Library and Information Science, InfoSciComputer Science and Information Technology, Science, Engineering, and Information Technology, InfoSci-Select, InfoSci-Select.

A number of general strategies can be identified, characterised and applied to many situations; these strategies may be combined to produce robust preservation solutions tailored to the needs of the community and responsive to their environment. This paper provides an overview of this approach. We describe the components of a Preservation Network Model and go on to show how it may be used to plan preservation actions according to the requirements of the particular situation using illustrative examples from scientific archives.

Using web conferencing for IEEE conferences has a good potential of adding value to both organizers and participants. Authors propose a concept of Truly Integrated Conference (TIC) according to which a multi-point worldwide-distributed network of conference online authors/participants will enhance the standard (centralized) IEEE conference model, which requires attendance of the participants in person at the main conference location. The concept entails seamless integration of the onsite and online conference systems, including data/presentation, video, audio channels. Benefits and challenges of the TIC concept are analyzed. Requirements to the web conferencing system capable of supporting the TIC conference are presented and reviewed against commercial web conferencing tools. Case study of the IEEE Toronto International Conference – Science and Technology for Humanity, which was the first realization of TIC, is presented which analyzes various aspects (organizational, technological, and financial) of the integrated conference.	centralized computing;requirement;seamless3d	Alexei Botchkarev;Lian Zhao;Hamed Rasouli	2010	CoRR		simulation;human–computer interaction;telecommunications;computer science;multimedia;world wide web;science, technology and society	Visualization	-63.79863086026782	-15.321613727206735	190559

However, in a historical twist, international legal scrutiny of cyber operations emerged and developed precisely through the optics of the law of war. This paper analyses the influence that the development of the cyber law of war has had and might yet have on the ‘core’ of international law, in other words, on general international law. It analyses three key dimensions of the relationship between the law of war and general international law: systemic, conceptual, and teleological. It argues that, firstly, a systemic-level shift has taken place in the discourse, resulting in the academic debate and state focus moving from law-of-war questions to questions of general international law including sovereignty, non-intervention, and state responsibility. A better understanding of this trend should allay the fears of fragmentation of international law and inform the debate about the relationship between the law of war and ‘core’ international law. Secondly, this development has created fertile grounds for certain concepts to migrate from the law of war, where they had emerged, developed or consolidated, into general international law. A case in point is the functionality test, which originated as a compromise solution to determine whether a cyber operation amounts to an ‘attack’ under the law of war, but which may offer additional utility in other areas of international law including the law of state sovereignty and the law of arms control and disarmament. Thirdly, however, it is imperative that the unique teleological underpinning of the law of war is taken into consideration before introducing its rules and principles to different Kubo Mačák Law School University of Exeter Exeter, United Kingdom k.macak@exeter.ac.uk 2017 9th International Conference on Cyber Conflict	ana (programming language);backdrop cms;coat of arms;computer security;cyberspace;fork (software development);gene regulatory network;graham scan;imperative programming;interference (communication);malware;markov blanket;schmitt trigger;vanishing point	Kubo Macak	2017		10.23919/CYCON.2017.8240333	international law;computer science;normative;law and economics;internet privacy;state responsibility;disarmament;sovereignty;arms control;law of war;transplantation	Arch	-68.0455335247878	-11.525501065681054	196036

A preliminary Defense Department report found that Hughes Electronics gave China potentially damaging information after a Chinese rocket carrying a Hughes-built satellite crashed in 1995. After satellites belonging to Hughes and Loral were destroyed in two Chinese rocket explosions, Hughes asked for and received permission from the Commerce Department to discuss its views on what happened, although the company was told to be careful not to disclose rocketry data that could assist Beijing in developing military missiles. In the preliminary report the Pentagon concluded that Hughes “went well beyond what should have been allowed” when it told China the crash was caused by problems with the rockets’ fairings. Hughes maintains its conversations with the Chinese were very general.	pentagon	Robert Fox	1999	Commun. ACM	10.1145/293411.293415		HCI	-68.55841974067357	-11.835601559550016	198025
