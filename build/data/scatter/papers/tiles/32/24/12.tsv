In the first step the safest areas in the environment are extracted by means of a Voronoi diagram. In the second step fast marching method is applied to the Voronoi extracted areas in order to obtain the shortest path. In this way the trajectory obtained is the shortest between the safe possible ones.

The designed strategy is a 5-tuple and mainly contains: 1) state space; 2) action space; 3) state transfer function, meaning the consequence after action; 4) tendency function; 5) action selection strategy, adjusting the selected probability of each action. The designed bionic strategy is applied to motion control of snake robot. The experiment analysis is carried out combined with Webots robot simulation software. The results of the simulation experiment indicate that the skill of autonomous optimisation adjustment control parameters will gradually be enhanced with the learning proceeding.	action selection;algorithm;autonomous robot;coefficient;mathematical optimization;simulation software;state space;transfer function	Jianxian Cai;Ao Dun;Ruihong Yu	2013	IJMIC	10.1504/IJMIC.2013.055432	control engineering;motion control;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;operant conditioning;control theory;robot control;snakebot	Robotics	60.599793969340205	-23.562301413674952	160721

Efficient neighbor finding techniques in tree structures are required for such models to be used properly, especially for path planning and collision avoidance. In this paper, an optimized neighbor finding approach is presented that is based on a recursive addressing scheme which precludes any backtracking into the tree structure while preserving model compactness. Neighboring cell addresses are computed directly given a displacement direction in 3-D space and the address of the starting cell. Neighboring rule sets that have been previously derived for a quadtree representation are now extended to octrees. Given the algebraic rules that are defined, computation of a neighboring cell address in an octree comes down to basic arithmetic operations with carry. The algorithm complexity is kept low in order to provide good performances.	addressing scheme;algorithm;backtracking;computation;displacement mapping;linear algebra;motion planning;octree;performance;quadtree;recursion;robotics;tree structure	Pierre Payeur	2004	2004 IEEE Symposium on Virtual Environments, Human-Computer Interfaces and Measurement Systems, 2004.

07ca5e8dff09c544bf84322a0a77b308c1c6610f	formation control using gq(λ) reinforcement learning		Formation control is an important subtask for autonomous robots. From flying drones to swarm robotics, many applications need their agents to control their group behavior. Especially when moving autonomously in humanrobot teams, motion and formation control of a group of agents is a critical and challenging task. In this work, we propose a method of applying the GQ(λ) reinforcement learning algorithm to a leader-follower formation control scenario on the e-puck robot platform. In order to allow control via classical reinforcement learning, we present how we modeled a formation control problem as a Markov decision making process. This allows us to use the Greedy-GQ(λ) algorithm for learning a leader-follower control law. The applicability and performance of this control approach is investigated in simulation as well as on real robots. In both experiments, the followers are able to move behind the leader. Additionally, the algorithm improves the smoothness of the follower's path online, which is beneficial in the context of human-robot interaction.	augmented assignment;autonomous robot;consensus dynamics;e-puck mobile robot;experiment;greedy algorithm;humans;human–robot interaction;machine learning;markov chain;optimal control;organizing (structure);reinforcement learning;requirement;self-organization;simulation;swarm robotics	Martin Knopp;Can Aykin;Johannes Feldmaier;Hao Shen	2017	2017 26th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)	10.1109/ROMAN.2017.8172432	machine learning;simulation;robot;computer science;swarm robotics;decision-making;reinforcement learning;markov chain;artificial intelligence	Robotics	56.30452720669889	-22.169325020894853	161185

When the robots enter the required formation, there exists the formation-structure constraint, which causes disorder or even deadlock of the formation. A dynamic priority strategy is developed to solve the problem of the formation-structure constraint, and coordinate the robots to form the formation in a proper order. Simulations are performed on a group of mobile robots to demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy to the formation system.	computer simulation;deadlock;mobile robot;motion planning	Shuang Liu;Dong Sun;Changan Zhu;Wen Shang	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354715	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;motion planning	Robotics	58.08036993012009	-23.446078567226305	161293
530590abb906c81a3e3bb1bf9787eff1e810fb13	a differential game theoretic approach for two-agent collision avoidance with travel limitations	tecnologia industrial tecnologia mecanica;tecnologia electronica telecomunicaciones;game theory;automated vehicle control;pedestrian safety;poison control;injury prevention;safety literature;traffic safety;injury control;home safety;collision avoidance systems;injury research;safety abstracts;human factors;occupational safety;safety;safety research;accident prevention;drivers;violence prevention;highway traffic control;bicycle safety;tecnologias;grupo a;poisoning prevention;falls;driver information systems;ergonomics;suicide prevention	This work presents a collision avoidance control strategy that solves the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation for an agent to quickly take action assuming a worst-case scenario. By doing so, the agent can develop a control strategy that is robust to the strategies of other agents with whom collision is possible. Consequently, if the governing dynamics of the agent are sufficient, then a collision can be avoided. We build on the idea of finding control solutions by using a differential game theoretic approach (Mettenheim and Breitner, 2009). This is beneficial because the opposing agent’s strategy is incorporated into the control by assuming it plays the worst-case actions. The approach in this work solves the zero-sum aspects of the control on-line using a fast solution method that operates over partitions in the state space (Goode et al., ASME J Dyn Syst Meas Control, 2011). We form the solution to the Homicidal Chauffeur game which is used to provide the control for an evader attempting to avoid a pursuer, an agent that deviates from its normal path and into that of the evader. Furthermore, the evader is constrained to remain within defined boundaries of its assigned travel area, such as a road lane, water channel, etc. The control strategy consists of three parts: (1) a zero-sum approximation of collision avoidance, (2) high-level path planning, and (3) low-level vehicle control. Each component is explained, and an example is given using a real robotic vehicle control system. Here, we show how the control can be implemented using a simple processor located on a vehicle that seeks to avoid a collision with another oncoming vehicle, making a left turn.	theory	Brian J.

The size scaling of the desired formation is known only to a subset of the agents, and we present two decentralized strategies by which the agents can accomplish the formation task using only relative displacement feedback. A variable formation size allows the team of agents to adjust to changes in the environment or in group objectives, or respond to perceived threats, and control laws using only relative displacement information enables these strategies to be implemented using only local sensors and no interagent communication. We demonstrate the proposed strategies through several examples with simulations.	agent-based model;consensus dynamics;displacement mapping;image scaling;sensor;simulation	Samuel Coogan;Murat Arcak	2012	2012 American Control Conference (ACC)		control engineering;database index;simulation;computer science;engineering;sensor;control theory;feedback;mathematics	Robotics	58.11609936971933	-22.222209365133345	161536

Indeed, both are parts of a same problem that can be formulated in a general path planning framework. Based on this formulation, the algorithm proposed in this paper extends a popular sampling-based path planner, RRT, to solve general (dis)assembly planning problems involving objects with arbitrary shapes, and possibly requiring non-monotonic (dis)assembly sequences. The method does not require complex geometric computations, and is easy to implement. Experimental results show the efficiency of the method for solving a large class of problems.	algorithm;computation;motion planning;non-monotonic logic;sampling (signal processing)	Duc Thanh Le;Juan Cortés;Thierry Siméon	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/COASE.2009.5234177	mathematical optimization;computer science;operations management;engineering drawing	Robotics	54.109318406070706	-22.682053762491662	162191

To be effective and practical, the control architecture must be able to transition a group of robots from an initial swarm to a final formation. It must then be able to handle real-world events that could disrupt the formation, thus, requiring formation repair, obstacle avoidance, and changes in the formation. In previous work, we presented a distributed, reactive cellular automata-based formation control architecture capable of controlling any number of robots in formation at once. In this paper, we examine our architecture with respect to necessary characteristics to handle real-world occurrences. To address issues of formation repair and obstacle avoidance, the control architecture is extended by a distributed auctioning method that allows the robot formation to reconfigure autonomously.	automata theory;cellular automaton;consensus dynamics;mobile robot;obstacle avoidance;robot control;robustness (computer science);swarm	Ross Mead;Robert Louis Long;Jerry B.

The proposed navigation strategy is a finite-state machine that integrates three navigation aspects. This strategy falls in the category of hybrid architectures. The two aspects other than path planning discussed in this paper are path tracking and obstacle avoidance. Other aspects and behaviours can easily be added. For path tracking, a fuzzy control technique is suggested. The fuzzy controller is used to drive the robot through a set of waypoints leading to the destination. The curvature velocity method is proposed for obstacle avoidance. The testing was conducted on a P3-AT all-terrain mobile robot equipped with encoders, a gyroscope and sonar sensors for localisation and environment perception. The test results validate the theoretical analysis.	a* search algorithm;autonomous robot;computation;computational resource;dynamic programming;encoder;finite-state machine;fuzzy control system;gps navigation device;goal node (computer science);gyroscope;iterative method;mathematical optimization;mobile robot;motion planning;obstacle avoidance;real-time clock;real-time transcription;sonar (symantec);sensor;time complexity;velocity (software development)	Elie Maalouf;Maarouf Saad;Hamadou Saliah-Hassane;Faïçal Mnif	2006	IJMIC	10.1504/IJMIC.2006.008648	control engineering;mobile robot;computer vision;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;obstacle avoidance;finite-state machine;mobile robot navigation;fuzzy control system	Robotics	60.47527177652756	-21.278249737125176	163063

In spite of the wide range of techniques which are used for defining autonomous robot architectures, few attempts have been made in comparing their performance under similar circumstances. This comparison is particularly important in establishing benchmarks and in determining the best approach methods. The robotic tasks in our research concern mainly the convergence of behaviors like obstacle avoidance, hitting targets and shortest path finding using various methods of synthesizing control architectures' parameters. The first approach that has been used combines Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms in a simple yet robust controller using an Evolutionary Robotics technique. The second one introduces a manner of using Reinforcement Learning with a Neural Network based architecture. The experiments take place in a simulated 3D environment, which was designed to allow the development, testing and comparison of various controllers in terms of advantages and disadvantages in order to establish a benchmark for autonomous robots.	autonomous robot;benchmark (computing);control flow;evolutionary robotics;experiment;genetic algorithm;high-level programming language;neural networks;obstacle avoidance;pathfinding;reinforcement learning;shortest path problem	Sergiu Goschin;Eduard Franti;Monica Dascalu;Sandra Osiceanu	2007	2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	10.1109/CEC.2007.4424651	genetic algorithm;adaptive control;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;evolutionary robotics;reinforcement learning	Robotics	55.952351705057076	-18.33753001163295	163273

Shape representation requires a fair trade-off between minimum number of design parameters and design flexibility which likewise guarantees a good optimization convergence while allowing manifold design variations. Recently, shape morphing methods have gained increased attention because of their capability to represent complex shapes with a reasonable number of parameters, especially powerful if coupled with numerical simulations for measuring design performance. Free-form deformation, as prominent shape morphing representative, relies on an initial grid of control points, the control volume, which allows the modification of the embedded shape. The set-up of the control volume is a crucial process which in practice is done manually based on the experience of the human user. Here, a method for the automated construction of control volumes is suggested based on a proposed measure ECV which relies on the concept of evolvability as a potential capacity of representations to produce successful designs in a reasonable time. It is shown for target shape matching experiments that optimizations based on ECV-tuned control volumes provide a significantly better performance in design optimization.	algorithm;channel capacity;continuous design;control point (mathematics);data mining;embedded system;evolutionary computation;experiment;free-form deformation;heart rate variability;mathematical optimization;morphing;numerical analysis;optimal control;point of interest;simulation;single customer view	Stefan Menzel	2011	2011 IEEE Congress of Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2011.5949778	algorithm design;mathematical optimization;computer science;shape optimization;algorithm;evolutionary computation	Robotics	55.11344161803058	-19.4028460943711	164781

This article studies the use of task partitioning as a way to reduce interference in a spatially constrained harvesting task. Interference is one of the key problems in large cooperating groups. We present a simple method to allocate individuals of a robotic swarm to a partitioned task, and show that task partitioning can increase system performance by reducing sources of interference. The method is experimentally studied, both in an environment with a narrow area and an environment without this constraint. The results are analyzed and compared to the case in which task partitioning is not employed.	binary space partitioning;experiment;interference (communication);robot;shoes;swarm robotics;task allocation and partitioning of social insects	Giovanni Pini;Arne Brutschy;Mauro Birattari;Marco Dorigo	2009				Robotics	56.804036768845535	-23.727872031931955	171706

Their analysis plays an important role in problems such as safe motion planning and obstacle avoidance, yet computing solutions is often computationally expensive due to the need to consider adversarial inputs. In this work, we present an open-loop formulation of a two-player reach-avoid game whereby the players define their control inputs prior to the start of the game. We define two open-loop games, each of which is conservative towards one player, show how the solutions to these games are related to the optimal feedback strategy for the closed-loop game, and demonstrate a modified Fast Marching Method to efficiently compute those solutions.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;control system;emoticon;fast marching method;initial condition;iterative method;motion planning;obstacle avoidance	Zhengyuan Zhou;Ryo Takei;Haomiao Huang;Claire J.

The approach is based on consensus algorithms, which are basically characterized by information exchange among the team members. The proposal is based on predictive control, in order to compute decentralized control laws, considering constraints and different response requirements. Our work allows considering together vehicles without and with non-holonomic restrictions while optimizing the sensing range, particularly that of fixed frontal cameras, by managing orientation in the way to the rendezvous point. We show the effectiveness of our strategy with simulation results.

Although hull form optimization of marine vessels has long been an active area of research, limited attempts in the past have focused on the design optimization of UUVs and there are even fewer reports on the use of high-fidelity analysis methods within the course of optimization. While it is understood that the high-fidelity analysis is more accurate, they also tend to be far more computationally expensive. Thus, it is important to identify when a high-fidelity analysis is required as opposed to a low-fidelity estimate. The work reported in this paper is an extension of the authors previous work of a design optimization framework, where the design problem was solved using a low-fidelity model based on empirical estimates of drag. In this paper, the framework is extended to deal with high-fidelity estimates derived through seamless integration of computer-aided design, meshing and computational fluid dynamics analysis tools i.e., computer aided 3-D interactive application, ICEM, and FLUENT. The effects of using low-fidelity and high-fidelity analyses are studied in depth using a small-scale (length nominally less than 400 mm) and light-weight (less than 450 g) toy submarine. Useful insights on possible means to identify appropriateness of fidelity models via correlation measures are proposed. The term optimality used in this paper refers to optimal hull form shapes that satisfy placement of a set of prescribed internal components.	analysis of algorithms;computation;computational fluid dynamics;computer-aided design;constrained optimization;embedded system;evolutionary algorithm;kendall tau distance;mathematical optimization;multidisciplinary design optimization;norm (social);program optimization;requirement;seamless3d;simulation;time complexity;unmanned aerial vehicle;user requirements document;vortex	Khairul Alam;Tapabrata Ray;Sreenatha G.

The control strategy focuses on the improvement of vehicle fuel efficiency and system mobility. In presence of wireless communication among the involved CAVs and the intersection controllers, our coordination strategy focuses on leading the CAVs travel through a road network without conventional traffic light control and ensuring collision avoidance at the intersection areas. We propose a three-layered coordination strategy in this paper. First, we evaluate the road desired average velocity considering both upstream and downstream traffic to speed up the traffic density balance. Second, the intersection controllers optimally assign reference velocity to each vehicle based on the minimization of velocity deviation from its current velocity and collision avoidance at the intersections.

The proposed strategy deploys a control theoretic bottom-up approach where, continuous controllers are coordinated by a supervisory controlled discrete event system. All the mobile robots are required to navigate in an obstacle populated environment. And the followers keep a predetermined geometric formation with the leader while being adaptable to the constraints imposed by obstacles on the environment. The low level control is achieved by a set of behavior based controller with a high-level discrete event system that manages the dynamic interaction with the external environment. The use of discrete event systems reflects a modular manageable system with the potential for scalability and reusability. The proposed system is implemented through simulation and the results are shown to verify its operation.	algorithm;consensus dynamics;high- and low-level;mobile robot;odometry;population;pose (computer vision);robotic mapping;scalability;simulation;theory;usability;velocity (software development)	Gayan W.

We use this approach to formulate robot motion plans as sequences of primitives to be executed one after the other. When dealing with dynamical movement primitives, besides accomplishing the high-level objective, planners must also reason about the effect of the plan’s execution on the safety of the platform. This task becomes more daunting in the presence of disturbances, such as external forces. To alleviate this issue, we present a framework that builds on rigorous control-theoretic tools to generate safely-executable motion plans for externally excited robotic systems. Our framework is illustrated on a 3D limit-cycle gait bipedal robot that adapts its walking pattern to persistent external forcing.	adaptive switching;executable;high- and low-level;limit cycle;robot;theory	Sushant Veer;Ioannis Poulakakis	2018	CoRR		limit cycle;control engineering;engineering;gait	Robotics	60.09123063864675	-23.650872473374946	178274

Vision-based path planning and subsequent tracking are performed by utilizing proposed stable adaptive state feedback fuzzy tracking controllers designed using the Lyapunov theory and particle-swarm-optimization (PSO)-based hybrid approaches. The objective is to design two self-adaptive fuzzy controllers, for -direction and -direction movements, optimizing both its structures and free parameters, such that the designed controllers can guarantee desired stability and, simultaneously, can provide satisfactory tracking performance for the vision-based navigation of mobile robot. The design methodology for the controllers simultaneously utilizes the global search capability of PSO and Lyapunov-theory-based local search method, thus providing a high degree of automation. Two different variants of hybrid approaches have been employed in this work. The proposed schemes have been implemented in both simulation and experimentations with a real robot, and the results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed concept.	autonomous robot;fuzzy concept;local search (optimization);lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;mobile robot;motion planning;particle swarm optimization;robotic mapping;simulation	Kaushik Das Sharma;Amitava Chatterjee;Anjan Rakshit	2012	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2012.2182868	control engineering;mobile robot;computer vision;adaptive control;tracking system;computer science;engineering;control theory	Robotics	59.59535492963967	-20.553610837804875	178848

There are two major differences: movement in a CA is restricted to a grid and navigation is achieved by moving directly in the desired direction. Force based ODE models operate in continuous space and navigation is computed indirectly through the acceleration vector. We present the Optimal Steps Model and the Gradient Navigation Model, which produce trajectories similar to each other. Both are grid-free and free of oscillations, leading to the conclusion that the two major differences are also the two major weaknesses of the older models.	bridging (networking);cellular automaton	Felix Dietrich;Gerta Köster;Michael J.

The proposed cooperative control scheme includes three main modules: a wireless communication module, a direction decision module, and a motion control module. In the wireless communication module, an event-based communication rule is proposed, which means that mobile sensor nodes do not send their positions, velocities, and the data of environmental attributes to the other sensor nodes in real-time for the coordination and control of mobile sensor networks. Due to using the event-based communication rule, the communication bandwidth can be saved. In the direction decision module, a radial basis function network is used to model the monitored environment and is updated in terms of the sampled environmental data and the environmental data from the other sensor nodes by the wireless communication module. The updated environment model is used to guide the mobile sensor network to move towards the region of interest in order to efficiently model the distribution map of environmental attributes, such as temperature, salinity, and pH values for the monitored environment. In the motion control module, a finite-time consensus control approach is proposed to enable the sensor nodes to quickly change their movement directions in light of the gradient information from the environment model. As a result of using the event-based communication rule in the wireless communication module, the proposed control approach can also lower the updating times of the control signal. In particular, the proposed cooperative control scheme is still efficient under the directed wireless communication situation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative control scheme is illustrated for the problem of environmental monitoring.	consensus dynamics;control unit;gradient descent;radial basis function network;real-time locating system;region of interest;sampling - surgical action;sensor;thematic map	Yu Hu;Qiang Lu;Yanzhu Hu	2018		10.3390/s18082547	wireless sensor network;environmental monitoring;electronic engineering;engineering;control engineering	Mobile	57.22671728474828	-22.39282290189753	180728

Nowadays, complex construction tasks using mobile robots are characterized by two fundamental problems such as task planning and motion planning. However, to obtain the task and path planning that define a specific sequence of operations for construction of a given structure is generally very complex. In this context, we propose and investigate a system in which an aerial robot learns the assembly and construction tasks of multiple 3-D structures. This process involves the learning of the sequence of maneuvers of a vehicle, the assembly sequence of the parts and also the correct types of structural elements for each assembly point of the structure. A heuristic search algorithm is used in the learning process to find the optimal path for the quad-rotor so that its navigation through the dynamic environment is performed. The experimental results show that a 3-D structure can be built using the task planning approach derived from a learning algorithm combined with a heuristic search method.	aerobot;autonomous robot;heuristic;mobile robot;motion planning;r.o.t.o.r.;reinforcement learning;search algorithm	Sergio Ronaldo Barros dos Santos;Sidney N.

3b4ac842d6a6a73ec0b796ae168fd2dd3f10ef31	multi-vehicle planning using rrt-connect	endnotes;pubications	The problem of planning multiple vehicles deals with the design of an effective algorithm that can cause multiple autonomous vehicles on the road to communicate and generate a collaborative optimal travel plan. Our modelling of the problem considers vehicles to vary greatly in terms of both size and speed, which makes it suboptimal to have a faster vehicle follow a slower vehicle or for vehicles to drive with predefined speed lanes. It is essential to have a fast planning algorithm whilst still being probabilistically complete. The Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm developed and reported on here uses a problem specific coordination axis, a local optimization algorithm, priority based coordination, and a module for deciding travel speeds. Vehicles are assumed to remain in their current relative position laterally on the road unless otherwise instructed. Experimental results presented here show regular driving behaviours, namely vehicle following, overtaking, and complex obstacle avoidance. The ability to showcase complex behaviours in the absence of speed lanes is characteristic of the solution developed.	algorithm;apache axis;automated planning and scheduling;autonomous robot;failure;iteration;mathematical optimization;obstacle avoidance;run time (program lifecycle phase);scalability;while	Rahul Kala;Kevin Warwick	2011	Paladyn	10.2478/s13230-012-0004-5	simulation;computer science	Robotics	53.94944849426194	-23.136077730547765	183629

Based on the concept of modified path-velocity decomposition, a strategy, the interface propagation method, is proposed for path planning in this paper. Since all global navigation paths are assumed to be planned already without any static obstacle in their paths. Each sub-task along the global path of each controlled object contains a desired goal position and desired arrival time for reaching the position. Based on the information about each sub-task, the space/time graphs (STGs) for the objects are created. By shifting the speed path from corresponding forbidden regions on the STG, potential collisions can be avoided. An optimal speed path with least speed alteration for the controllable object is derived by the method of interface propagation. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated and the results show that a controllable and multiple uncontrollable objects can work together in a shared environment by avoiding collisions.	algorithm;apache axis;fast fourier transform;fast marching method;fastest;mathematical optimization;motion planning;scott continuity;simulation;smart objects;software propagation;star trek generations;time of arrival;velocity (software development)	Kao-Shing Hwang;Ming-Yi Ju	2002	Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems	10.1023/A:1014476524507	computer vision;simulation;space time;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	55.35777597929928	-22.735058593078975	184861

Connection graph of the assembly is constrained by the feasibility information made available from the analysis of local disassembly paths tried by the robot's path planner. Free space of the robot performing assembly is explicitly used to generate the disassembly constraints. We show with the help of a ball pen assembly how the sequencing is performed with this representation. Also, comparison with existing assembly sequencers like the AND/OR graph representation, directed graph representation and precedence relations representation is done to show that the use of free space analysis to constrain the assembly graphs leads to a more compact assembly graph and results into a better rejection of many of the infeasible sequences.

Each robotic vehicle in this scheme has its own coordinate system, and it senses its relative position and orientation to others, in order to make group formations. Although there exists no supervisor and each robotic vehicle has only relative position feedback from the others in the local area around itself, all the robotic vehicles are stabilized, which we have succeeded in proving mathematically only in the cases where the attractions between the robots are symmetrical. Each robotic vehicle especially has a two-dimensional control input referred to as a “formation vector” and the formation is controllable by the vectors. The validity of this scheme is supported by computer simulations. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Given a set of generating points and a suitable metric, the solution of the optimal coverage problem is the well known Voronoi tessellation, with a set of mobile agents converging to the centroids of the corresponding Voronoi cells. In the framework of decentralized motion control, this implementation requires that all agents have knowledge of the state of other agents in the platoon. Here we generalize this scenario by considering the optimal area coverage when a group of agents share information in a time varying, stochastically intermittent fashion. We embed on board of each agent a full state estimator that relies on local estimates and on information received by others, when available. We show that under appropriate conditions on the communication network, all agents' estimates asymptotically converge to true states while maximizing the coverage metric despite intermittent communications. The current work has applications in military and civilian domains including harbor protection, perimeter surveillance, and search and rescue missions. Theoretical results are illustrated through computer simulations.	algorithm;autonomous robot;computer simulation;converge;mobile agent;perimeter;sensor;telecommunications network;voronoi diagram;whole earth 'lectronic link	Md.

A methodology is proposed in which neural network based controllers are evolved in a simulation using a dynamic model qualitatively similar to the physical helicopter. Several network architectures and evolutionary sequences are investigated, and two approaches are found that can evolve very competitive controllers. The division of the neural network into modules and of the task into incremental steps seems to be a precondition for success, and we analyse why this might be so.	artificial neural network;flocking (behavior);mathematical model;precondition;simulation	Renzo De Nardi;Julian Togelius;Owen Holland;Simon M.

e006895ec973d05f633306140e6f21682fd0bf64	three-dimensional unmanned aerial vehicle path planning using modified wolf pack search algorithm		The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been a research focus in recent years. The path planner is a key element of the unmanned aerial vehicle autonomous control module. In this paper, the modified wolf pack search (WPS) algorithm is applied to compute the quasi-optimal trajectories for the rotor wing UAVs in the complex three-dimensional (3D) spaces including the real and fake 3D spaces. Moreover, it adopts the multi-objective cost function. In the path planning process, some concepts in the genetic algorithm (GA) are applied to realize the WPS algorithm. Then, the crossover and mutation operators in the GA method are introduced to improve the original WPS algorithm. Considering the dynamic properties of the vehicle, the path smoothing process based on the cubic B-spline curve is used to make the planning path suitable for the fixed wing UAVs. Simulation results show that this approach is efficient for the rotor wing UAVs and the fixed wing UAVs when taking into account of all kinds of constraints and the path generated is flyable. Moreover, the comparisons of the four algorithms show that the trajectories produced by the modified WPS algorithm are far superior to the original WPS algorithm, the GA and the random search way under the same conditions.	aerial photography;autonomous robot;b-spline;control unit;cubic function;genetic algorithm;loss function;motion planning;r.o.t.o.r.;random search;search algorithm;simulation;smoothing;software release life cycle;spline (mathematics);unmanned aerial vehicle	Yongbo Chen;Yuesong Mei;Jianqiao Yu;Xiaolong Su;Nuo Xu	2017	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2017.05.059	mathematical optimization;simulation	Robotics	59.490242133420786	-20.440710701107353	187911

The task is to compute a path for each agent from its initial location to its goal location without conflicting with other agents. MAPF solvers can be divided into classes based on their purpose. One of these classes is the class of online MAPF algorithms, in which the search for paths is interleaved with the actual physical moves of the agents. A prominent algorithm in this class is the Windowed Hierarchical Cooperative A* algorithm (WHCA*) where paths are planned for each agent individually and cooperation is obtained using a reservation table. A number of extensions for WHCA* already exist. In this paper we propose a general approach for the baseline WHCA* algorithm which is orthogonal to all other existing extensions. We improve WHCA* by introducing the Conflict Oriented (CO) principle for focusing the agent coordination around conflicts. In addition, we provide a conflict-oriented prioritization mechanism that intelligently chooses which agent should act next. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of our approach over WHCA*.	baseline (configuration management);co-np;develop;heuristic (computer science);ink serialized format;map;online algorithm;online and offline;pipeline (computing);window function	Zahy Bnaya;Ariel Felner	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907401	mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science	Robotics	55.24098828697088	-23.247761917994406	190658

A dynamic game played by N agents in 1-D motion is introduced and models, for instance, a foraging ant colony. Each agent controls its velocity to minimize its total work done in a finite time interval. The game is shown to have a unique Nash equilibrium under two different foraging location specifications, and both equilibria display many features of a foraging swarm behavior observed in biological swarms. Explicit expressions are derived for pairwise distances between individuals of the swarm, swarm size, and swarm center location during foraging.	ant colony;distance;information foraging;nash equilibrium;specification;swarm;velocity (software development)	A.

First we have developed a cost function that provides a set of via points determining a suitable path according to the obstacles present in the surroundings and other restrictions in its motion. Then we fit a suitable polynomial to this set of interior points to ensure that the journey is smooth and takes place with the consumption of minimum energy. The set of via-points as well as the minimum energy path have been determined using IWO (Invasive Weed Optimization) which is a new search heuristic based on the colonizing property of weeds. Application of such evolutionary algorithms in trajectory planning is advantageous because the exact solution to the path planning problem is not always available beforehand and must be determined dynamically. The entire procedure has been demonstrated through simulations. The above formulation is very simple and versatile and can be effectively applied to a variety of situations.	evolutionary algorithm;heuristic;loss function;mathematical optimization;motion planning;polynomial;robotic arm;simulation	Abhronil Sengupta;Tathagata Chakraborti;Amit Konar;Atulya K.

The original NMP problem is replaced by a series of progressively constrained ones that are solved successively, and whose solution path converges towards a solution of the original problem. The nonholonomic constraints are introduced progressively in an iterative algorithm. Each iteration consists of exploring a neighborhood of the path obtained from the previous iteration, searching for a path that satisfies more accurate constraints. The explorations proceed according to a dynamic programming procedure able to deal with optimization criteria.	motion planning	Pierre Ferbach	1996		10.1109/ROBOT.1996.509160	control engineering;mobile robot;mathematical optimization;nonholonomic system;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics;motion planning;iterative method	Robotics	61.011678349545406	-19.480105101158816	193589

Since optimization can be performed independently [2, 11], we aim at quick planning of any collision-free trajectory, but not on opt imal paths with respect to smoothness or length of the path. Usually in robotics tasks are not given in (work-space) positions but in configurations in the manipula tor ' s configuration-space. The calculation of a configuration that brings the manipula tor (or better its tool-center-point) on a certain position can be calculated using the inverse kinematics 1. Given work-space obstacles, the computa t ion of the configuration-space obstacles is exponential in the dimension of configuration-space and polynomial in both the degree of the polynomials describing the obstacles in work-space and the number of these polynomials [8]. Hence it is computat ional ly not feasible to compute in advance a complete model with reasonable accuracy. In dynamically changing environments this is even theoretically impossible. Therefore information for any planning must be produced by sensors during operation. The only available, reasonably priced sensor is a force-torque-sensor to be integrated into each joint of the manipulator . The force-torque-sensor indicates whether the manipulator hits an obstacle, i.e. whether the current configuration is collision free. Using only this information, calculated in the manipulator simulation, we present an approach that constructs a subgoal-graph in configuration-space C using random configurations. To plan a t rajectory for arbi trary start and goal configurations, only sub-trajectories from 1 In general there is no algebraic solution for the inverse kinematics of arbitrary manipulators, however, closed formulas exist for nowadays industrially used manipulators.	industrial robot;inverse kinematics;mathematical optimization;motion planning;polynomial;robotics;sensor;simulation;time complexity;tor messenger	Martin Eldracher;Thomas Pic	1997		10.1007/BFb0052116	configuration space;any-angle path planning;computer science;motion planning	Robotics	53.76202245658183	-23.453050395626587	195364
