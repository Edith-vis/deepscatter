1e15a5eff794f9dd8107c35391098982082e42c6	double optimization of fuel consumption and speed tracking		This paper presents automatic fuel consumption optimization with simultaneous keeping the recommended vehicle’s speed. These tasks are closely related since a simple minimization of fuel consumption leads to stopping a vehicle. The proposed “double” optimization is performed online using combination of two controllers. The first of them is based on fully probabilistic design (FPD) under Bayesian methodology. It optimizes the “driver-vehicle” closed loop with the aim to save fuel and keep the recommended speed, using externally given setpoints. Optimized values serve as setpoints for PID controller, which provides necessary setpoint tracking. Research is performed in collaboration with Škoda auto (www.skoda-auto.com).	closed-loop transfer function;flat panel detector;mathematical optimization;pid;setpoint (control system);simulation	Evgenia Suzdaleva;Ivan Nagy;Lenka Pavelkova;Tereza Mlynarova	2013		10.3182/20130703-3-FR-4038.00050	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	57.21193078309841	-11.824130697278902	163577
b8d6598616dcc797ce68ba4fdea73fe5529b448e	iiot based efficiency monitoring of a gantry robot		The Industrial Internet of Thing (IIoT) approach to an Industry plant design, devises a comprehensive interconnection of the system components, from sections up to single devices, in order to get a general and punctual understanding of the process. Such an intelligent network, mostly based on Ethernet basic layers, when properly conceived, should be able to add relevant value to the plant operation. This paper shows how, within the IIoT frame topics, the plant efficiency can be addressed and bring relevant improvement. The reason is that variables directly related to the energy consumption, such as current, electric power, actuator and motor torque, speed, etc., can be timely and easily monitored in the entire plant, since they are already conveyed on the network, due to real time control and diagnostics purpose. A power consumption diagram can be derived, and give hints on how to optimize operations, based on some efficiency index. It is quite easy to show how this approach converges with the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The paper, after a general discussion, proves it with a practical example based on a Gantry robot, driven in an EtherCAT based automation network.	cartesian coordinate robot;diagram;industry 4.0;intelligent network;interconnection;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;performance tuning;physical plant;programming paradigm;real-time clock;relevance;smt placement equipment;torque	Stefano Farne;Ezio Bassi;Francesco Benzi;Francesco Compagnoni	2016	2016 IEEE 14th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)	10.1109/INDIN.2016.7819252	control engineering;simulation;engineering;operations management	Robotics	54.30633106986879	-10.37950761647634	165264

Typically, these guidance laws have the disadvantage of not being able to fully take into account system and/or vehicle limitations such as maximum thrust. In this paper, optimal control and numerical optimization methods are used to provide a guidance scheme that may incorporate these critical constraints, while still ensuring a successful hit-to-kill interception of the target. Therein, a direct optimal control approach is deployed, based on multiple shooting and a sequential quadratic programming algorithm for solving the resulting nonlinear optimization problem. Numerical results for three distinctive transcription methods for deriving the nonlinear program are presented that illustrate the overall efficiency of numerical optimization as a guidance scheme.	algorithm;computer simulation;heuristic (computer science);loop optimization;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;open-shop scheduling;optimal control;optimization problem;perturbation theory;real-time clock;real-time computing;scheduling (computing);sequential quadratic programming;thrust;transcription (software)	Leif Walter;Gunther Schloffel;Spilios Theodoulis;Philippe Wernert;Ekaterina A.

a15e91e044e9d6604ef6fb7d3c6d1d63f11ac9a9	comprehensive evaluation method for performance of unmanned robot applied to automotive test using fuzzy logic and evidence theory and fnn		In order to obtain reliable and exact evaluation, a new comprehensive evaluation method for performance of an unmanned robot applied to automotive test (URAT) using fuzzy logic, evidence theory and fuzzy neural network (FNN) is presented in this paper. Throttle repeatability, speed tracking accuracy, speed repeatability, driving shock degree are used as the system evaluation index. The subjective evaluation results with various expressions are quantified using fuzzy logic. The group decision making with quantified subjective evaluation results from various drivers is combined through evidence theory. The objective evaluation indexes measured by instrumentation and the corresponding combined subjective evaluation are self-learned and trained with FNN. The comprehensive performance evaluation system of the URAT is established. Finally, real vehicle experiments are conducted. The effectiveness of the presented method for the URAT is experimentally verified. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The subjects are divided into 5 groups of 11 subjects. Each group interacts with a different system. We use the experimental results to determine characteristics (e.g., system zeros, relative degree, phase lag) that can make systems difficult for a human to control. We use subsystem identification to model the control strategies (feedback and feedforward) that each subject uses during their first and last trials. For each group, the average identified feedforward controller on the last trial approximates the inverse dynamics of the system with which the subjects in that group interacted.	dynamical system;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;inverse dynamics	S.

04b8f320a488fd71b3e8b6d1656fec83b7439fa1	fuzzy and 2-dof controllers for processes with a discontinuously variable parameter		The application with a discontinuously variable parameter (moment of inertia) discussed in this paper is represented by an experimental setup, namely the Model 220 Industrial Plant Emulator (M220IPE), which allows the testing of several control solutions by performing real-time experiments. This paper suggests a simple state feedback control structure with three position controllers developed with the aid of linearized mathematical models and particular features of the process. The control structures contain conventional controllers (PID) and also advanced control solutions (Takagi-Sugeno PD+I fuzzy and two-degree-offreedom PID controllers). The aim of these control structures is to achieve good robustness, good disturbance control behaviours regarding the model uncertainties and also to improve set-point responses. The proposed control structures are validated by digital and experimental results obtained for three specific values of the moment of inertia.	advanced process control;control flow;emulator;experiment;feedback;mathematical model;pid;real-time clock	Alexandra-Iulia Szedlak-Stînean;Radu-Emil Precup;Emil M.

The extended Kalman filter (EKF) with input estimation (IE) was developed for an RV tracking in a clear environment. However, radar tracking suffers from clutters in the form of unwanted, unavoidable and unpredictable signal echoes from sea, land and weather. The Hough transform is a well-known technique for identifying a straight line in noisy environments. This technique can be utilised to design a clutter elimination algorithm for clutters censoring. This study presents a novel tracking algorithm by integrating the EKF, IE and clutter elimination algorithm to track the RVs in cluttered environments. To ensure an RV to be tracked continuously, the estimation errors between the predicted and the real trajectories should be within a range cell. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm can provide an acceptable accuracy to maintain the track. Although clutters cannot be totally censored, the effects of resting clutters can be reduced to an acceptable range. The proposed algorithm may thus help radars in achieving continuous tracking. In conclusion, this algorithm deserves further study and application.	vehicle tracking system	Chengyu Liu;Chung-Hsing Chyuan	2010	Int. J.

There are two main design perspectives to be considered. First of all, the mobile system should guarantee traversability on rough terrains in microgravity condition. Secondly, the system should be sustainable in the extreme environment of the lunar surface including cosmic rays and excessive temperature changes. For the issues, we analyzed four elements for design of a wheeled mobile robot; wheel configuration, suspension, steering, and actuator placement.

However, during steady state, torque, flux and current ripple occur. An improvement of the electric drive can be obtained using a DTC scheme based on the space vector modulation (SVM) which reduces the torque and flux ripple. The proposed control scheme considers the rotor resistance variation.This paper also discusses the application of artificial neural network (ANN) as a speed estimator.The capability and precision of this scheme as a speed estimator is verified by simulation results, from which it is concluded that the proposed control scheme produces better results than the classical DTC.	artificial neural network	Pedro Ponce;Flavio Lucio Pontecorvo;José Ramón Álvarez Bada;Alfonso Monroy;Marco Antonio Paz-Ramos	2006			control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Vision	60.084345554366365	-10.229667729029723	173688

A trade-off between performance and complexity is the main factor in the design of this kind of system. The use of fuzzy logic is specially indicated when trying to emulate such human control actions as driving a car. This paper presents a fuzzy system that cooperatively controls the throttle and brake pedals for automatic speed control up to 50 km/h. It is thus appropriate for populated areas where driving involves constant speed changes, but within a range of low speeds because of traffic jams, road signs, traffic lights, etc. The system gets the current and desired speeds for the car and generates outputs to control the two pedals. It has been implemented in a real car, and tested in real road conditions, showing good speed control with smooth actions resulting in accelerations that are comfortable for the car’s occupants.	approximation error;artificial intelligence;can bus;complexity;controller (computing);fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;game controller;leased line;linear model;population	Enrique Onieva;Vicente Milanés;Carlos González;Teresa de Pedro;Joshué Pérez;Javier Alonso	2010	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574709005815	control engineering;intelligent transportation system;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;automotive engineering;transport engineering;fuzzy control system	Robotics	60.02715297363432	-14.92762854286239	174726

The mechanical modeling of the structure and the subsequent finite element approximation are based on the classical equations of motion, as they are derived from Hamilton’s principle, in connection with simplified modeling of the piezoelectric sensors and actuators. One natureinspired intelligence method, the Particle Swarm Optimization, is used for the vibration control of the beam. Three different variants of the Particle Swarm Optimization were tested, namely, the simple Particle Swarm Optimization, the inertia Particle Swarm Optimization and the Constriction Particle Swarm Optimization. A linear feedback control law and a quadratic cost function are used, so that the results are comparable with the classical linear quadratic regulator approach. The same problem has been solved with two other stochastic based optimization algorithms, namely a Genetic Algorithm and a Differential Evolution and the results are used for comparison. The numerical simulation shows that sufficient vibration suppression can be achieved by means of this method. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The indirect field oriented control strategy (IFOC) is used as a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive platform. Neural network controller and estimator are respectively added to replace the conventional speed regulator and the speed encoder in the global drive scheme. A wide speed working range is considered and high speed mode is incorporated in the study testes. In the IFOC inner control loops, the commonly used synchronous frame conventional proportional plus integral (PI) controllers are replaced by two modified internal model control (IMC) regulators. Therefore, a method based on the bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) algorithm is performed to optimize and adjust the IMC low pass filter parameters. The robustness of the proposed PMSM sensorless drive scheme is confirmed by simulation tests in the MATLAB/SIMULINK. Moreover, a comparative evaluation results are illustrated to prove the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm according to different controllers combinations.	algorithm;artificial neural network;basic formal ontology;control theory;encoder;low-pass filter;matlab;mathematical optimization;memory controller;network interface controller;performance;recurrent neural network;simulation;simulink	Aymen Flah;Lassaâd Sbita	2012	Applied Intelligence	10.1007/s10489-012-0361-0	simulation;computer science;machine learning;artificial neural network	Robotics	60.8152514650782	-9.934703871031491	179490

Multi-attribute utility analysis is a tool used by systems engineers to aid in deciding amongst numerous alternatives. Its strength lies in the fact that very different metrics can be compared, and that it takes unto account human preferences and risk attitudes. As a design tool, multi-attribute utility analysis is performed off line, during the system design phase, to choose among possible designs, components, gains, etc. We offer a demonstration of multi-attribute utility analysis in designing a hybrid switched-system visual servo system. We have previously introduced such a system, and here use multi-attribute utility analysis to select a switching algorithm that best suits the needs of a specific user.	algorithm;biasing;control system;design tool;failure rate;hybrid system;robot;servo;systems design;systems engineering;visual servoing	Nicholas R.

In a wheeled vehicle engine system comprising a compressed air powered engine and tank assemblies, an engine connects to the vehicle drive wheels and is powered by compressed air and operates without emitting air pollutants and the tank assembly comprises a replaceable and/or rechargeable main air tank assembly containing air at high pressure and recovery tanks both so connected to the engine and arranged such that to recover and store energy of the vehicle and engine developed during braking and high speed engine operation which was not fully utilize to propel the vehicle.

This paper presents a novel method to detect intoxicated driving and lays a foundation that can be implemented in future cars to derive personalized models of drivers and to detect not only intoxicated driving but also other reckless driving styles. We employ system identification techniques to develop models for sober and impaired drivers. A total of 200 sets of data from various subject drivers were collected in a high-fidelity driving simulator. The lateral preview error and the steering wheel angle were considered the input and output of a driver, respectively. We will demonstrate that the autoregressive noise integration moving average with exogenous input (ARIMAX) model best fits the data to describe the steering behavior of drivers. The positions of model poles are shown to be a good indicator of intoxicated driving behavior. An aggressive driving style due to impaired driving leads to the migration of dominant poles toward the instability region. The Kalman filter and online identification techniques are used to update the driver model during driving. The poles of this updated model are used for the detection of impaired driving.	autoregressive model;device driver;driving simulator;fits;input/output;instability;kalman filter;lateral thinking;menace;personalization;simulation;steering wheel;system identification	Mehran M.

Its objective is to minimize the fuel consumption (FC) of HEVs using only the information on the current state of charge (SoC) of the battery and data available from a standard onboard navigation system. This objective is achieved using a predictive reference signal generator (pRSG) in combination with a nonpredictive reference tracking controller for the battery SoC. The pRSG computes the desired battery SoC trajectory as a function of vehicle position such that the recuperated energy is maximized despite the constraints on the battery SoC. To compute the SoC reference trajectory, only the topographic profile of the future road segments and the corresponding average traveling speeds must be known. Simulation results of the proposed predictive strategy show substantial improvements in fuel economy in hilly driving profiles, compared with nonpredictive strategies. A parallel HEV is analyzed in this paper. However, the proposed method is independent of the powertrain topology. Therefore, the method is applicable to all types of HEVs.	network topology;simulation;state of charge;topography	Daniel Ambühl;Lino Guzzella	2009	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2009.2027709	control engineering;topographic map;convex optimization;simulation;computer science;engineering;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	56.56470313791506	-11.845679714567503	185802

As image acquisition devices become cheaper and faster, vibration measurement and frequency estimation through image sequence analysis continue to receive increasing attention. In the conventional photogrammetry and optical methods of frequency measurement, vibration signals are first extracted before implementing the vibration frequency analysis algorithm. In this work, we demonstrate that frequency prediction can be achieved using a single feed-forward convolutional neural network. The proposed method is verified using a vibration signal generator and excitation system, and the result compared with that of an industrial contact vibrometer in a real application.

The very nature of these environments, however, increases the likelihood of robot failures. Common failure tolerance techniques rely on eeective failure detection. Since a failure may not always be successfully detected, or even if detected, may not be detected soon enough, it becomes important to consider the behavior of manipulators with undetected failures. This work focuses on developing techniques to analyze a manipulator's workspace and identify regions in which tasks, characterized by sequences of point-to-point moves, can be completed even with such failures.

Quantum genetic algorithm is employed to tune type-2 fuzzy sets and rule sets simultaneously for effective design of interval type-2 FLCs. Traditional fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs), often termed as type-1 FLCs using type-1 fuzzy sets, have difficulty in modeling and minimizing the effect of uncertainties present in many real time applications. Therefore, manually designed type-2 FLCs have been utilized in many control process due to their ability to model uncertainty and it relies on heuristic knowledge of experienced operators. The type-2 FLC can be considered as a collection of different embedded type-1 FLCs. However, manually designing the rule set and interval type-2 fuzzy set for an interval type-2 FLC to give a good response is a difficult task. The purpose of our study is to make the design process automatic. The type-2 FLCs exhibit better performance for compensating the large amount of uncertainties with severe nonlinearities. Furthermore, the adaptive type-2 FLC is validated through a set of numerical experiments and compared with QGA evolved type-1 FLCs, traditional and neural type-1 FLCs.	adaptive architecture;embedded system;experiment;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;genetic algorithm;heuristic;intelligent control;mobile robot;motion planning;numerical analysis;quantum;robot control;robotic arm;type-1 owa operators;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems;workspace	Pintu Chandra Shill;Md.

To further improve the efficiency of these devices, new intelligent control solutions are required. These solutions necessitate the behaviour modeling of the refrigerators. We seek models with as simple structure as possible, since future intelligent controllers may use such models in real time, thus their evaluation must be feasible even on simple microcontrollers. We investigate various dynamic models to describe the behavior of the refrigerator, i.e. the cool-down and warm-up phases.

Two intelligent controllers based on fuzzy logic and neural network are developed to trace the desired trajectory for a robot. A variety of evolutionary algorithms, have been proposed to approximately solve problems of common engineering applications. Increasingly common applications involve automatic learning of nonlinear mappings that govern the behavior of control systems. In many cases where robot control is of primary concern, the systems used to demonstrate the effectiveness of evolutionary algorithms often do not represent practical robotic systems. In this paper, genetic algorithms (GA) are the evolutionary strategy of interest. This procedure and the manner in which fuzzy controllers are codified into chromosomes is described. It is applied to learn fuzzy control rules for a practical autonomous vehicle steering control problem, namely, path tracking. GA handles the simultaneous evolution of membership functions and rule bases for the fuzzy path tracker. Simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy controller whose all parameters have been tuned simultaneously using GAs, offers advantages over existing controllers and has improved performance.	artificial neural network;autonomous robot;evolutionary algorithm;fuzzy concept;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithm;image noise;initial condition;intelligent agent;mobile robot;nonlinear system;refinement (computing);responsiveness;robot control;rule-based system;simulation;soft computing;software release life cycle;user interface	Mahdi Yousefi Azar Khanian;Ahmad Fakharian;Mehran Godarzvand Chegini;Bahram Jozi	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation - (CIRA)	10.1109/CIRA.2009.5423157	fuzzy electronics;genetic algorithm;defuzzification;computer science;control system;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;neuro-fuzzy;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;control theory;evolutionary robotics;fuzzy set operations;artificial neural network;intelligent control	Robotics	59.756028120542574	-11.712983266611188	192337
8ce2801c4ab4e25459daf6d1bc5c3c729b0ceb20	dynamic-model-based switched proportional-integral state observer design and traffic density estimation for urban freeway		Abstract In the face of the frequent occurrence of urban traffic congestion, only part traffic sensors can be utilized in the urban freeway, in order to more accurately estimate traffic densities and timely identify the congested road segments, a novel estimated algorithm of proportional integral state observer is proposed. Firstly, by embedding the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) into the Dynamic Graph Hybrid Automata (DGHA) framework, we model traffic flow over the urban freeway network. In modeling procedure, an urban freeway network is partitioned in term of three hierarchical structures which are freeway networks, links and cells, respectively. On the one hand, both the dual digraph of road segment structure and hybrid automata respectively are adopted to describe the freeway topology and the multi-modes of dynamic densities in road segments. On the other hand, a deterministic and reasonable constraint is used to reduce the number of combination modes, and thus the modeling procedure is modularized, rule-based and easily-extensible with the help of a combination algorithm. Therefore, the Piecewise Affine System (PWAS) model of the freeway network can be obtained. Secondly, In order to estimate the traffic densities of the urban freeway network, based on the dynamic model, we design a switched proportional integral state observer, and the observer design problem is transferred into the stability problem of the switching system. So the proportional gains and integral gains can be computed via introducing the Lyapunov function and using LMI technique, and thus the traffic densities can be estimated by the designed observer. Especially, the traffic congestion can be identified by checking whether the estimated densities are greater than the critical ones. Finally, a section of Beijing south third ring freeway as an example to verify the proposed approach, and the effectiveness and the feasibility are shown in the experiment results.

The train regulator aims to maximize the schedule/headway adherence while minimizing the energy consumption. This paper presents a traffic-energy model to characterize the complicated dynamics with regard to the traffic and the energy consumption of a metro line, and devises an adaptive-optimal-control (AOC) algorithm to optimize the train regulator through reinforcement learning. The updating rules for reinforcement learning are deduced from the discrete minimum principle. Testing with field traffic data, the AOC algorithm succeeds in the optimization of the train regulator; no matter the system is disturbed by passenger-flow fluctuations or by frequently minor delays. The results also show that better train regulation with less energy consumption is attainable through the running-time and dwell-time controls.	age of empires ii: the conquerors;algorithm;automatic target recognition;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimal control;pontryagin's maximum principle;reinforcement learning;test set	Wei-Song Lin;Jih-Wen Sheu	2011	IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/TASE.2011.2160537	control engineering;heuristic;adaptive optimization;algorithm design;mathematical optimization;simulation;optimal control;adaptive control;schedule;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;dwell time;reinforcement learning;service quality	Robotics	55.94602202877943	-11.867708591328629	193076

In this paper, we present a new formulation of this problem for the case where the dynamic system is differentially flat. We show that a solution is easy to obtain in this case, in fact reducing to finite-dimensional linear least-squares minimization. We also show how to make this solution robust to model perturbation, sampled data, and measurement noise, as well as provide a recursive implementation for online learning. Finally, we apply our new formulation of inverse optimal control to model human locomotion during stair ascent. Given sparse observations of human walkers, our model predicts joint angle trajectories for novel stair heights that compare well to motion capture data (R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 1.95 degrees). These exemplar trajectories are the basis for an automated method of tuning controller parameters for lower-limb prosthetic devices that extends to locomotion modes other than level ground walking.	dynamical system;linear least squares (mathematics);loss function;motion capture;optimal control;recursion;robot;scalability;sparse matrix;times ascent;vii	Navid Aghasadeghi;Timothy Bretl	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907746	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	60.04685155660493	-16.58968944221676	193083

9e3eeb6053aa62ce2d76bd694796eb7a2021ffda	aircraft cabin thermal control strategy based on adaptive temperature and thermal sensation		An Environment Control System (ECS) in civil aircraft will control the cabin thermal environment with constant temperature control strategy. However, the passenger dress, heat loads will change with the flight process. This constant control strategy cannot satisfy these dynamic requirements and faces the challenge. An aircraft cabin thermal control strategy based on adaptive temperature and thermal sensation evaluation is presented in this paper to solve this question. The new thermal control strategy includes initial and accurate control strategies, which individually control the thermal environment. For the night flight mode, the initial control strategy with a constant supply air temperature is used to control the cabin thermal environment according to the adaptive temperature. For the day time, the accurate control strategy with a dynamic supply air temperature is used to control the cabin thermal environment according to the thermal sensation of passenger. This new control strategy can ensure passengers in the aircraft cabin to have a comfortable thermal sensation under different flight times and seasons.	control theory	Dong Liu;Liping Pang;Yunpeng Chen;Yue Zhou	2017		10.1109/ICCIS.2017.8274771	temperature control;engineering;control theory;flight (process);atmospheric model;thermal;solid modeling;control system	HCI	55.80710415851641	-12.07226890711308	196124

The advantage of PSO-MFFLC is quite simple structure and easy to be regulated. To validate the proposed controller, the nonlinear active suspension systems with non-linearity such as the parameters variation, external disturbance, and friction force effect are simultaneously taking into account to provide a realistic framework. The control objective is to deal with the classical conflict between minimizing vertical chassis acceleration to increase the ride comfort and keeping the dynamic wheel load small in order to ensure the ride safety. Moreover, modeling performed using a virtual detailed simulation environment LMS-AMESim, while the control part configured on Matlab/Simulink. Finally, the comparison of PSO-MFFLC with a classical PID, intelligent PID and the time-delay estimation control (TDEC) is conducted for different roads disturbances.		Ghazally I. Y. Mustafa;H. P.

In the very first ones, they can check the correct working of the control system and can detect any changes in the system to be controlled. In the case of the learning systems, CKBE allows to evaluate the behaviour of the generate individuals, in a previous step (limbo [2][4]), before use them in a real system.	artificial intelligence;evaluation function;fuzzy control system;genetic algorithm;knowledge base;knowledge-based systems;limbo	Joaquín Cañada Bago;Luis Magdalena	1999			actuator;concentric;solenoid;magnetic circuit;acoustics;excitation;physics	AI	58.807184153084116	-11.426550258893826	199861
