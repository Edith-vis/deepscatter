In this paper, Elman neural network is applied to the model of the clarifying process of sugar cane juice. An improved method of dual heuristic programming (DHP) affiliated to the approximate dynamic programming (ADP) family is employed to the optional control of neutralized pH value and purified juice pH value in clarifying process of sugar cane juice. The main advantage of this method is to add an “approximate” neural network, which takes use of the states and actions during delay-time of the system to calculate partial derivative of state with respect to action, consequently it overcomes the difficulty of using the system model to calculate the partial derivative of state with respect to action because of the large lagging time. As a result the DHP algorithm is more suitable for real-time process control and on-line application. Finally, the results of the simulation indicate that the improved DHP method has good control effect.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;dynamic programming;heuristic;nonlinear system;online and offline;optimal control;real-time clock;simulation;usb on-the-go	Xiaofeng Lin;Jiaran Yang;Huixia Liu;Shaojian Song;Chunning Song	2009	2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks	10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178787	systems modeling;optimal control;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;dynamic programming;mathematical model;control theory;artificial neural network	Robotics	58.44619540096709	-7.004303032910152	156599

On the basis of a previously developed integrated control, which switches two controllers, two new variables are considered (COJ/X/sub 2/ and /spl Delta/QCH/sub 4/); next, the two controllers are transformed to fuzzy proportional-integral (PI) variables; and finally, Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy supervisor is developed in order to smooth the switching. Hence, a hierarchical fuzzy control structure is built: the low level is constituted by the fuzzy PI and the higher one by the fuzzy supervisor. This new strategy allows an increase in methane production. Applicability of the proposed structure is illustrated via simulations.	fuzzy control system	Edgar N.

The learning algorithm takes fuzzy -completeness as a standard to adjust parameters, and the algorithm can make a comment on the fuzzy rules and the importance of input variables, ensuring that input variable width of every rule will be auto-adapted adjustment according to its contribution to the system, thus synchronous identification for the load model structure and parameters could be achieved. The simulation from a substation measurement data indicates that the generalized dynamic fuzzy neural network load model has a good fitting degree and strong generalization capability.	algorithm;artificial neural network;fuzzy rule;heart rate variability;neuro-fuzzy;randomness;rate of convergence;rule-based system;simulation;traction substation	Xiaofang Li;Minfang Peng;Hao He;Tao Liu	2012	2012 Third International Conference on Digital Manufacturing & Automation	10.1109/ICDMA.2012.82	control engineering;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Robotics	58.835281695031284	-9.599754188319569	158105
f6cc7c783bb75578dd2c3d7cf251cc1ba13a1733	heart rate control during treadmill exercise using input-sensitivity shaping for disturbance rejection of very-low-frequency heart rate variability	physiological control;frequency response;heart rate;feedback control;treadmill exercise	Background: Automatic and accurate control of heart rate (HR) during treadmill exercise is important for prescription and implementation of training protocols. The principal design issue for feedback control of HR is to achieve disturbance rejection of very-low-frequency heart rate variability (VLF-HRV) with a level of control signal activity (treadmill speed) which is sufficiently smooth and acceptable to the runner. This work aimed to develop a new method for feedback control of heart rate during treadmill exercise based on shaping of the input sensitivity function, and to empirically evaluate quantitative performance outcomes in an experimental study. Methods: Thirty healthy male subjects participated. 20 subjects were included in a preceding study to determine an approximate, average nominal model of heart rate dynamics, and 10 were not. The design method guarantees that the input sensitivity function gain monotonically decreases with frequency, is therefore devoid of peaking, and has a pre-specified value at a chosen critical frequency, thus avoiding unwanted amplification of HRV disturbances in the very-low-frequency band. Controllers were designed using the existing approximate nominal plant model which was not specific to any of the subjects tested. Results: Accurate, stable and robust overall performance was observed for all 30 subjects, with a mean RMS tracking error of 2.96 beats/min and a smooth, low-power control signal. There were no significant differences in tracking accuracy or control signal power between the 10 subjects who were not in the preceding identification study and a matched subgroup of subjects who were (respectively: mean RMSE 2.69 vs. 3.28 beats/min, p = 0.24; mean control signal power 15.62 vs. 16.31 × 10−4 m2/s2, p = 0.37). Substantial and significant reductions over time in RMS tracking error and average control signal power were observed. Conclusions: The input-sensitivity-shaping method provides a direct way to address the principal design challenge for HR control, namely disturbance rejection in relation to VLF-HRV, and delivered robust and accurate tracking with a smooth, low-power control signal. Issues of parametric and structural plant uncertainty are secondary because a simple approximate plant model, not specific to any of the subjects tested, was sufficient to achieve accurate, stable and robust heart rate control performance.

The operation of our method is demonstrated on the task of identification of the well-known two-output continuous-stirred tank reactor process. The multiple-output ensemble model has smaller complexity and comparable performance, as compared to a collection of two single-output ensemble models.	dynamical system;ensemble forecasting;estimation theory;interaction;linear model;multicanonical ensemble;nonlinear system;reactor (software);whole earth 'lectronic link	Darko Aleksovski;Juš Kocijan;Saso Dzeroski	2014	2014 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2014.6862543	mathematical optimization;machine learning;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	54.64052321792555	-3.6409327939809413	158212
ccf05c1132f62b09735ce0b8775140728743fb65	control of aged automotive selective catalytic reduction systems for consistent performances		Abstract This paper develops a consistent emission control method for automotive selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems against variant aging conditions. SCR systems have been widely adopted on Diesel vehicles to reduce tailpipe NO x emissions thanks to their superior performance compared with other aftertreatment technology. While fresh SCRs have a high NO x removal efficiency, their NO x reduction performances will be significantly impaired as they get aged. To maintain the consistent emission performance of a SCR system over its entire duty life, it is necessary to design a robust and adaptive control method of SCR against the aging effects and ensure the consistent NO x reduction capability especially when SCR runs towards its end of life cycle. A control strategy that includes an ammonia coverage ratio tracking controller and a reference generator is derived and validated in simulation environment to account for various SCR aging conditions. The simulation results of US06 test cycle show that the proposed control strategy is able to maintain a consistent emission reduction performance under different aging conditions without generating excessive ammonia slip.	performance;rewriting	Yao Ma;Junmin Wang	2017	J.

A methodology for synthesizing an integrated feedforward–feedback control (FF/FBC) strategy is proposed for wide-range robust control of commercial-scale steam-electric power plants. In the proposed methodology, the feedforward control (FFC) policy is generated via nonlinear programming for simultaneous optimization of all control inputs under specified constraints. This family of optimized trajectories, which represent the best achievable performance of the plant under specified conditions, serve as tracking signals for the FF/FBC system. The feedback control (FBC) law is synthesized following the H1-based structured singular value( ) approach to achieve the specified stability and performance robustness. The major features of the integrated FF/FBC system are 1) optimized performance over a wide operating range resulting from the feedforward element and 2) guaranteed stability and performance robustness resulting from the feedback element. To exemplify this control methodology, a family of FFC policies has been synthesized based on a nonlinear state-space model of a 525 MWe fossil-fueled power plant. The synthesis of an FFC policy is identified as an optimization problem where the performance is characterized by rapid maneuvering of electric power to meet the specified load demand while simultaneously maintaining the throttle steam temperature and pressure, and the hot reheat steam temperature within allowable ranges of variation. The results of simulation experiments show that the FF/FBC system satisfies the specified performance requirements of power ramp up and down in the range of 40%–100% load under nominal operating conditions. The results also suggest that this robust control law is capable of rejecting the anticipated disturbances such that the plant closely follows the optimal trajectory determined by the FFC policy. Although this research focuses on control and operation of fossil power plants, the proposed FF/FBC synthesis methodology is also applicable to other complex processes such as planned shutdown of nuclear power plants, take-off and landing of aircraft, and start-up and transient operations of rocket engines.	control system;exemplification;experiment;fossil;feed forward (control);feedback;feedforward neural network;freebasic;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimal control;optimization problem;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;requirement;robust control;robustness (computer science);shutdown (computing);state space	Chen-Kuo Weng;Asok Ray	1996	IEEE Trans.

Dual fuel engines operate in two modes, a diesel mode or gas mode, and can burn either diesel fuel or natural gas fuel. To improve health parameter identifiability, we exploit transient data from mode transitions between the diesel mode and gas mode.

We find the following. (1) If training errors are the main concerns, Spline can perform better than the generalized dynamic fuzzy neural network (GD-FNN). (2) If the model is nonlinear with a disturbance term, the testing error of the GD-FNN is very large. If the model is chaotic with a disturbance term, both the training error and testing error of the GD-FNN are very large. (3) Using a sequential algorithm as in the GD-FNN, we would always be trapped at the local minima rather than the global minimum. In addition, we propose to use the characteristics among moments and fuzzy rules to identify the density function in advance.	converge;dynamic data;estimation theory;fuzzy rule;genetic algorithm;local optimum;matlab;maxima and minima;nl (complexity);neural networks;neuro-fuzzy;nonlinear system;numerical aperture;piecewise linear continuation;sequential algorithm;spline (mathematics)	Eva Chung-chiung Yen	2011	International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems	10.1142/S0218488511007465	spline;defuzzification;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;fuzzy transportation;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems;fuzzy classification;computer science;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;neuro-fuzzy;machine learning;data mining;mathematics;fuzzy associative matrix;fuzzy set operations;statistics	ML	53.99651675085135	-5.203659342573946	168105

Firstly, the dynamic model of induction motor is built by state space theory. Secondly, the corresponding inverse model is got by inverse system theory. However, the analytic inverse model is hardly used in the engineering field by excessively depending on the parameters. Finally, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based inverse model, which synthesises artificial intelligent method and analytic method, is suggested. To accelerate the convergence of ANN and enhance its generalisation ability, the non-linear parts are realised by the analytic expressions and the corresponding results act as the inputs of ANN so that the complex-non-linear mapping relation become a simple-linear mapping and the structure of ANN is simplified. A three-layered feed-forward ANN with 12-102 structure is introduced to approach the inverse mode of induction motor drives. Finally, the robustness of ANN-based inverse model is verified by simulation in the case of parameter variance and state disturbance.	artificial neural network;backpropagation;mathematical induction;mathematical model;nonlinear system;simulation;software propagation;state space;systems theory	Shuo Ding;Qinghui Wu	2011	IJAAC	10.1504/IJAAC.2011.043617	control engineering;analytic element method;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning;artificial neural network	ML	60.36123354846232	-5.891854324858664	168510
d4e0e9792237d7cd7245a331d671248f2677176a	two types of external linear models used for adaptive control of continuous stirred tank reactor		The main goal of this contribution is to show simulation results for two types of External Linear Models (ELM) used in the adaptive control as a linear representation of the originally nonlinear system. The nonlinearity is dispathed with the use of recursive identification which recomputes parameters of ELM in each step according to actual state of the system. The controller design employes polynomial approach with pole-placement method and spectral factorization and all these techniques together satisfies basic control requirements. The verification was done on the mathematical model of Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) as a typical member of the nonlinear equipment widely used in chemical industry. INTRODUCTION The adaptive control (Åström and Wittenmark 1989) is not new control technique but his advantages could be found in the big theoretical background and usability to cooperate with other control approaches such as a robust control, a predictive control etc. Several methods used in adaptive control are introduced for example in (Bobal et al. 2005). The polynomial approach (Kucera 1993) in the control synthesis can be used for systems with negative properties from the control point of view such as nonlinear systems, nonminimum phase systems or systems with time delays. Moreover, the pole-placed method with spectral factorization satisfies basic control requirements such as disturbance attenuation, stability and reference signal tracking. Although the polynomial synthesis is considered for the continuous-time ELM, the recursive identification with exponential forgetting (Rao and Unbehauen 2005) runs in discrete time which is better from computation and programming point of view. This disagreement could be overcome with the use so called Delta (δ-) models (Middleton and Goodwin 2004) that belong the discrete-time models but parameters approaches to the continuous ones for the small sampling period (Stericker and Sinha 1993). The nonlinear plant in the verification part is represented by Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor with van der Vusse reaction inside and cooling in the jacket (Chen et al. 1995). The mathematical model of this reactor is described by the set of four nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) which can be easily solved with standard methods for numerical solving. All simulation studies were done on mathematical simulation software Matlab, version 6.5.1.	computation;computer cooling;control point (mathematics);elm;entity–relationship model;linear model;matlab;mathematical model;minimum phase;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;point of view (computer hardware company);polynomial;reactor (software);recursion;requirement;robust control;sampling (signal processing);simulation software;time complexity;usability	Jiri Vojtesek;Petr Dostál	2011		10.7148/2011-0501-0507	plug flow reactor model	Robotics	59.060405934993405	-5.771360770856529	168955

In the proposed approach, the genetic algorithm is used to identify the polynomial form or parameters of the external force or disturbance, including the amplitude, frequency and phase to compensate for nonlinear phenomenon such as disturbance in the mechanical system. In compensating for the nonlinear phenomenon, a piecewise linearization of the approximation polynomial is performed and the genetic algorithm optimization process is then used to identify the parameters of the polynomial function. The simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed automatic welding control system provides an effective means of compensating for the effects of the external force or disturbance and therefore results in an enhanced welding performance.	genetic algorithm	Cheng-Yu Wu;Pi-Cheng Tung	2008	J.

f6877989e754a10750aa7d6fdcea8fd017b75c51	towards the identification of heat induction in chip removing processes via an optimal control approach		This paper presents a linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) approach for solving inverse heat conduction problems (IHCPs) arising in production processes like chip removing or drilling. The inaccessibility of the processed area does not allow the measuring of the induced temperature. Hence the reconstruction of the heat source based on given measurements at accessible regions becomes necessary. Therefore, a short insight into the standard treatment of an IHCP and the related LQR design is provided. The main challenge in applying LQR control to the IHCP is to solve the differential Riccati equation. Here, a model order reduction approach is used in order to reduce the system dimension. The numerical results will show the accuracy of the approach for a problem based on data given by practical measurements.	optimal control	Norman Lang;Jens Saak;Peter Benner;Steffen Ihlenfeldt;Steffen Nestmann;Klaus Schädlich	2015	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-015-0608-9	control engineering;mathematical optimization;linear-quadratic regulator;engineering;control theory	SE	57.43615132768137	-3.5022330784822744	171505

This controller is initially trained to recognize the pattern of dynamic power demand from a consumption source. The power demand is the driving force in current production from the fuel cell, which in turn increases the temperature of the fuel cell stack. This temperature change is controlled by changing the flow rate of cooling water through the fuel cell stack. The results show that the neural network controller has excellent performance in maintaining the stack temperature at the desired set-point despite significant fluctuations in power demand.	artificial neural network;backpropagation;computer cooling;hydrogen;network interface controller;water cooling	Syed Misbahuddin;M.

7dfaf5571813718b0c5df07497d222a6ded674d4	robust miso control of propofol-remifentanil anesthesia guided by the neurosense monitor		This paper describes the design and evaluation of a controller for multi-input single-output (MISO) propofol-remifentanil anesthesia, guided by feedback from a measure of depth-of-hypnosis (DOH). DOH monitors are commonly used in clinical practice to guide anesthetic dosing, however, there is currently no widely accepted nociception monitor to guide remifentanil (analgesic) infusion. Variability in the DOH measure has been associated with insufficient analgesia, and feasibility of closed-loop control of both propofol and remifentanil infusion using DOH feedback has been demonstrated. However, DOH variability does not provide a measure of analgesia in the absence of stimulation. Consequently, control of the opioid-hypnotic balance is lost in control systems relying on DOH feedback alone. The proposed design overcomes this limitation by introducing a second, indirect control objective. This paper defines clinical design specifications to achieve adequate anesthesia in a wide range of clinical cases, proposes a modification of the habituating control framework, and presents methods to translate the clinical objectives into control objectives within this framework. The developed design methodology provides a controller that: 1) meets the clinical objectives; 2) is robust to interpatient variability, both in single-input single-output and MISO operation; 3) is robust to nonlinear drug interactions; 4) gives the user control of the opioid-hypnotic balance in the absence of stimulation and in the presence of input saturation; and 5) improves disturbance rejection following nociceptive stimulation. The MISO system performed as designed in 80 clinical cases.	control system;control theory;heart rate variability;inter-rater reliability;interaction;nonlinear system;overshoot (signal);rejection sampling;setpoint (control system);simulation interoperability standards organization;spatial variability;system analysis;usability;user interface	Klaske van Heusden;John Mark Ansermino;Guy Albert Dumont	2018	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2017.2735359	control theory;anesthetic;user control;propofol;control theory;robustness (computer science);control engineering;mathematics;clinical practice;anesthesia;remifentanil;control system	Embedded	55.12339458406183	-8.0712574111926	175745

The model identification is based on the extended structure and parameter identification procedure by means of product-space fuzzy clustering. It compensates the insensibility of the clustering procedure with respect to the parameters that are maintained at a constant level during the batch fermentation.

In order to detect the occurred faults at the appropriate time, avoid heavy economic losses, ensure safe system operation, prevent damage to adjacent relevant systems, and facilitate timely repair of failed components; a fault detection system (FDS) is required. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have gained a noticeable position in FDSs and they have been widely used for modeling of complex dynamical systems. One method for designing an FDS is to prepare a dynamic neural model emulating the normal system behavior. By comparing the outputs of the real system and neural model, incidence of the faults can be identified. In this paper, by utilizing a comprehensive dynamic model which contains both mechanical and electrical components of the WECS, an FDS is suggested using dynamic RNNs. The presented FDS detects faults of the generator's angular velocity sensor, pitch angle sensors, and pitch actuators. Robustness of the FDS is achieved by employing an adaptive threshold. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is capable to detect the faults shortly and it has very low false and missed alarms rate.	angularjs;artificial neural network;cns disorder;complex dynamics;dynamical system;electronic component;emulator;family computer disk system;fault detection and isolation;incidence matrix;mathematical model;neural network simulation;pitch (music);recurrent neural network;velocity (software development);sensor (device)	Nasser Talebi;Mohammad Ali Sadrnia;Ahmad Darabi	2014		10.1155/2014/580972	computer simulation;energy transfer;simulation;artificial intelligence;machine learning;wind	Robotics	53.818865818420214	-9.775274092474447	176935

The common occurrence of delay or temporary absence of sensor signals raises new safety demands in order to guarantee passenger immunity. In this paper a new method for the handling of delayed and missing vehicle dynamics sensor signals by use of Markov Chains is introduced. The performance of this method in combination with a vehicle observer based on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) technique is validated by simulation.

For the analysis of a megawatt-class wind-energy conversion system (WECS), this research adopts the H∞ control theory in designing an advanced control paradigm that accomplishes the dual purpose of energy capture optimization, as well as power train cyclic load alleviation by mitigating against wind-speed fluctuations. This work is presented in two parts: The first details the modeling of the subsystems of WECS and introduces the multiobjective H∞ control concept, and the second deals with the implementation of the control paradigm. Presented herein is a modeling approach of individual subsystems as a basis for devising the unified control strategy for a 2-MW grid-connected pitch-regulated variable-speed WECS that incorporates a doubly fed induction generator. The credibility of the archetype, to establish the argument that the models produce sound insights and comparable results to data from the real system, is ascertained via validation.	advanced process control;control theory;intelligent control;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;programming paradigm;simulation	Endusa Billy Muhando;Tomonobu Senjyu;Aki Uehara;Toshihisa Funabashi	2011	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2010.2045317	wind power;control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;gain scheduling;intelligent control	Visualization	57.324938089891404	-3.8902405002678937	179398

With the recent developments in the area of global optimization, it has been made possible to obtain the optimal values of the design parameters systematically. Nevertheless, it is well known that unless a priori knowledge is available about the optimization search-domain, most of the available time-domain objective functions may result in undesirable solutions. It is consequently important to provide guidelines on how these parameters affect the closed-loop behavior. As a result, some alternative objective functions are presented for the time-domain optimization of the fuzzy controllers, and the design parameters of a PID-type fuzzy controller are tuned by using the proposed time-domain objective functions. Finally, the real-time application of the optimal PID-type fuzzy controller is investigated on the robust stabilization of a laboratory active magnetic bearing system. The experimental results show that the designed PID-type fuzzy controllers provide much superior performances than the linear on-board controllers while retaining lower profiles of control signals.	fuzzy concept;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithm;global optimization;heuristic;imperialist competitive algorithm;independent computing architecture;loss function;mathematical optimization;on-board data handling;optimal design;optimization problem;pid;particle swarm optimization;performance;real-time clock;real-time computing;software release life cycle	Amin Noshadi;Juan Shi;Wee Sit Lee;Peng Shi;Akhtar Kalam	2015	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-015-1996-7	genetic algorithm;defuzzification;computer science;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;machine learning;control theory	EDA	60.76992052692535	-7.125612982715041	182659

A cascade combination of simplest 4-rule fuzzy logic controller FLC and an nth degree polynomial is proposed as an IASFLC to approximate the control characteristics of a 49-rule FLC. The scheme is based on minimizing the sum of square errors between the control outputs of a 49-rule FLC and a simplest 4-rule FLC in the entire range of universe of discourse UOD. The coefficients of compensating polynomial are evaluated by solving instantaneous square error equations at various test points in the entire UOD. This IASFLC maps the output of a 49-rule FLC with absolute deviation of less than 5%. The proposed IASFLC is used to control the dc link voltage of a three phase shunt active power filter APF. A detailed analysis is performed during transient and steady state conditions to check power quality PQ and dynamic performance indices. The performance of proposed IASFLC is compared with a 49-rule FLC and approximated simplest fuzzy logic controller ASFLC based on minimization of the deviation at central values of membership functions MFs. It is found comparatively better for harmonic and reactive compensation with a comparable dynamic response. The memory requirement and computational time of proposed IASFLC are less than the ASFLC.	approximation algorithm;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic	Rambir Singh;Asheesh K.

The dosage to use for treatment of the HIV is determined by the appearance of the days of the patient by the experience and the observation data of the doctor, and it may be said that it is the always most suitable dosage. Therefore it is thought that if I can perform system control of the HIV, I can decrease HIV ideally and I can reach the few dosages of the burden for a patient. So, I can contribute to medical care.

The multi-variable control approach with model predictive control (MPC) is proposed in this study. The proposed algorithm was tested for control of a milk pasteurization process in four cases of simulation such as set point tracking, model mismatch, difference control and prediction horizons, and time sample. The results for the proposed algorithm show the well performance in keeping both the milk and water temperatures at the desired set points without any oscillation and overshoot and giving less drastic control action compared to the cascade generic model control (GMC) strategy.

An important difficulty in applying this technique to real systems is dealing with the uncertainties associated with the system itself and with the measurements. In this paper, this uncertainty is taken into account by the use of intervals for the parameters of the model and for the measurements. The method that is proposed in this paper checks the consistency between the system's behavior, obtained from the measurements, and the model's behavior; if they are inconsistent, then there is a fault. The problem of detecting faults is stated as a quantified real constraint satisfaction problem, which can be solved using the modal interval analysis (MIA). MIA is used because it provides powerful tools to extend the calculations over real functions to intervals. To improve the results of the detection of the faults, the simultaneous use of several sliding time windows is proposed. The result of implementing this method is semiqualitative tracking (SQualTrack), a fault-detection tool that is robust in the sense that it does not generate false alarms, i.e., if there are false alarms, they indicate either that the interval model does not represent the system adequately or that the interval measurements do not represent the true values of the variables adequately. SQualTrack is currently being used to detect faults in real processes. Some of these applications using real data have been developed within the European project advanced decision support system for chemical/petrochemical manufacturing processes and are also described in this paper.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;antivirus software;bit array;branch and bound;checking (action);computation;constraint satisfaction problem;cyclic redundancy check;decision support system;dynamical system;fault detection and isolation;interval arithmetic;level of measurement;microsoft windows;modal logic;sensor;window function	Joaquim Armengol;Josep Vehí;Miguel Ángel Sainz;Pau Herrero;Esteban R.

We first formulate a thermal dynamics and an associated optimization problem. An optimization dynamics is then designed based on a standard primal-dual algorithm, and its strict passivity is proved. We then design a local controller and prove that the physical dynamics with the controller is ensured to be passivity-short. Based on these passivity results, we interconnect the optimization and physical dynamics, and prove convergence of the room temperatures to the optimal ones defined for unmeasurable disturbances. Finally, we demonstrate the present algorithms through simulation.	diffusing update algorithm;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation	Takeshi Hatanaka;Xuan Zhang;Wenbo Shi;Minghui Zhu;Na Li	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA)	10.1109/CCTA.2017.8062598	control engineering;mathematical optimization;simulation;engineering;control theory	EDA	58.743169287005024	-3.17062919835144	188002

In this research, two other control options for high speed machine were designed based on the optimal output feedback and H∞ output feedback control methods to improve the radical and axial position regulation of AMB. The output feedback control gain matrix with the minimum performance index is obtained by solving the Riccati equation and fed back to the system in order to achieve the system’s performance. The above designed controllers can efficiently regulate the radial and axial directions position deviation of for AMB systems.

9d6fd67a0f070f21c8006797c493d26b2e302c03	early phase design-optimization of mechatronic systems		Methodologies on design optimization of mechatronic systems are usually based on consecutive methods, i.e., the procedure of physical design, control and optimization of a system is performed step by step to achieve the final goal. This paper is built upon previous works on developing a toolbox to integrate several engineering backgrounds in early design phase to avoid time and cost consuming iterations in later deign steps. The previous methodology was mainly applicable for linear one-degree of freedom systems without time-variant dynamics. In this paper, the method is upgraded towards covering concepts on nonlinear systems where extra degrees of freedom are added to the system. Additionally, the library of the mentioned toolbox is extended to include ball-screw drive and rotational rigid beam components in terms of physical design, dynamic and static models to examine the feasibility of the design. A conceptual nonlinear multi-degree design case is presented and linearized at specified operational points in the supported software framework and the implemented models are verified in both SimMechanics and Simulink.	iteration;mathematical optimization;mechatronics;multidisciplinary design optimization;nonlinear system;physical design (electronics);program optimization;simulink;software framework	Fariba Rahimi;Lei Feng;Jan Wikander;Daniel Frede	2017		10.1145/3149827.3149838	software framework;toolbox;control engineering;physical design;nonlinear system;mechatronics;computer science	EDA	56.91128607601065	-3.4159681224909533	193715

This model is initially derived through analysing energy transfer, heat exchange and mass flow balances of a coal mill. Evolutionary computational techniques are then adopted to identify the unknown system parameters. After the model was tested offline, it was converted into a discrete-time form for the purpose of online implementation. A shared-memory technique is employed to accommodate the measurement data dynamically in realtime, which provides a generic platform to communicate with different software environments used by different mill plants. A user-friendly interface is designed to satisfy the requirement specified by the plant engineers. The model can be used to improve the combustion process control and fault diagnosis.

7badf561bf74b6893dc11a4220081c35111d6696	using modified centroidal voronoi tessellations in kernel partitioning for optimal actuator and sensor selection of parabolic pdes with static output feedback		This work presents a methodology that utilizes computational geometry methods to design controllers and actuators in spatially distributed systems governed by partial differential equations. Utilizing earlier works on the modification of Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (CVT), a methodology is presented that simultaneously designs the actuator and sensor locations, and the static output feedback. This approach which significantly reduces the control design complexity firsts assumes a virtual idealized actuator to design the optimal feedback gain. Then the modified CVT is applied to both the virtual actuator and the feedback kernel to obtain both the actuator and sensor locations, respectively. Subsequently, a static feedback gain matrix is designed in order to implement a static output feedback that approximates the idealized input and optimal gain with full state information. Extensive and detailed numerical studies are included to clarify the many aspects of the proposed methodology.	block cipher mode of operation;centroidal voronoi tessellation;computational geometry;control engineering;distributed computing;kernel (operating system);numerical analysis;parabolic antenna;sensor;voronoi diagram	Michael A.

The idea of impulsive control is discussed using a mathematical model. The HIV dynamic model includes the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antiretroviral drugs. Consequently, the dosage of drugs are the control inputs. As they are administrated at discrete time instants this naturally yields an impulsive control problem for a nonlinear continuous-time system. Exploiting this model we emulate recently reported clinical experiments via numerical simulation and analyse the experimental results. It is noted that this modeling approach can help to provide a theoretical explanation of the clinical result. Throughout this paper it is pointed out that the protocol of the experiment could imply the enhancement of the immune response against HIV.	boosting (machine learning);computer simulation;control system;emulator;experiment;mathematical model;nonlinear system;numerical analysis	Hyeygjeon Chang;Claude H.

In this approach, a selection of membership functions makes much effect upon the model performance. It is usually determined by the expert's knowledge for the objective systems. However, it is often difficult to give appropriate membership functions for unknown complex dynamical system without any prior information. In this paper, we deal with the approach to give appropriate fuzzy membership functions based on the observed input and output data using genetic algorithm. Then, an application to identification of nonlinear systems is considered and the availability of the proposed method is illustrated by some numerical examples.	complex dynamics;dynamical system;genetic algorithm;input/output;membership function (mathematics);nonlinear system identification;numerical analysis;numerical method;objective-c;systems modeling	Toshiharu Hatanaka;Yoshio Kawaguchi;Katsuji Uosaki	2004	Proceedings of the 2004 Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE Cat.

However, in open-loop control, the stability issue may arise due to the so-called casing heading phenomenon. Artificial Gas-lift process is a nonlinear multivariable time varying system with slow dynamics. Therefore, model predictive control (MPC) can be considered as a good candidate for closed-loop control of such a process. In this work, we present a new design of subspace predictive controller (SPC) for gas-lift process. The SPC is a data driven algorithm, using linear predictor to predict future output based on process input and output data. The linear prediction model is derived offline. Thereby, the key future of the proposed approach is that precise knowledge of the model and on-line optimization are not required to derive the control law. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed controller is demonstrated in simulation, and compared with a robust nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC).	algorithm;control theory;course (navigation);input/output;kerrison predictor;mathematical optimization;model–view–controller;nonlinear acoustics;nonlinear system;online and offline;online optimization;optimal control;performance;simulation	Shi Jing;Rachid Errouissi;Ahmed Al-Durra;Igor Boiko	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2015.7320772	control engineering;simulation;engineering;automatic control;control theory;model predictive control	Robotics	58.8389635969734	-6.614498323413267	196715

The parameter estimation algorithm runs continuously to allow the model of the system to be updated at each sample interval as changes occur in the process and the algorithm estimates the unknown process parameters recursively based on the minimisation of the least squares error. The estimated parameters are validated with actual parameters of first and second discrete single input single output SISO linear processes. The proposed pipelined design of STC is analysed with the second order process. The process is controlled by RST controller and its parameters are identified with minimum degree pole placement technique. The design is implemented in very high-speed integrated circuit hardware description language VHDL and is tested using Virtex IV device 4VLX200ff1513. The maximum operating frequency of pipelined design of STC is 146.735 MHz.		S. P.

The controller, is based on Actor-Critic (AC) learning and is inspired by the principles of reinforcement learning and optimal control theory. The main characteristics of the proposed controller are (i) simultaneous adjustment of both the insulin basal rate and the bolus dose, (ii) initialization based on clinical procedures, and (iii) real-time personalization. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of glycemic control has been investigated in silico in adults, adolescents and children under open-loop and closed-loop approaches, using announced meals with uncertainties in the order of ±25% in the estimation of carbohydrates. The results show that glucose regulation is efficient in all three groups of patients, even with uncertainties in the level of carbohydrates in the meal. The percentages in the A+B zones of the Control Variability Grid Analysis (CVGA) were 100% for adults, and 93% for both adolescents and children. The AC based controller seems to be a promising approach for the automatic adjustment of insulin infusion in order to improve glycemic control. After optimization of the algorithm, the controller will be tested in a clinical trial.		Elena Daskalaki;Peter Diem;Stavroula G.
