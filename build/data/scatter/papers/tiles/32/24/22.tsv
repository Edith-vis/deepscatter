However, the power dissipation in such receivers is dominated by the ADC. ADCs in serial links employ signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and effective-number-of-bit (ENOB) as performance metrics as these are the standard for generic ADC design. This paper studies the use of information-based metrics such as bit-error-rate (BER) to design a BER-optimal ADC (BOA) for serial links. Channel parameters such as the m-clustering value and the threshold non-uniformity metric ht are introduced and employed to quantify the BER improvement achieved by a BOA over a conventional uniform ADC (CUA) in a receiver. Analytical expressions for BER improvement are derived and validated through simulations. A prototype BOA is designed, fabricated and tested in a 1.2 V, 90 nm LP CMOS process to verify the results of this study. BOA's variable-threshold and variable-resolution configurations are implemented via an 8-bit single-core, multiple-output passive digital-to-analog converter (DAC), which incurs an additional power overhead of <; 0.1% (approximately 50 μW). Measurement results show examples in which the BER achieved by the 3-bit BOA receiver is lower by a factor of 109 and 1010, as compared to the 4-bit and 3-bit CUA receivers, respectively, at a data rate of 4-Gb/s and a transmitted signal amplitude of 180 mVppd.	4-bit;8-bit;analog-to-digital converter;approximation algorithm;backplane;bit error rate;cmos;cpu power dissipation;call of duty: black ops;circuit complexity;cluster analysis;data rate units;digital-to-analog converter;distortion;effective number of bits;emoticon;equalization (communications);gigabyte;ibm common user access;input/output;like button;maxima and minima;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;overhead (computing);prototype;sinad;sinadr;serial communication;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;single-core;software portability;throughput;x.690	Yingyan Lin;Min-Sun Keel;Adam C.

To operate over a wide range of sampling rates, an adaptive biasing technique is proposed to enhance both linearity and signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR) at low sampling rates. This ADC has been fabricated in a 0.18-¿m standard CMOS process. It achieves 62.3-dB spurious-free-dynamic range (SFDR) and 53.3-dB SNDR while being sampled at 10 MS/s and consuming 1.95 mW from a 1.8-V power supply, which obtains a figure of merit of 510 fJ/step. With the utilization of adaptive biasing, the SNDR increases from 53.3 to 56.4 dB at most when decreasing the sampling rate. In addition, its power consumption continuously reduces from 1.95 mW (10 MS/s) to 158.4 ¿W (100 kS/s).	analog-to-digital converter;biasing;cmos;comparator;decibel;distortion;effective number of bits;power supply;sinadr;sampling (signal processing);scalability;signal-to-noise ratio;spurious-free dynamic range;switched capacitor	Mu-Chen Huang;Shen-Iuan Liu	2010	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2009.2037259	electronic engineering;switched capacitor;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory	Visualization	59.61033967192562	50.57810395665835	181891
88e7456ddd2ee7f5ef957af6fcaead31381640cb	a 6.78 mhz active voltage doubler with near-optimal on/off delay compensation for wireless power transfer systems		This paper presents a fully integrated 6.78 MHz active voltage doubler with a near-optimal on/off delay compensation scheme, achieving the maximized AC to DC power conversion efficiency (PCE) and voltage conversion ratio (VCR) for implantable medical devices (IMDs). In the proposed active voltage doubler design, we build sampling-based feedback loops for the real-time active diode on/off delay compensation. The proposed active voltage doubler was designed with a standard CMOS 0.35 Mm process. It achieves a peak PCE of 92.2% with a 500 Ω load, and a peak VCR of 1.92 with a 2 kfí load, improved by 10% and 33%, respectively, when compared with the voltage doubler without the delay compensation scheme. The input range of this design is from 1 V to 1.7 V with a load range from 200 Ω to 2 ΚΩ.	cmos;diode;electric power conversion;feedback;real-time clock;sampling (signal processing);transformer;videocassette recorder;voltage doubler	Fangyu Mao;Yan Lu;U Seng-Pan;Rui P.

This paper reports on the demonstration of a new 128 x 128 CMOS APS with programmable multiresolution readout capability. By placing signal processing circuitry on the imaging focal plane, the image sensor can output data at varying resolutions which can decrease the computational load of downstream image processing. For instance, software intensive image pyramid reconstruction can be eliminated. The circuit uses a passive switched capacitor network to average arbitrarily large neighborhoods of pixels which can then be read out at any user-defined resolution by configuring a set of digital shift registers. The full resolution frame rate is 30 Hz with higher rates for all other image resolutions. The sensor achieved 80 dB of dynamic range while dissipating only 5 mW of power. Circuit error was less than -34 dB and introduced no objectionable fixed pattern noise or other artifacts into the image.	active pixel sensor;cmos;decibel;downstream (software development);dynamic range;electronic circuit;focal (programming language);fixed-pattern noise;image processing;image sensor;multiresolution analysis;pyramid (image processing);shift register;signal processing;smart camera;switched capacitor	Sabrina E.

This paper reports on the design and implementation of a programmable and fully implantable microsystem that fulfills this purpose. The system design builds on our earlier work that relies on a sparse representation of the neural signals to combat the limited telemetry bandwidth when wireless communication with the external world is sought. The system has a multimodal processing capability to support a wide range of scenarios in real experimental conditions. A transmission link with rate-dependent compression and spike sorting strategy is shown to preserve information fidelity. At 32 channels sampled at 25 kHz, the power consumption of the system is 5.19 mW and has been implemented on a 5mm×5mm nano-FPGA, bringing its performance within the implantable power-size constraints for clinical applications.	8-bit;brain–computer interface;compression;field-programmable gate array;gnu nano;implants;information extraction;kilohertz;microelectrodes;multimodal interaction;neuroscience discipline;occur (action);sampling - surgical action;scalability;sorting;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;systems design;telemetry	Fei Zhang;Mehdi Aghagolzadeh;Karim G.

Single-slope ADCs have been used as column parallel ADCs for CMOS image sensors. When the TDC with resolution of n bits is adapted to the ADC, the conversion time is reduced by a factor of 2n. Applying the TDC that uses multi-phase-clock signal reduced the number of circuit elements, achieved consistency between the single-slope ADC and the TDC, and realized robust meta-stability. We designed a 12-bit ADC, which consists of the 3-bit TDC and the 9-bit-single-slope ADC, by using a 0.25-µm CMOS process. Through SPICE simulation, we confirmed our single-slop ADC to be more consistent, have more robust meta-stability, and achieve higher-speed ADC operation at 200-MHz clock than the conventional single-slope ADC.

It has a 400kHz reference frequency and 40kHz loop bandwidth such that 2GHz quadrature LO signals can be generated after a divide-by-two, with channel raster of 200kHz. The measured in-band phase noise is -74dBc/Hz @4kHz offset. A self-regulated charge pump is proposed to improve matching as well as charge sharing. Reference spurs are thereby kept below -55dBc over the VCO tuning voltage from rail to rail.

The transmitter uses a ΔΣ fractional-N PLL architecture. It transmits 2Mb/s GFSK and GMSK modulated signals and is compliant with the IEEE802.15.4 and Bluetooth 1.2 standards. The transmitter consumes 18mA at 3dBm output power and occupies 1.1mm2. The transmitter does not use any quantisation noise cancellation techniques leading to 60% die area and 50% power consumption savings compared to [1,2], yet meets the FCC emission regulations in restricted bands with 12dB margin. It uses a novel calibration system that maintains a worst-case RMS phase error of 8.4° for 2Mb/s GMSK in the presence of ±50% variation in the PLL closed-loop bandwidth (CLBW). The calibration system consumes 0.4mA for a period of 66µs, which is significantly less power-consuming than a recently reported scheme [3].	best, worst and average case;bluetooth;cmos;emphasis (telecommunications);modulation;phase-locked loop;quantization (signal processing);radio frequency;record management services;system on a chip;transceiver;transmitter	Hyman Shanan;Guido Retz;Kenneth Mulvaney;Philip Quinlan	2009	2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977487	transmitter;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	60.47029588263631	52.617213202375744	184988

However, a wider bandwidth reduces the effective oversampling ratio between update rate and loop bandwidth, making quantization error a much bigger noise contributor. A successful implementation of a wideband frequency synthesizer is in managing jitter and spurious performance. In this paper we present a new PLL architecture for bandwidth extension. By using clock squaring buffers with built-in offsets, multiple clock edges are extracted from a single reference cycle and utilized for phase update, thereby effectively forming a reference multiplier.

Aided by a single-bit pseudorandom noise (PN) injected to the ADC input, the calibration engine extracts all bit weights simultaneously to facilitate a digital-domain correction. The analog overhead associated with this technique is negligible and the conversion speed is fully retained (in contrast to [1] in which the ADC throughput is halved). A prototype 12bit 50-MS/s SAR ADC fabricated in 90-nm CMOS measured a 66.5-dB peak SNDR and an 86.0-dB peak SFDR with calibration, while occupying 0.046 mm2 and dissipating 3.3 mW from a 1.2-V supply. The calibration logic is estimated to occupy 0.072 mm2 with a power consumption of 1.4 mW in the same process.	12-bit;analog-to-digital converter;bitwise operation;cmos;digital-to-analog converter;overhead (computing);pipeline (computing);prototype;pseudorandom noise;sinadr;spurious-free dynamic range;successive approximation adc;throughput	Wenbo Liu;Pingli Huang;Yun Chiu	2012	Proceedings of the IEEE 2012 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference	10.1109/CICC.2012.6330694	electronic engineering;calibration;successive approximation adc;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;approximation theory	EDA	59.34132615335429	50.991981191144596	186166

A further innovative aspect of our prototype is that it takes advantage of a chaotic pulse-amplitude modulation as driving signal, instead of a triangular signal as in all spread-spectrum generators proposed so far in the literature for SATA-II. In this way, we are able to obtain the optimal theoretical electromagnetic-interference reduction by avoiding the periodicity of the modulated clock and completely flattening the peaks in the power spectral density. We also show that, despite the fact that such an unconventional aperiodic modulating signal is used, the clock can be recovered by exploiting a standard clock and data recovery circuit at the receiver side of the SATA-II bus. The circuit prototype has been implemented in 0.13-μm CMOS technology and achieves a peak reduction greater than 14 dB measured at RBW = 100 kHz, which is better than any other prototypes presented in the literature. The estimated random jitter is 5.4 psrms, while the chip active area is 0.27 0.78 × mm2 and the power consumption is as low as 14.7 mW.	cmos;clock generator;clock recovery;data recovery;emi;interference (communication);linux pam;modulation;parallel ata;phase-locked loop;prototype;quasiperiodicity;serial ata;spectral density	Fabio Pareschi;Gianluca Setti;Riccardo Rovatti	2010	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2010.2048771	electronic engineering;telecommunications;clock domain crossing;clock skew;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;self-clocking signal;clock drift;synchronous circuit;clock gating;digital clock manager;cmos;cpu multiplier	EDA	59.87585913495294	52.505881501393034	186265

Then, analytical criteria are formulated to progressively reduce the bias currents through the stages without affecting the divider operation speed, reducing the overall power consumption. The analytical approach allows for a deeper understanding of the power-delay trade-off involved in the design.

The adaptive feature enables always-on imaging operation with extremely low power consumption for extended lifetime of wireless image sensor nodes and provides optimum images in a wide range of illuminations. For adaptive operation, the sensor employs reconfigurable modes of operation. Most of time, the sensor is in a monitoring mode, which keeps imaging at extremely low power consumption. The sensor turns into a high-sensitivity imaging mode or a wide dynamic range imaging mode when illumination varies and sufficient power supply is available from energy harvesting. The sensor changes its operation back to the monitoring mode in order to save energy in the battery. The sensor operates at 1.36 μW/frame in the monitoring mode from harvested energy and provides high-sensitive (24 V/lx·sec) and wide dynamic range images (99.2 dB) at 867 μW in battery operation. The chip achieved power FOM of 15.4 pW/pixel·frame in 0.18 μm technology.	block cipher mode of operation;cmos;comparator;dynamic range;high availability;image sensor;normal mode;overhead (computing);pitch (music);power supply;range imaging;signal-to-noise ratio;social inequality	Jaehyuk Choi;Seokjun Park;Jihyun Cho;Euisik Yoon	2015	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2015.2420678	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;sensor node;computer science;image sensor;cmos sensor;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;electro-optical sensor	Mobile	56.61995256741535	47.89303539275529	187209

We analyze different approaches for IRN minimization and propose solution based on the on-chip analogue noise averaging. The proposed approach allows for almost 2.5 times IRN minimization with only 8 time power consumption increase whereas other on-chip analogue methods provides much less noise minimization efficiency. The method is confirmed by measurements of 8-channel integrated circuit fabricated in 180nm commercial process. The chip is composed of the 8-recording channels that are individually digitally assisted for enlarging IC functionality. The recording part is divided into two separate channels, i.e. an Action Potential (AP) stage and a Local Field Potential (LFP) stage. The voltage gain of the AP and LFP stages can be switched between 56/50 dB and 50/45 dB respectively. Corner frequencies of a particular stages can be digitally controlled in a wide range, i.e. the upper cut-off frequency can be changed in the 20 Hz - 2 kHz (LFP stage) while the lower cut-off frequency can be tuned at the 120 mHz - 3 kHz (LFP and AP stage). The upper cut-off frequency of the AP stage is equal to 6.9 kHz. A single recording channel is supplied from ±0.9 V and consumes about 4.8 μW of power. For a default channel configuration the Input Referred Noise is equal to 5.6 μV resulting in 4.38 of Noise Efficiency Factor (NEF) while for on-chip averaging mode enabled the IRN can be limited to 2.4 μV resulting in 5.3 of NEF.	action potential;effective method;experiment;integrated circuit;international conference on functional programming	Piotr Kmon;Pawel Grybos;Miroslaw Zoladz;Robert Szczygiel	2014	2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings	10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981733	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering	EDA	57.917865919024464	52.383191287795945	188118

The low-noise front-end allows accessing the WG conductance with very high sensitivity and tracking its variation upon changes of the photon flux with a resolution better than 10 pS, i.e., down to -30 dBm in optical intensity. Each electronic chain features a capacitive-feedback amplifier with a bias-handling network based on subthreshold transistors, showing -50-dBc harmonic distortion at up to few nanoamperes of input leakage current and double-balanced square-wave demodulators incorporating a low-pass limiter. To downscale the area consumption, four 8× multiplexers have been designed to address a total of 32 different optical probes, featuring a 4× MOS multiplexer cell to drop out off-phase spurious injections. The ASIC opens the way to multipoint monitoring and reconfiguration in photonic systems with many sensing sites, demonstrating the suitability of this solution for the closed-loop control of complex photonic circuits.	amplifier;application-specific integrated circuit;cmos;characteristic impedance;conductance (graph);control theory;dbm;distortion;downscaling;front and back ends;limiter;lock (computer science);low-pass filter;multi-function printer;multiplexer;multipoint ground;nominal impedance;prototype;ring modulation;sensor;spectral leakage;transistor	Pietro Ciccarella;Marco Carminati;Giorgio Ferrari;Davide Bianchi;Stefano Grillanda;Francesco Morichetti;Andrea Melloni;Marco Sampietro	2016	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2016.2538338	waveguide;electronic engineering;photonics;silicon photonics;electrical engineering;optoelectronics;capacitance;optical amplifier	EDA	57.04727669152778	49.827016572043014	188487

Up to now the bottleneck for the application of this technique was the possibility of realizing a large number of very-fast read-out channels with reduce power consumption. Typical time separation between each ionization act in a helium-based gas mixture is from a few ns to a few tens of ns. Thus the read-out interface has to be able to process such a high-speed signals. In this paper, the first realization of a CMOS 0.13µm integrated readout circuit, including a fast variable gain amplifier (VGA) with 160MHz bandwidth is designed for the central tracker of a future collider (ILC, super-B). The VGA circuit has been optimized for low power consumption. Moreover, it presents a programmable power consumption (8.4mA, 9.4mA, 10.6mA) according to the gain setting (0dB, 10dB, 20dB). The design issues and the measured performance associated to this architecture are discussed.	cmos;helium;system camera;variable-gain amplifier;video graphics array	Stefano D'Amico;Marcello De Matteis;Franco Grancagnolo;Marco Panareo;Roberto Perrino;Gabriele Chiodini;Alessandro Corvaglia;Giuseppe Cocciolo;Andrea Baschirotto	2009	2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems - (ICECS 2009)	10.1109/ICECS.2009.5410823	electronic engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;physics	EDA	55.790947475311036	48.879771515045334	189464

However, the energy efficiency of ADCs is degraded by scaling up transistor widths in the building blocks for high speed, thus increasing the impact of intrinsic parasitics. Parallel schemes like multi-bit processing and interleaving [1], can ease the problems caused by scaling and lead to better efficiency if the hardware overhead is wisely reduced [2].

The amorphous nature of GIZO grants also a good uniformity, contrary to Low Temperature Polycrystalline Silicon (LTPS), which still offers the best mobility among large- area TFT technologies (μ~100cm2Λ/s). The optical transparency and the relative- ly low fabrication temperature (<;150°C) make this technology especially suitable for display backplanes and relative driving electronics [2], as well as for any kind of large-area applications on plastic foils, e.g. biomedical sensors, non-volatile memories [3], RFIDs [4], etc.	backplane;circuit complexity;indium gallium zinc oxide;low-temperature polycrystalline silicon;non-volatile memory;semiconductor;sensor;spurious-free dynamic range;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display	Daniele Raiteri;Fabrizio Torricelli;Kris Myny;Manoj Nag;Bas van der Putten;Edsger C.

Analysis of APDs biased below their breakdown voltage employed in single-photon counting mode is also discussed, showing a potentially interesting alternative to existing Geiger-mode APDs. An overview of the recently presented gated pinned avalanche photodiode pixel concept is provided, as well as the first experimental results on a 8 × 16 pixel test array. Full feasibility of the proposed pixel concept is not demonstrated; however, informative data is obtained from the sensor operating under -32 V substrate bias and clearly exhibiting wavelength-dependent gain in frontside illumination. The readout of the chip designed in standard 130 nm CMOS technology shows no dependence on the high-voltage bias. Readout noise level of 15 e - rms, full well capacity of 8000 e - , and the conversion gain of 75 µV / e - are extracted from the photon-transfer measurements. The gain characteristics of the avalanche junction are characterized on separate test diodes showing a multiplication factor of 1.6 for red light in frontside illumination.	avalanche effect;avalanches;biasing;cmos;diode;disintegration (morphologic abnormality);exhibits as topic;extraction;gated community;illumination (image);information;multiplication;noise (electronics);photons;pixel;benefit;pamidronate;voltage;wavelength	Tomislav Resetar;Koen De Munck;Luc Haspeslagh;Maarten Rosmeulen;Andreas Süss;Robert Puers;Chris Van Hoof	2016		10.3390/s16081294	electronic engineering;single-photon avalanche diode;optoelectronics;image sensor;optics;cmos;physics;pixel;avalanche photodiode	Vision	55.01190657742218	49.12645965756144	190662

Its novel architecture features multiple parallel sub-DAC unit cores. Their various combinations deliver smart flexibility in: performance, functionality, power management, design reuse, and smartness. The parallel sub-DAC units can be used together or separately to optimize the performance of a targeted mixed-signal application. Unused sub-DAC units can be switched off to optimize the power consumption. The new parallel sub-DACs architecture facilitates a new calibration algorithm. This algorithm together with small calibrating DACs and a current comparator enables the realization of the first fully integrated self-calibration start-up method that corrects the mismatch errors of all binary and unary current sources. The presented self-calibrated flexible DAC achieves measured linearity of better than 12-bit, while occupying small silicon area due to the intrinsic 9-bit accuracy of the DAC unit core.	12-bit;algorithm;bitwise operation;cmos;comparator;current source;digital-to-analog converter;mixed-signal integrated circuit;multi-core processor;power management;unary operation	Georgi I.

A Near-VT MICS-band OOK transmitter sends the synchronized local sensor data back to the base-station in its pre-defined TDMA slot. For an energy-harvested local VDD=0.56V, measurements demonstrate full functionality over 1.4m between the base-station and four worn sensors, including two that are NLOS. The sensitivity of the RF energy harvesting and the wireless clock synchronization are measured at -8dBm and -35dBm, respectively.

974ecb80712f401d5b513a75af3c6cbf8c84c183	a low-power and low-voltage power management strategy for on-chip micro solar cells		Fundamental characteristics of on-chip micro solar cell (MSC) structures were investigated in this study. Several MSC structures using different layers in three different CMOS processes were designed and fabricated. Effects of PN junction structure and process technology on solar cell performance were measured. Parameters for low-power and low-voltage implementation of power management strategy and boost converter based circuits utilizing fractional voltage maximum power point tracking (FVMPPT) algorithm were determined. The FVMPPT algorithm works based on the fraction between the maximum power point operation voltage and the open circuit voltage of the solar cell structure.This ratio is typically between 0.72 and 0.78 for commercially available poly crystalline silicon solar cells that produce several watts of power under typical daylight illumination. Measurements showed that the fractional voltage ratio is much higher and fairly constant between 0.82 and 0.85 for on-chipmono crystalline siliconmicro solar cell structures that producemicrowatts of power.Mono crystalline silicon solar cell structures were observed to result in better power fill factor (PFF) that is higher than 74% indicating a higher energy harvesting efficiency.

The main purpose of the device is to monitor the hermeticity of micro-packages for implanted integrated circuits and to ensure their safe operation by monitoring the operating temperature and humidity on-chip. The smart sensor has two modes of operation, in which either the temperature or humidity is converted into a digital code representing a frequency ratio between two oscillators. This ratio is determined by the ratios of the timing capacitances and bias currents in both oscillators. The reference oscillator is biased by a current whose temperature dependency is complementary to the proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) current. For the temperature measurement, this results in an exceptional normalized sensitivity of about 0.77%/°C at the accepted expense of reduced linearity.

An impact of the supply voltage fluctuations, including voltage drop and overshoot, on logic circuit delay is evaluated as a change of oscillation frequency. The TSRO is designed using standard logic cells so that it can be placed almost anywhere in a digital circuit wherein supply voltage fluctuation is concerned. We also propose a new procedure for reconstructing supply voltage waveform. The procedure enables us to accurately monitor time-dependent, effective supply voltages. The -1 dB bandwidth of the TSRO is simulated to be 15.7 GHz, and measured time resolution is 131 ps. Measurement results of a test chip using 90-nm standard CMOS process successfully proved the feasibility of both delay degradation and effective supply voltage fluctuation measurements. Measurement of spatial voltage drop fluctuation is achieved.	elegant degradation;power supply;quantum fluctuation;ring oscillator	Takumi Uezono;Kazuya Masu;Takashi Sato	2010	IEICE Transactions		electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;78xx;electrical engineering;switched-mode power supply;digital electronics	Arch	57.961173626831425	48.506978837270346	193643

To enhance locking range of the ADMDLL, we proposed the self-estimated successive approximation register-controlled (SESAR) algorithm, which uses the frequency-estimation selector (FES) to avoid harmonic lock issue. In addition, the FES can reuse the delay line to reduce circuit area and power dissipation significantly. By using the stack effect, the proposed leakage-reduced delay unit can save 12% leakage power consumption. After locking, the dynamic frequency monitor window is proposed to compensation phase error caused by PVT variations. The proposed ADMDLL is capable of operating in wide supply voltage range from 0.3V to 1.0V. The power dissipation is only 520μW at 1.25GHz/1.0V, and 2.1 μW at 13MHz/0.3V, respectively.

In recent reports, time-interleaving techniques and multi-bit-per-cycle conversion have boosted speed to the GHz sampling range at low power consumption. However, to achieve SNR of >70dB at moderate sampling speed, SARs still need a lot of power, namely tens of mW [1-2]. In [1], a very high SNR of 90dB is achieved by a stage to amplify residue charge, which is one of the reasons for the 105mW power consumption at 12.5MS/s. In [2], 8× oversampling and a static current pre-amplifier for the comparator improve SNR to 88dB, but the ADC still consumes 66mW. In [3], digital calibration achieves an SNDR of 71dB at 3mW, but double conversion limits the sampling speed to 22.5MS/s.This paper describes a SAR ADC with 71dB SNDR that runs at 50MS/s and consumes 4.2mW. The ADC uses 3 SNDR-enhancement techniques that utilize noise and that have good compatibility to low-voltage fine digital processes.	amplifier;cmos;comparator;forward error correction;oversampling;performance per watt;preamplifier;sinadr;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;successive approximation adc	Takashi Morie;Takuji Miki;Kazuo Matsukawa;Yoji Bando;Takeshi Okumoto;Koji Obata;Shiro Sakiyama;Shiro Dosho	2013	2013 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487731	electronic engineering;synthetic aperture radar;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;preamplifier	EDA	59.5648462410785	50.952681812414006	195953

For the power-efficiency, the transceiver employs a dual-mode 10-level pulse amplitude modulation (10-PAM) technique enabling to transmit 4-bit per symbol. Since the operating frequency of the internal circuits is reduced by 4, the power dissipation of the transceiver is much reduced. In addition, compared with a standard 16-PAM technique, the dual-mode 10-PAM technique can reduce power dissipation by 62.5%. The transmitter including a pseudo random bit sequence (PRBS) generator, multiplexers, an encoder, and an output driver achieves 10-Gb/s data-rate with 235-mW power dissipation such that the figure of merit (FOM) of the transmitter part is 23.5 mW/(Gb/s). The receiver including a flash type analog-to-digital converter (ADC), a decoder, and output drivers achieves 10-Gb/s data-rate and 10 -12  BER with 190-mW power dissipation such that FOM of the receiver part is 19 mW/(Gb/s).

Compressive sensing (CS) is an efficient method for reducing the transmission data rate of sparse biological signals and lowering the power consumption of resource-constrained sensor nodes. However, recovering the original signal from compressed measurements is typically achieved by relatively complex and optimization-based algorithms, which is hardly suitable for real-time applications. The previously proposed multichannel CS scheme enables the area-efficient implementation of CS. In this brief, a low-power feature extraction method based on line length is directly applied in the compressed domain. This approach exploits the spatial sparsity of the signals recorded by adjacent electrodes of a sensor array and detects the seizure onset for every sixteen channels of the array. The proposed circuit architecture is implemented in a UMC 0.18-μm CMOS technology. Extensive performance analysis and design optimization enable a low-power and compact implementation. The proposed feature extractor reaches a perfect sensitivity of 100% for 420 h of clinical data containing 23 seizures from four patients, with an average false alarm rate of 0.34 h-1 for artifact-free channels, consuming 0.85 μW of power/channel at a compression rate of 16.	algorithm;cmos;compressed sensing;data rate units;feature extraction;feature model;low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;onset (audio);profiling (computer programming);randomness extractor;real-time clock;sparse matrix	Mahsa Shoaran;Claudio Pollo;Kaspar Schindler;Alexandre Schmid	2015	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2014.2387652	electronic engineering;speech recognition;capacitor;sensitivity;feature extraction;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;electrode;control theory;compressed sensing	EDA	55.44726444063654	52.13644231412228	197192

The system is self-contained, and only one digital clock is needed for the measurements. A system self-calibration algorithm is proposed to calibrate nonlinearities of the analog circuitry. The operation is robust over PVT variations since the delay information is normalized to the input clock period. To verify the proposed idea, two different digital-to-time converters performing the on-chip delay are measured and analyzed at 50-MHz clocking frequency with 0.65-ps standard time deviation per measurement.	algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;built-in self-test;cmos;clock rate;die shrink;digital delay generator;electronic circuit;elegant degradation;embedded system;first-order predicate;group delay and phase delay;image resolution;nonlinear system;rise time;time deviation;time-to-digital converter	Peng Chen;Xiongchuan Huang;Yue Chen;Lianbo Wu;Robert Bogdan Staszewski	2018	IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCSI.2018.2857999		EDA	60.127501946896864	49.84037226065272	197529

However, testing these ?? ADCs is becoming a costly task due to trends towards high-resolution implementations and associated increase in samples required to extract key specifications. In this paper, we propose a Built-In Self-Test (BIST) technique for high-resolution ?? ADCs. The technique, mostly digital, moves most of the test complexity to the digital domain, that is in-line with the philosophy of ?? modulation. Both the test signal generation and the output response analysis are performed on-chip. The stimulus, a sinusoid encoded in a binary bit stream, is chosen to have very high quality in the bandwidth of the converter with the quantization error laying outside of the analogue modulator's bandwidth. For the output response analysis, a sine-wave fitting algorithm is implemented on chip. For this, a digital sinusoidal stimulus of a very high precision is needed as a reference signal. In this paper, we generate this reference signal from the same input stimulus, by passing it through the digital filter already existing in the converter. Simulations results show the capability of this technique to obtain measurements of the SNDR (Signal-to-Noise-plus-Distortion Ratio) for a 16-bit audio ?? ADC.	built-in self-test;curve fitting;sinadr	Luís Rolíndez;Salvador Mir;Ahcène Bounceur;Jean-Louis Carbonéro	2006	J.

However, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are inherently subject to imperfections and variations such as those induced by mispositioned and metallic CNTs. These substantial imperfections and variations have prevented the demonstration of complex CNFET circuits until now. This paper presents the first demonstration of a subsystem, which is a complete capacitive sensor interface circuit, implemented entirely using CNFETs that can be fabricated reproducibly in a VLSI-compatible fashion. This is made possible by: 1) a digitally oriented interface architecture and 2) the imperfection-immune design paradigm, which combines design and processing techniques to successfully overcome CNT imperfections and variations. In addition to electrical measurements, we demonstrate correct operation of our CNFET circuitry by interfacing it with a sensor used to control a handshaking robot.	cmos;capacitive sensing;carbon cycle;classical nucleation theory;digital electronics;directshow;electronic circuit;experiment;handshaking;low-power broadcasting;programming paradigm;robot;sensor;upsizing (database);user interface;very-large-scale integration	Max M.

The concept of a conventional dithering algorithm is shown and its limitation is discussed. The proposed dithering algorithm comprises two steps: a data expansion and a three-bit reduction over eight frames. Three-bit reduction scheme over eight frames is proposed for the first time. This work shows that the color performance of LCD panels can be controlled by how to expand RGB data. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve full colors, i.e. 16,777,216 colors whereas the conventional one can support only 16,194,277 colors on LCD panel with only six-bit drivers. The color shift, represented by ¿u'v', of a twisted nematic (TN) panel adopting the proposed method becomes 0.015, which satisfy the regulation (¿u'v' < 0.02) on the color grayscale linearity.	12-bit;4-bit;8-bit;algorithm;color;dither;grayscale;image quality;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display;twisted nematic field effect	Seung-Woo Lee;Hyoungsik Nam	2009	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2009.5373779	rgb color model;computer vision;color depth;binary image;computer science;engineering;operating system;high color;liquid-crystal display;liquid crystal on silicon;8-bit color;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	53.774529339813405	48.77130013091004	198618
