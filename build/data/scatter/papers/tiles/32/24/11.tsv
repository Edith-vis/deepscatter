We describe the s-bot, a small autonomous robot with self-assembling capabilities that we designed and built within the project. Then we illustrate the cooperative object transport scenario that we chose to use as a test-bed for our robots. Last, we report on results of experiments in which a group of s-bots perform a variety of tasks within the scenario which may require selfassembling, physical cooperation and coordination.	autonomous robot;experiment;s-bot;self-assembly;swarm robotics;testbed	Marco Dorigo	2005		10.1109/SIS.2005.1501622	control engineering;simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence	Robotics	58.16323965145255	-25.670539126748228	198103

However, this step is sometimes hard to accomplish especially due to technical problems,... It is also difficult to reproduce the same scenario several times. Besides, some critical and/or forbidden scenarios cannot be tested in real. Thus, the comparison of several algorithms using the same experimental conditions is hard to realize. Considering that, it seems important to use simulation tools to perform scenarios with near reality conditions. The main problem with these tools is their distance with real conditions, since they deeply simplify the real world. This paper presents the architecture of the simulation/prototyping tool named Virtual Intelligent Vehicle Urban Simulator (vivus). The goal of vivus is thus to overcome the general drawbacks of classical solutions by providing the possibility of designing a vehicle virtual prototype with well simulated embedded sensors and physical properties. Part experiments made on linear platoon algorithms are exposed in this paper in order to illustrate the similarity between simulated results and those obtained in reality.	algorithm;embedded system;experiment;prototype;sensor;simulation	Franck Gechter;Jean-Michel Contet;Stéphane Galland;Olivier Lamotte;Abder Koukam	2012	Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory	10.1016/j.simpat.2012.02.001	control engineering;simulation;engineering;transport engineering;physical property;quantum mechanics	Robotics	60.268638836823435	-26.004615856137665	198439

The control and monitoring might need large sensor networks, and as a consequence, mobile sensory systems might be a more suitable solution. This paper describes the application of a heterogeneous robot team to monitor environmental variables of greenhouses. The multi-robot system includes both ground and aerial vehicles, looking to provide flexibility and improve performance. The multi-robot sensory system measures the temperature, humidity, luminosity and carbon dioxide concentration in the ground and at different heights. Nevertheless, these measurements can be complemented with other ones (e.g., the concentration of various gases or images of crops) without a considerable effort. Additionally, this work addresses some relevant challenges of multi-robot sensory systems, such as the mission planning and task allocation, the guidance, navigation and control of robots in greenhouses and the coordination among ground and aerial vehicles. This work has an eminently practical approach, and therefore, the system has been extensively tested both in simulations and field experiments.	addresses (publication format);aerial photography;aerobot;allocation;autonomous robot;avian crop;carbon dioxide;drug vehicle;experiment;exposure to humidity;gases;genetic heterogeneity;guidance, navigation, and control;height;map;mission control;navigation;numerous;religious missions;robot (device);simulation;simultaneous localization and mapping;unmanned aerial vehicle;algorithm;sensor (device);sensory system	Juan Jesús Roldán;Pablo García Auñón;Mario Garzón;Jorge de León;Jaime del Cerro;Antonio Barrientos	2016		10.3390/s16071018	sensory system;agriculture;greenhouse;simulation;environmental engineering;engineering;environmental monitoring;robotics;remote sensing	Robotics	55.75497765538225	-30.376071045771425	198931

Approaches for implementing both autonomous function and cooperative function are proposed and described. An online goal selection (OGS) algorithm is proposed for motion planning to guide autonomous behavior. To achieve cooperation, the robot society is organized as a decentralized market-like structure and a negotiation mechanism is used to resolve the task-sharing problem. A hybrid system architecture is implemented to combine both cooperative and autonomous functions. A simulation software environment is built for testing and evaluation.	mobile robot	Tao Wei Min;How Khee Yin	1998		10.1109/IROS.1998.724649	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;distributed computing;motion planning;robot control	Robotics	57.94946985440697	-25.015293756377858	198969

d6af94e29e51210e0870873ee3112ebbc09fcf03	3-d decentralized prioritized motion planning and coordination for high-density operations of micro aerial vehicles		This paper presents a decentralized motion planning method for multiple aerial vehicles moving among 3-D polygonal obstacles resembling an urbanlike environment. The algorithm combines a prioritized  $A^\star$  algorithm for high-level planning, along with a coordination method based on barrier functions for low-level trajectory generation and vehicle control. To this end, we extend the barrier functions method developed in our earlier work so that it treats 2-D and 3-D polygonal obstacles, and generates collision-free trajectories for the multiagent system. We furthermore augment the low-level trajectory generation and control with a prioritized  $A^\star$  path planning algorithm, in order to compute waypoints and paths that force the agents of lower priority to avoid the paths of the agents of higher priority, reducing thus congestion. This feature enhances further the performance of the barrier-based coordination, and results in shorter paths and time to the goal destinations. We finally extend the proposed control design to the agents of constrained double-integrator dynamics, compared with the single-integrator case in our earlier work. We assume that the obstacles are known to the agents, and that each agent knows the state of other agents lying in its sensing area. Simulation results in 2-D and 3-D polygonal environments, as well as experimental results with micro aerial vehicles (quadrotors) in an indoor lab environment demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.	aerial photography;agent-based model;algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;barrier function;control theory;high- and low-level;lyapunov fractal;motion planning;multi-agent system;network congestion;peering;recursion;simulation;television antenna;tree (data structure);unmanned aerial vehicle	Xiaobai Ma;Ziyuan Jiao;Zhenkai Wang;Dimitra Panagou	2018	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2017.2699165	computer vision;simulation	Robotics	56.37052671508517	-24.758446837824202	199632

This paper discusses on acquisition of multi-modal expression of slip consisting of vibration, pressure, and vision sensations through pick-up experiences. A sensor network is proposed to acquire the expression, whose learning ability is demonstrated by a real experiment. The applicability of the learned network is also demonstrated by experiments to realize adaptive picking	experiment;modal logic;robot	Yasunori Tada;Koh Hosoda	2006	2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1163/156855307780108213	control engineering;computer vision;simulation;wireless sensor network;computer science;engineering;tactile sensor	Robotics	61.02629717167905	-28.052782849792496	199780
2e2312f602f12e29cb0bf3515312cd9d901869b9	collaborator: a nonholonomic multiagent team for tasks in a dynamic environment	dynamic environment	In our previous work, we proposed a potential field-based hybrid path planning scheme for robot navigation that achieves complete coverage in various tasks. This paper is an extension of this work producing a multiagent framework, Collaborator, that integrates a high-level negotiation-based task allocation protocol with a low-level path planning method taking into consideration several real-world robot limitations such as nonholonomic constraints. Specifically, the proposed framework focuses on a class of complex motion planning problems in which robots need to cover the whole workspace, coordinate the accomplishment of a task, and dynamically change their roles to best fit the task. Applications in this class of problems include bomb detection and removal as well as rescuing of survivors from accidents or disasters. We have tested the framework in simulations of several tasks and have shown that Collaborator can satisfy nonholonomic constraints, cooperatively accomplish given tasks in an initially unknown dynamic environment while avoiding collision with other team members. Finally we prove that the proposed control laws are stable using the Lyapunov stability theory.	agent-based model;curve fitting;gradient;hp 48 series;high- and low-level;interdependence;lyapunov fractal;maxima and minima;motion planning;multi-agent system;qed (text editor);resultant;robot;robotic mapping;simulation;software framework;workspace	Jing Ren;Mark Green	2009	J.
