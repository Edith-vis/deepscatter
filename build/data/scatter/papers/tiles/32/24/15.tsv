The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is an optimal linear recursive algorithm that offers a solution to the filtering problem. The EKF is based on a first-order Taylor expansion to approximate the measurement and process models. This approach may cause the estimation process to diverge. Consequently, alternatives (e.g., the unscented Kalman filter, UKF) based on a fixed number of points to represent a Gaussian distribution have been introduced. The EKF and UKF have been applied for the identification of uncertainty in the attitude determination process for small satellites based on noisy measurements collected from Sun sensors and three-axis magnetometers. Simulation results indicate that the EKF and UKF perform equally well when small initial errors are present. However, when large errors are introduced, the UKF leads to a faster convergence and achieves a higher more accurate estimate of the state of the system.	approximation algorithm;extended kalman filter;first-order predicate;optic axis of a crystal;recursion (computer science);sensor;simulation	Mohamed Temam Nasri;Witold Kinsner	2013	2013 IEEE 12th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics and Cognitive Computing	10.1109/ICCI-CC.2013.6622242	control engineering;electronic engineering;invariant extended kalman filter;engineering;unscented transform;control theory;extended kalman filter	Robotics	55.36924781111997	3.6574713019802148	157000

a574abe441b5d28b153e97708dd40d17f59c1055	fault detection of nonlinear systems with missing measurements and censored data		In this paper, we present an extended Tobit Kalman filter that deals with fault detection problem in nonlinear systems with missing measurements and censored data. The missing measurements randomly occurring are regulated by individual random variables whose probability distributions are on the interval [0,1]. The censored data are characterized by the Tobit measurement model. The Tobit Kalman filter designed for linear systems with missing measurements is extended to nonlinear systems. The residual signals are generated by the extended Tobit Kalman filter and then evaluated to detect the occurrence of a fault. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed fault detection filter is illustrated by an example of leakage fault of a three-tank system.	algorithm;censor;censoring (statistics);clinical trial censoring;evaluation function;extravasation;fault detection and isolation;fault tolerance;kalman filter;linear system;nonlinear system;randomness;simulation;smoothing (statistical technique);spectral leakage;tobit model	Jie Huang;Xiao He	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8217005	probability distribution;kalman filter;statistics;control theory;nonlinear system;engineering;fault detection and isolation;censoring (statistics);linear system;tobit model;random variable	Robotics	57.585722723905654	0.9258650865096978	157075

We consider that variability on design parameters are represented by the parameter Mean and Standard Deviation. We propose in this article a new robust design approach that allows the designer either to find a robust solution in a reasonable execution time or to be informed of the non-existence of a robust solution for his design problem. The process combines a reformulation of the model to integrate parameter uncertainties and a deterministic optimization algorithm with new specifications based on robust objectives. The engineering application of an electrical actuator design is presented and used to show the implementation and the effectiveness of this new robust approach.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;run time (program lifecycle phase);spatial variability	Laura Picheral;Khaled Hadj-Hamou;Ghislain Remy;Jean Bigeon	2012	2012 25th IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)	10.1109/CCECE.2012.6334979	robust control;control engineering;algorithm design;econometrics;mathematical optimization;multidisciplinary design optimization;computer science;mathematical model;estimation theory;computational model;statistics;robustness	EDA	55.097810020802136	-0.00306296625603813	159525

Using the iterative adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) technique, the optimal battery control can be obtained iteratively. Considering the power constraints of the battery, a new non-quadratic form performance index function is established, which guarantees the value of the iterative control law not to exceed the maximum charging/discharging power of the battery to extend the service life of the battery.

In particular, our objective is to design a feedback control law that will steer the covariance matrix of the (random) terminal state vector of a stochastic linear system to a designated positive semi-definite matrix while minimizing the expected value of the control effort required for this âcovariance transitionâ or âSchroÌdinger bridgeâ subject to integral quadratic state inequality constraints. We address this problem by imbedding it into a one-parameter family of unconstrained covariance control problems that are more tractable, both analytically and computationally, than the original, constrained covariance control problem. In this way, the original problem is essentially reduced to a finite-dimensional optimal parameter selection problem, which can be addressed by means of gradient descent-type algorithms.	cobham's thesis;feedback;gradient descent;linear system;optimal control;selection algorithm;semiconductor industry;social inequality	Efstathios Bakolas	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7526814	matÃ©rn covariance function;estimation of covariance matrices;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;covariance intersection;covariance matrix;mathematical optimization;law of total covariance;combinatorics;cma-es;covariance;control theory;mathematics;rational quadratic covariance function;covariance function	ML	60.52637410973237	1.3451996179526453	162430
ad42a747d91fa27e851a6d8685840a76afebb7ea	an approximation approach for model predictive control of stochastic max-plus linear systems		Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a model-based control method based on a receding horizon approach and online optimization. In previous work we have extended MPC to a class of discrete-event systems, namely the max-plus linear systems, i.e., models that are âlinearâ in the maxplus algebra. Lately, the application of MPC for stochastic max-plus-linear systems has attracted a lot of attention. At each event step, an optimization problem then has to be solved that is, in general, a highly complex and computationally hard problem. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on decreasing the computational complexity of the optimization problem. To this end, we use an approximation approach that is based on the p-th raw moments of a random variable. This method results in a much lower computational complexity and computation time while still guaranteeing a good performance.	approximation;central processing unit;computation;computational complexity theory;convex function;convex optimization;linear system;loss function;matlab;mathematical optimization;multiphoton lithography;numerical analysis;numerical integration;online optimization;optimization problem;spatial variability;time complexity	Samira S.

fbc279a4471ed82e97b0ff4f76dcdac058aadf5d	state tracking of linear ensembles via optimal mass transport		We consider the problems of tracking an ensemble of indistinguishable agents with linear dynamics based only on output measurements. In this setting, the dynamics of the agents can be modeled by distribution flows in the state space and the measurements correspond to distributions in the output space. In this letter, we formulate the corresponding state estimation problem using optimal mass transport theory with prior linear dynamics, and the optimal solution gives an estimate of the state trajectories of the ensemble. For general distributions of systems this can be formulated as a convex optimization problem which is computationally feasible when the number of state dimensions is low. In the case where the marginal distributions are Gaussian, the problem is reformulated as a semidefinite programming problem and can be efficiently solved for tracking systems with a large number of states.	convex optimization;estimation theory;light transport theory;marginal model;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;semidefinite programming;state space;tracking system	Yongxin Chen;Johan Karlsson	2018	IEEE Control Systems Letters	10.1109/LCSYS.2018.2827001	interpolation;mathematical optimization;state space;marginal distribution;semidefinite programming;mathematics;tracking system;gaussian;convex optimization;optimal control	Robotics	59.93431289188051	1.4533324527928468	163269

Agents receive a sequence of random, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) signals, each of which individually may not be informative about the underlying true state, but the signals together are globally informative enough to make the true state identifiable. Using an optimization-based characterization of Bayesian learning as proximal stochastic gradient descent (with Kullback-Leibler divergence from a prior as a proximal function), we show how to efficiently use a distributed, online variant of Nesterov's dual averaging method to solve the estimation with purely local information. When the true state is globally identifiable, and the network is connected, we prove that agents eventually learn the true parameter using a randomized gossip scheme. We demonstrate that with high probability the convergence is exponentially fast with a rate dependent on the KL divergence of observations under the true state from observations under the second likeliest state. Furthermore, our work also highlights the possibility of learning under continuous adaptation of network which is a consequence of employing constant, unit stepsize for the algorithm.	aggregate data;estimation theory;gossip protocol;information;kullbackâleibler divergence;mathematical optimization;partial template specialization;randomized algorithm;stochastic gradient descent;time complexity;with high probability	Shahin Shahrampour;Ali Jadbabaie	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760868	mathematical optimization;machine learning;probability;mathematics;estimation theory;statistics	ML	54.09822293160921	3.163706174219498	165974

Such a problem having quadraticity is relatively easily solved, and most variations of the linear quadratic control problem for which exact solutions are known possess this property. A generally less tractable set of problems is that consisting of nonneutral models, those in which it is possible to learn about system unknowns through experimentation. It is shown that quadraticity and neutrality apparently neither imply nor preclude one another within the class of linear quadratic models.		Carole Aldrich;David W.

5931b98147a9120aa0b483d6c1cd4f7f53e06a79	finite time attack detection and supervised secure state estimation for cpss with malicious adversaries		Abstract In this paper, we investigate the finite time attack detection and secure state estimation problem for linear cyber physical systems (CPS) with s out of p sensors being attacked. By exploring the distinct properties of the undetectable and indistinguishable attacks to a CPS, novel explicit criteria on the detectability and distinguishability of the CPS under attack are proposed in terms of the r -resilient observability. This enables us to explicitly characterize the undetectable and/or indistinguishable attacks to the CPS. Then based on such characterization, we propose a finite time detector to solve the attack detection problem and a finite time alarm event driven supervised estimator to solve the secure state estimation problem, separately. Theoretical analysis shows that, the proposed detector and estimator can detect attacks and estimate the state within a prescribed finite time, respectively. Finally, some numerical simulations on an unmanned ground vehicle as an illustration of attack detection and secure state estimation is proposed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.	secure state	Wei Ao;Yongduan Song;Changyun Wen;Jun-Feng Lai	2018	Inf.

cc1ee8fce2f25244647e14d618f18d516d8b3d04	a modified system order estimation for system identification of structures with modal interference		When performing a modal analysis of a structural system with close modes or high damping, the results of identification may be poor due to modal interference, which refers to the phenomenon that vibration energy of each mode of a system may overlap with other modes within certain frequency range, the estimation of system order is thus important to the effectiveness of modal identification. In this paper, by introducing the concept of the singular value decomposition (SVD) in Ibrahim Time-Domain method (ITD), and the order of system matrix is efficiently determined, and the modal identification of a system with close modes through the ITD method can then be well implemented. Numerical simulation of one example of a model of the railway vehicle, confirm the validity of the proposed method for system identification of a structure with modal interference.	frequency band;interference (communication);modal logic;numerical method;simulation;singular value decomposition;system identification	Wei-Cheng Chen;Jyun-Yan Chuang;Chang-sheng Lin	2017	2017 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)	10.1109/SII.2017.8279251	engineering;control engineering;structural system;modal;modal analysis;computer simulation;system identification;singular value decomposition;vibration;phenomenon	EDA	55.114402940640566	0.9027769343025143	172088

487e75a2529d600efaa2df983d3e132be002ba90	particle filter joint state and parameter estimation of dynamic power systems		Intermittent renewable energy sources in distributed generation will increase the chance of sudden unpredictable changes in the system states and parameters of dynamic power systems. To track the changes of the power systems, system state and parameter estimation methods that can track the near real-time dynamics of the power systems are needed. Power system operators still employ simulation studies using off-line models that are built based on prior knowledge gained through information via simulated typical scenarios which does not make use of posterior knowledge of neither parameter space nor state space of the dynamics of the power systems. Dynamic models of a power system has increasingly more important role in power system operations since they impact the operational conditions of dynamical power system. In this study, we propose a particle filter based state and parameter estimation method to improve modelling accuracy, which determines the best set of model parameters using real-time measurement data. This can be achieved via measurements by Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) or Remote Terminal Units (RTU) that can capture the system dynamic responses in real time. In addition, parameters of the system can also be estimated. Herein the load will be the parameter of the system that needs to be estimated jointly with the states. Joint state and parameter estimation for power systems via employing Bayesian particle filter is being introduced in this study.	dynamical system;estimation theory;ibm power systems;online and offline;particle filter;phasor;power management unit;real-time clock;real-time computing;remote terminal unit;simulation;state space;sysop;system dynamics;system of measurement	Muhammed Akif Ulker;Bahri Uzunoglu	2016	2016 57th International Scientific Conference on Power and Electrical Engineering of Riga Technical University (RTUCON)	10.1109/EUROCON.2017.8011142	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	EDA	54.361826250785	-0.7230343709667924	172879

Since each individual subfilter of the IM filter is updated adaptively using the combined information of the estimates from the subfilters, it can converge into a true steady state irrespective of the initial heading of a vehicle containing the navigation system. Thereby the IM filter can provide a stable navigation solution. For the subfilters of the IM filter, a simplified UKF is presented. This has a mixed structure of the extended Kalman filter and UKF and has a lighter computational load than the UKF in the multirate INS/GPS integration. Also, simplified UKF-based subfilters for the INS/GPS-integrated navigation system are designed. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to validate the performance of the proposed IM filter, and an experiment is carried out to confirm the simulation results.	converge;course (navigation);extended kalman filter;filter bank;global positioning system;inertial navigation system;interaction;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;real-time clock;sensor;simulation;smoothing;steady state	Seong Yun Cho	2014	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2014.130128	control engineering;computer vision;invariant extended kalman filter;gps/ins;fast kalman filter;engineering;control theory;sensor fusion;extended kalman filter;moving horizon estimation;alpha beta filter;simultaneous localization and mapping	Robotics	55.53998012480077	2.9281006842967012	174482

The reliability of the optimization algorithm to estimate the parameters values of the equivalent electrical model is also studied and discussed.

It is a useful parameter estimation method when the observation model and/or the state transition model is not a linear function. However, the computational requirements in EKF are a difficulty for the system. With the help of cognition-based designation and the Taylor expansion method, a novel algorithm is proposed to ease the computational load for EKF in azimuth predicting and localizing under a nonlinear observation model. When there are nonlinear functions and inverse calculations for matrices, this method makes use of the major components (according to current performance and the performance requirements) in the Taylor expansion. As a result, the computational load is greatly lowered and the performance is ensured. Simulation results show that the proposed measure will deliver filtering output with a similar precision compared to the regular EKF. At the same time, the computational load is substantially lowered.	algorithm;cognition;computation;computer performance;estimation theory;extended kalman filter;fear, uncertainty and doubt;hospital admission;identifier;linear function;lowered (qualifier value);nonlinear system;population parameter;radar;requirement;simulation;smoothing;state transition table	Yanpeng Li;Xiang Li;Bin Deng;Hongqiang Wang;Yuliang Qin	2014		10.3390/s141223067	invariant extended kalman filter;text mining;telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;data science;taylor series;data mining;extended kalman filter;statistics	Robotics	55.45084028470504	2.6874169389467037	182616

Considering imperfections of the cardinalized probability hypothesis density (CPHD) filter and the target maneuvers, we propose an adaptive genetic multiple-model CPHD filter in this paper. First, we discuss the filtering process and combined the standard CPHD filter with the multiple-model-based framework. Afterward, the sequential Monte Carlo implementation of the proposed filter for the nonlinear and non-Gaussian state estimates is presented in detail. To enhance the tracking performance as target start to maneuver, the adaptive genetic algorithm is used to improve the target state estimation accuracy at the time of state switching with the excellent particles. On the other hand, the undetected component of the measurementupdated weight of survival particle is compensated by the excess weight of newborn particle to correct the number estimates of targets.

Models highlight various trends and patterns. However, producing accurate models is challenging as different errors are introduced by sampling platforms with limited resources, e.g., insufficient sampling rates, data loss due to buffer overwriting, reduced communication bandwidth, and long communication delays. Furthermore, the dynamics of the environment, like mobile energy sources and sinks, might further increase errors as resources must be shared between the sampling and communication activities. This paper presents a procedure to systematically construct robust data models using samples acquired through a grid network of embedded sensing devices with limited resources, like bandwidth and buffer memory. Models are in the form of ordinary differential equations. The procedure constructs local data models by lumping state variables. Local models are then collected centrally to produce global models. The proposed modeling scheme uses a linear programming formulation to compute the lumping level at each node, and the parameters of the networked sensing platform, i.e., best data communication paths and bandwidths. Two algorithms are described to predict the trajectories of mobile energy sources/sinks as predictions can further reduce data loss and delays during communication. The computed parameters and trajectory predictions are used to configure the local decision making routines of the networked sampling nodes. Even though the procedure can be used to model a broader set of phenomena, experiments discuss the effectiveness of the method for thermal modeling of ULTRASPARC Niagara T1 architecture. Experiments show that the presented method reduces the overall error between 58.29% and 76.91% with an average of 68.87%, and communication delay between -11.49% and 57.62% with an average of 21.85%.	algorithm;data model;data modeling;embedded system;experiment;grid network;linear programming formulation;lumpers and splitters;mathematical optimization;overwriting (computer science);sampling (signal processing);ultrasparc t1	Anurag Umbarkar;Varun Subramanian;Alex Doboli	2014	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2014.2334295	control engineering;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science	EDA	56.0075835537462	-2.8392371943348147	186058

In order to identify load for linear systems and nonlinear systems, this paper presents methods to identify load for a cantilever beam based on dynamic strain measurement by Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. For linear systems, the proposed inverse method consists of Kalman filter with no load terms and a linear estimator. For nonlinear systems, the proposed inverse method consists of cubature Kalman filter (CKF) with no load terms and a nonlinear estimator. In the process of load identification, the state equations of the beam structures are constructed by using the finite element method (FEM). Kalman filter or CKF is used to suppress noise. The residual innovation sequences, gain matrix, and innovation covariance generated by Kalman filter or CKF are used to identify a load. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, numerical simulations and experiments of the beam structures are employed and the results show that the method has an excellent performance.	computer simulation;experiment;fiber optic technology;fiber to the x;finite element method;kalman filter;linear system;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical integration;structural integrity and failure;sensor (device)	Xuegang Song;Yuexin Zhang;Dakai Liang	2017		10.3390/s17081733	electronic engineering;cantilever;engineering;fiber bragg grating;invariant extended kalman filter;kalman filter;nonlinear system;finite element method;linear system;extended kalman filter;control theory	Robotics	55.64727710931727	-0.7230131516882532	186801

Comparatively, simple mean value engine models (MVEM) describe the slow changes of the averaged states for automotive control and fault diagnosis. In this paper, a bank of state estimators based on MVEMs is used for fault residual generation. Three faults: 1) throttle mass air-flow sensor fault; 2) exhaust gas recirculation valve sensor fault; and 3) exhaust leak fault are considered here. These faults are significant as they affect emission levels. Optimized thresholds for residual classification are derived for minimizing false alarm rates and missed detection rates. The diagnosis logic, based on the principles of structured residuals proposed in literature, is extended here for multiple hypotheses testing. Furthermore, the Dempster-Shafer theory is used to associate a confidence measure with the decision conclusions and this is shown to improve isolation. Performance is demonstrated with automotive engine data obtained from a four-cylinder instantaneous spark-ignition engine (gasoline) system model, developed in the simulation software AMESim.	algorithm;computation;computer performance;cylinder seal;existential quantification;experiment;fault coverage;fault detection and isolation;fault model;kaisa nyberg;lms imagine.lab amesim;on-board data handling;provable security;pulse (signal processing);real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;schedule (computer science);sensor;simulation software;test data;thresholding (image processing)	Jonathan Z.

Since the motion model of the target is not known a priori, either robust modeling techniques or adaptive modeling techniques are required. The neural extended Kalman filter is a technique that learns unmodeled dynamics while performing state estimation in the feedback loop of a control system. This coupled system performs the standard estimation of the states of the plant while estimating a function to approximate the difference between the given state-coupling function model and the behavior of the true plant dynamics. At each sample step, this new model is added to the existing model to improve the state estimate. The neural extended Kalman filter has also been investigated as a target tracking estimation routine. Implementation issues for this adaptive modeling technique, including neural network training parameters, were investigated and an analysis was made of the quality of performance that the technique can have for tracking maneuvering targets.

The RBO is an efficient real-time method designed for measuring the harmonic components of periodic signals. Recently, some experiments have shown that RBO can tolerate some data loss, but no exact criteria of the convergence have been available. The main contribution of this paper is a set of conditions which enable to predict whether the observer is able to find the harmonic components or not. The necessary condition of convergence helps to recognize the situations when the error-free estimation of the harmonic components is not possible. The sufficient conditions of convergence give safe regions of data loss parameters (e.g., data loss ratio) where the unbiased harmonic estimation can always be ensured. Simulations are also presented to demonstrate the effect of data loss in different situations.	computer simulation;experiment;lossy compression;real-time clock;real-time computing	GyÃ¶rgy Orosz;LÃ¡szlÃ³ Sujbert;GÃ¡bor PÃ©celi	2013	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2012.2215071	control engineering;electronic engineering;convergence;harmonic analysis;control theory;mathematics;resonator;estimation theory;quantum mechanics;statistics	Metrics	59.89698630466476	3.9047033015399824	190511

For computational solution of DDP it is proposed an efficient numerical procedure, which gives the solution directly in the form of constraints on some parameters of the control matrix. For computational solution of the optimization problem, it is proposed a specialized hybrid descent method, suitable for problems with severe control structural constraints, composed by a sequence of steps of the following methods: Modified Newton, Newton's and Quasi-Newton. The results are illustrated by a numerical example.	computation;coupling (computer programming);data-directed programming;differential dynamic programming;linear system;mathematical optimization;newton;numerical analysis;optimization problem;stochastic gradient descent;time-invariant system	Carlos Eduardo Trabuco DÃ³rea;BasÃ­lio E.

47b8cb8aebebdd5d1fa9cc6acd376cfb0ed85791	an mpc-based control structure selection approach for simultaneous process and control design	simultaneous design and control;model predictive control;control structure selection	An optimization framework that addresses the simultaneous process and control design of chemical systems including the selection of the control structure is presented. Different control structures composed of centralized and fully decentralized predictive controllers are considered in the analysis. The system's dynamic performance is quantified using a variability cost function that assigns a cost to the worst-case closed-loop variability, which is calculated using analytical bounds derived from tests used for robust control design. The selection of the controller structure is based on a communication cost term that penalizes pairings between the manipulated and the controlled variables based on the tuning parameters of the MPC controller and the process gains. Both NLP and MINLP formulations are proposed. The NLP formulation is shown to be faster and converges to a similar solution to that obtained with the MINLP formulation. The proposed methods were applied to a wastewater treatment industrial plant.	control flow	Gloria GutiÃ©rrez;Luis A. Ricardez-Sandoval;Hector M.

The tight interaction between information technology and the physical world has introduced new vulnerabilities that cannot be addressed with the use of standard cryptographic security techniques. Accordingly, the problem of state estimation in the presence of sensor and actuator attacks has attracted significant attention in the past. Unlike the existing work, in this paper, we consider the problem of attack-resilient state estimation in the presence of bounded-size noise. We focus on the most general model for sensor attacks where <italic>any</italic> signal can be injected via compromised sensors. Specifically, we present an <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$l_0$</tex-math></inline-formula>-based state estimator that can be formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and its convex relaxation based on the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$l_1$</tex-math></inline-formula> norm. For both attack-resilient state estimators, we derive rigorous analytic bounds on the state-estimation errors caused by the presence of noise. Our analysis shows that the worst-case error is linear with the size of the noise and, thus, the attacker cannot exploit the noise to introduce unbounded state-estimation errors. Finally, we show how the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$l_0$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$l_1$</tex-math></inline-formula>-based attack-resilient state estimators can be used for sound attack detection and identification; we provide conditions on the size of attack vectors that ensure correct identification of compromised sensors."""	best, worst and average case;cryptography;dynamical system;linear programming relaxation;sensor	Miroslav Pajic;Insup Lee;George J.

The complexity of power systems is growing thus challenging the way measurements for state estimation are traditionally managed. Following a previous experience in defining a decentralized solution for state estimation, the authors here propose a procedure to automatically identify how and what state information to exchange for reconstructing the state starting from partial knowledge. In particular the problem of selecting the variable that each observer has to estimate is partially solved within the framework of stochastic systems. An optimization algorithm based on dynamic programming (DP) is developed to determine the optimal set of strongly coupled variables necessary for a sufficiently accurate estimation. The developed procedure is evaluated in simulation. Preliminary results relevant to a small network are presented to show the validity of the proposed approach.	algorithm;collocation;coupling (computer programming);data integrity field;dynamic programming;estimation theory;ibm power systems;kalman filter;mathematical optimization;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;stochastic process;test case	Andrea Benigni;Junqi Liu;Ferdinanda Ponci;Antonello Monti;Giuditta Pisano;Sara Sulis	2010	2010 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference Proceedings	10.1109/TIM.2011.2124270	control engineering;stochastic process;mathematical optimization;computer science;control theory;mathematics;electric power system;statistics	EDA	59.49916274521862	0.4290198823066548	193744

For the vector-state system, only the characteristic function of the conditional probability density function (pdf), and not the pdf itself, can be expressed analytically in a closed form. Consequently, the conditional performance index formulated for the controller design can also be evaluated only in the spectral domain. In particular, by taking the conditional expectation of an objective function that is a product of functions resembling Cauchy pdfs, the conditional performance index is obtained in closed form by using Parseval's identity and integrating over the spectral vector. This forms a deterministic, non-convex function of the control signal and the measurement history that must be optimized numerically at each time step. A two-state example is used to expose the interesting robustness characteristics of the proposed controller.	additive model;characteristic function (convex analysis);convex function;dynamical system;linear system;loss function;numerical analysis;optimization problem;portable document format;stochastic control	Javier H.

The objective of BMS is to adaptively estimate state of charge (SOC) - a crucial battery state information. We find that the existing approaches in the literature need enhancement because (i) they lack battery equivalent models that accurately model the actual physical and chemical properties of the batteries, and (ii) they fail to utilize powerful state and parameter estimation techniques for system identification and tracking. It is often noticed throughout the literature that (ii) is a precursor to (i). In this paper, first we model the dynamic equivalent model of batteries as a series of m parallel RC circuits and derive the relationship between the time-varying battery states and the current, voltage output observations as a non-linear state space model. Then, we derive an expectation maximization (EM) type algorithm for identification of the so-derived statespace model and for the adaptive tracking of SOC. Finally we discuss the performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm through simulation and by testing them on experimental data obtained from Li-ion based cellphone batteries.	battery management system;bridge management system;computational complexity theory;equivalent circuit;estimation theory;expectationâmaximization algorithm;mobile phone;nonlinear system;performance evaluation;rc circuit;simulation;state of charge;state-space representation;system identification;on-line system	Balakumar Balasingam;Bharath R.

Unlike existing works that focus on detection and filtering algorithms for the observer, we study the problem from the attacker's point-of-view. In our model, the attacker can corrupt the measurements by adding spoofing signals. The attacker seeks to create a separation between the estimate of the Kalman filter with and without spoofing signals. We present a number of results on how to generate such spoofing signals, while minimizing the signal magnitude. The resulting algorithms are evaluated through simulations along with theoretical proofs.	algorithm;kalman filter;simulation;spoofing attack	Zhongshun Zhang;Lifeng Zhou;Pratap Tokekar	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8430817	control theory;computer science;observer (quantum physics);kalman filter;magnitude (mathematics);filter (signal processing);spoofing attack	Robotics	56.734988515393475	0.43151151033306984	196957
fd41dad06a34be55241e5ec976a9f6b0f99dc9f9	a tutorial on real-time convex optimization based guidance and control for aerospace applications		Challenging control problems are ubiquitous in aerospace engineering applications. Such applications include reusable rockets, spacecraft rendezvous and docking, satellite constellation management for terrestrial imaging, and many other ones where vehicles are required to perform reliably while adhering to physical and mission constraints. Physical constraints are due to limitations like finite fuel, whereas mission constraints can arise from sensor pointing requirements or safety keep-out zones. Often, mission success necessitates that these constraints be satisfied in real-time, using limited on-board computational resources. In this paper, we present a tutorial on how to formulate some aerospace control problem examples in an optimization based control framework. Specifically, we decompose the control problem into two levels: guidance (trajectory optimization), and feedback control. In guidance, we use recent convexification results to formulate non-convex trajectory optimization problems as finite-dimensional convex optimization problems, which we solve using fast and reliable Interior Point Method (IPM) algorithms. We discuss the current state of the art of convexification techniques, and outline the context in which these techniques should be used. Lastly, we present an overview of synthesis methods for feedback control laws. These control laws are used to track the guidance trajectories within specified error bounds, and in the presence of model uncertainties and environmental disturbances.	algorithm;computational resource;convex hull;convex optimization;docking (molecular);feedback;interior point method;mathematical optimization;on-board data handling;program optimization;real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;terrestrial television;trajectory optimization	Yuanqi Mao;Michael Szmuk;BehÃ§et AÃ§ikmese	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8430984	satellite constellation;control engineering;computer science;rendezvous;trajectory optimization;convex function;convex optimization;aerospace;optimal control;interior point method	Robotics	58.84274413816192	-2.3997444126638525	197302

The relative navigation provides the estimation of the relative attitude and relative orbit between spacecraft, which is a challenging filtering problem since it is a highly nonlinear and high dimensional estimation problem. Many filters have been used to solve this problem, such as, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). However, these filters are not accurate enough when the initial uncertainty is large or the nonlinearity is significant. Moreover, although the conventional Gauss-Hermite quadrature filter is more accurate than the UKF, it cannot be used since a huge number of points is required. It is shown in this paper that the sparse Gauss-Hermite quadrature filter can achieve better estimation accuracy than the EKF, the UKF, and the cubature Kalman filter without excessive computation load.	computation;estimation theory;extended kalman filter;gaussâhermite quadrature;nonlinear system;numerical integration;quadrature filter;sparse matrix	Bin Jia;Ming Xin;Yang Cheng	2012	2012 American Control Conference (ACC)		kalman filter;control engineering;computer vision;estimation;navigation;invariant extended kalman filter;ensemble kalman filter;noise measurement;unscented transform;root-raised-cosine filter;filtering problem;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;accuracy and precision;attitude control;extended kalman filter;moving horizon estimation;filter design;statistics;alpha beta filter	Robotics	56.304406932589444	3.2509320141722644	197866
